N7UCCGDDaa	hey i totally understand what you're going through, im actually in your exact same place right now. my problem is i always seem to attract guys that aren't datable you know and i never can find really good nice guys who are interested in me. i can't really give you the best advice since i am in your place right now. but i think that by the way you describe yourself, im sure that you probably are attracting guys but maybe some of them are just afraid to talk to you. this has happened to me on quite a few occasions. they probably figure that since you are pretty and funny and outgoing that you wounldn't even give them the time of day. if this is the case the best thing to do is to just keep talking to more people and try to find guys that you really click with and can talk to you know and eventually things will work out. but don't be discouraged there are plenty of girls out there in your same place. it seems that a lot of times the best girls are overlooked. but what i tell myself is that in a way its kind of a positive thing because you won't have to experience all the pain and heartache that can come with relationships. hopefully you'll get a great guy who's more mature since you are getting older now and hopefully it will come soon. stay strong though, they say good things come to those who wait and i know it may seem like forever but i know that if you really are a great girl someday soon you'll attract a great guy that you love|`|tuo697SCaa	This is what I am afraid of myself. I want to have some guy for once in my life like me. I suggest doing something that you dont normally do because that might do something which is what I want to do myself|`|NA2bsf4baa	You are still young, and this is a blessing, believe me. You're the perfect age to start dating. You're not the jaded, young teen girl. You have a mind, and you're attractive. Since you are outgoing, just meet and befriend more males, try meeting and befriending guys that are in activities you like or interest you. Then do those hobbies together. You'll find not only will you have a great friend, but the great potential for a boyfriend that actually works. Don't be afraid to ask guys out as well!|`|z5hehD8kaa	well i dont know you but are u a picky women? cause if u are then theres ur problem|`|plGuYnNDaa	I know exactly what you mean but you just have to be patient and be more open to guys that might be interested in you. because i know im too picky when it ocmes to guys so thats why i have never had a boyfriend. It could also be something about your personality that guys might not like. Try to be more spunky and outgoing and you may get noticed.. But dont worry about being alone your whole life.. you will find someone eventually :):)|`|OIiYXP3Daa	i would need to see a picture of you to tell conclusively.|`|hXFndli2aa	Well maybe because the right guy has not yet appeared. Im sure that you have guys after you but you are just not interested in them and there is nothing wrong with that. Another thing is you should go out more like clubbing party's im sure you'll meet someone that is attracted to you. If your in college im sure you'll allsom meet someone there. Keep your head up, you are still so young and u have alot of time to find the person that is right 4 u.
qT8yID3Taa	well, you could have said it nicer. but it happened to me too, i was like "i think im just going with friends"  but dont worry! obviously you didn't like him so, you cant force yourself to do something you dont wanna do.   it's fine girl, he probably knows know that your just not interested in him. if anything he'll move on. i hope this helped!|`|sOGrOWvHaa	ummmm...  i dont want to make u feel bad or anything cuz its also happened to me but i said it nicley i mean i guess he really likes u u could just have said "srry but im kind of tired" or "no thanx" cuz if u said uhhhhhhh thats so not cool and i do think it was pretty mean maybe u shuld go and say srry  ull feel better and hell feel better but maybe u should make it clear that u dont like him like that :]|`|fnUBPmm1aa	you dont have to do anything that you dont want.      but if you really want to make him happy ,,just  walk up to him  and  kiss  him   he will  be really glad|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	I think you need to do this with kit gloves ... be HOT and show him a nice formal,2 step but make sure he can DANCE first before you loose a possible keeper .  You don't want to be with a old fool! Put your grove on girl !|`|JpuWdGLRaa	im sorry but the way you said it made it sound like he was the worst kid alive. remember that looks ARENT everything!!!!!! that 'nerd' could be the one, you never know. you should totally go out with him for like a week and see how you feel (and i mean REALLY feel, not how you WANT to feel) and at least let him feel happy. let him have some fun. at least be really good friends with him. its the best you can do. 'and he looked like, REALLY crushed' and i bet he was!!!!!!!! if it took that much courage, at least say you will think about it. gosh have a heart.|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	well its best not to get his hopes up    and him be even more crushed later.|`|Ly605111aa	you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do... i think you did the right thing... i have a stalker and if he asked me to dance i would turn him down because i would be scared of where he might think it is going.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you should go to him and explain what you are feeling. maybe you guys can be friends.
JwqPNs4Qaa	Ok, first of all, no one is weird. There's really no such thing as normal because everyone's different. Let them know that ur not weird!|`|MpKU6BPgaa	that's silly! maybe you should be more open and lively. talk to everyone and don't be shy, everyone will love you. good luck|`|7fPCeO8Daa	well do you have friends?  e-mail me   copeland.evelyn@yahoo.com
ZP30wbvYaa	who cares if your mom goes and acts like a crazy woman in front of the principal??? you need to tell her, and also talk to the dean about what happened on the bus, so maybe you can get out of your detention. what that kid did is unacceptable, and whether you like it or not, people might call you a tattle tale. stick up for yourself woman!!   haha, i'm one to tallk. anyway, im proud of you for not hitting him back or anything like that, it would have probably just gotten you in bigger trouble. but seriously, tell your mom, tell the dean, and i would possibly talk to the bus driver. sorry, and good luck.|`|NSuilHx1aa	duuuude im sorry that sucks big time!  but i would try and find a different way of getting to and from school so you can avoid the kid...but if you can, maybe try talking to him and ask what the hell is wrong with him...but im not an expert|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I know it sucks but you need to tell your mother. It is not ok for someone to hit you EVER. She should make a big deal out of it because it is a big deal. Don't worry about people thinking that you tattled, you didn't. This kid overstepped his bounds, it doesn't even matter that he is older.|`|ZuLjIHgUaa	you need to talk straightly to that Person. he might think that you are afraid of him and stuff. let Your Brother talk to him.. and if this wont stop tell the Pricipal the truth.. Its not Your Problem. U dont even know y he does that to u.|`|2M4vSXkqaa	You may not want to do this but the best thing is to talk to your principal. nothing will get solved if ignoring didn't work, unless you take matters to an adult. another thing you can do is sit in the front of the buss where you're in plain view of the driver. Have your friend sit with you if you not comfortable doing that. And thank your friend for telling the bus driver, she was sticking up for you in a way so don't be mad at her for getting you in detention.|`|xNYUZZvlaa	Try to talking to your bus driver, tell her that he's been bugging you a lot. Maybe you can get your seat changed.   With that guy, tell him off... Not like cussing or anything. Just speak up and stand up for yourself.   If you know that you didn't tattle, then don't worry about what everyone else thinks.   Talk to your brother, tell him that you can fight your own battles and with your mom, you should tell her about it and also tell her that you can handle it yourself and that she doesn't have to make a big deal out of it(:  Hope it helps.
oUuDyzVmaa	omg im having the same problemo! u see im actually usually realy quite talkative but it just all cahnged and i became shy... what i realised through this is you just HAVE to forget about ur shyness and LAUGH. u gotta LAUGH LOUDLY, even if it is too loud and everybody looks :) practice this with ur closer friends first to build confidence. just ramble on about anything and if its that random, u may evenn get a laugh :) maybe just ask the girl "omg this clas is so boring, dont u think?" ort something. i really dont no but i have the same problem with conversatoins and am still not that good at keeping one going but with practice and time, it will eventually come naturally :) good luck and ur not alone XD|`|UF9MVdSXaa	I'm having the same problem!      Do they like a certain type of music, sport, etc?    That's something you could talk about.    Since I'm in the same situation I really dunno what to do!      Hope I helped ya!|`|glynFK9haa	I had that issue last year in seventh grade, but I didn't even stay friends with those people very long.  I'm only friends with one now, sort of.
aDL7xmt6aa	He's honest.  Wait until he's at least 30.|`|XTBlOf9baa	Well. First of all, he's still technically married. He's 24 with one failed marriage under his belt already? Yeah, he's probably apprehensive about starting another marriage right now. Secondly, his first wife cheated on him while he was in Iraq. As an Army wife, I ALWAYS tell people NOT to get married until they've been through a deployment together. He probably wants to make sure the two of you are strong enough to get through it. He sounds like a smart man. He's not stringing you along or anything, he's just being smart.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If he says he isn't ready, he isn't ready. He may not be ready for a long time, like a couple of years or more. Are you willing to wait?    Just because he is going on deployment next month is not a reason to get married.    If you love him and are willing to wait for him to be ready to marry you, then I advise you to give him some more time. Getting married isn't about the wedding. It is about spending the rest of your lives together through thick and thin. Do you really want to marry someone who doesn't know if he is doing the right thing?    Imagine standing at the altar and him thinking, "What am I doing? Am I really ready for this?" Would YOU want to be rushed into it?|`|aSjHI5jUaa	you're both toooo young...i was 25 when i got married it lasted a year...live with eachother for a few years and then see if you can stand him for more than a year!!|`|qpAYU8Knaa	That means he is sure that he wants to marry you but not sure about when to get married.|`|rno6XarMaa	Wow.  You answered your own question.  He is not ready, he said it himself, and unless you want to push him right out of your life, you must respect that!    If he says he wants to eventually, believe him, and try to be patient.  Why the huge rush?  Not only that, he isn't even through with his divorce.  Believe me, that is a HUGE emotional and financial drain on a person, whether he still loves her or not.      He needs to see that you are patient, understanding and willing to let him get through some of his own issues.  Do not suggest wedding ring shopping again, and let him do the talking.|`|0AShsMsoaa	it means he wants to date you until he leaves. nothing more.|`|vFCva8R5aa	I think it means he is not ready yet    Give him some time, I mean his divorce is not even finalized yet. Divorce can be traumatic to people|`|dVlLahozaa	he's not ready and you shouldn't pressure him. he just got out of a marriage and you are trying to get right into another one. Chill and take it slower.|`|AA11481889	You're both practically infants.    Marriage is a life long commitment that shouldn't be taken lightly.  He's already made one hasty mistake...he's smart to want to take it slow.    Marriage isn't something that should be rushed into.  Take your time.  There is no reason not to wait until you get to actually be with him.      Dating a guy for a few months, and then "dating" him while he's deployed for 7 months, and then dating him again...does not constitute a relationship worthy of marriage.    Wait til he comes home for good.  Get to know him for real.  Wait until he has affairs in order (he's not even divorced yet for crying out loud)...and if you both can stick together through all of that....THEN you start THINKING about marriage.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	He means exactly what he says. He loves you, wants to be with you but doesn't want to get married.    Maybe he doesn't think you're old enough yet, or doesn't feel comfortable making it official so soon after his divorce.    If he asks you if you want to marry him, tell him the truth.  If you don't answer, he might think you don't want to get married.       And, honestly, I think it would bepointless for you two to get married, and then he leaves right away. You would be married, but not together. Why would anyone want that?|`|9ykAQxJxaa	Oh man...I am going to be very honest....not to scare you, not to upset you, not to worry you...but you need to understand this:    First off, he is just coming out of divorce...that is enough to shake anyone's life up.  I believe he needs to actually make the divorce official before he can even think about moving onto the next step.    Secondly, and again not to worry you, but take it from me for what it's worth.  I too dated a guy who ended up becoming a marine and going to Iraq.  We talked about marriage, but ended up breaking up (it's a long story).  Anyways, we were both very upset, but eventually moved on to other people.  Well, he started dating someone else for about 6 months, and he proposed to her because he didn't want to lose her when he went off to Iraq.  Well, he was deployed and suppoed to be gone for 7 months.  Well, he died.  He got bombed and he never came back...and not only was I devastated, but the girl who he ended up proposing to was also hysterical.    Listen, my point of the story - he might not be ready yet because he first needs to get through his first divorce, and secondly, he probably wants to get through this next 6-7 months that he's going to be away, and he wants to make sure that nothing will happen to him.  Seriously sweetie, imagine if (god forbid) something DID happen...and you were already engaged.  It's not that he doesn't love you, but to be involved in all that wedding planning and to have such a tragedy like that happen...you don't want to experience that.    I truly believe that that is part of his reason for saying he is not ready.  He is probably thinking of your life and doesn't want you left stranded if again, god forbid, something did in fact happen to him.  Trust me, he's doing the least selfish thing possible by making you wait a little while longer.    Good luck.|`|NpcSEJX1aa	tell him let looks at ring to gether and plan the wedding when you return.. and go from there..no need to hurry this along.. if you are willing to wait it may make him feel more comfy|`|xIwPjhojaa	What is marriage??( it is nothing other than out-dated) and he is playing YOU .no one should even think at 23-30 about marriage and only the attorneys are HAPPY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we live in a disposable society And the children are the ones that SUFFER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Your a young romantic , you will learn the hard way good luck !!!
tdN2ouxAaa	There's no definitive age as to when you should have your first kiss.    No one should win your bet, because it can only be answered upon a case-by-case basis.    Try betting on something that can actually be PROVEN.|`|F5WQYdN6aa	whenever you feel right, i personally did in 4th grade while i was at the skating rink and there was a play think there and i was in the top of it and we decided to. i really dont think much of first kisses, just whenever you want.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	8th and higher, but depends on the person.|`|aIEkNM0Paa	I say get a life|`|z7Zb1jY2aa	There is no 'appropriate' age. but i would say 5th grade or higher|`|b70DKNLvaa	i did in 6th grade but i didnt make out till 8th grade|`|8pw8qDjPaa	i didnt have my first kiss till i was 14 (a week before my 15th birthday)    i think thats pretty normal. i couldnt have imagined kissing anyone when i was younger then that.    but hell, there are 13 year olds having sex (disgusting!!) so who the hell knows anymore.|`|AA11309904	13.|`|RReigeBsaa	Don't go tryin' to kiss every girl that smiles at you, haha. Just get it over with before college and you should be golden.|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	There is no age limit.  That's just silly, by your reasoning, if you don't have a kiss by your 21, does that mean you aren't a man?|`|d7SdhXm3aa	Whenever you fins that perfect someone that you want to share your first kiss with.   7th grade and lower is ridiculous in my opinion.   I mean grade schoolers kissing on the playground?  To me, that's weird.   Middle school is when stuff like that should be first starting, I'd say 7th grade and up.|`|CZLpTU8iaa	There is NO age! I had my first kiss when I was 9! If your talking about tongue then 12 or 13! That's my opinion though!  BTW, people above me! 6th grade and up is middle schoolers! Not 7th grade and up. K - 5th grade is elementary school. 6th - 8th grade is middle school. 9th - 12th grade is high school!|`|na8ObA5Haa	i had my first kiss when i was 15 with a 17 year old.   but i am a girl so that was ok.     in your case since you are a guy 15 is the right age to have your fist kiss|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	you should probably hook up with a chick before highschool    and it doesnt have to be a girlfriend    put the moves on a chick :]|`|tCPIxvvwaa	sorry but Calvin is right.|`|bTgF1Azgaa	most people i know havent had there first kiss or they have had it a long time ago, so it dependes on the person and there social life i guess|`|J10OUq6Xaa	12.5000000000000000000000000000000000000...
Z8TDYoQqaa	ok these girls are not your friends if they just turn their backs on you cuz a senior has a problem with you. i'm sorry you got injured but it is not the end of the world. your upset everything seems worse than it really is. just rest and get better and start making other friends. keep on running don't let them get to you. if you love to run then keep on running! who cares if those girls don't want you there! you don't need them! just start talking to other people and make new friends. so breathe and think positive ;) be confident and happy! those girls will see what they missed out on!|`|GOYPKp3Baa	Well first of all, this all sounds like this senior girl is jealous of you - Don't let that get in your way of fufilling your dream. She can hate on you all you want but it is your choice to let that ruin you. It doesnt matter if they like you or not, what matters is you doing what you do best, running. Don't let the things you cant do interfere with what you can do. Good luck :) Just keep up your hard work and pay no attention to them.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You should talk to your coach about how you're feeling. It always helps to get things off your chest and it's important that a team be unified.
bID1Pd7Gaa	Thank you for sharing this with me.|`|PUXmTrnMaa	If your being safe, discrete and don't feel guilty about it...no harm no foul.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	What else is there?|`|3AKComGNaa	omg me 2 but i dont gotta grl 2 do it with|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Yes, when you're young, sex is very important.  I used to have to have sex in order to be in a relationship but now that I'm old...er (51) I see that it's not so much a need rather it's a desire.  I've lived without for 12 years after my ex cheated on me.  It's no big deal but while you're young it's the height of the love life.  One day in the future you to will see it really isn't must more than a desire but get it while you can...all you can.      Hope this helps.|`|JWZEuuhTaa	IKD because I am only 13. But I hear from some of my older friends that it is and it some times calms them down after a ruff day.|`|1kSRPadaaa	same. i  love it|`|8s9q4V03aa	wow ur buggn|`|BZwJeuMGaa	hmm, well you have a good sexual appetite. its important to keep a relationship going, just dont do it with too many guys / girls (if thats your thing) haha|`|ZxCK2vi9aa	It's not the most important thing... I think sexual attraction is important in a relationship, too, but a relationship should not be built just on that. But sure, it's enjoyable...|`|AA10162464	depend i you have a relationship or what stage your are on it .|`|djhCah5Maa	If I really like the person, then it is that way for me.  Right now I could care less about it.  I am having problems with my boyfriend.  I wonder if I will ever like it again.|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	It is a God-given desire that ought to be treated with dignity and respect. It is also an integral and sacred part of a relationship. So,with this in mind, BOINK your brains out as much as possible,but have some dignity about it,will ya'?    Lovin' some nasty lovin' here.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	Sex is important but only if you do it with your lover and it would be making love and no you dont need help the only way you would need help is if you were having sex with everybody i hope i helped|`|0MWmGTsgaa	Why do you need help...you're not alone in the way you feel|`|ea2747802d010df0fc2803208e162f33aa	sex is great|`|NA2bsf4baa	So where's the problem?  If you're having sex every night with multiple partners, then you have a sex addiction, this is a serious problem and there's tons of support groups to help. If you are having sex with the same person, then you have a very happy boyfriend!|`|OuU9nVLfaa	well i think you neeed to email me cause i dont get what your askinggg. (dwagley0608@yahoo.com)      well i do love sex too. and i would love to do it everynight but it could lead to alot of thing's liek aids and viruses you can even get a trac infection like i did when i was with my ex we did it everyday and he gave me a trac infection. but yes email me.|`|MiGd31Qmaa	it's not important the thing that are are like going to college not being a Hoppo or go on drugs or smoking|`|M8RtzFQEaa	ummm. yes and no..no because sex shouldnt be everything u should get on a personal level with ur boyfriend and really love him first..but when u finally do girl let him take u away(LOL)|`|ptJXvLGEaa	i just took a class on sex and i learned that it is only important that you have sex with the person you love and who loves you for who you are and even if you do love eachother there is no need for it everynight|`|OixZadrNaa	It matters who you do it with wild or one or maybe 2 don't have it every night its gonna get Addicted if you are its bad so good luck!|`|S95J0BK6aa	OHHH!!! yes its important !!!    **** if people say its not !!  its the best thing in the world !!|`|d4dhoawDaa	it is to a man, but really, the question you need to ask yourself is do you love sex or are you obsessed with it.
NOYxalJ6aa	Why do you have to feed into the Valentine's Day hype? It shouldn't matter whether a guy does anything special for that particular day or not, but how you both feel about each other.    What are you doing for him?|`|DxohE884aa	Why don't you plan something?|`|JERUmEFzaa	Maybe he wants to surprise you. Or maybe you can do something. i say you should do something.|`|RReigeBsaa	Some guys just aren't that into Valentine's Day. But if he completely blows you off -- no flowers, no mix CD, no nothin' -- talk to him about it.    Your standards are probably a little high after 4-year-ex, but it's not wrong to want the 7-monther to show he cares. Just don't expect a ring or earrings from this guy.|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	he is probably planning on surprising you    so dont get mad at him  then he wont surprise you.    especially if this would be your first valentines together and he doesnt get you anything    hes a jerk|`|K7IS3NXNaa	You definitley have the right to be upset.. maybe he's just saying that to make it more of a surprise? :)|`|wAjuh2YZaa	its probably a surprise. After if its not break up and go back to da ex|`|6CUvU9D4aa	are you sure he's not just going to surprise you ? if not, of course its natural to get used to things that are willingly given to us, but you have to be careful you don't seem shallow. sure,,,, you can be upset, but like.... its just valentine's day.|`|tXh84hzSaa	I can understand that you have become accustomed to having this day made special for you, but remember that just because he chooses not to participate in a commercial holiday is not an indication that he doesn't care. Maybe he just doesn't buy into it.  If you really want to celebrate Valentine's Day, then why don't you make the plans?
aDL7xmt6aa	So you think it's fun to become what you hate most?  That's a rather distorted view of reality.|`|k73IxCHaaa	Interesting question, I'm sure a lot of guys can relate. It's easy to become a jerk after you have been mistreated by a women, but it is much harder to become man. Everybody gets used and abused at least once in their life by someone they have loved. You can either learn from it or react to it. It sounds that in your case you have chosen the latter.    Sure there are some women out there who like bad boys and there always will be. But sooner or later they grow up and decide that they want to be respected and have a stable relationship. In the meantime while you're being  Mr Bad *** you're missing out on the opportunity to meet a really great young lady.    So if that what floats your boat for now, remember what goes around comes around. Think about it, you can get more bees with honey than you can with vinegar.|`|aSjHI5jUaa	you were such a nice guy before, what happened to you? yeah you're bitter and you've changed for the worse, no one says don't have fun but theres a limit regardless of your past.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	epiphany occurs|`|VMUwtGCuaa	you are brokenhearted|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	After my divorce, I found out that I was a 'writer'..enjoyed many different kind of sports. and become more community active..
bID1Pd7Gaa	Depends, if it's tasteful. I mean I don't want my wife wearing the ole hooker polish.|`|KcloaW4vaa	Less is more. I cant put it any simpler. Honestly when a girl puts on any kind of cosmetic or nail polish (w/e they use) its not at all a turn on to me. I honestly like seeing the girl underneath it all the most.. If i dont like whats underneath, im def not gonna like with makeup! Nail polish just loooks weird to me, thats my opinion. I would say dont use it, but really depends on if u want to or not. I wouldnt stop u from doin it but i wouldnt exactly like looking at it tobe honest.|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	it depends. maybe? sometimes.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	We don't really care about nails. :(|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Ya it looks good. I don't care either way. If shes a great girl shes a great girl. No amount of nail polish or makeup is gonna make a difference right ? Its all in you head : )|`|ArfWE1Ykaa	i'm a girl and i don't like it! nail polish feels gross and oily.|`|0MWmGTsgaa	I'm a girl & I'm not a fan, in fact nvr worn it, natural is best...when it comes to nails cus then you can see how clean a girl keeps her nails|`|uZTzird4aa	ok well im a girl...and i personally wear nail polish becasue it just makes your hands look better..a little more feminine..i mean not that a girl has man hands without nail polish, it just make's a girls hands prettier.|`|Sikav2O7aa	I'm a guy and I don't care for that, shoot, I don't care if a girl does or does not even wear makeup. I guess I'm EXTREMELY old fashion, but I would rather say I like girls that don't wear any of that kind of stuff.
NvW6voPJaa	Well, I don't know about the "best place," but I can tell you that these are ALL OVER the internet.  You can also find some dealers on Ebay that will do this.    No one knows what quality you want, and/or what you want to spend.  It's totally up to you!  Here are a few sites (out of many!):    http://www.americanbridal.com/pernap.htm...  https://www.weddingmountain.com/c-235-we...  http://www.weddingnapkins.com/
NOYxalJ6aa	Out of necessity, I moved in with a boyfriend of 8 months once. Our relationship lasted another 4 years... Worst Experience of My Life!!!    Why?    Well, we trapped ourselves. We got into a lease, so we decided we had to make it for the full year. Then after the year, it was "We've been together this long, may as well stick around longer." All emotion fell from the relationship and we started resenting each other... but we had been together so long it seemed like a waste to just throw it away, so we kept trying to keep it together which made it fall apart faster.    That was just my situation though... and the guy I was with was a total free-loader with no ambition.    Now, I'm currently in a situation where I have been dating my current boyfriend for over 2 years... I even moved to another city to be closer to him, but refused to move in with him... now, we're talking about moving in with each other and I'm terrified.     Perhaps I'm just biased... my personal opinion is to give it a bit more time before making that jump...    But my negative experience is not what everyone experiences.    I wish you luck.|`|i0DBIVc9aa	alright, my boyfriend and i moved in together after just 5 months. yes it was quick. upon doing that i had to do things i wouldn't normally do like cook all the time and make sure the house is always clean and make sure i take time to listen to him. the most important thing is that if you are comfortable then go ahead...i mean enough to fart in front of him or take a crap while he is in the house. if not then no. and just to test it out just fart one day and see what happens. i know it sounds gross but you can tell a lot about a guy by how he reacts to that. Because guys are gross and that's a natural fact.|`|AA11309904	Living in sin is wrong.|`|0MWmGTsgaa	Does it feel right? Only you can judge but from what you've told us it sounds perfect
HcBp3cFDaa	ask her.  she's prolly just shy, nervous. or scared.  or uhh maybe nervous about her body?  i'm nervous bout mine.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	well ask her of course  maybe she wants it really bad  but shes just not ready to go for it yet|`|Uy8ntukjaa	That is a question you need to ask her, when you're not in your bed.|`|EbncM0Qnaa	shes not going out with you,  and shes not a skank.
x32rh4Nqaa	No, because your mastery of the english language is a bit off.    Should I ask a girl out "through" a letter.  Unless maybe you wanted to throw it at her. lol    Man up - do it in person|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Yea.|`|KcloaW4vaa	No you shouldnt, not to sound rude... Doing it in person is not only considered better but shows the girl u have confidence. You gotta just stand up and do it. Its one ofthose things that u honest to god dont want to do but wind up finding out it was no problem at all.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Never. Do it in person.|`|SJbktLITaa	why not? Letters are never to old|`|tfkHZXYTaa	Hey dude  yeah  dont do that, i did that once and yeah  yeah just dont, take this advice from some who didtn get what he wanted lol..|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	I would say that might be a great idea.  At least she would know you were a little sincere.|`|AA10064810	Only if there is no other way to do it.  The best way is face to face.  Or, telephone.|`|XP36zr63aa	you could, but its cuter if you ask in person.  just dont have ur friends ask her out for you.  i hate that!|`|aIEkNM0Paa	sure.. but you have to write something romantic|`|auLIuEA3aa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NEVER!!!  Asking someone out and breaking up with someone through a letter or text message is not the best way to go! xD|`|NSuilHx1aa	no...unless you are in like 7th grade|`|PzbRJrTKaa	if it would be easier to you, but i would always do it in person.|`|0oiz1hySaa	no,its cute but yea us gurls like it and think its cute bt its really better if you ask in person or ova the fone|`|3AKComGNaa	girls like it better in person|`|pYHfZODGaa	if that would be easier to you.|`|8s9q4V03aa	nah,they like it in person better|`|oJ9NpqALaa	you can but i wouldn't recommend it|`|Swxir2ieaa	It'd be better to do it in person.|`|k7eIsWj6aa	If you find a special way and word it so it will be romantic I'm sure she would love it...Good Luck!|`|0MWmGTsgaa	No, talk to her|`|tD0nI64xaa	it depends on the girl|`|WPOXUtgraa	ask her face you baby|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	depends how old you are and the type of girl ... if you are in high school then I think that you should be ready to ask in person ... or atleast over the phone - to show confidence.|`|YAZBFnAIaa	maybe a cute little note. but it would be much better if you asked her in person. girls like that so much more cause they then know he's not scared to show his feelings.|`|mcpu4ZDtaa	I would say it's better if you'll ask the girl personally. It's a way of showing your sincerity and respect to her. Don't ask  her through letter. Good luck!|`|4HtmP8vHaa	you can get rejected easily in person.  because they'll be like OHMYGAH and not have time to think.    note is okay, i guess. just don't corner her down to see if she replied yet.|`|AA11309904	You need to learn to spell; no, man up and ask her our to her face.|`|na8ObA5Haa	No way thats lame and shows you dont have confidence. ask in person|`|0ox8VKwKaa	No No No Sooner or later you will have to deal with your shyness. Use this as a chance to build confidence. Get your self all settled and call her on the phone. Be prepared for no. It will happen more often than yes so get used to it. However when its meant to be you will hear yes and reap the reward of feeling the fear and doing it anyway|`|AoJ7Ntu4aa	girl hate that|`|AA10566319	Are you gay or what what kinda question is that what you expect her to do mail it back to u with yes just do urself a favor and do it in person|`|QkiYfBfHaa	NO! that's childish and out dated. The girl will appreciated if you do it in person.|`|8wS1C6Ogaa	No, because you can't spell and she will think you're an idiot.
Uy8ntukjaa	Most people choose their best friend to be their maid of honor. She may feel that you already have a special place in her life and wedding because you're sisters and she doesn't want her best friend to feel left out. Remember, this is HER wedding. You will get to plan things the way you want when you get married. Usually wedding details are planned by the bride and groom and maybe their parents. You shouldn't feel sad that you're left out of the planning process. Let her know you feel left out but remember, it's not about you. Planning a wedding is highly stressful and there isn't enough energy and time to please everyone.|`|4POGapREaa	I'm sorry but why is it that somebody ALWAYS has to be butt hurt over something?  It's one of the things that makes wedding planning such a freaking buzz kill.  I don't know, maybe I don't have the ego that a lot of people have, maybe I'm not as needy as some others.  If my very best friend of 20+ yrs that I've been through hell & back with chose someone that had been a friend for a month or two, then yeah, I would wonder.  But you just said you're not particularly close, you live on the other side of the State most likely making you unavailable at a moment's notice, and you said she's a perfectionist & you're not.  You didn't expound on that so are you flaky, not very organized?  I mean her choice is HER choice.  You have to add your sad disappointment to the mix & now everyone's mad at her.  Nice.  Being a blood relative doesn't get you an automatic in.  I can't stand my sister.  So what?  Am I obligated to do something with that?  Ugh.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	the thing is, as much as this hurts, it is HER wedding.  there is no set in stone rule saying that a sister has to be the maid of honor.      im sure your sister has her reasons for picking the friend over you,  and at the end of the day, you must realize, it is HER wedding.     like, im really not trying to sound like a *****, but you gotta realize, that sometimes you cant always get what you want, and if you try to confront her or ask her about it, its only going to make the problem worse.  so the best you can do is offer to help in any way you can, and then sit back and wait.  be gracious and happy for your sister.|`|AA11484395	Ok, now is the time to act like the bigger person. This is your moment to shine. Here is how you do it. You act like a lady. You let  your sister name anyone she wants as her maid of honor. You act as if you are very happy for her and her choices. Be understanding, offer to help, but then back off if she doesn't take you up on that offer. Do not act offended in anyway at all. As a matter of fact, go to your family and tell them to lay off your sister. Inform them that you are completely all right with her decisions and that you will be glad to help in anyway, even if all you get is the guest book attendant. Make the world believe that you love your sister, and that what she wants is fine.   After all, it is her wedding not yours. By being the 'better' person here, you come out looking fantastic to friends and family observing. Enjoy the wedding, have a better time than anyone there and hold your head up. Families get weird now and then, if you don't learn to roll with these punches they will haunt you. You know how to be gracious about this...now just follow through.|`|AA10378447	Yeah, I can understand why you're hurt, definitely. But I have to admit: first answerer has a GREAT point. You can relax, chill and not have to worry about the Bridezilla in your sister. It will be a lovely affair for you. Just think ... you won't have to lift her gown and listen to her pee!    It will be okay. Treat yourself to a movie, polish your nails and listen to your favorite music ... somthing to take your mind off it it. Eventually, you will feel happy for your sister again (and thankful that you've managed to avoid the stress)!|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	Just cos shes your sister doesn't automatically make you her "maid of honour". My mum has 4 sisters but none of them took part in the wedding other than attending you need to just be happy your even in the wedding.|`|0WstfAmzaa	I understand that you are hurt, but try and look at this way.. You get to enjoy your sister's big day without having to cater to her every whim.. Especially since you say she's a perfectionist.    Leave it alone for now.  Tell your family that you are okay with your sister's decision.  And let it go.  No point ruining your relationship with her for something as silly as a title.  It doesn't change that you're her only sister and may very well be in her life a lot longer than her college friend she chose.|`|1gDYrbTOaa	that is terrible... i'm so sorry.  you seem such a nice thoughtful sister that you even feel bad being upset about it, but i think you have a right to be. But i guess it's been decided already, after a while you have to let it go and accept it. At least you have you family to feel your pain.|`|Mai98KQLaa	It may seem really crappy right now. It will continue to feel that way all through the wedding.  When my brother got married, I was not asked to be in the wedding because my sister-in-law did not get along with my sister, who also was not asked. It turned into a terrible situation because the entire family got involved and everyone was fighting on my borther's wedding day. I had a small reading in the ceremony, but at the end of the day it didn't matter. I just felt terrible for my brother because my sister and everyone else would not let him forget it. I even got blamed for some of the hostility even though I stayed out it. All I remember about my brother's wedding is the fighting and seeing how miserable he was.  My advice to you, be gracious, don't give your sister a hard time, and remember that it is only one day. You will be sisters for life. You aren't a burden. Embrace your position and do what you can to make it a special day. Being there is important - not the title that you have.
2s5cXFTQaa	This is your day you think of you. Trust me they're going to feel so happy to be there for you on this very special day in your life and to share that with you is all they care about. Just make plans to see them and go to lunch for however long they are there.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	the only person i need at me and my wifes civil wedding is me.|`|VFVdrDBQaa	Etiquette dictates that everyone is offered the same accomidations.  The wedding party is not supposed to have preferential treatment when it comes to boarding/housing.    I understand there wouldn't be room but you only HAVE to stay one night at the hotel before switching hotels.  I would find a hotel as close to your chapel or banquet hall for everyone and after the ceremony there are no "rules" as to where you and your new spouse run off to.  Or your future spouse and yourself could stay at the Beach front hotel and everyone else could stay at another hotel.  Congratulations and have a great time.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Yes it is perfectly ok.
aDL7xmt6aa	Doesn't matter who's name is on it as long as he's transparent about it.  He who has nothing to hide, hides nothing.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Even if your name is on it, he can still take the money out.  Nothing is a sure thing.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Let me guess:  He is older than you and is mostly/fully supporting you.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	It's his account for HIS children, not yours so even if you are married you have no right to it.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Mixing your accounts is a bad idea, for both of you. And it certainly won't stop lawyers getting their filthy hands on his account. If I was your husband, I'd refuse.    I agree with the guy above me, you sound like a gold digger.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Your concerns are really horrible. Does every decision in your marriage bring up these sorts of feelings in you? Unless you're planning a divorce, you need help to feel more secure. Try therapy.|`|rno6XarMaa	Doesn't sound like you're going to have much luck.  It sounds like he wanted that account to himself, and that's how he intends to keep it.    That said, why do you have to dance around it?  Tell him you are displeased with the situation and while you're at it, ask him how he would feel if you did the same.  Deal with the tension - if you can't tell him how you feel because he makes things uncomfortable, he's got you wound pretty tightly around his finger.  Make things liveable for yourself by discussing it with him while the kids aren't around.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	God said that men have feelings but they don;t think about them as much as women,|`|kLXgrjISaa	Do you put money into this savings account?  If you dont, then really whos money is it?  Id suggest that if he doesn't change his mind about it, you have that right to open your own savings account, with your money in it.  That way, he cant have access to it.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	is the two children in the house his???  if yes then tell him he must also maintain a joint account with you  what ever he puts in that one account must also put in the other account for the younger children for special family vacations  but if he is giving this money for his kids granted you are married to him but he did have children pryor and well if dad dies or something they should get something not just you|`|RKhSRMlZaa	There must be some underlying issues going on here if you are so worried about not getting a portion of that money in the event of a divorce.  Are you even committed to this relationship?  I don't think the savings account is the issue here--you have some serious marital issues if you can't talk to your husband about this without "tensions" and "chauvinism."|`|DTBbQbfLaa	SASSY...wake up...read "The Man" 's responce.  I agree completely.  You have no right...NO RIGHT to that money.  Get over your greedy self and grow up.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	It'll still be community property in case of divorce.  Even if you had a joint account, he would be able ot take all the money out without you knowing about it before it was too late.    You act like you guys are splitting up...|`|encb0jc2aa	selfish *****...so concerned about the law, rather than the love......i bet he has another account, Just to divorce you......|`|Kr09aQJkaa	You're wanting to leave aren't you? You are more bothered by his chauvinistic ways than the savings account aren't you? Not having a voice in the marriage has gotten to you.   I would need a little more info before I could give an opinion on whether or not you should speak up about the account.   Do you ask his opinion often?    edit: Him being a shady person puts a whole new spin on things. Make copies of the bank statements and hide them. When and if you decide to file for divorce you will have proof of the account. In my state any property or money aquired during a marriage becomes community property. Even if he spends every dime from the account he will still owe you and the child a portion of the money. If you believe he is up to something shady and continues to be chauvinistic I would file for divorce as soon as possible. No need to draw out the marriage if he isn't going to change. Third time isn't always a charm. Good luck!|`|aXOyK3uBaa	OK - THAT IS SO PATHETIC AND SELFISH AND GREEDY.  I cannot believe you even asked this question.    ? "but what if we decide to get a divorce"??????????    You're more interested in the savings account that has money in it WHICH YOU DIDN'T EVEN EARN - than concentrating on making sure you DONT get a divorce.    Women like you deserve to be homeless.    Have you NO sense of MORALITY??    .
HGPo06Zyaa	okayy, so boys do that when they talk to me sometimes to.   (not trying to e all cocky or anything ut im like the prep, prettygirl, varisty cheerleader, gymnast, rand name stero type girl)  Sometimes if the boy is real cute and hestutters its cute too.   but honestly if you want to over come it, just act like your talking to one of your friends, and be yourself. If your so worried about what that one girl thinks its gonna be hard to talk to her more and more. If the girl doent like you for you then shes not right for you.   Girls like "me" can be very cocky and self-centered. and only go for the football boys. but there are girls out there like "me" who will talk to any guy and get along with them no matter what.   just relax.|`|EbncM0Qnaa	haha.  well personally i think its cute.  so keep it up,  plus if i like a guy its cause i like his insides,  like his emotions? lol  or im physically attracted.|`|s685etpbaa	how old r u im me|`|bTgF1Azgaa	practice practice practice, thats all i can say, and sometimes if u want to get used to talking to girls find a girl and talk to her but dont look directly @ her @ first, loook @ her nose or something non threatening and try to speak|`|2DivdFqUaa	Well that is sorta of shallow but anyways it happens to everyone i bet those girls are just as nervous a you but you can't let them see that you have to confident!|`|5skL2HJxaa	It is natural to be uncomfortable outside of your comfort zone.  Hot women are intimidating.  Next time this happens, just try to relax, and not be so self conscience about what you are saying or about to say.  Try not to think so much, and let the words come to you and go with it.  After a while, you will become more relaxed and comfortable and be in the zone.  Remember it is a natural thing there isn't anything wrong with you.  Good luck|`|MuKd0RAUaa	Get used to talking to a lot of people. Practice on everyone you meet. Girls are not anything special to get nervous about. Once you've built confidence talking to complete strangers, you'll be able to talk to any girl that comes your way. Believe in yourself.   Good luck.|`|b70DKNLvaa	haha thats cute well you cant youll grow outta it trust me girls think its cute:]]|`|PNLwOIOraa	Youll get over it.|`|jnHs3UXXaa	Stuttering and being nervous is cute, it flatters the person you're trying to talk to. Just calm down and remember everybody gets nervous. Continue to be yourself, never be fake, and somebody who appreciates that person will notice.|`|d7SdhXm3aa	If a girl genuinely likes you, she'll probly think you being nervous around her is cute and will like it.   A lot of girls don't like the guys who try to act all "cool".  Anyways, to answer your question, talk about things that are easy to talk about. Like, movies, tv shows, things where you can say, "oh wasn't it funny when....____ happened?" you know? then, as you talk and stuff, it should be easier to talk about other things or to even as a girl out.|`|AA11309904	Hang around ugly girls.|`|13flyD3paa	hey, everyone gets nervous.  my advice? just be yourself.|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	Its all about confidence. You're putting too much pressure on yourself, yeah they're hot but they're just like any other girl. Try and remember that,just smile say hi and remember to breathe.    Good luck|`|1ye5MDU4aa	Have an attitude of They Owe you, but dont act on it just think it. Like the way you talk to a friend, they better listen and like it or theyre not worth your time.|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	Ok honey . . i am a girl . . i am almost 14 1/2 I.M Me if you need any help...     Iwill help you with tips and how to talk to girls *hot girls*|`|6UCrMzGZaa	Well...im not bg on things like this,but just calm down. Tell yourself that you can do it because if you go up to them thinking your going to act stupid or think you will mess up you will mess up or act stupid. Just act cool,but not like you are too cool. Just be yourself and act like you would if she was one of your friends that's a girl. Hope i helped.|`|k7eIsWj6aa	Girls are just the same its not a practice don't be nervous take a couple deep breaths and don't over think when you talk to them just go up with what ever you want to say. Sometimes girls think its cute when a guy stutters over her you know like being shy! The key is to just relax...Good Luck!

If you want a date to the dance, ask somebody.|`|agTCqkLDaa	I didn't have my FIRST boyfriend (preschool sweetheart aside) until the year I turned 21.    Ask a friend to a dance or get one of your friends to ask a cute boy to ask you!|`|RHOiO24Gaa	You are way to young to have a boyfriend. Why do you need a date for the dance,your only 13 for goodness sack. You should be concentrating on other things like school,dance, something constructive.|`|8s9q4V03aa	ur point|`|JERUmEFzaa	Talk to some of the boys in your class and get to know them. Flirt with them and maybe they will ask you out to be there date. But don`t worry lot`s of people don`t even have boyfriends or  girlfriends. I bet someone in your class probably likes you.|`|M8RtzFQEaa	just be you ...i think of it as jesus doesnt let other boys close to me because he has someone special waiting for me in the near future..|`|SNCe0mkdaa	YOUR 13 DONT WORRY ABOUT IT IM ALMOST 16 AND HAVENT HAD A BF. boyfriends arent that important at your age -_-|`|s4TMc1vqaa	I think you should probally flirt with guys more. Even the ones you dont like. Cause you never know if they have cute friends! And I know how you feel bout the dance...i dont have a date for my scholls 8th grade dance either! But find a guy your interested in, flirt, see if MAYBE he likes you, and ask him if hes going, and(if you go) say OH really? Im going too! And see what he says and ask him if maybe he wants to dance with you(at the dance ask him) to some fun songs!|`|bgMewHIiaa	oh my god!!!your'e having a dance too on friday the 13th??ME TOO!!!!NO WAY!!!:D  here's what you should do:   dress cute (but not slutting)something simple like:  http://mydallaswedding.files.wordpress.c...  put your hair different, if you have it down then put it up and if you have it up put it down with curls...cute!!!^-^  and put on some makeup: NOT TOO MUCH THOUGH!!!D:  trust me....  IF YOU LOOK DIFFERENT, THEY WILL CERTAINLY FIND YOU ATTRATIVE...come on, you're a pretty girl just don't be shy..:)|`|UsJDUm1Haa	uhm ur 13! its fine. and just go with your friends too the dance. its better to go with friends than a date anyway. especially at ur age
Uy8ntukjaa	You vowed to love and cherish your husband through better and worse, sickness and health until death. Thinking about being with another man is a betrayal of those vows.     You need to sit down with your husband and let him know exactly how badly you want another child. That it is getting to be a make or break it issue with you. You may need to consider adopting a child if he is willing.     He does not get to say that it is a no and that's it. That is not the way marriage works. You both need to go see a marriage therapist and get some help with this issue. You're already treading on very dangerous waters.|`|b5ecvoTnaa	well, your husband is your husband. You vowed to stay true to him. Stick with it. Adopt a kid. One that's older if you like.
xeeQ9QkLaa	she's not right for you. move on.|`|VnpAZTCDaa	well there u go shes not a cheat , just a female who likes guys 2 pay attention 2 her , ( but sleep with 1 eye open at all times ) cause now a days hardly anybody have any morals ,also u should sit down & have a heart felt talk about how u feel about her hanging with the guys & as long as u r not being demanding or pushy u should be able 2 tell her 2 tone things down when u r  around when shes hanging with the guys , if she likes u she will listen|`|SJbktLITaa	Maybe she is just not in to you|`|sZePlWTQaa	She may just be flirting.

I get that alot too and sometimes I cannot tell if I am being paranoid that I am being stared at, or checked out and I find myself all weirded out by it and then I get uncomfortable.  I get a lot of guys doing this but none of them ever apparoach me so... I guess I am in the same boat with you on that question.    I wish I could answer it for you but honestly... Guys are weird like that!  More than likely they are looking at you and think you are cute but are too shy or reserved to approach you.  OR they already have a girfriend but are still checking you out anyways... lol yeah guys do that alot! :)|`|E01dYM4zaa	there body scanning you it depends on the age 13-? they'll see if they like your body scary i know but true|`|0MWmGTsgaa	Are these guys eyes not proper?

I actually prefer to do it in the shower.|`|77NzfiVkaa	It's not so bad, I actually enjoy it if it's my idea (kinda feel like it's a chore when he asks me to though) but yes you can get STDs in your mouth if he is infected with something.

Its salty and you can get some sort of STD OR HIV if you have an open sore in your mouth and he has a disease like an HIV or STDS...|`|FF4J59pMaa	I haven't done that either. If your not comfortable with doing that then don't. He can't force you to do anything. Wait until you are ready. You can contract diseases that way but thats why when you do decide to do that you need to talk about those kind of things. Its hard 2 talk about that but will be better in the end.|`|VyJl1bZ4aa	the answer is simple:    if ur not ready...DONT DO IT!    not rocket science|`|GuA9zI3haa	that's one of things that i will NEVER do. i think it's disgusting. if you're not comfortable doing it, then don't let him pressure into doing it. dont ever let someone make you do anything you want to do.|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	You don't have to do anything if you don't want to. if you have braces use that as an excuse. If not just tell him you really like him but you would rather do other things instead of a bj. all guys would love a bj but usually they wont force you to. if he gets pissed at you then you know hes just in it for the pleasure.|`|933ea14a69af46db6f2513213d244ad4aa	Don't do anything that you don't want to. If he really cares about you he will understand and respect your wishes. Besides would he do you first? Probably not. He probably just wants to brag to his friends about getting some head.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i have not, and yes, you can get STD's from his d*ck. seriously.     if you don't want to, you simply don't have to and your bf should respect that. if he doesn't, he's not a bf worth having.|`|3m4YrL8qaa	no i havent  BUTTTT if you're not comfortable with it DON'T DO IT!  and if he says please I love you, etc... then tell him to shut the f-u-c-k up and go away|`|AhEZdxXtaa	Well the answer is yes, you can get STDs from that. You shouldn't do it if your not comfortable and you shouldn't let ur bf pressure u into doing it. If he respects u and really likes u then he will understand. I feel the exact same way so just so u know ur not the only one out there!|`|NOhaRLNFaa	If you're not comfortable, don't let him do that. Plain and simple. :)  If the only reason you don't want to give him oral is because it's 'dirty', then remember that condoms are made for more than one reason. They have some flavored like strawberry and other things just for this purpose, so I've heard. But once again, don't do it if you feel uncomfortable.  I never have either, and I know exactly how you feel. I'm just waiting.  Hope this helps!    *smile4me* :)|`|L4QhCMcSaa	ive done it....  && i seriously  regret it DONT DO IT  if he really likes you  he would listen to wat  you think and he would  care of how you comfortable you   are.    i regret it :(    && its not gross its just that  if you dont feel comfortable  [like i did] he shouldnt  pressure you in doing it!    && the down part if you want  it feels good.  but i wouldnt gave given my body the  way I did :(|`|CAOisulkaa	if u have already kissed him on the lips, then sucking his dick get you any more contaimnated than you already are.|`|ZxCK2vi9aa	Don't do it if you don't want to. It's that simple.    I have given my fiance a ******* before, and I don't think it's that bad. I actually enjoy seeing him get off...     If he doesn't have any STD's, then you should be fine, but you want to make 100% sure that he doesn't if you do decide to give him one.|`|PNLwOIOraa	If you dont wanna do it then dont. I havent done it before but if you think you might wanna try it tell him you want him to shower first. If he wants it he will do it without being offended. You mouth wont get   "contaminated" unless he has like a STD or something. Dont do anything YOU dont want to do thought!|`|b70DKNLvaa	haha same here i have befeore no it doesnt get contamitated its not that bad ive never had a guy go down on me but i guess im gonna let him you never know till you try|`|sZePlWTQaa	If you're not comfortable then tell him.

But many people say you get the taste of "URINE"  .... & Like the guy gets .. white stuff out on you .. so dont do it .. o.O .. Bad experience youll regret t|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	if your not comfortable and dont want to do it then say no!! dont let him pressure you into it   if he says he loves you to get you to do it thats just a line guys use to get you to give in if he has to use that to get you to do it he doesnt mean it  do your self a favor and show respect to yourself and get him to show you some too!!  if hes not clean you for sure dont want that in your mouth!! you probably wont get contaminated.. but its somthing that for me doesnt do anything for me i dont like doing it so i dont if he has an std or infection  you could get that its nearly impossible to know if he has one so condoms are nessesary!! even though you cant get pregnant by giving him a b. j. unless he c m s on you down there|`|E01dYM4zaa	that is so sick how old are you anyway if your 13-15 thats sick and nasty don't|`|RIRyRNEeaa	Dont do it... its yuck! Hehe. And if you do, make him shower and shave first!|`|BrfWjPGNaa	first of all - don't do ANYTHING you're not comfortable with.  EVER.    that being said, it's a very common thing to do between two people who are sexually active.  if you have hygiene concerns, then make sure you both shower beforehand.    also, it IS possible, but very rare, to contract a disease from oral sex unless you have an active STD or open sores on your mouth.  if either is the case, you should go see a doctor first.  one way to protect yourself is to use oral contraception, which should be used anyways in order to prevent the spread or contraction of diseases.|`|BWrtmsE1aa	Don't do anything you're uncomfortable with and don't let your BF pressure you into doing anything you don't want to do. You'll know in your own good time when it's right for you to do something like this.|`|13flyD3paa	dont do it!!! ur not ready, and he should respect your decision if he truly likes you.|`|tN6JA7IQaa	If you're not comfortable, don't do it. Really. You'll end up regretting it. If he really likes you, he won't mind and will wait for you.|`|oiJizhJxaa	You should have limits in the physical part of your relationship.  Your boyfriend should respect your uneasiness in doing that. If he can't then hes not right for you.  This sort of thing should be saved for marriage.|`|eT4oBXONaa	well the key is to make you get the point across that you are not comfortable doing that to him...but then set some really sexy dinner up with candles and have a make out session-soon they will forget what you told them and it wont be that big of a deal...and when you are comfortable with all of the bj stuff...then it will be more pleasurable for BOTH OF YOU!!!:)|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Well, you're getting what is called pressured.     This is because this boy thinks more of himself than he does of you. Plus, he wants to be able to tell his friends how he can and does control you.     Think of this: what if he wanted you to shave your head, would you do it? Some girls would, but you won't. And the reason you won't is because you thin better of yourself.    So, at your earliest convenience, you should look around for someone who will cherish you as you are, who will not pressure you for gratuitous sexual activity, who wants to know you for you and not as a sex object.    I know this guy's type. He's a disgusting little worm who is out of touch with his morals, if he ever had any.|`|2vkVQ3F6aa	If he's pressuring you and you think it's gross, obviously don't do it. You'll regret being forced into something you didn't want to do.    And yeah, those things carry diseases and stuff.  Do you really want herpes from sucking some dude's dick that claims is your friend?    And no, it's not gross, but that's even more personal and intimate than regular sex.  Oral sex involves your mouth and tongue and their body parts that pee.  Think about it.|`|j2i4tkqIaa	Well.  If it were you I would NOT allow him to touch you like that.  If he has ANY respect for you he would pick up on your feelings and know how far you are ready to go.  If you really feel that uncomfortable, maybe it is time to break up.  Sorry to say.|`|rd7IgIQ7aa	GIVE HIM A BALL JOB. (KICK IN DA BALLZ!) WHAT A SICKO! DONT DO IT. TELL HIM TO RESPECT YOU! AND IF HE DOESNT THEN AT LEAST RESPECT URSELF.|`|AA11307859	DOOONNNTTT DOOO ITTT!!!!!!! Say no!!  He's a pig!  It will be nasty for you!  He will tell all his friends what you did to him, and everyone will call you a slut...rumors will happen and your'e reputation will be a bad one!  Don't do it!  Dump him and get a new boyfriend!|`|5IU9rJBHaa	dont do it if you dont wana and if he makes you then thats not good cuz he will even try to get you ............... and have sex with u          good luck|`|oCUOordVaa	you have to be comfortable with it. it's awesome to be able to give him that kind of pleasure, but you have to enjoy it too and you won't be able to if you aren't comfortable ... and the same thing goes with the other way around ... and yes you can get an std from oral but not if neither of you have one to begin with so ..|`|GWr7MQkpaa	Remember that HIV is an STD, and it can be contracted through oral sex. A lot of the time, when people think STD, they think herpes or whatever, and it doesn't seem as serious, but HIV will kill you.  If you're really into this guy, and at some later date you feel comfortable enough to go for it, ask him to have an HIV test and share the results with you. If he respects you, he'll do what he can to keep you safe.|`|f0623a9c89c5a91152e260fcedca706eaa	Oral Sex Increases Risk of Throat Cancer-    http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...    someone that truly loves you will not pressure you to do something you're not comfortable doing!

P.S:If anyone wants to help me answer my last question please.|`|V2IGDBHIaa	Try to include her into your conversation next time. Girls probably stare when they have a crush on you or find you attractive, or there is something wrong (but you've already crossed that one out, so only the first two options). Or you could just start a conversation with her the next time you see her. Just don't say anything about the stares or you might embarrass her.|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	she is probably interested in you    and wants you to make a move|`|EKHf4Muyaa	Well, my suggestion would be to ask her if she got the same problem on a home-work question for starters.

P.s: Shoes arent the only thing girls think about..like that "Beehive Ineferno" guy said...some of us have deeper minds than that.|`|DTUnm6Lsaa	Haha may e just like you think that she thinks that you are looking at her you think she is looking at you but she's really not LOL|`|tN6JA7IQaa	Maybe she doesn't like you yet, but she definitely sounds like she's interested in you.

Uy8ntukjaa	You are very young and I wouldn't feel pressured to get married or engaged at this point in your life. Some people feel ready at 17 or 18 and they decide to take the plunge. More power to them. The odds are against teenage marriages though, much higher divorce rate. It's not about going with the crowd, it's about finding what works for you. You'll get engaged when you're ready, doing it sooner is just plain silly.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	not you are not wrong and dont take it personal...most people just read questions quick and assume its for you...its happened to me too as i sometimes post questions for my friends...dont worry about it...its not like its going on your health records or something like that...    if you want to make it clear just put the deatails on the question...  like "My dads wedding reception" bla bla..and then write the details at the bottom...|`|Rzs7rrbEaa	My god woman you're only 17.

Just because these kids are getting married doesn't mean it will last. The adult world is a lot more complicated than most people your age realize.|`|AA10378447	You are very young; too young to try and commit to something for the rest of your life when you've yet to experience a full life. Don't sweat it.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	you are on target dont get married young  live your life see things  threw others eyes  ie  take a child to disney and see them explore  or a child that has never seen makeup an put it on|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I got engaged at 17 and was on top of the world. My fiance left me a few days after my 18th birthday. Getting engaged in high school isn't all it's cracked up to be. When you graduate and go to college you'll meet new people and find someone who fits into your "grown-up" life, not just the small world you know in high school.    I'm almost 19 and I'm dating a great guy now. I can't believe how happy I am. If we are still together in a year to a year and a half we'll probably be engaged, and I know I'll be ready for it.     It all depends on your maturity level and the maturity level of your partner. That, and love of course.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I think you are very bright and intelligent for realizing that 17 is far too young to be married or engaged. You are right...this time.  ;-D    Your cyber Auntie Tricia thinks you should wait to get engaged until after you graduate college...or at the soonest during your last semester of senior year in college.|`|FVFxE6owaa	No one your age should even be thinking about being engaged or married.  They are going to regret it when they are older.
AA12203284	Don't necessarily give up hope.  But I would say yes to quit trying, so hard anyway.  Most usually the person that we are meant to be with just comes along.  We don't go out trying to hunt them down per say.  When you are not looking, and when you least expect it, that is when they come along.  I know that we all want to be loved and needed by someone.  But take this time to enjoy what you like to do for yourself.  Because in time that special someone will show up when you least expect it.  And you will want to have all the you alone time out of your system, so that you can enjoy all your together time with them and only them.  Good luck!|`|W1sgw7k6aa	keep trying but if not it's up 2 u|`|KEUuLH3zaa	stop worrying about it, just be yourself and have fun...if you meet someone special, awesome, if not just keep doing your thing, but never turn yourself off to the possibility and don't put any unnecessary pressure on yourself. Confidence is not hard to obtain, the only thing preventing you from being confident is yourself think about that.|`|XP36zr63aa	no dont give up, theres someone for everyone! :]|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It's fine to give up on love because you can't actually give up. It's in your dna. It'll come back. So, if right now you need to say to yourself "I'm giving up." and focus on some other part of your life then go ahead. Love will come into greater focus when it's time. It's like saying "I'm going to give up on water." You can do that and when your body needs more it will tell you so.    By the way- of course women want confident and outgoing- what's wrong with that?|`|SZOMVGBRaa	I Hear ya on that one.  I mean I guess there's no "rule" you have to keep doing it. But to hear the way you say it it sounds to me like you want ot find somebody your just tired of not being able to. So in that case I would say juts keep at it man. If you give up that's just it, no more and no less. You stuck in this mental world of did I make the right decision and should I have kept going. I wouldn't want to live with regrets and it sounds like if you stop you would.     Ya its hard, but nothing in life comes easy, you need to pick yourself up and get back at it. Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.  Its ok whatever you decide but I think that your not the Type of person who is gonna let a Little thing like love run your *** over.     The reason the older women like you is because they have been threw the asshole of the world and realize they need the "good guy" but there's plenty of women out in the world today who are single looking for that same guy. You know what your problem is ? Your not getting a big enough sample of the available Lady's. There's this book I read once that said if you asked 100 women every day to have sex randomly, one would say yes. So if all your looking for is a date, I think your odds should be much better. Just don't ever stop trying. Good Luck to you, hope your get want you want outta life.|`|djhCah5Maa	I know how you feel.  Sometimes when you stop looking, then you find the right person.  Have you tried E Harmony or Match.com?  It is ok to be alone too. If it makes you happy, then that is fine.  Older men only seem to like me.  They say I look like a baby.  I would rather be alone.  Try just having friends for a while and see what happens.  You don't necessarily have to have a girlfriend, but try not to be alone all the time.  Social interaction is good sometimes too.  I can't stand to be alone with my thoughts all the time.  It drives me crazy.  I always hear that you can meet people at church.|`|6CUvU9D4aa	have you tried like online dating > ? maybe they can hook you up with someone that fits your personality more... but dont give up. just stop looking so hard. when you sit back and loosen up, maybe get out more and push yourself to become more socially aware, you might meet someone special.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	So don't, life don't mean you cant be alone..|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	No you shouldnt give up on love trust me you will find your women one day hun just enjoy not being in love right now because love and cause alot of stuff and you just need to live your life day by day|`|M8RtzFQEaa	yes u r allowed to do wat u want...but u shouldnt there is an old saying that states there is that special somebody for everybody|`|jnHs3UXXaa	I think it's fine for you to take a break for awhile. I think the whole nice and other combinations don't work thing is wrong. You just haven't met the right person yet. Relax and take some time away from it. Don't think about women for a few months and then see how you feel. If you're still not that into it, take a few more. Just give yourself a break from stressing about it and worrying and you just might find somebody because you'll be happier and more confident.|`|2vkVQ3F6aa	In this day and age, you're cutting ALOT of women out of your dating pool by refusing to date women with kids.  Plenty of men have different kids by different mothers, and are not looking for a replacement parent.  Most single moms are accustomed to taking care of their own kids and just want an adult to have a relationship with NOT "a new daddy" for their kids.    If your social skills aren't honed, what are you waiting for?  Be a confident, self-assured person who has fun & doesn't depend on others for happiness, and people will be attracted to you.  Low self esteem drives the opposite sex away.    As for benig turned down, think of it as a job.  You don't get most of the jobs you apply for, which is why you have to place so many.  Asking more women out will increase your chances.  Asking someone out once every 12 months aren't very good odds.|`|dkeenfD1aa	You say you are cerebral. Start hanging out where you can meet some gals who are on your level. Like take a college course for the fun of it or join a club that caters to the kind of interests you have. You have to go where she is if you want to meet her. Right? Guys sometimes think they are going to meet miss right in a bar or just by luck and that really is pushing your luck. I hope you meet that special someone soon. You sound like a good guy.|`|3hjpUzO0aa	nooo!!! never give up!!!|`|0MZChtWqaa	dont give up on love man giving up on love is like giving up on life theres some body for everybody you can get any girl to like you just put your mind to it|`|xPGcUWnbaa	stop being so shy. i promise you there are a few women out there that will really like you and maybe even fall in love with you . date more women . even if you aren't attracted to them at first . if it is meant to be you will became very attracted to her and she will become attracted to u to.

aDL7xmt6aa	In all that you spew above the only truthful statement was "I am very confused at the moment".  Not a good condition to be making life changing choices. Especially when your choices affect others.|`|2dke6ChJaa	yes it is|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	What you're feeling is not wrong, it's very natural, but so is what your husband is feeling.     I think you need to sort out this issue with your husband. Complicating things by having an affair with another man is not going to solve the problem.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	I think you're feeling lonely because you work nights and don't get to spend much time with your husband. The loneliness is why the male co-worker is appealing to you and is also why the baby is appealing to you. You need to find a way to spend more time with your husband. Maybe you need to get a day job so you can see your husband at night.|`|DTBbQbfLaa	listen to me....the GRASS IS NOT GREENER on the other side...trust me on this one.  talk to your husband...tell him how you feel...tell him you will pick up the kids from school!|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You have 5 kids and you are married and you want to make a baby with a friend? You need a spanking and a head shrink.|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	It not wrong for you to feel like that but it is wrong to have more babies when clearly he doesn't want anymore . It is a  2 party  decision.|`|zkTx6iOIaa	idont really know alot about that but if i was u i would sitt down and think about it then get ur husband and tell him how u feel and if he doesnt listen keep tryin|`|JWa78QVoaa	it's called counseling, get to it!|`|apufwtUAaa	i think you should tell your husband about this fellow at work, and tell him what your feeling towards him and why, maybe he will then see how much you want another baby.    and if he dosent want to look like the grandad he should start working out. haha, its a win win situation|`|2l3udVpLaa	that's difficult.......you should try to explain your husband you want to have just one child as you don't have any (you can use donor).....and you don't want to lose this important thing in woman life.....he should mature to understand your need....if he's silent you know what you should do......every year you're losing your change... don't try for collegue as it will make more complicate.... keep my fingers crossed|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Wow.  I just deleted my whole answer after seeing your additional details.     Well, since you made the huge mistake of getting married when you were 20, this is what happens.  He is obviously lazy, irresponsible, and a myriad of other things.  I would NEVER put up with that.  Not to say that you should deny your vows (I don't really understand what you means by "we did not use those vows as he used them with his first wife") but you need to make a decision here.  Was he like this when you got married?  Then you knew what you were getting into 8 years ago.      You need to make a choice here.  And I think you know what it is.  But perhaps you should talk to a counselor before you do.|`|dVlLahozaa	Don't cheat and be honest and talk to your husband if it's really a necessity for you then you might have to separate. But do things right.|`|JRfvfLRlaa	Your husband is right. You ALREADY have 5 kids. Get over it and stop overpopulating the world.|`|wAjuh2YZaa	no|`|nOSlg6Zlaa	It's not wrong at all, everyone feels like this in their lifetime.|`|47382e48aef6e87e9665b1861684e79baa	you already have five, and if you still want one adopt one.|`|YceaSLWeaa	If you have 5 kids total then yes it is wrong to feel that way. Atleast you have kids. Some don't.|`|AA10566319	I jsut think its wrong youd give up your husband just to have another child that just seems like no love there and you cant force him to do it just try to comply with him|`|ZdHrWdITaa	To be honest with you, I I understand where you are coming from.  You can love someone until you are blue in the face, but if you are ultimately not happy with the situation (which you clearly are not) then you should really seek other options.  If your husband cannot give you the child that you want, you will resent him forever.  You will also find other faults with your relationship, and in the end it may not work.  There are other people out there that WILL give you what you want....  Good Luck!|`|7hGyFyedaa	it's not wrong to feel that way but it isn't real. you are confusing chemistry with feelings you should have with your husband who don't wnt the same as you. This should have been sorted out before getting married but i guess you know that already so i won't preach, hindsight is after all a wonderful but annoying thing! why don't you try talking to your husband again and make him understand that you want a baby but to be fair you have to get to understand his reasons too. It concerns you both as well as the rest of your children. Is wanting a baby really more important than everything else in your life?|`|QfYhCYUTaa	Yes you are. Get a puppy or something...you already have 5 kids.     And considering cheating because you want a baby is laaaaame.
vvQBkzCtaa	i feel for you,my man and i got together 12 yrs ago,and i had 3 small kids at the time and we now have 3 young kids together. And his life sounds a little like yours,except i felt neglected a time or two,and when i finally opened up to him ,he felt the same way,but for different reasons we both worked on changing those things, a little at a time,and it made all the difference in the world. But before the changes ,we felt like it may not work out for us.This took place about 4 years ago and we are still getting closer.What we realized, is that we didn't feel appreciated,and our love wasn't the same,basically we both were experiencing some of the same feelings,but didn't see that the other was too.And neither of us were looking at the good things about us anymore. Talk to her and start over in a since, remember the things that you use to do for each other that made your relationship in the first place and start to do them again,its worth it and its not always easy,but your relationship can be fixed if you both try.        good luck|`|AhO0Uoppaa	you should be asking your wife this, not us...communication is the only thing i can see your doing wrong|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Mo i think the sad fact is that the day of 'till death us do part' marriages is just about past. People change over the years . A lady i work with walked out of a 18 year marriage last year. She says that one day she was sitting in her lounge on and off watching TV and her hubby was reading his paper and she suddenly thought "i don't love this guy anymore, in fact i don't really like him that much!". So instead of hanging in there for another 18 years she up and left.    Both remain friends and both have found new partners.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	The first guy was a bit harsh, but it's true.  You need to talk to your wife and see what the problem is.  If nothing else it will show her that you're trying.|`|YAWkCPqYaa	Wait until the girls are out the house , then sit with your wife and talk talk talk ,|`|hs793CCxaa	OK, so look at it from HER point of view. Do you think SHE enjoys her day to day life with you?    You are way better than many guys by not going to the pub etc., so that's a terrific start. But do you let her know you appreciate her? Do you tell her you love her? Is there excitement in your marriage?     It sounds like you need to do something quickly - I often tell people here of friends who's marriages were in a rut, who got the e-book at http://www.bringbackthespark.com and it helped them no end. It's only about $30 or $35 and gave them back their marriages and all the love that goes with it. They are all so happy again.    It's easy to forget why you first married or partnered someone - life just comes along and gets the attention your marriage needs. Make your wife number one, and let her know that she is. Good luck.    Edit:    Forget what Mr Grinch said - there is nothing in what you said to indicate an affair.|`|k73IxCHaaa	You have been given some good advice to your question "How does a marriage work". It works when both parties put forth the necessary effort to make it work. But lets be real 1 or 2 children put the strain on any marriage, but 5 kids would put a strain on the strongest marriage out there.    I'm surprised you guys lasted this long, it is apparent that you really don't have time for each other. The daily circus of feeding and taking care of five kids is worse than two full time jobs. Your wife is probably going a little crazy and has no type of release mechanism. At least you get to get out of the house.    I'm not going to give you all types of ways to try and fix this. All I can tell you is that you need to find the time to spend with your wife alone and let her unload. Because if you don't she'll find someone else to unload on.    Good Luck|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	wow  some woman dont know what they have till they loose it|`|Y6UHIhB2aa	Hang in there. Marriages are difficult and we all go through our ups and downs.

I commend you for being open and trying.|`|tNfjre0Laa	DID YOOOU KNOWWWWWWWW        *  Nearly 70% of all married men and 60% of married women have had affairs. Thats two out of every three marriages.        * Every ten to thirteen seconds someone gets divorced.        * 50% of women and 33% of men remain angry for ten years after a divorce.        * Women have more trouble starting new relationships than divorced men do.        * More than 90% of divorces in long-standing marriages involve infidelities some time during the marriage.        * More than 50% may be involved in a current affair, yet only 25% cite an affair as an actual reason for divorce.        * 80% of those who divorce during an affair regret the decision.        * Over 75% who marry partners in an affair eventually divorce.        * The divorce rate and ratio of infidelity are much higher among marriage partners in an affair.        * The average affair lasts two to four years.        * If an affair becomes public it is doomed.        * If an affair replaces the marriage, it is subject to the same emotional stresses as the marriage but is twice as likely to fracture.        * An affair prevents binding ties from being formed.

Sooner or later it will suffocate in secrecy.|`|pvabglXhaa	May I suggest that you sit down and talk to your wife about what you are experiencing in your relationship and see where the problems lie for both of you.    If the problems are solvable then both of you need to make an effort so get things back to where they were.      If you feel you need more help then by all means, contact a counsellor who will help you go through the issues objectively    You sound like a very devoted husband and father and that's a really great thing, I'm glad to hear that you feel that way.  The last thing anyone needs is another break up and the both of you becoming divorce statistics.|`|aSjHI5jUaa	you're not doing anything wrong on paper, but we don't know YOU, so no one can tell you as you only know if you piss her off or something, children don't matter, thats not the prob, she is mad with something you have done or are doing...talk to her...|`|agTCqkLDaa	Maybe she feels romantically neglected?    If not, you have a wife who doesn't know how good she has it.    Perhaps take her out for a nice dinner (get a babysitter for your kids or have them spend the night at a friend's house or if the oldest one is mature enough-have her watch them-tell her you'll pay her or buy her something as compensation for her time).|`|3IfBUUH0aa	You're going wrong because your a bit predictable.  It's not your fault - the same thing happened to me.    She always knew I'd be there no matter what, like you I put my social life on hold and did loads of jobs around the house and was probably more interested in how the house looked than she was.    Theres a simple answer:    Be spontaneous.    Ring up a friend and arrange to meet the friend straight after work for a couple of pints.   Don't tell your wife until an hour before your leave work.  She'll be annoyed and it might create tension, but you have to start being a bit more unpredictable.    I don't mean start doing this every night - but every once in a while have your own plan of what your going to do and don't be dictated to by habit.    You've lasted well 10 years is great, but perhaps you need to be a little more 'edgy'    A lot of women (not all) need to feel that things could be a little unsteady from time to time.|`|IfwpibHqaa	communication is the magic in a marriage we all have more downs than ups in a marriage i know cas iv been married for 25 yrs you have to work hard to get through. it does get better.  good luck|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Try to get your wife to go to Relate with you and have some counselling.

Also, you'll be a bit short of privacy. Don't give up though. You're a good, faithful man who wants to do right by them all, and your wife knows this. Carry on talking to each other, when the kids are in bed, make a bit of quality time together; a few little romantic gestures would certainly help- kiss her hand over the table, put your arms around her when she's at the sink. Leave little love- notes for her, send texts, bring flowers, chocs, or some little gift. Put a pretty card under her pillow, expressing what you feel for her. It would be great if you could stay together, so keep on working at it....' try a liddle tenderness'!|`|dVlLahozaa	Talk with your wife and try to find a solution together all couples have bad moments and this might be one of those for you.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Mutual respect and love is done by working TOGETHER.

I'm honestly not quite sure if the problem here is really you.  You said you have 5 girls...I'm assuming that your wife is a stay at home Mom will all of the children?  If so, she is probably in a bad rut and feels a little trapped and overwhelmed a lot of times.  Perhaps there is a way to help take the pressure off of her?  Maybe give her a chance to have a couple of days out to do things she would like to do (get her nails done, visit with some friends, go grocery shopping in peace and quiet)?  See if you can offer her this and see if maybe when the pressure lightens on her, if her moods towards you change.    Also it wouldn't hurt to try and plan a night out for the two of you where you can really engage in one-on-one conversation.  At the very least, it will give you a chance for sure to ask her what her deal is.    Good luck.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	It appears youre seeing the forest but not the trees. I sense theres more internal problems here than youre admitting. She may just be over stressed with marriage and family life and cant handle it, like a mid life crisis. Shes starting to look at her life like is this all there is? Youre not doing anything wrong and arent at fault here, but shes got issues she cant deal with in her life and is scared of tomorrow. Professional help will help her thru her problems but I sense she would not go easily. A change of scenery would help but with a family thats not as easy as it sounds too. All you can do is continue being yourself and doing what youre doing and pray for the best. Also if you happen to live where winter really exists, it may just be the seasonable blues so spring could bring change. Unfortunately, with our economy going down hill, theres going to be alot more family problems like this. Good luck

Uy8ntukjaa	You can look into local women's crisis shelters or programs where you might get some support in raising your son. Can your family help you through this? Until he cleans up his act, you are right, he should not be around your child. If he wants to stop there are rehab programs, not being able to stop is a cop-out. Many people quit drugs successfully, he has to want it.|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Take that child and run..the best thing you can do for that child is take him far far away...keep a distance from him and his father until he is clean..(if that's even an option for him) you're a mother now and all you can do is protect that baby with every ounce of energy you can. Just whatever you do NEVER lie to that baby he will never forgive you. Let him grow up knowing what happened. And advise the father that if he wants to have anything to do with his child he needs to get help and follow up on his treatment, before he comes near his kid. That's all you can really do...Good Luck to you and your son and congrats...|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	your son is now and should continue to be your number one priority.  you can not afford to have the b.f. around you, your child or your home. all it takes is one nosey neighbour or concerned friend to call child protection services and you are going to have to prove you are providing a safe and drug free home for him.  you don't want your druggie b.f. around.  look into social services and women's help lines, crisis centers, for some assistance to keep you and your son safe from harm. good luck to you

aDL7xmt6aa	Go 2 Judge Judy|`|RjpPzbBJaa	If she's fighting the divorce, its considered a contested divorce and will require the assistance of a lawyer to get it finalized.   If she's just wishy-washy and not signing then you should file divorce papers, serve them to her and await her response. If she doesn't respond or sign them, then its likely the court will finalize the divorce by default.  You need to contact the clerk and see what your state laws are on this situation because seriously, 4 years is way too long. You need help otherwise you'll do this for another 4 years.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It might take awhile longer, but you can get a non-contested divorce if necessary.

Ml3W4zagaa	The problem with this situation, is you guys are already bestfriends. I really think you should wait, or try to find another a girl. I know that sounds kind of cruel the last part, but there is no bond you can ever break with a bestfriend. If you guys ever broke up, nothing would ever be the same, I can almost assure you that. Friends flirt, it happens, and its healthy for any friendship to show affection. Its your decision, but just think about this. No girlfriend could ever come between a best friend, and I dont know how old are you but not to be a debby downer, how long do you think dating her will last? would you really wanna risk the amazing bond you have now? good luck(; xo|`|DKVqhDx8aa	Wait it out...  If she said that she doesn't want to ruin the friendship then that's the indication that she just wants to be friends.  If you really like her, wait it out and see what happens.  Don't pressure her though because that will just push her away.|`|GOYPKp3Baa	You could probrobally try it see what happens!

uBssj3Znaa	yes because you haven't even experienced life yet.|`|OeD2sJt7aa	Yes.  Very bad!  You really need to live your life a little and discover who you are before you turn into a wife.  Getting married changes EVERYTHING!!!!  There is a lot of good in being married, but there is a lot of stress too.  If you don't know who you are apart from your boyfriend, you will be headed for a major breakdown.  You also need to figure out your post secondary education. You can't live on entry level jobs forever! I don't doubt that you love him, but give yourself more time.|`|joiacDUdaa	I don't think it's "bad" but, I would think very hard and consider what you want to do in life BEFORE you get married.  Do you want to attend school, have a family BOTH think of what YOU want before you involve another person... It's much easier than having to let someone go if you are upfront with your needs and wants.  Ask you bf what he wants as well- just to be certain that you both are on the same page.  Also, if you haven't dated anyone but, each other it might be a good idea to get it out of your system so that in the future there's no "wandering" from either of you.  17 through your early 20's is a time for self exploration and experimenting in the world it's easier not having a relationship to "tend" to.. However, if getting married is something you both feel strongly about and have discussed it.. Then go for it and hopefully things workout for the two you... Also, I would consider living with your current bf BEFORE you get married and see how things go.. You'd be surprised at what you may not know about a future significant other just by living together even if you've been together for 3 years....     * I dated my now husband nearly 12 yrs. before we got married we took a few breaks along the years but, now we are very happily married with two beautiful children... The "breaks" saved our relationship!|`|u1uECuFNaa	YES.  TOO young.  And you started dating at 14?  Too young.

You still have to figure out what you want your life to be. What you want in 6 months probably won't be the same as what you want now. What if you want 2 totally different things and no one is willing to alter or put off or give up what they want? That's no marriage. That's irreconcilable differences. Why not put it off for 5, 10 more years until you are both more on top of things?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	17 is too young.  Three teenaged years do not equal one adult year.  You will not be the same person at 21 as you are now.  Wait.  Marriage is for adults.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	yes, you have know idea who you are yet|`|d7OswsvMaa	yea..2 early..|`|e8bb769602e4d7aa2ac996d5e57e25b3aa	no i dont....if you think youve found your true love then go for it|`|yC7hgBfGaa	it is bad|`|03e31964ea48bacd64475706a14630b1aa	No. That's exactly what me and my fiance are doing.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Nope. If he can take care of your needs... go ahead!|`|qIaBOtltaa	17 is too young to get married. you should go out and meet other guys, before tying the knot, just to make sure he's the only one you will ever want.|`|QSodlfMraa	no if you are in love why not.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Go 2 Singles & Dating.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	yes. you both need to go to college and have steady work before tying the knot. 17 is way too young|`|2huakyaraa	i think you should wait but thatz my opinion.i dnt even think you can get married at 17 can you??|`|NVs2dprzaa	it's not bad...but it may be wise to wait a couple of years....because you may regret it and it may ruin your life because you are so young.|`|gb1hMPcUaa	If you really love each other then waiting wouldn't be a problem. People can be together for 6 years and then decide to break up...so how long you have been dating doesn't have anything to do with it.|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	yes, it's way too early|`|xBgKqAPHaa	yes   you should wait till you areboth older and at least legally allowed to move out and live together  get stable jobs. give yourself 10 years and you should be more ready.|`|3QX9wKEvaa	TRUST ME THERE IS NO NEED TO RUSH. IF YOU LOVE HER...SIMPLE JUST BE WITH HER! YOU DONT NEED TO PROVE ANYTHING BY GETTING MARRIED. GOOD LUCK|`|eulVQ3PQaa	yes it is bad. because your still a teenager and still growing up and doiing a lot of your changing right now. The guy youve been with for 3 years can change also and you guys can grow apart. id say just keep dating and wait til you guys are stable enough to get married and if you guys still have feelings for eachother by the time you get a job and have enough money to raise a family then go for it . but for now just stick to dating, its the same thing cept not as much responsiblity and you have more freedom.|`|oKEkKhd4aa	I think so...you should go to collage and get a nice job first.  Besides, wouldent your parents be a little mad?|`|OWw3LWDCaa	you are still really young, marriage has a lot of responsibilities.  how are you going to support each other?  are you still at school? marriage is not easy.  i got married at 19 and we are now divorced im 47. if i had my time over i would not get married at that age, i would wait until in early 20's,|`|ohpedSQUaa	You are very young and have lots of time to be married.  Go to college and experience life before you move in with him or get married to him.|`|fc6d53d49cee8a18bcc6f405be062a50aa	If you want to get married to this person, you should be willing to wait until you are at least old enough to legally get married without having to answer to your parents. While I do not doubt you love this person, people change a lot in their late high school and college years. If he's willing to wait to get married to you, he's definitely worth more than someone who wants to get married now and get it over with.|`|cB247Azuaa	Listen to Cowboy Junkies' music and they'll explain.|`|dVlLahozaa	too early you really don't know at that age what it means to be in a true relationship you will most likely end in divorce.|`|380f2eaea6445a0c8088bc24364a5491aa	Seventeen is very young to get married.Why the rush ? If  this guy is the right one,if your going to spend the rest of your lives together (and from 17 to when you  die is going to be ...damn that's a long time...) It would be a good idea to wait until  the two of you can support yourselves,have enough money to pay for the basic necessities,and have gotten out of high school.|`|A8QRXHk7aa	too early, well I got married at 20 and she was 18, don't rush.|`|8l61jadRaa	if that is what you want to do then no one can tell you other wise, but from personal experiences 17 is a little young. it doesn't always work like you want it, and sometimes you get your heart broken no matter if you think it won't happen.|`|845400aac246186231a221a901d00121aa	It depends. Myself, I think it's a bad idea... but then you did ask for opinion.    Make sure you've both got stable jobs before you commit to anything. You have to be able to run a home together. And what if you break up? Will you just run back to your parents, or do you have enough cash to get yourself a home by yourself.    Try waiting until you're 21 to get engaged, then get married a year later. By then, you'll really know.    Marrying your high-school sweetheart is really cute, and can work out... but it's still very early and you're very young to be committing yourself so much.|`|nY5shKkBaa	Yes. You will hate this bit. You are to young and inexperienced.  You need to enjoy life or you will find yourself at 25 or 35 asking   what could have been. I have seen it many times. You need to have  fun and forget about marriage for now. If you are with him after 10 more  years get married. Chances are you wont though.|`|PvsXr9E6aa	17 is way too young,talking with experience here! i met my husband at 16 and now about to be separated, go to college, figure out you first!|`|dncQxSS9aa	you may have been with your bf for three years but you aren't even out of high school yet so you don't know the pressures of a world without school and parents.  you haven't lived with him for three years nor do you know exactly what you want in life.  you absolutly can be in love with him i can definatly say that and you might think he's all you want in life but you don't know yet.  take some time, your still young with a whole life ahead of you to decide what exactly you want.  wait a few years.  if he doesn't understand he probably doesn't love and respect you like a future husband would.|`|8OsPJ3lYaa	no it's not bad as long as you are willing to accept the reality of living together...it's not always so nice and fairy tale-like...you fight a lot at first. so just be realistic. by the way you're opening up a can of worms asking this question on yahoo answers, especially being that these people hardly know the specifics of your relationship and just stereotype based on statistics. a lot of couples get divorced nowadays because they aren't willing to put in the effort to work it out, arent willing to go to counseling, and think that once there's one problem it's all going to go to **** and oh well, might as well just throw in the towel, there are plenty of other options. if youre this way then don't get married, end of story.        EDIT: another huge reason for divorce nowadays is unrealistic expectations. like i said don't always expect it to be sunshine and rainbows and flowers and fairy tales. it's just not realistic. wow i already figured this out! ahhaha statistics don't mean ****
R5mmX9Woaa	Well I don't know if this counts or not, but when I had my first boyfriend(a couple grades after elementary school was over) we went on a field trip to the movies with our class. He was sitting next to me. He fell asleep before the movie started.|`|qYPWKv6Faa	no|`|eT4oBXONaa	no but maybe the guy is "special"?|`|AU3HVTToaa	no|`|AA12115728	Bad dates happen.  Dating is like shopping.  Sometimes you get a great sale, and everything you buy looks really great on you.  Some stuff has to be returned.  Some stores suck. If whatever went wrong on the date wasn't anybody's fault, then try again.  If the reason the date went wrong was because the guy's behavior was unacceptable then drop him like he's hot and move on.  Don't accept crappy "merchandise."|`|aQkbl3UNaa	no can't say i have|`|RrmeJqWLaa	Oh yeah. Its totally normal. Its just a sign that its not meant to be. no big deal.|`|SJbktLITaa	Yep this guy that I went out on a date with was absolutely gorgeous but is breath smelled soooo bad OMG. I thought i was sitting near garbage the whole time. So your not alone. I feel your pain.
FU5z9yWuaa	believe .. coz to be honest love can happen anywhere nd fate will hit u wer ever u go if its meant to be then it will be and u have nothing to lose if u really like her then just try it out if it really doesnt work just be friends but if ur frienship is ruined u said u might not even see her ...just to let u no my fianc and i will be gettin married soon and guess what i only see her once a year or twice if am lucky coz she lives half way across the globe and we've been together 2 years :)|`|oldKepHXaa	Have you seen her on cam? Because sometimes who you see isn't who you get. And who knows maybe she could be the one just keep talking to her to find out....but what if shes really a male child molester....|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i was the same way...until my best friend started dating her b/f of a year. he lives in upstate NY and she's going to college in Boston. they've been dating a year now.     if you really want to, you can make it work.|`|t5N92Xnaaa	okay dude, maybe you should go for it and TRY to meet. Who knows, she could be the one...     peace out... :P|`|2DivdFqUaa	Maybe you love her because you think she's your dream girl the one that will always love you no matter what but there's no reason that you guys can't be more than friends who know you might get LUCKY!|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Just take it slow. Continue to chat/date and whats for you will come around when the time is right. Yes long distance relatioships can work if both are honest, communicate several times during the day/nite and try to see each other at least once a month.Keeping in mind that you are in a relationship and avoid situations that my make you forget that because the other person is not there. Live and behave like you are in a relationship and demand the same from the other person. Like me and my "fiance" did. Good Luck!!
uBssj3Znaa	sounds like you are freaking out over nothing, especially if you don't get to see your dad that often. He comments on your body probably because you have changed so much since you last seen him and he asks you questions because you are his daughter and he wants to be a part of your life.|`|PUXmTrnMaa	You should talk to your mother about it. DO NOT confront him without her knowing about it first.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Yea that's really odd.  I wouldn't ever be around him alone.     Tell your mom about this!  She will be there for you, and she needs to know.|`|JwqPNs4Qaa	It would be very smart to talk to ur mom about this.|`|MpKU6BPgaa	tell an adult or your mom. it is very important he doesn't touch you or hurt you. if you feel hes taking it too far tell him how you feel and dont let him do anything you don't want to do to you|`|htWw0OlCaa	I don't think that is normal behavior that a father should be showing towards his daughter. I would be weirded out too.|`|QfYhCYUTaa	Nooo...you're dad's a creep. Tell him you're uncomfortable with the way he's acting.|`|WkDbNmIuaa	tell ur mom about this    cuz what he is doing is NOT right!!|`|PX7F84Ghaa	Hello...Im Gene, Im 41 years old and I have a 20 yr old daughter that I love very much, and i would never do anything to harm or take advantage of that trust between a father and a daughter...I believe your father might be trying to make a move on you, and take advantage of you, not as a daughter, but as a man...The first thing you need to do is confront your father and tell him the way you feel and you are very uncomfortable with the things he says and does. Then I would absolutely tell your mother, what you are seeing and whats happening, if your mother and you are very close, then she should would know what further actions to take against your father. As much as it hurts, because he is still your father, don't visit him alone, always have someone with you, brother, or relative..if everything fails and your mother ignores the warning signs you are telling her, then have a confidential meeting with your school counselor or principal, and they will definitely help you...Im sorry I don't have any use for people like that...|`|mt68kvWwaa	idk.  it may be that since he hardly sees you he may simply go overboard with his emotional expression. If he saw you everyday for the past two years he probably wouldn't react the same way to your development as a woman.  I would show your mother your question because seeing something written has more concrete an effect than hearing it.|`|waiW4Qvgaa	well i don't know why he is asking you about those parts first of all.  But when he kissed you good night who cares! I mean my parents kiss me goodnight? It's normal. And he told you "that's how you kiss boys?" probally because hes just curios about your life .  Im not sure?  But hope evreything turns out fine!  Good luck!  C: Kim|`|OE8r1VtRaa	you need to tell someone. your mum or the police.
AA10168889	Be grateful you're not married to him.   You now must choose.  Stay with him and make the best of it or leave him and create new possibilities.|`|dVlLahozaa	OMG its not that important break -up and move on.|`|MTbsjKuKaa	I would take the big step and end it. you have to think about  1. True you will be lonely at first but isnt it better to be lonely for a little while then unhappy forever|`|NctuEmFKaa	Its hard, but you can make other friends.  Just like you can find a new man,  if you are truly not in love with him, talk to him.  You may can rekindle your love, or you may can show him that yall are just better as friends.|`|AA11374342	LOOK, IF YOU ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM, WHY WOULD YOU STAY? I KNOW IT WILL BE HARD, BUT IT'S NOT WORTH IT. AFTER SOME TIME, YOU WILL HAVE A NEW LIFE, A NEW BOYFRIEND THAT YOU CAN BE IN LOVE WITH, & BE HAPPIER. DON'T CUT YOURSELF SHORT, YOU ARE STRONGER & SMARTER THAN THAT!!! GOOD LUCK!!|`|4HoVVCenaa	Regain or develop new friendships and then leave. He may have deliberately isolated you to make you dependent on him. This is a subtle but clear form of domination by a controlling personality. You will know if he tries to not let you have an outside life. You may have to take the cold shower and leave without any support. What about relatives. Are you isolated from them too? You could even visit a battered woman's shelter and discover this is what abusers often do first: isolate their partner.|`|96HWpdkFaa	You better make sure your really not in love with him before you leave..or you will deeply regret it. If you don't love him it's not fair to stay in a relationship with him. Try meeting friends somewhere and try talking to old ones.     MAKE SURE YOUR NOT JUST CONFUSED!|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Go 2 Singles & Dating.|`|S852p6SXaa	if you dont want to be with him anymore, then you should tell him. why have you stayed with him for four years if you knew you didn't love him? thats 4 years of your time wasted and his time as well. Dont stay with him because you dont want to feel lonely, if you had friends before you'll make new ones plus like you said you want to get out of this relationship which means you want to be on your own for a while. So just be honest with yourself and him.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	You are in the drivers seat. Get back in touch with the friends of old and regain that old bond. You will soon be free. You dont have to tell him that you want him to find someone else who will love him. Just let him know you care for him but the feelings that come from love are not present.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You need to rebuild your friendship base, as it was a huge mistake to let youself become so isolated. That is lesson  1 you have already learned, right?
Uy8ntukjaa	You can always bring passion back into a relationship with a little romance. Do special things for him. Recreate your first date, write him a poem, or make a pretty card for him. Sit together and talk about the things that first made you fall in love. Act out your sexual fantasies. Just always try new things and talk. Yes the butterflies are fun but it's the long lasting relationships that hotly smolder beneath the coals. There is nothing more amazing than crawling into bed and snuggling up next to a person who loves you as much as you love them.|`|ZOakpNy7aa	This may sound stupid,But I had been married 16 years and 7 kids when we went through this.All of a sudden I was sitting there one morning drinking my coffee and looked across the table at my husband and relized that we have been in the kitchen together for 2 hours and the only thing said was "do you want more coffee?' What had happened to the passing look the little wink that would make me smile and blush. Why didnt we flirt anymore. How did we let ourselves get so compfortable that we are here in the same room but lonely. So I stared at him untill he could feel my eyes and he had to look when he did I simpley winked. He tilted hs head in confussion then there it was a smile that smile he said "hey you whats up and we laughed." then we went upstairs and it was like the first time.After that we made sure to notice eachother. a simple hand across the back when walking past the chair.A wink, a kiss on the check when walking past, It dosent have to be any long romantic outing just letting eachother know your still my man your still my gal. It worked. Then a few years later he got a secratary that I guess flirted more. But by this time I  I was going through menapause and he had put on 40 pounds let himself go and his bodily fuctions were no longer making our sons laugh and our daughters screech in disgust.I drove him to his 30 year old and handed her his container for his dentures. As I walked away I said its not always a wink you know? sometimes he falls asleep over his morning coffee. He just sleeps with one eye open.The kids still tell that one and we laugh. but I still remember the day that we rekindled the love and it was real good luck.|`|wNY3P6jEaa	well u should do all the things that u did that he loved in u and 2 get the sparks up wear something sexy like http://www.pamperedpassions.com/sexy_lin...|`|at1Vev9Gaa	I believe that arguing will make each of you stronger and it will teach both of you that you know how to handle eachother when times get tough. You just have to always comminicate and to always do whats right in the best of situations. You want sparks?? You both have to be willing to change. Trust me I know from experience =) I hope it works out!
PDmKvl3zaa	Oh yeah. I come from a mexican family. Spanking to us is like when white people give their kids a timeout. Its not big deal. It happens whenever i misbehave|`|HXfxVe9uaa	Yeah I got my *** beat a lot....for doing stupid ****!! LOL like I do today :) So I guess it didn't work|`|mMBzpldbaa	i've been spanked twice. once when i was seven (don't remember what it was for) and once i was hit for getting into some bad **** as a young teenager. i hit the parent back... you can't lay hands on your child without expecting them to lay hands on you.

But if you love it, go for it!!    good luck!|`|KDD3OfrUaa	i like itt ! (:  its really prettyy !  and by the way i havent even heard of Blue Nile so im not going to give you any advice about that .

I mean it is your engagement ring and you want it to be perfect.|`|Z550EVPgaa	well its a piece of heaven go for it|`|0NmMLdysaa	it nice but original u deserve better than that so No|`|sbvbYatQaa	I don't even like Jewelery and I think that's a beautiful ring.    http://www.resellerratings.com/store/Blu...    Here you can find the ratings and read reviews on stores. Blue Nile doesn't have ratings but has 12 reviews. They seem fine to me, but check out their reviews and determine that for yourself.    Congratulations!!!|`|3cGRm16Eaa	four words   B-E-A-UTIFUL  and yes blue nile is a good place to order from.|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	The ring looks very beautiful; and yes, Blue Nile is a good place to order that ring :)|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I think its beautiful and I have heard nothing but good about Blue Nile. For a .59 carat diamond that is a fantastic price. Go for it!!!|`|tXh84hzSaa	Very pretty, but I do recommend finding a similar one and trying it on. I've seen some like this at Kay's and other jewelers. You may find it doesn't look the same on you finger. A friend of mine picked her's out online, then when she tried it on she hated it! Its a big investment and something you'll be wearing forever, so you want to be sure.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i think that YOUR the one who is going to be wearing the ring, not me, so your the one who should be happy about it.    however, since you did ask for my two cents, it is very pretty, but im not entirely crazy about how the stones down the side are set. they seem too far in if that makes any kind of sense.    as for bluenile.com....ordering important jewlery from websites makes me nervous.  if you buy it from a store it is MUCH easier to just go in if a stone falls out or you need it cleaned, plus its much easier to talk to an actual person about it....i dont know anything about bluenile.com specificly, i just dont feel comfy ordering important jewlery off a website|`|FtBHXQvHaa	Congratulations are in order.The ring you picked is very beautiful. bulenile.com is cool. have a wonderful and joyous life together.|`|M6QBeLc8aa	the 3rd is so beautiful !!  and yes. blue nile is great (:|`|8j7FCEOraa	Doesn't matter what I think    It's your engagement ring. Your the only one going to wearing it.    I actually think it's kind of funny your the one even picking it out. I always told my husband I could less what the thing looked like or how expensive it is, as long as he asked me to be his wife.|`|hkzGYQD4aa	That ring is beautiful! I love the diamonds around the band =]    I don't know anything about Blue Nile, but here are some reviews of it and it looks like it is pretty mixed:  http://shopping.yahoo.com/merchrating/us...|`|AA10378447	Not my taste, but if you like it, love it.    Blue Nile is legit. They have guarantees, just read everything closely before you buy.

And I've never heard of Blue Nile, so I would definately check it out before ordering. :)|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	like it|`|fR2Geezcaa	The ring is gorgeous!     I looked around at reviews of Blue Nile and could not find anything negative. They seem to be a reputable company, just make sure you review their return policy.     My best advice is to stop in at a local jeweler with the diamond clarification info to see if the price is right.|`|zGtELDrnaa	it's beautiful!|`|xreWOKBYaa	Baby you can do better then that! ;)      Don't settle for less than 3 Carats!|`|AA10227142	Gorgeous and yes x|`|FwBCTJj8aa	Yes Blue Nile is very relible!  and i loved the ring!!!!|`|KKGt03xlaa	my dream engagement ring is a 1ct soliatre diamond - perfect clarity, perfect colour, in a plantimum band.  round cut     the ring on the picture is ok|`|1kSRPadaaa	it is very nice, it is not what i would pick but then we all have differnet tastes!|`|dByIPgJXaa	I think it's gorgeous :D|`|cFqu0LLHaa	i like it  but it depends on how it looks on u|`|Gl5nWoeSaa	it looks nice...i wouldnt buy from there, when it comes to buying jewelery stick to a place with a known name just so you dont risk getting scammed|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	That is gorgeous! I love it. It's absolutely beautiful!  I don't know about Blue Nile, though. You might want to ask a seperate question!  Good luck, though. God Bless! :)|`|2b654cf95f00bc7187972ef955e56badaa	It looks alright but it's kinda outdated. It's like the popular style few years back then. I wouldn't go for this style now, but if that's your dream ring, then go for it.|`|qaMrAspCaa	why are you buying your own engagement ring? and why are you ordering it?!?! you should go to the store and see the exact diamond you are purchasing. Never buy a ring with the stone already set, you need to go to a place and look at loose diamonds through one of those microscopes so you can see every flaw and have it set in the band you like. As for the ring, it's your everyday, run of the mill ring.  It's not bad, but it's not fab. Sorry, i don't mean to be rude, i'm just giving you my opinion.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	it's nice... not my style but then again not my ring so if this is your dream ring then go for it. on the reviews about bluenile.com don't trust what other people are telling you. to be honest with you bluenile.com is the only online diamond seller i trust. also bluenile.com has a return policy so if its not what you expect then you can return it in a certain amount of time. also to be honest with you, if you have a budget to spend you won't find that ring or that size and quality anywhere else for that price and i guarantee you that. go for it what do you have to lose. bluenile is a very reputable online diamond seller and would not trust elsewhere if i was considering on buying online...|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	Gorgeous.   It's very similar to mine.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	I quite like it, yes :)  I love how the center stone is a soft oval, rather than a round cut.  Also, blue nile is a very reputable online dealer.  Their prices are quite reasonable.  And even if you were to choose your own ring, there's nothing wrong with that.  My guy had me pick my own ring :)|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Its beautifuL~!|`|HVJnQr3Haa	yup good luck :D i wish u all the best|`|IQXnS893aa	that's the best part about getting married ...|`|8DTRylxiaa	Its gorgeous best of luck to you :)
iUzSlmSbaa	Well affairs are things that never last.. they only go on for a certain time.. that's why they are called ''affairs'' if a woman has a relationship with another man then it can be lasting.. but then it would not just be for the sex.. a real relationship has to have 50 % of a physical relationship but there also has to be mutual respect, honesty and trust for this to become a lasting relationship.. otherwise it's infatuation..     Does the woman have a purely sexual relationship with a man. then it's an affair..  that can't last.. that is too little to keep it alive for a long time.. and to make it into a relationship unless someone is only looking for a casual affair...  and for nothing else.. of substance.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Eduard,  Get over it.    You refused to seek help for erectile dysfunction.  You withdrew from her emotionally.  She had an affair.  She broke off the affair.  Have you dealt with your penis problem yet?  If not, prepare to be divorced in the future.    Please stop asking this question over and over again.  If you want a good relationship with your wife, take care of your erectile problem so you can be intimate with her again.|`|bgWfcplBaa	Women tend to be more emotionally tied to their affairs than men do (in general).  Most of my female friends that have had affairs say they are in love with them. I think it is going to be very difficult to have her remove her affections from the guy she is involved with. Having said that, I am not sure if you are the husband or the other man.  Either way, you are basing all of your decisions on what this woman says.  How can you be sure she is telling the truth about her situation since she can lie so easily to her husband that she promised her life to?  Like I said, many of my female friends have had affairs, and the whole basis of both of their relationships is based on a tangle of lies. Kind of hopeless to me, no matter which man you are...the husband or the lover.|`|encb0jc2aa	ask her if you can watch|`|JkvlAVX2aa	It's very unlikely.  Most men and women are sexual beings.  If she cannot be satisfied within a marriage, she is likely to seek satisfaction somewhere else, sooner or later.    If sexless marriage is for you but not for her, the best thing is to get a divorce.  Then, you can find a woman who likes a sexless marriage too.    If both of you do not want to get a divorce, then you better start learning how to share your wife with other men.  It is unfair asking your wife to be sexless all her life simply because she is married to you.|`|TZw9Q7pOaa	She  will leave the lover,  if he isn't giving her sex or emotional support worth staying in the relationship for.   Those were the reasons she cheated in the first place.   The way she sees it, she doesn't need a guy not worth having.  For that she might as well stick with the husband.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	The wife shouldn't be having an affair.  Just say no.|`|dVlLahozaa	She should think about her family and how important it is to stay together. They should also talk about it as a couple and find a solution to increase sex.|`|NctuEmFKaa	Please clarify.  Is your wife having an affair?  Are you trying to find a loop hole to have an affair with a married woman?  HUH?
9044049de30a44bf02cd045c6e508f31aa	i wont say i dont think he does or doesnt cause u can never guess what people think but maybe hes just being a good friend.....but u caught him looking on u in class on several occasions......hmm..maybe he does...|`|6UCrMzGZaa	It is a 50 50 chance. If you guys are real close just ask him about it.|`|Kbgc6x5raa	i think your looking to far into this. i don't think he likes you.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	it's possible that he likes you. however, you have to express to him that he cannot act on his feelings unless he breaks up with his g/f first. if you guys are really tight you can talk about it. but basically he just has to know (and you do too)...NO CHEATING ALLOWED!|`|2DivdFqUaa	He does like you but you shouldn't get together if he has a gf|`|M8RtzFQEaa	u should wait for more signs then that ...maybe hesjust being very friendly(LOL) um u should ask him first..and if he does then go for it
gecqeK6Daa	I think you should explain to your friends that you are feeling like this... if they are true friends they would try to make you feel like part of the group again. I hope this helps :)|`|DKVqhDx8aa	Fighting is not going to solve anything.  If they are really worth it, they'll eventually come around.|`|apufwtUAaa	fight kyle, or just try and get along with him, call a truce.  all you can do really.|`|1PWsr8X4aa	dude, just stick with Harrison. those friends are gone, make new ones. and if you want to stay friends with them, become friends with kyle and then you'll get in the group. Or talk to Rich and Steve about the whole thing  Good luck|`|1ezGeNofaa	Fighting isn't necessary. Just try to get closer to your friends without Kyle, without causing anything. If Kyle confronts you, try to talk it out with him first. Say that the fight thing was a stupid mistake, and ask if you can both just forget the past and start over. If he insists of fighting, try talking one more time, and if it doesn't work, just walk away. Fighting won't help solve anything, honestly.  good luck:)
a0309e3a32a74064ccda5c6a7c7178a0aa	Yes.  Men are jerks from age 18 or 19 to age 35.  After that, a lot of them get divorced, have baggage and are still jerks.  Prior to age 18 or so, they haven't had their hearts totally broken - and they are still sweet.  Then, they realize that women are like buses and they just get on when they want to take a ride.  However, I have met a few really, really nice men.  I'm dating one now that is absolutely golden.|`|96HWpdkFaa	There are alot of assholes out there...I'm happy I found a nice guy...he's a lil dorky..but he treats me with respect...is responsible, has a good job...and that's what matters. I'm happy i married him =)|`|L38M9lrLaa	Guys are jerks....they really suck im engaged and hes still not perfect|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Go 2 Singles & Dating.|`|XJEGTZJqaa	depends on the person|`|MN8MDFzMaa	well that depends if the guys is a weenie or not well if he is worth keeping  he would be nice if he is not well then he is not worth keeping TRUST ME  lol i know|`|uuMCGT9taa	ya ive had guys be so rude then guys be total too sweet.     its just how that guy feels that day i guess. . .    but my bf now is really sweet too me but a total jerk to other people|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	dunno. I don't date.|`|kyaCKtFHaa	i have some good and some bad so i cant honestly say yea or no|`|U9zRe7Oyaa	Depends on the guy, but yeah, most are nice, at least on a first date. you know, they get so nervous. it's cute. and yeah, guys tend to be more insensitive than girls, but it does get sort of annoying when a guy is just over the top nice, as in doing everything for the girl. it makes us feel sort of helpless|`|8DTRylxiaa	95% of the guys ive dated are good decent guys but the other 5% it was just hell. Just be sensitive and actually listen to what she says dont just look down her shirt or at her butt or lips.
lC1VVt96aa	The fact that your Father is in Iraq probably has something to do with your Mother putting too much on your shoulders.  She should really realize that you are trying to complete your education and she needs to cut you a little slack.  If your brother is allowed to continue to shirk responsibility, he will not be able to handle life.  The fact that you flew off the handle is too bad, but forgivable.     Sorry your Mother has pneumonia but since she has been to see her doctor, she will probably be able to control it with medication.|`|GqamX9Dqaa	Mom should be asking your brother to buy the collar, not you. It's his dog, and he has a job. I don't blame you.|`|N8rOFOuDaa	I'm so sorry about your mom, but she shouldn't make you pay for the dog.  He's not your responsibility. Maybe you or your brother should take the dog to the pound or a home for a little bit until your brother gets enough money to take care of the dog himself.|`|y43tzOQlaa	Wow you guys have your hands full. There seems to be 4 people existing under one roof. Your dad can't be there and your mom is trying to hold the family together. The only thing I can suggest is a family meeting, everyone has to pull his and her own weight. There are no short cuts, everyone is trying but not at the same time or same level. Try a meeting, you can't be the only one to live by the rules. Mom just has to not be stubborn and take care of herself, she won't do any one any good if she's in the hospital. Take care, Good luck.|`|6gwqO3ouaa	If I were you I would tell my brother I am getting the dog put away if he doesn't take responsibility for him or just let the neighbor report the dog and try your best to get your mother admitted to the hospital. Pneumonia is very serious people have often lost their lives to it and it shouldn't be taken lightly. Apologize to her for your potty mouth and and express the concern you have for her health. It took my mom a month to recover from pneumonia and it can worsen and it will not be good.|`|pBsFnXMraa	dude, priority 1 is keeping your mother going to the doctor regularly if she refuses to be hospitalized... my father died of pneumonia, untreated it lingers on and continues to get worse... apologize to her for using the f word if it makes you feel better but don't apologize to anyone for being angry that your brother doesn't take responsibility for his dog.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Apologize to mom.  You are all under a great deal of stress with your father being in Iraq.  You don't tell the ages of your brother or sister, but they're not doing their share and mother probably realizes it.  I hope that she'll be feeling healthy soon, she might be avoiding the hospital because she's badly needed at home right now.  Best wishes!
mHZvOhsDaa	hes shy, or doesnt have much to say. not a good topic starter..     mainly im the same way, i talk when spoken to but i used to be really shy, and infact the girl i started to know was through email, cuz i couldnt approach her cuz A, shes really shy and B im shy as well..    he would have told you hes not interested when you asked.. you shouldnt worry about it 2 much.    help me?|`|BJERgbM5aa	I think he's pretty much happy with you contacting him first.  He hangs with you every time you ask right?  Maybe he's a bit shy or maybe he thinks that if he asks first, the he will seem or look needy.  Some guys think like that.  The worry is when you text him and he ignores it.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	cause his friends are more important and he's not ready to comit yet.   i hope this helps|`|T5ztIAZbaa	All guys are not the same.  It's very possible that that is just not his personality.|`|0afWMIoKaa	Guys are different. We dont want to seem like we need to talk you all the time. He is probably at home waiting for you to text him so he can text you back. Does he text back right away? He doesnt text first because he doesnt want to seem like a needy guy.|`|h7W0q7Ivaa	maybe he's shy or waiting for u to text him|`|AA10404719	I think he likes the fact that you are chasing him, or so he thinks. Give it a couple days without texting him and see what happens. I bet he bends and sends you one first.|`|B2Djl6bDaa	Why would he text first if you always do? You've always been the one to initiate it and he probably doesn't feel that he needs to. If you stop now to wait and see if he will IM first, you may be in for a bit of a wait. It will then become a game to see who will break first. Don't get testy and try to wait him out. That alone is sometimes enough to make a guy start to lose interest.
OIJ3JBkSaa	she may feel that she would be overstepping her boundaries by offering to help so if you really and truly want her company then ask her if she'd like to come look at dresses and such with you.  just be prepared for suggestions and opinions that you may not care for and be ready with tactful answers for them!  good luck with it all and happy wedding!!!!|`|IxoazyHUaa	I think it would be nice to ask her for some help, even if it is just some small details for her to take care of.  She probably hasn't offered as she doesn't want to impose.|`|DCXss6Odaa	Ask her!  She will be honest, most women would be happy to be involved.  You will probably be pleasantly surprised! :)  From what you have said there is no negativity there!     Good luck and congratulations!  x|`|tXh84hzSaa	Maybe she just doesn't want to impose. I think inviting her to do something wedding related would probably help to strengthen your relationship and make her happy. Give it a shot, the worst she can do is say no.|`|ebguWgVAaa	Absolutely!  It's a great way to form a bond with her that can last for a lifetime.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Invite your FMIL to lunch and invite - don't demand or expect - her to help you with planning your wedding. And tell her what you told us - your own mother is gone now and you suddenly realized that you could really use the support and the help.    Invite her - however. Don't expect her to volunteer. Don't expect her to just step up to help. Invite her. Ask her nicely and politely if it wouldn't be too inconvenient if she would help you.    And if she declines, then that's ok too. You can always ask her advice every so often anyway.    But you won't get if you don't ask - politely of course.|`|QenW1Ok7aa	I'm very close to my FMIL. It would break her heart if I asked her for help and input planning a wedding now. Because I'm divorced from her son, and she is still very upset that things did not work out.[ He left me BTW, and we get along just fine-but Mama is devastated.]     Theoretically, if your parents divorced, then asked you to help them plan their next wedding to their new spouse, how would you feel?      I'd imagine that your mother in law would find this situation just as akward- You're HER daughter because you were married to HER son-why would she enjoy helping you make decisions on your marriage to a new guy?     If you are friends, and see each other on a regular basis, you should certainly invite her as a guest. But asking her opinion on things such as dresses and flowers and what music to play might hurt her feelings too much for too little benefit.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.    I give your future MIL credit.  She is trying NOT to impose (in my opinion.)      I think it would be really nice of you to ask her to help you select a dress, go to various vendors.  As a mother-in-law myself, I know that I would LOVE to be asked to do those things.  But, those are things that I personally like.    If you DO ask her and she declines, don't be disappointed.  Unfortunately, some women are just not into planning weddings.  But.....YES, I do think it would be a very nice gesture, and I hope she appreciates it and accepts your offer!    Good luck and I hope you have a beautiful wedding!  I just love small weddings...they are my absolute favorite!|`|AA10378447	If you want her help, it would absolutely be apprpriate to ask her. I'm sure she'd be thrilled.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	I think it would be a really nice gesture to ask if she could come lend moral support when you meet with vendors. Mine has been a great help at those times when neither my fiance or mother are available. plus she has so much more practice at this sort of thing than my family!
xeeQ9QkLaa	you haven't even gone out with him and you are already uncomfortable with his lifestyle. don't go out with him, he is not the right guy for you. why torture yourself and even consider dating this guy who obviously already makes you feel insecure just because he's being nice to you? he could just be a really nice guy and have a lot of female friends but that usually is with girls their own age and not younger ones. women's intuition is rarely wrong.|`|KmaXKjuHaa	over....2-3 years means nothing! trust me, when I was dateing I always thought about the age thing and I missed out on some good girls. You should look ahead 2-3 years in your man, more maturity. If your 18, look like a well dressed, mature, hot chick!|`|na9nG47zaa	He might not be aplayer. Lots of girls could just like him. Its how he reacts to these posts on myspace that makes him a player. Like if he responds to these posts in a positive way or sexually hes a player. duh?|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Probably.|`|SJbktLITaa	Are you being kind of stalkerish you mean?|`|xHy7ZjI8aa	okay first off i resent the statement about 18 year olds who like 16 year olds being d-bags. my bf is 18 and i'm 16 and i love it. he's the sweetest guy i've ever met.   anyways, moving on. if he's cute, then the girls are prolly just falling all over him. he's more than likely not into them. if he flirts back on their myspaces, then yeah, you should prolly just let that whole thing go. don't want to start off a relationship with petty jealousies.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	You can't tell if he's a player by just his myspace.  You need to see him act the same way to other girls as he doe to you.  Players will put down the BS lines to all the pretty girls not just a few and he'd brag about it to his guy friends.    I'm not really sure he's a player or not but it really doesn't sound like he is.  The girls on his myspace are the ones crooning over him not the other way around.  Girls tend to be like that with good looking guys especially these days.    It's just a guess (but an educated guess) that he's not a player.  Maybe you should tap that before some other girl does.  First come first serve you know.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|FwBCTJj8aa	ya is defff a playa!|`|sZePlWTQaa	I think he likes you if he came up to you. A lot of times people like to be "cool" on myspace or portray themselves differently online. Hang out and get to know him. Maybe he is a good guy.|`|JD3yWKNGaa	Yeah he probably is a player. They are always the difficult ones to deal with.|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	yep u dealin wit a playa but he is into u|`|d8DqZblcaa	A player is someone who's actually sleeping with a lot of girls and not my-spacing. I don't see a player here.|`|kt774vEraa	Hey, I just think he was a flirt. In order for him to be a player:  A) He needs to date you  B) He needs to cheat on you  C) He needs to date more than one and have sex with all of them and you  D) He needs to have a girlfriend that isn't neither of you!  E) He must not have a clue of what he wants for his love life    Take it from someone who used to be a  player.|`|oYcWRBY0aa	no.im not a playa and i would do the same thing.i will talk to other girls n stuff but iff i love you i will b wit u|`|MdCaGKolaa	your pathetic, this person doesn't like you get over it.    hope this helps.|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	18 year olds that like 16 and 15 year olds are probably douche bags.  I wouldn't trust him.|`|03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	I hate to rain on your parade but a player would have 100+ girls on his myspace page, rather than just 5.  Still, I'd take it slow rather than jump to conclusions.  I'd up the ante, and either just flat out ignore him (to see if he talks to you again) or just plain up ask him out.  Then you can see his reaction.|`|AA10404719	He's a kid, he don't even know what he's doing, playin, probably, but I would find someone else.|`|B2Djl6bDaa	No, but he probably wants to be. I'm really nice to whenever I'm trying to get laid.|`|AA11947508	Doesnt sound like a player, or seem to have many friends at all....8 people on his top? I have like 600 people on my myspace....if the comments say "we should hang out" then they havent hung out.....just have fun and go with the flow, crushes are kool, its not like ur getting married.......
VCRP9efqaa	you're only 13.  dont even worry about it.  the best thing you can do right now is just chill  and just focus on your schooling,  boyfriends can come later=)|`|AA11436717	i cant see ur pic|`|Kbgc6x5raa	your link doesn't work|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	whats a boy "frined"|`|sO2CKU1uaa	LOL maybe not ugly, but.. dumb?

If you cannot appreciate yourself, how can someone else?  At age 13, I would be careful of having boyfriends.  Most boys at that age are pretty immature, and may hurt you.  Good luck|`|Msd9PiRGaa	Neither have I. In fact, I don't even know what a frined is, so you're way ahead of me.|`|cFqu0LLHaa	u cant see the pick and anyway ime too you do not need bf|`|MuKd0RAUaa	That link is not going to work. You need to put it on a image hosting site like imageshack.|`|R3AN5WO0aa	get a link thats gets us to your picture  then well answer your question|`|FF4J59pMaa	Its ok not to have a boyfriend. I am 19 and I have only had one boyfriend and I am not that bad looking. I mean im not like WOW! or anything but everybody has their good points. I get complimented on my eyes and my hair a lot. I choose not to have a boyfriend cause after my first one I don't think I am ready. They bring to much drama. The very first boyfriend I had went out with me dumped me went out with my sister dumped her and then asked me out again. I said no but it still kinda hurt that he dumped me 4 my sister. So yeah just wait awhile. You don't absolutely need a bf. And just because you dont have one doesnt mean you aren't pretty. I tried looking at your pic and it wasn't working.|`|ib00OjJXaa	idk if your ugly or not  you need to upload the pic to a site like Tinypic or Photobucket, then give us the link.    btw your 13 years old. so its common not to have one. you'll get one eventually|`|mHZvOhsDaa	lol your link is from your computer "my computer, harddrive, documents etc.. i.e it isnt on the internet so we cant view it.. but hye dont let that get you down.. going out in middle school is stupid anyway, no 1 does anything just maybe hold hands and sit together at lunch.. BIG DEAL!    wait till your in hs, things change, i have never had a gf, i have rejected 2 because i like them only as a friend, and the ones i have tried i either lost interest or got turned down...  their is no such thing as ugly.. there will always be someone in worse shape than you. so dont worry, you will come across the guy sooner or later, no i dont mean 35, but if it does happen to be that, be happy cause it will be the guy you love not the guy you got 2 say oh yeah i dated him b4.    your asking for a bf for the wrong reasons, just be friendly, talkative, nice and kind, make friends and watch them take your bait :)|`|y075ayrKaa	your only 13...  there is so much more things to do than having a boy friend right now.    you could wait until you like sombody later in high school.|`|IHD5ywLiaa	Ha ha ha..How dumb.|`|zdlS3fgDaa	Just cuz you're 13 and haven't had a boyfriend doesn't mean you're ugly. You don't need to really start worrying until you're 15 or 16 and boyfriendless.  Btw, your picture doesn't work.|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	u should try to upload the picture the rite way first lol|`|G9RIvaJyaa	you're not very bright are you|`|2nMkDyDqaa	bad link lol|`|k7eIsWj6aa	I'm older than you and have never had a boyfriend or even a guy that has crushed on me (that i know of at least) so don't worry everything works out. Love comes when you least expect it!|`|uZTzird4aa	sorry..no link...we can't exactly access pictures from your comuter w/o you giving us a link from the internet...    ps: perhaps you should try taking a comuter class and use spell check (referring to the way you spelled "friend")|`|oFptKbCJaa	there is no pictures. You need to hyperlink|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	hmm, first we cant see those pictures, they are on your file  second, who cares, your only thirteen, i havent had a bf yet either, these right now should be the least of your worries, focus on school and getting good grades  and NEVER think that you are ugly|`|qwVruoJ8aa	Hahahahah you not the smartest person when it comes to putting up pictures on internet|`|ACGm36ZGaa	Can't get to the pic|`|aMgmTN3zaa	I can't see the picture..

I've had several guys ask me out sort of, but I have no intention of dating or having a bf.. I've learned, that they will respect you for that decision.. Trust me.. they really will!   I love my guy friends.. they are better that way, for now..  Wait till you're older.. Just hang out and have fun for now..  You don't need the heartbreak of having a boyfriend..     Trust me, it's so much easier to just be friends.. Especially when you're only 13.. Give it several years! No need to rush into things.. You have your whole life ahead of you!!|`|t5N92Xnaaa	ur a loser... upload the picture first.. its only on your computer... :P   ur stupid.... who cares??   i dont even know why there are like people answering you... okayy, wait im answering you... oops... :S ha ha who cares??  bfs will come and go and who cares?? i said that like 3 times right?? thats so much fun!!! :P so much fun!!! okaay im a little crazy but atleast i can spell FRIEND and dont say frined... !! ha ha u a loser... no offense but u are.. :)|`|plGuYnNDaa	I cant see the pictute but it has nothing to do with what you look like, i mean it could help but you have to get noticed through your personalty..|`|AA12115728	Good thing your pic didn't work.  Don't upload your picture for strangers to view, dear.    Don't worry about not having a boyfriend at 13.  You're extremely young.  Concentrate on school, skills, and a social life (with girls AND boys).  You might find yourself with a boyfriend when you don't obsess on getting one.|`|OJJWNuDdaa	your link does not work|`|VFTXyCEpaa	there isnt any picture ?|`|i5c9EcX8aa	No trust me at that young of an age mostly nobody has had a boyfreind it may not look like that but it has im sure you've been asked out before!|`|BNPvA7rbaa	you shouldnt ask people that and first the picture doesnt come up it doesnt matter what other people think some were out there ther's gonna be that one guy for you kk hope i helped|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	The link to the picture doesn't work...    Chicka, you're only 13. You have tons of time to have a boyfriend!! Just work on being friends with guys now, so that you'll be more comfortable with guys as you get older. And as the guys get to know you, they're more likely to like you...|`|2DivdFqUaa	First of all i'm 14 and i haven't either there's no law that said we're ugly if we don't have boyfriends. No way i personally think i not that appealing either but that hasn't stopped any boys they still say i'm pretty maybe there is that guy who thinks your so beautiful but it's really how you think about yourself. NEVER EVER EVER say your ugly because everyone is beautiful in THEIR own way!!|`|I0NcxTUGaa	it dont work sorry im 13 if i canhelp.|`|6UCrMzGZaa	Even though  cant sse ou pic, i can tell you that you are not ugly. This one girl at my school is real pretty. She is 15 years old and is real pretty and she has never had a bf. plus ugly isnt in my vocab. No one is ugly to me. It is ok, just dont worry about.

5lpEn09faa	my parents divorced when i was 2 mainly because my dad was a total loser, drank constantly and fooled around on my mom behind her back. during the divorce the court ordered my father to have visitation rights so i would see him every major holiday or sometimes during the summer when i was growing up. however i didnt get along with my stepmom who was a total witch that verbally abused me along with my father so i begged my mom not to let me go back to see him. well my father called one day about 11 years ago out of the blue to say he was sorry blah blah blah and that he just wanted me to be happy. i never heard from him since. i am now 22 years old, married and with a son of my own and i am glad that loser isnt in our lives anymore. whats done is done and my father has made no attempts to see how i am doing or anything over the years so screw him. in both our cases it is their loss not ours. just forget about him. out of sight is out of mind really. im sorry to hear that you are going through this and i know what it is like. good luck to you.|`|6bddae3054027d8540fd9bd8cf82276eaa	my parents divorced when i was 4 or so.  i remember it still today.  my mom and i moved across the state, after she met the man who is my step-dad.  i saw my dad once when i was 8 or 10, then once when i was 12.    i myself am married with kids now.  honestly?  i cannot see how my parents could have ever been married since they are totally wrong for each other.  they truly do not like each other.  I am just lucky to exist at all!  i guess that is why they came together - to have me...  holding onto the anger, and resentment did nothing for me but make me miserable, and teach my kids anger.|`|3uRN84P6aa	well,i have a similar problem.  but it is with my mom.i have asked her why she wasn't there my whole life. so the next time you talk to him,be calm. and sort things out.but if he does not answer you...  ask him until he answers you.|`|qZvxmVaCaa	My dad barely talks to me...only on special days or days where he remembers to call me......its like i have no dad at all and it makes me feel really sad and im only 13.....|`|dtZiXpqNaa	Be lucky you still have a dad.|`|ZiSas7Mbaa	hes not a real father figure if he did that to u all you need is the peopel who care about you and are worth our time your birthfyather is anasshole and is not worth your time or energy.|`|EYPY87woaa	Yea, your father IS an ahole.  But that doesn't define who you are or who you will become.  It doesn't mean that anything you did wrong made him not love you, it's just in his nature.  It was in my dad's nature to beat my brothers and cheat on my mom.  I do great in relationships and absolutely love kids.  I have hard feelings for him, but I don't let that effect my day to day life.      Your dad thinks that the only way he will be remembered/noticed is if he leaves a bad impact on someones life.  Don't let his and your past dictate your future.  And don't hold onto it.  Accept what he did, cut off contact, and start a new page in your life.  A fresh, clean new page that he can't get his hands on. Ever.      Try not to tell your kids all about the bad things he did, ignorance is bliss in this case.|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	My Dad left when I was 17, I am 38 now. I think of him occasionally and wonder if he ever regrets not seeing us (or his new grandkids) but I really don't care for him at all.    I once misheard my Mum and thought she had said, 'Your Dad died' and until I realised I had misheard her, I really didn't care at all.|`|N8rOFOuDaa	Your dad is an ahole.    My parents got divorced a few years ago.  I was about 13 and I hardly see him anymore.  Maybe a few times a year I do, but it always hurts to when he's here.  I feel like I don't really know him anymore.  He's changed so much.  I try not to take sides because I still love him and my mom so much.  But my mom hates him for not being around.  And my dad blames her for so much.  It's so unfair.  My mom always says he could be helping out so much more.    Your mom must be really strong to have been able to raise you all by herself all those years.  I'm sure you're an amazing mother now, being the complete opposite of your father, and caring for your kids so much.  They will always love you for that. :]
c9a6e2bf8a29a6984cae9499440a6756aa	No. Being abandoned isn't something you just forgive or forget. It hurts too much.  Trying your best is fine but in some cases it's too little too late.|`|bO2rzfISaa	My daughter is 26 and though she doesn't act out, she is not over being abandoned by her father. You are incorrect in your conclusion. Not everyone is like you. Some girls, especially, are permanently damaged from being left by their fathers. You lack empathy and I think are a bit unkind. BTW, he could have contacted them at any time (telephones, you know)  and he didn't until you encouraged him to. He's a terrible father, imo, and maybe in her opinion, too.    EDIT: You can't make up for abandoning a child. You just pick up when you resume contact. You are making light of this.|`|QfYhCYUTaa	You are cold. Your husband was a drug addict and cheat who abandoned his family for someone else and they are just supposed to "get over it"?
OG4410bdaa	well  if he was bi-sexual then we could still love each other  I'd just have to accept that he would have attraction towards other men  (which shouldn't be too hard for me,  since I'm bi-sexual and he has always supported my attraction towards other women)  however if he was completely and entirely gay  had no attraction to me what-so-ever  then I'd imagine that we would divorce out of mutual understanding  we both have a right to have love and happiness,  if he was unable to return my love for him then it'd only be fair for both of us to go our separate ways  as far as our son goes, well, I hope that we could stay friends for his benefit  lord knows my husband is a good father|`|AA12296351	Yes.  Why would you be with somebody that doesn't have any sexual attraction towards you?  Life is too short and we only have one to live.|`|6aNFkVSkaa	i`d move in with bear probably. i would,nt stay with my wife. if she were gay who knows who she slept with .I don`t know if the other woman slept with other people.too much of a risk.|`|AA10168889	Yes yes yes.|`|ohpedSQUaa	Yes I would.  He wouldn't want to stay with me either, I am sure.  What sense does it make to live with a woman if you are interested in men?|`|nWp27KXuaa	Yes he's probably cheating with a guy or want to cheat with a guy why stay only for you to end up getting hurt...or are you going to wait around for him to leave you to go be with a guy...he's probably using you  to hide the fact that he's gay...i say leave and leave now!!!!|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Ummmmmm. YEA! What a strange question.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Well, if they were bi no.   If they were gay...Yes. Because that means he doesn't find me attractive and can't feel the same way he'd feel towards a man. And I'd be deeply hurt that he married me without telling me. I would have to get a divorce.|`|zprAkP3eaa	Of course i would divorce!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Yes. Contract is null and void.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	It would depend whether she was bi and still enjoyed me.|`|encb0jc2aa	that would depend on if you like to watch or not|`|kyaCKtFHaa	hecks yeah i would be gone i am so afraid to get a disease|`|AA11969451	If I learned my husband was gay I think we should divorce. We both deserve to love and be loved completely.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	I don't know.  I obviously would no longer have the "traditional relationship" with him anymore, but I don't know if I would divorce him.  I love him THAT much.  If he needed me to be able to live without persecution from family and friends, I think I might stay.  But honestly I can't tell you.  I really can't imagine that ever happening--my husband is SO straight.  :)|`|2l3udVpLaa	well....yes as they have own life now....and  I need my life too....|`|NUpZqZLkaa	Yes that would be difficult because I enjoy sex so much!    My current guy has a thing for wearing my lingerie occassionaly which is both funny and wierd, but the sex afterword is fantastic!!|`|dVlLahozaa	Yes. Why would anyone want to be in a relationship like that? Everyone deserves full love and honesty, If he is gay he obviously doesn't love you. he likes men. Move on and find someone who will truly love you.
GBSnBbWiaa	Trust me I know how you feel! She just wants to make you so AH TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BLOW HER UP, kinda way!! Try to let her not see your anger!! Here is what you do! At school when him and her are talking (i'd say when someone else was around so she won't make up something) go up to him and give him a big kiss! and say something like how's that or oh my bad were you going out? I know when you read this you will think ya wright you are nuts!! But, how much do you hate her "ALOT!!"  so this will blow her mind!! and you act like it is all fine and just a joke and that will really get her!! but if you act all embarrassed then it and every1 else will mock you and bring you do Forever!!! good luck  ( i know i am evil right) lol                                                                         I hope it work out!!|`|Xify43Taaa	OH COME ON! ok listen you and him are broken up so idont see why she is a backstabber because she likes him and u do to but u and hm are broken up so he is not yours anymore, as my bff would say "she/he is socable!)(that means any one can ask him/her out)so i dont think that u should bemad at her for any reason. and if you broke-up with him then u reallly cant be mad at her.like if u went to a store and saw a shirt that u wanted and u waled in and said" u know what i will buy it later." so them u leave the store and come back like 2hrs later and it is gone so u ake the cleark" what happened to that top!?" and she says that someone else put it on layaway. u cant be mad that someone else bought it because u dident, that anit right!|`|rAawJuWcaa	dam like if i was u i would be pissed 2  and i mean she should have asked you it wouldve have been better  and i think she kind of is a backstabber but that me|`|8pw8qDjPaa	what can you do? your (ex) friend and your ex (boyfriend) are going to do whatever they want to do. and technically your ex boyfriend is free to do and date whoever he wants. if your ex friend really cared about you she would of consulted you before dating him, so obviously she is a bad apple in the bunch. there's not much you can do except keep them out of your life until you get over it. thats the only way to make it better. other then that, just find new friends and keep yourself occupied. the only thing that heals a broken heart is time, but keeping busy will help time go by faster. hang in there! *hug*|`|t65Rb2YNaa	omggg the same thing happened to my friend. and ya she issss what kind of friend would fo tthttt thttss wrong and messsed up. wtf i mean fo real|`|CpotQhwkaa	that was not right of her. you should get a new friend. shes a jerk.|`|bobk0e0Raa	No... I don't think she was a backstabber, since technically you guys weren't still going out. I think it was a little b*tchy of her to not tell you, or even ask you first. If you're that bothered, then talk to her about it and explain how much it hurt you. I know it sounds really 3rd grade, but if she's a true friend she might respect your feelings or apologize. if she doesn't feel any sympathy at all than you shouldn't be friends with her.|`|QZLzCWKDaa	same thing happened to me. just don't talk too her and most people will say friends before boyfriends but there so wrong because they don't know whats happening. but i will say me and my ex friend are kinda better after he dumped he but i cant trust her like i thought i could before it happened. if you ever start being friends with her again, you cant trust her.|`|2QMWs032aa	well this is the exact situation i was in last year, except i was the one who got with my best friends ex. ive been friends with this girl for 13 years, and she had recently broke up with her ex, he started talking to me and what not and yo can imagine the pain i caused her cuz she stilll really liked him. the point is, just talk to your friend because she probably really feels bad since ur not friends anymore. and if she doesnt feel bad than she obviously wasnt as good a friend as you thouhgt she was. but idk bout her being a backstabber...      hope i helped =]]|`|N6frEVbiaa	yes she is a backstabber!   tell her that you're heart and if she's a ****** about it just forget her and him and move on|`|QQvzOu1saa	i know the type.|`|gecqeK6Daa	i don't think i would call her a backstabber, but what she did was VERY low. i am not sure about what you should do, but i hope everything works out. sorry i couldn't be more help.|`|KQqZF63oaa	I was thinking about this and i was gonna say she wasn't a backstabber just super bogus.  But if that happened to me i would be so angry and she would be a backstabber.  I am so sorry this happened to you.  Well I would let your anger calm down before doing anything but also wait till she says sum to you has she tried?  I'm sorry :(  Good luck .
iMpSfBblaa	Get to know her well, talk a lot...flirt a little. Make fun of her, NOT public humiliation, just gentle jibes. And yeah. Wait a while, then say something. Ask a friend for his/her opinion on whether she likes you or not.       Good luck.|`|C8TkypCNaa	WOW! You are lucky! That girl might like you! She is trying to get you to notice her, and you got her! That's great! Get to know her a little more.. And YOU take the first step, ask her, something from the Art Class or complement her art work too! Good luck! Hope this was a good answer! :)|`|K2dv9u7baa	Talk to her more; get to know her and then ask her out|`|HYZWFOO8aa	ask her whats the worst that could happen if she knocks you back so what everyone does try to stumble a bit as well girls think thats cut or you could ring her pass her a note or ask your friend to ask her for you
houWY7qvaa	I don't know how old your mom is, but she may be going through menopause.  You can have an early menopause, or change of life as some call it.  I remember being rude to my mom and her crying and I told her that her tears were fake and she walked away exasperated.  Two years later she told me that she was going through menopause.  I apologized for being so rude and cruel to her and she said, "that's okay, you didn't know".  and all was well again.   Not the entire story, but a short version of it.  Not all women have symptoms and some women have very bad symptoms.  Sometimes depression, crying, mood swings, aches and pains, etc.,   All I can say is be patient with her and ask that she do the same with you.  She may be going through other things that you may not be aware of.|`|XzLUA7ataa	You are over 18.  Take responsibility for yourself.  Your parents have done their job in raising you to this point.  Get a job, contribute to the family in any manner you can by helping out.  You are an adult now.  Appreciate what you have and be thankful for a mother that cares.|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	Be more respectful.  You're in your twenties and still living at home. Once you move out on your own I believe it is you who will regret the way you treated your mom.  Once you have kids of your own and take care of them and dedicate your life to them and they are "always in a bad mood" with you, you will see how sad and angry it makes you.  You only have one mom, be nice|`|LdzNb7zdaa	why dont u stand her..is there something bothering u that she did to u or u balming her ??? if theres something she did to u that u feel like that talk to her.sometimes mom do get on our nerves but not in the point of not standing her.|`|XaYAcLBsaa	I kinda have the same problem with my mom i love her but she is always so sensitive when i dont really agree with her. She gets on my nerves sometimes to, I am 40 and she still tries to make me feel guilty about somethings, so now I just kind of ignore the situations or we would be in an arguement everyday. Just try to get along with her as best as you can and if she starts to get on your nerves just leave for awile and see what happens. I still dont really know what to do.
02f1bc31749f26b37d78e2e8ad505a6baa	It is against the law to drop a spouse from insurance coverage until the divorce has been settled or some kind of arrangements have been made for insurance coverage. You need to contact a lawyer.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	He can do as he pleases until the court tells him otherwise.  Since when is CPA a law degree?|`|dVlLahozaa	If he was the one paying for it maybe but I am sure you still have some rights, consult a lawyer.|`|kyaCKtFHaa	he is correct he cant drop you off his insurance until you guys are completely divorce|`|RKhSRMlZaa	This is a question for an attorney or the Human Resources department at his company (or yours even).|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Hes correct|`|380f2eaea6445a0c8088bc24364a5491aa	This depends on what state you live in,in my state temporary court orders-issued between first filing and divorce prevent him from doing something like this.You  need to talk to a lawer about this,if your ex is being this vindictive at this stage of the game you will need all the help that you can get.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	In my state, you can drop a spouse from being a beneficiary on insurance, wills etc as well as take 50% of your bank balance and open another account in your name AS LONG AS you have not filed divorce papers yet. Once papers are filed, then nothing can be changed.|`|i5c9EcX8aa	no as his ex wife he still has to pay for some part you should sue|`|ohpedSQUaa	I would contact your husband's insurance company and find out.  From what I have heard he can't do that without a signature from you saying its ok.  Good luck!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	No he can't do this.  It is illegal!  Make sure your attorney knows that he has done this, and call the human resources dept or the insurance company and let them know what has happened.  Once you are no longer married, you will be sent a notice about signing up for Cobra.  Also, a life changing event such as marriage, divorce, birth of baby, you automatically can sign up for insurance through your place of work.|`|uBssj3Znaa	considering he is the one paying for the insurance, he can probably do whatever he wants with it.|`|encb0jc2aa	u are screwed, why don't you start sleeping with his bother|`|X7rPWJU8aa	if you and your husband are in the state ask your employer. if you don't find the answers you are looking for call the company he has insurance with. i think that he may be in for a rude surprise. when i filed for my divorce i had to keep my ex wife on for 1 year|`|k73IxCHaaa	Actually, according to the law your CPA is correct. However he should have given you the option of COBRA and you still have that option. If there are no children involved he will probably not have to carry you on his health insurance policy unless there are extending circumstances (pregnancy, debilitating disease, etc.). Of course all of this depends in which state you live as the laws are different.|`|AA11603829	It is his policy so he should be able to change it as he sees fit. There are no laws that require for a person to have insurance. I believe for it to be illegal it would have to state in the initial divorce filling that changes are not allowed to be made to current insurance policies until a set circumstance such as you can get insurance through your company during open enrollement or until after the divorce is finalized etc...  If he made the changes before the papers were filed then I would say it is too late. If he did it afterwards then he is in contempt of court.     Now since you work you should be able to get insurance through your work outside the open enrollment period. Usually a change of coverage is a reason to be able to change your policy at work as long as it is within a time frame of the change (31 days I think). Now if he made changes to his policy outside his open enrollement (if he has that) and lied to his insurance company and gave a false reason for dropping you then he could be in trouble for fruad.    I would say the only way to be given the option to purchase COBRA is if it was a company related issue for the loss of the insurance.
gNHHGFNMaa	I hope you don't really feel dumb yourself, that would be bad. You just have a problem, many people do. And you have to ask your boyfriend what he things about you. If he's okay with it, then there's nothing to worry about. He is just one of those people that are lucky and don't have to study much.|`|AA11263103	Don't worry . I feel dumb with my friends because I am only 1 pre-ap class (biology) and my friends are pre=ap gemonrty ! I know !! But You are better at things that your bf is horrible is. I have to work really hard too to get something like math or scince, but when it comes to cooking and photography, I can make the best pound cake ever.Just study hard and try find something your better than your boyfriend.|`|AA10986891	Maybe you are pushing your self to much and that is exhausting you & that is why you are having a harder time learning the material.    Since it is economics why don't you start reading news about the econmy and asking your profesor & bf how what you read would apply to what you are reading. That is going to give you a different perspective of things and it will give you a clearer idea of the subjects you studing.|`|B2vFQLU0aa	sometimes guyd like dumb girls !|`|TRuV4OS1aa	well you bf prolly needs to get his act together but you shouldnt feel stupid   you both go into the same college and you have much better work ethic in all honesty your bf sounds like hes just in college cause its somethin to do  you should be askin your self if you really want to support him the rest of your life by workin hard while he sits on his A$$|`|HJrTuihcaa	don't worry, some people get things easier then other people. ask your boyfriend for more help.|`|FF4J59pMaa	Don't feel like that. Everybody is different. You need to relax before a test. It is always good to study and be prepared but if you worry about it to much then you get everything all messed up in your head. The same thing happens to me sometimes. When you have a big test make sure you get 8 hrs of sleep a good breakfast and make sure you study. But dont feel dumb. Sometimes people dont need to study as much as others.|`|4aNNniauaa	I read a story, not a clearcut question, but stop feeling dumb. I mean you worked hard for that C, all you can do is continue to get help. And as long as he isnt calling you dumb, and is trying help there is no issue. The fact is deal with it, you have this problem, and youre working on it. What else is there?|`|efxBqKybaa	dont feel dumb! its not ur fault, he shud understand|`|FnPNuHdCaa	You most definitely are not dumb...the only people that are dumb are the ones that don't try to make themselves better.  We all have areas that we are weak, but if you're smart you'll improve in those areas.  Another thing: don't get caught up comparing yourself to others...it's one thing to look at someone else and have respect and admiration for them, but that doesn't mean that somebody else can't have that same respect and admiration for you.|`|U8x4J3Chaa	DO NOT listen to that person. The types of guys who like dumb girls are not worth dating. And about not doing as well as your boyfriend, Don't stress over it. In the big picture it doesn't really matter. Having a learning disability does not make you stupid and your boyfriend should be supportive of you trying so hard. So what if you don't get a hundred? The effort that you put into it is the only thing that matters. Your best is the only thing anyone can ever ask for. :]|`|OwfoyXpraa	aw, don't feel dumb.  It's not your fault; you know you're trying extra hard, and hey, a C is better than not passing at all. :)     Some people just have an easier time learning and understanding things. You, on the other hand, have an excuse because of your learning disability. I know people who would gladly trade you for that C who don't even have learning disabilities, haha.    Keep trying hun, don't feel discouraged. :) Remind yourself that you're doing your best, and keep getting help from your boyfriend and professor, and things will start to get better, no worries. Keep working hard.
LjO374MDaa	Why would you want to be serious  I share the same problem with you  Like you learned when you were young... There is a time and place for everything  If your boyfriend has something bad to say about you then whatever I'm sure he isn't perfect either  There isn't anything wrong with not being a boring serious person  LOVE YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!  GESH! Tons of people wish they could have your personality|`|AU3HVTToaa	noo|`|FF4J59pMaa	Yeah I understand what you mean. You can be serious and fun and care free all in one. You only have one life so live it to the fullest. But when it comes down to decision making or serious subjects just show you know its not a game. And honestly if he doesn't like the fact that you not a boring serious person all the time then he isn't the one for you. I like to have fun and be act like a kid. I'm 19 and my parents play around and ask me when am I going to grow up. I have my times where I just act goofy and act like a kid but at the same time I take care of my 2 sisters and brother, cleaning, cooking, and school. So I think you can be serious and fun at the same time.|`|RHOiO24Gaa	You just describe me. I have always been a lot of fun,I have no trouble making friends. People feel bad when I am not going to a party,they say it won't be the same. I was born this way and hope to die this way,always smiling. Don't change,but if you think you could be just a little more serious at times that's ok. for the most part be yourself,but there is nothing wrong with a little self improvement either.  First and foremost don't ever change for a man.|`|5r5tBMPFaa	................. What? I you not undestand !|`|9044049de30a44bf02cd045c6e508f31aa	dont try to change for a guy u may really love him but if he cant appreciate u for who u really are then he doesnt deserve u.try to talk to him about it though.let him help u.|`|eT4oBXONaa	dont change for him...but if you have to ...just show him little things that let him know that you care about him...leave him cute gifts|`|06QVH87Faa	Think British Television|`|70DZWz2Baa	Not everyone is serious. maybe you just think you are but send of the wrong message in the way you act.

The second guy only wants what he wants as long as he can't have it.  And he only wants you for sex, anyway - he figures you will put out for him.  He is acting like a tool.  Two jerks in a row!

If you feel that you can really forgive him, move on and not harbor any bitterness, then do so. If you feel that the relationship is right, despite this indiscretion, then go for it. Every one of us makes mistakes. Some bigger in scale than others, but no matter what, we don't deserve to be punished for them our entire lives.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	This is your choice, and i can respect that,but if it was me i would not marry him and i would tell him to hit the road,then move on. Crying don't change a thing , and punishing a grown man don't change that fact that he still cheated on you. Because once they cheat they will always cheat again and again. if the opportunity knocks they wil most likely to cheat|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yup. Once a cheater, always a cheater. Period.  Hope you've been tested for STDs and HIV/AIDS. If you haven't, do it NOW.|`|8bPmTLT0aa	Noone can make the decision for you, some people do forgive there boyfriend/ husband for cheating and it works out sometimes but then again if you forgive him he could also think that he can keep doing it and you will keep forgiving him...  Follow what your heart is telling you to do its your life not anyone on here's gppd luck!|`|gF6LRuP1aa	Dump him.  In my eyes, what he did was rape.  Would the other girl have consented to sex with him if she had known who he really was?  Nope, because apparently she was furious when she discovered the truth.  Of course, all of these answers are irrelevant because i don't believe this scenario actually occured.  Methinks that someone has been watching too many made-for-TV trashy films.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	First of all, you don't punish an adult. You are his girlfriend - NOT his mother. So this "only getting contact once, on V-day, as his punishment" is foolish and stupid and childish. Don't treat an adult man like a child. That's awful.     OK so you forgave him. Good for you. That's the Christian thing to do - forgive. BUT I wouldn't take him back. Leopards don't change their spots, my dear. He's a cheater and if he'll do it once - he'll do it again.    Especially if you treat him like a child by "punishing" him for his cheating ways. That will only exacerbate the whole thing and you'll be back here boo-hooing about a cheating husband.    Ditch this guy - and chalk the last 8 years up to experience.     and please, you're not his mother. Don't punish him. Forgive him. But ditch him, or you'll be quite sorry.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	No it's not enough punishment.  You are rewarding him for his behaviour by marrying him!  That is hardly an incentive for him to stop cheating in the future - he's basically gotten away with it.  Listen to his brother, he is right.    You doubt he'd do it again?  Think again.  He will do it again, it will just be a matter of time - especially since he really didn't suffer any serious consequences the first time around.|`|AA11603468	He got another woman pregnant, and you're talking about giving him a "punishment" as if he were a mischievous child who got into the cookie jar? Honestly, that makes me sick. if you want to forgive him, that's your business, but planning a punishment, but screwing him for Valentine's because you'd already planned to, is just so stupid. I'm sorry. If you don't care that he impregnated another woman, stop talking about it and let it go completely. Marry him, and hope your instincts are right that he won't make a habit of this behavior.    May I ask-how will you feel when he goes for visits with his new child with the woman he cheated on you with being there? Or, do you expect him to abandon this poor innocent child altogether? And would you actually WANT a man who could abandon his own child? That's sickening.|`|jF3XaAwNaa	From experience people don't change. Once they cheat they will always cheat.. Are you really willing to be step mommy to your fiance child with another women... Personally I would no way in hell take that person back.|`|ObJTgBafaa	OMG!  You need to dump him!!!  I know you've been together a long time but OMG...he got another girl knocked up...and not just any girl either, his brother's ex!!  That kid will be in your lives forever and it will be a constant reminder of what he did to you.      Not getting him a b'day present is not a punishment!   I think you should AT LEAST chop of his balls!!!!   The dirty bugger!|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	How would you be throwing something away?  You are talking about punishments as if he's a naughty boy. Dear oh dear.    Good god, woman, get a backbone!  He sounds appalling!  He WILL do it again and now you will have to cope with a baby in your life that isn't yours.    DUMP HIM NOW!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Speaking from experience, I think you're making a big mistake.  You have given him permission to do as he likes.|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	if ya'll don't have any children together leavehis butt alone. He cheated once and got away with it, he do again and again|`|ab67549a4ed164ffd53d6af3dbd65456aa	you are being nice to him. way way nice to him. if it were me, i would kick him out for some time and try and figure things out. i'd go on holiday with a few friends, have fun and see what and how I feel. Make him wait. make him feel the pain you are feeling now so he relaises how much it hurt and how it hurts. give him the benefit of the doubt. tell him you need time to think things over. if he is looking at your questions right now, then he will know all these things on here by the way. anyway, dont make him think he got away with it lightly. Make it as slow and painful and then say after a while you miss him and all that.|`|1b3ab1f5bfb9839f6af7c79693195feeaa	You should let him go and hook up with me. If I ever cheated, you would never find out, hence you would never be hurt.|`|tXh84hzSaa	I'm sorry but you don't need a life with someone like that. He lied about his identity in order to sleep with this woman. In my personal opinion, that seems a lot like rape. I'm sure this comment will be reported because of that statement, but I really don't know how you could ever trust someone like that again. He didn't just cheat on you (which is bad enough!) he fooled some unknowing heart-broken woman into sleeping with him!|`|at1Vev9Gaa	Cheating is the most sinful thing and the most hurtful. BUT if your willing to forgive him then move on. I think you should post-pone the wedding until you can trust him again and work things out. You dont want to fall on resentment and because its still there if you punishing him still after you have forgiven him. try some type of counceling before you get married. DONT RUSH INTO THIS MARRIAGE IF YOUR MEANT TO BE YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO GET MARRIED.|`|ebguWgVAaa	Ditch him.  There's no excuse in the world that makes what he did right, and if you continue on and stay in a relationship with him, you're never going to be SURE he won't do it again.  He may feel terrible about it now, and he MAY never do it again.  But if he was willing to do it this once, there was something about him, or you, or your relationship, that he didn't value enough to treasure.      You're better off alone, or with someone else who hasn't betrayed your trust.  Staying with him shows your own insecurities.|`|80Qa796baa	I think many of us have been in this situation.. and the thought of him not being in your life is so scary right?  But deep down you know what you need to do..  He doesn't deserve you and if he cheated on you.. then he's not the one for you..  if he loved you that much he wouldn't have done it.  I say.. you should get rid of him, yeah you'll be really sad and depressed for a long time.. but the right person is out there waiting for you.. and the longer you stay with a cheater the more your life is being wasted.  Sorry if that was harsh, I just know you're making a mistake if you stay with him and could do muh better.  I hope it all works out for you    x|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I dont want to tell you that you are wrong, but iv been with my fiance for 7 years and yes we have been through so much and i can not imagine my life without him, but if he did something like that...so stupid and immature..that's it for me..    i would cry and get depressed but i couldn't be with him...have some self steam and respect..dont marry a guy who's expecting a baby with someone else..you are setting yourself up for a problematic relationship...    its your choice though i hope i dont see more questions on YA saying...oh he did it again..or I realized I cant forgive him but we are married now and im pregnant...then it would be too late...so really think about it...dont get married because you already planned it...who cares about that..you should at least postpone the wedding and wait a while...until things cool down a bit..    remember hes going to be involved in her life for ever...his first child wont be yours...and all these things that you might want to do as a couple..will be ruin...just think if you can live with that and if you will be happy like that...    dont do it for anyone else...    good luck|`|8G7Yx9MRaa	maybe you should ask yourself if you want her in his life for the next 18 years? You do realize this child will want to see its father and you can't expect to "outlaw" that. It's not the child's fault that your fiancee is a complete d*ck.     I honestly would leave him. I know you two have been together for a very long time, but really...? What makes you think he won't do this again? You can't "punish" him forever. Otherwise it's going to be a child/parent relationship and you don't want that.     maybe if this girl he knocked up decides to get an abortion or adopt the child out, it might MIGHT be okay for you two to try to work things out. But if she plans to have the child, that woman will ALWAYS be in your life. Like it or not.     You decide. :)|`|EwNrlF8jaa	NO need to punish him that baby will be punishment enough and Lord forbid if that baby's mama starts acting up. He will live in his own little world of torture. Now about "you" you must evaluate how you feel about the entire situation. do you think you will be emotionally stable to handle this situation that wont go away any time soon. Consider counseling for your self, find out what it is about you that you are so emotionally unstable and need him sooooo much. once you get to the root of that you will know wether or not you can live peacably with him forgiving and helping him through this and supporting him seeing this child and having to have contact with the mother or if you should consider and do end the relationship. this is about you not him is affair the baby ect. its about you and whats good for you. good luck!!!!!!!|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	At the end of the day only you know whether you can fully trust him ever again.  Unless you can trust him then you will never have a happy relationship.    Do you knoww hy he cheated?  Until you talk through what happened and can be sure it will never happen again then I am sorry but it will never work.    What is he going to do about the baby? Either way he will always have another child with someone else and he will be legally obliged to financially support it.  Will he want to see his child when it is born?    There are lots of things that you need to sit down and work out with him. I would also make him have Sexually transmitted diseases tests before you sleep with him again just to make sure he never caught anything and will pass it on to you|`|ZhepEPG7aa	You say "how can i throw away something that I've been so involved in for so long", well he already did that, knowing that he wanted to have sex with her before he called her.    He isn't worth it if you cant trust him. period|`|F8iYNurEaa	Withholding sex is your punishment???? If anything, it will push him further away and maybe into the arms of someone else.     If you forgive him and want to stay with him then you need to stop punishing him. If you CAN'T forgive him and you are going to keep punishing him then you need to end it now coz this relationship will make you both miserable. I am not sticking up for him, as the way he has acted is despicable, however, you can't have a happy marriage with someone that you are treating like this. You will both grow to resent each other. Also, this baby is going to be in your lives for ever. Can you live with seeing his betrayal in the flesh for the rest of your lives. Just remember: you can't take your anger about his actions out on the child or find a way to punish your fiance and the other woman by not letting the child see it's father. The child is the unfortunate innocent party in this situation (as are you).     If this was my problem I would have got rid of him. He wanted to see what it was like to be his brother???? That is lame. Obviously you weren't enough for him and he was yearning for something else. He abused his position as your boyfriend and as a twin. How many other times might he have done this before and knew he could get away with it because he used his brother's name instead of his own?! It might seem like he is being 100% honest with you but the only reason he came clean about what happened was because 1) the other woman found him out and 2) she became pregnant. You can do better. Don't feel obligated to stay with him just because you have put 8 years into the relationship or because you're supposed to be getting married. Relying on someone is not a reason to stay.

Control your sex drive man, you have a lot at stake here that is a whole lot more important then an unfulfilled sex drive!  You're going to kill what little is left, if any love between you, if you take what's left over from her life, don't you get that?  You have to take a proactive stance that will help you each to sort out your feelings for each other and move on with your lives, whether that means together or apart - just remember, those kids need to be your focal point in all that BOTH of you endeavor to do to remedy this situation.

You have to live apart.  Trust me on this. I know its hard but its the truth. In the long run you both will be much happier. You can't begin to get over her until she is moved out.   When she starts dating and bringing guys around its gonna hurt.   I am very compassionate witch in turn makes me easy to take advantage of.   I assume you are the same. Separate, you need to be alone for awhile be single live life on your time. I am happier than ever. The next girl will come in time but its not fare to date when your not over the ex.  I still watch over my ex and keep her safe but at a distance. We talk and things are great.|`|CWLlxknoaa	O'k, be a MAN! what does it mean? If your ex says she does not love you any more then don't get humiliated and step aside. I mean, leave her alone, let her fall in love with that bad guy and understand he is really bad. Give her freedom. And do not show her you are crazy without her. She  has known it for long already. And what are the results?!  You also must become a bit more independent financially. Find a job, start making money and you'll become confident of yourself! When you respect yourself, this woman you love will get back to you, I'm sure.   Good luck!|`|df14a975e88aa3ace30d8ccaf12bf3e6aa	Your screwed if she stays with you. You are not trying to keep her safe, you are trying to win her, back.

If not your an idiot.  If she takes the kids you pay child support and get a smaller place, or a roommate.  You say you cant get over her its only been what a month a two? It may take 6 months or a year, but you must not live with her.  Who she sees is her business now, you have NO say.  Dont be a chump, eventually u will be over her.

She needs to leave your house.  And you need to move on with your life.  This is common in marriages too and the only recourse you have is move with your life, or make her believe that you have.  When other people notice how great you are it will make her wonder why she left.  I am not saying this will work cause it sounds like the classic "I love you, BUT im not in Love with you". In these situations you have to change yyour own behavior that caused this. And not say anything to her about you and how you feel, and mostly about the relationship.  And the other man is going to bet you hands down, its new and that new rush you cannot compete with and dont try, it will just push her farther away.  Good luck, im going though a divorce similar, though she says there no one else i just dont believe it.|`|dVlLahozaa	You are so Gay dude she is just mooching off of you and doing it doggy style on you bed. jA JA JA|`|2q0m4P1Daa	sounds like me.  the truth is you will not get over her until you meet someone else like she did.  just get mad at her that will work in the mean time, theres no point loving someone who doesn't love you.  trust me if she loved you she would be with you.
k73IxCHaaa	Divorce statistics themselves are not necessarily an indicator of who will and who will get divorced. There are hundreds of reasons why people get divorce none of which are in the statistics.     I have friends that had everything in common and got divorced as soon as the kids went off to college. I've had other friends married over 30 years who ended up in divorce. My wife and I have nothing in common and have been together for three decades.    Most people aren't ready for marriagege any more than they are ready to have kids. There is no training manual for either. Regardless of who you are, marriage is simply good old fashioned "hard work." Most people aren't eqipped to deal with it, because it requires skill to make a marrigae work, not love and emotions. Communication skills, Empathy skills, Financial Management skills, Sympathy skills and complete confidence that you are a good person who attempts to do the right thing.    Most people don't even know who they are, no less there spouse. We spend to much time thinking about what other people think about us rather than how we think about ourselves.    But if it makes you feel better I saw were one person gave you a link to the numbers. But if you think this is going to stop your friend from getting married you're in for a surprise.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Are they happy together?  IF so, butt out.

UXd0mYMSaa	heey! alright so recently my friend accused me of flirting with her boyfriend, even though i have a boyfriend and i don't like her boyfriend at all. just as a friend, you know. anyway. she kind of attacked me and was like, completely out of the blue, "i'm uncomfortable with the way you talk to my boyfriend, you don't respect boundaries, etc.". she said it in a really mean way and i was shocked and hurt that she would think i would do something like that. i guess my point is that you should make sure she's really intentionally flirting with your guy before you do anything, and when you do decide to talk to her, say it in a conversational way rather than an accusation. also, do it in person, like while your walking through the mall or down the hall in school, because my friend messaged me over facebook which was a lot more harsh than if she had just talked to me. also, one last thing, really try not to get anyone else involved, especially not anyone that's friends with both you and your friend. because that just causes a lot of unnecessary ****. i think that once you talk to your friend, she'll say something like "oh my god i didn't even realize i was flirting, i'm so sorry", because that's what i said! but maybe she is flirting, and if that's the case that's not okay. talk to her, and make sure she knows that you understand that you don't choose who you have feelings for but it is not okay to hit on someone else's boyfriend. if she continues to do it, she's not a good friend. the good thing is that you sound like you have a good relationship with your guy, and if he picked up on her supposed flirting than he's very aware. it's good that he mentioned it to you because it shows he is loyal. i think it will all be okay, try not to worry. girls can be catty and bitchy without even realizing it; just make sure you're not the one being like that, and you'll be fine :) |`|EBGmzjJFaa	just tell her  to back off from yo man!!!

The romantic possibilites are most certainly there.  If there is an interest on her part, she will respond to your pursuit with eagerness.

Don't worry, like I said, if you're meant to be together, she will stay with you!!    Good luck :)  And thanks so much for serving our country!|`|bM4zYt44aa	Probably not.  I've been in the Army for 5 years now and I have seen very few relationships make it through deployments and long distance.  It's the unfortunate fact that most women, or men at home while the other is away for a period of time, especially in the military when they know that we will be gone for a while and won't be able to come home that much, they cheat.  I'm zero for three on relationships making it through deployments.|`|aSdUzlIiaa	might wanna pick one|`|bnE4AjKqaa	if she loves you she will stay with you and support you through anything...|`|D5pFwj1yaa	If I understand you correctly your just about to date this girl? Well that'ss not good, you don't know her that well then and she might not be that attached to you. But you know her more than anyone, so what do you think, is she the type that would stay? Try to tell her that you'll come back home it might give her hope. In general military relationships are hard (i've been in one) and she has to know that before you leave. Talk to her about it is my best advice.

Love decreases because they are not being treated the way they want to be, not because they have sex.    Sex between people who love each other INCREASES the love they have for each other.    I'm not sure why you would think sex with your spouse would make you love them less or feel guilty or ashamed.  This is the exact opposite of what really happens.  I've never met anyone that felt like this.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	You're mixing up the meaning of words Sex & Making Love.   When first married you love each other & also are in lust so you have married Sex.  After a few years you love each other & Make Love which is more deep & meaningful.      Couples that are happily married have no reason to feel guilty or ashamed because they love each other & make love.     Why should love making decrease after 6 mths of marriage (unless their is an illness or pregnancy), you are talking about the decrease in Lust again mixing up the true meanings of the words.|`|v54vMQOUaa	um, did u get an arranged marriage or something?|`|96HWpdkFaa	My husband and I love having sex lol, we do it as often as we can!

Guys don't feel guilty after sex, and no sex doesn't take away from love it adds to it. and If you married the right person it increases after 6 months.|`|GggtYJBtaa	Noooooooooooooo. I married to my wife after a courtship of 10 years without having physical contact (even though we had enough chances).  Now it is 16 years.  We are still feeling like we are in honey moon.  I think the love enhanced on passing of time.  But you know there must be a perfect chemistry between the spouses.  Especially in sex there should not be any "don'ts"  only "dos".  No hesitation, no inhibition, no restriction.  Ofcouse not by force but with complete interest from both sides.  Then... why six months, 60 yrs you will continue to loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Now, she's talking to him, so I guess she wants you to understand that they're still "friends," right?    Do you think something is so wrong with you that you should tolerate that kind of disrespect? I don't.|`|IQXnS893aa	hell no that's not right!!!!|`|de5b71815398effb3d4e362c8eadaab2aa	Ummmm.

Drop her & move on. If you feel the threat that she may cheat, that alone is enough reason for you to leave because she has already done it in the past. Depending on how much you care about her, it may take some time to get over her, but you will get over her.|`|AA12115728	Well, if she had no choice because it was the civil thing to do (hi, and bye), no it wasn't wrong.  But otherwise, yeah, it was.  But what do you expect?  She's a cheater.|`|pnxEgqQuaa	Well yes and no. There's no harm talking to someone but then again if she cheated on you,  a)you still haven't dumped her and  b) it isnt a good sign if she is talking to him.    Ask her and confront her or just dump her. Why should you suffer?|`|IScK0gc3aa	no dude, thats ridiculus and im sure youre pissed off as hell and have every right to be... if she cheated on you with him, then she should go out of her way to avoid them (ignore that  bumped into each other okay to talk answr) if she wants thing to work out btwn you guys
29I8PWrxaa	I can see his point, as you said, about it being difficult for handicapped guests to attend a destination wedding like the original plans.  However, the wedding you are now planning sounds just fine.  As you said, it's YOUR wedding and your fiancee's, and if you are paying for it yourselves then they really have no say in the matter.      I know how you feel about having the wedding so far from your family.  My fiance's family all live across the country from us, we live about five hours away from my family, but we have decided to have the wedding in my hometown, five hours from where we now live.  It was easier to plan since I grew up there and it's a small town so we know a lot of people there and can get some good deals for flowers, the hotel, etc.  But my fiance's entire family has to travel to get to the wedding.  There was just no getting around it - someone was going to have to travel no matter where we had the wedding.      I think you should just tell your father how you feel about his comments just as you told us.  And after that, just plan the wedding the way you and your fiancee like.  Good luck and congrats.|`|76nTvO4iaa	One problem is that you respectfully changed your original wedding plans to accommodate his wishes.  He now thinks he has the power to call the shots about your wedding!    Quit discussing the wedding with your father.  It's not his wedding, he's not paying for it and he has no say about anything.  Save yourself the aggravation and change the subject when he brings it up.  If he won't allow you to do that, terminate the conversation.    BTW - People who care about you and want to be at your wedding will not bat an eye about traveling 250 miles to attend.  Don't let your blow-hard dad tell you otherwise.    ((hugs))|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	dude, i have two married brothers. one wedding was about 250 miles away, one was over 700.  they both invited aproximately 170 people.  and guess what? there were only about ten people invited to each that didnt show.  distance does not matter, if people really want to be there, they will be.        if YOU two are paying for the wedding, then by all means go ahead and make your plans how you want them.   unless your parents are paying, then they have absolutely no right to complain.  they already destroyed your original plans, so they should content themselves with anything you plan at this point as long as it is in state    make your plans and just try your very hardest to flat out ignore anything any parent says. unless it is something truely usefull like they found the same chairs for less money,  then just do your thing, and dont bother telling them anything that you are planning. if they dont know, they cant say anything|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Do not listen to them. Just make your plans and don't include them in it. If they want to throw a temper tantrum, then they can stay home.|`|a1esFJ53aa	Who's getting married here? YOU!    You need to be firm, you need to have a wedding you and your fiance can look back on and have great memories about instead of looking back and realising that everything wasnt how you wanted it, if 20 people or 120 people showed up, it doesn't matter, all that matters is that you get married and enjoy it in the process! Wedding planning must be stressing you out enough without all the extra hassle.    Just be firm, stick to what you and your fiance like, learn how to say 'no' (you'll feel much better for it in the end!), when the day comes, your dad will realise you planned it right and will see how much this means to you and hopefully loosen up about it!    Good luck!! :)|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Oh wow parents can be difficult...you think that's bad? My fiance hasn't even told his family we're engaged yet and the wedding is set for aug 09 because of all the stuff they'll put us through lol  So the bast you can do is sit him down and say look this is what we have our hearts set on and we already got most of it planned already and ask him to understand...after that there is not much more you can do but cross your fingers and hope they come...either they'll accept it and move on or they wont go, but it sounds to me like they do love you and i'm sure they wouldn't miss it for the world.    P.S. I give you kudos you seem to care alot about your wedding your fiance must be happy about that. It's so hard to get a guy to care too much about anything...lol Well I wish you all the best of luck. And don't settle to make mom and dad happy this is about you and your fiance.|`|AA10378447	When he's acting all negative, just tell him, "Thanks for the idea. I'll take that into consideration if it fits into our overall vision for the wedding."    Don't let him get to you. What's he gonna do? Not show up? If he doesn't, then he'll miss your great party, and shame on him. If he's being "unrelenting", then HE's the one with the problem, NOT you. It's not your issue to fix. It's his. He needs to grow the hell up. Keep planning your wedding as you see fit.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	you know what you do  tell everyone you and your soon to be will get married on x day in vegas or where ever   if they show up they show up  well if money really isnt that big of a issue can you afford to pay for  10 guests flights or hotel rooms? look into villas or something in that nature  might cost flights and rooms 2 3k  i would put them in standard hotel rooms they must pay there own food and what not  and let it be if they dont want to attend then they dont have to they need to tell u 3 months ahead of time for booking if they plan to go and let it be if they say no  then dont let them come  send them some photos|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You should plan your wedding in a place about half distance from each side of your families so everyone has equal traveling. As for your dad shooting down your plans it is YOUR wedding. Why are you letting him act like a selfish ***? If he doesn't want to make the trip then he doesn't deserve to be there. Make it special for the two of you.     Tell your father you love him very much but you and your fiance have decided that this is how it will be (insert destination, day, time, ect.). Don't ask his opinion. Don't apologize or justify yourselves. Tell him he is invited to share in your day and you hope he will be there. Leave it at that. If he starts naysaying, interrupt him and tell him that the matter is settled and you'd really appreciate it if he would stop trying to detract from your happiness and just relax.|`|AA11454606	I think you were right to consider the family and relocate to something more local. However, if your life is 250 miles from your parents they are going to have to deal with it.  You don't have to give him an ultimatum. Finish your plans without your parent's involvement and they can find out where the wedding is when they get the invitation.  This is not their day, it belongs to you and your girl.  It is not about the wedding its about the marriage. You have enough to deal with agreeing with your fiance about it.|`|AA11484395	You say that you are paying the bill. Your call then. Try to locate a place near to where you and your friends live that isn't to hell and gone from your parents home. But as for cake, flowers, etc. etc. Your call, not your father's. You and your fiance pick the music, cake, decorations, etc. It's your wedding and you and your fiance are footing the bill. Inform your father that you are having the wedding at x location, with x number of guests and that the details (cake, pix, flowers, etc.) have  already been worked out and that you hope he will be able to make it to the wedding. Period. Grow a spine kiddo, you are going to need one.|`|FnskUYpqaa	Just sit down and talk to him remind him that this is your wedding and he needs to be understanding just like you were when you changed your wedding from the caribbean. Also tell him you understand that everyone may not be able to go and your happy with whoever can make it.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	A friend of mine that got married in September of last year gave me the BEST piece of advice. Smile, nod, then do what you want. It is YOUR day. Not your parents. Do you really want to regret your day because you let someone else use you as a doormat?   If he is not paying for it, don't listen to a word he says. He sounds like my FMIL. lol. I finally had to sit her down and tell her "I would like to involve you in the wedding plans, but if you can't agree with what I want and what your son wants for OUR day, then I'm not going to involve you. If you can stop creating drama I am more than happy to include you."   She hasn't said a negative word since and actually gave me some good ideas that I may use.|`|IxoazyHUaa	Is your dad funding this wedding?  If not, plan the wedding you want, tell him what the deal is and let him be the one to decide if he can or cannot participate. If yes, scale back your wedding plans to something you can afford yourselves and still do it your way.|`|tXh84hzSaa	Wow. Okay, first remember that this wedding is not your Father's and unless he is paying for it then he has no say. Period.     Then sit him down and have a nice talk about how he upsetting you. He may not get it, he may believe that he is being totally reasonable and helpful. Remind him that the guest list, cake, music, and everything else is your responsibility and not his. When he throws a fit calmly inform him that "this is our wedding and you don't have attend if you don't want to". Chances are he is coming either way, though I would save that statement for a last resort. If all else fails stop talking to him so much, not completely just enough to keep you sane. And change the subject quickly when the wedding comes up.    How does your fiance feel about all this? Just curious.|`|hvK5UG3jaa	Be cordial and appreciative. Simply be nice. Your Dad really means well. But this is your day with your man. It should be exactly how you want it. Tell your parents how much you love and appreciate them and go on with your plans with some compromise on a few things. You are still Daddy's girl. Make it fun. (Get RSVP s from everyone)|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	It can work in both ways have a small wedding at your parents home or ur fiance parent then for your dream have close friends who will come  and be there no matter what at the place you want.|`|ebguWgVAaa	I'm planning a wedding and dealing with some of the same things.  I ended up having to tell my mom, flat out, "It's not your wedding."  I said it three times before she stopped bothering me about stuff.      Don't involve him the plans.  Invite the people you want, make the arrangements you want, and let the people invited worry about how/if they'll make it to your party.  if they love you and they can swing it, they'll show up.  if they can't make it, they won't, but they'll send their blessings anyway.    Remember - and remind him anytime you feel it necessary - that it's not his wedding.  Try a nice tack first:  "Dad, I know you want to be involved in this wedding, but it feels like you're just running me over with all the things you want, and I'm struggling to pick between what I want my own wedding to be like, and trying to make you happy.  Can you lighten up a bit?"  If that doesn't work, try my tack:  "It's not your wedding, Dad.  Let me handle it."|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	Just don't tell him what the plans are going to be. If he asks tell him it's a surprise. He is going to shoot down everything you say anyway so why bother. After the plans are set in stone and can't be changed he can complain all he wants but it will be what it is.

Now she is also interested in another guy, and has already had "fun" with quite a few others.  On top of all that she still lives with me.    In your case I would say it isn't too soon.  As long as you feel ok about it than it doesn't matter what he feels, because he cheated on you.    In my case it hurt a lot and almost everyone agrees with me that she moved on way too soon.    But since he cheated on you, he obviously isn't caring about your feelings.

ZqmgJvHBaa	You're mom is being over protective, but it's just because she loves you and doesn't want anything bad to happen to you.  You should explain to her that you are old enough to make responsible decisions about driving, you have studied hard and passed all the tests, and believe that you are capable of driving on your own.  Tell her that you have faith in yourself and she should too!  Act responsible in all aspect of life, and hopefully your mom will translate that towards you being a responsible driver.  As long as you consistently show her you are capable, she should lighten up eventually.  It may just take her time to let go - you being able to drive on your own means you are now old enough to start making your own life.|`|Uzzv4FYZaa	Wait a minute.  You're 18, a legal adult.

If you have not given them any problems with discipline, have not had curfew problems, do your school work to the best of your ability, and keep your temper under control, I believe that your Mother needs to loosen the reins and allow you to grow-up.|`|8aA31siRaa	If you have you're license and you're 18, you can do whatever you want. (At least in Canada we can, I don't know if you're legally considered an adult where you are).     However, if you want to use your mom's car, she has every right to want to be in it with you. I think that's unreasonable, but unless you own the car, you have to live with whatever she wants.    I suppose if you really want to talk things through with her, the best thing to do would be to prove how responsible you are with the car, and the best way to do that would be to show her - which means she'd have to be in the car with you anyways. Hopefully she'll get less anxious about it all and be more accommodating after a while.|`|nY5shKkBaa	Your question is your answer. If you are not mature enough to talk to your Mom you are not ready to handle driving on your own.  I assume you live in your parents home or this would not be a problem.  If you own your own car move out and drive where ever you want all day long.  If you live on your own problem solved.  o yea you should be thankful your mother cares.

y3HLL203aa	Whatever you are going through must seem pretty rough to you if you're thinking about running away.  However, running away is not the answer to your problems!  I lived on the streets as a kid, not by choice, and it's not fun.  There are a lot of people out there who prey on young runaways, with intentions of harming them.  Young girls r not the only ones that are sexually assaulted you know.  Look I'm telling you things that really happen in the real world.  People are not as giving and kind as they used to be, there is a real chance of being hurt out there!!!  Please talk to a counselor at your school, talk to another family member that you can trust, if you are being abused go to the police, at least you will be placed somewhere safe, you will have food, be able to go to school, shower, you know all the essentials of life.  Please talk to someone before you make the biggest mistake of your life.  I found this helpline for teens that are thinking about running away texas teen hotline 1 (800) 210 2278 1(888)580-help        I hope it helps|`|Uy8ntukjaa	There are shelters for runaways but you really should look into some options because a lot of them are overcrowded. Do you really want to live on the streets? I know you don't want to call a number but you can do it from a payphone and at least get some information about somewhere safe you can go.  1-800-RUNAWAY    The hard reality is that living on the streets is dangerous. A lot of kids get in with the wrong crowd, get killed, or get hooked onto drugs. Many are also forced into the sex trade. You don't have to change your mind about running away, you're obviously smart if you know to change your appearance and to get bus tickets but at least arm yourself with some information before you do it. I've been to DC and it is a rough place with some very unfriendly streets.    Good luck to you. I hope this helps.|`|Jd1bHebRaa	I know from experience, bring tons of seeds so when you find ground you can plant the seeds and grow food. It's easy and it keeps giving you food, so you don't run out often. Bring a blanket, a towel, a pillow, bring a reusable water bottle, bring a phone but change your number, bring a notepad and a bunch of pencils and pens, bring pics of your friends and family so if you ever have kids and such u can show them your fam and friends, if you can, then bring a laptop too, but change ur email and AIM adress. Bring at least $500.00 and some food in cans and things. Then for the first week stand out on the street and use a can to collect money from people. Tell them you are homeless (which is technically true somewhat) and you really need money. Don't give up until you reach a total of $1000.00. Then each time you spend $10.00, stand on the street to earn another ten dollars, so you always have $1000.00. You can rent a hotel room once a week for one night to give yourself luxury. Then you can go around and BEG like crying to the store owner if you can sleep there at nights. If they say no, go to another store, etc. If they ask why you are there alone tell them that your a. really sixteen and b. your father died and you and your mother used to live on the streets and she took care of everything, but she just died, and you relly want to sleep indoors for a while. It works, trust me. Good luck!!!!!|`|5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	You have me stumped on the "CHECKPOINTS" ?!?  What "checkpoints"?  I didn't know the U.S. had "checkpoints"?    The best advice for you is to tell someone you trust what is really going on ... whatever that is.  You didn't mention one thing about WHY you were leaving, so no one can give you any advice that will be truly helpful for you.    "Checkpoints" ?!?    Your questions on your profile are marked private and there are no "checkpoints" tranversing the U.S., making you and your question are quite interesting.|`|XsLzNBe1aa	uhmmm im not sure this is the smartest ides...but if you are sure this is what you want...then i guess go through with it...umm once you get to d.c. you can look for homeless shelters....|`|r64eBg1haa	well why would you runaway  think about your parents and your family if i were you id sell those tickets and no offense get some consoling|`|CbqXWfY4aa	I won't say anything to stop you, just that you're really brave to do this, and some people must have messed up bad to make you feel like you have to leave everything. But first of all do you have any money to live off of??? You can't expect to make it if you don't have some saved up. . . Also you need to look up on the Internet or something and have somewhere to go. . . that way you have a goal, and you're not sleepin on the street. But i don't want u to do this all alone. . . if you ever need to talk or vent. . . email me. . . and i promise i won't try to tell you what's rite or wrong. . . just know you have some1 to turn 2. . . K? Good Luck!
TdriV6huaa	that is an interesting answer.  i do not think that there is a typical number of children to have because some people don't have children, some people have four and others have ten!  therefore i do not think that there is a typical number, but according to wikipedia, the average number of children is 2.3.  you cannot have 2.3 children, but i think that the average should be more like 3 or 4.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	I don't know what the average number of kids are...but i have eight children ranging in ages from 18 to two...i love everyone of them and am proud of them each on their own abilities.|`|TZw9Q7pOaa	Average 2 to 3 children.|`|AA10065812	*** Finding out is ease, just check the Census Bureau web site.    You need to look at more than the average size of the family.  Break it down to economic.  Whereas there has been little change in the size of low income families, there has been a significant change in the size of middle and upper income families.  In Europe, where the majority of women are middle income and above, the choice to have 2 or less children over the last 2 decades has resulted in negative population growth.  Some countries has even offered substantial rewards for having children.    In the U.S., the reduction in middle and upper class birth rates, and especially in nearly 30% reduction in the birth rate of male children in all income levels, is having a direct affect on Social Security contributions.  In the 70s, there were seven middle and upper income workers for every person receiving Social Security.  Today, it one on one.  The average birth rate of children to middle and upper income women is less than 1, with a growing amount of these women choosing not to have children at all.  This while nearly 50% off all children being born are to single, low income women.  And, as I said above, they are now mostly female children, which will not seek out the high income jobs only worked by men, because of the high rate of injury and death on these jobs.    The very social fabric of our planet is changing, due to the changes taking place in the choices of whether to have children or not.  Further, due to so many of today's potential child baring adults being raised in divorced families, where over 60% of the fathers were denied access or were marginalized, the people that are having children feel that an intact family is no longer needed or desired.    It is my hope you can see there is a lot more to the discussion of the changing size of families than just saying people are having less kids. I know I'm a broken down old fart, but I'm also an observer of human nature and the changes in our world.  If you want, email me and we can discuss this further.  take the time to talk to other old farts.  Interview a family and/or criminal court judge.  Talk to some old farts at a retirement home.  Make this into a report to be proud of.|`|AA12081834	2?
5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	Since you are "D", I'd be interested to know who "A" and "C" are, since we know that "B" is the selfish guy.  Maybe this can all be solved using algebra.      Best advice is not to worry about "B".  There are plenty more letters in the alphabet.  You are sounding a little possessive of your friends.  Don't be.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	It is your friend's decision whether or not to be involved with someone. You've told her what you think of him but beyond that it is out of your hands.|`|r64eBg1haa	I think that you and your friend b need to sit down and talk about your problems with each-other and see what you can do to fix it
tN6JA7IQaa	Either he still likes you, or you were one of the most exciting things that happened to him in his life. Why else would he waste his time talking about you? You obviously made an impression on him. (: Just ignore him; it's pretty flattering to be constantly talked about by an ex.|`|hpxc5szsaa	Um....probably because u havent given 'IT'' to him yet...LOL|`|EwNrlF8jaa	He feels like he has to explain why you arent together anymore and he feels like he wants people to know it wasnt his fault, poor thing if only he knew people really dont care.

It was not he dumped me and got a gf a month later. Just move on. Your prolly really pretty and smart and so to protect his ego he talks ****. Is he short?? That could also add to his obvious insecurity.|`|6gwqO3ouaa	It's simple...He's not over you. Did you guys have a bad break up? He's mad about something. It's very flattering to talked about by an ex. Unless you did something horrible and he's telling everyone. But if you were a good girl he's upset that you're gone so keep doing what your doing and wear a smile on your face. He seems to be very childish, is he a boy or a man?
5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	Focus on you, not him, and enjoy your own personal work ethic and your own work routine, which sounds great.  For all you know, you may be making him feel like he's obsessive/complusive and wishing he were more balanced like you.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Put yourself in his shoes. Maybe his home life really sucks and all he has to look forward to is work. It gives him self esteem and a sense of accomplishment. Maybe he really wants to get a promotion and wants to be sure his managers are noticing that he is a go getter. Maybe he just really loves his job. The point is, if you do your job well and consistently you shouldn't feel threatened by his performance. Are you worried you're going to look like a slacker because you take a lunch break? Don't. Do a good job and don't compare yourself to your coworkers. I never get annoyed by overachiever's because I know that I have a good work-life balance and I'm not burned out at the end of the day.
QnhBODNWaa	try to be around him more than the other girl, or just constantly flirt with him.  he'll definitely fall for you sooner or later.|`|VCRP9efqaa	you should talk to her and   tell her that u think that none of you guyz  should go with him.  and if she's really your friend, she'll agree.  because none of you guyz going with him is the only fair thing  that you can do.
aXYiOskmaa	it doesn't matter if your gay. it doesn't matter if you can't get pregnant. sexual is sexual and if you're underage, this isn't right. sounds like you're using your sexuality as permission|`|XzLUA7ataa	How about the truth?|`|0GZ7OIVsaa	Do what i do.  i lie to my mom telling her im sleeping over my friends house.  why dont u do that.    or     if they dont kno your gay then tell them you'll be sleeping over you friends house which is your boyfriend.|`|LdzNb7zdaa	do ur parents know u are gay???|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	How old are you?  If you are a teenager then they are absolutely right to say no to you sleeping at your boyfriends house.  It's not about getting pregnant, it's about appropriate behaviour.  If you are not a teenager, and you don't like your parents rules, it's time to move out. If my daughter wanted to sleep at her bf's house, or if she were gay and wanted to sleep over at her gf's house I would definitely not approve and it would be no.  Your bf's parents are not doing the right thing allowing you to sleep together.|`|y43tzOQlaa	First question is how old are you? It is very hard for a parent (regardless of your preference) to take that first step of letting a child stay at a boyfriend or girlfriends. The first time we allowed a "sleep over" they stayed in the living room, we know that things can still be done but I think it made us feel better. It got easier as time went by, so the first time is the hardest. Maybe his parents can talk to your parents. They have to know you'll find a way to be together either way so letting you be honest about it is the best way. Just don't be to "in ur face" about it if their having a hard time with it. Be patient, it'll be ok.

CQySHj5oaa	Coming from a woman, who was once a girl, who relied on always having a good guy friend on the side, through 2 abusive relationships in high school..<br>  <br>  It is time for you to leave her. Have one last convo with her. Tell her that you'll always be there for her, when she is ready to leave the jerk. But until she does, you can't keep watching her go back to the abuse. <br>  <br>  What she is feeling right now when it comes to you:<br>  -Once a girl marks you as a "great friend" to her, all romance goes out the window. Sorry, it's really a sad reality, but it's true. <br>  -She is loving the fact that she has her cake and can eat it too. She has the romantic attraction to the jerk, and she gets a part of her emotional fulfillment from you. Basically between the 2 of you, she can have a semi decent relationship. She is using you..I'm so so sorry to say it like that, but it's an unavoidable truth.<br>  <br>  START THINKING about what is best FOR YOU instead of what is best for her. Don't waste any more time on this. You'll only find heartache in the end. <br>  <br>  HUGS and CHEERS to you.|`|7En0G0oqaa	yes u need to dissapear that's it
cdzZBd4Xaa	I think maybe you should try talking to her as a friend as far as her relationship goes.... meaning that maybe don't tell her about your future plants with her till she is out of her current relationship, over it and has moved on. She obviously loves him to be with him that long. And No I don't think it has anything to do with your looks. Shes just in a bad situation. When you are comfortable with someone you seem to stay with them no matter how bad they treat you, even though you know its wrong. Just tell her that she cant go on forever with him, she needs to leave him and she deserves better than how shes being treated by him. Let her know that you will help her and you will be there for her no matter what. If she does leave him maybe in a few months talk to her about how you feel, but right now she needs a friend more than anything. Its really not healthy jumping from one relationship to the next. She is also really young to be dealing with such big problems, she needs to contact the police and she needs to deal with him! Or even get her parents or an adult who she trusts involved. If her boyfriend is already doing this hes only going to get worse.|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	its definitley not your looks <br>  matbe she just doesnt realize there r better guys than the A$$ shes dating now if i were you i would talk some sence into her tell her that he treats her like $h!t and shes worth so much more then being treated how she is and also tell her that your a bettr guy for her<br>  maybe it will work but try it <br>  hope it helps<br>  Sarah. V|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	You look fine and if she didn't look you for your looks, then she's shallow--and don't need her anyway. I think, she always needs a man in her life and you were handy and wants to make sure you are around in case the jerk screws up again. Women like that have some kind of psyche problem that they can't or won't get away from men that treats them this way. I would move on|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	I'm not going to look at your pic because I think it's irrelevant.  You've said your feelings to her right?  She needs to decide.

Good luck!|`|1708202e3be570491d625333bfa130d4aa	Looks should have nothing to do with it...   With that being said you have two choices <br>  1. Stick around and watch her get hurt by this guy(and if someone is being abused you should get evidence and report it)(just what I would do) and let her make her own mistakes and pick up the pieces when she finally comes to her senses...<br>  2. Just go on with your life maybe she will see in time that you are who you say you are and love you for you.<br>  <br>  I'm not gonna say your too young I was married at nineteen and we are still together and totally in love...<br>  <br>  However the unique thing was both my husband and I could not do the on again off again you either love each other or you don't... so when you break up make sure that's what you really want no going back!!! although that's just us heartbreak sucks...<br>  <br>  I do think she is a little young to be settling down but stranger things have happened... and I find it very respectable that you would wait to be married ...Congrats  <br>  <br>  There are no right answers  if you think she is the one then your heart will tell you what to do!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|MMiG2bzeaa	Its not your looks...your okay. She is obviously young and stupid. If she had sex at 15. She probley thinks its okay for him to hit her. I think u should just straight up tell her how you feel.<br>  Say: You now how much i like you, but your bf situation needs to end and you know that. etc. etc.<br>  Let her hav time to think. Dont be discouraged if she says no. You will deffently find someone else.<br>  good luck bye|`|kXPmr9oDaa	as for right now, you should just be a great friend to her. be supportive and loving towards her and shell eventually relize that youre the better guy than that other guy. txt her and call her like every other night to check on her to see if shes doing ok. if shes sad or mad about something(her bf), just be helpful to her, give her advice and say i hope everything works out with you two." if she says shes happy with him say im happy for you, even if your not, cuz itll make her feel special. be a good friend to her and when she finally laves that dude, dont immediantly go for her, be a good friend and gradually bring that subject up about you two being together, good luck dude! dont dissapear from her life. it sounds like she could use a good supportive friend|`|n2P9vD1eaa	Alright, right off the bat - don't worry about your looks (do a certain degree!) If a woman doesn't like you because of your looks, she's not worth it. (Same vise versa). With her, It seems to me like she's playing you. My suggestion, forget about her. Unless she starts coming to you, forget about her. She's not worth the pain. If she would rather have some wife beating asshole, she'll learn her mistake in the end. If you still like her, and would be willing to be there for her, I'm sure she'll be all the more willing to like you. Just remember, you're 17. You've got your life in front of you. There will be other girls. Just tell her you'll always be there as her friend.|`|st9KHhoKaa	You need to tell this girl how you feel, don't leave it and say nothing. You will regret it. She is only getting back with her ex because he has manipulated her mind, she is affected psychologically, physically and emotionally and will need counselling. <br>  <br>  I know because i had an abusive ex boyfriend who used to hit me plus he was a drug addict so he was all over the place. <br>  <br>  It comes down to self esteem and fear, and that is what she is feeling. <br>  I only came back to him because i was scared, and thought i could help him...people like that like to abuse and use people for their own gratification he was a sociopath!! <br>  <br>  You must speak to her face to face and tell her how you truly feel. <br>  <br>  DO NOT DISSAPEAR AND GIVE UP!! DONT LEAVE HER TO SOME FREAK LIKE THAT WHO COULD SERIOUSLY DO WORSE BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!
XjvxE383aa	This girl is in a destructive and abusive relationship. She is only 15 and that raises a lot of concerns. Is there a way to make her parents or family aware of whats going on in her relationship?<br>  <br>  To be honest with you she sounds like she doesn't know what she wants. It seems like she wants you to want her. Put your feelings for her aside and try to get her help. she needs time to heal and needs to speak with someone as to why she is allowing this abusive behavior to go on and that it is completely unacceptable and NO ONE deserves to be treated in that way.|`|BFNGx3DOaa	I have no clue man it all sounds pretty messed but if you like her that much tell her that and stand by that anwser no matter what.|`|AA11221025	she likes bad guys and she has no room in her life for you. dont waste any more time with her. be her friend if you  like but look for someone else to be a great guy too. you sound lovely - but link didnt work for photo|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I think she has a lot of problems and you should move on.  She keeps going back to him and that means she has a lot of work to do on her own self-esteem. You can't fix this for her - only she can.  One thing to learn in life is you can't fix other people.  They can only decide when they've had enough of a bad situation and decide to change. In the meantime, she has you in limbo - you should move on.
N3U7xWAPaa	your a little lonely but don't be cheating be faithful unless you really want to loose him and theyre is no issue with having male friends long as you and them both know it and don't tell them you like them your not being faithful then and your not being true to yourself and you need to know that when you really like someone (dating) you should be able to go a day without speaking and not be an issue     over all : you can keep adding male friends .. stay with being friends and be careful what you say to them and stay true to your boyfriend or you'll loose him and if they say they like you say too bad i am taken by a wonderful guy :)     P.S: he must really like you if he  wants to stay with you  and he moved away .|`|R1oSxvyXaa	well if you truely love your boyfriend  its not that hard to to not flirt with other guys  just remind yourself about how much you love him.  delete the guys on myspace if you have to  they arent going to mean anything to you  in five ten years anyway.  even if you arent with your boyfriend now  (:|`|xXWSpw5Saa	ur lonly

If the weather is nice, you can always go on nature trails or to the park for some free activities.  It might be nice to set up some tutoring sessions where you can help them with homework and then bake cookies as a reward for a job well done.  Just spending time with them will make all the difference.|`|N4KyJ8aVaa	take them over your house and watch tv witht them or play a board game. they're young that would probably be exciting for them.    maybe when you have cash take them for ice cream or to a movie .     u could also try taking them to a park or just let them hang around with you. they'd probably really enjoy it and they'd feel cool hanging out with older girls.     i think what you want to do for them is really nice . good luck & u your sister sound like good people|`|xXWSpw5Saa	go to the park get ice cream|`|FU5z9yWuaa	that's really sweet ..i think u should start off by taking them over to ur house and just letting them be with ur family so if u guys ever do barbecues etc.. just let them be involved then a gd outing with out the movies just a normal day out maybe seeing some attractions going to a cheap theme park ..hope it helped
ERjGLJaEaa	Well you say talking about is it not an option. How long have you been friends? Is it worth saving? Because if it is you should simply let her know that you think shes been distant. Maybe there is an issue and it can be fixed. Just remember good friends are hard to find. I'd not let this fizzle out. Good luck!|`|JurCyY2Gaa	confront her and ask her about it.|`|SJbktLITaa	Find better friends if not they will find you.

f2J7jhlraa	maybe you should find someone to talk to about this.maybe a friend or a professional you need to stay strong mentally so that you can be there for your mom and because you need to take care of yourself- sometimes the people that we care about the most don't realize it hurts us  when we see things happening to them. sometimes when people are going through abusive situations they are afraid to leave because they might be scared it will be worse on them or maybe they stay because they "care" about the person they're with but they don't see the other person don't feel the same way-they just want to control things.you need to take care of yourself mentally-stay strong,your mom might need you there for her one day when she sees what's happening.take care of yourself and good luck.yor sister is only acting out what shes seeing.she needs someone there for her also.|`|1k7pcUHkaa	just shoot them both|`|BbzFR8eCaa	Tell her that what she is subjecting her children to is tantamount to abuse and you will do what you can to get your little sister out of it.

OIJ3JBkSaa	i don't think there is any particular age - i have friends who are only 20-something and i wonder why they aren't married yet, while i have other friends who are much much older and not married and its never occurred to me to wonder why.  its an attitude thing, a lifestyle thing for me - my 20-something friend is a teacher and madly in love with children so i do wonder when and if she will find the right man, get married and settle down.  other older friends are so into their careers, or their own lives that i don't think marriage would work for them - at least not right now. your cousin was 33 and getting married i would assume that up to that point she was busy and happy and content with her life as it was.    anyway that's just me!  i hope my thoughts have helped somewhat. cheers!|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	well now its any age today|`|kHEFi3ttaa	30, but it's common for women in my area to be married by 25. I think the last I heard the national average was 27 to get married.    I wouldn't label someone over 30 as a spinster though... Spinster seems going a bit far. I have a male friend who's 47 and has never been married, when I told a friend of mine that is over 30 about him she goes "What's wrong with him to have never been married?" It was funny, the funniest part is that he's an attractive, sensitive, etc. He's a real gentlemen, he's just never found 'the one'. I would assume the same for a woman over 30 that wasn't married, she just hadn't found 'the one'.|`|PBdPD748aa	I would think the obvious age where I would wonder would be 30.....     i am getting married young though =]|`|AA11883252	30|`|cTM6vQeBaa	29 by the time your 30 if you've never been married your an old maid|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	spinster is what you call an unmarried woman who has never been married before.  Just like an unmarried man who has never been married before is a bachelor.      It's an outdated and old fashioned word that we no longer use because of it's negative connotations but it has nothing to do with age.  the only reason it has negative connotations is because society up until very recently hasn't like unmarried women and doesn't know what to do with them.  the term "bachelorette" to describe a woman who has never been married is a late 20th century term coined because the women's movement objected to "spinster" but "bachelorette" is never used on legal documentation to describe a woman's marital status.    as to how old a woman is before people think "why isn't she married":  from my experience it's somewhere shortly after your 20th birthday or after you finish your final degree in college.    according to my family I'm somewhere between "we don't care about his race, occupation, religion, country of origin, or legal status"  and "you know, it's alright with us if you're gay"  (I'm not BTW)  ; )|`|AA11603468	My husband and I were 38 when we married for the first time last year. I guess peple wondered what was wrong with us, but I never cared if I was married, and I surely wasn't going to marry ANYONE just to be able to say I was married. It's much too important a step for that nonsense. I dated much, but nobody who I felt I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. So, while so many my age are divorced, now living as single parents or doing the step-family thing, we're newlyweds who have lots of life experience behind us, and who were able to start our marriage in a new home we built together, because we're both established in good careers. Life has always been good--now its incredible.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	The average I think is 27, knowing that I'd say 35.|`|F5qGKwfUaa	There isn't an age. People get married whenever they fall in love...most of the time anyway.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	30. I want to be married young though, so I guess any older than 30 and I'd wonder what they were waiting on.|`|EwNrlF8jaa	These days people are not rushing in to marriages and many opt to just live together. Thats a personel issue and unless some one has a man for her to marry then they should stay out of it!!|`|FnskUYpqaa	35|`|2b0812b5f0b805dbd0a14b215181713daa	Things are pretty lax anymore. people used to assume that by mid twenties, a woman should be married. I think people in general are not rushing into marriage so much anymore, and more woman are interested in establishing themselves before they get married.... go to college and find a good job... if love happens along the way, so be it. Alot of women are not so much worried about the "correctness" of things   college, job, marriage, kids in that order, unless theres religion in the picture. My feeling is that people (men and women) live in the moment and do things when its right. I'll be 32 when i get married. We've been together for 8 years, and have three kids together. We always knew we would be together, but there was things that got in the way of us being married. it's the right time now.      In general, there isn't an age i would look at someone and ask why isn't she married. you never know the choices they've made to chose to be married at all.|`|QenW1Ok7aa	I only wonder "Why isn't she married?" when it's some self proclaimed Virgin! who is over 25, and 'saving herself' for marriage-I've actually known a few women like this in my life, who weren't ugly, and didn't seem to be lesbians, or survivors of childhood abuse....     One person who doesn't proclaim herself a virgin, yet still mystifies me for not being married yet is Tyra Banks- she is the same age as myself, and hell, if I looked like Tyra, I can guarantee you that I would have married and divorced at least twice by now- there are handsome and filthy rich single men all over the world who would surely be open to the thought! NONE of the men who have come on to her for the past twenty years has made it to 'husband material' yet???? I just don't get it.    I love your sidenote though- that is classic :)|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	At age 40.

Nothing's wrong with that, don't get me wrong, but usually *most* women either are married or had been married by about age 30. So I would wonder, but not necessarily in a bad way.    P.S. Your cousin just has a sense of humor, that's all.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Absolutely none... truly!  Yeah, it's funny about the spinster thing -- it was on the document we signed at church after we were married - it's the last time you sign your maiden name, and under it, is 'spinster'. Yes, definitely not the same connotation as 'bachelor'!!!|`|FtBHXQvHaa	35-40
bibIAhN9aa	no, having the film 'kids' doesnt make him a pedo.   I pedophile is someone who is sexually attractive to prepubesant children. You were 16 and the kids in 'kids' are pubesant, so even if he found the sexually attractive it would be technically wrong to describe him as a pedo.|`|TUqu6Hkaaa	humm maybe.|`|c5deea9b564cacc817ec7a632efba1beaa	Probably was, and he had his way with you.    Your mother must be an idiot. What logical person would let their 16 old child date a man close to 30. Legal yes, but morally right no.    I'm guessing you don't have a father in your life.|`|YKhzyT8Raa	He is definitely a paedophile.  I really don't understand why your mother didn't object to you going out with him, I would have done if I was her.   I'm 16 and I would never go out with a 28 year old. I'm barely an adult and there is a HUGE age gap.|`|7f9556755f69705a513723fb306b1046aa	For God's sake report this guy to the police right now,  even if you make an anonymous phone call from a pay phone.  Some kids might get hurt and if you're wrong after all no harm's been done.  Kids need responsible adults to protect them and it's better to be wrong than to let somebody's baby suffer.

43qzqfLnaa	I went through some issues like yours in the past in a previous marriage. Yes, the counseling can and will help you both learn some positive ways in dealing with the issues in a better manner. You have to remember that the only way that it will and can help is if you both want to take the advise given and if you both think and feel that a counselor will help. If it is just one of you who wants it, then it may not work as well as you hope. I hope that everything goes well for you both. Communication is so important in any relationship.    One thing that I know has helped me in the past is to try to present as much as possible in a manner that my wife or S/O was not made to feel like I was accusing or attacking her in any issue that I brought up, and the same in return. Once an issue makes a person feel like they are defending them-self, it is hard to get them to relax and talk calmly.  Finding a way to keep cooler heads will always lead to solved issues and less heated arguments. Best of luck to you both!|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Counseling may help with your communication, but I think it starts with wanting to like each other.    As far as going out, I think you should afford yourself at least once, maybe twice a week to have dinner with a friend, no kids.    Marriage is about two people making a life together, not a husband being a television husband and a wife being a television wife.  Live your lives like you mean it.|`|XTBlOf9baa	This is the best time to go to counseling. If only more people had the same mindset as you. Really, which would you rather do. Go to marriage counseling now to deal with one minor issue, or go to counseling in a few years when that one minor issue has snowballed into several major issues? Or go to marriage counseling now for a few sessions for a few months, or go to marriage counseling in a few years for weekly marriage counseling sessions for a year or two to resolve all those issues? It's an easy choice! It's so much better to just address those minor issues right away, rather than run the risk of letting that one issue turn into several more issues. Poor communication can easily lead to larger issues if the two of you let it. You're doing the smart thing by going now to deal with it right away. Too many people refuse to go to marriage counseling over minor issues like this, they snowball into major issues, then they sit there and refuse to go to marriage counseling, saying "marriage counseling won't help us with our problems."|`|c73c9fc0da3874e1d4faac4608c7b448aa	well, men are happy and like to have fun..  women are unhappy and like to cause misery.    it is just life|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	Ok, I had the very same situation with my husband for the whole 2 years.When i read your question,its like you were writing for me. I come from a very well educated family, none ever raised the voice, cursed or fought, really, so, for me to have my husband yell at me, belittle me, and tell me to: "pack up my **** and leave" each time i wantd to discus and issue, was a big and very depressing.  How he changed: THis may sound weird, but i swear this is true. I talked to the psychic, and she cleansed our Aura,and released us from bad energy.She said that basically, from bad energy, he wasnt really himself. Its been 5 months since then, i look at him and i cannot believe how he`s changed,like i now yell sometimes, i am the one that doesnt talk to him and he comes to me first..and he doesnt get mad anymore, we talk normaly..i still cannot believe it.   I didnt wanna do counseling-cuz man tent to think-Oh who is he/she to tell me what is wrong with my marriage and stuff.  So, if you wanna give it a try with this psychic, i can give you her number, you can do it through th phone, she is really amazing, she workes with celebrities to ;  I would anything for my marriage.So...|`|k73IxCHaaa	It sounds like you two are very emotional people, but more importantly he sounds a little irresponsible. A marriage counselor can teach you how to communicate with one another, but the behavioral issues seem to be the root cause of your disagreements. This is something a marriage counselor is not equipped to handle.    Change in behavior must start with the person involved, identifying the behavior, wanting to change the behavior and eventually executing the change in behavior. In other words your husband needs to grow up and accept his responsibilities as a husband and a father, no amount of marriage counseling in the world is going to change that. He must be willing to change if the marriage is to survive.
Y8iZ30CKaa	Sounds like someone likes her as more than a friend. If you and her are as close as you say you are or were then you should have no problem in asking her if everything is okay. Just tell her how you feel. My best guy friend was really jealous and just today he pulled me aside and told me that it seemed like i didn't care anymore. I felt like he hadn't made any effort towards our friendship so i didn't talk to him very much. We talked it out and now we are fine. If we would have talked to each other sooner about it then it would have gotten resolved sooner. It was just a misunderstanding and that's probably what yours is too. Just ask her, and tell her.    Good Luck!|`|f5dea284379af3a6407e885474f0b38baa	she could just be busy with school and you know boyfrineds are a big thing to take care of especially relationships why dont u say lets grab a bite to eat or take a walk or soemthing jsut to talk to her if shes a good friend she will understand. You can confront her directly.. and u may in fact be putting in all the effort and if so shes just not a good frined.. sometimes girls get tangled up in boys after they start going out with them... good luck|`|IPDAG6vyaa	as much as you dont want to talk to her, you just have to. sit her down and let her know what you're feeling. you're not always going to get the 50/50 effort in friendships. sometimes, you just have to go out of your way. thats what friends are for.   there will always be a reason as to why you two have been growing apart. maybe its from her side but whatever it is, you have to talk and find out whats wrong in order to keep your friendship. if she doesnt talk to you about things then dont feel bad, you'll have the satisfaction that you've done your best and it is on her. you'll never know until you ask.|`|faa23f4368704769d71cc29e72525163aa	I have almost the exact same situation.

Zu4PLS7kaa	Well normally I would say violence is wrong.... but sometimes if that's what you gotta do, then do it. I wasn't there so I don't know how it should have been handled. I would say good job!    I too have had that experience. Except I only scratched a kid. Then I got an in school suspension. It really wasn't that bad though, more like a study hall than anything.

But I'm sure that there's guys out there that would.|`|Ju17SFm3aa	lol im not a guy    Answer Mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|lHzBJA4eaa	I know tons of guys that date only women with kids. They love the ex's house and money .|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Maybe, but I'd be kinda torn.  I mean, I love kids. They're innocence and playfulness is just so great, but I couldn't see myself with more than two.  I guess if the woman was kind enough I'd be a little more inclined to reconsider.   :]
IuIp7Eevaa	tell him to respect your boundarys, he is making you uncomfortable|`|bFOqf40zaa	red?|`|PUXmTrnMaa	You said you have had sex with him so obviously your having a sexual relationship. I would be confused by your behavior also. Telling him you have a headache rather than the real reason you don't want to have sex is not a good start to building a trusting relationship with strong communication. Think about it.|`|tjGFRs1Kaa	If he really cared about you and respected you, he wouldn't be pushy about sex when you said no.|`|TQ8Hbiv9aa	Men feel rejected when u dont want to have sex with them. It makes them feel unwanted. What he is saying is true though. He does have needs. You just have to let him know how you feel and be as honest with him as you can. Don't assume he understands you, you have to be as specific as possible. Talk things out, make an agreement or something like that so both of you know what to expect.....|`|7yrdcqY1aa	well you need to make compromises in a relationship and you should talk about how many times both of you would be comfortable doing it in like say a week|`|PyC1MIkXaa	Just put your foot down and say you don't want sex at times. He can't force you to have sex with him. Besides, you don't want a boyfriend who can't respect your decisions.|`|eHrvVMZjaa	tell him that|`|sfJp4QNJaa	You are not obliged to have sex if you don't feel like it. Tell him this and then state the obvious that if he loves you he will understand and be patient. Oh, and then reassure him that you do love him.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Sex relieves headaches, so that excuse never works.    Why would he even try to persuade you by saying he'll be quick?  Is that supposed to work?  He'll be the laughing stock of his friends if they hear about that one.    Sometimes people just don't have matching sex drives.  That gives him no reason to cheat though.  It may mean you break up at some point.  He does sound a bit immature (and premature).|`|01pY6dW9aa	He is being immature.|`|oldKepHXaa	He must be bad in bed.:Joke..  Maybe he really doesn't love you. If he did he'd wait for you But i bet your afraid that if you don't sleep with him then you'll just loose him huh? Well, this is the ultimate test to see if hes really for you! Relationships aren't about sex at all its about love and trust.Yes, affection but only when its wanted and Mutual. But what if he gets tired of waiting then get IT from someone else..Then you really know hes not for you tell him to respect you.|`|KlSjISoQaa	be clear, confident and direct in telling him you are not ready. He knows you're not ready but he is and will make you feel guilty. He also knows you love him and will use that to his advantage to force you to have sex with him. YOU MUST tell him you're not ready, if he keeps pressuring you then obviously he doesn't love you in a health good way and just wants sex and doesn't care for your feelings. I'm sure if it was the other way round you would act like he does right.|`|ELdvVLJJaa	this is what you do....  *runs away with 2 points*|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	tell him you have decided to go abstinince from now on untill your married because you learned that having sex before marriage is wrong even if you dont believe it|`|3IJOMiduaa	if my gf would say that she did'nt want to have sex she would give me a good reason for it. maybe thats what you should do|`|e1F55L7aaa	Be yourself. If you don't want to have sex then don't. BUT i will say this guys are prone to be more sex orinted..and maybe you just need to give in every once in awile. If you don't want sex don't lie and say you have a headache tell him the truth. Your just not in the mood. He needs to find a diffrent way to turn you on becuase it seems like he isn't turning you on.|`|SfDsq7Soaa	start having more sex. guys are sexual so if ya wana keep the guy and have already had sex you need to have it a few times a week atleast to keep him in check|`|QCjOcME6aa	If you gonna be in a Relationship from my point of view I think you will have to face some problems in life. And he will just Bail out. Its better you end this relationship here. Because you wont be respected in his eyes.|`|9zZxHSHQaa	k look. honestly when a guy tells you, oh you dont wanna have sex with me because you dont love me, thats seriously such a pathetic excuse. dont fall for that. & if he cant respect your boundaries, then why are you gonna respect his needs. i mean you said you already did it with him a few times and yea like you are his girlfriend and you are allowed to have "fun" sometimes. but your lucky hes not cheating. if he loves you and your a little insecure about it that and really dont know if hes faithful or loyal and you think he just wants sex and is gonna leave you later. then you should really consider making sure you DO know that he really loves you.|`|mjVQx1THaa	tell him your limits and tell him how you feel.  if he gets upset that means he doesn't respect you and your body.  and if he doesn't respect you all he wants is sex.  if you tell him how u feel and he continues to do it..  dump him.    hope this helps and goodluck!|`|KEjhB8qpaa	tell him  you will do what u want cuz ur a grown woman n if you dont want to then he will have 2 get over it.|`|3lvcWg0Kaa	Yeah i have read what you are all saying and you all make good points but as a man and some of you may think this is immature but after so long he is going to start looking for it some where else.|`|jnqc2BZGaa	OOOOkay!  i think that his hormones are taking over his entire thinking process!  u shouldnt feel pressured by him and dont fall for those guilt trips!  he's just trying to get into your pants...&&&& if your not in the mood or ready dont do it!  it lowers your self esteem.|`|5k9NWD0aaa	Honestly, it seems that you two are probably sexually incompatible.  Sex is a huge part of relationships.  (it's probably the main reason young men are even in a relationship)  If it is becoming a sticking point, you two should probably break up.  That way he can find a woman who he is more compatible with and you can find someone who is compatible with you.  If you don't wanna break up, there has to be a compromise somewhere...discuss and find it.|`|7LjzmNzRaa	no dont have sex with him|`|yfYOScbqaa	Tell him he can't have it.|`|kMmyPDTLaa	just tell him your on your PERIOD.. he wont touch you for a week! :) haha jk!!     just .. tell him that relationships aren't just about sex! love isn't about just sex... tell him if HE really loved you, he'd understand you...  explain to him what you really feel..  be honest... dont be scared!..  good luck!
AA10272424	Talking to her friend is one thing but as soon as others came around she should have stopped. The friends brother was drunk & probably thought he was being funny. The next time she talks to her friend about very personal things she needs to show a bit more discretion & keep it between them .. not others who may be around. You do have reason to be angry & you did the right thing by NOT messing him up. That wouldnt have solved anything.|`|lf5ZXo9Eaa	He was joking around (plus, add the drinking to the factor and he probably thought he was being funny).  No need to overreact,  from what it sounds like he didn't mean it in a disrespectful way to you or toyour wife or anything, he was just joking about something he overheard her talk about-and you were completely right to leave the situation without physically hurting the guy.  Choose your battles in life wisely, because they all come with consequences.  Sometimes it's just better to walk away.|`|jRxojwaBaa	Overreacting a tad--- just tell your wife that you didn't appreciate her discussing your love life with another man. She would be furious if another woman were to come up and say that to her. Just tell her that you understand it wasn't her fault that he came in... but next time be a little more aware of her surroundings.|`|ACc1skbPaa	I think you should ask your wife not to talk about personal things with people you don't know and that if she chooses to share things about her life with her friends to do so discreetly and not out in the open in front of you or others that may be embarassed...I am glad you decided against "f**king him" up as I don't know what the hell that would prove or how that would fix anything whether there are kids home or not...drinking sometimes leads to bad behavior, ask your wife to keep things about you private and let the rest go...|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Nothing, it's not that big a deal.|`|yDKHatBxaa	he probably didnt mean to affend you...but he should have realised it was inappropriate. you could have been a bit calmer but u just reacted to how u felt.
V2IGDBHIaa	He might have been trying to flirt and was hurt by your comment, or he is a jerk. If you get the vibe that he likes you, he might have been offended. Or he may have just wanted you to try and convince him to play again. Guys like attention. Good luck with that.|`|NYrEP8Ceaa	i think he was having fun, and could possibly be interested but got offended when you said that, you should just let him no you were just flirting back with him because than he might really show hes into you once he knows he wasn't already rejected. goodluck =]|`|yL5qYog7aa	At first, it seems like he was trying to flirt, but by the end of your story it's clear he's a bit of a jerk. Or was at least certainly acting like it at this party. Getting offended because you responded playfully (I'm assuming) and didn't immediately jump his bones or whatever is just sleazy.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	he was flirting|`|1ZwI8ePdaa	lol to the myspace reply, kinda desperate?    it's kind of weird, if i was flirting with a girl then i wouldnt do anything that might make her sorta sad, maybe he was just confused?    give him a text n ask him if he wants to do something soon, everyone loves a ranomd text :)|`|Wj5QBGnNaa	No, i don't think so D:|`|rjzVYKI2aa	Ouch thats a tough one he probably was offended because he probably does like you, but to me thats really immature to just stomp away when you were pretty much just trying to make yourself not look like an *** so I wouldn't put to much thought into it, thats kinda bogus haha.|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	yea he was lol|`|tN6JA7IQaa	He sounds like he likes you, but it's a little immature that he reacted the way he did to your teasing. Not sure. D: Try talking to him more but if he keeps acting like a jerk then leave him alone.|`|AA12115728	That was a stupid thing to get offended about.  I'm guessing that he probably didn't know what he was doing, and your comment offered him a convenient bail-out.  He probably likes you, though.
1MUCS9wGaa	lex...xsey...x...lexi....lexsey sexy...|`|AA11945637	sexless|`|vtototRlaa	sexy lexsey lmao idk
96ZfDF6Aaa	You are way off the mark.  Its fine.  He's a baby and unless she's a pedophile its not a problem and is helpful to her mom.  I bathe my step-son.  Does that make me a pedophile or a good mom?      Now if the child was old enough to bathe himself, then yes that would be a problem, whether it be a sibling or a parent.    She's helping to raise him, as older children should do in a family.  I hope you haven't been saying this stuff to her or anyone she knows.  You have the problem, not her.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	no it is ok to do her brother is only 1 year old it is nothing|`|gufsKklSaa	i think u need 2 get ur head outta the gutter...the little boy is only a yr old..y wood this lead to incest later!?..u r over exaggerating obviously...just don't worry bout it...|`|z9uCBsmxaa	Oh grow up.  He's an infant.  Do you think it might lead to incest when your MOTHER bathes him?  What's the difference.|`|VOLRhthLaa	Nothing at all wrong with bathing her brother who is one. Only a sicko would suppose this could lead to incest. Of course she would not be bathing him when he is old enough to bathe himself. She is probably helping her Mom by bathing him.|`|QXLO2fzIaa	I guess it all depends on who you ask. I don't think it's weird because her brother is only one. He's still a baby! I know many people who bathe their children together when they are younger. Of course as they grow older they stop but I don't see anything wrong with it.|`|Gu856ETGaa	It's not weird....he's just a baby. It's not sexual or leading toward incest or anything, the kid just needs a bath and he can't do it himself.
kXPmr9oDaa	no. maybe a kiss on the cheek, but lips too far unless she/he wants to|`|CwAhC38Uaa	I wouldn't, normaly it's better to do it on like, the second or third date. Trust me, it stuns the guy most of the time and gets really uncomfortable for the rest of the date. The first date is just getting it over with, the second date is getting to know him, and the third date is when you make the move.|`|OFR9DVQUaa	nope, save it. kissing lets a person in really fast, and the first date is not the best time to do that, even if you know that person already. you see people differently after you kiss, and if you decide not to continue going out, it's easier to be friends if you don't.|`|OvBbmaksaa	it depends..if the two of you are fine with it. but, to be safe, know first if theres really something going on between the two of you. goodluck :]|`|YZQW0X92aa	sure if the other person is comfortable with it|`|PiaDOVXlaa	kissing on the first day is not really bad except the individual have different intend|`|QImt8GtSaa	bang on the first date!|`|HTSLBPE2aa	Yes I would if things clicked well, I'm game for it.|`|RbENcBj6aa	yeah.. it depends...l0l|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Thumbs up. High Five.  Kudos.  Let The Band Play.  Run N Circles.  Swing from the chandelier.  Yes!|`|gqvvXknQaa	Yes! I'm all for it.|`|v7GH7ulgaa	go for it!|`|5r48jn7iaa	yes|`|CgaQHgZLaa	yes|`|UVb2a1BZaa	Kissing? Heck no... you probably shouldn't even be having sex.
AA11312653	A thank you message should be handwritten and personal. That means you mention the gift and what you like about it.    Dear Virg & Mary,  Your towel set/blender/vase/comforter really adds beauty/convenience/sophistication/elegan... to our   bath/kitchen/living room/bedroom.

Sincerely, Janet Majors    The word with the dots is supposed to be "elegance" but Yahoo is messing with me tonight. Congrats & best wishes.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	first of all congrats to you! secondly always mention the gift - let people know that you really appreciated the item they sent.  the generic "thank you for the gift" isn't very friendly or thoughtful so take that extra moment to make them feel like you really did love that vase or whatever they sent!  ===============  dear auntie sue  thank you so much for the gorgeous vase. it will look beautiful sitting on the desk in the front foyer.  i missed seeing you at the wedding and we are looking forward to having you over for tea once we are settled into our new life.  hugs and kisses  ========================  dear carl  we were sorry you couldn't make the wedding, but do thank you so much for the very generous cheque.  here is a photo of the two of us in all our finery!  we hope you will stop by soon for a visit!  love  ========================  dear lucy  wasn't it the most dreadful storm? we felt so bad that your flight was cancelled and you didn't make the wedding. your gift is perfect. i can't believe you found a quilt with our colors in it.  its a beautiful gift and we thank you for it.  we hope to be up your way in the spring and will phone ahead to see if you would like some company!  take good care til then  love   =======================|`|EYtUNXnKaa	This is exactly what it should say,   To Mr. and Mrs. -----      thank you so much for not becoming an antelope, or steeling my candy. i understand that it was a full moon and it was very difficult for you. the dead goat you brought me was wondeful. thankyou so much for coming.|`|cGbTJobeaa	For the people who sent gift but couldn't make it to my wedding, I thanked them for the gift and I told them a couple of details about the wedding day and I said that I hoped to catch up with them at some point in the future.
3TLuSf9Yaa	You will do just fine but hard to get back into the swing of things, it'll be a new journey. I know some great guys. Time to hop off the bus Gus, making new plans Stan, don't need to be coy Roy...just set yourself free:)|`|aEpPt9koaa	I don't know. Everyone is different. Are you ready to start dating? Time wise, yes three years is long enough but emotionally I can't tell you if your ready. Only you can answer that.|`|AA10436595	Yes three years is about long enough!!  Get out there and pick a good one this time.  Good luck!|`|C0i3t4graa	however long it takes. go for it.|`|t9htoO50aa	If you can let go of the past and move on then yes. Remember you are starting new. Don't bring up your ex when dating someone new or things from your past marriage. Good luck and God bless you.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Should be. Hopefully you had some counseling or at least a divorce group experience. It makes a major difference.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	You are older and wiser now, go have a ton of fun and don't fall for the same crap as before.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Yes go ahead and have fun.  Something better will come, that usually the case.|`|d08c2ff1d2c6a46f4309339f29ed68c4aa	So start dating.|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Wow three years,,,your toys must be exhusted....about time go for it.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Go get back on the horse!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	About bloody time! go for it.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	3 years since you dated? go find some one. just make sure they don't have any hang ups. good luck. ps. try the computer date thing, you can get to no lots of people that way. i met my wife of almost 5 years that way. need more advice? let me know. i like sharing life experience with people.|`|UVb2a1BZaa	It's not the time, it's the mind and soul.  Are you really ready?  Then decide what it is you want from dating, companionship, companionship and sex, just sex, or ready to find someone to move forward with.   But know this before you start dating.... then go for it.|`|ghmwZtFraa	I think it really depends on you. If you feel you are ready to put yourself back out there. But I understand how it can be really hard to move on if you really loved the person you were married to.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	YES!  Yay you!!  have fun!  Good luck and BE VERY PICKY!!|`|aY5vHbPLaa	I think you just answered your own question.<br>  Have Fun, Be Safe, and be Picky!|`|ygimTNzoaa	I go on Craigslist personals, theres TONS of guys on there, and you dont have to put up with a WHOLE date if they seem like a loser, you find out what you want by E-mail first. Easy! Good luck.|`|mggll8dRaa	It Depends on the Individual....!!
5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	What are you doing in bed with your boyfriend in the first place?  You're not married.  Get out of bed and start wowing him in the kitchen with his favorite dessert.  The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  The only thing I would help him "finish" is that delicious pie you're going to make for him.|`|X4U36dHzaa	it's made when you drool,it's feels better,how about just licking the knob,bring out the karma sutra book, if you dont want to put in the effort he will find someone else that will.wear some lingerie an play with yourself in front of him,that's a big turn on,i can sit here day and give you pointers,maybe grab his tool and grind against your P*&%$,it works for me!go hard or go home!|`|PwOgrFk9aa	Use your hands as well.  When your mouth starts to get tired, just back ur face up a bit but still stay close to it.  Use your hands to massage the shaft and gently play with the scrotum.  I never bring it to a finish in my mouth.  Right before, I go back to using my hands.    As for him finding you irresistable/ spicing it up...you don't need to dress up.  Talk dirty.  Role play.  Tie each other up.  Lick stuff off each other.  Try new positions.  Any and everything that you guys can think of or have read in a magazine or seen on TV, just give it a go.  Being open to more things will definitely help.  But if you don't try, you will just stay boring, girlie.|`|xXWSpw5Saa	wear just ur undies to be....
1901bfd7e5d77621c6f81617c4073a1eaa	arron your a dumass    he likes you. would he hate you if he glanced at you? play with your hair? if he didnt like you, why would he be hitting on you (trying to make you laugh, etc.) the locker thing could be a conincidence. could beyou, or he could just be walking to a water fountain or his friends locker before class. either way, hes into you. enjoy it!|`|mpUsNchQaa	idk|`|fyyfPEemaa	well i have the same prob. with 2 guys..too and yeah.. they like me..so i'm guessing he likes you too... :)     it gets annoying at times huh? lol|`|qjuqSq7Gaa	http://www.myspace.com/wut_it_do_357    add me|`|NDju3p0Raa	he likes u but idk if u wanna get with him|`|MQVmh5hiaa	Yes I think that he does like you. But you never know for sure because sometimes they are unpredictable.|`|V2IGDBHIaa	He could be just trying to flirt and get your attention and doesn't know how to do it. It could've been the way he came up with to get your attention. If you feel really bad about it, you could always apologize. But playing with your hair, I would say it's something guys do when they like you. Good luck.|`|esMek8nWaa	JELLY BEASN!|`|Qh5Pollvaa	Try and flirt more and more and see if it goes anywhere, try and talk to him more!!    It sounds to me like he fancys you but he doesnt know how to show you so he goes with his instincts by trying to make you laugh and trying to see you.    Try and find out because you never know     ^-^|`|bjqyM4yBaa	he likes you   he just doesnt know how to flirt well|`|7FjB8FfXaa	umm.. i think he likes you a little but now he knows you don't like him back. do u like him or not..|`|IULvTad8aa	You should ask him if he's interested. But most likely he is flirting b/c playing in your hair, and trying to make you laugh, and he is staring @ you are signs that he likes you.|`|vDPCNimoaa	haha wow, not much people here are helpful huh? yes i think he likes you. the only reason he probably stares at u is cuz ur hot. he's probably not an '***', i guess hes jus tryin to get your attention.|`|xeeQ9QkLaa	ohmygod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  teenagegirlswhotalkreallyfastand  don'tmakealotofsense  oruseproperpunctuation  reallymakeithardtoanswertheirquestion?...  ??????|`|TYgQHhThaa	i think he is trying to tell you something but he sounds like a stalker to and weird but its cute in some way|`|517I1VWMaa	He's not the one.|`|zU1hrRIgaa	typo!     "and ***"|`|akta3gq7aa	MEXICAN JUMPING BEANS >:D|`|nYntQhBoaa	i think he likes you|`|u6EJnaVpaa	If he was trying to beat you would know it from day one because people don't become cute over night|`|EUIqaMK2aa	when you talked more he could have been making that he liked you obvious but maybe now hes seeing how you would react if he didnt talk to you as much|`|sxKjYyXsaa	Well, these show true signs of him having a crush on you. Though, it all depends on the guy. Is this something that he does to a bunch of other people, or is it just you?    If it is just you, consider him to be crushing on you.    Sometimes, guys may not like a girl, but they annoy them to see their reactions. Do you make big reactions?    See how he reacts to the things you do, and monitor how you react as well. If what you do affects how he acts, then he most likely likes you.|`|TxecTL1aaa	he really likes you and since valentines day is coming you should get him something and maybe he'll get you something back. the hair thing was weird and romantic at the same time so ya he really likes you i bet. first of all is he cute is he nice and good personality he seems good to me.  glad i could help|`|51Q5uvpKaa	well i think that he does and i think he realizes that you are starting to notice so now it is a wierd but a good kinda weird. ask him out|`|ZSQfH6f7aa	Ok, honestly...did you just post up this question to have a bunch of people tell you that a boy likes you? It's so obvious, Jelly!!!     If you like him back, go for it, if you don't..just try not to lead him on. It sounds like a crush, and it will probably pass as most school crushes do.
lckv4hs3aa	This isn't the norm, but it's not unheard off or 'bad' whats she's doing. Just do what feels right to you and go with the flow. When i was younger and first started dating (17ish) i would just date loads of guys non-exclusively etc for a couple of years. Even was seeing up to 8 guys at once one time (didn't sleep with any tho) :S than i decided to have a break from guys, met a great guy and dated him exclusively from the start and been going out 2 and bit years now. I didn't plan to date loads of guys and was looking for a boyfriend at the time, but it just happened and  wouldn't take it back for anything now in hindsight, was a lot of fun. But i personally prefer being with just the one guy. My point is just go with the flow, if you meet a guy and have a really good connection and wnt to sleep with him, than i say do it. Just do what feels right.|`|ugCp0krVaa	Your co-worker is doing what she thinks is okay for her, and that is normal for her.  To me dating is to go out and have fun and get to know someone.  There are good guys out there who want to meet a girl that does not sleep with everyone they meet. There is noting wrong with waiting to get to know the person before you sleep with them.  You follow your own mind and a little old fashion is not a bad thing. Remember there is a lot of STD'S out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11506593	I think you're coworker is either (1) lying, or (2) attempting to compensate for getting older by living recklessly.<br>  <br>  If all you want out of a man is sex and all the complications (disease, pregnancy, etc) it brings, then that is your choice. But if you are looking for a man that you can have a long-term healthy relationship with, hold on to your "goodies" for a few months while you get to know him better.|`|4xJmT6n0aa	I believe you should have one serious partner and then wait until you know you love him before you start sleeping with them|`|w9mrFRJ2aa	Um, yeah thats normal, for a girl who is.........ehem......a slut.  But there are people who would argue against my judgement.  I don't find that attractive in a girl at all.  And I can guarantee you that if 1 of those 3 men knew she was sleeping with 3 guys, they wouldn't be sleeping with her no more.|`|ZTs2tFHFaa	ahaha. that just means she's easy.<br>  don't listen to her because guys like a challenge and a ladie that respects her self.<br>  <br>  if you give it up within a date or two he'll leave.<br>  <br>  so just wait until you really know the guy|`|VlypxvIdaa	i dont think what shes doing is normal. you should definitly get to know the guy first and have a lots of dates before you sleep with them.|`|UVb2a1BZaa	Well, she's 50 and old...... so she needs to get pleasure as quickly and often as she can before she croaks.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	I would not have sex with a guy after the second date.|`|QImt8GtSaa	i think you should eat a taco. that will fix it.|`|RJeucPf9aa	No that is not normal.You are correct about more than two dates. Because giving it up after two date tells the guy your easy. And if he wants to be with you and has any feelings for you then that is going to take time.And also playing hard to get has work for many women. This will let you know what type of guy he is and how he acts. Because some guys out there are very sweet and loving until down the road years later he is a demanding, very controlling and obnotious person you no longer want to be with. So no i would have to say friend, co-worker or not. She is wrong.|`|n2P9vD1eaa	At the age of 50, many people loose faith in love. They've become bitter, and feel that the world is not a place for the old time romances. My bet is that she's been burned too many times. Myself, I'm still hoping to find the love of my life. I have never slept with anyone I wasn't with for a long time before hand. I think that sex should be something meaningful, after all, your body is important, and should only be given away with great care. That kind of thinking can definitely work today, you've just go to find the one you want to be with.<br>  <br>  And just out of curiosity, how old are you to be working with a 50 year old and just starting the dating scene. Nothing wrong with starting late, I started when I was 18, but curiosity killed the cat...satisfaction brought him back.|`|Bh7J2tlzaa	More normal than I would like, I worked with a woman about 15 years older than me, she was in her 30's. She would give me a lift to and from work. <br>  In the space of two months she'd seen and slept with 4 guys.<br>  <br>  Not sure, maybe just an older women thing, feel like they're losing their youth so go out and do the craziest stuff.|`|02bjGeEUaa	everyone dates differently. dont let her tell you your way is outdated because its not. its called class and ur boss is a skank if she sleeps wit guys left and right......than agian maybe she is tryin to get all the sex she can before her time is up lol but ur young and have plenty of time so take ur time gettin to know guys if you want real relationships|`|1S5OPJH1aa	it is quite common. however there is no right or wrong live your life however you feel comfortable.<br>  <br>  if you want a nice steady realiable guy your not going to meet him sleeping around<br>  <br>  if you want lots of good fun and casual times your not going to find it without putting yourself out there.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Varies. Some people are still old fashioned and wait whereas others, particularly in that age bracket are fed up with messing around and just enjoy themselves. Using dating sites can lead to "serial dating" cos you never know how long any relationship is going to last, if at all.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Each person has different ideas, so just go with your own.
IupKCflBaa	he probably likes u, and I is trying to find a way to talk about you. When I personally like a girl I can't stop talking bad things about her to cover it up, or maybe he dosent want one of his friends to like u and he is trying to repel u in order to have you all to himself :D|`|oldKepHXaa	what did he say about you?|`|V2IGDBHIaa	He is not worth your time if he is going to be saying bad things behind your back.|`|da1Vqmbqaa	he cud of do u think he likes u back???
tNSGSxezaa	d boy has obviously never been in ur situation and this pu a tear to my eye because I was about tell my bestfriend I love her but if it ended like that It would end my heart. Thanks alot|`|UQsHk4gYaa	THAT WAS A SWET ONE LOL|`|JOankL0eaa	Shizh..you only put your arm around her..no big deal wtf...She seems to be over dramatic, I suggest you get away from here.|`|UtNhOcyPaa	try to talk to her either on the phone or in person  explain to her that you really do care about her and in no way want to "screw her over" and be a "Selfish jerk."   tell her that you feel like an idiot for making her feel uncomfortable and that yes, you do like her but if it means sacrificing your friendship then you will stop and just go back to being friends if possiable.  explain that you understand she's been hurt in the past by jerks and that she has every right to be mad at you.   tell her how you've been a mess and don't know what to do..|`|R9QeiB3waa	you don't eat milk! now..... do  you drink cookies?  you drink milk and eat cookies! ^_^|`|YJXwdGV5aa	Just give her a little space.  She's in a vulnerable place and when you push someone intentionally or unintentionally that tend to step out of your life. it just is a little awkward nothing personal. I know it may feel like the world is crashing down on you but this too shall pass.  The pain will pass and you'll have  a place in your heart for someone who sees you the way you see them. Hope this helps.|`|ubk21UBvaa	show her you're not a jerk    you cant just say it, apologize and take her out for dinner or to a movie, but just as friends.  and just act sweeter towards her|`|yGwda7wPaa	I say break the silence.  If there has been a couple of days, it is time to move forward.  Just be honest.  Let her know that you aren't just a selfish jerk wanting to hook up with her.  Tell her that even if all she wants as friendship, you are in, because you care about her...even if there is no sex involved.  Tell her that you admire her for more than just sex.  I think that might help.|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	move on no use of crying over spilled milk lol literally their is plenty of chicks out their|`|vTvsgVJiaa	I LOVE the attention grabbing question, that's awesome dude!!!    Anyway, first things first, get yourself some more cookies cuz that sounds awesome and I am jealous right now.  Ok, so now that the hunger thing is settled... write this girl a note.  Get her one single rose and a handwritten card that tells her that you are incredibly sorry and the last thing in the world you ever wanted to do is hurt her.  Tell her you care about her more than anything and you want a real relationship, you want to be there for her and spend every day making her happy, not being a selfish jerk and just trying to get into her pants.  Say you understand that she is upset but you promise to make it up to her if she will let you and all you want is to spend time with her.    NO mention of sex, and no trying to get into her pants until she is ready... a true sex addict would know that he just has to turn to porn until is girlfriend is ready for him anyway!!  Good luck and enjoy your cookies!|`|AA12115728	Okay, I'm not a Christian, but:  where did she get the idea that you are a selfish jerk?  Have you done anything to deserve that?  Sounds like she's dumping something on you that you do not deserve.    I would apologize to her, and tell her that you still want to be friends.  Assure her that you won't approach her like that again.  And leave it at that.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  Whatever caused her to react that way wasn't your fault.  I know this because she was your friend until you innocently put an arm around her, then you suddenly became a "selfish jerk."  If your friend was really such a great friend, she will understand and come back to you.  If she doesn't, find another friend.
SFWyiZyMaa	I feel the exact same way.    I'm not a college student, I'm 20 work at a fast food restaurant and have no plans to change what I'm doing because even if I did I would still be their puppet in this capitalist world no matter what job I had.    I know that the media emphasizes a lot like you said love, but they also emphasize alot on vanity and success.  It all seems as pointless as our existence and so does the American [nightmare] dream it's not for me either.    I'm glad that there are other people out there who feel the same way I do.  How I conquer the feeling is by burying myself in books and art.  I try to do things that I like and not let work get me down.  It sounds like you need some new sceneary.  Maybe you should live out on your own and chase after your own dreams and aspirations not your mother's.  =)     I wish you luck in this world full of madness and pain.|`|k0EIC2kaaa	I hear ya.    I just finished college myself and went through (and I'm still going through) the same kind of existential crisis. There's no absolute answer to life. Working the 9-5 grind seems like a pretty dauntingly mundane prospect, but once you've been working for a while you'll get used to it. The substance of the work will become more important to you - it will become meaningful to you over time. I know that sounds hard to believe on your way out of college, but if you look around there are a lot of happy people out there. You could become one of them . People change.    Really, it's a matter of accepting all the arbitrary things in world, and not questioning things that just are. Personally, I find it very hard to do this, and I find myself question what might be. But this kind of thinking is pointless and futile. Life and existence are arbitrary, nominal and have no 'objective meaning'. Objective meaning can't exist, by definition. So don't bother trying to find it. Accept that some things can be fun, even if you don't understand why.    What makes you so sure that you don't want to be in a relationship? If you've never tried a vanilla milkshake, how do you if you like it, or want it? The same might go for relationships. At the risk of sounding cheesy: There is no other feeling like love. I won't elaborate on that, but I think you should accept that there's a chance that it's true. It's one of the most primal emotions, and that's not really surprising from an evolutionary perspective, considering that we homosapiens have been monogamous creatures for a very long time indeed. It's no wonder there's an obsession with pairing up. It feels good. You should try it. Don't question what the point in feeling good is. Just accept it. It's the only way.    Hope that helps. And tell your mum where to stick it.    Edit: Actually don't tell your mum where to stick it, she's just trying to help, and might not understand what your going through. She might not even understand if you tell her everything. Just try to keep her happy without sacrificing your own contentment.|`|d1P05XfPaa	I agree with Ryan's comment.|`|QkKXX6igaa	well, we were kinda made to love and be loved, and thats just how it is.  don't worry about life though, because i promise that you are loved by someone and probably have just been blocking out your feelings, you'll give in.  and you can be happy with your self, nothing you do is gonna make the world come to an end, you know?  and love makes you happier than you could possibly imagine, so its just others wanting people to be happy.  you'll decide on something, and it will all be okay, lol-besides, we're all gonna die anyway.
YKhzyT8Raa	i think its really nice that you are saving it for marriage. It shows how devoted you are to each other.     ignore your friends, they will probably regret rushing into things. Your first time should be special.|`|R1oSxvyXaa	if i was you i wouldnt worry about it  people that talk like that  are going to regret what all they did   a few years down the road. when they  find someone they truely love and they  didnt save themselves for eachother.  dont worry about it, do what you feel is right|`|cjTsXS8raa	wanting to wait or not is purely a personal choice, if you are both Happy then that's all that matters.    For some people. especially younger people it becomes a way of proving how much of an adult they are to friends, most will regret their actions in years to come.|`|9qlpqEFKaa	i think you're decision to wait is great! i think it shows the strength of your relationship..and as for your friends, well that's immature!  every one is entitled to make their own decisions about how they intend to live their life! good for you i say! :)|`|5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	What people should be making a big deal about is why people are having sex outside of marriage.  It's common place for couple to have sex before marriage.  But does something common make it the right thing to do?  No, it doesn't.  I am saying something against pre-marital sex, yep.  In the minority?  I could care less.  A relationship carries with it tons more respect when the couple waits until AFTER their vows to consumate their now legitimate union for doing so.|`|AXbBz2BDaa	Girl, you need to know that sex is a really big deal because when you do it, it is a choice of commitment. If I were you, I would wait till you two got married.....|`|VgQkKd9Kaa	I think ur scared to lose ur virginity, n secondly if ur fiance is a virgin, neither of u would last but 5 mins in bed with eachother.  good luck.|`|df14a975e88aa3ace30d8ccaf12bf3e6aa	Not a big deal, If your a woman, dummy.  Most women can get laid in less then an hour if they want to. Much tougher for men, unless they pay for it.  Women want quality, men want quantity.  I knew a women who waited for marriage to have sex, she built it up so much, she was quite disappointed.   Ended up Divorced.  Most divorces are caused because people fought about either sex, or money. Believe it.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	my thoughts are your fiance is crap at satisfying you|`|bibIAhN9aa	humanbeings are sexual animals. Our drive to live is partly our drive to have sex. We are basically programmed to find food and shelter and then to have sex, its a basic human function and can be seen as a necessary human bodily function like breathing, eating and shitting. If we don't have sex the human race would die out.   This doesnt mean u have to have sex before you're married, but u can understand why its so important.|`|SQcwSG9baa	you are so right so what if you and your man want to wait why is every one so hung up about it its not good sleeping with every dirty man a girl can get her manicured fingers on its your decision good luck XD
7K98lSbpaa	you need to relax, find your inner peace, deep breaths. good now. you need to explain to lydia that you and nick are friends. that you like her as a friend and if nick asked you to do that to you you wouldn't do it. if she leaves you to find new friends then don't you don't have dwell on it. just move on because she wasn't a good friend. Now on nick you must let hm down gently. if he asks you why you didn't want to go out with him, then say that you didn't want for things to be akward after one of you dumps the other. but tell him thats its just for now. maybe later on a farther note. hope i helped.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	don't get involved ,make friends with someone else|`|8pw8qDjPaa	Drama drama drama    just stay out of it. honestly i'd stay away from nick for awhile cuz obviously he has issues and is probably just trying to hurt lydia.     be there for lydia. she needs you. comfort her and take her out to get her mind of things. the only thing that heals a broken heart is time, but keeping busy will help make time go by faster.|`|Ju17SFm3aa	No!No!No! dont be a backstabber pleae nick sound like a jerk!dont go out wit him      Answer Mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|9tYvYUEWaa	You don't have to choose sides, and it's selfish of your friend to making you do so.  Just tell her that your there for her, and perhaps will talk to this Nick guy about it.  Don't ever, ever pick sides unless the person is blood related, or best friend (and even then be skeptical).  That kinda thing.  But stick to your "no" answer for this Nick guy if your not interested.  Don't get pulled into the trap of being interested JUST because he is.  And the rest is up to you!
Pb4g2c3zaa	If you want someone to talk to, im a good listener. I swear im not a creep. talking online doesnt help as much as hearing a voice. if your feeling depressed email me and i can give you my  . I know exactly how you feel. been there.|`|AA10115609	Maybe you just aren't her type, it happens and it really sucks. You should be friends with her, better than nothing. Get to know her more.|`|h9AaGIYEaa	untill you've actually been rejected and gotten over it you will realise it was nothing and in two months you will be wondering why you even like her.   I say just be friends with her its better than nothing. Im 21 years old and a female so Ive been rejected and rejected boys before. If we say no just take it. We just may be to caught up to realise a good thing.  There are plenty of girls every where go to the mall or movies try talking to girls who dont go to school with you it kinda lets u keep a good rep with her regardless of your status at school.|`|UtNhOcyPaa	aww jet i'm sry. that stinks.    okay..well, depends what grade you are in hs as well as she but i'm just gonna assume ur in the same grade whatever that is (:    i think that you might want to consider the following:  1.) give her space to breathe and approach her at a later date    2.) go and talk to her somehow on either why she turned you down and would she consider just going on one date to get to know you?? (have you seen noah when he was young in the notebook?)    3.) tell her you've never felt this way about other girls and really like her: list why! (important-be honest in the list)    4.) go out in the world and meet new girls then.. "when one door closes, another one opens but sometimes we look at the closed door so much we fail to see the new one that has been opened for us" idk always liked that quote but have had a hard time believeing it too lol    good luck jet (:|`|YJXwdGV5aa	Oh the High School days.............. Sweetheart there will be more opportunities in life to have these feelings for someone else. It may not look like that now but it's true.  If it's too difficult to be her friend than don't. Give yourself time to heal so you can move on. To keep your mind off of it get involved in things that keep you occupied. Good luck|`|IPDAG6vyaa	its highschool. even girls in their 40s do things that no one understands!    dont pressure her and keep trying to get with her. that might only make her get annoyed and resent you. you can keep liking her but also remember that you got a whole life ahead of you. the worst thing is dwell on a girl and miss out of tons of other girls who could be perfect for you if you get to know them.     you are young, no sitting in sorrows and dont try to be her bestfriend just because she said you could be friends. give her some space. if she rejected you then space is the thing she wants the most. distance yourself and if she realizes that she made a mistake, (most girls do when they see the guys distancing themselves, girls are weird that way) she will come to you.    good luck.
ohwWCcNHaa	I know how that feels and im in a similar situation. My best advice is to try to be her friend and start spending more time with her. that way you can get to see if you really do like her based on how she makes you feel. if you still like her, take things slow and you may just change her mind!|`|j5V1zt9Maa	ok. you need to get over this. now.     youre a boy. boys are EXCELLENT at moving on real fast. you really like her, you went for it (brave, that was definitely brave), and the end result was that she didnt want a relationship with you.  she lost her shot.     if you tell her "you wont quit", that's only charming in movies. when girls turn down guys, it usually leads to an entire "omg what did i do, did i make the right choice? should i have? should i not have?!" etc session.     if you really feel like you can't get her out of your head (and i mean wait a little. a week. a few weeks. then see if you still cant get her out of your head) then try again. you could write her a cute note with a funny joke on the inside. if she still says no, man...she doesn't deserve you.     don't even think about sitting in your sorrows. i will find you and drag you to a carnival or something equally corny if you drown yourself in sorrows. i did that for a YEAR after my boyfriend dumped me. A YEAR. hell, he moved on the next day. who do you think benefited in the end?! i wasted so much time wishing that he would give me another chance and thinking about how perfect we'd be together. no.       waste of life. im a senior in high school now. and i know that there are bajillions of other people out there..who won't hurt me.   let  it  go|`|YN1lQLZWaa	Hmmm maybe she has a reason to say just friends.  Or Maybe she's hiding something and doesn't   wanna tell you. Try to talk to her and see  what she tells you..|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	KILLING SPREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    lol jks lets not do that alright?    get your mind off it it could come in due time just keep with it dont make her think your obsessed with her. maybe try and play some video games to get ur mind off it. i like to shoot stuff when im sad... or kick a football around at my local pitch with my mates anything that will get u out of this thing cause it can cause depression eventually happend t me... not fun at all...|`|c243d861e178b4d13e0a9682cd1bc9c9aa	she probably doesnt want a boyfriend right now or she is not attracted 2 u.You should ask her for the reason.Then just be her friend right now and she'll come around.You will know when she starts to like u and when you feel that way then ask her out.Dont force her to be ur gf.|`|aRDXTWIDaa	my boy friend had to ask me out three times before i said yes.  But before he asked the third time he made an extra effort to hang out in my group and be my friend.  I started to get feelings for him when i  got to know him better. try it out see if it works. :)|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Tread carefully.    Some may see this as stalking, and being stalked is an awful feeling.  What I can tell you is, tell her exactly how you feel. If she insists that friends is all you can be, then I suggest that is how you keep it, otherwise you risk losing your friendship with her as well.    On the other hand, congratulations for having the confidence to ask her anyway!|`|w6XOs6fEaa	well i think you should tell her exactly how you feel. honesty is key in every relationship. dont say the everyone likes you tho. i think you should do cute things to get her attention, lie write her a note, ora poem or give her a rose, or do something to lt her know you really like her.    hope things work otu XD|`|pwW7w8H9aa	1 thing, dont say fat, impolite. im not over weight just to let you know. Thing is your still a kid and seems like you need your manners adjusted. If you want to know ask her, you got the guts too as you have already asked her out already.|`|C1SFDyOhaa	take my advice,be friends with her,she may be feeling you out.by saying no to being more .still be careing thoughtful and you might just get lucky.I DID|`|WTDgqc1Naa	i think you shouldn't tell her that you won't quit liking her. tell her that you really like her and if she changes her mind to talk to you|`|sa13rnxgaa	Well,  Honestly im a girl.    I mean when i reject a guy.  I feel really bad about it.  Soo.my point is.I bet she feels bad about it...    Maybe,someday or soon she might  go back and ask yu out.  I mean if she doesn't atleast she  is still yur friend && still talks to yu.  I mean some girls/guys get wierd feelings  and stop talking to you if yu tell them yu liked/loved them.  At least i  hope she's not like that.    I probably confusing youu.  Hope i helped,|`|z9F6xmFzaa	awww :( i'm really sorry babes but it kinda sounds like her decisions been made...she said she wants to be friends...    definitely dont keep trying, this will only push her away. you need to let her see you moving on, flirting with other girls and having fun!    its a pity it turned out this way but you there will be other girls youll like, i promise|`|LFVeODxIaa	aww thats sweet Enjuli C.     lol i totaly agree with Enjuli and NEVER give up! lol if you like her that much then you should keep working. but dont tell her you are not giving up cuz that might be a little weird for her.

V2IGDBHIaa	Just ask her if she wants to hang out or do something together when you see her. And if you usually don't see her, make it happen, find a way to run into her if u must. Then just bring it up casually. If that can't happen then you could always just call her up and ask. It can be hard, but once that first step is over, gets easier. Sometimes when opportunities don't come when you want it, you need to create the opportunities. Good luck.|`|180rE9rGaa	yeah pus$y|`|ePYbjPThaa	that is exactly wat u should do. just simply say heyy u wanna hang out sometime this weekend. somethinglike that.:)|`|cblDE7M9aa	Okay...How about you text her to meet you somewhere in school and just ask her. It will make you look more serious about the date, then if you just text her. Good-Luck  Peace :P|`|eFgBTTVwaa	ok if u want to have a serious relationship, always do it in person.  and if ur that scared about it just talk it over with her before you ask
faa23f4368704769d71cc29e72525163aa	Being "together" should not have to be work ... all it is is a label for being best friendss, and being allowed to kiss eachother - and also being exclusive which it sounds like you guys are soo... you practically are bf and gf...    FWB is between two people who aren't really that close and have more of a physical relationship then a umm friendly friendship ... so a peck goodbye just emphasizes your friendly relationship its not solely about the "other" aspect.|`|t0uIgY08aa	not really friends with benefits... but close i guess|`|YfTMBFIIaa	It is boarderline.    You aren't fully making out or anything, but you are kissing.|`|eHyXQSuvaa	different people consider different things to be friends with benifits.  To me it doesnt really seem like ur friends with benifits unless u 2 hook up all the time|`|hPBnjOeDaa	Yeah, it's friends with benefits  its kind of a way to stay with someone, without the commitment    and theres nothing wrong with it, as long as you both know that you aren't dating|`|nfzhhbOaaa	I don't think so.  But that's just me.  I thought friends with benefits was when you have sex and stuff, but you're not really boyfriend and girlfriend...?  I really don't know, but from what I've heard, that's what it is.  OH!  Do you watch The Secret Life of the american Teenager?  Ricky and Adrianne? (Spell check on her name...?)  That's friends with benefits.|`|K0G3BZRwaa	To me there is no such thing.
830a86acc495e56c79b96209e023825eaa	yeah totally. I wish i would have had the guts to ask more girls out in high school, but i was always afraid of rejection. The girl i'm with now asked me out about a year and a half ago in the hallway of my apartment, and now i've asked her to marry me and she said YES!!! so it's definitely ok for the girl to ask a guy out. if you flirt with him enough he might ask you out too.|`|WdGI3QoOaa	go for it, but keep it simple|`|JOn6f7w3aa	it'd be fine|`|IUlIixJLaa	Definitely ask him out if you want to, who knows?|`|AA11368324	Why don't you invite him over for pizza and a good DVD movie?  That way, you're asking him out, without it looking like you are.|`|tHjrE2dVaa	Wow Ive always feared this from dating a gurl thats in all my classes. It may depends how comfortable you guys are. Like you meant get sick of seeing eachother that much and it meant not last but im sure you could make it work if you really like him.|`|laAZbxNVaa	flirt more, let him make the first move|`|5gn8q0R7aa	NO it wouldn't be to bad but if you broke up and sat by each other it would get really awkward.|`|mzIfJIQVaa	well if he doesnt like you then if you tell him i can see how that would be weird im having the same prob but people keep telling me that i will never know unless i try so... you will never know unless you try lol:D !!!!!!!|`|2Cvdu454aa	it isnt weird at all. go for it. the worst thing he can say is no, and honestly, it sounds stupid and childish but if that happens just turn around and say something like "god stupid i was joking"  that way it just takes the stress away from the situation  and hey, if he says yes you've scored!! :D   good luck hun  xo|`|dNPkZVPTaa	I'm sorry, but yes. Sometimes the best thing in a relationship is giving each other space. However, keep your friendly relationship strong, then, once summer hits, or when the next school year starts, go for it!    Good luck!|`|yIHlvPFfaa	totally go for it, a lot of guys actually liked to be asked out by a girl, i asked some guy out today, so dont be afraid, its nerve wracking but its worth it in the end even if you get rejected(i hate to say that but it happens to everybody), but dont be afraid to go for it, dont wait for him to ask you make the first move before its to late|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	like i think it is like not weird at all,and like i think like girls should like to like being more like agressive and this would like make shy men like come out of like their like shells. how do you like that.|`|5gBhIrQSaa	GEt to know him a little better, then do it [: go for it|`|Ly20pGC9aa	extremmly. i mean get real...your kinda friends? bs its not going to work.|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	one rule ...never go with the dudes friends ...Doesn't work ... hes too old now and if you were once Crazy about him ...that  man pride still is embedded into his character...|`|rceK0oglaa	no it wouldn't be weird at all in fact i incurage more girls to be like you|`|hPNhqsKmaa	NO just ask him it wont hurt|`|EtZ9NjHAaa	**** Yeah.

Really if u ask u can find out how he really feels about u.|`|q4T9xcEeaa	just keep flirting with him and after 2-3 days you should try to ask him out but don't be so nervous when asking him out|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	No. Love is strong and if you feel that's important then you should go for it. Just make sure you don't go to fast because then that would be weird. Just start out slow and buid your way up.|`|y4VWVD94aa	it depends. he could just be flirty. yes you can ask him out, there's nothing wrong with that. just make sure he likes you back in that way.|`|kpWvZ6Yxaa	no if he is flirting with you go for it!|`|nQ800xxTaa	It is not crazy  just be really nice about and when people say that guys make the first move is not true so go for and good luck|`|jGUcfW2qaa	Just do it.

7ouqu8f4aa	Take it from me, sex does not necessarily bring two people closer, it can actually even complicate things. Don't settle for less. If you can handle it, wait out for marriage. I regret my first time, and really wish I could have saved it for someone that I want to spend the rest of my life with.    Someone once told me that the whole point of waiting until marriage, is so on that one night, after the ceremony, you, as husband and wife, can embrace each other, and completely for the first time, give your heart, mind, soul, and body to one another. Which is the most beautiful gift you can give to the one you love.|`|tjeVygG5aa	well its your call. I would suggest atleast a little bit more time though. Just so the both of you know what it is you want. And if you see yourself being with him for the rest of your life and everything. If you have sex and breakup hes still gonna be apart of your life because you'll always remember and talk about the first time. then theres if you get pregnant or if yall stay together. Just make sure that you're doing it for the right reasons.|`|R1oSxvyXaa	dont do it  Wait|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You should not have sex unless you know you're ready. Think about what you want your first experience to be like. If you want it to be in the midst of a deep loving relationship then you should wait. 4 months is not enough time for that. If you really just want to have sex because you're curious maybe you might decide it's worth it. As for being "easy" or slutty, that is a silly double standard. Do it because you want to, not because you think you should.|`|9qlpqEFKaa	i don't know a lot on the subject as i haven't ever been in that situation how ever i think that if you Truly believe that you're ready to make that move and so is you're boyfriend then i don't see why you shouldn't go for it :) best of luck in any case|`|mo3HQCkYaa	If you have to post a question on Yahoo Answers, your definitely not ready.|`|KN8ikifHaa	I suggest that you wait, having sex won't make you guys closer, building a strong friendship will. Trust me you'll never regret it. I'm not saying that he's not a decent boy, but please don't feel like your missing out on something, cause if you sleep with him before you really get to know him well, and the relationship doesn't work, then you'll leave with regrets, and hurt feelings. Every guy after him you'll try to make that guy be everything that your ex lacked, and you'll punish yourself for not being able to change every guy that you meet, until your 32 years old, have been through a sting of losers, and now you finally found a man that is worthy of you. Oh wait!!! That's my life.|`|niRutVEXaa	don't do it !! wait a while if he cant wait !!! he dosent really like u|`|r64eBg1haa	well you should`nt have sex until your ready and if your not sure than you should`nt because sometimes you`re so called bf just ants you for sex and then you end up with the broken heart
dV3O2NWOaa	Maybe you should just tell her to be careful and notice how he acts around other girls. But don't go telling her because the guy might not be flirting on purpose. So let her figure it out but just warn her.|`|jnqc2BZGaa	yeah i think u should tell her.  your friend has a right to be informed, besides just let her know whats going on or at least drop some kind of hints to help her figure a out a solution, its worse if she found that you were keeping it from her. TRUST MY FRIENDS DID THE SAME THING.|`|5sIA8oYAaa	Believe me she will find out, don't be the messenger that gets shot, stay out of it.
KrYbNZi8aa	Lmao    laugh about it  haha I've had worse  today i was laughing when my boyfriend was tyirng to kiss me  and i spit in his mouth  lol|`|MFg8oUqqaa	he probably  knows it's  your lipgloss. I usually  just wear chapstick when i'm going to kiss someone so that my lips are soft but not sticky becayse some guys don't like the sticky feel...(my ex bf used to like wipe his lips off cause i would get lipgloss on them) lol|`|ubk21UBvaa	just laugh about it.   bring it up as a joke or something.    but thats kinda wierd, haha|`|tjGFRs1Kaa	Uh, I guess just don't wear that lip gloss anymore when you're kissing him.|`|aRDXTWIDaa	Um don't wear lip gloss. it's cute but not very functional and will get you into sticky situations.  or just wipe it off pre kiss.|`|KDCXd3B0aa	you should have brought it up and laughed about it at the time.. just forget it now who cares, he wont think much of it. Just don't repeat.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	I'm sure it didn't matter to him as long as it was your lips stuck to his.  I know I've gotten stuck to my wife's lips (both sets) on several occasions and I didn't mind.  I'm not trying to be crude or anything, just telling the truth.  Tell him it was the lip gloss and he'll probably get a good laugh out of it.    Hope this helps.|`|Ju17SFm3aa	LO JUST TELL HIM IT WAS LIP GLOSS    Answer Mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

MMiG2bzeaa	You know Josline i hav those same complaints as well as many more. My hubby and i fight all the time about religion and family values. But compromise and counselings may help if thats all u are complaining about. You can pick a church priest for counselings which it will not cost anything. Or you know guys just need time to grow up and get serious. With my hubby i hav to speak to him like hes 4,alone when the tv is not on for him to listen. I also been married for 8yrs and girl i believe i hav had it. But my kids keep me intact with the relationship.<br>  If you want to chat more about our marriage up and downs you can find me on facebook under shazybilaly@rocketmail.com or under Shazia Rashid<br>  good luck bye|`|ZQE61wUZaa	Should have considered marrying a man with spoiled children and my husband got boring on me and I'm a very active person.  We are working on that.  Only married for 8 yrs together for 10 same as you.|`|AP2e90cCaa	Don't let go of anything and you won't regret anything.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean that you cause arguments over everything - it means that you work with your husband to strike a balance. You wouldn't have married him if he were exactly like you! Give him the right to be his own person with his own beliefs and, more importantly, give Yourself the right to be your own person with your own beliefs! Don't sacrifice so much to be pleasing. Your husband will respect you when you start respecting yourself.<br>  <br>  Start doing what You want. Don't ask - just do it. If a problem arises your husband will let you know and you can work it out to fit both of you. In the meantime, he might appreciate your endeavours and your 'take charge' attitude :)<br>  <br>  As for your family being upset with your having eloped - throw a party to celebrate your marriage!! If it's been a while then wait for an anniversary and throw a 'reception' type party where your family will feel included in your marriage. That's all they want.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I don't regret anything in my current marriage.<br>  <br>  If it's going to cause you regret, don't make the decision in the first place.  Your partners lack of belief in God has no bearing on whether or not you instill your values in your children.  His hatred for his family is HIS, not yours, so teach your children that family is family and you only get one...<br>  <br>  IT's one thing to let go of stuff you aren't attached to, for the sake of a happy relationship, but letting go of your most fundamental beliefs is not what marriage is all about.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	How long you have been married?
9NCSYFXTaa	LMAO this is a weird question.  and i guess that makes me weird for answering but oh well.    Ummm ive only ever had one guy try to put his hand a little down the back of the pants.  Mostly i get the guys that are all about the sides of the legs or the chest or even the hip bone.    ahah sorry but i think you are just getting those guys....or maybe you just have a really nice a*s and they just wanna touch lol.|`|eFDw4k9naa	yeah, my boyfriend does that all the time..lol..men.|`|nONgMUBOaa	Well he obviously really likes your butt (:    xoxoxo|`|I0NcxTUGaa	yes my guy does it and the second time he fingered me. they cant help there hormones.dont worry it happens to 79% of girls in the world.|`|2VRxUdWkaa	Probably often, I don't do that, but of course, as a male teenager, I'd like to haha, but I have some morals... And many other men do too.|`|1ZwI8ePdaa	ha i do that :p|`|3LIW9PhNaa	I say the same thing as Jasmine D exactly|`|vCTMZKrgaa	Yeah...guys aren't really that creative...or orginal...|`|3jWaexYOaa	umm.. no ...not into mi pants or anything they normally stop at my waste|`|aXljp31xaa	lol i have that happen to me everytime. its normal. so its all good. they oviously really like you or they just wanna get in your pants. so just watch out. if you feel unconfy then tell him. stick up for yaself. and if you like it then.....go all out for it!!!!|`|y3xu4wxUaa	YEAH! like every time, sometimes it is annoying but sometimes it is nice feeling|`|AOgqRoJBaa	hes just trying to get in your pants|`|QLp5ZBnUaa	well im a guy so that just means that he likes the moment of it i always do that when im kissing the girl a like|`|5R0fSY6haa	haha "boys aren't creative or original"  lol    Yeah they are just trying to get an extra feel

My friend would lie about everything and everybody knew she was lying. One day I got really sick of it, and I just told her nobody believed her... and went through every single lie she told us. She explained everything and thanked me for telling her, she's trying to get better. Point is, call her out on it and explain to her that nobody can trust her anymore or takes her seriously. It worked for me. I hope it works for you.|`|uo4Or00qaa	get a group of friends.  catch her in a lie   EX: regarding a movie, an old lie, etc etc.  A good trick is bringing up something that never was, seeing if she pretends to know, then telling her it never existed.  Unless, you mean, she lies about ppl. Then you should just gang up on her.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	If she is a compulsive liar she has a psychological problem. My advise is to be the bigger person, and not torment her. Just forget about her and move on.|`|XTFlTKnJaa	hahahah   video, or something like that   have u ever read shreaderman!!!!!!  it will help u|`|tN6JA7IQaa	Liars usually blink a lot, stutter, pause often, or avoid your eyes. Sometimes if you look close you might even see their pupils twitch a little to the side. They can also fiddle with their hair or fingers or clothes, and shift on their feet. Some people blush and some people become paler. But if they're used to lying it might be kind of hard to tell.    Hope that helps!|`|SqCgWGCqaa	Look her HARD in the eye and keep a straight face, if she laughs or anything or or doesn't look you in the eye, she is lying. Also, if she is sweating. If you look hard in her eyes you can, well It just might be my but sometimes their eyes look really shallow. You know what I'm saying?  Good luck, and karma will come around.|`|rkLSJ8SRaa	Does she make direct eye contact?|`|HzCBOwlyaa	here are the secrets of lying  ~ when people lie they tend to look towards the upper right side because they are trying to think of the next thing too say , another way to catch a liar if they cant keep eye contact while telling the lie.look for body language i notice whenever a person is lying to me their nose may twitch alittle or they may slump , have a i dont care adittude , also here is a simple thing get them to repeat the lie.....like if they are telling you a story see if the story is the same or gets mixed up if it gets mixed up they are lying to of course...it sorta snow balls , and the last thing i have to say about catching a liar is when they bring other people into it , like " you can ask so and so "  or a random person you know that you dont see enough or talk too.|`|KDNrbnZVaa	Forget about it! Move on to better people.
FUQ0sJNaaa	why would she date someone 50 years old - itll never work out - hes too old for her|`|SJbktLITaa	Anything is possible|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Sounds like she just needs to teach him to kiss better.|`|37PpYx8oaa	All men are different.  I dated a man who was 39 and loved using his tongue.  I also dated a man who was 25 and never used his tongue during kissing.  Chances are, if he doesn't do it now, he won't ever do it.|`|aRDXTWIDaa	No i don't think so. I'm sure he's attracted to her especially if he's good to look at.  Men sometimes tongue kiss at 49 but it's really creepy... he probably isn't very confident with kissing.|`|GcCdTgrxaa	Smiles, she needs to teach him the art of kissing 'cos he is missing out on a lot. Sensual kissing is such a turn on and prelude to everything else :)|`|QgYU4Iz5aa	maybe he just sucks at kissing. And yes, I sure other 49 year old guys still slip their wives/gf the tongue.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Maybe he is getting to a point where he isn't so sexually motivated.    But if she loves him and he is in love with her, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why it cannot work out. Of course, some sexual contact is important, but it isn't a necessity for a relationship to function. (Unless of course you're a nympho 17 year old prostitute, which, from your description, I gather your friend is not).    Ensure your friend realises that if she loves him, and he loves her, then everything they need is right there. They can work on the passion if they're together and talk about it, if that is what she so wishes.|`|fTdR0NEcaa	He must be attracted to her if they have great sex and oral sex.  It may be that he finds tongue kissing juvenile. Maybe he's afraid of a certain level of intimacy, because a kiss can be much more intimate than sex,  At any rate, if this is a problem for her, she and her boyfriend should discuss it like mature adults|`|kt774vEraa	I guess she simply hasn't tried French kissing him.|`|xeeQ9QkLaa	men who don't fully kiss have intimacy issues. it has nothing to do with age.|`|AA10709259	Well, my husband and I are older than your friend and her boyfriend and we kiss passionately all the time, so it's not a matter of age. Neither is it a matter of having been together too long because we have been married for almost 11 years. Maybe this guy just hasn't learned any other kissing techniques, and if she isn't doing something to show him a new way to kiss, they'll probably keep things just as they are now. Then maybe he's just feeling comfortable enough and doesn't want to go out and start dating all over again. These things are very personal, and it's hard to know from the outside.

You need help, seriously. Talk to a teacher or somebody in school and explain that your brother is terrorizing you but your parents do nothing.  Teachers are bound by law to report these kind of things. Social Services may get involved and they can help your family.    Dont try to "mentally scar" your brother, because he'll just get even more p*ssed and he'll do something even worse.|`|9llaOlAvaa	Wow your pretty articulate for being 12 years old.

5BbxO5U9aa	switch every now and then bring some friends to hang out with the other person so they dont feel left out and don't spend too much time with on friend|`|2Cvdu454aa	honestly you shouldn't listen to this erm 'lassie's' mum, because honestly, your friends are the family you choose for yourself  being with your friends is the most important thing there is in life. hang out with both of them and explain to 'lassie' that it just isnt fair making you choose and that if she wants to go rollerskating she should, but 'benji' will be there and its up to her to choose  it shouldnt be left to the third party (you) to pick up the pieces and sort things out|`|uY0y2alSaa	the mom should stop being a meanie|`|IPDAG6vyaa	the worst thing to do is choose between friends. now if you want both your friends to go rollerskating, then invite both. as for lassie's mom's oppion, she just has to deal with that herself. let lassie know that benji is coming and vice versa. its up to lassie to decide if she wants to agree and follow her mom. lassie's mom isnt god. you dont have to do what she says.

If you live in a state that has milder winters....then go right ahead.    Another thought:  People might be pooped out from partying on New Year's Eve AND places (venues) may be more expensive given that New Year's Day is a holiday.  I would think about that also.    My choice would be the fall.  I was married in the fall and so was my daughter.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	In your circumstance, definitely fall.

IPS3hWweaa	About $5000.    Maybe less if you already have a place that you are moving into, if not, you'll need money for rent and deposit plus money for food during the time that you are moving in. A moving truck can be pretty expensive, plus fuel to get there.

ktDZjbH7aa	HI CHAR,,,HONEY,,BRAG ON WHAT THERE WEARING,,ASK THEM WERE THEY BOUGHT IT,,,ASK THEM I F THEY HAVE PETS,,,AND JUST REMEMBER,,,THERE THINKING THE SAME AS YOU,,,,JUST TALK ABOUT ANYTHING,,,PEACE|`|NqbBjS0raa	Boring is not the issue. Knowing how to chat, talk with other people in a peer group or among others seems to need some confidence building. I will focus on that, and other ideas might spring forth into your young head. <br>  1. knowing their interests and being in tune with your friends. <br>  2. conversations work best if you care about them first then yourself.<br>  3. keep up with topics of interest, and try to be knowledgeable on tthem.<br>  4. Take a couple of deep breaths until you feel comfortable speaking.<br>  5. Being boring is your perception and not theirs so be prepared before speaking.<br>  Good luck and go for it.....|`|BL4PEjAWaa	boring people often talk to much.  Listen to what they talk about and if you have an opinion state it.  Do not spread gossip just to have something to say.  Do not make up stories and never lie.  when you speak have something to say.  If you are not sure what you're saying is correct state that fact.<br>                                                 hope I helped
uBssj3Znaa	nope ... you just have to ask.|`|t0uIgY08aa	just ask if she is seeing anyone. its not that hard.|`|WJ1agL9Eaa	look at fingers see if there a boyfriend around and me i do not care i go in for the catch do not be shy ;)|`|ubk21UBvaa	well if you see her out somewhere, or she says shes gonna go somewhere(out to coffee or w/e) just casually say, "with who, your boyfriend?"    and then she'll either say yes or no. haha, but be really casual about it|`|YN1lQLZWaa	Just ask her if she is seeing anyone  or tell your friend to do it for you.|`|KmaXKjuHaa	Yep ask her friend its a safe way if your shy. THEN, she will tell her friend that you asked about her and then SHE will know that you inquired about her. SHE will be flattered! When you see her again be nice and say hello and chat if you wish. BE nice, she may come around in the future. Use this time to chat so she can get to know you as a person, if she has a man, she may find you more appealing!     Also, dress sharp and be a gentleman!|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Darth Brady would always ask. Don't need some idiot running up on me.|`|R2BBjtaraa	are you taken?  do you have a man-friend?  marry me.      lol  just try to flirt with her a little type thing or casually be like "i wish i had a girlfriend like you" or something so she will reveal whether or not she has a boyfriend or like "your boyfriend must be lucky" lol|`|vTvsgVJiaa	So do you have any plans for Valentine's day?    Or if you want to be more bold... are you and your boyfriend doing anything for valentine's day?    Or you could just say "a girl as sweet as you must have been snatched up a long time ago, so I probably don't have a chance... or do i?"|`|ClBkTdOEaa	as a girl it would be awkward to be asked. Ask her friends and they'll tell her and if she likes you she'll smile when she sees you or go out of her way to walk by you. But ask around don't go up to her. Unless you really wanna be a man and have the possibility of being rejected in person.|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	You say ...how was dinner and then she says fine very...simple...if there is no ring then she IS single.|`|MK1z64Kraa	you could ask if she likes anyone|`|otnJOmwSaa	Ask her what her boyfriends name is..... or ask her how long has she been in a relationship... and if she asks why just say you just are assuming that she was in a relationship because she was pretty.... hot etc...|`|AA12071655	After chatting her up a bit I ask "would your boyfriend be jealous if I asked you to lunch?"    That's here chance to tell you if there is a boyfriend without you asking directly.|`|9PbyjAEXaa	get a friend 2 ask|`|xbMLtXOuaa	ask her how her boyfriend is doing, she will either say she doesnt have one or good, then youll know|`|bM4zYt44aa	Well you get real close and you sniff her, see if she smells like a guy or smells like she just got done humping....No, you can't tell without asking you moron!|`|tHjrE2dVaa	I dont know your relationship with the girl but get to know her. An instead of "are you single" ask like "are you intrested in anybody at this time" its a lot more comfortable and smooth. work that question into her you dont wanna waste your time i understand but you dont want to let it go|`|KDCXd3B0aa	ASK HER FRIEND.|`|RgbARcJTaa	try to talk to her about her boyfriend   if shes single she'll say  i dont have a boy friend  YOu: blah blah blah ....... so you live with your boyfriend?  her : oh no im single ect  random question but you gte the point right|`|3frIC80naa	in conversation just say "what does your bf think about that" or "does ur bf get jealous when u talk to other guys" assuming she would answer "What boyfriend?" or "Who told you i have a boyfriend". then you'd say "well a pretty girl like yourself i'd think would be taken." .... something like that. good luck.|`|aRDXTWIDaa	get her cell phone. the backround or banner might give you a hint. i know it's an invasion of privacy but sometimes what they don't know won't hurt them.|`|3H9k7tN5aa	Just ask a question that will give you the answer without making it odd. Like "Did you go with your bf to prom? My gf broke up with me like a month before it!" just stupid sht. Just use your head. I can really give you a good question since i don't know how old you are, or know the girl. But just stupid stuff. Every hint counts.|`|abF3qO3aaa	You can slyly hint at it. Like say something like "your boyfriend is one lucky guy". That way it gives both of you an easy way out. If it turns out she does have a boyfriend, you don't end up looking like a douche. If she doesn't have a bf then you just gave her a compliment and let her know you're interested.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	say casually "so.. what are you and your boyfriend doing on valentine's day?"|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	you cant unless u r a mind reader|`|BF8GlwyDaa	keep a close eye on her without you noticing.... ask around if she has any friends.... ask your friends or her friends if they know|`|hfG5Ag7jaa	make something up. if you say something like i think your boyfriend is looking for you then she can either answer okay thanks and go look for him, or she will say oh i dont have a boyfriend.|`|9en6c7cRaa	If you're complimenting her or something, then there's a very easy method. You compliment her like saying something like, "you're so nice (or beautiful, whatever suits you.)." and then follow it up with, "Your boyfriend must be really happy."|`|1nMYqT1qaa	Honestly, you need to just come out and ask her.  There are "better" ways of phrasing it, like "Before I start flirting with you, or asking you out on a date I wanted to ask you if you're already seeing someone.  It wouldn't be fair of me to try to steal you away from your boyfriend..if you have one."  Something to that affect.  If nothing else, you'll come across as a gentleman and if she *is* seeing someone..she may just keep you in mind for another time, if and when she is single again.  "Brownie Points" are good in the dating world.|`|GS4a3Vwdaa	It's never a waste of time!Instead of trying to figure out right away, just get to know her.If she isn't single, you can still talk to her, and who knows, maybe she and her boyfriend will break up--she'll be coming to you for support.If you were to find out she isn't single right this second, would you then stop talking to her? Exactly my point! If you don't try to get to know her, you'll never have a chance.|`|zfvsSjYbaa	There isn't another way except to ask a friend to ask for you or say something like i think blank and blank like eachother do you like anyone? or you could say im bored random question: do u have a boyfriend
fzIeGPZYaa	thats really mean; its not right to EVER put down your partner. you should try to get him to go to counseling with you|`|k73IxCHaaa	Ok, I been married just a little longer than you and I can tell you, early in our marriage my wife use to do the same thing to me. She would always doing it in the presence of her immediate family so I blew it off as her insecurity and getting there attention. Until one day she crossed the line.    Her cousin was visiting whom I 've never met. She brought along her two children and her husband who all stayed with us. We then invited her 5 sisters over in addition to their husbands and kids. Her mother was also there. Well as usual she started with her put downs and snide comments, I was furious but didn't let her know that it bothered me in front of her family.    After everyone left I calmly told her that if she was to ever to do that again, we were through, and I met it, and she knew it. I have never disrespected her in public or private and I'm not going to let her do it to me. I only have one rule of marriage "if I don't do it to you, you don't do it to me".    I don't mean to sound harsh, but is my self-respect and dignity more important then this marriage, the answer is a resounding "yes'. So to answer your question he is being disrespectful.|`|96HWpdkFaa	You need to talk to him and tell him how your feeling..I'm not having this issue..but I am having an issue with my husband and talking calm and letting him know how I hurt when he does certain things helps some...I listen to what he has to say and he listens to me.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You get sad? I would HUMILIATE him every time. OK, I acknowledge that this might not be the healthiest way to deal with this, but I assume you've already told him how it made you feel. Did that change anything? You could, alternatively, try embarrassing him.  Whatever he says to you, respond with something worse.    Though I have to say, making fun of your shirt isn't that bad. The weight, absolutely unacceptable. So what are his weak points? Bald, gassy, bad teeth, lazy? Tell him, right in front of others.|`|74aZAQmMaa	Serious answer...You are being self contious. What if he makes fun of your shirt or your weight?! so what, it doesnt mean that he stopped loving you.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Just because he has been doing this for 24 years doesn't mean you are stuck with it. You need to tell him in no uncertain terms that what he is doing is upsetting to you and you don't think it is the least bit funny when he demeans you in public, and you want it to stop at once. I would never apologize to him again for getting upset about it, and make sure that he knows why. You might remind him that we all change as we age, and he is not exactly Peter Pan, either.    There is nothing manly about demeaning ones wife, although many men talk about "the old ball and chain", and "the old lady", just to sound macho. That he does it around other people in general is even worse. Good luck.|`|4NLNtQnsaa	sounds like he's passive aggressive or he dosent like something about himself|`|4PQOiSfZaa	It could mean that your husband is embarrassed to be with you for whatever reason or your husband is hiding his feelings and is afraid of acting like a gentleman and be accused of being a doormat.|`|dVlLahozaa	he sounds like an idiot you realize that is psychological abuse and you need to exit that relationship.|`|ohpedSQUaa	Tell him exactly how it makes you feel when he does that and if he still continues doing it, do it to him and let him see how it feels.  It happened to me too, it was just a way for him to control me.  If I was too happy he would say something that would upset me so I could be as miserable as he was.  I said goodbye to him and found out exactly how much he controled me.  No friends, my family wouldn't come and visit me because they hated the way he treated me.|`|5SR5Hyfeaa	You need to have a good chat with him. Help him understand his words hurt. And find a way to help him understand when he is doing it.  It sounds like he is ashamed of him self, and when in public he cuts you down , so he will look better. It may be even subconscious.  jp|`|wmOgseCgaa	He needs to know that what he is saying is hurting you. If you have been married for 25 yrs then you know that men are not the brightest. They have to be told what they said or did that upset you. Some just have a dog's mind, they forget what they have said or done after about 5 mins.  If my hubby were to say something like that to me I would say F*** You and walk away. Then he knows what he said made me angry. But if you get sad and don't express your feelings then he won't have any idea what he said or did that upset you.|`|FvVqFFrNaa	you sound like my mom, and your hubby sounds like my dad. my dad always teases my mom and i know it offends her. he calls her names like "bubba big butt" and has since i can remember. it used to not bother her but she gained wieght after a car accident and now it hits home. i would just tell him it bothers you. my mom laughed it off and no one knew it was getting to her. my dad isnt very good with emotional stuff, so i think it was his weird way of bonding with my sis and i by picking on her. wierd but true. just be direct...maybe he has no idea its hurting you|`|iD4ejChZaa	i believe there are other issues he is not happy with you about and takes it out on you this way, like being around people gives him false confidence, well thats one theory.      either come up with snide remarks or learn to ignore it,  God says do not repay evil with evil. if my husband din't like my shirt i couldn't care less,|`|8G7Yx9MRaa	This is exactly my situation, except he only does it when we're alone. When we're in front of people, it's not as often. Then I get upset and he can't figure out why... then I get pissed off, then I do something to piss him off and before you know it, we're fighting.    I don't know what to say except to let some things roll of your shoulders. I've started just laughing the stuff off or when he says a comment about me, in my head I think of an insult that I wish I could tell him. It makes me feel better inside. But his problem is that he'll say a mean comment, then go "JUST KIDDING!!!" But I also have started saying little cutsie insults back like "you're a butt face" (instead of "you a*s hole!!) in a cute little way so that he'll joke cutsie back and for the most part it works. Plus makes me feel better! lol    men... we can't live with them, but can't live without them :) Good luck honey

yGwda7wPaa	The way to get them to see you are responsible is to be responsible.  Do you ever babysit?  Get some jobs babysitting, and earn some extra money.  Help out more around the house.  Then, perhaps they will see you are no longer a kid.  Also, when you are old enough to get a driver's license, this will help a lot.  Also, how are your grades?  Are you involved in anything at school?  If you are responsible at school, and are managing that well, that should help too.|`|nrZE85MJaa	leave them alone
xc8bnpCvaa	I think you should go to your boss and explain the situation. Just as you have here. <br>  He will naturally make his own decision, which will be NOT to hire her. <br>  <br>  Then when your aunt asks if you talked to him, you can honestly say yes. and that there are no positions available (if there were positions advertised you can say he has already chosen candidates for those positions)|`|BJugETlOaa	Tell your boss about the problem, tell him that you have an aunt that keep badgering her to get a job there but she is not a good worker. He could interveiw her and then not hire her and you would  be off the hook. You put in your word for her and he isn't hireing anyone at the moment.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	I think you should tell your boss not to hire her and make sure he keeps it to himself what you have told him.|`|WvevK4n0aa	tell your aunt that you talked to your boss and they don't need more employees right now,but maybe in a future...<br>  try to find another job for your aunt which has nothing to do with yours<br>  but never tell your boss that she's an incompetent person lol|`|gKNRJbVYaa	It's simple. Just tell your aunt you talked to your boss and right now they are not hiring because of the economy|`|sDfBDXpXaa	I'd tell her that your place of business is not currently hiring. <br>  You don't want to mess up a good thing.|`|eda1e3044f3b72caa810590b84628887aa	throw her under the bus|`|SNslrDPNaa	Tell your aunt that if she wants a job that she needs to talk to the boss herself. If the boss says she used you as a reference and what is your opinion, give it to him honestly. She established the horrible work history and it is not fair for her to ask you to go to such length for her. She needs to re-establish herself without your help.|`|dK2Zv21Daa	Hiring her is not  your problem. If she needs a job and you can help  then do so. But also  let it be known that her reputation won't be allowed to  impact on  your goodwill.  <br>    Tell Your boss the truth about  her and how you feel, make him aware of some of her known traits, but  you still have a moral  urge to help or at least try to help.    Love your story, hope I answered you well
9GXSpe3aaa	I say , qive him the three months . If he's true , and you believe him & trust him , why screw it up ? And besides , Its only a few months wasted if he screws you over . I know you must be crushed about it , and i surely would be too . But maybe he really did have your best interest in mind . If he's true then it will be okay .|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	well, love is about trust. so if you truely love this person i would think you would trust that hes telling the truth. if he doesnt come back in 3months like he says he going to, dumb his behind.|`|NAwWqDMAaa	what i think is ... hes lying to you .<br>  its so cheesey what he said to you about "im leaving you my heart" any guy could say that,they say it cos they no the girls will believe it . think about it though .. if he wont leave you anything that he can come back for then you know he isnt coming back at all . there must be a reason why he is lying to you. if you have tried talking to him about it already then there isnt much point in trying no longer . maybe hes fallen out of love with you and just wants out . sorry x xx|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Wow was that cold. Do you really want to be with someone who would lie and deceive you like this? Think about it.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Forget this guy honey. I doubt very seriously if he intends on coming and I think he is just stringing you along. Besides, he lied to you and broke your heart, why would you want to risk that again?
jp9OzuXoaa	Family:  -blood-related  -do not have the option to "leave you"-- you're family/stuck with them no matter what    Friends:  -are most likely more fun to be around  -do not live with you  -are usually around for a short period of time. Lifelong friends are rare.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I agreed with the first answer  Family  -relatives/parents who support you and your decisions  -you can share feelings and experiences with anyone at home  -only disadvantage that they may invade your privacy    Friends  -friends come and go but enemies accumulate  -spends you with most of the time for activities  -brings out the best joys out of your life  -only disadvantage is that friends can betray your trust easily    I would choose family over friends.
ktDZjbH7aa	HI EMILY,,,I THINK EVEN I F IT MEANS LOOSING HER FRIENDSHIP,,U NEED TO TELL HER MOM OR DAD,,OR SOMEONE U NO WHO WILL TRY TO HELP HER,,,AND ALSO TELL HER U CANT HANDEL BEING HER FRIEND IF SHE KEEPS HURTING HERSELF,,,AND JUST WALK AWAY,,SOMETIMES ITS THE BEST THING TO DO,,,THEN JUST MAYBE SHE WILL STOP,,,,PEACE|`|VCX7S3d6aa	When she's ready she'll see some one but until then she has to go this alone. All you can do is make sure shes oright, support her BUT ONLY WHEN SHE WANTS TO TALK ! if u push her to start telling you things she'll just break down ! until the time shes ready to talk reasure her that no matter what you'll be there.|`|6A954Ptdaa	I am sorry to hear about your friend.<br>  If she refuses to do anything about it there is little you can do, if i were in the same position I would tell them I am there for them any time they need and give there space i sure they will come round :)|`|OYGGdSLcaa	Ask her for her reason why she's hurting herself, if you can understand her maybe you can help her. E-mail me if you need more advice.|`|KlSjISoQaa	If someone doesn't want to help themselves it's unlikely you can help.<br>  <br>  You can encourage her to built her confidence and be in a social environment as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Do things that give her a buzz sky diving or if you want to keep it normal sports, swimming. Working out is good for the body and mind. her pain will settle just slightly and with her doing things that show she is a good person is a step forward to a better life for her. It will make her see she is a nice person. <br>  <br>  Gradually try and get her to seek help. Angelina Jo Lee went through self-harming process, your friend may want to see clips of her talking about it to recognized what and why she is doing this and realize it's a mistake. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  all the best with it.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	then you should tell someone professional. if you cant convince her to do it that is.<br>  and at first she might be mad, but will thank you so much when she gets better, seriously.x
I2NnRUK0aa	Hi.....I am also going through same situation. I think you should give her some time to let her understand what is going on? it looks like she  made up her mind for this moment( that is not to talk to you). There is no point in persuading and making her talk. If she really likes you or treats you as a friend ...she will talk to you. Just remember Friendship is a two way street ....and I can say you did your best and forget the rest.
0b2WSgpfaa	Sometimes I throw fits! It doesn't mean I'm immature (or does it???). I think he's wrong. Also, being immature can sometimes even be fun!|`|CWY0szzoaa	when you type in all caps  you are immature|`|JLZqFRf3aa	It's all just immaturity until someone loses their hearing.|`|YfTMBFIIaa	throwing a fit is a single, immature event.  It makes you sound like you are four.  You will cry and whine and scream because you don't get what you want.    immaturity is when someone consistently does not prioritze efficently and correctly, has little concern for others/assumes that they are always right, deny their responsibilities, whine, and (this one is the one I experience the most) make fun of/demean others/rude (you know that people are human and they have feelings just like you and you need to respect that)|`|AA11307859	Throwing a fit...acting like a baby and crying when you don't get what you want.  Immature...you act like a kid even when your'e not angry.|`|y4VWVD94aa	well by the way you typed up your question, it makes you seem immature.  throwing a fit = getting angry over the little-list stuff.  immature = you don't act your age because you act much much younger. and people can never take you seriously.|`|AA11570236	I can't make an assessment but he should try to help you.Try talikng about it .

You say your friends do not have the same problem, I bet you they do only they aren't telling you.

EYPY87woaa	My boyfriend and I get into stupid little fights about umm....two or three times a week now.  We have been together over 2 years.  We love each other, but when you spend all of your time together you get a little irritated with one another.  Just spend a little less time together, and try new things together.  For example, my boyfriend and I tried sushi together for the first time.|`|lWd6fkgFaa	if your boyfriend isn't trying to work things out then its time to dump him. find someone who is|`|7ouqu8f4aa	If you think you guys are getting bored, don't spend every waking second with each other.

I have had a problem really similar, only you two have been together longer than us... Well, what I would do is I would ask him if he realizes that you two are getting into big fights and that you are worried by it.

Then, when he answers yes, say I LOVE YOU TOO! and then hug him and ask him if you can stop fighting. Now if he says no, breakup w/him...  And now that I helped you, can you help me?

ASAP|`|r64eBg1haa	well its sounds like yu and your bf have been together for too long and that may mean that its time to move on|`|pfm0wcEIaa	The best way is just to talk to him and ask him what is going on.

You need to have a sit down and find out how serious he is about your relationship. A lot of guys just start acting like jerks or not putting any effort into the relationship in hopes they won't have to break up. They prefer to let the girl do the dirty work. A relationship is doomed if only one person works at it.|`|0b2WSgpfaa	Is he REALLY worth all the fighting you are putting yourself through? Maybe this is a sign he just getting bored of you!

If things are already falling apart to the friendship only level, what makes you think it will turn itself around, hell marriages end for less than that, I dont know what you expect out of a relationship, but living with someone that is like your sister to you, well I think you can figure the rest out ! Or maybe you should be like allot of others out there, and pop out a kiddling they always think it will make it better. I have been there done that, and you are going to end up living with a sexual anti Christ for a girlfriend or spouse.|`|dVlLahozaa	doggy style sex|`|cjYqQ4Ntaa	You never loose it ! dreams ....you will see............|`|bmoCpcdraa	maybe you both need a hot bath to relax and a man to spice it up|`|mR8Sdijvaa	My opinion is that you could really take two options:     option one would be if you two are always together 24/7 type couple then you both should spend time apart for awhile. see how much you miss each other and then at the end of you time apart you should go for a dinner or have a movie type thing. it will make you both reflect on your thoughts of each other and refresh in each others mind how much love there is.    option two would be to skip being apart and go on a type of vacation or trip where it is just you both and see where that gets you.    just my opinions and good luck to you both.
c7oUczEtaa	i dunno, he seems like kind of a jerk. if he acts nervous around you or you catch him looking at you constantly than he definitley has a thing for you.|`|CYLGIL7vaa	ok he is either being totally annoying to get your attention for no purpose at all (my guyfriend does this to me like all the time) or ddddddduuuuuuuhhhhhhh he likes you!!!!! of couse i mean come on, boys do that when they like u or else he wouldnt be giving u the time of day!!!!!!!|`|0JgenGPtaa	i think he may like you.  a guy has weird ways for telling a girl that he likes her. hmm you won't know unless you ask him, it's kinda hard to tell.     he may be afraid of asking you out upfront, guys are scare of rejection, too.    have a chat with him alone. ask him does he has a girl that he like:)|`|VCRP9efqaa	yeah,  he likes u.  but  i think the real question is...  do u like him?  lol|`|LFVeODxIaa	i have a guy friend who does that all the time and so i think he is either being really annoying cuz he feels like it or he likes you. lol personaly i think he is annoying you to get your attention.    see my bff is Enjuli so we will have the same answer.|`|mS1fej9Jaa	Aww..high school crushes are so cute =)    and yes..I think he likes you..likes you.|`|V2IGDBHIaa	He probably wants your attention and might like you and just don't know how to express it. Could be just he fears rejection and hasn't found the courage to tell you yet. If you like him then you could always give hints or just tell him.|`|d0fc65f726f4bd56a6ce4f789ee11991aa	Um he sounds like one of those dumb(i don't mean dumb as in not smart I mean randomly stupid..haha if that makes sense.), but usually hot guys.

Wow. That is crazy. I would straight call her out. Face to face.     I take that back, if it were me, I'd invite her over and have it up on my computer. Then see what she has to say. I don't know if that's good advice though as I tend to be a bit immature in certain situations.    Nevermind, I read that wrong...I thought you said it was a girl you were dating.     If it's just a girl you know...don't do anything. It's not your business, you know?|`|NPAQxqgNaa	I think I need to see the link to truly give you good advice.

As long as the two of you have a connection, and are happy, who cares what anyone else thinks.  Just realize that if it is to be a long-term relationship, there are some difficulties.  People tend to see things differently.|`|vCTMZKrgaa	milf...|`|abF3qO3aaa	Depends on the age difference|`|S852p6SXaa	i dont care..well i mean like if shes really old and i mean really old, then its kind of disturbing cause she could pass for his (grand) mother.
7KhIn4HJaa	I don't think so.Actually I think at this young age guys/girls doesn't know what's love.It's mostly like a crush nothing else.One of my cousin is in 5th grade lol and yea she always tells me I am in love and I always make fun of her lol don't mind but it's true because 5th graders are really young to be in real love.|`|AA11185479	Yes and no.  He is experiencing the most love he is capable of at that age; but as you grow older, you are capable of much greater love, and it grows exponentially every year.  So the "puppy love" he feels at age 11 can't compare the sort of love he will feel at age 14; which in turn can't compare to the sort of love he will feel at age 18; which in turn can't compare to 25, 33, 40, etc.|`|xXWSpw5Saa	yes..... my cousin from Arkansas got married (shes 11) last year cuz she fell in love in the 5th grad|`|JERUmEFzaa	Yah. Your heart makes the choices....|`|FU5z9yWuaa	i dnt think it will be called love its probably just a crush this boy can' t love u coz personally i think thats a word u would say to some one who u want to get serious with or have a possiblity of marriage or long term relationship with...and ur too young focus on having FUUNN thats what i did at 11|`|cmi9lKuAaa	Yes you can fall in love but which 11-year-old really knows what true love is?    I'm 12 and I believe kids my age these days get paranoid.    They think they're in love and want to get married, make love to each other, etc.    It's totally stupid..    You can fall in love in any age but it's really hard to determine whether it's real or not.|`|KTCipJUcaa	no.|`|B4vaMi6Naa	I did. Im in 6th grade and I LOVED this guy!But he dumped me a couple months ago! in like, uh November I think anyways i still cry myself to sleep. Let me tell you this, don't get too into him because he'll dump you once you you start to like him the most :(
aYZ5Gm03aa	You will probably have to file jointly for 2007, but separate for 2008.. i would think it would be based on your marriage status. if you have children, you need to have been specific on who can claim the child on their taxes. if you have more than one child it would be in your best interest to try and be able to claim one..|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Married, but filing separately.|`|8tJPK69iaa	I'd file separate. My ex tried to get me to pay all the taxes when we filed together after we separated. Stupid me.|`|yy45iAbtaa	separate.|`|hzFf2SLAaa	As always, contact your tax advisor, but from what I know you can file either single or married, but filing separately.|`|AA11603829	Since the seperation was back in 2007 you can file seperate returns. I would put myself down as head of household in this situation. You spose should do the same|`|yGwda7wPaa	If you are divorced, you have to file separate.  The IRS only cares about if you were married on December 31st.  I was divorced on December 18, and I still have to file separate.  Good luck.
AA10065812	What makes you think they are lying about you?  Have they told you what they are saying, or are you getting this second hand from the mother.  Let me tell about a study done at UCLA on 300 children, under the age of 10.    A medical student performed simple peripheral examinations of the children.  All of the exams were video taped, and did not involve the removal of any clothing.  There was no one else in the room, except the child and the medical student.    For eight weeks, their mothers asked them daily about what took place during the exam?  Were they uncomfortable with anything the man did.    At the end of the eight weeks, all 300 children had elaborate stories of inappropriate touching by the medical student, including taking their clothes off.    Children are very easy to manipulate.  Which can also be a problem with you trying to question them about why they lied.      Children under the age of puberty have no concept of right or wrong.  They only know action and reaction.  The act, you react.  They have no concept of lying, only that you react in a certain way when they say a certain thing you know is wrong.  Here's a good example:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ysFvUizR...    If she is manipulating them, that's Parental Alienation:  http://www.parentalalienation.org/    You need to consider a custody change, as this can accelerate rapidly to allegations of child sexual abuse.    Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.       Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	If the children's natural mother has a mental condition is she under supervision from a medical professional?  Are the children under the care of a social worker?   If not it might be time to bring one in through your family services.   Explain what is going on (or your husband should as he is the father), tell the social worker the children are lying making up stories & this could injure your career prospects as well as teaching the children bad habits.     The other option is to advise the mother in written form (get lawyer's advice), if she continues to make false accusations you will have her before a court facing slander charges.  You have to be careful when dealing with someone suffering as mental illness as they can twist things in all sorts of ways.   Can you advise your employer (I assume you work in a school or if studying advise the principal), in a confidential manner what this woman is suffering from & what she is up to (it should give you some sort of protection from her malicious lies).   Good luck & take care|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Ignore it!    Thats truly the BEST advice anyone can give you on this matter.   People who know you, know that you wouldn't talk to a child that way. And people that you work with or go to school with will also be able to look at the person this info is coming from,and then look at you and realize who's really lying.     Ignore it, and let it be. She's only doing this to get to you. Let her see that it's not getting to you and continue on with your life. Eventually she will grow tired/bored with what shes doing and she will leave you alone,|`|96HWpdkFaa	you and your husband need to sit down with the kids and ask why they tell their mother these things...tell them how much you both love them and that it hurts that they say these things. Say it calm and see what they say.|`|yGwda7wPaa	I have been in a very similar situation.  This is what I suggest.  Talk to the kids.  Sit them all down at one time, and have a family meeting.  Tell them the problem, and what you expect in the future.  The reason that they are doing this is to get attention from their mother.  She is feeding on this.  This is a problem with the children more than it is the ex.  You need to get to the bottom of why they are lying, and let them know that you are serious.|`|BzH7l27oaa	All you can do is try to prove to them through communications and actions that you are not who they paint you to be.     I would talk to them and ask why they say those things.
tjGFRs1Kaa	He may just get stressed out easily, or he may be a perfectionist. I think you should just calmly address this issue to him when he is in a good mood.|`|p0dxIZeSaa	hmmm try talking to him about it and if you get a bad reaction i think you should question the relationship as well as threaten it and tell him to talk to you when he gets his mind right|`|YzWkNRFZaa	Listen here my friend, you don't seem like the kind of girl that should be with a perfectionist. I myself am laid back, and i cant stand people that flip over the tiniest little things.|`|QPY5awssaa	some dudes just got that problem. just try to laugh when he's mad (not at him but with him) to ease the mood or sex usually calms me down|`|lczzYLmSaa	i dont think u even need for me to say this but i enjoy putting my two sense in so:........LEAVE HIM!!!! ok hes too moody and ur not enjoyin urslf so y be with him?!?! seriously u deserve a guy who u enjoy bein with and who enjoys being with u!!! so find ur mr. right and leave ur mr. moody!!!! NOW!!!! why r u still reading this? i said right now!! lol or when ever u want xD enjoy ur soon to be freedom|`|a55CPBtRaa	I don't know how long you've been with this guy, but this isn't good. My ex was the same way and come to find out it had nothing to do with me. He was insecure and had serious anger issues. Eventually he started pushing me around and I left before anything else happened. Don't make excuses for him first of all and don't feel like it's your fault. You may want to speak to someone who can give more intimate details to but outbursts are just the beginning in most cases. Be careful and good luck.|`|mHZvOhsDaa	ha, sounds like my dad, yeah my dad has always been like that, nothing i do or my family does is sufficient or acceptable. its how he is, i assume thats how your bf is.. in which case if you cant deal with it time to leave. sounds sad i know cause it is! but what makes you think its going to get better.. dont endure all of it because you only have 1 life.. not like you can say oh well its only 1 marriage.. lol u could say that with a date.. but seeing you are already DATING time to figure out what you want.    so ask yourself this    does it bug me this much? if so can i talk to him about it?    if not, im sure yo know whast you should do :/|`|9NCSYFXTaa	Wow. My mom is this exact same way.  Ummm my advise is get him some ANGER MANAGEMENT. Seriously you should NOT be freaking out if something goes wrong.  I think the things that go wrong, go wrong for a REASON!  so either that, or tell him to calm down. take a chill pill.   Or you could also sit him down and explain that you think he takes things to seriously and that it makes you feel alittle uneasy to have to watch what you say and do.|`|pn6x81NAaa	It's time to move on he will always be moody.|`|tdPxXX4Xaa	I think that if he is moody and rude to you , you guys were not meant for each other or you just need to go talk to him about it and just say,     i am sorry for doing that mistake i will try not to do that then just say but I would like you too tell me in a nice way and that you do not want him screaming at you...if you can not tell him or he does not change then he is a bad boy friend and he is obviously not your soul mate|`|1nMYqT1qaa	Honestly, your boyfriend's "reactions" to the little things that would, for the most part, not bother the average guy, would raise some serious red flags in my book.  If he freaks out like this and takes it out on you, its called emotional/verbal abuse..which, in time, could lead to physical abuse.  I know you love him and all, but you've got to ask yourself if your relationship is worth the torment.  Your man needs some counseling...at the very least.  Don't become another statistic.  You're worth more than that.|`|bM4zYt44aa	Give him head.  On a serious note, maybe he's bipolar, talk to him about it, he may also just be stressed out.  Or maybe it's things that you do a lot that has become a pet peeve to him.  Things got like that with my ex, I would get moody a lot and she talked to me about it, sometimes it was just that I was stressed about something and didn't mean to take it out on her, so I made a conscious effort to not do that, it worked well.  Other things were she would make the same mistakes all the time and it got to where it became a pet peeve because I would always try to help her out with it but after 2 years it seems pointless and I couldn't help but get livid.  I still didn't take it out on her though, I would just have to extract myself from the activity or situation for a few minutes.|`|eecd821253f92631f0c25af4818f1d14aa	Well, you should communicate on this sort of problem with him, I am sure if you guys truly love each other you are going to work out your differences. He might explain some of the things that look wrong on his side and you should do the same. If things don't work out well then there's plenty of fish out there and if you cannot handle his state of anger then you really need to find someone else.
YjUyBWPEaa	He sounds like a mess.  Honestly it does take some guys to age to get their acts together but 43!  He should be way past the screwing up stage and into the got it together stage.  The good ones sometimes are going through the mid life crisis stage at that age but he sounds like he has been doing this for a while and its not a new stage in his life.  I think he sounds like a lier and a man who cant be trusted!  I feel sorry for your sister.  Try not to keep telling her how worthless he is though cause Im sure she knows.  She probably just needs you to be a "friend" and listen.  Sooner or later she will get tired of it and kick him out if she has any self esteem.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I wouldn't put up with it I'd leave.|`|AA11603829	Maybe he is just a little bored with the current situation but loves his wife enough to not want to go out a cheat on her. So he uses the phone sex as a "safe" way of doing something different without crossing the line.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Sounds like compulsive behavior. Can she get him to see a therapist? There are also 12 step groups for sex addicts...Sex Addicts Anonymous, maybe?|`|GWRP3vLQaa	It is her problem. She will have to deal with it. Personally, it would creep me out and he would be outa there.|`|VUvfWG7Eaa	You say they have a sex life, well there is a big difference between sex and making love to the one your with, just because it is your sister don't assume that everything is up to par on her end, maybe there is a problem created in the home, the bedroom, just because people stay married and have sex together it don't mean they have a "SEX " life, unless you are standing in the room with them to see for yourself, you need to place the blame on both, affairs don't just happen for no reason, most of them are because of what there relationships are lacking at home, they may have a great partner, spouse  and friend but when it comes to a lover, they are boring, selfish, and self centered when it comes to that area.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	It boils down to what she is willing to accept.    He probably won't change and if it bothers her that much, tell him. If it persists, leave.|`|8G7Yx9MRaa	disconnect the house phone and she uses a cell phone.
5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	You take responsibility for the wrong you have done towards the person by admitting it, asking forgiveness, and having enough respect for the other person to realize that you have caused them enough pain and will now leave them alone.  Hopefully they are smart enough not to ever contact you again, and hopefully you are smart enough to check yourself and make a change for the better so that you treat people with more respect.

43D89edDaa	If my assumption is correct, your husband isn't checking in with himself emotionally. He may be making up rules in his head that no one else knows that you are breaking... he's being rude and inconsiderate because he is angry with his life at the moment. I wouldn't blame you for his anger, he married you after all... but there are alot of things guys don't pay attention to (like their own feelings) and it comes out as hurtful things said and inconsiderate and selfish mannerisms.<br>  <br>  He needs to check in personally, assess how he is feeling, and figure things out. He needs to do a lot of communicating with you and you both need to discover the problems that are attacking the marriage and take them head on.<br>  <br>  Remember that it isn't you vs. him or him vs you. It is you and him vs. the problem. Keep trying your best, and ask for his help still. Try your best not to attack him verbally because then he won't have any ground to stand on and he will most likely want to help you and feel bad for being a jerk.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I have been around several Indian husbands and they all seem to be very cold towards their wives.

ef900587f42a3006a5209f45881cb638aa	Well first of all it is not the mother's decision to keep the child away from the mother.  Hopefully he is paying support for the child.  If I were him, I would apply for joint custody and if he gets it great but if he doesn't then he has room to negiogiate for visitation.  He needs to take into consideration medical decisions, school decisions, etc for the child.  Make sure you discuss this as well within your filing papers.  Good luck

You act like I'm invisible.<br>  <br>  <br>  To make friends, you can find similar interests with other people, join something like track, or cheer leading, dance, basketball, or you can just smile and say hi to people.|`|KQqZF63oaa	I know how you feel.  The reason it's bothering you so much that you're drifting apart is because you love her and she's still your best friend.  I know you are sick of her there is a thin line between love and hate and when she says or does something stupid it bothers you right and you're annoyed?  but think about all the things she's done for you and how she's comforted and been there for you. When you think about it you can't stay mad at her.  But tell her can you please like stop for real that worked with my best friend :).  If she gives you a dirty look just be like why are you acting like this what did I do?  I think you should ask her what her problem is but best thing is to make more friends and come out of your shell you will probably make AMAZING friends!|`|xA2SRCT3aa	tell her exactly how you feel.. that youre drifting apart and shes changing and not necessarily for the best. i know its difficult..but the most important thing for you to do is overcome your shyness. It may seem impossible but all you have to do is open up to people and try creating conversations. just act like theyre your best friends that your really comfortable around. its tough but your really gunna have to try in order to have a great high school experience. if your best friend is drifting the worst thing for you to do is hold on to her (unless she fixes things) but like you said .. you dont want to be in her shadow. so define your own name. make other friends. playing sports is always a great way to make great friends
vbPOQ2KEaa	It could be as simple as that she thinks you look good as you are now, and she doesn't want you to do too much streaking and bleaching and start looking strange (to her generation). <br>  <br>  Try talking quietly with her... no wining or complaining, just face to face, calm talking.  Remind her that you're not doing anything that's really permanent like a tattoo or piercing, and that you'd really like her to be OK with it. You might even say that if she doesn't like it, you'll let it grow out.  Remind her that you're saving for the more expensive thing and ask if she might consider helping you out with the cost of the streaks.  COMPROMISE... maybe less streaks might make a difference to her, maybe less dramatic color, talk it out and see what's bothering her about it, and then work together so you can both be happy.<br>  <br>  You sound like a really great kid and I'm sure she knows it, too.|`|VsuvmGUraa	Maybe she's watching to much Maury, Oprah, Dr. Phil etc.<br>  <br>  No but really, Mom's have a hard time accepting change in their daughters.

I don't think she's intentionally being mean, she's just not wanting to spend money on something she's viewing as "frivolous".|`|uJNrsYpqaa	it may be that she doesnt wan to spend money cuz of the economy<br>  that happened to my friend and wen she asked thats wt her mom told her<br>  try asking ur mom<br>  hope i helped<br>  have a good day/night=)|`|Z41B2MwSaa	Doesn't sound like a sudden change to me.|`|42semosXaa	Your mom never wants you to get streaks, huh?<br>  What can I say...Misery Loves Company...|`|JQZzI49Paa	awwwwww!

She's probably thinking ahead.|`|JLZqFRf3aa	:( I really hate to be rude, but it's only fair, because it's your hair, not hers, and she shouldn't have to pay for it.<br>  <br>  Plus, do it's not like you'd die without them. :x|`|F9yxiQ1faa	probley because she's had someone say something about your apperance.<br>  My mom did the same thing when I was about 16 or 17.|`|gsem4EnYaa	maybe you should be saving your money for future purposes ?|`|2PfMa1XIaa	maybe she is just stressed because something happenned recently. well hope i helped. :D|`|cdSYbMzkaa	shes jealous bc your REALLYYYY HOTT|`|4IHe4rPYaa	ur mean :P|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Her point of view is she is not going to pay for anything she does not wish for you to do to begin with. Also she wants you to prioritize your spending habits. What means more to you the i-pod, presents, your hair. No one can have it all. She is teaching you that in her own way. she is not being mean. This is life when it comes to money and spending and you are now learning that.<br>  Also she may be teaching you that you need to save some money, then you could now get the i-pod and have your hair done too. In other words learn to budget. Yea i know it sucks, but that's the way it is. sorry

She's a nice girl, but she is pretty shy.<br>  I got her to crack by just always being really sweet to her, I'd compliment her, ask her about her life.<br>  Just warm up to her|`|Jph6y9viaa	just be best friens wtih his sister <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtLRNsD36aZK56weqra5FVzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304175325AADhdHQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ltrK052Yaa	Plan a spa day or a shopping day with her|`|AA10356839	Just keep talking with her over and over.|`|Me14R9gKaa	You two have a couple of the same interets... start with that. Maybe sometime ask her if she wants to go to the movies, or shopping. Shopping is always good!! <br>  <br>  Good luck though. I dated this guy for over a year and a half and it seems like his sister only hated me more with time. She was a ***** though... and your boyfriends sister sounds nice.|`|txAh5PPmaa	do your own homework, you will learn more that way instead of asking random strangers on YA! answers for help with your homework, besides, we are not getting payed to do your homework, so why should we even consider helping you when you are getting a decent education in school and in the end you end up coming to YA answer and asking people like me for help,<br>  <br>  slacker.|`|zjGAlILlaa	you are confused cuz she is not so outgoing???? i think you should just let things roll the way they are supposed to... if she wants to be cool with you then she will... i have been with my boyfriend for 14 months.... i hate his brother and i realized that it doesnt matter whether i like him or not.. you are in a relationship with your boyfriend... not his sister. just touch ground with her.. you dont have to be best friends|`|XSfTRhwXaa	you should make-out with her in the locker room after swim class. make sure everyone else has gone home and there's plenty of video equipment nearby.|`|46eUq4Ugaa	The secret to getting close to anyone is to spend more time with them.  Make excuses to hang out and do things together.|`|vrkWPCoDaa	Spend quality time, and keep an open mind.|`|43cTto2Caa	have a 3some|`|wWPEIFMKaa	Talk to her, start out with small talk then try to develop a relationship. Maybe you can get her number and text her every once and a while. Invite her to the mall or to the movies or something with just you, her, and maybe a friend. If you decide to bring friends, don't bring many or else she'll feel out of place. She obviously wants to get closer to you, but she's probably shy and wants you to make it known that you want to be close to her too. Just talk to her, maybe find out from her brother what she likes. Maybe buy her a small gift on her birthday or Christmas to show that you care about her and want her as a friend.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|KfpfrO77aa	just ask her what kind of stuff she likes and make jokes with her and talk 2 her about things that happend befor and play with her and if she says shutup say make me and like say hi and when she says hi say y didnt u say hi and stuff|`|S9sZawG2aa	Talk to her. You can start by talking about your boyfriend. Be like, "So, does Ryan have any embarassing stories from when he was little?"  :)|`|AA11908256	treat her like an adult person and do not underestimate her worth. <br>  be direct and tell her you would enjoy developing a relationship with<br>  her...then the ball is in her court|`|ISMColXfaa	Spend more time together and find out what you guys have in common.<br>  Good luckie! :D|`|KaZcKlm5aa	just tell her how u fell.ask her to be more fun.|`|OtDPZO3vaa	Find out what she's interested in and follow that. She's fine and doesn't have to "cut loose" to you or anyone else. That isn't a bad thing.<br>  Look at how many people "cut loose" and end up in trouble or regretting it. She's an individual and likes her comfort spot. You can be part of that, or not. She shouldn't have to change to conform to what you want her to be like...she made an opening for you in her group...fit into that. I'd guess that she likes you and wants to build on the early stages of a relationship, even if it's for her brother's sake. Good big sister stuff there.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Plan a girls' night out with her.  Spend some time with just the two of you to go to the movies and just hang out.
N7UCCGDDaa	no, not at all. i think that if you've worked that hard to achieve the body you have then there's nothing wrong with showing it off. usually girls will just think wow, or he's hot or he has an awesome body etc. i definitely think most girls would agree there's nothing wrong with it.and you won't come off cocky. if you have the body for it then go for it.
NLgEu3YMaa	When i met my gf she was 5 years older then me i told her i was older then her and then after 3 month or tho when she become in love with me and i was sure that telling my age to her will not do any thing terrible i just did and we still 2gether so you just needd use your brain and be your self doesn't metter how old are you me 18 my gf 23 now<br>  <br>  Most important that you should tell her your real age BEFORE she found out her self|`|v3xtB63Raa	Why do u have to act older?? <br>  just be confident and take control of tough situations like when she's freaking out  explain to her how everythings ok REASONABLY, not just saying" its going to be ok"<br>  <br>  I think its cute when my bf acts childish. just sometimes in certain situations tho.|`|OauZKhKVaa	Just keep acting the way you have been acting! If she's been dating you, she must like you the way you are! Age is just a number, anyways.
EhPRMuziaa	I think you should definitely go for it!<br>  <br>  But whether you do or not, I just want to say THANK YOU, for proving to me that some guys actually care.<br>  <br>  It's really hard to believe that sometimes.<br>  <br>  You sound amazing and she would be lucky to have you!|`|BGCiqQFgaa	It sounds like your more of a best friend to her right now rather than a love interest. If you want her attention, be spontaneous! Surprise her!|`|DvET4w2laa	HahahahahHah.. You have no balls.. So how do you pee|`|LOIEEUbcaa	make the moment cute and just ask.|`|M8dazmxbaa	she knows you like her genuis, tell her this i think your beautiful chick but would if we went out would it wreck things between us because i want to stay your friend regardless.  now grab your nuts be man speak up for yours.<br>  .|`|bBVqxQvAaa	i have the same problem but not as Extreme and wow that kid got curb stomped over a paper ball LMFAO.

If she can go to the movie, try and hold her hand, and if she holds yours back then she is obviously into you also.<br>  Then when you take her home walk her to her door and just ask her! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck I hope you can find the nerve to do it and I hope she says yes!!!|`|gYzbuq9haa	ok i have this same problem i don't have the guts at all to ask out some girls  even when people assure me that the girl will probably say yes. I think you should have a special day planned out just make it seem as another day out two friends hanging out and talk to her a bit and tell her you had a lot of fun if she agrees just try to find a perfect time in that conversation to say will you go out with me? but if you've known her awhile it would be a little awkward to go out if you are too close|`|k19eSFNKaa	Man up! just go see her tomorrow and ask her straight out! girls like that. It's nice to know that I guy will stand up for you, but seriously just go ask her:) I hope I helped.....<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  funny way to grab our attention;)|`|AA10731562	yeah man i have the same problem i should really work on that you should ask that girl out to dinner or movie or something|`|WnNpxj0faa	i'm not even going to read this.<br>  <br>  go for it.<br>  you'll regret it in the long run. <br>  <br>  tell her if you can eat 10 tacos in 7 minutes she owes you a date. but if you can't do it. you are not worthy.|`|fabhI1cSaa	Dude!!!!<br>  Ask her. The worst she can say is no and then you'll know..............|`|3oFQQROEaa	You are torturing yourself, just ask her.<br>  It's so tough but why go on Hopeing, find out for real!<br>  <br>  I've done it, been acepted and I've done it and been rejected it.  The rejection hurt, I'm not gonna lie, but at least I knew and my friend was very considerate of my feelings which your frined should be too. Also after I was rejected I really got over the guy fast, the pinning was done cause I knew the answer. <br>  Good luck!|`|CsjhdpJSaa	Wow. Haha. That was alot. But I'm here. :) You have already done more than enough to prove what a greatbf you would be. Sounds like you guys have a GREAT relationship and I'm happy that you are finally going to ask her out! Well, poems/ songs written just for her works for every girl, along with roses and a romantic place. :) Just think of the most creative idea you can. Sit down and take the time to plan everything out. Make it a moment your girl will remember forever. :) Your whole time asking her out shouldn't come from a random person on yahoo answers, so just really think and make it reeeeeeeeaaaaally special. :)|`|Fbi9WYonaa	there was a girl i was like that with before....i hate her now lol because it seems like when your to nice to girls they dont notice. so first i would say stop doing things like getting starbucks when its snowing. untill your her boyfriend anyways. something about doing that keeps girls at a distance. idk. but i would say that one day you just start asking her questions....just normal things like whos your favorite band anyways? eventually work it into more personal things. then ask, what do you think of me anyways? and if she says i think your cute then get the question out of your mouth! and if she says something like well im to shy to say or something that kinda hints she might be to shy to say your gunna have to throw it out or its not gunna happen. um....other than that way.....i would say start flirting if your not to shy and you know how. just say things like "hey dont you look gorgouse today!" and then laugh. idk if thats a good one but i like to joke around when i flirt it makes it seem like it was just a joke if she thinks your dumb. but idk if i helped but good luck and no more starbucks in the snow in my opinion. but dont do anything mean lol
zjGAlILlaa	sorry im not 20 or a guy but.. honestly.. i was like that too and i found it arousing when my boyfriend respected that and just used the time to touch my body all over... like my stomach and neck.. stroking my hair.. it will show her that you can handle it.. and dont think about how much you want it.. just think about caressing her and making her feel good.. she will repay you very soon... good luck hope i helped|`|t25zrCTraa	Well thats a 5 for the undisciplined. It's in a mans very nature for him to thrust so if his body goes by itself he'd still take the fall. I'd probaly say no to sticking my stuff in. It's just kind of stupid. <br>        If we are going to have intercourse we go all the way. Going half way is like a pain in the butt. I'd let her know that mutual masturbation is straight but anything like that is going to set up a problem.|`|frPCw2eDaa	okay will if a girl does that then she's a tease and you should leave her for some normal girl who will let you go all the way.<br>  you can't just like let him go that far then be like ha sorry.<br>  girls like that are just annoying.|`|gRXy66dOaa	LOL<br>  A 5<br>  <br>  but i dnt care.. if she lets me or doesnt<br>  <br>  Im puttin it in weather she likes it or not|`|EgfM5e8jaa	well im a girl and that would be a umm 5.|`|YIlP4yNaaa	If you let him press his penis on your vagina, the next thing you know, he will be deep inside you. If it's his first time, he will probably climax inside you in a matter of seconds.... So, it's pretty dangerous, if you really don't want him to get inside you.|`|lNlL0Ag2aa	I would hold back easily (Rating 1) but I know many other guys will put a 5.

Just think about how cute of a couple you would make.Just don't stop, thats probably a sign that he is really falling for you, and you should see where this leads you.

Do yo thang....there nothing wrong with that, and if I were his girlfriend I wouldn't be happy, but if he has a girlfriend then that whole different story. If he really does have a girlfriend then end it!!! For real, he wont be mad at you, eventually he will either dump his gf for you or not talk to you. Take your chances!|`|p9m0yAYHaa	I would care because I don't believe you should kiss someone else while your dating another person.|`|xH9s9oNdaa	yes, cuz kissing involves no feelings or attraction whatsoever.

Either be her lover or stop doing that silly thing. You are posing a problem to both of your love lifes. And her gf will surely be worried about it.

Sounds like your BF wants to show off his control over you. I think his friend is a perv. Stick to your guns pictures get put on the internet in seconds after you send them. Tell your BF you do not like him when he talks to his friends about you behind your back. Love does not mean you do anything the other wants.

You have to decide.|`|7zbAfWTTaa	how old are? your boyfriend sounds like he's just trying to get some freaky pictures from you. why would his friend say you don't love him over some pictures?  it sounds to me that the problem isn't that his friend thinks you don't love him but that he doesn't really love you and is abusing your feelings by making you feel like your the problem when he's just a little pervert.|`|J0VzIyYjaa	that's so stupid "you don't love him because you won't send him pics over your phone!" wth?

I was 13 or so and my dad was wandering around while I agonized over my AA breasts and my mother constantly throwing bras over my fitting room door and trying to come in to make sure it fit right.<br>  My dad wanders to the entrance of the fitting rooms and says "Would this work?" and holds up a Nevada sports bra in my size. My mom made me try it on and had two sales clerks, her and a friend who had run into us give their opinions. She bought it and made me wear it to every soccer practice and game until it wore out.<br>  I am not embarrassed by her wanting to get extra opinions, I'm more embarrassed by the fact that my father picked out a bra for me!
faeXRQmcaa	Wait and see what happens! Communication is my best advice, he might be going through a rough time without you even notice it.

FZKFLTyLaa	The big problem with a long distance relationship is that they tend to fade, and there's no guarantee of loyalty.<br>  That may very well be what the issue is that's creating an emotional distance to add to the physical distance.
VGkyW5Mvaa	Most schools have rules about public displays of affection, whether or not they are enforced is a different matter.|`|FiCl71flaa	There are rules of conduct even in high school. There are some things that you just can not do in public  though what they are may be different from school to school. Everybody in society has to abide by certain rules like rules at work, on the street, in colleges and universities, in politics, in relationships and romances and so on. School is for learning and is not for romance though it goes on. Find out what the rules are in your school and follow them .Do not think that because you are in high school exempts you from rules which is really at the heart of your piece.|`|6p50zivoaa	Hi.well i can c where he would get detention.he kissed u at school.becarful when u do things like that and who u r around.trust me i would know....|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	It maybe High School but you are still considered young. I know it's stupid because your almost an adult but if you look at it that if everyone was doing it then someone could get jealous and it could cause a fight. If you saw your man kissing another girl what would you do? Or if another guy grabbed you? That are things that they are thinking about. I know I would if my daughter was kissing at school. The best thing to do is find a spot that teachers don't go often and have fun there.

I HAVE TO FOCUS ON MY VIRTUAL REALITY!<br>  <br>  Idiot... sad to say I used to do this but in a much nicer way... lol I would play games when my ex girlfriend would come around, she'd sit behind me and watch and scratch my back and hug me...

BOOORRINNNNG!!! lol<br>  <br>  I haven't played video games forever now... and my wife loves me for it. (different girls) but I think that you should dump him. He obviously loves his games more than he loves you. And he wanted to do a three way?? he's a sicko and doesn't appreciate you. You are justified in being cold to him. Just because he is young doesn't give him an excuse to be a dick... not a pimp... a dick... a pimp is someone who sells women for sex and takes most of their money and keeps them addicted to drugs so he can control them... so help him understand what a pimp actually means before he wants to act like one.<br>  <br>  You don't want to be alone... but I know that there are guys out their that aren't as jerky and will appreciate you more.

Sounds like he's using you sweetie... dump him and move on!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	He's not complicated.  He's immature and a jerk.  You are cold to him because he is exactly that.  He wants things his way and doesn't really care about your feelings.  You can do better.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	i am a man and i never treat my wife like that.ever. ditch the loser you can do better. it will hurt at first but in the long run your better off. you will meet a better person. good luck.|`|YFXusnT1aa	Put him in the trash where he belongs|`|FQxUpc9baa	sounds like u need to put your foot down w/ him. if he's needs to b a pimp b4 getting in a relationship then that your answer about being done. u will and can not change some1 they r who they want to b. i would say take a break for a mth or so then regroup and see what's up|`|uhN7WmXhaa	There is one thing for sure, he is not IN to you as his girl,rather as just one of his mere girl- friends.|`|ivejg4whaa	You deserve better.<br>  Don't settle for less.<br>  Ever.|`|dx0jvNn3aa	u deserve better!!|`|CqCSd6DUaa	whaat, i had a man like this and well he was no man! and he'll never change either! i put up with the video games because i like them too but i heard the girls he got with after me dumped him because he was a gamer. its not romantic, girls need romance and men are pigs.. <br>  <br>  honestly i'd get out and be happy with someone else, im SOO much more happier with my real man now than i was with the other guy.. what guy doesnt like to be touched?!
6S5Md8Itaa	honestly, personality! i was always the type of person to like someone for who they are rather then what they looked like. some people would say why are you with him or why is she with him hes not even cute, but i never cared lol what mattered to me was how he made me feel & who he was as a person. he can be the most gorgeous guy ever but if he has that sh*t personality then im not interested.|`|Y4eEcXLeaa	Any guy can be good looking. They just have to take care of themselves. For example washed and groomed hair. clean face, and a nice sence of style. but Girls like to have both. If the guy is nice/good looking and is really fun to be around girls most likley will fall for them|`|FeEU1IDOaa	Personality, definetely. Looks fade. And if the guy's a jerk, the fact that he was hot when he was younger isn't going to help him out when the hot-ness fades and he's still a jerk.|`|nlQyTrLhaa	Definitely personality. Although looks are a big part of it...of course if I really liked a guy I'd find him handsome xD.|`|pUoAqU3Vaa	well if I notice a guy it's because of looks but if he doesn't have a good personality I forget about it basicly.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	has to be both.<br>  it's really tough to find now-a-days though.
cy9dV7VKaa	waiting is the best tool atm<br>  you will just feel it<br>  the way he looks at you talks to you smiles twitches body language, you will feel it believe me
Qcr0VzvMaa	the "that might come in handy" could mean 2 thing.... that your a backup girl or it might mean that he likes you and he might wanna ask you out and it would be easier to txt you!!!!!!!!!|`|l1DBBxF0aa	sorry to break this to ya but i think that means he just wants to have sex with you. of corse im not a real genius but thats just my thought.|`|7wQGoW3Uaa	um  the guy likes you but hey probly wont say anythign unless u give him a hint u like him. so if u like him then try to hint if u dotn then dont|`|d29M7lGKaa	Rachel, You see all of the above are basically saying the same thing I already told you. Get some self esteem girl !!!
T6PzMyPBaa	maybe you do like him ;D<br>  well if you really don't you could sit down and talk it over so he doesn't get the wrong idea|`|e963e45f4749b09ecd59577b4c08368aaa	Yes, I would have to say it is wrong.  There isn't anything wrong with harmless flirting where no feelings involved on either side but in this instance it sounds like he really likes you and its misleading to give him the go signals when you know he has no chance.  Think of it this way, how would you like it if you had a major crush on a guy, he flirted with you makling you think he was interested but when you finally worked up the guts to do something about it, he told you he was just kidding around?  You'd feel crushed/embarrassed would you?  Well I think he would feel the same in this instance.|`|a8UkcABsaa	Well sometimes it is hard to not be flirty, especially when you know you won't be rejected. Many people, myself included, are naturally flirty people. However, you should make it clear to this poor boy that you don't have any interest in him. Say to him somehow all what you want to say: You're a great guy, fun to talk with, and I've heard that you may think of me as more than a friend, I'm sorry I don't feel the same way, yada yada. But please do this. Rejection is always worse when you never see it coming because you've been led-on.|`|vHjYw1txaa	Yes it is very mean to play mind games and hurt someone on purpose!  Why would you want to be mean, rude and cruel to someone that adores you?  Learn to respect him for how he feels, you might end up marrying a man just like your self.  Then you would wish you were nicer to guys like him.|`|7QDYWAkfaa	um yeah!!  Some girls really don't get thay boys have feelings to.  Maybe even more then we girls do. He will be embarassed and humiliated if he finds out.  Also if other guys find out you lead boys on, they wont wanna approach you.|`|yv3hBhbGaa	yes its wrong to play mind games.|`|WBtifYxDaa	it is if you don't like him. Don't lead him on.|`|aRh4FKUaaa	Yes that's cruel! How are you going to choose a best answer?|`|piuEx0BJaa	Yea its called leading someone on its not very nice|`|M1OJ3oFeaa	yes u shouldnt play with his emotions exspecially since u said he is such a nice guy.|`|AA11447210	Flip the situation around. How would you feel if you were crushing seriously on a guy, you flirted and he flirted back? You'd get your hopes up and start fantasizing about what could happen and getting all excited...only later to find he had no interest in you at all. SMACK. That would hurt like getting slapped.<br>  <br>  It's mean to lead someone on when you know they are interested and you are not. Treat people as you'd want to be treated. It's pretty easy to figure out really...|`|wv9XWQqCaa	No, it's not right. U have to consider the other person's feelings. It's like your playing games with him and also misleading him, which could lead to hurt feelings. If U don't like him, leave him alone, it could backfire on U.|`|4a88b6f3d78184085afa47effba9cfebaa	Yes, don't lead people on - it can be very painful for them.|`|BHpELpEqaa	yes it is. if he really really likes you then you'll break his heart. you should try explaining to him and apologize and ask to be just friends....<br>  <br>  BUT from experience if you flirt back you are attracted to this guy and you do have feelings for him somewhat. think about that before you do anything though.
ISMColXfaa	She's being a bit obsessive.<br>  Talk to her about it. It's the only way she'll stop.|`|AA10287830	You have to be a friend to have friends and your real friends can't be turned against you no matter what anyone says.
Uwb97wCnaa	Definately get her something to show her that your sorry, and honestly talk to her. Forget pride. Tell her that you were stupid and you wouldn't do it again, and if she calls you anything inappropriate, agree with her. Answer all her calls and all her texts. Remind her how much you care about her. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)|`|3c2d62279c0725273058507451c39522aa	Well now the relationship is on her terms. You are lucky she's even letting ya'lls relationship continue.<br>  <br>  You need to show her that your actions now reflect how you feel about her and you do everything with her consciously in mind.<br>  <br>  Text her/call her every night and tell her what you're doing ask how she is. Text her goodmorning in the morning.  <br>  <br>  If you go out with friends and she's not there, make sure you make her aware of your plans ahead of time. If you're going to a party make sure she is invited and if she decides not to go make sure you call/ text her sometime in the middle of the evening and at night before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  Sometimes though, this can all ruin a relationship because she doesn't trust you and if you have to keep checking in with her you may start to feel trapped. But you're the idiot that decided that you wanted to see what else was out there.|`|JQhYc5DVaa	depends wat you did <br>  <br>  but mostly... jus keep repeating that u love her<br>  do 18464884848467867 things to remind her ur sorry<br>  like flowers<br>  bake for her :)<br>  take her out on a date<br>  buy her something<br>  and swear to her that nothing like that will EVER happen again... give her something symbolic to represent ur love for her <br>  <br>  :)<br>  hope it all works out for you :)|`|yv3hBhbGaa	well for me it takes a lot for me to gain someones trust. i have trust issues so give her time and show her that you are trust worthy...|`|KXCZzFpzaa	Long and winding road you are about to go down, my friend. Chances are, she will never trust you as much as she did. Believe me, trust is something that can take years to build but only seconds to destroy, I've been there before and it's not fun. If you really want to be with her, you will have to start being *perfect* for her. No screwing around, no lies, no secrets, don't even think about doing something if there's even the slightest possibility she could find out or get mad. 99% of the time, she will.|`|hvIMKEH0aa	talk to her about everything that went on...<br>  when a boy cries that really means he's serious... you can try tearing<br>  or be like <br>  "Damm i'm so stupid!" <br>  <br>  things like that will make her understand that you really care<br>  and that you won't do it again.<br>  <br>  make a promise?<br>  but don't break it again.|`|1tx9PvzJaa	Answer her calls / txts EVERY time she calls or txts you. Tell her EVERYTHING. When she asks what your doing who your doing it with don't lie about it and when she calls you to check in don't get mad about. Your gonna be on a short leash for a while get used to her treating you like you are 3 years old..|`|F19tOUEdaa	Be perfect. Don't mess up anything or make her mad or suspicious in anyway. If she will listen then definitely apologize. Chances are though that you will just have to wait for her to choose whether you're worth it or not.|`|a716258b4fe2a2084f45b04158d73774aa	yea like seriously, u really need to start remembering to delete things like that out of your phone<br>  <br>  and always remember if ur doing something unfaithful remember that eventually ur gonna get caught|`|xhN2FpTJaa	Lol lie? lol that wouldnt help mmm send her gf some nude pics of you haha jk...... Just do something nice for her get something nice.|`|dbQjXLoXaa	Well I think you should get her a box of choclates and apologize.|`|7QDYWAkfaa	You should have thought about her before you did the stupid thing to be honest.|`|ystqm725aa	what did you doooo?|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	so wat?? not like you love them|`|lyMMjVNgaa	oh b0yyy what did you doooo?
LmH5jZxkaa	it's natural to be nervous! obviously your gf saw something she liked in you, so there is something good there! just be yourself and be polite<br>  <br>  parents love when you talk to them -- it tells them you're mature<br>  <br>  and buses are a breeze, just sit with your gf and nobody should really bother you. if she knows you're uncomfortable she'll be understanding too<br>  <br>  you'll be fine, just smile :)
tU5NJVL3aa	It's O.K. to be hurt, but you really don't have a right to any expectations.|`|qPkygRSRaa	honey its been a year since you 2 were together & you didn't tell anyone that you still liked him.its not really your friends fault.she didn't know.maybe if you had told her she wouldn't have flirted with him.your friend can't read minds.you may be hurt but your friend didn't do this to you on purpose & if she is a real friend she wouldn't have flirted with him if she knew you still liked him.|`|5H64mGX1aa	ouch i know the feeling, it sucks but if its been a year, its time to move on.<br>  has he even been flirting with you?
AA12059817	all of the above...and I try to kind of intimidate women..by looking them in the eye, and holding it for a "weird" amount of time..It's kinda like saying to them.."I know what your about..don't try to lie to me". I can read most women by their eyes..especially if they turn away!.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	maybe because their shy? who knows.
JhvqUvlsaa	Well I would give it a year or so since you are only 13. Say hi when you're over at their house and try to be her friend and see if she wants to be your friend too. Then maybe when you are 14 or 15 see if she's available and interested in more than a friendship (start dropping hints LOL). But for now a friendship only is the best thing and won't mess up your friendship with your best friend. =)

WLsS5vxsaa	Here is a great article on how to get your ex back. Check it out if you want to: <a href="http://www.exbackguides.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbackguides.com/</a>|`|QZSLlAaDaa	I did it. The way I got her back and have kept her (so far) is by doing my best to change the behaviors that she didn't like in the first place... and she has done the same thing. I used to be very jealous, but I learned that jealousy has nothing to do with love - but everything to do with selfishness. I wasn't letting her be herself. We talked everything out and agreed to start over with a clean slate... and you both really have to mean it. Neither one of you can bring up the past problems that you had, and if one of your conversations turns to things that happened in the past you just have to pretend that it happened to someone else...that will allow you to look at things like an outsider. The most important thing is that you have to accept each other the way you are. I think the main thing to remember is that she is the prize. You want to win and keep the prize at all costs - and it's totally up to you! Good luck!|`|BLaEQfdDaa	(EX) me and my ex wife are great friends we had our problems but never talked about them, until after we were divorce crzy I know, we drifted away, work, stress of bills etc. but now we are apart, we learn to talk more, we still love each but we both have moved on, just dating nothing to serious, we have talked abou gettig back so there is another time for us, we just not forcing the issues if and when it happens it will and next time we will know what to do better the second time around. Great friends maybe more later someday|`|mPCNUXLCaa	I had the same experience, just let it happen but be sure to talk things out what seperated you.

Will be paying again this year and probably next. It makes me laugh at what obama was suppose to do in helping the middle class wife and I both work make less then 100k and have 2 kids in college and end up paying all year and then more at the end and this stimulus package seems to help the very poor or the very rich again and us middle class get stuck paying for it all.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Even if you hold separate bank accounts your money belongs to both of you.

It could be one of you is having more taken out each pay check and should get more back.  <br>  <br>  For example IF I have more money taken out of each pay check at a higher rate, but my wife has standard deductions, it could be that my tax return would be 12K and my wife's would have to pay 2K, which gives us a combined return of 10K.  This would mean the entire return is mine and my wife owes me 2K more.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Why don't you simply regards this as income! Don't you have a joint account?

That day I knew how vulnerable she was to the touch of expert hands. She got goosebumps all over her body and her nipples harden to the evident delight of her massage giver. She was 24 at that time, innocent and naive. There was no "happy ending" but I think it was a matter of privacy and time. Would have she been able to stop him from pleasing her were they be in the privacy of a massage booth? That is a question for which I have no certain answer, but I would certainly understand and would never blame her.|`|nOrWOZU4aa	No, I suppose honestly isn't in your DNA, but I'll bet the HIV virus is.  How many men's *** do you suppose was already there?  And you probably touched some of it.

I'll bet she faked it totally, all that bad sex before you couldn't have been an aphrodisiac.  If she tested positive, do you think she would have told you?  Hmmm.  Nah, because your money is more important than your life.  And your spouses.  After all, she didn't make you have sex with her.  Your choice.  Now, sometimes the first sign of getting the HIV virus is a fever a couple days later.  Are you feeling okay?Oops, I didn't answer your question.  No, it is not wrong, you are an adult and so is she.

bu6BhCnpaa	take a really deep breath!<br>  <br>  ok first things first...attractiveness is not ALL on the outside...<br>  place yourself on a scale of 1-10 looks-wise. lets say your a 4 (for arguments sake and based on your feelings about your own looks).  NOW...here is the tricky part.  Your personality and confidence counts for another 1-10 scale.  Right now your confidence is low...and i dont know your personality.  But lets say its a 10.  you average those two scores...so your 4 in looks became a 7 overall.  <br>  <br>  SO what CAN you change...be more confident and be yourself.  There IS someone out there for you...and they will love you...big nose and bald head and ALL.  <br>  <br>  THAT SAID...you need to ask out a LOT of girls to find that ONE.  If you never ask, you will never know.  In the end...would you rather have been rejected a million times and find that special someone to live with, or never have tried and live alone forever.  <br>  <br>  Getting rejected is ZERO fun, but you take a deep breath and you try again, because when someone does say yes, its SO worth it.<br>  <br>  At your age, women are much less judgmental than you might remember from being young, and much less concerned with looks.<br>  <br>  now for meeting women (unless you have someone in mind)...DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT go to a bar.  join a club that involves something that you enjoy.  rock climbing, running, biking, cooking, writing/poetry, ect. ect.  THAT is where you meet people that can REALLY see your personality.  <br>  <br>  LAST but NOT LEAST...go slow.  Don't ask someone to be your girlfriend, dont ask them out on a date.  Test the waters first, and ask a girl out to grab a drink after a meeting, or to grab a cup of coffee.  Its an innocent 15-30 minutes meet-up where you can talk and get to know each other.<br>  <br>  dont be discouraged and keep your head up.  <br>  <br>  no matter waht anyone says there is at least one person that cares about you.|`|bk4yLOjQaa	Pray that you'll find the right girl soon.

I think that maybe before you make a move to ask a girl out, that you strive to make 'friends' with females first to build up your confidence that girls can like you for who you are.  <br>  <br>  Let me say this about your looks....most people are average looking, with a few above average and a few below average.  Even if you truly think you are not that good looking, other people may not perceive you the same way.  And I can honestly say that some of the most wonderful men I have ever met were not good looking guys..but they learned to compensate their looks with a good personality: sense of humor, honesty, loyalty, intelligence, and confidence.

Cause the next day, or after, you can complement him on playing, and whatnot, and you get the idea.|`|0yh3bcjpaa	dont tell him your coming, suprise him and just show up with a friend, u dont want to sit there alone!<br>  <br>  i think its sweeter if u dont say anythng then approach him after the game, he might get nervous if u tell him ur coming and it may mess up is game.|`|ba9aa8b3d71c1e710f4561957c0e0684aa	Showing an interest in the things he likes is the perfect way to get to know him. Why not tell him you are looking forward to seeing him play basketball and that you intend to go to a game soon.|`|3dOqAw8Saa	Go for it...sometimes the female has to show a little initiative to get the guy to make any moves at all.
kIJ09aeaaa	You won't fix it by any move someone suggests.  Talk to him, tell him what you like, suggest a little compromise.  He will probably be glad to get the advice, as long as you don't tell him he is doing it all wrong.|`|3ox4lYu6aa	The only way you are going to ix it is if you talk to him and tell him you don't like it. If you don't tell him then he will keep doing it and he won't know you don't like it.|`|66c3704eb624d447073ee2cabf6a81b0aa	Just talk to him about it in a cool fashion|`|cqTvytt9aa	tell him then give him a verbal explanation of what you want then show him|`|qA4OxDJvaa	u could tell him.<br>  it wont hurt to tell him.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	tell him to back off
GvdH9UrNaa	No, just tell him, I had to tell my boyfriend and he was actually glad that I did. Yes its a tad embarrassing for them and a tad awkward for you , but it'll be worth it in the end when he becomes an amazing kisser, something you both can enjoy! The sooner, the better!|`|fca256c18e2ddc70911db7e7e706e07aaa	well ive been there a couple of times in my life:)<br>  i guess it all depends on THE way you tell them....<br>  but tell yourself THAT even if...the feelings got hurt...well,<br>  you did ,what you needed to DO! <br>  your a person....and you have your rights,your ways,your likes and deslikes....<br>  its normal to ask or tell them that your not comfortable or at ease with somewhat situation...and to try to change it! like me i have a way that I hate being kissed....im so confident that were not alone|!!!!!:):)<br>  but the thing that is IMPORTANT is to talk with the other....|`|swVq0AQXaa	say it<br>  thats normal in relationships<br>  my boyfriend does it all the time|`|7QDYWAkfaa	Just train them how to do it with the way you kiss.|`|szJSaZspaa	i kno my feelings would be hurt but i would still like to kno|`|ukN0Gr7aaa	Just say it straight up, they'd love to hear your thoughts!!  THey're trying to please you anyways.  I'd RATHER them tell me so I could get some feedback.  DO IT DO IT.  Just say, "Try to____blah blah blah more__blah blah blah less_"<br>  <br>  My feelings wouldn't be hurt AT ALL|`|lgMZJQtwaa	heey actully my friend  told this guy that he needs to do less tounge haha well they were just texing adn they were really close and she said can i give you advice and he said sure and she just said ti flat out when you kiss you need to blah blah balah then to make ti a little nicer say what about me any tips?|`|J0VzIyYjaa	it may hurt them but some people may take it as a "oh, now i can make it more pleasurable for you" but you could just try to show them with how you kiss them or if they do something you like you could tell them "i really like it when you do ____"|`|faeXRQmcaa	No, there is nothing wrong with that, it just depends on the way you say it. Make it seem as a suggestion rather than a critique and he wont mind. <br>  <br>  Answer mine: <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtaPN1UC10cA64QC3Vvieqrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304180327AA1zgcH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jRv6X2gIaa	let em kno ....
tXo62R8Naa	i think you should talk to him. communication is the key|`|AA12059817	I wouldn't be very enthusiastic either for a part time lover. He may think you love your lifestyle more than him (by not making time to be with him).
HVu5YGQuaa	wtf lol
Fz0rLnCmaa	Honestly, it seems like he just wants sex. You told him how you felt and what you were worried about and he clearly didn't care much.|`|UyTVXGOdaa	He just wants you for sex!  If you value your pride or your self worth then don't do it!|`|fSFLee8faa	He just wants sex.|`|gRXy66dOaa	just for sex|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	The kid is just using you.  And honestly is this all you feel you are good for?  Just to be some guy's hole?  Get some self respect, its $1.98 at 7/11|`|R0U4qy6haa	you just want to be bed partners with him-so what does it matter-but all he wants is your goodies
ca680a0bfe502b18d07fd78c1a3e2bb9aa	no, darling<br>  he's using you, and its only natural for you to fall for the guy that will hurt you. tell him no, nicely, and if he pursues you with the same purpose with more lies about liking you and leading you on, tell him to bug off. <br>  you don't deserve the pain he's going to bring you.|`|TVEJS83Waa	You cant trust a guy that just wants to be a *** buddy. You cant think that he likes you. You just said that you know he has strong feelings for another girl. He just wants you for SEX! I would try to stay away from the guy. Dont get trapped into his We'll just see. Your so much better than that and i bet you will find someone better than him.|`|ptWHIVjZaa	It doesn't sound like it.  I'm sorry, but it sounds like he cares more about your body than about you.  You shouldn't have to deal with that from anybody, and I would suggest telling him as much so that if he's playing some sort of sick game he opens up his eyes and notices, otherwise, I suggest you say good-bye.  You don't need somebody like that in your life.|`|SQLfPz1Zaa	what the heck, why do you want to have sex with some guy who's just using you. please don't! just think to yourself...how can this possibly end well, he doesn't like me and i have feeling for him, hes going to use me and then i get hurt! not a good situation to get into, tell him to F*** himself!|`|3ojkXjE5aa	i'm sorry if this is a bit too straight forward, but from the way it sounds...it seems as if he just wants to get some *** like a typical teenager. if i was in your position, even though you like him a lot, i wouldn't do it. He'd be using you for sex.|`|f1583d6b39c1a0f2f0b3444dfc6d7c8daa	Um, how about you have nothing to do with this guy. If you see him, walk the other way. Knowing this situation you two will get pregnant and your life with be all F**cked up. QUIT WHILE YOUR AHEAD. Cmon how can you even like a guy like this? You anger me...|`|RmFltNsaaa	NO! THAT IS THE DUMBEST QUESTION I HAVE EVER HEARD! HE DOES NOT LIKE YOU. HE WANTS IN YOUR PANTS.  AND IF YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS STRONG FEELINGS FOR SOMEONE ELSE, THEN WHY ARE YOU CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER HE LIKES YOU OR NOT. HE DOESN'T. GIVE IT UP.|`|pEccQrcTaa	kay neveeeeeeeer ever be a **** buddy with someone. <br>  thats so disrespectful <br>  he just wants to piece you babe<br>  dont do it k <br>  i feel really strong about this subject.. :(|`|S3eWfTqvaa	If you like doing it, then why not?<br>  <br>  Just don't think that you'll get him to like you by doing it. Do it because you enjoy it. (No strings attached!)|`|JHXAtG3eaa	He just wants sex. If he said that is what he wants then that is most likely what he wants. Nothing else.|`|qA4OxDJvaa	nahh if he just wants sex then he clearly doesnt like u that much<br>  if he did like u.. he would've asked u out.. not asked u to have sex..|`|ew1wji3iaa	he doesnt like you he just thinks youz a babe.<br>  if your gonna have feelings for him dont **** him. thats a harrrd road to go down, way harder then not ******* him.|`|03Gssoobaa	he doesn't like you he's just like regular boys there hormones are bouncing off the walls... he's just gonna get pleasure out of you not love<br>  ...?|`|L1r3IcYIaa	Noooo. He doesn't like you. He just wants to have sex with you.

DON'T DO IT. It will look MUCH better on your part if you say "Nah."|`|PzCxpY52aa	NO he does not like you! dont have sex with him , he finds you like his toy to play around with he only finds you attractive. sorry but thats what i'm thinking.|`|UrrRgmDwaa	no he doesn't like you, if he wants you to be his **** buddy. It means he's just horney and he prob. has a few other **** buddies too.  I would say hell no. Even if he starts acting like he likes you he isn't worth it. He's prob. just trying to get some. Messing around with him will get you a bad name in the least, hopefully not an STD. He sounds like he might mess around a lot and 1 in 4 people has an STD. I would find someone who really cares for you. Anyway if you do mess with him and  then he starts dating that chick, you'll feel used and dirty. Nobody wants that, so just leave him alone and move on. Good Luck Honey.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	no, he does not like you, he's being a jerk trying to get you to do that with him.<br>  leave while you can, he's no friend, he's just a loser.|`|euOtDB3Baa	Uh, no way! He's just trying to get in your pants...don't let him!  He's obviously a jerk, so let in someone who really cares about you...then it will be real.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	he is just after your nuggets..dont have sex with him because after sex he will hate you|`|4CqRvxnsaa	He is trying to use you. "F*** buddies" are really prostitutes without pay. <br>  The whole idea of that is really trashy. Have some dignity and stand up to him. Obviously he doesn't care about you and your feelings if he is going to not only ask you to do this but to just blow you off wen you tried to talk about it. Don't let him take advantage of you.|`|41S75G5Eaa	obviously he ONLY wants you for the sex.... i know you really like him but is it really worth it to lose your virginity to a guy that has feelings for someone else and only wants you as a **** buddy??<br>  i dont think so...i suggest you dont do it|`|pqzKlNudaa	She just wants sex, he does not like you. Dont let him use you unless you just want sex too.|`|jrby3atWaa	no hes trying to lead you on and have sex with you DUHHH.|`|TGUoZF63aa	he wants sex. all men do.|`|G8OFN3uyaa	He clearly does.|`|ldvj4m2Caa	Sorry no, he doesn't like you.|`|OK3WueETaa	lol
Ef6Kr1cCaa	My guess is that her lack of response is the equivalent of a long awkward silence...
CTEQMXFwaa	constantly call the home phone
IyvUC47Paa	stop telling people that i like you. i dont
qv25Q4aaaa	same thing here buddy it sucks<br>  <br>  because im a really nice guy so girls usually see me as the "brother friend" which SUUUCCCKKKSSS when you want a relationship.<br>  <br>  i have been really close to a kiss, but it didnt happen because the parents walked in lol|`|azIJoIdIaa	oh sorry. well im a girl and got mine a month before i turned 18. so i would say youre normal.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	I am 20 now... But I was 18 before I had my first kiss. Don't let it bother you! Its uncomon but it happens sometimes. And yeah I was like you, I was popular and had friends and even girls who wanted to date me (just not girls I wanted). It'll happen when it happens.<br>  <br>  Just keep your eyes open and when a girl seems interested don't be afraid to go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck my friend.|`|PO8Vs1oRaa	im in the exact same boat man <br>  answer mine its kind of a similar question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao49v1DSC2oo5TvC1ttkGx3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304183223AAOTR47">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|mc8Regxjaa	The same exact thing I mean exact thing but I'm a girl

hjLzSGV0aa	just be yourself <br>  thats always the best way to keep her interest in you ;]<br>  good luck!|`|Dc1trPN9aa	Yes, but if you make a move too fast, she might find it weird. <br>   <br>  If you become friends, and she has fun with you, she won't lose interest. She get frustrated if you hint that you like her and then wait like two years to ask her out, but being friends for a couple of months first isn't so bad.|`|f1f7IQIKaa	Im just taking notes,dont mind me
NU5U75gWaa	plain and simple it sounds like she didn't get what she wanted when she wanted it so she acting like a spoiled brat either talk to her and resolve it tell he you have to get you stuff done its the #1 priority in your life and id its a problem still than forget it you can do better just talk to her alone and not in study hal and find out whats really going on good luck|`|ntGOF9Wmaa	women are annoying like that, just talk to her and don't PANAC lol
mfcVhbYhaa	I am afraid you kind of picked the wrong boy friend for you.<br>  With such a complicated situation, I doubt your relationship can last like you think. But there is still hope that things can get better if you were lucky enough.<br>  I think you have to talk with the one you don't like and explain the whole thing, I think he would respect you for that. If it didn't work and he is still pissed off and that's possible actually, you will have to try go on with it or ask for your boyfriend's help, he is his brother after all.<br>  <br>  Hope things get better because I am not really feeling good about it :S
nETF5rmJaa	thats absolutley perfect because you are still getting to know each other. and bowling will do exactly that!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Sure, not a bad date, though like someone else said, it would help if he knows the other people that are coming too.  If not, it might be a little iffy, since "groups" aren't always ideal if he doesn't know anyone, might feel kinda awkward.  But overall bowling is a good date.|`|63Af6b66aa	yes it is a good idea you should thanks for the advice for my question and i think its a great idea to go bowling for a first date|`|h23kSIK4aa	sounds like a good idea|`|UBvhTWnaaa	ya as long as he knows the ppl that u r bringing along cuz if he dont know any of them and he is shy then it will be a waste of time
mzHOGgpEaa	Ok this is seriously the like 10th post by you asking this same question. You should stop. Your only 13 who are you trying to impress? Your boyfriend you are probably not going to be with for long? And I'm a bowler and I laugh hysterically when I see non-bowlers looking ridiculous in skirts and clothes that scream IM TRYING TO IMPRESS SOMEONE! Wear something comfy. It's really not that big of a deal.|`|CXxGBQTjaa	I think you are too young to have a BF.....k? and why in the hell.. oh wait I mean heck..."forgot I was speaking to a 13 year old" would you wear a jean SKIRT bowling. hello be sensible.
tObHGRGDaa	okay well you might have the best luck at parties, with a few drinks in you :P honestly thats how i came out of my shell in the 9th grade, once i was known to be outgoing and a flirt (even though I SO WASNT) people saying that i was like that..sorta forced me to act like that without thinking.. its great. um so maybe u can give that a try!<br>  However, if your just at the school scene, the best way to get a girl talking is to ask a question with a lot of possibilites, for example.. a question,.. RANDOM.. "hey i was tlkn with my friend and we cant seem to agree..do u think guys lie more or do girls?" the debate kinda thing gets us talking LIKE OMAN. um also this might help. if you google the comedy network..go on their site and watch a few episodes of keys to the vip.. it might help u out. thats a show about a contest between two guys..which one can pick up the most girls. their pretty damn good. haha good luck! SORRY THIS IS LONG. :P|`|qi34NfWFaa	man up. there just like boys.. just with a vag haha|`|98d8b13abf09d05011a377c36cce50f0aa	im the same way|`|O7NmwYtKaa	try to find somthing in common or look for an apportunity to deffend or help said girl(s).<br>  well first thing is to make sure they like you walk near them or somthing and watch there eyes wait for contact, normaly if they like you the contact will linger a second before she turns away real quick. Now if the girl likes you they dont care for some super special moment wear you say just the right thing, alot of times a simple hey, whats up  is more then enough, then talk about somthing related to her what shes doing/working on try to stay real and down to earth.<br>  seriously just take the first step and the rest should come easy if you just stay calm.|`|81B6fPtTaa	make an excuse, sit next to her, and eventually you guys will be talking.<br>  or talk to people you both know when in a group, conversation would be easier that way.|`|inP5EIysaa	talk about her and mutual interests<br>  <br>  please help me with mine if you got the time?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304170806AAdmXCK&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  -sal|`|KGZO7pN6aa	i agree
AfnQ95Z5aa	Ya, just look at all the effeminate sex symbols out there.  Guys like.... um... ya, I can't think of a single one.|`|AA11447210	Some do...some don't. Just like with any other quality or characteristic.|`|zth3G2b6aa	it really depends...my bf is known to be a little effeminate, but only in his passionate and affection side. however, it is a turn off when guys are too fashionable or consumed with their appearance. i guess guys who are more sensitive really have an edge on the really masculine guys because we girls like a man who can understand and hold us together.|`|8QFj3ADfaa	some girls do and some girls dont it depends on the type of girl.like me for ex. i like funny sweet guys some girls like rock nroll or bad boys.if a girl dose not like you for you then whatev her lost.|`|UrrRgmDwaa	I don't, but I have met effeminate married men, so I guess yes. However, I always suspect they might be a closet gay.|`|HUvcQvQYaa	only as friends. Not romantically though.|`|AN95iBe0aa	to a certain point yeah. that is cool and sometimes better and more sensitive and less clueless then other guys.
RDgyb7W8aa	Sometimes in the heat of moment things happen.  Your respect of her is admirable.  Perhaps in changing what you are doing, set a time limit say 5 minutes on third base.  You gave a hard question but continue to hang out even more.  Good Luck
htWw0OlCaa	Im sure she knows it was just an accident. But it's nice to know that you have feelings about this. I don't know, offer to do her homework, or her chores, any thing like that, and just be there for her. You seem like a good friend. Best wishes|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Just tell her that you're truly sorry, and feel awful about it.<br>  Also tell her that if there's anything she needs to tell you and you'll help.<br>  Thats just about all you can do for her.<br>  Maybe buy her something small like a bear or something, i know it sounds cheesy but buying her something and telling her that your sorry and hopes that she will forgive you should make her smile.|`|26KPiekKaa	Tell her you are sorry. Uh..... that would hurt. I don't think there are anything else to compensate this other than money. Why don't you tell her you are sorry and you won't do this again, unless you're an @$$. You can send her postcards and buy her a few gifts.|`|6RlCp4Jpaa	Well, I would feel HORRIBLE!!!!!!! you could call her and apologize, send her gifts, letters, stuffed animals, and stuff like that.

Wait a second, how wierd is her voice?|`|lXpGlAm3aa	Well,I'm sure it's a unique trait.|`|VkpFImx4aa	Like how weird? Does she have a voice box? Does she sound like a deaf person?

BqqDJXkjaa	It you had just met I would say it's too young. But if you have already been together 5 years and are still happy - I say go for it!. Ignore people who make stupid comments - they've probably been through bad times and think you're stupid.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Go for it if you feel ready.<br>  <br>  I got married at 18 myself.|`|WewCtMpzaa	It's your life, so live it. I will say that if you are 21, and you have been going out since just before you were 16 years of age, you have not really been around. The earlier you get married, the less chance of making it. Not to say you will not make it, it's just that odds are against it in this day in age.<br>  <br>  People are living longer. People change faster, and are actually encouraged to change. Careers will come, all kinds of opportunities, and stuff you could have never predicted can happen to you that can change everything.<br>  <br>  There is something else... This is probably your first love, and a very real love. It's absolutely wonderful. It's also has something to it that I think most have to endure at some point in their life to really understand love, and I mean feel it, not just take it as the glue that keeps people together. You really have to lose someone you really, really love to understand what it means to you. It's very powerful emotion, and when you don't know what you have, you can do a lot of silly things with that love. I cannot even describe what it's like to go though, but I can guarantee you probably have not suffered that one, unless you had a parent die suddenly or something traumatic happen like that to kind of know what I am talking about.<br>  <br>  I was in the same boat as you actually. We got engaged after five years, she was the same age as you. She got a shot to go to grad school, and about six months later she was ready to downgrade the relationship.<br>  <br>  This may not apply to you, but I can remember people telling me the same thing, and I thought I knew what they were talking about. It made sense to me. Then came the end of our relationship, and well after the fact, I realized I knew nothing.<br>  <br>  The good that came out of it was that I found someone that was actually better for me. It kind of reminded of a Garth Brooks song about Unanswered Prayers. I also woke up to realize all my insecurities and issues that use to bother me were gone, mostly jealously. I was a jealous person starting out, and now jealously is such a non-issue. So although in my case, it was a great former relationship and one I thought we would be together forever, it was not meant to be, and something grew from that which made me a better person, better husband and lover. <br>  <br>  It was a rough ride, but it was worth it. It's funny, yet scary to think that someone in my condition is coming up the same path. I am not saying it will end this year or the next, but I do believe everyone has to go though life, so we all have those challenges in our lives that darn near wipe us out.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and hope you remember me when and if what I said hits. It did for me for the few who point some of this out.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	There is no reason to get married young. If everyone is supportive, that's great, but you have plenty of time to get married. Do whatever feels right and enjoy it.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	If your in love with each other them live your life with the one you love.|`|QSodlfMraa	you should not listen to random people they had nothing to do with your life. go a head girl congrats|`|lg6jexk7aa	Nothing - their opinions don't really matter.<br>  <br>  If it was 50 years ago (hell maybe only 20 years ago) they would be asking - "What is taking you so long to get married?"  <br>  <br>  People just like to pass judgement on others - and that is all they are doing.  I think that your ages and time together is perfectly acceptable.|`|T8fZOmdOaa	Tell them to mind their own business!!<br>  You're old enough to make your own decision, and you ahve been with the guy a long time!<br>  It's not like you're 17 and met him months ago.<br>  And if your families are supportive that should be enough as their opinion should matter more then anyone else's.<br>  <br>  Just be happy, enjoy what you have and tell them to get lost!|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	People can be horridly wicked, if you have the support and love , you'll do fine.|`|xNF04OfJaa	Go ahead and have a super wedding if you two are ready that's what counts!

FZKFLTyLaa	Maybe his battery went dead, or he had to go do something else.<br>  Give it time.
QR6JmD4Haa	Sometimes people just aren't close with their parents. It's fine, and perfectly normal. Honestly, though, you're going to get picked on and the "awww" every time you have any kind of relationship (I would know about that, I have 3 older brothers). You should probably start with your mom, because you're both girls. Talk to her about a boy you like (or make one up) just to get things rolling, and move on to other things. Being close to your parents can be great, but sometimes it can feel like they're TOO close, so be careful.|`|U5dCFomCaa	OMG that is like me. all my friends go out basically whenever they want but my parents want me to stay home. i barely go anywhere over the weekends although i always get invited. and my friends have boyfriends and they go places with them, so i'm like "don't your parents get suspicious?" idk. and my friend always go places by themselves. they take the light rail and the bus! my parents wouldn't let me do that! and i'm already old enough. when i get my license i'm going to sneak out[=<br>  jk but seriously, i feel your pain!<br>  <br>  you're scared. i am too. i always told myself i'd tell my mom who i like. i said this before, "i'll tell my mom who i like when i turn 9". hahah that was like 4th grade. never happened. and dude, me too. i don't tell them anything. it just weirds me out. idk why.. but me and you have the same situation i guess|`|3rqd6N29aa	My parents and your parents must be like the same people or something.  What i always did was offer to do something extra to the things i already had to do everyday( chores and such).  That helped a lot.  Or tell them that you never get to go places, and that things arent always gonna be planned, and you just want to have fun.  Other then that, you might just have to live with it =[<br>  <br>  About the boyfriend thing.  I NEVER told my parents about any of them.  If they found out, then id tell them what "needed" to be known, other then that, its your business.  If you dont have good communication with them then its gonna be hard for you.  Its prolly how it was like with me,  They drilled me and asked stupid questions, and it just made me wanna choke them.  Talking to them was impossible.  Im just a "free spirit" i guess.  I always took care of myself really. <br>  <br>  Just keep living, and see if your friends can pick you up.  I worked out deals with my friends parents.  Like id give them 2 bucks to pick me up, or more if we were going far or if they lived far.  Dont feel nerdy or whatever for asking, im sure they'll understand.

jH7NroYjaa	Well, the 90s are an interesting era for fashions. The early 1990s was a fashion called "grundge"- ripped jeans, black hoodies, corn rows, darker make up: this was from about 1993- 1996. From about 1990- 1993 (sorry, I'm going backward), it was watered- down late 80s style (AKA, the hair wasn't as big). 1996- 1999, was an era of more classy fashions- a little bit of 1920s meets 1960s. Mesh made a comeback during this time along with beige lipstick with darker liner (for make up)- it's hard to describe. Try watching American sitcoms that started, went through or ended in the 90s- that'll give you a good perspective. Also try googling 90s fashions, but it seems it's not far away enough for archivists to care.<br>  For accessories, make sure everyone has a tamigochi (sp?) or some pogs, maybe throw a little Sailor Moon figurines in there. Make sure to play Nirvana, The Cranberries, Love Inc, The Spice Girls, Vitamin C, All Saints and Alanis Morisette. Serve Pop Tarts, Fuzzy Peaches and Sour Patch Kids. Have a good 90s day!

4o3jXz3Waa	So let's say you don't save yourself for marriage.  Then what?  You just have alot of meaningless sex?  Risk contracting an STD?  Risk getting a girl pregnant which will throw a kink in your school/career plan (since no contraceptive is 100%)?  What are you really gaining?  The ability to brag to your future wife about all the women who came before her?<br>  <br>  Ultimately your decision has to be based on your own values and desires.  It can't be based on someone else, such as, maybe my future wife will have been around the block a million times already. <br>  <br>  Sex doesn't have to end when you have kids.  I have been married 14 years, have two stepchildren and a daughter with my husband.  We still have sex on a regular basis and yes, we actually still enjoy it too!  Forget the "stereotype" of what people say happens when you marry and have kids.  Choose your own path and create your own future.  Don't expect to live a life that someone says you will probably end up with.  Very closed minded people do that, so don't be one of those people.<br>  <br>  The best of luck to you!|`|6cm6MB66aa	Yes you are . Your at your sexual peek right now for a guy at 18 . We must have been made that way for a reason . At your age sex is very intense and pleasurable its hard to deny yourself . Its all so very easy for a guy to get off if its climbing the rope in gym a woman brushing against you or even your pants rubbing . A man at your age has to relieve himself one way or another or face the dreaded blue balls . <br>  <br>   I agree you would be lucky to find a woman at the age of 30 still virgin . We was given that pleasure we was also given the pleasure of sight, taste ,smell and touch . You don't deny those do you ? Just don't over do it like you wouldn't over eat or stare at the sun .|`|SI67vQNuaa	I think the problem you are facing is a self-made problem, basically you are putting a huge restriction on yourself by saying you cannot marry until you are 30.  I think you are trying to be too logical about love, marriage and sex, and the problems you are facing are all self made.  Just ease up on yourself here.  If you meet a girl you like, date her.  Don't stress over the sex part.  Not every girl wants sex right away, they like to date too without that pressure.  When you meet the right girl, no matter when she comes along in your life...you will want to be with her...debt or no debt.  The two of you just work it out, all couples do.  It will all work out, promise!!! :D|`|bO2rzfISaa	Unless you're a religious zealot it's a waste of time to wait. Protect yourself and attend to the emotional realities of sex for yourself and your partner. Then have sex.<br>  <br>  Women who love sex don't quit during pregnancy. I had sex throughout each of my pregnancies including the day of delivery all three times. You anticipate the sexuality of a woman who chooses to remain a virgin. Choose a woman who loves sex too much to do without it instead. <br>  <br>  Our bodies are designed to want sex. Some people choose to squelch that desire because they feel it's morally wrong. I think they're wrong.|`|AA10065812	?????<br>  You had plenty of answers, many good ones.

he3O1RFUaa	I don't look when guys check me out because I'm a little scared of rude comments. I've noticed in the past that if I happen to make eye contact the guy will look at me in a manner I find to be way to intense, and will sometimes make a sexual comment. <br>  <br>  Having said that, it is sometimes nice to be checked out and can boost my confidence a bit.

Rzsudrzqaa	You can't convince her of anything. I think your idea is a great one (even if you can have bio children). But there is something primal in a woman (men too) that has the desire to procreate like all other animals. I think your stance is wonderful and maybe she'll come around but maybe (when you two are ready) you'll give her a shot at being pregnant with medical help. If you can afford it at least give her a fighting chance, or she may resent you. <br>  <br>  I don't know its hard. There really are sooooo many kids out there in need of a home. Damn I wish I was more helpful. I'm indecisive myself, on this issue. Its definitely not a black and white issue there is a lot of gray area here. You two are going to have to talk about it... if you're unable to talk about it... then you're better off not having any (at least not now).|`|tZUSVuUvaa	It's possible that her views might change later. At any rate, there probably isn't anything you can do about it right now. It sounds like you aren't actually trying for a child yet, so if it turns out that she isn't able to conceive she may warm up to the idea of adoption at that point. I would just wait for now and see what actually happens fertility-wise instead of pressing the issue. <br>  <br>  I have PCOS so I understand how stressful the idea of never being able to bear children can be. I had a miscarriage with my ex and I am single now so even though I am worried about waiting much longer to start trying, I will still have to wait to find out whether or not I will be able to have children. I had planned to adopt two or three children when I was older no matter what so the idea of being sterile is less traumatic to me than it might be to other women, but it still really bothers me. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you both!|`|ce8kACW4aa	you both need councelling you both have major issues to patch up i call it build a bridge and get over it|`|ByUS0k8waa	We have tried to have a baby for three years and just had our 2nd miscarriage. We couldn't get pregnant for three years and when we finally got pregnant we lost three babies in three months because of two miscarriages. We are now 23 yrs old and know that we cant have a child. Also you should let her know that she only has a 33% chance of getting pregnant each month and alot of women who think they wont have a hard time getting pregnant end up not being able to have a child. The only option we adoption now. I thought that it would easy and it ended up Im 23 years old and cant have children. My body wont allow me to carry a child.<br>  <br>  You should tell her to look into how common infertility issues are. They are more common then she probably thinks. No one in my family had a issue with fertility or women issues. So its a very real thing. She should think about the fact she can still be a mother. Its very hard for us to adopt because we spent the money on the fertility treatments.

But for your girlfriend to know that you would rather have you ex-girlfriend in your top friends, then have her feel more comfortable and secure in your relationship is obviously a big blow.

I think you are just tortuing her.

BdlGBdE5aa	How do you know that you did not have bad breath?  All people have some amount of bad breath because most bad breath is caused by bacteria on the top of the tongue that produce foul smelling compounds.  Sometimes you can see this bacteria as some white stuff, especially on the back of the tongue.  This white stuff must be removed to get rid of bad breath.  Mints and gum just cover up the bad breath for a very short time.  Also, most people cannot smell their own bad breath but we can smell the bad breath from others.  I use an OraBrush tongue cleaner.

It sounds  as if you  started  an affair  with this  guy breaking his  previous relationship up.

I stayed friends with my ex, he remarried, I'm friends with his new wife, I help her, she helps me and we're all happy. We're all over 40 so maybe we're more mature and that is why. <br>  <br>  So, I think you have not given us enough information. What are in these emails? is it platonic or he's romancing her? why does he keep it secret? I have a feeling he keeps it a secret cause you're the jealous type. How about you invite her over? get to know her. Show her how the both of you are in love etc. Are you confident enough to do that?<br>  <br>  Anyway, this was my 2 cents.|`|RzaP9bQmaa	Have they got Children together? <br>  <br>  Your husband may be caught in the middle here.  He might still contact his ex because they might have left on good term's and felt that they could stay friends. (It happens) <br>  <br>  Of course his ex is going to have a little bit anger towards you, you are married to her ex-husband. I don't think it has anything to do with you and your Husband having a child. You have to expect the Ex to have some sort of bitterness to the "new women" <br>  <br>  I think your husband is trying to keep you and his ex both happy, and just make a easy life to him self.  <br>  <br>  You may have to learn to live with it, if he is doing nothing wrong. <br>  <br>  The end of the day your husband comes home to your bed and has a family with you. Tells you that he love's you.  Have you had any doubt to question this?|`|ecdaf4ee0603201b08c5598b1ee9c0b2aa	I think the majority of people above are getting confused about the issue here, you dont have a problem with him being in touch with the ex, its the lying and sneaking about that is the problem.  When they do lie and sneak about then its going to make you wonder whats going on for him to be like this.<br>  I was in this situtation once, and no matter how much I didnt mind him being in touch with his ex he still kept it from me.  If I could turn back the clock now I would not have stayed as long as I did.  But you are married with a child so I'm not sure what to suggest.<br>  I'm sorry I dont have an answer but I do hope you works things out.  Good luck.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	So you are picking his friends.  His ex can still be his friend.  If you are going to not let him communicate with his ex then he should be allowed to make you stop communicating to Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  Every relationship/friendship brings out a slightly different side ourselves.  Maybe in part he likes the side his ex brings out in him, but not enough to stay married to her.<br>  <br>  Relax take it easy and just keep an eye open.  Value what you have instead of looking for the problems.|`|AP2e90cCaa	He may be acting defensive because you're persecuting him.<br>  <br>  Try to have a calm conversation where you don't accuse him of anything.<br>  <br>  Why can't he contact his ex wife? Clearly he's married to you now, so what gives? E-mailing someone does NOT mean he's cheating.<br>  <br>  If you've tried to put aside your jealousy, which is a seriously erosive quality btw, and you're Still feeling uncomfortable then tell your husband your feelings. If he respects you he will stop. If he doesn't respect you then you shouldn't be married to him. Give him the benefit of the doubt first.|`|713d09d4e24b6e6ced1f1de7fff7fc4aaa	Grow up.  He is with you and far better he is in touch by email that physically.  They obviously have a past together and sometimes just a reassurance that the other person is getting on OK is enough to ease worries.   She may not like you but sounds like you do not like her either.  Make sure your husband is happy at home with you and your child and put the past behind you.|`|HE56Jra6aa	Confront her.... If she can tell you the truth about why he is contacting her.Ask her everything all about the emails... If she denies, then just simply say, i am filing for Divorce and you are being named as the other woman. You just may get more info on your situation than you think. Just be ready for it, It may not be what you want to hear.<br>  Good Luck.|`|pISkFd9baa	do they have kids 2gether if so they still have to stay in touch?they both might still be in love or have feeling for each other?my hubby dosnt listen to me over his ex wife it does my head in i think i am talking to the brick wall then he wonders why we argue,wat was the reason he said he emailed her for?|`|lzooHi0Baa	Find it in your heart to figure out what to tell him.   The answer lies on how much you can tolerate his disrespect and rebellious attitude.  We all have a measuring tape for putting up with others' b/s.   Mine is a fraction of an inch.   Others are yards long.   I could never be with a man that talks to another woman behind my back, specially an ex.  I would say "you have 24 hours to get the hell out of my life"|`|2NUJsWIoaa	I think operamemartexpo is right about everything! If you find that you aren't communicating very well right now Why don't you try and write to him?<br>  <br>  Don't let all the stupid answers bother you. These people have never been in proper relationships with commitment. You have and you are fighting to keep it that way! WELL DONE!!|`|FzFSzilmaa	depends how long they were married... now that they are split, nothing to say they can't be friends... except for you and your jealousy and insecurity...<br>  <br>  and the reason he doesn't tell you, is because you obviously over-react...|`|CssyQVD0aa	Sounds to me like she's gettin a bit of the bone that you should be chewin on.|`|2nsNvIanaa	u sed it all he cheated on his 1st wife. take yr kid n find a new life let them hook up n cheat again.|`|AA11803994	Sorry to hear about your dilemma. This guy should not be talking to his ex-wife at all. Period. I was going to ask if he had reason but you already stated that he doesn't. They don't have any children together. He shouldn't be cultivating any kind of deep relationship with those of the opposite sex. And this is out of respect for his relationship with you, his wife, plain and simple. (I am not saying he can't talk to women - just not to have deep relationships with them-no married man should.)<br>  Unfortunately, if he is defending his relationship with his ex-wife, then you have your work cut out for you. That's not a good sign. <br>  <br>  I would let things cool off for awhile - don't bring the issue up again. Instead, I would highly recommend finding a marriage class that you can both go to. They have some at different churches. My husband and I went to one called Marriage 101. It's not a counseling class. It's just informative and it talks about how to deepen your relationship with each other on an emotional and spiritual level. A man taught our class and I thought it might be boring but it worked wonders for us. I can tell a difference in how my husband treats me - he's more in tune with my needs - and I am more supportive of him. It also helped having a man teach the class, instead of a woman, because it was like he was telling my husband "man-to-man" how to be a better man. <br>  The fact that your husband has had affairs before while he was married to his previous wife is not a good sign and it sounds like he is cheating (whether emotionally or physically) on you as well. You have every right to be frustrated, angry and hurt.<br>  Sit down and talk to him calmly when you feel there is a good time to do it. Talk to him about how it makes you feel as your wife to know that he is having a relationship with his ex-wife. Ask him what he thinks. If he loves you, he'll want to work it out. If he blows you off then I would take your child and have nothing else ever to do with him again. Set your standards high and don't let him take advantage of you. If you don't set the standard for yourself, no one else will.<br>  What he is doing is grounds for a divorce. Best of luck to you!
bu6BhCnpaa	I am having trouble seeing where your problem is.  I understand that you struggle with finding a balance.  But I am sure that he thinks the world of you.  If you talk things out with him, im sure he would feel bad for making you feel that way.|`|i1AsTUG0aa	well isnt sexual attraction the basis of a healthy romantic relationship. Maybe you just need to talk more, have some more 1 on 1 time at dinner or shopping, etc. so you can really get to know each other. Have fun!
0udjgaoBaa	I moved out at 19 with a child.So sorry I dont feel your pain I hated living at home too and I did something about it..Now im 29 I haven't had to move back home because I did what I had to do so that I wouldn't. Get 2 jobs instead of just sitting there with your siblings then you wont have to get yelled at and you can save up money to move out.|`|AA11380378	That was my stuation years back. I had two younger bratty sisters that couldn't do no wrong, had bad grades, did whatever they wanted, but not me. They spoiled them I got nothing because "I was working and made my own money". So unfair.<br>  <br>  **SIGH** I can relate and trust me, I really sympathize, but I do not have any advice for you. I'm really sorry. Continue wuith your education and carrer goals and you will soon make enough money to be independant.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!|`|1EhbLBkUaa	If you don't want her help, then get yourself in a position where you don't need it anymore.  Find a roommate and move in with them, so that you can split the bills.  Find a better paying job, or a second job.  Don't borrow money from her and don't give her money (unless it's something you agreed upon, such as rent money to cover your expenses as living there as an adult; in which case, it's her right to do with it as she wants once you give it to her).|`|JCozkN7faa	I have been in that situation but my brother is 34 and doesn't have a job! When I did I always had to give my money to my mom but when he did he never did! Its unfair!<br>  <br>  I have wanted to move out too and can't cause I don't have money.  You should tell your mom your feelings and if she doesan't listen(like mom) just ignore everyone and then hopefully you can find someone to move in with or save up so you can move.|`|oOEaudwvaa	Sit down with her and tell how you feel in a claim manner|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HI JESS,,,HONEY,,I THINK I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR A ROOM MATE,,,URE TWO SIBS,,,NEED TO FIND JOBS,,,CAUSE AS LONG AS U STAY WITH MOMA,,,U WILL KEEP PAYING N PAYING,,,,PEACE|`|WWjnR5GCaa	Of course the babies get everything.<br>  You should talk to your mom, and if she wants to borrow money, make her tell you her whole day plan, and what she is spending the money on. If you get yelled at because they start fighting, tell your mom what happened. Maybe find a roommate to move in with for a while and split the payment. I know how you feel.<br>  Hope this helped!|`|NuPwR75Jaa	Im so Sorry, it sounds horrible. I don't think there's much you can do but just stick it out and save up until you can move out. There's light at the end of the tunnel. Good Luck. (:|`|xCfHnQBbaa	OMG you're 20 years old get a job and move out. If you can't afford it on your own get a roomate!|`|IMPh53Ssaa	Maybe you should just tell her|`|dK2Zv21Daa	You are temporarily bruised.  in time you will find that changes come to those  who wait as well as those who run.  Start saving your money on a pay by pay basis  I mean every cheque.  Practise not borrowing , but still give  when you have it to do so.  I got an instant picture of  your situation just by the story you told  continue with your schooling and never allow hate to enter into your heart  cause you will need mommy regardless of who you are  or how great you become Love them in spite of it all and in time you will reap all the benefits of LOVE.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|djUMvICoaa	Here's the scoop, you have two younger siblings who get away with everything.  Mom got tired of chasing after them and is taking it out on you.  It's easier for her that way, you don't yell back.  But it has also made you a doormat, they keep using you and they take your money because you let them.  There is nothing that says you have to give it to them.  Start a special stash right now where you put 10 or 20 or whatever you can aside for now.  In a short time you will have enough to move out and you can also start talking with others about a roommate, it may be easier to find one than you think.  Staying in this situation any longer will end up bringing you down to their level.  I'm sure you're going to need some help to overcome the scars you already suffered.  good luck
AA12269103	I dont think theyre right/wrong/stupid/smart/tough,I just think theyve never really FELT love.<br>  Because when they do,guaruntee theyll never say they dont need it again.|`|lf6tjzK4aa	I think your main concern should be whether or not you need love. Who are you to judge what other people need or don't need right? You're certainly not in their head. You don't know what they feel about love. I think people like to feel close to others, and I think your question has an air of self-righteous judgment passing that is counter productive to the fulfillment of that desire.|`|YjkXyHBuaa	they're been hurt before.<br>  really really badly.<br>  i know because i say the same thing sometimes. :[<br>  i want to believe i don't need love, but i do.<br>  & i wish i didn't because it's only gonna make me get hurt.
b3zGfYMpaa	Even a guy thats madly in love with you can stray, so I see where your coming from..never count your chickens! Relationships are unpredictable, sh*t happens and we dont know why..people change. That is not to say that you cant prevent this from happening to some degree. The key is to keep things interesting and fun, guys get bored easily and they always love a challenge. So do different things and make sure your alternating between the things you like to do and the things he likes to do...this way the relationship is never one sided. Be honest and just be yourself. If you remain the same girl he fell in love with, you'll better your chance of keeping the relationship on track and the right one at that. Also, I see to many girls throwing out their make-up and dressing down when their with their guys..this is a big NO-NO in my book..always look hott and let him know its all for him!|`|AZcohhItaa	No your just getting the wrong guys. Just go for the guys that are into a serious relationship and if there is none then just wait awhile when you get a bit older and find more mature guys.|`|sp7yqqKNaa	ALWAYS try new things, thats my biggest problem, well date for 2 or 3 months and conversations will just dry up, nothing interesting really so always do new things, doing old stuff every now and then is fine, but routine is bad|`|uFmrZbCbaa	The secret that has kept me with the woman I am very lucky to have is keeping things new.

jH7NroYjaa	Kate, you could not be any more wrong, the rate of virginity is actually higher than back in the "Free Love Era" when the pill first came out- THAT is why there is such a high rate of STDs- you can thank the Boomer generation for that.

She needs to be noticed by literally every male in the room.  <br>  <br>  She constantly talks about how "sexy" she is and how everyone loves her.  <br>  <br>  <br>  It didn't help that when we were kids everyone made her think she was something special.    Now she is divorced because of all the numerous affairs she had...her ex-husband was a decent guy and she treated him terribly.   <br>  <br>  <br>  She thinks that she is "hot" and that makes it OK to be narcissistic.  <br>  <br>  <br>  It is a sign of immaturity and insecurity.|`|tX2PIgiXaa	No. They ruin all the fun and have to be the center hah and get mad over the gayest things like if we dont invite that person with us WWIII starts.

MDa6OA0Caa	Try going out with a group of friends from work and see if he wants to come.  Then try and talk to him while you are out 1 on 1.  Maybe he just doesnt want to be dating right now for unknown reasons.  Or maybe he just is scared being that your 20 and he is 25 that you are too young.  I dont agree but some men think like that.  They want someone who is more mature.  If he sees you out though maybe he will realize you are fun and cool and show him you are mature for your age and he will like you.   However do not throw yourself at his mercy.  There are plenty of fish in the sea and looking desperate is bad.  Good luck hun|`|e7lieLbkaa	gal..... my advice is jus ignore him......u know ignoring really helps show him ur attitude show him that u dnt care wn he is thr talk to him but donot ty to grasp his attention by doing things fr him..... n u know he will surely notice the change n as u said he said that he knows that u love him and he takes u fr granted he dosnt talks to u dsnt reply to us msgs n on odr times he flirts wd u he is having his own will wn he likes he talks to u n wn he dsnt like he dsnt talk to u jus ignore him n thn wait fr his rxn if he really notices he will cm to u himself.......|`|b79281394f26d2628c17365fc5559ae3aa	Act like you don't care anymore.

tXs2meLPaa	My boyfriend and I met over the internet. we live 3 000 miles away and have been together (in real life) since November. We talk every  day over the internet and visit each other for two weeks to one month at a time.<br>  First step for you would be to go ahead and meet him in real life, then you can see how comfortable you feel with each other and if the relationship has any future. If there's love you will make it work :)<br>  <br>  cheers and best of luck|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	See each other on the weekends, keep it exciting and less burdensome by meeting 1/2 way and stay at a hotel and spend time exploring the town you're in together, plus it can be your special place. At some point one of you will make the move either here or there.  Just keep things interesting and you don't have to talk everyday.|`|KPwaKnHuaa	alright! wel i was in your shoes!!

ApstAr1Raa	its perfectly normal.|`|BPqK0c5taa	I guess it depends on your age and how much younger. I'm 19 but I am attracted to girls as low as 16. My girlfriend right now is 16 and shes quite amazing. I don't find anything wrong with it at all. Now if your like 27 with a 16 year old that's a bit different.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	no, it's perfectly alright.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..I suppose it depends on how young the women are respectively....wouldn't you agree?|`|nd4hUE36aa	OMG A COUGAR!

How old is this older person?|`|swV3SIw7aa	how is this taboo...?<br>  um thats usually normal...<br>  oh wait<br>  unless the guy is like 70 and trying to date 19 year olds<br>  x______________X<br>  THAT sir is wrong<br>  ><|`|fLM3rpq2aa	Well,i don't think it taboo,people should talk about that, it"s wrong if guy is 50 or 60 year older than girl.|`|ReaD6u4paa	its normal ...when i am going to be 50 i will try to date 18 yo girls :)
pVnUhYLQaa	"But then when she gets home she tells me 11 of the guys that danced with me were creeps. One tried to go up my dress, one was about to kiss me one was kissing my neck. Then I get all pissed off and she wonders why"<br>  <br>  She doesn't wonder why; she's telling you that to piss you off.<br>  <br>  You are jealous, insecure, untrusting and lacking confidence. In my experience, all of these traits are a turn off to girls.<br>  <br>  Listen, a girl is either going to cheat on you or she is not. If she has it in her to cheat, she can do it at work, she doesn't need to go to the club. So you either trust her or you don't. If you don't, then why are you with a person you can't trust? You obviously don't think enough of her to honor her commitment to you, so move on from her. Although, I'm sure you'll be the same way with every girl you're with.<br>  <br>  The way I look at it, I trust first until she gives me reason not to, in which case I move on from her and don't lose a minute sleep over it.|`|bVROvLNSaa	You told her what you thought of her clubbing, she is disrespecting you by continuing with that behaviour.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you tell her once more that you don't like her going out to clubs and then say good-bye to her.  This is not going to change.  The drinking before she goes should be a red flag.<br>  <br>  Get out while you can - this chick is NOT a keeper.|`|gqvvXknQaa	I can see that this relationship is going to have problems if she keeps acting like this. If she is going out on a "girls night" then that's what it should be. She shouldn't be dancing with other guys, especially after you stressed that fact that you don't like it. And for he to tell you afterward what these guys has done to her? That is VERY disrespectful to you! Tell her that is she is going to be going out to clubs, getting drunk and dancing with other guys then she might be better off single.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Sound like she wants more attention from you. Tell the about guys night out and add some juicy pointers of your own, see how she reacts, maybe that what she is doing to force you to break it off. Don't go to the point of crossing that final line but, something to think about is.. how many girls while clubbing stopped you short of a happy ending. About 11? is she not telling you about #12 or #13. Its always at their discretion on who "gets in" . <br>  I would Bail Out, and cut my losses.|`|liHpJvVfaa	It's not right what she is doing. She should not even want all these guys all up on her. I know I would never do that to my boyfriend. I think you have every right to be mad. This is already hurting your relationship and she really does not seem to care. <br>  You need to sit her down and have a serious talk with her. If she still wants to go out and party after hearing how you feel....Maybe it's time you let her go. You deserve better than that.|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	she likes the attention from men she gets on the dance floor or anywhere else---and she's not going to stop b/c she needs it for her self-estemm. she's just going to be a problem for you|`|5qUUP1Rsaa	Hi dude, your girlfriend seems to really enjoy clubbing. However, maybe you should find one day and sit down with her to tell her the reasons why you are angry about her going clubbing. Explain to her about your feelings and tell her that you don't want other guys to take advantage of her while she's there. Try to sit down and talk about it as she may see that you do care about her.|`|AA11452969	i think you should go out too. thats the best way..but im not saying for you to do something bad like flirting and dancing with other girls. you know, a simple get together with the boys. i think your girl is too confident becuz she knows you dont do things like that. for sure she is just being honest with you and not to mean u harm but then she isnt sensitive enough that shes hurting ur feelings. I know u dont want to stop her for what she enjoys doing. But then if she love you enough she should be sensitive enough to compromise and lessen her clubbing nights.|`|GsznYH3Raa	get rid of her she don't care what you think     or find out where she is going and show up and start dancing with her like she says all the other guys do get all up on her she will porb get real hot and take you home and fu-k you all night|`|FQxUpc9baa	i would have to tell her if that is the lifestyle she wants or need then i'm not up for it and tell her u r thinking about a break from her. clubbing is not a bad thing if u know your boundaries|`|KR1FdEZgaa	move on you do not need those problems. she is not worth it. there are good women out there. i am 44 next week. i went through several bad girlfriends before i met my wife. now i am happy.|`|u2RrglPiaa	i can understand why you are worried. However, you need to give her a life, and let her go clubbing, although let her know how you feel about guys dancing. But really, its up to her. Good luck ***|`|YFXusnT1aa	Don't yell at her bad move. Ask her if a woman touched you the same how would she react.|`|bfeQ3miMaa	This happened to me once before and I didn't like what I found out.  If I were you, find out what club she and her friends are going to and show up there about two hours after she arrives.  Do not approach her, just watch a little from afar.  If nothing is really going on, then leave.  You have your answer: she just likes having a little too much fun.  If something is going on that you are completely not cool with, I would still leave, and if you feel strongly enough about what was happening, I would break up with her on the Friday.  I know it sounds like stalking, but as you described, she is not being very truthful either.  Hope that helps at least a little.|`|ivejg4whaa	Your girlfriend is not respecting you. Respect goes both ways. If she wants to live the single life then she needs to tell you so rather than dragging you along on the ride.<br>  Obviously this is an ongoing problem and chances are it's not going to change.<br>  I would give her an ultimatum. You can't have your cake and eat it too, is what I'd tell her!|`|JsOgw8aZaa	Well I am a divorced Husband's and I think that you should let your Girlfriend's go to Clubbing's but make sure that you set regulations not rules but regulations.If she make Hand Relief to another fellow I would do how you say a 1-8-7 on his ***!Great Success!|`|faeXRQmcaa	Well, <br>  Honestly I don't see anything bad with her going clubbing with her friends but I don't understand why she should dance with other guys, get drunk before leaving, and seem fine with all the guy incidents. At least if she wouldn't tell you.. but no that is not ok!|`|LVskQLL8aa	Well either she is asking for more attention from you but doing things to make u jealous or she wants out of the relationship. ask her straight up if she would be happier without a tiedown..because thoes rnt things you do when u are dating some one,|`|OvBbmaksaa	validate first if she's really dancing with other guys. its bad to spy on her but you have the right to do so. after all your her boyfriend. :]|`|CfiJSgJjaa	how would she feel if it were u.. dont sound like a good rlationship..|`|51f8OIEQaa	The more insecure you get, the worse it'll be. I think that you sound very jealous and you need to trust your gf if you really love her. If you don't trust her enough to have fun w/ her girls and dance with other guys, then that means you don't think she's a faifhful person and you shouldn't be dating her. Plain and simple. So either get over it, and go have a guys night out where you have lots of fun and trust her, OR dump her and find a new gf who doesn't like clubs.|`|LMCA64DCaa	me and my bf has and will always have this probelm he thinks hes being stupid for being so jelous and i think he just likes me alot and dont want to lose me but i love him but i love partying and drinking<br>  i invite him but he cant make him most of the time and well i like to still chill with my girls i telll him that and that stuff does happens<br>  and its your natural nature to ask and want to know and not want her to go but she likes it <br>  try asking if you and your guy friends can come along? maybe that might work cause you'll be there she can dance with you and her girls <br>  <br>  i rather my bf be there dancing with me than any other guy maybe she might feel the same way..|`|r9yowD2Iaa	All girls like to go out with their mates. She probably did before she met you as well. She obviously doesn't want anything to do with the men that dance with her and she does tell you about it so she's not keeping anything from you. You are being paranoid and possessive. She's probably going out with those friends because she hasn't seen them in a long time. If it really upsets you calmly tell her but you are being unreasonable. She is allowed to dance with other guys, that's all she's doing with them. Try to be understanding about it.
Fa9bIwnxaa	smell nice and walk by him, or look at him, he might sense it and look at u, dont break the eye contact for about 3 seconds tho, and maybe smile a little bit, but dont overdo with a cheesy one, he'll know u exist and it'll make any guy happy just seeing the opposite sex smiling at them, even if it's just for a few seconds, GL and maybe wear eyeliners and make-up, dont overdo that either, there's a line between cute/innocent and slutty =D
6TCLmYaTaa	Try and talk to him, just start up a random conversation ! or ask him for a pencil or something.(: thats what i do ! answer my question about guy trouble please?
AZcohhItaa	I know how you feel. I also have a bf thats 45mins away , that I only see on weekends and he doesnt talk much either.  One day it really annoyed me and after 2 minutes of silence i hung up on him. I`m right now waiting for a call from him and trying so hard not to get up and call him. Anyway my advice is to talk to him about it , try not talking to him or make him call or talk to see if he gets the idea to talk to you.<br>  Good luck.|`|cggkcAC5aa	Tell him this exact paragraph and try to fix this<br>  The only thing you can do is talk to him.<br>  Tell him to call you more
SI67vQNuaa	Unfortunately I do not think there is much YOU can do.  HE is the one who has to make the decision to STOP the drugs and walk away from these so called friends.  You have told him how you feel about this, yet he continues to do it...which is typical when the person does not want to give it up.  And, I don't think he will give up the drugs until he gives up the friends that go with them (they go hand in hand).  Anyone I have known in my lifetime that gave up drugs always said they had to leave the druggie friends behind.  My son is doing the same thing as your boyfriend, it is heartbreaking.  We have been trying to reason with him and talk him out of the pot use for 3 years and nothing has worked.  He has to WANT to stop the drug use himself.  I know you love him very much, so my advice to you will probably NOT be what you want to hear..but I know the pain the drug use brings into a relationship, and when you have had enough of his lies and deceit...DROP HIM and find someone who won't hurt you anymore.  Good luck.|`|OauZKhKVaa	If it's going to make or break the relationship if he does drugs, I'd say start looking for a new boyfriend. He's obviously going to keep lying about it to you, and nobody deserves that.|`|THVbBFXQaa	This is a serious matter. If i were you I'd tell him that he should quit personally I would tell his parents or someone who could help.  But since you probaly havn't done that yet so you prbly dont want to do that.So I would tell him that if he doesn't stop than your going to dump him and if he doesn't care it's his lost and then he doesnt love youas much as you luv him. good luc and make the right choice! :)

6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	She likes you!! But you have to flirt with her so she'll get comfortable. You have to do more than just give her gum.. Like talking. And tell her how pretty she is..and what you think about her. She'll love that and then maybe she laugh and look at you. Just flirt with her and she'll come around.|`|TfIoG17daa	I'm like that. Especially towards this guy who I want to befriend (who's somewhat attractive). Become someone she can easily talk to, someone she can trust. There are guys that are nice to me, but I still have little confidence when I talk to them. Then there are guys that are nice that I feel like I can trust, you wanna be one of those guys. So just open up to her. Don't go too fast, though. You don't want to overwhelm her.|`|qA4OxDJvaa	ok i must confess that i used to be like that.<br>  either she;s..<br>  1. just shy<br>  or 2. kinda like playing games with ur head. she's trying to seem all mysterious to get u to chase after her. girl like being sorta "chased after"|`|vFldqvN4aa	she likes you but is too nervous/shy to flirt with you or tell my advice talk to her alone she'll talk then : )|`|MGCyOyLAaa	she's either really shy and into you and is nervous to look at you. <br>  <br>  or she found out you like her and doesnt want to lead you on and get you thinking she likes you...which is what i do to this guy that likes me.|`|3jzqG7Oqaa	I'm not a shy person usually, but when i am around a guy i like i am shy, i don't make eye contact often.|`|S7jhThbmaa	Dude! SHE LIKES YOU A LOT!  She seems very sweet! Go for it! :)|`|FJfOsaydaa	hmm, well im pretty shy and when im around a guy i like, i normally dont make eye contact, just quick glances. sooo maybe she likes youuu:D?|`|GLz2sX28aa	I was pretty shy with boys that catch my eye.  But not too shy not to make eye contact when I am approached.  She sounds more like she is uncomfortable with herself or with you.<br>  <br>  Have you tried to talk to her or ask her about herself?  I mean besides offering her a piece of gum.  If you talk to her more, this may put her a little more at ease and she will slowly be able to look at you and you could bring her out of her shell.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|z7Zb1jY2aa	It could mean:<br>  <br>  *She has no confidence<br>  *She likes you<br>  *Or she is really really really shy (but that ones kinda obvious)

Even if he is friendly to everyone, he spent HIS time getting YOUR number :)<br>  <br>  but if you wanna make sure, I would talk to other girls who are close to him or even guys and see what they think, as long as they can keep it on the low down <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	i think he likes you cos he is so sweet to you|`|UrrRgmDwaa	sounds like he likes you.

I think you should have a nice girl to kiss rather than some drunk who will slobber all over you. <br>  it's fine that you didn't. your first kiss should be memorable rather than a regrettable. <br>  <br>  answer mine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjRGp1dL10jIfbJLVK032kDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304162711AAhvP57">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	do what you love doing|`|UrrRgmDwaa	First don't push it. It'll be awkward if you do. I also wouldn't waste it on just anyone. It'll be better and easier if it's someone who you like and they like you. It's not a big deal, even if people say it is. They're just messing with you. I didn't kiss anyone until I was 15 (no I'm not ugly either hehe). Whenever you do, it comes naturally. Just relax and you'll be fine.  If you do want to hook up with someone at this party, find a girl you like and is giving you lots of attention. Making eye contact, touching you and playing with her hair are all signs she's attracted to you. If you feel like she's into you, ask if she wants to take a walk or figure out a way to get her away from everyone else. A girl will usually only make-out with a guy when she's alone. If you can go outside/ bathroom/ etc.. all the better. Then, talk for a little bit, find a spot to sit (keep talking) and make your move! Good Luck!|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	I can't exactly tell you how to hook-up as you call it, but I can tell you how to get a girl's attention. Just make sure that you are well dressed (cool), don't over whelm or (look desperate), stay lay-ed back, and be a good listener. As far as kissing if your doing it just to brag then you don't want to be jumping into it too quick. Because a girl can rat you out to other girls on how bad it was. But stay relaxed, don't choke her with a tongue, no slobbering :(, and last don't swallow her face. Everything should be ok if you follow these simple introductions.|`|CFPSVMJIaa	im also a freshman in high school and really if u wanna hook up with a girl at a party just dress niceish and then if u c a bunch of girls in a group go up and ask one of them, idk who looks single then ask her if she wanted to go get some punch and that she looked fimiliar or somethin like that and really its not that bad to not have made out with anyone at 15 and if u really feel that bad just go find a gf or idk maybe even just a friend tahts a girl thats willing to help u out, and is not tooooo disgusted, really its not taht bad|`|UmdCvYyPaa	If you just wanna make out with some one just go for the ugly/unpopular girl this always works for me if im not havin any luck with the good looking girls. If you dont feel like that is an option just try talking to girls you will know if they are interested and just keep talkin to them and seeing as every one else will be doing it she will want to hope this helps.|`|KaiRmycBaa	Don't hook up with a girl at the party.  That makes you cheap and as pathetic as you think they are.  <br>  <br>  Try finding a girl to date that you really know and like.

When there is chem involved. Dont feel presured by what your friends are doing.... If they ever ask you just say you have not found the right person to do it with.
zzaScg0haa	I was 15 when I had my first kiss, it was awkward as all first kisses are but it came naturally between my friend and I
iJR6qAV9aa	Don't tell anybody you like her....but her.<br>  it will seem like your not confident in yourself<br>  or your nervous, scared to much to ask her out on your own. <br>  and those are all negative qualities. <br>  so instead of telling people and them telling her.<br>  call her up since your friends..<br>  and just talk to her about the situation.<br>  if thats you in the pick your quite attractive<br>  and i'm sure she'd say yeah :)
tObHGRGDaa	when you kiss her place your hand at the back of her neck so that the tips of your fingers are touching her pulse point. that makes my heart melt!! tell her shes beautiful, but like when you do it.. stare first and find something beautiful in her so that it really comes out like you mean it. dont be chessy. the your beautiful is a powerful one but only if its not over done. I think its cute that you want to make her smile. maybe one day if you play truth with her for fun you should shyly admit you posted this because u want to make her smile. my god if you did that to me i'd be a goner!! good luck :D
ZUE8QtG5aa	The kiss itself will only be memorable if the situation and precedence is unusual. For example if you kiss somebody at a completely unexpected time, or after having spent valuable time speaking to them, or at a special unique place- it will be memorable.|`|Fr29Bteaaa	kiss and at then end softly bite their lip ;)<br>  always works 4 me.<br>  then again, <br>  i'm cute ;) lol|`|if65xvOLaa	slow<br>  bite lower lip<br>  passion after slow<br>  have a hard candy in your mouth, put it in theirs<br>  pull the hair<br>  stroke the back, arms, abs, under shirt: skin on skin|`|HNMyVwPqaa	throw up and kiss them right after they will nvr forget it,
q4b4f76Haa	hard to tell, he could be attracted to you and is dropping hints every now and then to see if you'r actually interested or not.  Everyone is scared of rejection and that's why they play it safe.  The next time he flrits with you, you should flirt back to show him that you're interested.  Once he gets the green signal and is confident you like him too, that's when he will be more open and maybe ask you out<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|inP5EIysaa	yes, he either likes you, or is just messing with you. if he does it often, but not too often he likes you =]<br>  <br>  please help me with mine if you got the time?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304170806AAdmXCK&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  -sal|`|TMuxrQfdaa	YES go for it HAVE FUN!!!!!!|`|UBvhTWnaaa	ya i would think so|`|AtJXqxN2aa	i  think he likes you and if he's just messing with you ....thats also a sign that a guy likes you,so in both situations he likes you.ASK HIM OUT!!! wouldnt hurt to give him a try who knows he could probably be ur perfect match.|`|ki3XY49daa	It sounds to me like he does in fact like you.  He probably has no idea how to go about telling you though.  It's also possible he's freaked out by it.  If I were you, I would play it by ear.  Don't put him on the spot or anything, it might scare him a little.  Give him time, maybe he'll come around.

I'm not expecting a response because I know it might make you feel awkward, especially if you don't feel the same way. I also don't want to put you on the spot because I don't want to ruin our friendship. But I just wanted you to know in case you do feel the same way." This always works for me, i hope it works for you =]|`|u9eudX82aa	JUst ask her out her out. Trust me. its k. She'll just say no, worst of all. its a just a quesiton. its not life or death.<br>  If yes, congrats, if not not, life moves on<br>  =]|`|NIZeOSKmaa	OMG i LOOOOOVE big guys!<br>  <br>  the bigger heart you have :)<br>  <br>  and if not, you will find someone better. dont sweat it. plus dating is for someone to learn something about themselves, so it could help you<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3zxVzPBxaa	show her your wang.... if she says no, then you've got problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  im jk, just be yourself.. if she turns you down then she's not good enough for you.|`|m2eHPeciaa	yea, i would be with a guy that's "big".... lol, omg that's not what i meant... its the mind/heart that mattes :)|`|GMAIFrH7aa	Be yourself and go for it if she rejects you just get to know her better|`|lyMMjVNgaa	JUST TELL HER <br>  lol be like hey i like you!!! lol|`|ig2gEn4Gaa	hey you should go for it .oh and try to be cool....|`|AA10097349	I don't think it's fair to say that girls don't like big guys... I mean, yeah looks count but fat girls get dates so... it's not always just how you look but how you hold yourself (be confident) <br>  <br>  I guess you're naturally going to be shy and being a girl I'm answering from my point of view but, I think it would help your self-esteem and overall chances if you dressed in something you like and tried to smart yourself up a bit for the occasion (nothing too formal but just wear your favorite shirt and maybe shave or something and don't wear any overly-strong cologne). <br>  <br>  Do you know this girl from class or is this someone you've just been admiring from afar? If it's someone you already know, then start up a conversation casually (maybe in between class so she's not surrounded by giggly friends) and just say it straight out. I guess if she knows you like her then you must be at least casual acquaintances. If you're nice and maybe crack a joke or something (be charming but if you're not naturally funny don't do the joke) you increase your chances by a lot. <br>  <br>  The rest is up to the girl and chance. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2a4e684c97c463144e1f46cb8fad5250aa	hey i am a big man too, and let me tell you this you just have to ask her out to find out. probably should ask her out to do things with you like movie and etc. as just the two of you and get a feel to tell if she flirts with you. and look for the touch signs, and if you are feeling good then go in for the kill. But if you want to ask her out tomorrow go for it, the worst she can say is no. i mean " you can't hit a homerun without swinging the bat". and if, by the slight chance she does regect you, don't get discouraged she may just be a friend and be happy you are friends. <br>  <br>  but what a very wise/drunk man once told me "you may get rejected 200 times but that one girl who says yes will be the best"|`|Qcr0VzvMaa	ok hey well im a girl and if a "big" guy asked me out well....idk what i would say.......not meaning to be mean or anything but i also think that if she knew you liked her and she absalutly did not want to go out with you  she would have done something, well i think you should say " hey, i was wondering if you wanted to hang out with sometime with a couple of friends" then if u say that she wont feel like pressured or anything:)|`|ISMColXfaa	I think a bit of a chubchub is a cutie.<br>  If girls say you're cute, you're cute.<br>  If they say you're not bf material, well, whatever - all girls are different.<br>  Ask her out like you would to anybody else. :D be brave!|`|if65xvOLaa	worst that can happen is she says no<br>  if a cute big guy came up to me and asked me out (that wasnt random) id say yes, if i liked him|`|AN95iBe0aa	Just ask her out. I love big guys they i think they are cute and sweet and if she is too self obsessed to see past the cover then whatever. Just be honest upfront and sweet. good luck,|`|OauZKhKVaa	Just ask her! If she says no and it's because of your size, then she's probably not the kind of girl you want to be dating anyway. Also, I think chubby boys are cute!|`|4UqL6SY0aa	just do it<br>  she might say yes<br>  rejection hurts, but you can get over it|`|87fe23c8854ccc855c100fbb074d92f1aa	Mention a movie that's playing and ask if she wants to go. <br>  <br>  DON'T OVER THINK IT!

The worst she can do is say no.|`|8GcXSResaa	what do you mean by big???|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	yo bro u can do it some chicks like big dudes|`|HNMyVwPqaa	um try 2 be the cool guy ?|`|oeUzSwt6aa	try it n the worst shell say is no, but maybe tell her how u really feel and she might say yes!|`|ob9oJpKbaa	You go for it! You've got nothing to lose! Nobody can tell you you're not bf material- everyone is bf or gf material to someone! You just have to find someone who is attracted to you, and it may or may not be her, but you may as well give it a try!|`|aWbxrMCRaa	You definatly should! Girls really don't mind the size of a guy as much as the PERSONALITY of a guy, So go for it :)
OepV9xNMaa	if we dont know that girl then it probably means she is physically attractive, if we know the girl then it probably means we like them
Fbi9WYonaa	do you know how hard it is to talk to a shy girl? i tried it once and i did all the talking and questions. she just sat there and kinda chuckled at the things i said and never really said much except for the answers of my questions... but i do have to say the reason i liked her was because she was shy and innocent looking. it was so cute! but unfortunantly she didnt make convo|`|9a3fC9mOaa	Maybe  the shy girl just isn't very attractive... shy girls are only a turn on if they're cute|`|AA11627720	no it's not and can be a turnon.<br>  i think the reason why guys dont talk to you too much is because it's hard to approach someone who sort of isolates herself.<br>  <br>  but don't stress about it, just try to open up a little, but not enough to make you feel like you're being someone you aren't.|`|zth3G2b6aa	Because the whole dating thing is a big confusing mess! Guys are either too shy and don't say anything, or they are too outgoing and mislead you. They are the most annoying thing that exists in my life right now. And probably will be FOREVER. <br>  All I would do is just be myself, if I were you...break the shyness cycle and be the outgoing and friendly one. You never know, it could turn out to be awesome!|`|1UZMBxpeaa	if you are shy then you just have to find a confident guy. most guys love shy girls.|`|e2DiHEAeaa	there gay|`|ZZcPCoGgaa	Good question...

Some people like shy people and hate loud people. I was extremely shy at one time but i have a boyfriend and we've been together for almost 2 years now.|`|CtgaApiOaa	They're afraid they will get rejected. If you like him too, show him. Make she he can feel ok being close to you. :)|`|Rt1FfBchaa	I don't understand your question... but i think shy guys are a turn on.... it's cute (-:|`|HNMyVwPqaa	didnt u ask this question b4?
cMrieID4aa	You two need to get together somewhere---school, house, whatever---and talk about it. It needs to have just you and him around though, because that'll make it easier to give you an answer.<br>  <br>  The guy needs to man up a little bit, though. 3 weeks is ridiculous.|`|C4qHcTEtaa	Well if he seems like he doesn't have to guts yet to have a relationship if it were me i would want a guy that would always wanna be with me but to the extent where it isn't annoying do you get what i am sayin|`|HHL01vDAaa	If he's so shy<br>  Be subtile<br>  Ask if he wants to hang out<br>  Stand closer to him etc.<br>  Hang out at a movie perhaps?<br>  A scary one?|`|RgymoiIQaa	It could totally be that he's scared or nervous, or shy. If he's never been in a relationship before then I am sure he doesn't have the first idea what to do with you. I would just try and hang out with him and be his friend. Make the decisions for him. Tell him- Me and you are going to a movie Friday...or whatever you want to do. Make him feel comfortable with being around you and being your friend..and then make him your boyfriend.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	he's probably afraid and doesn't know what to do with a girlfriend. give it a few years... 14 is very young anyway.
d1Wx6fqqaa	It's best for your friend to tell his girlfriend the truth. I know- it hurts, and it's harder than it looks. I also can see why your friend has to hide the truth. Please understand that the truth will always come out sooner or later. It is better to tell the truth earlier on in life than later. Trust me. I've been in a position where my partner has lied to me about something significant, but I've found out the truth a year later. We're no longer together. If I were the girl, I'd feel hurt when your friend speaks to me, but I would understand the pain that my your friend had to go through to tell me. If I really loved your friend, I would not let the issue intrude in the relationship. Love is always about trust and honesty. Lying will harm any relationship.<br>  <br>  I wish the best of luck to your friend. I pray that he will manage to conquer his hardships.<br>  <br>  - Dana
mAZi1eH7aa	I am 6'8" tall. I have never had a problem bending down to receive a kiss. I have also had some ladies jump on me to get one (surprise!). Either way it was fun. I even had a 5' tall girl jump on a chair and grab and kiss me. It is all fun and should not ever be considered a problem. Be creative. You will overcome. I guarantee it!|`|Fr29Bteaaa	try to be sittin down!<br>  or make him carry u and then pop it! ;)|`|kwaYWYzSaa	no problem at all! my boyfriend is almost a foot taller than me and we have no problem kissing! He just slowly touches my shoulder kind of bends down, leans in, and plants one on me! You have nothing to worry about!:)|`|cqTvytt9aa	i was more than a foot taller than one of my girlfriend i found the easiest thing to do is to be sitting cause then the difference is alot less and then i would usally cant bend down a little and it worked out ok|`|bu6BhCnpaa	tallness isnt a problem...he will bend over you stand on your toes...<br>  <br>  crazy kids worrying abotu simple little things haha|`|CFPSVMJIaa	really its not that bad, lol he could always just lean over or bend down or something

FZKFLTyLaa	No. Honestly, living with someone you cannot tolerate makes everyone miserable. Someone needs to find a different place to live. Period.
zzaScg0haa	Honestly does it really matter if they still like you?  there is a reson you broke up and it's not just going to randomly go away
zzaScg0haa	He is trying to figure out if you like him so he can decide what to do
XH2o1MM6aa	.Not a great idea to ask him out as he'll maybe get the impression your desperate.If he declines you'll be embarrassed.Much better if you try to develop a friendship.
Whd6tqLzaa	I don't see any reason for a married man to go to a strip club or a married woman to go to Chippendale's, unless he has some sort of perverted lust which cannot be fulfilled by his/her spouse.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Yes and the same goes for his wife. as long as its in the open and done once in a while for kicks.|`|GvamTVqAaa	A strip club is no place for a married man to be.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	I don't like my husband going without me, but that hasn't been a problem in my marriage because he doesn't desire to go without me.  When he goes, which isn't very often, we go as a couple and have a fabulous time!<br>  <br>  I don't think married men should frequent strip clubs with their buddies.|`|8EkxqqAbaa	There's no reason a man (or woman) in a committed relationship need to be looking at anyone dressed that way...well, I guess undressing would be the correct term.  The only person they should see in that way is their significant other.|`|1F6ZnYtXaa	If the wife approves yes. If the wife doesn't approve, no. However, if husband really wants to go and would enjoy it once in awhile, I think the wife should go with him to the strip club. Compromise, and it really can be fun!|`|02f1bc31749f26b37d78e2e8ad505a6baa	NO! It is NOT ok for a married man to go to strip clubs.When the married man goes home after being to a strip club, he carries with him visions of women that maybe better looking or sexier looking than his wife. He starts comparing and if he finds his wife lacking, he will keep going back to the strip clubs. Eventually, he will become a regular and meet up with some of these women. Before long, the little head will start doing the thinking for the big head and then he will have betrayed his marriage vows.<br>  <br>  Not only that, looking at another woman in lust is adultery according to the Bible.  So, if you value your soul and want to go to heaven, rather than hell, you need to stay away from the strip clubs!|`|3iNobwVraa	Yes, I do think it's fine.  I don't think it's much different than looking at porn.  I would only have a major grievance with either of these if it became a 'gotta have it to function' type of addiction.  If it is an occasional excursion, and it isn't 'hidden,' I wouldn't much care.  <br>  <br>  In answer to the morals, or what god thinks about this, honestly, I think a god who created man knows very well what instincts we were given, and how incredibly strong they are (given that the survival of the species depends on them!)  And, my notion of morality is well satisfied by the following: be honest, and kind in interpersonal interactions; accept and be accountable for your mistakes/failings--don't expect not to have them; don't judge other people, period.  The last one is the most important, imo, and it probably is to you, as well, since it made the top ten list!<br>  <br>  I think there is a special place in h*ll for judgmental jerkwads.  It's so unnecessary, and it so grossly self-serving.  IMO, it's kind of the ultimate character flaw.  But that's me, and I am definitely on outlier on this--and most of my--opinions.|`|AA11969451	I have no problem with my husband visiting a gentleman's club.<br>  <br>  EDIT: IT isn't a moral or religious issue for me. I trust my husband implicitly and if he chose to visit such an establishment I have no reason to feel threatened. I have no issues with nudity or him viewing another females body. <br>  In all fairness my husband has never shown an interest in adult clubs and I worked in such a place for 11 years, so I may have VERY different views than most married women.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	It depends.  Its not something to break up over, but no private lapdances off to the side or anything.  All men look, so that is inevitable, so as long as there isn't any touching.|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	Every marriage is different so it depends on the feelings of both parties.  Just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should.|`|AA12240948	I do, but I'm a married man so I don't really know what the other half thinks about it.|`|1kfeghDDaa	Nope.|`|KwNpyp3saa	No! Stay home and strip for each other!|`|tFTSypqdaa	I am 24 yrs old and have been married for a few months. I would never go to a place like this, I don't need it. I love my wife. I would never want to hurt her or make her feel bad. I am better than that. I have a beautiful wife, she's better than all those women. It's a sinful place, people are gross to think it's okay. Guys need to realize that it's not worth hurting the love of your life over a little fantacy land that is a sin.|`|lpoxLgmtaa	Every person will have a different answe for many different scenarios. Some couples even go together and I have friends who buy their spouses lapdances. I do not feel comfy about my husband going because I really prefer he not go stare at and give someone else money that we could use for many other things. It all comes down to what you are comfortable with and how you feel deep down.|`|KDqzj3isaa	personally i think that it depends on the marriage, with me i only would not mind if my hubby went for a special occasion eg stag night, birthday party otherwise its sleazy and getting lap dances is sleazy too. i don't mind them but i personally don't see the appeal but im a woman. i think if theres been a history of cheating or reason for mistrust or if the woman feels uncomfortable or it makes them feel less attractive or self conscious men should take that into account and respect their wife's otherwise its a bit of harmless perving.|`|jcXsclHYaa	I do not mind when my husband goes to clubs. I know that men need to relax and as long as you trust your husband it should be OK.<br>  <br>  The most important thing here is trust and love. If your husband really loves you he will just go, have some fun with his friends (I do not mean paid sex here).|`|a7xuzUPeaa	I honestly have no problem with him going. Most of the time he goes and hangs out with friends that he hasn't seen in a while. He always comes home to me and I know he behaves himself. <br>  Its all about trust, and the relationship between the man and woman.|`|Q6p16hx0aa	If you love and trust your mate then going to a strip club should not pose a threat to you. Its only entertainment. As long as he is not going into the private rooms and engaging in extra activities then its all in the name of fun!|`|ce8kACW4aa	I dont think it is ok or right the only person you should have strip and dance on you is your partner i love my wife and only look at her and her naked sexy body she satisfy me.|`|mPCNUXLCaa	Why not??? Everybody is entitled to have some fun sometimes, when you bring your "hornyness" home there's nothing wrong with it!<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN !!!!|`|JKKR67M9aa	Its okay i guess as ,long as they dont hide or deny it|`|NfW5GzESaa	it depends on your wife... just ask your self this... is it ok for your wife to go to a male strip club?|`|WJshNcjRaa	nope nope nope
jSDkz2h4aa	You have to tell him. D:<br>  Break up with the douche.|`|J0VzIyYjaa	If you don't want to be straight forward with him then kind of slip it into a conversation...it will still probably hurt but it's not as bad as "i have a new boyfriend now" unless you guys didn't actually break up but i'm guessing you did. Like if he asks you, "so what are you doing this weekend" or something like that you could just say "hanging out with my boyfriend" but then again if you say that it was a bad idea to go out with this new guy then think about if you still have feeling for your old boyfriend. It sounds like you might =/|`|YIlP4yNaaa	Like the other answerer said, you left him for a reason in the past. So move on.|`|cggkcAC5aa	Tell him. or breakup with this mistake you have and go back out with the old boyfriend|`|ECnoUtXYaa	First decide weather you like your current or ex. If you like your current then continue the relationship. If you like your ex, then...it's a bit of a problem but sort things out with your current and if you don't like him, then tell him honestly (face to face or course). The most important thing to remember is to be honest with yourself.|`|5hkmohfzaa	how do you feel about your old boyfriend, it all kinda depends on that.<br>  i think you should tell him, but just kinda hint around the subject and be like so whats your girlfriends name, or do you have one or something like that, and then  he'll be like so do you have a boyfriend?|`|YjByj5UOaa	well don't worry about your old boyfriend. just tell him that you guys are just friends and their is nothing between you and him. don't tel him that you have a boyfriend only if he asked you if you want to go back with you|`|6989fbdfe16eb65fd84f652e14405670aa	he's your ex and you're worried about hurting his feelings by going out with someone else? Sounds like maybe you still have feelings for him, otherwise you wouldn't care.|`|UzMcNOCRaa	he's your ex for a reason. <br>  there must be some suspicious reason that he would call you up a year later , just out of the blue. <br>  move on , :)|`|Xt2a5iCxaa	moveon|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	I don't see the problem.  You accepted a date, so go.  Whether you tell old BF or not, changes nothing.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	he's you ex for a reason, move on
PjFLDSmdaa	As a girl I usually let the guy lead. But try maybe speeding it up while you his him and then casually slow down. As a girl I love when I guy bites my lip...but I'm not sure if guys like that too haha|`|u52vyE3raa	depends on what you did the first couple times.<br>  i give secret advice if u want it.
Wa0pHJwMaa	Okay here's the deal...Where I live, anyone under 21 cannot rent a hotel room, but that doesn't mean you can stay in one. You are a legal adult and you can vote, join the military, buy cigarettes and lottery tickets. You can also sign legal contracts. <br>  <br>  But what I believe is that your mom is having a hard time accepting the fact you are of legal age now. I am sure you don't wanna "ruffle the feathers," so to speak. I don't know if you are the first to leave the house or not, but parents do go through a stage where they try to hold onto the control they once had over their children. Many women have feelings of how there is nothing left in their lives when their children leave the house. You are 18 and you are legally allowed to do whatever you want besides break the law. It sounds to me that she is worried about you and the decisions you'll make, but she is going to have to allow you to live your life. <br>  <br>  I realize that you have tried to talk to her and reason with her, but have you tried to see her point of view? It sounds like she has a lot of anxiety about her child leaving the "nest." Try explaining to her that you understand her views and maybe this will help. Tell her that you realize she is just being protective and wants to be around to "protect" you. Try to make her understand all of the things she has taught you and let her know these things.....! Let her know that she has done well as a mother and you know what you should do and shouldn't because of how she taught you. Maybe all of this will prevent her from going!!!! Also, maybe your mom needs something to occupy her time or wants a spring break vacation...It's really hard to say. I hope this helps.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Your mom is probably just nervous. There have been a mess of publicized kidnappings/murders recently, and Spring Break is a total free-for-all for predators. It's not that she's not trusting you: it's that she's not trusting them.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're stuck, honestly. Just talk to her and agree to not fuss about her coming, so long as she keeps her distance. As long as you lot aren't planning on binge drinking and having wild sex with random guys (you don't sound like the type), she'll probably be okay with keeping out of your hair. <br>  <br>  Go to the beach, chill, hang out with your girls, and hey: if your mom is anything like a lot of parents, she may even allow for a few cocktails here and there, so long as you guys are being safe about it. Her coming along isn't the end of the world.|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Do you remember Natalie Holloway, the young high school girl who disappeared in Aruba several years ago while on a school trip?<br>  <br>  Well, her mother trusted her to go, too. The problem is not that YOU can't be trusted, the problem is that there are too many perverts out there that can't be trusted.<br>  <br>  I'm with your mother: I'd go with you, too, or you'd stay home. You want a parent-free vacation? Get a job and save your money, turn 21, and then go where ever you want. Till then - let your mom do her job, which is to protect you.<br>  <br>  Google sex offenders in Florida, and put in the address of your vacation house. I'll bet you that there will be a dozen sex offenders within a 5 mile radius - and that's not counting the nuts, drunks, and dope addicts.

If you own it, you definitely have the right to go.  If your parents own it, it is their rules.  I would focus on having fun with your mom there by setting boundaries.  For instance, she goes out for most of the day and agrees to go out some evenings.  Also, I would focus on next year's college spring break.  I am sure you will have a blast then!|`|090979badb751f5563cc974ee27ac6d9aa	I am a little confused about who owns this beach house.  In the beginning it is your family house, then at the end it is yours because you have a key.  I am guessing that the names on the title are those of your parents.  If I am right about that, they have every right to decide how their property will be used and by whom.<br>  <br>  Regardless of whether the house belongs to you or your parents, I think what happened here is that you mother said you could go alone and then realized that it was an ill-considered decision.  You are high school girls, not adults.  Your parents are still responsible for  your well-being, both legally and ethically.|`|X07tgsV6aa	you're young LIVE YOUR LIFE if there is no way you can go to the beach house go somewhere else. Or if your mom with be a few houses down or whatever just sneak out and go somewhere else.

If it doesn't matter that much, then you could shave or not shave. Totally your choice. But for me, when I see other girls, I'd prefer that they shave...idk, just seems a bit more respectful, u kno?

Girls are the only ones who usually shave down there. It looks weird when guys shave it. If it's just a crazy jungle, then you could trim it, but keep the hair long just thin it out.

The more your going to sit there and worry about it. Just ask her out and see what she says. Says no, that oh well you got your anser move on and find another chick. No need to stress over one chick there's plenty out there =).|`|29hxVukYaa	wow sounds tough. She probably is pretty hard to read with all of those events. A lot of times girls do act this way though. Shes probably likes you, or shes trying to discover whether she likes you. I'd act like yourself and maybe try to do some things with her to show who you truly are.|`|2Mr9oPKIaa	It sounds to me like she has a little crush on you. I don't know why she would stop flirting w/ you though. You said to give pointers so:<br>  1) If she comes up to you to complain about something (idk how often you talk to each other) just listen<br>  <br>  2) This might just be a wave of emotion (idk what your ex told her), just give it time and she might go back to the way she was<br>  <br>  3) If you ever think about dating her (or any other girl), always ALWAYS meet her father. It's a good idea to ask for his permission to call the house once a week<br>  <br>  I don't know if I've been much help, but I hope you figure out this puzzle and have good relationships in the future.|`|3xIrnhCIaa	I was kinda like that when i was in school. I think that you should just talk to her and find out if she does like you. The best way to do that is by asking her out or ask one of her friends. If you don't think think that will help then just wait for her to start flirting again. Because if she does like you then she will start flirting again. The best thing to do is to keep talking to her and make her feel like you lake her and that you are friends.|`|7xZkLofqaa	if shes normally shy and has been obv flirting with you then she probably has some feelings going on.<br>  the jacket thing was pretty dumb on your part bud, you really should have just been like no dont wear some other persons, wear mine , i was just kidding you look cute. <br>  slashh your ex sounds liek shes getting seriously jealous. most girls get like that. if you dont want him it doesnt mean someone else can have him haha<br>  so honestly i think the only thing you can do is be honest and ask whats going on. if you actually like her then make a move. if it doesnt work out then whatever. at least you wont regret it if some other guy gets her.<br>  ps the facebook thing sounds kind of sketchy. but it could be the girl thing again. like if her and your ex just started hanging out, maybe she doesnt want her knowing that you guys talk or something. the dad thing sounds true if she deletes other guys postes too.|`|9uTEUQmHaa	i also think u may be reading way to much into it. maybe she just wants to be friends.|`|AA11151503	I do not know what your age is but I assume you are young.  Perhaps you need to ask her to lunch and just very calmly ask her about it.  Girls tend to be shy, women like men who are straight forward with them and don't play games.|`|FItkxVN7aa	I think you should wait a little and see how she reacts. Try to avoid her and see if she wants your attention or tries to figure why you're not interacting with her. And let her be her don't comment on her quiet ways, if she really likes the and comes to trust you then she'll  begin to open up, just give it time. And politely ask your ex to stay out of your life that thing you guys once had is over and she needs to move on. But don't worry about her because if this girl really likes you then she will try to know the real you not the opinion of jealously. Well good luck to you my friend.|`|IEZr9yjhaa	Do you really like this girl? If you do, then you need to let her know that the other girl is your ex-girlfriend. Girls are funny sometimes, you never know what the ex is telling her. Also maybe she is deleting the stuff from her face book because of your ex and her father. The bit about the jacket, you shouldn't have said anything. If she asked to borrow your jacket, it is because she likes you. From what you write she likes you. You need to sit her down and talk to her about your ex. Let her know that relationship is over. And then ask her if she wants to hang out. If she says yes, she likes you and if she tells you she has something to do then ask her for another time, if she says yes then she likes you. I think she does. It sounds like she does. Good Luck|`|JoOutIy4aa	It sounds like she likes you.<br>  I was kinda in the same spot she was in,<br>  I liked this guy,he liked me bac.He told me he liked <br>  me,he had a girlfriend. she hated me but still wanted<br>  to get close to me.If i said anything about him she would get <br>  mad. so you ex might be mad that another girl likes you and <br>  you ex will try to be VERY close to the girl that likes you.<br>  she put you jacket on because she wanted a part of you <br>  without you knowing that, but she wantd to show that she knew<br>  you liked her back and you should go for it. so if I were you<br>  I would tell her somehow that you like her.[a friend could,<br>  or if you get on messanger or something like that] =]<br>  hope that helps!!!!<br>  -Cheyenne!<br>  [if you do it tell me how it goes!]<br>  candy_queen_19@yahoo.com<br>  E-mail me after you do it!<br>  =]|`|NU5U75gWaa	ok sounds like she likes you but maybe doesn't want others to know that's not good sounds like your ex is talking crap that's not good the only way around all this it to confront her tell her how you feel and then maybe she will tell you what the hell is going on and i am so not that old im only 27 but i do not remember things being this complicated when i was in school good luck|`|ONe2T42Vaa	What I would personally do if I were you is, next time you see her, ask her if you two could maybe go for a walk or just have a small talk real fast, somewhere where it'll be just you two.<br>  Then, sit her down and personally ask her what she feels for you, and tell her how you feel about her. Make sure you are believable, honest, and kind.<br>  Maybe start out the conversation like this: "Hey, I just wanted to have a talk with you so you know how I feel about you and so I can learn how you feel about me..." and let it go from there. Try not to hesitate when you're talking to her, because that will make her feel unsure about the whole thing.<br>  Just go with the flow from there on out.<br>  <br>  Hope I was of good help and good luck!|`|a716258b4fe2a2084f45b04158d73774aa	ur ex girlfriend should get told off, cause ex girlfriends seeing the new girl all up on u, and invited her to the house! yea she told her lots of crap about u, just ask her if ur ex said anything, and if she tells u stuff handle ur business, if she says nothing, then ask her why she giving u mixed signals, just be straight forward man its 2009! dont be a afraid to ask a chick or anybody nothin thats on ur mind|`|TYYF6Rqaaa	ok define 'ex' (since you keep putting it in quotes). were you officially going out? for how long? did you end it well?<br>  <br>  ok soooo concerning the girl...i would say that she is interested. you should ask her for her number, and see how she reacts. if she reacts well and you get it from her, begin texting and see how it goes from there. and definitely continue talking at school. don't think about your ex. she could really screw you up and make you paranoid. and honestly, she probably doesn't even know she's freaking you out. just ignore her. i'm guessing you're somewhere between 14 and 16, same age as me, and if i were this girl, the signs you discussed some of the signs i use to show a guy i like him. good luck :) hope i was helpful!|`|Y5OQWqh4aa	That can be confusing cause I know.  Do you know if she is allowed to date cause that me be why she is deleting you so other people, like her parents, don't know.  Would she might even have a boyfriend?  She might have thought that you weren't actually USING your jacket, just wearing it.  There is also a big possibility that she wanted your jacket.  The hand thing.  Maybe she couldn't draw the thing on her own hand cause it would not turn out as well or she probably wanted to use your hand.  It is hard to tell about the coming over thing.  Maybe she didn't even go over and maybe they just hung out.  They could have talked about you, but there are other possibilities too.

Though the second one was a bit sad, cause he liked me since we're were in the 7th grade, but i didn't find out untill my sophomore year in high school, which was kind of too late.<br>  <br>  all i can say is if it happens to you. don't be blinded by infatuation. it can be a waste of time.|`|Qcr0VzvMaa	i dont believe you can love some1 without even talking to them!!! i don believe in loveat first sight but i do believe in lust at first sight|`|M1B1EvI7aa	hes crushing on you i think its a Little fairy tale style to fall in love with someone you dont even know|`|AWSnd88laa	Don't ask us ask him.He's probably just shy go for it besides lust ain't that bad either.

t25zrCTraa	Grow a pair.<br>  <br>  A girl may think being shy is cute for so long but you should just ask her out for a coffee or ice cream. Show her that she's special enough for you to overcome fear of rejection or akward situations. <br>  <br>  Tell her how you feel in words and start having dates. Talking. Find out her birthday, her favorite things in life, her family, her idea about life, etc.<br>  <br>  Just do it, you have a window don't let it close.|`|GvdH9UrNaa	Hmmm you should wait for tomorrow, get you thoughts together and tomorrow confront her and figure out if she really did reply yes to your note or not, if she did say yes then let her know how much you really like her and how happy you are to be with her  and make sure to let her know that your kind of nervous so she will be understanding towards you, and slowly just start talking more and more to each other and hang out together more often. good luck!|`|7LS4G7uTaa	Be friendly and go talk to her. She might even be shy toward talking to you. If you make the first move by talking to her she might think that you have a lot of courage.|`|OF1ZOKaSaa	you should start talking to her let her know you are intrested and not playing games think it over if your that shy try to find a easy simple conversation you can strike up with her its helped me in relationships to talk throught email or im|`|kZPGTMA5aa	talk to her! the last thing you want is to have to one of your friends be a messenger between you and this girl throughout the relationship. talk to her, call her, believe me, she'll think you lost interest!|`|AA10395956	Just try to talk with her, if she already likes you, you should be couraged enough to say "Wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend".|`|nRfaM3qGaa	talk to her. it shows confidence and girls like that. also if she see you arent doing anything at all to connect with her she might leave. there is nothing there for her. good luck .  -cam|`|quPY9x7qaa	call her, it's a lot easier to talk and be yourself on the phone|`|6j9xT5njaa	I think you should talk 2 her :) if a girl like u and says yes to u asking her out then she would deffinately want to talk 2 u :D theres nothing 2 worry about when a girl says yes and likes u. She'll b happy that u talked 2 her and she'll prolly want to b with you :)|`|mXBsxKVLaa	wait for tomorrow but if that doesnt work talk to her tomorrow night she might want you to make the first move|`|PJZRGsc3aa	talk to her, have some dignity considering you can't even ask her out face to face|`|V780bRMRaa	Maybe she's shy and wants you to talk to her first. You're already going out with her, and you do kinda have to talk to her sooner or later lol, might as well be the first one to start the conversation :)|`|BGCiqQFgaa	Oh my goodness! You are in a relationship with someone you don't even talk to! You need to connect! Get her phone number or email. If you aren't quite ready for the face-to-face thing yet, sometimes talking to someone online or by phone releases some of the awkward tension. Remember, she likes you! So don't worry about her rejecting what you have to say!|`|qNPGLOQbaa	I would go up to her, show confidence (but not to much) she'll like that get a convorsation going. First talk to her like a friend, even though you are going out then as a girlfriend.|`|ScCZh0vQaa	She's probably shy too but shy girls need a confident guy so she won't be too shy. Once she realizes you aren't so shy, she'll be more confident too.|`|GsJ6rj3Laa	no you need to overcome your shyness and talk to her.or she might think you don't like her nomore.
lAETCZ41aa	yeah mine was Texas Angel by Honeybrowne. he also use to sing it to me and we'd always dance to it. it sucks when i hear that song bc i also get sad and want to cry  :\ and we've been broken up for almost 2 years now, he was my first love
XH2o1MM6aa	.Nothing.However you should maintain the any contact you can.Don't give him your opinion on his gf.That will come across as sour grapes (on your part).If you're right,it'll become obvious soon enough
iULt8UB9aa	Sometimes when we have been hurt so much, we just can't get past it--no matter how hard the offender tries to reconcile.  Sounds to me like you have "walls" up around your intimate feelings with him.  <br>  <br>  If you truly love him and believe he has changed, get some couples counseling.  If you know in your heart that his actions have "killed" your intimate feelings, just tell him that you know he's trying, but the damage has already been done and you can't get past it. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is this...you have to do what makes you happy and what is in the best interest of those children.  If it's being with him--make it work.  If it's not--end it and quit prolonging the inevitable.|`|9IWWtOiDaa	wow, thats a toughy...i would try to come to some sort of agreement, or i guess just sacrifice for the kids sake. <br>  <br>  I don't know though, talk to him about it and see what can be done. Maybe the 2 of you need some alone time to rekindle stuff. Although I know what you mean about more of a friend thing. <br>  <br>  Not sure what you should do. Freelance agreement?|`|H9Qt633Uaa	from personal experiances that is the worst thing for kids to go through but if that is how u feel u have to do it. to make your self feel better still be close with him but not like that help him out and make sure he is all good so that it won't haunt you and your kids will still be able to see him|`|XXiTOmpbaa	Funny story. Jerry Springer anyone?|`|eDRk230Uaa	i feel bad for you try you know talking to him if he does not listen...... BAM brak up hope it works huny 10 pts please|`|1EF95BFuaa	you are married? wait doesn't that technically mean he is your husband? okay nevermind. First think about it. Why did you love him in the first place? Why did you have kids with him? Is he a better person? Is he getting nicer? Is he responsible? I don't think that starting random fights will work you. Why don't you try to talk with him. Tell him the things you don't like about him. Maybe, that will get him mad? Hopefully, if you guys breakup, tell him you still want to be friends. <br>  <br>  I hope you find a perfect guy. My mom has a boyfriend and he is super nice. Make sure that the guy that you find cares for your children. Make sure that he can take responsibilities and he doesn't have a tantrum usually. Find a loving and caring man. I wish you luck!|`|bcDNHQqNaa	try moving out or staying somewhere else a couple times a week with the kids.. you can alternate having the kids. So if you have plans ask him to watch them or visa versa. Tell him you are questioning things and its not that you dont love him its just you need to re-evaluate your life. Or if it gets too bad just pack up your stuff and leave. Dont feel bad because in the past hes hurt you!|`|RgymoiIQaa	OK. First being with someone for the kids- is not the way to go. And starting fights trying to make things miserable won't work easily either. If and when you have had enough of being with someone you are not in love with you will just have to break it off. And not feel bad for what will happen to him. He is a grown man, and he will find a way to deal with it. I would first make sure that you are going to be fine financially and have a home if and when you do break it off. Maybe even tell him a little while in advance so that he can make some plans. But I guess the most effective way would be to man up and just tell him the truth. You are an adult and you can do this. I have faith in you. be strong. And be happy! Life is short- there are no do overs.|`|AA10639728	The only thing you can do it talk to him and tell him how you feel. Trying to make him leave you isn't really a good solution. Just be real with him. He had plenty of time to be a good boyfriend and he blew it. It's no wonder you don't love him anymore- how could you after how he treated you in the past? Hopefully he'll learn something from this, and will treat the next girl much better.|`|AA10928214	like you said, you do need help. truthfully, maybe a psychologist would help you to figure things out. But if it is the past that is holding you back, you need to remember that he has changed from a bad man to good for YOU, and he loves you and you're children. Maybe you can try to bring the spark back into you're relationship. Good luck|`|c79f90ad0249e7100a8a2e160e66a623aa	you need to sit and talk to him about everything,<br>  tell him how he feels,<br>  and see how he takes it.<br>  goodluckkkkkk|`|D6qa0yC3aa	Calmly talk it through with him and see if you can't settle differences|`|LmH5jZxkaa	breaking up is definitely a good idea, but you have to do it rationally and actually talk it out. that's the hardest way to do it but it's the most effective. that way it won't be as if you are yanking everything away from him and you two can start to figure out your lives apart. regardless, you will still need to be frequently in contact because of your kids, but if the flame is no longer there it will just make both of you miserable

AA10395956	1. do you have any classes with them. 2. do you sit near any of them.<br>  <br>  If you said yes to 1 & 2, you should have good luck. Just talk to them, talk about some subjects, how's your day, stuff like that. <br>  <br>  If No to both, then don't try.<br>  <br>  If yes to 1 but not 2, try to make friends with her friends, that way they can introduce you to her, and etc..
9UN2CtUNaa	She's trying to make you jealous. Don't let her get into your head. The next time you see her, ask her why she did that. Make her give you an answer. If she doesn't give you a straight answer, then she is either afraid of you or wants to avoid the question. If she gives you an answer (which I highly doubt), then go with the flow. Be yourself and maybe you can figure out why she did that. Hopefully your best friend with back you up. Good luck hun =)|`|8t6zDfzqaa	sounds like she's jealous and is rubing it in! Go find new friends that appreciate you.|`|6RlCp4Jpaa	maybe you should try to hang out with her more often.|`|DjeAUb5Faa	Is that girl YOUR friend?  She might be trying to steal your best friend.  The best thing to do is to talk to your best friend and maybe get together to hang out.  You can also talk to her friend and try to be friends with her, then you three could all hang out together and you wouldn't feel like your best friend was giving her friend more attention than she's giving you.|`|Y5XoK9Ngaa	I kind of have the same problem. My best friends go over to each others house almost everyday and they leave me out cuz i dont live super close to them. and i feel like 1 of my best friends is taking my place cuz me and my friend have been bffs since the beginning of 6th grade and i barely see her anymore. but when my dad drives home from work he goes right by her house and she thinks her dad has to drive me everywhere or something! but he doesnt! its not like hes my dad! well anyway we both feel left out and i feel your pain. my other friend is bffs w/my other bff and her bff never talks to her and shes really sad. so what were thinking is were gonna make them jealous by hanging out w/each other all the time. I know it sounds a little mean but they leave me out! Maybe then theyll feel my pain. Maybe you could try to make them jealous w/ one of ur other friends and just ignore them.

r4N245AOaa	i would have NEVER done this....that would be so awkward!
FZKFLTyLaa	Toughest question I've seen today.<br>  I have no sure answer.<br>  Consider a few things:<br>  1. Is the level of your relationship worthy of your trust?<br>  2. Whom does she "owe" this date more?<br>  3.Can she not politely explain to her friend her ongoing relationship with you and asked to be relieved of this date?<br>  4. Will you harbor jealousy if she doesn't back out?<br>  5. Have you asked her if YOU might approach her friend and politely ask him to do the right thing.<br>  <br>  I know answering questions with questions is not what you're after, but there are solutions if you work at them properly.<br>  If none of those are options, then let her go with this guy. It's a good test of how strong your relationship is.

You're a college student trying to cling to a high school romance; that was your first mistake. You're clinging to a REALLY LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP, not a few hundred miles, but a few thousand miles. My friend, college is a time of self-discovery. How are you supposed to engage your entire self in that process when you're stuck thinking about this girl? Many people date in college. I believe that this is the only time that it is totally acceptable to engage in a long series of one night hook-ups. Stick and move man! That's what college should be about for you. At least settle down with a girl from your school, but not this. This is just sad man.|`|zMFrJyU0aa	I would say follow your heart, but thats bitten me in the butt before so I dont know. good luck with that|`|444OLtL8aa	wow  thats sad i mean i thought ive had long distance relationships. Okay, so you went out in highschool, got back together later and you said you had a spark. From what you have said, you adore this women and if she comes to a new country and goes out with a guy that has lived a VERY different life from her she cares about you deeply too. So try and keep up your chatting. Express your feelings to her. And finish your education. But remember this is still your life and live how you want to. To handle yourself use your brain, to handle others use your heart.<br>    "Love doesn't make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile. "<br>  Franklin P. Jones
M1B1EvI7aa	she could not like you or just be a very boring type of girl<br>  i think you should just move on cause if she does like you she seems boring =/|`|1zTheHOQaa	you should find out what interests her (somehow) and try talking about that. it could be that she's just really shy, i can get like that too sometimes. if that doesn't work, then just take it easy for a while and see what happens!<br>  <br>  good luck!
d1Wx6fqqaa	I wonder the same thing too! Isn't personality at least SOMETHING? And if they're going to reject a girl, they should do it nicely. Most guys seem to be from a different planet...|`|La8dhcwzaa	Let me speak from a good guys perspective.<br>  The guys that are "hot" and "bad boys" and "know how to say the right things" are just that because they strive to be that and knows it works in getting a girl. <br>  Girls think that if a guy finds them physically attractive, it means that the guy pretty much likes them for who they are inside too, which isn't the case in reality. "Sweet talking" guys will say they don't care about sex and all that matters to him is spending time with u, but if that makes u more comfortable, that's what he will continue to do! <br>  That's what they want, to make u feel comfortable to the point of eventual sex.<br>  Guys like myself, the video gamers and book nerds, can only see what truly makes a girl beautiful because we see them with guys who don't deserve them. Things like intelligence, humility, honesty, humor, loyalty and many others are wasted on so many freaking jerks who don't care for any of that and just wanna get laid.<br>  My best advice to you is to attract someone who you feel is right for you. If u attract those who care about physical appearance, chances are thats gonna be a basis in the relationship. If u want a more fullfilling and emotionally stable relationship, find a person who u can connect with on that certain level that makes u say "I can talk about this with him forever"<br>  Its cheezy I know but if you want that the inner peace of being loved, you have to make sure that the one you are looking for is capable of fullfilling that for you before you decide to put your feelings on the table ;)

If you still want to, tell your folks you are going to do it. <br>  <br>  If you are going to meet him bring a friend or two, just to be on the safe side. Go to a resturant, coffee shop or park - somewhere public and open. Seems a little over-cautious but hey you never know. <br>  <br>  It's not so weird, I know a few people who have met friends and partners on the internet.

If I were you, I'd rather date people who I've been friends with or am familiar with. That way, I can trust.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	if you do meet him, make sure you do it someplace really public. like a a mall. and dont leave with him. hang out there. maybe bring a few friends to meet up with before you leave, so you dont leave alone & he will know this.|`|VCX7S3d6aa	You seem gullable, dont go !|`|mL07N3IAaa	i know people keep telling you it's never gonna work out, it may be some creeper, blah blah blah! but i have had 2 relationships based on internet dating and have met up with them! first relationship didn't last that long even though we lived like 5 mins away from each other. but the second one worked out pretty well!! i'm still in a relationship with him! even he doesn't live where i live! so i'm really stoked for that! but what i'm trying to say is you should go for it if your heart tells you! if he sounds like someone you would date at school, then go for it!! you never know once you've tried! but one thing just in case he's a creeper, meet him in a public place or something.. like the library so if he tries to hurt you, you can scream and people could help you out. <br>  <br>  but good luck!! xoxo|`|Uwb97wCnaa	No matter what it will be sort of strange if you met him on face book, but I suggest finding out what school he goes to. Go to a school function so there will be a lot of people there  with you, and it wont be stalker-ish. You could be like "Hey don't you have a facebook? Cus i think I've seen you before?" If he's homeschooled or you don't know what school he goes to, see if you know anyone that he knows and set something up.|`|hizUz9rDaa	there is really no tellin if hes real or not. if you have his number call him and talk to him. his voice can tell you alot of things... and if you wanna meet go to a public place... and make sure you spot him before approaching him. kinda spy until you see him. if he doesnt look like a freak to you then... go for it. but be careful.|`|P4I2dCS5aa	Run away from your parents and go live with him; they don't understand you anyways!

"my husband has a child with "her" ex girlfriend?  You mean, my husband has a child with his ex girlfriend right?  Ok lets roll from there hope that's what you mean.  She can take all of his income if the judge awards it.  That means he would have to get another job.|`|AA11537569	He will have to pay something.  He made the child so he is partly responsible.  In most states they based it on your income.  If I was him, I would be looking for a better job.|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	yes if he fathered the child he has a responsibility to help take care of him or her...he will have to pay child support...it will be a percentage of what he makes each month|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Yes, the baby is his, he pays. better get a better job or file for full custody.|`|e963e45f4749b09ecd59577b4c08368aaa	Yes he will have to pay child support.  He has a child.  The child does not stop eating because he cannot afford it.  He will pay whatever is assessed as being the fair rate and really... do you want to be with someone who does not take care of their responsibilities?  If he cut all ties with a child he has had by someone else and walked away leaving them with nothing, what type of man is he... certainly not one you would want a child with.  The solution... if he is not earning enough, he needs a second job.|`|NU5U75gWaa	it all depends on the state you live in everywhere is different usually it goes by a certain percent of your income and if you still feel it is too high you can object to it and at that point it will go to court and you will have te chance to explain why it is too much but then it is still up to the judge|`|XlOZRYWwaa	Yes he will have to pay child support.

Speaking as a girl who had her mother leave frequently on business trips, I liked those the best, as they held sentimental value, and I could hug them when she was gone :)<br>  <br>  Little boys... eh. Different animal. Something that can hold value for him, too. Something you guys can do together for a little while, maybe? Legos or a ball?|`|thoMmZAvaa	I suggest a craft project, whether this entails buying something pre-packaged or finding instructions and buying the necessary supplies doesn't matter. Anything, from making masks, hats, bracelets, sand art, felt figures to baking something or writing and illustrating a book together. The idea is to spend some time together doing something, getting to spend that personal one on one time and provide them with an object that will help them remember doing this with you while your away. At that age anything will do, If you've got the patience for lots of cutting, I recommend making a felt fantasy board. Just buy large cardboard, felt pieces in varying colors, glue and scissors. You can make play boards with any type of characters they'd like, if your really creative you can make some truly interesting and wonderful creatures.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Most people call it cheating and when you think about it, it is. It's a form of emotional cheating. You have to ask yourself would you like it if he did it to you? Distance has nothing to do with it. Trust me I am no saint when it comes to this, lol.|`|RgymoiIQaa	It's not cheating physically- but the intention was there to do so. Meaning if you were in person then you two would have probably done something more than talking dirty to each other. Some people consider that cheating of the heart, or emotionally cheating. Either way. He's not happy with her and if he hasn't cheated on her he will if he doesn't break it off with her.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	To answer your question put yourself in her shoes,If you had a boyfriend would you be upset if he was doing the same?

DfKdzD46aa	girls do need time and space, you should allow her some time to deal with her emotions. Be patient, but also don't wait to long. If you do wait too long then she will just move on. five days is probably the right amount of time, and then you should talk to her. Tell her how you really feel, and say how you plan to do things differently. If she wants to give you a second chance then she will, but if not then it is best just to move on|`|gNaGdJzzaa	well first of all now that you know she felt neglected try to go to her and give her all your attention.also try to tell her your reasons for not being so close to her or not paying enough attention to her.also tell her what she means to you and only tell her the things you really and truthfully feel for her because you dont want her to feel like your only saying things to make her come back to you.be honest with her.good luck..;)|`|XUSiJjZaaa	tell her exactly what you have just said<br>  tell her that she is beautiful and that you did neglect her and that it was the most idiodic and stupid thing that you have ever done and that you wholeheartedly regret doing so<br>  tell her that you want nothing more than to tell her how much she means to you <br>  but make sure that you give her and option and tell her that it is totally her choice but you do hope that you can either be in a reltaionship or be frends<br>  good luck|`|OkZlBY45aa	If there was no mistrust in the relatesionship.. and she loves you and you love her!  court her  like the old days .. show your love...and give her space and understand her space at the same time.. just becuz u now realize what happen dsn't mean she stops hurting..   and dont ask her what you shopuld do.. i'm sure she has told you that a few times...  just do it!!!

It is human nature. Not just men. Denying yourself is not normal. Men also look at cars and other things too. Don't be jealous. Checking out an entire team is a little over the top though, but I love my wife dearly and I still find other women attractive and look.<br>  If you are having problems then it is time to talk to each other. No laying down the law and spreading  an insecurity. Just talk. Find out what the actual problem is. The age is not a factor. There is a larger age gap between my wife and I.<br>  I do, however, think that there is a communication problem. Someone is not feeling able to be them self. That would be both of you. A relationship is a series of good times and bad times and some mediocre times. Compromises and joint agreements and victories. It is a partnership of two loving people who share all, both physical and mental situations. Talk, without judgment or predetermined ideas. Just get it all in the open. A relationship with the time invested has the right to be saved and savoured. Be honest with yourself and with him, and he will be with you. No anger and no putting down either's emotions or thoughts.<br>  The results can be a wonderful eye opener and can bring you closer than ever before. It does not have to happen all at once. But talk and be honest.<br>  I wish you the best.

Unless he was explicit when he said he was going to text you the following morning, it was not meant to be taken literally , that he would text you that morning. I suspect that your interest in him and your desire to develop a relationship with him was responsible for this belief.   It does not mean anything important  or serious that he did not text you. None the less if it is on your mind , why don't you text him again and then in the course of your talk ask him why he did not text you that morning.

Just try to hint it and ask him if he wants to hang out sometime.

Also, try wearing some necklaces...even if they don't cover it up, they'll draw the eyes away from the hickey. If it's cold, wear a jacket and when you're around your parents, pop your collar lol it sounds stupid but it'll hide the hickey. Also, lay low until it goes away; stay in your room a lot, and if you have to be around your parents, make sure you keep them on the other side of your neck!|`|5a6e74148a3ae8aafbeabe8aa23b975faa	Let me get this straight....You  and your BF want your parents to trust you when you're trying to hide something from them? Get real!! Then get honest with yourself. Chances are, your parents had hickeys too and know why they're there. But lying or hiding things isn't the way to go about life. Anyways, you need to be up front with your parents in order for them to trust you fully. What are you going to do if /when they find out the truth?  Forget your boyfriend... The real question is, in the future, will your parents trust YOU?  <br>  .A hickey will be gone in a few days but your conscience will live on for the rest of your life and before you know it, you'll be hiding your way out of every bad situation. Ok... so much for the lecture. I see your problem. So on to the solution.<br>  A good alcohol rub should take care of things.Rub alcohol over the hicky 3 or 4 times a day. A hickey is no more than excess blood at the top of the skin caused by your BF sucking on your neck. Take for example a leach feeds this way and the results are a so called hickey.However, it's still going to take a few days for the blood to disappear. Even then, according to the depth, or severeness of the hickey, it still may leave a bruise like or brown appearance on your neck. But rubbing it with alcohol will help speed the healing. Nothing is going to hide it unless you wear a heavy makeup or maybe a turtle neck. So there's really nothing you can do but face the music until the blood disappears and the hickey heals. Or better yet, use a topical ointment such as Neosporin. <br>  On the other hand, I've always heard that rubbing the area with the back of a spoon will make a hickey disappear in a couple of days. Try that. Otherrwise, good luck with your parents!|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Okay put a spoon in the freezer, and then after about an hour press the spoon to your hicky (it helps it go down.) Otherwise just use A LOT of coverup. And don't try and hide it obviously otherwise it'll seem obvious your covering it up therefore you can't pull the "Oh I don't know what that is either" or the "I hit myself my accident" card.|`|AA10928214	if you want you're parents to trust them then you shouldn't have let him do it in the first place, or he should have known not to do it.

He was embarassed, you've been embarassed, but the bottom line is that you love each other or you wouldn't have made it this long together.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	wow, im so sorry. men are so confusing. you know what? let him have a taste of life without you. most likely he'll run back. its up to you to decide at the point if you want to grace him with your love or not.<br>  <br>  <3|`|VUKDrd2taa	No one will ever understand anything that boys do, i actually heard somewhere that men are slightly brain damaged while being born. makes since huh lol? but i think you are doing the right thing telling him to get out, i had a jerk ex bf to, stick to it, if he was really sorry you would know.<br>  good luck.|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	wow...this def not normal...u should talk to him about it|`|8th9KY1haa	This one is EASY sweetie.<br>  The BOY got cold feet.<br>  Give back the ring and stand back few steps, and watch.....<br>  If he moves on and dates other girls than sorry to say he just wanted you for you know what and had no intention to marry you.<br>  If he on the other hand does not pursue other females than give him some time to "Warm Up His Feet"<br>  Good Luck.|`|AWSnd88laa	If a man is embarrassed by his fiance showing him affection dump him before you get to the alter.And what kind of church is this that couples married for years don't show pda's?I know people married for 20 years that still kiss in public!|`|FeEU1IDOaa	So you sniffed him...and THAT prompted all of this? Come on. He's hiding something else. Has he been acting a little weird for a few days now, maybe in an unusually bad mood? Because his reaction to you getting a whiff of his cologne was completely unnecessary. It was a huge overreaction. It sounds to me like he's been wanting to pick a fight with you for awhile now and jumped on the first thing he could...which was something stupid. I think he's hiding something from you. And if I were you, I'd think about whether he might have an eye on someone in the church.|`|FoGliXfvaa	I think you guys need to relax. it sounds like things are spiraling out of control. I understand he embarrassed you by elbowing you after a playful 'sniff', he clearly overreacted and needs to apoligize for that. but you two need to sit down, chat & kiss and make-up. Dont worry after 6 years things will get better. couples have fights like little things like this all the time. i would atleast apologize and tell him you didnt mean to 'embarrass' him for playfully sniffing him, you just wanted to smell his cologne. tell him sorry if he had a bad day! but he didnt need to ELBOW you away!|`|TEU3Attwaa	Wow, that was long but I read all of it, finally.  <br>  <br>  First off let me say you two sound very disfunctional.  Grow up, both of you and realize that this petty shyt is gonna ruin two lives.  I hope you don't have kids together.<br>  <br>  Now, with that said let me get down to the meat.  How long have yall been together?  Ok, you sniffed him in church.  How many times do you see people walking around smelling their mates?  That was a little ridiculous.  Yeah, his reaction was a bit strange too but if you didn't do what you did he wouldn't have done what he did.  Bottom line, you started this.  You were happy to see him but you were still in church.  That can be a stuffy place anyway but for you to be walking up to your man because you hadn't seen him all day long and then sniff him I probably would have done the same thing to my man.  I'd have been like, "get off me."  Yes, I would have.  See, many of those who responded wanted to blame the guy for just pushing you off but I counsel women and let them know that times are changing and it's not always about what we want anymore.  This man said you made him uncomfortable but that didn't register with you.  You, as a woman, feel that you should be able to show your man affection anywhere you want.  Men don't like PDA's that much or as much as women so cut him some slack.  Then you say you intentionally haven't talked to him since then because of it.  That too is just as childish as him pushing you away.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you two need to keep your hands to yourself for a while.|`|f87315b5de13cf147ccc4c47945717fdaa	id say give him the ring back! in fact throw it at him. or seriously consider if this is someone you want to spend the rest of your life with...|`|fpOzMCNNaa	Sounds like there might be a bigger issue behind it, and this is just how it came out. Hope it works out for you.

MWjNp6y3aa	She probably just wants to be honest with you and let you know that you are her man. She is into you and you shouldn't be frightened of them. She probably likes the normal human perspective you give and not the screwed up one they have. Just have a good time with her and let her know you love her and you are glad that she is your girl.<br>  <br>  Don't worry dude. Hot girls get that kind of attention. The bf of said hot girl just better not show that he is scared or she will feel she is not protected well enough by a secure man and will leave. Be secure with her and yourself and you will be plenty fine. I love it when guys take notice of my girl because I know they can't have her and that she is all mine. It's sort of fun.|`|Y4eEcXLeaa	You should trust her. Tell her you trust her and baisically i would stay close to her as much as possible to remind her of why she chose you which is probably because your not a posh boy! you have to rember you have somthing all those other guys didn't have and thats why she likes you and if she is telling you about it tell her how you feel... make sure to say why did you have to be so beautiful and also make sure to tell her how you feel about the guys hitting on her

Just dress cool, look good, make sure you dont have snot coming out of your knose, and just try to drop some comments that are definitely sexual, and not casual. Do not get into the friend zone. Make sure she knows you like her but don;t just say "I like you", imply it throughout the night. Flirt with her, buy her movie ticket or whatever, simple kind gestures like that. But like i said drop some comments that definitely imply you are interested in her and why she should be intersted in you, dress to impress, clean yourself up, and be yourself.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Focus on HER 100%.  Don't think about whether she likes you.  Think about her.  Focus on what she's telling you about, what she's REALLY saying underneath that (if she tells you about schoolwork today, is she worried about how hard it is, or something, and can you help her to worry less about it somehow?).  When you feel nervous, think of how nervous SHE probably feels instead of focusing on yourself.  Give her your full attention, and she'll know you're interested in her, and not just in whoever can make YOU happy.<br>  <br>  Oh, and DO compliment her by telling her she's cute, since you've said you think that.  But wait for the right moment, when you see it really strongly in something she does, and she'll see the smile she caused on your face as you say it.|`|q5YB1RBMaa	DO NOT FOCUS on being cool, it is really crappy, and chances are if you need help hanging out with a girl you aren't quite a lady-killer (no offense I am probably the most "unlady-killer"alive) I find that girls like it when you embrace your flaws, for example, I am kind of lanky, when I poke fun at this, it one shows that you are confident, and in turn, cool|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	just don't overdo it.<br>  don't try to be someone you're not.<br>  lol. i know that's what you said you didn't wanna hear, but it's true.<br>  fakeness is one thing a lot of people can't stand.<br>  <br>  just be slick, but don't be pervy either.<br>  say clever things,<br>  impress her.<br>  be funny.<br>  =]|`|0qylty8Oaa	talk about things she is interested in if she is on a sport team from school ask her how training is going or go to a movie and on the way back talk about the movie <br>  be creative|`|euOtDB3Baa	do whatever keeps her comfortable, even conversation-wise  <br>  bring your sense of humor and be willing to listen to her|`|zNkuENeHaa	where are you hanging with her at?|`|szJSaZspaa	smoke some weed b4 u go and it will be cool.|`|qv25Q4aaaa	have a sense of humor around her, girls love funny guys, but nothing too stupid like "why did the chicken cross the road" or anything cheesy like that, and nothing sexual.<br>  <br>  make sure to wear some cologne, but not too much, the girl doesn't want to smell you from across the street.<br>  <br>  and above all "be yourself" LOL seriously man everyone says that because it's true, a girl doesn't want you to be fake, she wants to see YOU|`|KH0RGuVwaa	-Be funny.<br>  -Be mellow, talk to her, but not about dude stuff like football and sports. talk about things that you WOULDNT say to your guy friends.

You should be fine. That's how my guy trapped me.|`|0IUIzqoaaa	Be yourself. Girls hate fakes. also be funny and break the ice.

It's more uncomfortable than anything else. It's kind of a sore/stretching feeling. Very weird. But you can handle it, I promise! It's nothing to be afraid of. <br>  <br>  Also, the whole "cherry" thing is a myth. Your hymen was probably broken a long time ago, if you rode a bike as a child or have ever ridden a horse, masturbated, or anything like that. There won't be a popping noise and a gush of blood or anything. You might bleed some, but it won't be a whole lot. You can keep a towel under your butt if you're worried about it, and maybe a pantiliner in your pants pocket for later, but you probably won't even need that.|`|LBbKmemxaa	I'm an eighteen year-old guy, who just had sex for the first time last week. It didn't hurt her, but she said it was "uncomfortable" - and until you both get more experienced, it's going to be awkward. Still good, though! Remember foreplay!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Yes and unless you are married, you may end up with a popped cherry and a ripped vagina when that baby comes out hon.<br>  Then you may end up raising it alone on welfare.<br>  You might want to rethink this some more.|`|wv9XWQqCaa	Yes, it's painful in the beginning, but eventually you'll loosen up.

Sex is not just all about the physical act itself, but requires a certain amount of mental and emotional maturity to handle any emotions that come with it. <br>  <br>  Most women say their first time having sex hurt, but that is not to say that it might not hurt for you. Plenty of foreplay should help to relax you, and it also helps if your partner is someone who you care about & that they know it is your first time. When a guy knows that, he is usually a little more gentle than if you weren't a virgin ... <br>  <br>  When your "cherry pops" (which is actually your hymen breaking) there will be blood ... Like some of the others have said here, it won't be much - just like a very light day of your period. You probably won't even be able to tell until you go to the bathroom .<br>  <br>  Another thing that cannot be stressed enough is that you need make sure that HE wears a condom. They will provide you some protection against a number of STDs, and a possible pregnancy (yes, you can get pregnant the first time - I've known girls who did). You will also want to keep some lube closeby in case the condom gets dry or you experience some dryness ...<br>  <br>  The first time is not all magic like you read in books or see in the movies ... There is no magical afterglow and, unless you are involved with your partner, there is no romance to the whole thing. If you are smart, you would wait until you are married and let your wedding gift to your husband be your virginity ... <br>  <br>  Whether you take any of this to heart or not, good luck to you ... Don't make any rash decisions and think things through thoroughly - just in case there is an accident condom break (yes the do break). My one rule for when I was finally ready was whether or not I could look myself in the mirror the next morning ... I was emotionally and mentally ready for sex, but that is an individual choice and decision ... Good luck to you ...|`|IEZr9yjhaa	Sometimes it hurts sometimes it doesn't. It depends. If you're going to have sex for the first time, make sure that he uses a condom. And if he cares about your feelings he will take his time with you. Guys that are only out for themselves and don't care about your feelings, then I would say if he is one of those guys, it will hurt and you should wait for a guy that really cares about your feelings. You have your whole life to have sex. That is something very precious that you should save for that very special guy. You know what kind of reputation girls get who have sex just to have it. And once you get a bad rep, you will have it for a very long time. My advice is to wait.|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	8 out of 10 it will def hurt, it will feel like someones tryna park a truck into a space meant for a scooter, it'll hurt, but if its the right time and the right person, it'll be special and they'll go easy on you<br>  <br>  p.s sex is special so i hope itll be with the right person. dont just give up your virginity to anyone|`|3rqd6N29aa	It might hurt, it might not.  Hard to say cause everyone is different. <br>  DO NOT give it up just cause you want to.  Trust and believe.  It will be akward and embarrasing if its just some dude.  When you love the person, it might hurt but its kinda that "hurt so good" type thing. <br>  <br>  If youre young, please please please wait till you are ready for everything that comes with sex.  Its better and less sloppy when youre in love and have communication and trust.|`|ASlObUaIaa	most likely it will hurt the first time.  and the next few times afterwards possibly.  Your hymen popping...depends on how secure with your body you are, whether or not the guy you are with knows its your first time, or if anyone faints at the sight of blood.  But really, if you don't already know the answers at least somewhat to these questions, you should rethink whether or not you really want to go through with this at this point in your life.  Good luck.|`|mWEQzvOzaa	If you're under 15 don't do it....My friends little brother got a girl pregnant and now the families are forcing them to marry each other...So think twice before you do it...I would do it but im just to scared lol....It will be awkward if your cherry pops...And the answer is yes is hurts for everyone the first time of sex and it will be really QUICK..|`|Hm4kzzsaaa	um you should not have sex until your married and if you are married to this guy then if you want babies don't use a condom but if you don't want babies then use a condom and it won't hurt if you tell him to take it easy and don't go hard but don't have sex unless your married|`|tx6nO4XKaa	yes, like hell. then you'll scream for him to stop. then he will tell everyone at school that you are a slut. make sure this guy is someone that you are in love with and trust and loves you and cares for you back or what i just described will happen|`|pZ8evSJ0aa	If you are in love then the awkwardness won't matter, because it will be love and passion not just sex. And yes for most girls it does hurt but if you're with someone you love, again, it won't be so bad because he will care about you.|`|6314028188428ab1021f98b5e27f0f7caa	The guy needs to take it easy, no porn stuff.

And it does not take a week, it takes a lifetime to make yourself valuable and LET TIME PASS.

For your relationship to wok, U two must maintain trust, communication, and a mutual respect for each other. If there's a problem, talk about it. And don't ever end a conversation if your mad at each other, that could lead to U running out and doing something you'll regret later.

WLsS5vxsaa	She needs to move on. It sounds to me that he is trying to have a back up plan (your niece) in case his new relationships fail. It is a total boody call. If he doesn't want to be in a committed relationship with her why would she want him back or wanna go to the prom with him.<br>  What she needs to do is to stop waiting for him and find somebody who deserves her. Somebody who will love her, respect her and want to give her the world. There are a lot of good boys out there.|`|JXGx04qOaa	she obviously needs to stay away from this guy.  notice he ran back to your niece after the break up with the other girl.  he's just enjoying being able to go back and forth between 2 girls and they BOTH allow it.  if she's as good of a girlfriend as you say she is, she'll find someone who actually deserves someone like her.  i can't even begin to comprehend why she would want to be with him.  [honestly, what does it say about a senior guy who'll date a freshman girl?  he's got no set of standards whatsoever.]<br>  <br>  if your niece got back together with him, they would surely continue to have problems and it would ultimately end in her getting hurt again.  it's best she doesn't waste her time.
Y9nR8GAzaa	When you see her in the hallway just walk towards her, head on and just call her name. MAKE SURE SHE IS ALONE, if she's with a friend or someone and you tell them to go, then they might start something around the school. So, pull her aside and just come out with it. Don't ask her out yet, because you don't know if she likes you. If you ask her out and she doesn't even like you then you'll feel like a total idiot. So just tell her you like her then see what her reaction is. Even if she says she likes you too, DON'T ask her out yet, play it cool... If she says she doesn't feel that way, just look hurt, it always gets her feeling sorry for you. She will probably just say something like "We can still be good friends though" Also tell her to keep it between you two. Like you said, you don't want to make a big scene of it.|`|LEO4i4Yjaa	just tell her in private that i have a crush on u.

FLeEdSTxaa	Well the place that you take her depends on her personality and your personality. If she is more outgoing, you would probably want to hang out somewhere, like a smoothie shoppe (It's my personal favorite because it's a more social atmosphere). If you are a little reserved or in between, you should probably go bowling or something that is competitive, because it will probably bring out your personalities a little more. Or just find something you guys are interested and do it. (For example, you both like skiing, you would go skiing). I don't think the movies is the greatest place to go because you just sit down for two hours in a dark room watching a movie, and after that you still don't get to know each other more. So yeah, I hope you don't think my ideas are corny.|`|ptWHIVjZaa	You could just go out to dinner in a local diner or something, but nothing too fancy.

c833y7JZaa	Assault has a statue of limitations. In most state's its about one year but I'm almost 100 percent sure they would charge you with battery. If you committed the act under the age of 18 I doubt you would be tried as an adult (unless their is something serious your not telling us or if you were 17). Battery, in most states is a 5 to 4 year statue of limitations. So unless like i said theirs other stuff to the story, or if you were a juvenile offender, i doubt they would bring any charge's to you. The worse case you would maybe have to deal with is your parents, also I am really skeptical that they would beat you up over this especially if you were young or your sister had serious problems after the fall. For instance if she is paralyzed or has or is experiencing other problems, i again think that the law could barley punish you. You also would have no key witness in a trial and you can use your sister's lack of memory as an offense. To sum it all up i doubt any charges will be brought to you in this case.

Look at a wide variety of schools.<br>  <br>  I made the decision to go to a school near my now ex-gf, and although I don't necessarily regret it, I could have saved a lot of money going to another school.

Seriously!|`|EdDpecQgaa	I think that your reasons to college should be because of your interest, not your boyfriend. Because you never know what happens with boyfriends, so don't decide on a college specifically because of your bf. but if you are interested in the school, even if you bf wasnt going there, consider it. its hard but try to imagine the school without your boyfriend going to it, is it more appealing? or less?|`|BPqK0c5taa	Sounds to me like it works out perfectly. You get to be with your boyfriend everyday and you get to go to a good school. I don't think he would mind and if he does then that's just weird because I would love to go to college with my girlfriend that would be pretty awesome.<br>  <br>  Try talking to him about it and see what he thinks.|`|djgpu2qNaa	You have to get real. There is a very strong possibility that you two will break up between now and when you go to college, so you can't use his presence as a reason to attend the school.|`|dUeDmb7raa	naah you should move on with your high school life after high school and accept that college is different and leave yourself open to whatever happens<br>  <br>  <br>  its no fun to go to college tied down|`|OQSdjIcoaa	Normally i would consider this a good idea, great to see him of course and such but if you guys are to ever break up will you regret your decision?|`|PoKFN58haa	Sure! You will have fun together!|`|oXRZfAWaaa	sounds like a rotten idea, unless you break up with him first.|`|GDJGvyj5aa	Being long-distance with my boyfriend only made his skankiness come out sooner.  We went to different colleges and he lived it up!  But he would have done it eventually anyway, so I'm glad it came out before we got married.  Live your life, don't let a guy determine your future.

Hence your complaint on your mother is incomplete and baseless. If you are a girl this is nothing but allergy towards same sex. As I know boys are good with their mothers and girls are good with their Fathers. This is also an attraction to opposite sex. Opposite sex attracts. Same sex repels. Stop discriminating this attitude ASAP. Learn to adapt human values.<br>  She may be feeling lonely and depressed for some obvious reason, which you are not disclosing.<br>  I am a widower, lonely and depressed and for me death is more acceptable than an empty life.<br>  Nobody is going to live in this world for ever. Life is short and try to make it sweet. Just support your mother with unconditional love.<br>  or else you will become alone and unwanted in this world.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	"Hi Mom, great to hear from you again. I'm in the middle of something, is it urgent?"<br>  <br>  That will get her to think before calling. I get a bit irrated when my mom calls too, because she talks about stuff I don't have much interest in. But she's my mom so I try to visit her once a week to catch up, and that seems to help. One day you won't have her, so try to be nice!|`|rkZhVpvgaa	You should know that it is your mom's nature.  May be she is over protective in your case.  But you try to understand her and give patient hearing to her.  What she wants is your betterment & welfare.  You are behaving like you do now because of your age.  You may be thinking that you are no more a child.  But for your parents you are always a child. It is difficult to change one's nature.  So, plz don't get irritated and try to control and keep yourself cool. Tolerance is a very good quality, you know? This will help you a lot in your future life.|`|DS21ekeJaa	I used to get that way, too!  I just let her talk now and don't take it too seriously when she starts the judgement crap.

I cringe when my mother calls me and I see her name on the caller ID.|`|fKZJYqDraa	well idk about your culture but in mine its realy disrespectful to hang up on someone especialy your mom ;) On the other hand its also rude of your mom to not let you speak.... Tell her how you feel. Tell her that if she wants to have a one-sided conversation then she should hit up the door or perhaps a family pet.. The best you can do is tell her how you feel and that it irritates you when she persists on having a one-sided conversation. Good-Luck!!!|`|ZTVr2V3xaa	well your 18 now and on your own so she needs to realize that and try to give you some space and let you make your own choices and mistakes because thats a normal part of life and thats how we all learn.Your mother is supposed to be there for you even when you do make wrong decisions for comfort not to make you feel worse.She is your mother though so you need to have some respect for her and dont be rude as hard as it may be, just talk to her and tell her how your feeling. hope this helps good luck|`|0BR3V98vaa	lol yeah.. my mom does tha same thing.. and if i dont answer the call she keeps calling and eventually starts calling my friends phone. i usually tell her im doing homework or watchin a movie and ill call her back, just say that right when you answer the phone... and try not to hang up on her.. jus be like "hello, hi mom.. ill be home later and ill call you in a hour" and answer her before she speaks and if your like me and you get so stressed, her call ruins your day... just try to call her every once in a while and like i said tell her exactly what time ur going home but tell her a few hours then what you really are thinking to make her stop calling and just call her around the time u told her and be like "hey mom.. can i stay for a few more hours for blah blah blah" and try to talk nice|`|j6nYjqdxaa	LOL THATS PERFETLY NORMAL IM 22 AND THAT STILL IRRITATES ME EVEN THOUGH IM A MOTHER MYSELF AND IT HURTS TO SAY MY SON GETS IRRITATED TO HAHAHA ITS A CYCLE|`|XJsH7pB1aa	She is a mother...mothers bug.  I moved out at 16- that's how bad she irritated me. My mom calls me if she could a million times, if I don't answer the hm. phone, she calls the cell, and if no answer there she calls my hubby- oh and she never fails to leave a message on EACH vm lol, and she always starts off with "Hi, its me your mom" ughhhh yeah I know.  She gets irritated with my grandma, and like someone else stated I am sure my kids will get irritated with me as well. She means well really, they judge and will always let you know how you can do things different, or how you are ruining your life.  I will say though if she doesn't call I get worried, and I love her because in the  end there is only one.  Give it time I think its because you are in that "I AM INDEPENDENT" stage. Just don't take her for granted.

hcgaizJCaa	Your first step is to stop comparing yourself to the old guy. He's not relevant. She married you.<br>  <br>  The economy is tough for everyone. And, for the record, accountants generally don't make all that much starting out. Any income is better than no income.<br>  <br>  If you're not doing well in school, you can either buckle down and make it happen or quit. Either way, don't waste money and time you don't have.<br>  <br>  Your wife can't work because she has a kid?? No, no, no. That's just an excuse. Her daughter is 8, doesn't she go to school? Why can't your wife work those hours? <br>  <br>  Your stepchild doesn't respect you - it's mom's job to make that happen. She needs to sit down with her and explain that you are not her father, but you are an authority figure and her insolence will not be tolerated.<br>  <br>  A REAL husband loves his wife unconditionally and wants her to be happy. A REAL husband supports her and cherishes her. A REAL husband knows that money is only a tool.|`|8ee4GpfRaa	You are stressed out, and feel helpless.<br>  Even though you take on more responsibility than an average 24 year old, it is actually a general feeling of our age. Not to mention  millions of americans going through financial crisis. myself included<br>  <br>   Now is a time that you feel like you need to give up. You feel guilty. How will she feel if you divorce her?<br>  Will she really be better off, or will she have emotional problems? It is more important to support someone financially or keep your word and get through hard times and good times? <br>  <br>  The only reason for divorce is if you guys no longer are meeting each other's emotional needs, and no longer communicating well with each other. ANY other problem is something you can fix together. <br>  <br>  PLEASE read Gottman on 4 horses of the apocalypse. Please. It will help you if you guys are arguing, etc, and you can tell then if you guys can meeeach othersrs needs or if it's too late.<br>  <br>  All of these circumstances are going to change. You are going to grow into your own more mature person, but that takes time, and you can spend that time together growing as long as you both want to grow and don't put each other down. <br>  <br>  Good luck buddy!|`|EhLYiIZ2aa	I'm not going to lie and say that your situation is alright, but it's not as bad as others I've seen (two of my adult friends got divorces because of long-term abuse). I think you and your wife should seek professional help, like go for marriage counselling. Only a professional will be able to access your situation. Also, as she has been hurt in her past by that ex-husband of hers, you wouldn't want to hurt her again, do you? So I do think that you should go and seek professional help instead of getting a divorce immediately. <br>  <br>  As for the little girl, it's neither your fault nor hers. She's reacting like most little kids do when their parents remarry-she's afraid that you would 'take away' her mom. To top it all off, she probably had a traumatic experience when her own father abused her mom. She probably has the wrong impression that all men are bad, and therefore, is reacting to you that way to get back at her dad. Try your best to guide and LOVE (this is the most important thing) her and I'll assure you one day, she'll look up to you as the father figure her dad never was. (How much of a father figure is an abusive guy anyway?) <br>  <br>  The bottom line is, your wife chose you, not that rich, wealthy business man. Sure, you may have 'captivated' her, but if she was really serious about the older guy, she wouldn't care, right? So this proves that she loves you, not him. Like I said before, it is most advisable to seek professional help before you do something you'd regret all your life. Alternatively, you could also sit your wife down and tell her you need help with the finances. Let her know you need to concentrate on your schoolwork. Good luck, and hope that you and your family situation would improve.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	No, it is time to pull yourself up by your boot straps son and get into gear.Get some help with your school work if you need to a tutor or something,and then start doing what your wife does to make the kid mind you.You need to be the adult with the kid and let her know who is boss.If you have to swat her butt a time or 2 then do it.<br>  Next, tell your wife, you are sorry money is tight, but once you have finished school, you will get a better job, just to hang in there.<br>  It doesn't hurt to pray either.<br>  You signed up for this, now dig in and stick with it,or you'll wish you had later.You fought for this woman so the other guy would not get her, now fight to make her happy.She obviously loves you,or she'd have booted you by now.|`|3dMoSQT2aa	Your life seems to be heading at a dead end at every angle. It may seem like that but have patience. Endure. First step for you would be to talk to your wife. Tell her that you do love her and tell her how you feel about her but also mention the fact that its harder than you thought. Tell her that love is beyond money and in these financial hardships you need her support. As for your daughter, start hanging out with her and do activities with her so you develope a relationship with her. Play some games together or teach her something she wants to learn. <br>  I wouldnt just get a divorce, because its not just about you, its also about your wife and your daughter. Try to focus in school, a C- is ok but try your best to finish because we all know that people with degrees get higher paying jobs. Your not really going to get any answers here because its your wife you really need to talk to. If she is unsatisfied with the marriage and expected more and your giving everything you got then your only option would be to leave the relationship. Thats more of a last case scenerio though. <br>  As for the "real husbands" who make enough money for both...thats not true. Especially in todays economy, she has to understand that there will be financial constraints and it cant be all about money. She also might of not had a better chance with an older wealthier man because he too might of been abusive and again, its not all about money. Good luck son.|`|6wzO4IOgaa	hey,<br>  no this is not a way out of a marriage. This is not even a close reason to file for a divorce.

She is "the tough one" and you are the stay at home type. <br>  <br>  Women usually marry older men, and men usually marry younger women.

That successful businessman is most likely in the poorhouse now, and at least you have a job. <br>  <br>  I don't think you need to get divorced, but a talk with your wife might help.|`|bBg41vPraa	im sorry to hear this is happening to you and your family. but if you love her and in love with her stay.$ doesn't make the man but you have to be satisfied with yourself b4 you can give to someone else.I doubt very seriously that she feels that she shouldn't have married you but you have to stand your grounds talk to her tell her how you feel. look school is something you commented yourself too if you quit that you midis well leave her. the 8 year old, remenber a child they will take advantage of any situation possible. your wife needs to address that not you that's not a little baby and you never no what anyone else could be telling that child. please talk to your wife you are a team now if she loves you like she vowed to do you guys can work it out.   GOOD LUCK!!|`|jxfby56raa	You've already connected with her. That means that no matter if you divorce, you will still love her. If she truly loves you though, she will understand. If I were you, I would show her this letter to honestly show my feelings. Besides that, become a best friend of the daughter. Know what she likes/dislikes and try to be responsible. Keep in school and aim for the highest possible, and try to get some purely responsible friends that can help you study.|`|nXAvk8B8aa	you really touched me i wish there were more men in the world like you but things take time and if she loves you she'll help and stick around and support you she knew what she was getting herself into when she said i do and as for her daughter she's young but not a baby anymore it'll take some time for her to except you as her step parent and none less form some type of respect for you maybe you should sit her down and explain your not trying to take her dad's place you jus want a nice relationship with her for her mothers sake as for her mom i say agian if she loves you yall can think of something i hope this helps|`|nw1VFvxNaa	Wow, I wish there were more guys like you out there. It's apparent that you truly love your family. You are trying to hard to please them. The key to being a good father is love. You are still new to the child. You have to show her that you love her but that you are the boss. Be firm. But also listen to her.<br>  As for your wife... talk to her. Let her know what's going on in your mind. The fact that you are trying so hard to please and support her says a lot for your character. You need to also take time for your self. Keep the lines of communication open. Let your wife know you need help with the bills. Then you might be able to finish school easier. And finishing school will take lots of burden off of you. <br>  Just don't give up on your marriage. Pray...|`|diQ0oodqaa	If it was me, I'd sit down and talk to here exactly like you said it here, have you tried that? She should have a voice in this decision you are seemingly making alone. Stop putting yourself down, you sound like a great guy and she may want love more than an older, richer guy. Try talking to her about it.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	1st of all, being a step-parent is the hardest of your problems. But mom can make the daughter understand that she has to listen to you. Then you have to earn her respect. But be her friend. Not her replacement father. 2nd how did your wife manage before she met you? Did she work and care for her daughter alone? If she did then she can work now and help you with the bills. Also, you need to finish your education. And you need to sit down with your wife, talk to her and sit a budget. If she loves you as much as you say, she will stick by you and help out more. If she don't or won't, you have your self a gold digger. Good luck
N39uQiZMaa	I'm sorry, but I disagree with her. Dating many just to have the right mate and have children? That's the worst reason I've ever heard for one to be allowed to date many. That's not really comfortable right? Talk to her, be frank and honest. Tell her that things would really work up if  she continues dating up with many boys. In this moment, let your love and pride take balance. Why? There is a possibility of her testing you. Just as I said a while ago, to have the right mate is a very weak immature reason to date many boys. What if that is not true? What if she just wants your reaction and answer about that? If you say "okay, you can date many", you're just proving that you don't care for her, that you don't love her. But if you say "no, you shouldn't do that. If you do that, I will try to stop the other guys", well, you've proven you really loved her and this maybe is the only answer she's waiting for. But beware, I don't know if this is true or not. The best thing to do for now is play safe. Don't give all to her, for you may just be giving everything on a just a piece of stone, and would have nothing to give on the true diamond of your life. But then she may as well be that diamond. But maybe she's not. It's your choice and hers. That's it.|`|pcBmyGTZaa	Hahaha, what a whore. <br>  <br>  Get rid of her because she just likes to play around with people and be a slapper.|`|TYwyRt9taa	Well if she is dating more than one person right now, and your one of her many, than this means that your not the right guy for her, because if you were, she would ditch all those other guys she's dating.  It's time to move on.  And also it is just as wrong for a girl to date more than one person as it is for a guy, unless you have an open relationship where it works both ways.  Another thing could also be about you guys having a good time and talking, this could mean she is a very likeable person, hence her having more then one guy at a time.|`|14tr16uuaa	pssh.... She's keeping you on a leash. So she can go out and have fun while you wait on the side lines. <br>  <br>  If you truely like her man up and get into a relationship, but if she keeps going out with the boys, you are just wasting your time.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	she is playing safe. she wants to play the field but just in case she cant find any she wants to make sure she got you. move on without her. good luck.|`|jwmunyQeaa	what a slut. dump her and find someone else!|`|x7mtcya1aa	you may be dating the older woman, but it sounds like your wisdom is beyond her years. everything in a relationship should be equal from the very beginning. if she chooses to date freely, than that right is yours too. and if you dont want an open relationship, and she doesnt agree, then find someone else who has a more mature viewpoint.|`|KhnfO5kAaa	well of course its wrong to date anyone else while dating someone. Even if what she says is true its wrong. If she thinks that you are the one that she truly wants then she wouldnt need to date anyone else. no offence but shes kinda got things wrong in her head
fpaVxnclaa	Well like my other answer if you dont want to be a lesbian then you are most likely not!Maybe you are just realizing how much she means to you as your best friend?You should take a while and think about this,and truly decide if you like her more than a friend.Dont worry you are going through some major changes and its probably just a phase or your hormones.You shouldnt worry about being a lesbian unless you are attracted to other girls or if you see a girl and think she is hott or something like that.Hope I helped!|`|8vuOwZHuaa	Uhhhhhh that's kinda wierd but I'm not critsizing. Um you could try getting to know boys and hanging out with them and maybe even ask one out maybe it will work but this is just a thought|`|AA11382993	You probably just feel this way because you are close friends or maybe your jealous of her but you just don't realize it. Thing like that have happened to me. don't worry about it.|`|ckM1lYwoaa	You're probably bi.<br>  If you like her go for it.<br>  Try talking with other people you think are bi in your school.
FZKFLTyLaa	Be frank, and honest. Just ask :<br>  Would it offend you if I considered you as more than just a friend (or classmate)? Do you know how much I like you?<br>  I cannot understand in this age of communications why so many people have such great difficulty<br>   just speaking to one another.
H7UphlLCaa	one of those stupid singing hamsters|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Any type of kitchen appliance.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	a vacuum cleaner, or a toaster.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	I disagree with a lot of these.  I would LOVE any kitchen appliance, since I spend so much time in the kitchen.  My mom insists the best anniversary gift she ever received was a new washer and dryer (It's what she had been asking for for a while), I would be very very happy with a vacuum because the one I have now is a hand me down and is so much noisy than the newer ones.<br>  <br>  I would say the only gift that is a bad gift (From a husband to a wife) is a gift that is thoughtless, one that shows he did not think about what she would have wanted, and doesn't know what she likes.<br>  <br>  I have never received such a gift from my guy, but an example of such a gift for me would be wine.  I don't drink, but for some reason people insist upon giving me wine near the holidays.  I also received a martini set once.  It shows they really don't know me.  But I still thank the gift giver, and keep it to offer others at parties, so at least it isn't totally useless.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Exercise equipment, kitchen appliances, cleaning supplies. I'd take clothes, purses, or shoes over all that anyday.<br>  <br>  A gift card is ideal.|`|w2Z1SV1Gaa	ANYTHING related to weight-loss (Weight Watchers, Jenny Craing, ANY gym, etc.).|`|dCmSA6r2aa	iron|`|eawDlYHnaa	i wouldn't ever want to receive junk. junk as in useless stuff to have around the house. this might include potpourri, bath sets (like shower gel, foot cream, etc), figures to just set around the house, etc. <br>  i'm the type of person who puts thought in any gift or card i choose to give and thats just the person i am. i cant help but hate it when i give someone something so meaningful and i just get a box set of something off a walmart shelf. ...sorry.  i'm in no way asking for anything expensive (bc i like homemade gifts too since they are from the heart) but common put some effort towards what youre giving someone!! if you truly cannot think of anything a gift card would be better than junk.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	somethign that benefits you. ex: kitchen appliances that she would use to cook you meals with or like my husband he got me a gps system for xmas but he tends to use it more than i do. the xmas before he got me jawbone bluetooth and it currently sits in his car and i havent used it in months because he's always using it. lol think of things for her not for u|`|QtaPF83iaa	Anything really expensive we have better things to spend our money on other than buying gifts for me.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Power tools.|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Any household items that if she uses them, is work.

DGrbpbq1aa	It depends on how thorough an exam. A gyno, can tell if the hymen ("hi men!" lol) is broken; but most physicians in my experience don't do that, as it's not their specialization. <br>  <br>  Either way, you should be honest with your doctor about your sexual relations. If you're worried about parents, it is within your rights to demand that they leave the room at the time of the exam & the doctor doesn't share the information with them.|`|9Y4tj2Yfaa	Well the doctor can tell if your hymen is broken but some people are born without hymens and they can be broken by activities as well (such as gymnastics etc.) so no they can assume it but there is no guarentee unless you tell them.
pQGUPITeaa	So many guys have told me light blue that I think it has to mean something.<br>  <br>  (And I don't mean just on me, I mean just general comments on lots of different girls. I've noticed if a girl is wearing light blue, a guy will nearly always say something about her outfit).|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Don't care.  Any color is fine.|`|AA11073512	Most guys really don't care about what color, as long as the clothes are stylish and not tacky. Wear whatever you like, and whatever you feel confident in. Girls have better taste with clothes anyways, haha.
50OVH54iaa	I didn't even read all of it, just the first sentence. Seriously, don't change yourself so you can get a boyfriend. Thats not what its about. Be yourself and you will find that someone.|`|LcweeMrLaa	Granted, I'm not a guy, but I would like to say that if the above description is truly and genuinely you don't change a thing!  You don't want a guy to be attracted to you for being someone you aren't, do you?  Even if you were to change something about yourself, if a guy was attracted to you only because of this change it would never last (most likely).|`|g3wGxdobaa	try to get on atleast one sport team i love girls who can look pretty are funny but also can show a little deication. =]|`|DZ8b5wVkaa	honestly, you sound like the perfect girl, dont change a bit|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	you are ok to me
AA10153769	for some reason i kinda prefer guys without glasses<br>  but most of the guys i like wear contacts lol<br>  but this is just my opinion since i've never met a guy that i liked that had glasses<br>  if a girl liked a guy, it doesn't matter whether or not he's wearing glasses or not...<br>  being someone who works hard at everything, i also have glasses (i switch from glasses to contact and vise versa whenever i feel like it)<br>  i've never felt as though my glasses held back anyone from asking me out<br>  it's more about confidence, not caring if you're wearing glasses or not.<br>  i know that when i first started, i was really worried about my appearance and everything, but now i'm okay<br>  glasses don't affect the appeal of a person<br>  as long as a girl isn't racist to glasses, then everything should be fine<br>  ^_~|`|Sh5pKTkTaa	No.<br>  I wear glasses.<br>  I love glasses.<br>  They make a person looks smart.|`|VsamHLPOaa	My story is similiar to yours except I started wearing glasses when I was 13 and now I'm 20. I had a problem with them at first but now there like a second skin. Can't function without them. But to answer your question let me tell you the tide is turning. There's nothing wrong with being nerdy if you are. More and more girls are starting to fall for nerdy guys because they are respectful and appreciative, two good qualities to find in a guy.<br>  I want to leave you with this saying that I like and it goes like this: Don't talk dirty to me. Talk nerdy to me. LOL.<br>  I''m sure you'll find a girl.|`|lTNxH1eeaa	Personally, I think glasses can EASILY add some sex appeal to a guy lol depending on how well they look on him I suppose...<br>  <br>  So long as they aren't the old 'Coke-bottle' types of lenses or some weird kinds of frames that I see some businessmen sporting nowadays (I'll find a picture link and send it to you sometime maybe haha)<br>  <br>  But absolutely, glasses can be very attractive!!! :)|`|BMIYf9okaa	This is not a stupid question. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I wear glasses, and have been since I was really young. I agree with the answer above, people wear glasses to help them see. <br>  <br>  I have seen many guys, and have guy cousins who wear glasses. I do not find them nerdy or intimidating|`|cb88569354fa813399bd99b338324ae4aa	Well, glasses can be flattering on some guys than on others if we ONLY go by looks. I guess for MOST people that's what pushes them to pursue a person. While some people may say they're not attracted to someone who wears glasses, they might not mean everyone. There's always an exception to a rule =) Glasses are just an aid to see better. It doesnt state if a person is smarter or nerdy. To make such statement you'd have to get know the person and confirm if it's true. Personally i find glasses hot in a lot of guys. Maybe bc I feel like they're trying to hide their personal beauty but showing enough to kind of tease me. My ex-fiancé used to wear glasses and i didnt mind. However when he took them off it was a bit of a breather and he looked good either way. <br>  <br>  I started wearing them when i was 13. Ah ha! Beat you by one year =) I wore them for a while but as young girl i felt i looked nerdy and got contacts. Recently, i developed an allergic reaction to a new brand so i got new glasses and honestly...i thought i looked weird at first. It wasnt until ppl said i looked good in them that i started believing it and now i like them =) I even think i look sophisticated (specially since ppl say i have the Sarah Palin look lol =/). Oops, i went off on a tangent here.|`|5rraSJRVaa	I personally like guys with glasses :)<br>  I had a major crush on this guy who wears glasses and he looks really cute in it. He looks really average when he doesn't wear his glasses and when he does, it's... WHOA! :D<br>  <br>  Well, I guess it all lies in whether your glasses look good on you or not. I'd advise you to try on every single pair of glasses in the shop (if you can!) to find something that suits you and makes you look good/smart, really! It does make a lot of difference.<br>  <br>  Glasses makes someone look intelligent and organized, in my opinion. The best thing is, my friend actually bought a pair of glasses (without any degree) because she thinks people look so gorgeous in them! :)|`|zW8tc64qaa	Dude, I wear glasses too (duh, avatar). I have gotten mixed views about it to be honest. I get told that I look smarter with them on. I don't see why there has to be a label associated with people who wear glasses though. Some people can't see well, and glasses are a solution to that problem. It doesn't have anything to do with being a nerd or intimidation. Trust me. If a girl doesn't want to date a guy because he can see better with glasses, maybe, just maybe, she isn't worth the time. Just sayin'|`|9Ywbz5w3aa	Okay..<br>  here's something :)<br>  <br>  I like this guy.<br>  and he's extremely.... hot. x)<br>  he also wears glasses sometimes.<br>  and to me.<br>  I honestly feel like he looks so much better with the glasses.<br>  He looks smart and sexy to me.<br>  and it sounds like he wears the same ones you do.<br>  just with a little bit of rim ^.^|`|W61p5bCfaa	hell no! glasses can be so hott on a guy! but rimless? try going for more city chic fashion, but still masculine, you kno? go to ur optomistrist and look for the hottest look for straight guys right now. trust me, if u have the right style, glasses look great!|`|uBGCvoktaa	honestly some guys look really good in glasses. i find that guys that do look good in classes have this clever witty thing goiin on. just dont be a know it all, not hot.|`|VqdKhj1saa	glasses are better,more sexy and complicated|`|a2b18MQ7aa	nerdy|`|heOz7p89aa	For some reason I always find guys with glasses attractive ;)<br>  <br>  I started using glasses when I was 18 years old.

WMR8hVlfaa	Er.. talking to someone online, as long as they're being honest and open, allows you to know their soul. People say stuff online that they might not when confronted with a person because the whole nervousness of face to face contact is erased. <br>  <br>  My best friend and her husband originally met online, yahoo personals to be exact. He was in Iraq at the time and they fell in love through an exchange of emails. They've been married for over two years now and have a fantastic relationship.<br>  <br>  Similarly, during the summer between our freshman and sophomore years of college my boyfriend and I spent hours talking online and got to know each other inside and out. I think it has a lot to do with why we have such a strong bond now.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	imagine this scenario.<br>  <br>  your boredly skimming thro some networking site. you get a random text from a guy. it's silly and flirty and inquires about something on your profile. you respond; he responds in kind, and you flirt a little bit. you ask him where he lives; you talk about that; he asks where you live; that too is conveyed. he asks what its like, you ask what his home is like. you ask about siblings; so does he. Names and nicknames are exchanged too. you find yourself liking the way he conveyes his thoughts, the way he phrases things, the way he talks to you as if you were not just a girl with a nice a** or a nice rack but a woman with a soul and mind and like he values you for that even though he's never met you and he makes you feel like you were settling by not waiting for someone who would love your soul and your mind and your emotions. you realize that you 'like like' him and so continue the conversation, even knowing that it would be folly to fall for him because of where you live in the world. you learn about his dating history; you tell him about yours. you find yourselves discussing romeo and juliet for some odd reason and find it incredibly suited. finally one of us has to depart but does say at the end that they would like to speak again. you feel the way you do when the guy you've been crushing on forever finally has the nerve to ask you out.<br>  <br>  anyway.
Ddfff5psaa	Both.  I'd check him out because I am just like that, I check everyone out.  Anyway, common perception of the muscular, hot, tall guy with the snug shirt is that he is cocky.

You're now starting to wish and hope that something would happen between you.  So it is an attraction, but you can't be sure it's love.  If it's love then you would go after him.

F0YIbT1eaa	Good question!!!  I guess when it's broken it needs to heal so that we can make room in our hearts to love again.  I always try to think of mine as  being a bit shattered instead of broken, it's easier for it to mend that way and takes a lot less time.   I'm in the process myself - it gets easier every day.  Hearts are only broken if we allow someone in that we shouldn't have let in to begin with..  I have no idea how we determine that from the beginning. Sure wish I could have known beforehand.  Now  I see it as part of life.   I guess we just find the strength to move forward and not look back.|`|gFwD0yeCaa	They've done studies on this and you actually love with your brain. There's a part of the brain that is activated when you're with, see or hear the person you love. They've also done studies that show love is a state of mind, meaning you can talk yourself into or out of being in love with someone.
lOfRbA54aa	We guys tend to be a bit thick when it comes to subtlety and signals. If you want him to know how you feel, the best way is to just say it. Anything less and he'll think you're justing being a friend.|`|So00Bd5zaa	Tell him in your most confident voice that you like him.|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Some time face to face will make both of you uncomfortable to talk to each other, why not call him and talk to him over the telephone, or text him then after sometime, he will be more comfortable with you then you might suggest for a date, it is OK for a girl to ask a boy for a date, as long as you think that you like him, and he is a good guy.|`|frj854Foaa	you can im me if you want to talk about it. i have some time.|`|atOr6SSAaa	I think get him when hes on his own, so it can just be you and him. Approach him with a smile and just politely say, 'Hey, I've been wondering if you'd like to hang out some time because I'd really like to get to know you."<br>  Just be confident and good luck!<br>  x.|`|oIC8gWjtaa	start easy, then gradually get together.<br>  1. talk to him. just walk up to him and say hi. if you need to, say something like, "i like your pants" or something<br>  2. continue this for a while and start making small conversation.<br>  3. ask him if he wants to hang out somewhere sometime.<br>  4. be friends, make normal, in depth conversation<br>  5. tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  when i told my friend i first liked him, it went like this:<br>  me: do you trust me?<br>  him: yea.<br>  me: wanna tell me who you like?<br>  him: not really<br>  me: wanna know who i like?<br>  him: sure, why not<br>  me: you.<br>  <br>  and just get it out in the open
c0102fddfeaef7a79d662d939f998e68aa	When it all comes down to it, you just have to ask yourself who you are happier with and let the other person know your decision. It is far better to choose who makes your happiest than choose the other because you feel bad.
AA11493831	Actually, they are related in ways. When you get attached to someone, it means that you already care about that person. You love being with him or her. And with time, if you get really attached to each other, love can happen. <br>  <br>  Because you already care about each other and you have great attachment with each other, eventually you can fall in love with each other. Not in all cases though. But it can happen, specially if the other person has romantic feelings for the other person.
282f3c3ef67f759a8388216dc595a9dbaa	yeah he likes you|`|S4lKGtPcaa	maybe hes just being nice
8ZUymjH2aa	Because they want u to know they are interested....|`|lB2N6n3yaa	You should just be flattered and proud that you have a nice enough butt, that they want to stare at it!
I1j4ixctaa	1. I enjoy it if i care about the guy i'm with. I've been having sex for a long time, if a guy doesn't care about you he won't take care of you and do it properly therefore it will hurt. But alot of the time when girls are yelling it's because they like the feeling.<br>  2. Yes, I've stopped a BF before because it felt to good and my body couldn't handle the pleasure.<br>  3. Because they're convinced that they are in love, and think that it won't happen to them.<br>  4. It's lust until your married. even if you really care for the person.|`|KW0hPZhxaa	1. Of course you enjoy it...why else would everyone be doing it?<br>  2. Yes, but it doesnt make you want to stop<br>  3. Not much danger of getting pregnant with alll which is available now.<br>  4. Either, both (if you are 15 more chance it means you are horny)|`|K0KYAcHpaa	Srry. I am still a virgin. Saving it for that special guy. I suggest you do the same.|`|yKcZC9Dhaa	1.yes, and no it doesn't hurt.<br>  2. you don't stop.<br>  3. because people who are ready for sex use protection.<br>  4. it means you are horny. love makes it better.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	1) yes it hurts at first but you get used to it then it starts feeling good<br>  2) maybe if your new to it but no if it feels good you dont want to stop<br>  3)because it feels good and to please their man and show them they love him, as well as they show that they are mature enough to handle it (plus they can use a condom to prevent pregnancy)<br>  4) could mean both, some do it becuz it feels good, others do it because they love each other, its personal preference|`|GCH45ITmaa	01) Yes I do and the reason for "yelling" is because it feels good, not because it hurts. (chances are it will only hurt the first time you have sex)<br>  <br>  02) I don't really get this one...<br>  <br>  03) You should always use protection - if you are going to have sex, go on the birth control pill and always use a condom.<br>  <br>  04) Both. Obviously you would be "horny" (for lack of a better word) but in my opinion, you should only have sex with someone if you deeply and truly love them. I've been with my boyfriend for three years, he is my best friend and we share everything. I think that you should wait until you've found the most amazing guy as I have. :) (By the way, I am 17  - make sure if you do have sex, you know you won't regret it)|`|KDW2tANfaa	1. I LOVE sex.. it hurts the first couple times but it's nothing you can't handle.  Most girls are screaming and yelling and moaning out of pleasure and while they orgasm, not out of pain.<br>  <br>  2. I've never had to stop.<br>  <br>  3. Because it feels SOO good!!<br>  <br>  4. Depends the situation, for me it means I'm horny.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|SlR0Cp5saa	1. still a virgin<br>  2. virgin<br>  3. Protection (ex. birth control, condoms)<br>  4. Depends on the situation. If you are with a different person every night then you're horny. If you are married or in a stable relationship then you're in love.|`|L0Quyt1Gaa	You are too young to worry about that anyways. I am 21 and still am. I have told the boyfriend I believe in love. Therefor I wish to wait. I see no point in jumping from one man to man.
TPRQDf5waa	no i definitely don't think that its weird. most guys are too shy to come up and talk to a girl. for some reason they seem to be intimidated by us most of the time. so you probably helped him out by suggesting something to do first.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	oooooh <br>   i actually did this for the first time yester day but it was an accident. <br>  i just knew that it was understood between me and himthat we were gonna hang out this week, so maybe that will make you more comfortable if you even know that he wants to go on a date with you. then it will be easier because he will almost surely say yes.<br>  so i just called him and got his voicemail and before i knew it i was asking if he was free to hang out thursday at night and to call me back if he wanted to.<br>  <br>  and loa nd behold he did and he told me he thought it was really cool of me to ask him and that it was "progressive".lol who knew <br>  i was just like<br>  wait ...did i ask you?<br>  <br>  <br>  can anyone answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApI2JvxGQiudWfMFzhKb0d_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304204822AAbO1kP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

HCTsrKAPaa	Hello there,<br>  <br>  First off, you're a very mature and smart young lady so well done to you. Secondly the age you are at is particularly awful and akward, I was exactly the same weight at your age and then when i was 15 and I started playing basketball, the weight just fell off and I got comfortable with myself. Trust me it will get better.<br>  <br>  Thirdly I'm sorry your home life is so difficult right now. Honestly, the recession is heightening everyones anxiety and depression. Its a stressful time and I'm sure your parents will sort themselves out one way or another. Don't worry, while you're very mature, your still a child technically. Do not take on your other family members issues.<br>  <br>  Do your own chores that's ok I know it's hard but you can do it and it'll make you stronger. But don't be guilted into doing your brothers. I think you should find some sort of camp to go away for the summer to get away from the stress your family is putting you through and prepare you for highschool. It will calm you down and you'll lose weight. Let me know if you need help to find something to do for the summer|`|j6nYjqdxaa	OK WHEN SOMETHING DOESNT DIRECT TO YOU KEEP IT OFF YOUR SCHEDULE LET YOUR BROTHER DO HIS CHORES THATS WHY THEY ARE HIS CHORES!!!<br>  <br>  YOUR DAD LEAVING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU THIS HAPPENS ON MANY FAMILIES YOU WILL LEARN TO COPE WITH THIS HIS PROBLEMS AND STRESS ARE HIS AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU!!!<br>  <br>  I UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTHER HAS PROBLEMS BUT THAT SHOULD ONLY MOTIVATE YOU TO KEEP GOING AND HELP HER YOU SHOULD NOT STRESS ON THIS... AS LONG AS SHE TAKES HER MEDICATION SHE WILL BE PERFECTLY FINE!!!<br>  <br>  YOUR WEIGH PROBLEM CAN BE OUT OF THE WAY BY COPING WITH REGULAR THINGS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU FEEL STRESS GO TO THE PARK AND WALK AROUND CARRY A BOTTLE OF WATER WHEREVER YOU GO IT HELPS WITH STRESS... I WAS OVER WEIGHT MYSELF WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I ACTUALL WEIGHTED 200 LBS AT THAT AGE YES THAT WAS A VERY DIFFUCULT AGE TO WEIGHT THAT MUCH I DIDNT DIET OR EXERCISE ALL I DID WAS WALK ALOT DRINK PLENTY OF WATER I EXCED THE 2LITERS A DAY WICH JUST WITH THAT MAKES YOU FUEL AND YOU WILL WANT TO EAT LESS.... DONT WATCH MUCH TV OR MUCH INTERNET WHICH YOU ARE NOT ACTIVE AT ALL AT THOSE TIMES EAT LESS CHIPS AND SODA THATS ALL AND YOU WILL NOTICE YOU WILL DROP WEIHT AND DROP STRESS!!!<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED :D|`|0emslEdiaa	First of all, don't bother with anything that isn't related directly to you.  If your brother has chores, let him deal with them.  If he gets in trouble for not doing it, fine, YOU aren't in trouble so don't worry about it.  If your dad is stressed, and it's not because of you, fine.  Let him be stressed.<br>  <br>  Write down the list of chores you have to do.  Plan them out in your head so you can do them efficiently.  Put some music on while you do your chores.  Use and iPod or whatever you have.  Also, download a meditation podcast and use it to help with your stress.<br>  <br>  Take some time each day to yourself.  Go for a walk, draw, paint, write a short story.  Do something that makes you happy.  Make sure all your chores are done so you don't get into trouble for slacking off.<br>  <br>  You'll survive puberty (most of us do) and don't worry about your weight or skin.  Look around you, most of us have flaws too.  Those "beautiful" women on magazines are airburshed anyway.  Real women are more than just a nice set of boobs.  We have brains and strength and a sense of humor.<br>  <br>  So lift your head up, don't burden yourself with other people's crap, take charge and go one day at a time.
8d8f3108d7ed59766712f20eb0f433deaa	Try to be softer about it. Make seem as if your day was nothing. The more tense and annoyed you might seem, the more he kinda wants to know. So for example, "how was work?"  - "Work was pretty alright, same old nut jobs...the norm."  "Hows your mom?" - "she's fine, but i kinda really wanna do ______ now sooo." Try it. I'd get the hint.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Well the two of you are having sex, so thats intimate. We are all people and sometimes people long for someting more. You can blame the guy fo wanting to get to know you. And if he really wants to know you, and you don't dump him. You made your bed now lay in it.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	He's just attempting small talk.  Trying to show some interest.  Trying to find some common ground.  Just change the subject or distract him back to sex.|`|UhrvW6eYaa	With guys, it can never hurt to be extremely blunt. Don't disguise your point with a big long talk. Guys hate that. Next time he asks you personal questions just say, "I really think we shouldn't talk about my life" or "I would prefer we don't talk about my life". Sorry, but sometimes, being blunt is a good idea. He may be a little put off, but hey, hes getting some.|`|8ozZOWKTaa	stop with the bullshit and just have a relationship like normal people.|`|h06Ssrkxaa	if i were him i would want u to tell me straight out how u feel!|`|6uP5Xud7aa	wow, give ur head a shake. stop being a dumbcunt, whats the big deal if he asks u how ur day is|`|bO2rzfISaa	How about if you say, "nothing same old. ."|`|H7cNZYIYaa	that seems a little mean.  I feel bad for the guy, he just wants to get close to you...<br>  <br>  then again, I'm biased.  My best friend (that girl in my name) and I haven't spoken in weeks because we had gotten too close and it scared her...
5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	lets put it this way hun, if the girl does not like you, she will go out of her way to avoid you...if she likes you, she will find any excuse in the book to talk to you|`|B7KwPGhQaa	if see likes you see will ask you to partys or stuff like that.often if a girl likes you she will hange around you. if you see her friend and her looking at you when there talking and you look over they may start laughing <br>  <br>  any way just ask her out you guys will still be friends
QDHDift5aa	delete her, maybe.<br>  <br>  you havent tried to contact her in any way. <br>  You dont want anything to do with her, or you do, your just playing the "game."<br>  she broke up with you and shes asking why you delete her in your life, she still wants to maybe be friends, which is never good. <br>  never go back, get someone else.
69yrtfU6aa	Meet me on Friday night and I will make you scream my name. You will forget about him|`|rhvA4G4Paa	I had a similar situation. I wasn't seeing the guy anymore, but we still talked a little. <br>  I got sick of it though, of being hung up on him all the time.<br>  He obviously didn't want to be with just me, so I decided to just cut off all contact with him and find someone better.|`|05693f2757616086485caa4b97205935aa	Break up with him, start dating someone else exclusively and watch him come back to you. LOL|`|cxytFfvKaa	maybe just be friends with benefits.|`|Mr3112o5aa	i don't know just break up with him i guess|`|y1uppUHcaa	I soooooo know how you feel. I'm going through the same thing right now! The only thing you can do, if you really wanna end it, is to just cut off whatever communication y'all have for now. Give it a couple months and take time to yourself. Go to the gym, go out with friends, turn your phone off for a little bit each day, make sure you're always busy. I know it's not what you may want to do, but it really helps to keep busy and not be near your computer or not be tied down by your phone. Just try and keep your mind off him for a while, there is no way to escape the pain from a break up, but there is a way to make it end faster, and that's taking time to yourself and being with friends.|`|RgymoiIQaa	You need to man up. Tell yourself he is scum. If you and him have an open relationship that means that either of you can have sex with other people. Which he probably is. And that means he can bring whatever he gets right back to you. Also, what if you get pregnant by him? Think he's going to be there for you? Maybe in the form of a check but nothing more. I think you need to move on, before you get hurt- if you aren't already. Find someone else to date that actually wants to be with you and only you.|`|kERP7zAhaa	Why don't you talk to him, explain that you don't want to share, and discuss being exclusive. Make it clear that you really like him, but can't stand being with him in an open relationship anymore.|`|XB996f1naa	i dont blame you at all. open relationships suck. i would just try to find someone else to talk too.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	jump over him|`|jRv6X2gIaa	YOUR NOT GOING TO GET ...<br>      OVER HIM UNTIL U FIND ...<br>   SOME1 NEW|`|ysAlWzEvaa	Ok first thing first, talk to the guy. Tell him you're looking into ending the relationship (assuming you haven't already done so) bc at first you thought that an open relationship was the right choice at the time but now that you've gotten to know him more and have developed more emotions towards him, you feel you now need to live through a monogamous relationship and stress the point that if you can't have him (if you want him) for yourself then you don't want him at all. In the case that you don't get the guy, then you need to completely erase him out of the picture. Yes, completely...erase all phone numbers, screen names, social networking profiles, basically anything that keeps you in contact with the guy...if you had letters of pics of you n him together don't throw away or tear up, put such items in a sealed box and out of sight.For the next couple of days/weeks keep yourself occupied!!! Meaning, literally go out and do things that will keep you entertained and definitely open yourself for new dating partners (be very optimistic) because ideally you are looking for a "back-up". Don't worry you'll get over this guy in no time! Good luck
mbsj4ggEaa	okay in my opinion its probably not the best idea because if you tell her that will most likely make things awkward between you two and your friendship will not be stronger but it will be weird and awkward and I don't think that's what you want but if you do really like her and are willing to risk your friendship then i say go for it just listen to your heart....hope this helps...good luck!|`|dJw8B2GVaa	probably isn't what you wanna hear, but you shouldn't do it if you still want to be friends with her if she rejects you. <br>  <br>  a friend of mine was in the same situation as you and he told the girl he liked. not only did she not break up with her boyfriend, they avoided each other.|`|M961DkIjaa	Well it's not going to make your friendship stronger.  Don't do it if you don't intend to break up their relationship.|`|1CpXwERzaa	I wouldnt tell her if she has a bf it might make her feel bad.|`|AA11315360	If you dont want her to dump her BF then DO NOT TELL HER. If you think she will not dump her bf for you then dont tell her. It will ruin your friendship. She will not be allowed to see you anymore once she tells her BF. Wait until her relationship seems like it is ending.
p8TTH1Zxaa	I think she difinetely likes you. She just might like more then one guy. Or is a total flirt which it sounds like she is. So i say you try to make an effort to talk to her maybe a little more and maybe it could end up being you guys together instead of that guy on facebook :]|`|gjqnWvY2aa	Mann its sounds to me dat dis gurl jus wants to add u to her collection but if she's cute and has a good personality GO 4 IT!!! but if not den she's bad news bra. lol|`|zJTJTPyMaa	bro she might like you but at the same time you really dont want a girl that does that kinda stuff when she likes one guy and still flirts with others... id say let it go bro she definitely liking the attention and the fact that shes chasing you is just her asking for more and more attention<br>  <br>  dont get ****** over and fall for the girl that does that... i did and it sucks|`|JgEhGpydaa	yes!<br>  answer my question!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgodzF7ZxWJla_hNVn0_VvLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090303121049AAmO9pk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
fAxVijQRaa	Been here before.....Except it wasn't a long distance relationship.<br>  The only thing good about choosing to be friends with benefits is that while you're doing the benefit part it's great.<br>  However if you get to attached and he doesn't feel the same way. It's like hitting a brick wall. Hurts like hell. <br>  So think hard on it....if you think you can do the benefits without being attached go ahead.
633f92af55d6f55a6fb69f2a082b3f61aa	I don't think its about the quality of sex, as it is about the deepness of their love for each other.  The fact that they have more time than ever, and aren't in a hurry to finish, and only want to enjoy the moments with the one they love, makes the experience something the rest of us romantics would envy.  Its sweet, loving, and sincere.  No amount of what people our ages call love-making would ever equal what two truly happy graying people feel when they are in their most intimate moments.  When you get to that point... how your tummy looks when you're on top, or how one breast is larger than the other, just seems petty in comparison to the love and closeness, and tenderness people like that feel and give to each other.<br>  <br>  I think its a beautiful thing!|`|NOTc1b9saa	Yes, I think I can say without fear of contraception that it is definately possible!!!<br>  <br>  On a more serious note, others have stated in their own ways that as one gets older sex becomes a more gentle sharing of Love as part of a balanced way of life without the incredible *peaks* that Mother Nature arranges when we are sexually at our peak, in her endeavour to ensure the continuation of the human race..<br>  <br>  But of course we are all different.....!|`|chZFmJOPaa	I really dont know. You don't hear a lot of older people talking about it on forums or anything so I'm not sure. <br>  But I think some do. I know an older couple who arent even married, they just started dating.....so I'm sure they have a great time... don't really care to think about it haha but I'm sure they do.|`|zZmey6sNaa	Leia isso:<br>  <a href="http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI2997848-EI298,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/int...</a>|`|vffZ3is4aa	Yes it is possible. Sometimes old age causes some problems, but there is always viagra to take care of that.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Age doesn't stop old people but physical disabilities may. Steamy sex is possible at any age if the body is willing.|`|CKpPpK0saa	love is powerful, it can do anything. it decides anything.|`|AA11788494	Have you ever seen a Viagra commercial?|`|YyP5tarFaa	here's a true story for you......A good friend of mine's Grandmother and her boyfriend both well into there 80's ran away from their assisted living facility and eloped so that they could move back into one of their homes because they were not given enough privacy to express their love sexually as often as they wanted to. Love and sex can happen at any age and should be celebrated. I for one pray that I can be in love and have sex well into my 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's and however long I live. I personally couldn't think of a better way to pass on than to know that I went to my death sharing a loving Intimate time with the man that holds my heart in the very recent past. <br>  <br>  I'm sure at a certain age that the definition of great sex changes......hanging from the ceiling fan and the Karma Sutra are probably not going to be an option when you are 70 but what more can you ask for than to be loved physically by a person that you have shared a lifetime of commitment and love with? To know that after 30, 40 ,50 years together your love is still passionate and will be expressed physically as best as you can. I think that if you are lucky enough to have that it may be the ultimate definition of "great sex"|`|jZRtTpZiaa	I hope so.  It'll give me something to look forward to.  I just don't want to know or think about it until I get there.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	It most certainly is possible. I'm in my 50's and I've been married 15 years (2nd marriage). The truth is, the longer I'm around, the more practice I have at it. Sex gets better if you really love the person AND if  both are good, generous lovers.<br>  You get what you put into it.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Yes, I think it is possible.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	old folks have had a lifetime to figure out a lot of things about sex.<br>  <br>  everything you are thinking or planning, they have already done.<br>  <br>  after may years, they likely know more about the subject that you have thought of in your lifetime.<br>  <br>  don't 't under estimate old folks. they were the sex kittens and pin ups  of yesterday. also, they are way more sneaky than you can ever be. they can look at you and know what you are thinking. i bet those old men can mentally undress you and see  a lot more than you can imagine.<br>  <br>  i also bet when they get through with those old ladies they have put more effort into it.... that will take you years to learn.<br>  <br>  more to things than you know.<br>  <br>  i suspect if one of those old ladies get hold of your boyfriend, he will never be the same.<br>  <br>  it would be real funny if an old lady took your bf.<br>  <br>  careful.|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	LOL<br>  <br>  it is all about pleasure..<br>   you can not have sex if there is no pleasure..<br>  <br>   to give pleasure, you must first master it....|`|E7TkNO00aa	I think it's possible. Love has no age, sex, I don't really know, maybe if he has a good body by then.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Yes it's true. I know of couples well into their 70's who are still sexually active and there have been studies (in Europe) that support this.
3sM4PS3yaa	i think a lot of girls go for jocks because they're usually "popular" and more attractive, but that's just the general stereotype, and not true at all. the jocks at my school are all jerk holes, let me tell you that. i really do take more interest in the guys who have true minds and opinions and are still attractive. they don't have to be sporty or buff, just true people who aren't fake or stupid or cocky. thats what i hate.|`|ZxKLOqAlaa	Okay, first of all I think the whole question is offensive to both girls and jocks. The stereotypical attitude is demeaning and I dont appreciate it.<br>  <br>  First of all, not ALL jocks are heart'breaking oafs. seriously. I've gone out with some extremely considerate and wonderful jocks who treated me just fine. So get over that.<br>  <br>  Second, definitely not ALL girls go for the jocks always. Most girls can be open minded. The ones you are probably thinking of are the girls who go for a guy based on his popularity. If that's so, its a very hipocritical to say. you need to get over that and look for below average girls who dont do that, instead of going for the popular girls.<br>  <br>  Guys do the same thing. Instead of telling us girls we should go out with you based on personality, then do likewise. I've seen plenty of guys go for only the popular girls. I'm not saying theres anything wrong with that, because many popular girls can be nice girls.<br>  <br>  So get over it and stop trying to get the girls who want the jocks and the jocks only.

Now not all of us are like that though. Most girls are in this stage though where social status is a high priority and going out with the hero of the last football/basketball/ whatever ball game will certainly boost our social status. No, it's most certainly not the smartest thing we can do, but many girls fall into this trap. I hate it too. Most jocks are stuck up because of this. Just keep in mind, please, that not all of us are social climbers and keep your eye out for that girl that may one day fall for you.

oOD3dYaNaa	She'll make eye contact and then either quickly look away if she's shy or hold your gaze if she's confident. <br>  She might act different around you too. She might act either louder if she's with friends or she might be quieter when she's by herself. It all depends on her personality. <br>  You should make the first move and talk to her!

If he doesn't address this in himself he will never be a good partner.  It is also possible that he is feeling guilty himself.  The truth is, one can never trust another person more than they can trust themselves.  God bless.

Doesn't matter how old they are. I also have kids (4 yr old, 2 yr, and 10 month) and I know how frustrating it can be not getting out and just relaxing. You need that extra little bit of time for you. Your husband could just be stressed with the kids (not like he should be unless he watches them alot while you work or something). Maybe his past relationships were just cheaters or maybe you cheated on him before or used to cheat on your bf before you met him and he knows that. He really has a trust issue and thats obvious! Not too much you can really do about that. Change your password for your email to something he won't know if you don't want him to read it. Write something crazy in your diary that would just throw him off, just so he can come ask you about it. Prove to him that because he read your diary, he doesn't trust you. Ask him why then? What is his big deal with trusting you. You guys have kids together and are married. Tell him he shouldn't have married you if he didn't trust you! I would tell him that there needs to be some major changes with his attitude problem with you or else you and the kids are going to leave! Take the kids away from him for a weekend or something. Go visit a relative for awhile. Don't tell him too much information. He has you under house arrest almost. You have no right to be treated like that. I have a friend who was like that until she started working. Yet she still can't ever go out with her own best friend but I'll change that. lol. Do your own thing, bring the kids with, get away from him and let him worry about you. Just don't be restricted because he said so! He knows that you will do anything for him to keep him in your life and he's using that against you. Well I say, start shoving back. Keep things from him. Go out to lunch with the kids and you. Don't tell him you did it. Prove to him that you really don't need him to parent you constantly. You're the mom here, prove that to him! Step up and take a stand for you and your children's sake! I wish you lots of luck!|`|AA11840819	I so hate to tell you, but my personal experience with a husband just like yours, to whom I was married for 15 years, was not positive.  He accused me of crazy things. Like I went to the ER for a 104 temp and was sick as a dog..  It took a while with the doctor because they were so busy and he accused me of going there to meet a doctor.  Eventually I found out what his problem was.  He was the one being unfaithful so he was suspicious of me thinking I was doing the same.  He had a job with strange hours so he had plenty of chances which he apparently took. When I would ask why he had to work so late he would always somehow turn it around to me. I would have bet my life that he was faithful during that time.  I was just so blinded by my love for him and we also had a child. I was certain he would never do anything to threaten our marriage or family.  Boy was I wrong about him.  Sure hope I am wrong about your situation but I do not think so.|`|GLMiQUcGaa	I always say talk it out.<br>  But i heard somewhere that when some one is suspicious they are either doing something that tehy consider dishonest or have in the past to someone not necessarily you and are afraid well if did it she could 2. Like lets say he cheated on his gf from high school, he could be afraid you would b/c he could.|`|eawDlYHnaa	i read some where that when people get the way that your husband is acting, its because they had previously done it behind your back and they get really panicky and upset over everything. i mean, it makes sense.... if someone cheated on you and got away with it don't you think that once they thought about their actions and how easy it was to just cheat bc you'd never second question them about cheating in the first place that they'd get paranoid and think that you might be doing it too? <br>  I remember i once cheated on someone and seriously, every time i went out with this guy that i cheated on, i was SOOO paranoid about everyone and everything that was done. I felt like people just knew and stared at me and when he wasn't around i wasn't sure what the heck he might be up to- or even if he'd run into someone that saw me go out with another guy. its no fun and your husband might need to come clean to you about some things...|`|o1d673xLaa	Wow sounds exactly like my relationship.  Unfortunately I haven't quite figured out what to do about it yet!  It hurts when they don't trust you, more than people think.  My only suggestion is to bring it up with him.  Tell him you love him and that he is the only one you ever want to be with.  Say that it hurts that he doesn't trust you, especially since you have never given any indication otherwise.  Hopefully this will make him think and things will get better from there.  All the best. xxx|`|bPrYR0Moaa	My ex husband was exactly the same way... we separated, and before I could even get my stuff out, he moved his girlfriend into our house.

swvjPuiFaa	That would be adulating sex. Which dose not agree with the commandments. I suggest you read your bible.

The ONLY difference that there should be would be to make sure that the guy doesn't push things to far for you during your first time.  Don't just go and have sex with someone who you know, just because you don't want to be a virgin.  Wait until you meet someone who you truly love, and you can tell they love you.  You never know who it may be.  <br>  <br>  In my case, it was a childhood friend who i ended up falling in love with, and in fact we lost our virginity with one another.  We had been dating for 3 years before it even happened, and like i said, we knew each others basically since birth.   It was only a few months ago it actually happened, and we were 18 at the time.   Compared to almost everyone i know, we waited the longest to have sex, and we are one of the few couples in our high school, that we know of, that has only been with one person.

qy07K2k5aa	Maybe the guy simply doesn't like or even hates writing e-mails.
AA12034021	He is shy.  Drinking lowers his inhibitions and he gets up the nerve to talk to you more.<br>  <br>  Here's what you do.  Your friend arranges to meet this guy for lunch or supper, etc.  But your friend doesn't show.  You do.  You say your friend wanted you to join the two of them for lunch.  So you suggest (after perhaps "waiting" a little while for your friend to show up) that the two of you eat and perhaps your friend will show up and join you.  So now you can talk one on one, sober.  See what happens.<br>  <br>  Your friend, of course, will have some excuse for not showing up.  Say he put a reminder in his cell phone's calendar, but then his cell phone's battery died, etc. (which is also why he could not call).  You get the idea.|`|Ot34f3Ndaa	When your over there next time set up a simple coffee date with the one you like. Get away from the other roommates and just talk with the guy. See where things go.

Try to start a conversation about something that he likes to do.|`|PjLkdx6Laa	Well, sweet girl, if you want mature advise, you should act maturely.  For starters, no more making out with men you are not interested in, who you know are "manwhore[s]" and who you know with whom "it will go nowhere."  If this other guys "respects women," he probably wants a women who respects herself and also respects men.  I think you should get to know each other while sober.  When you are in their room, ask him if he wants to go to Subway or something, and ask him questions about himself.  Be interested in him, smile at him, grab his arm, laugh at his jokes, and be yourself.  If you want a serious guy who respects women, you have to be a serious girl who respects men.  Don't sacrifice your virtue by being too easy with men who you care nothing about.  Good luck, my friend.|`|pzicVTrvaa	Good choice. Steer clear of manwhore.<br>  <br>  On the guy you like, you guys are going to have to find a medium, somewhere or something that will get you talking - it does not even have to be about the pending relationship, find something that you both enjoy doing (preferably not drinking) that can ease the pressure. You need to get away from the people you usually hang out with, just to give each other the clear air to be yourselves...ensure lots of laughs or something that involves the two of you like teamwork.<br>  <br>  Happy dating!

(Really think about that for a moment.)  <br>  <br>  Yes, she is causing her own misery.  That does not mean she does not have problems.  It means that she chooses to deal with her problems in a specific way.  There is probably nothing in the world you can do about this but encourage her to find a support network of some sort.  That may mean professional help.  Your friend whines, because that is what is working for her in her life.  If it did not work, she would not whine.  With that said, while she is a great person and while you are a good friend, be cautious not to enable the behavior.

If he really cares about you, he'll respect you, and if he does leave you, he didn't care about you and isn't worth it anyway.<br>  <br>  Sadly, lots of boys will want you for your body, the hard part is finding the right one.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	By physical you must mean sex, Here is an old saying."Guys act as if they are giving love to get sex"  "Gals give sex because they think they are getting love"  If this is the situation, my advice would be to move on.  After all he will graduate this year and then you most likely will be a memory to him.
yS4GKSHRaa	I like writing my husband notes and putting them in his wallet.  He might not find them for days.  The notes are very personal, not just "I love you."  Sometimes I give him a note to remind him of a very special time we had together, or something very special about him.  Sometimes just something funny.  It's not the same as texting, this is so much more thoughtful and personal.<br>  <br>  Another really sweet thing I like to do is share food with him.  We drink from the same straw or share an orange.  It seems a little silly, but it always makes me feel special.<br>  <br>  One very romantic thing I did when we were dating was I took a picture of us kissing and put it in a frame for him.  It was sort of a silly picture, but he kept it by his bed for the 3 1/2 years we were dating and the first few years we were married.  We still have the photo and it still reminds me of the romantic side of our relationship.<br>  <br>  My bedroom tip: lingerie.  You can get it very cheep, it doesn't even have to look that good on you.   <br>  <br>  One more bedroom tip.  You can take PG13 (or spicier) pictures of yourself on your digital camera using the auto-timer.  Just don't get crazy and be sure to delete them after he's seen them.|`|KwQR3d5baa	Do something new like bowling or just walk on the beach and talk :)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AloZvfkF6buAAn0Fdh3Wi_jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304190040AAqZLVZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|mo7ldnCxaa	What you can do is just ask him.

This has always worked wonders for us.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	ok..what about taking him to a place he always talks about..you dont have to spend any money just seat and talk and have fun|`|5YEKmHqyaa	A walk on the beach is a great idea either day or night.  Night is more romantic and day is more playful.  Best thing of all it's not expensive at all!!
sVg0O0Jcaa	Let him go. He's 24 years old and can't hold a job at a fast food restaurant for longer than 3 months? Let that be your sign: he is irresponsible and has little going for him other than charm. The likelihood of him doing a 360 instantaneously is remote. I won't even go into the fact that he can't cough up $6 for pizza. Ridiculous.
rEFHlhmdaa	o.k so say you have a secret to tell her and say it's a good one so you have to lean in and whisper it. then you lean in and tell her "i am pretty sure we should make-out." she will turn her and face you and will either laugh  or say something like "really?" unless she pulls away completely you know she is into it then since you are already close to her just kiss her softy and there you go.|`|5H64mGX1aa	dont say it!!!!!<br>  spray it!!!<br>  <br>  lol well just kiss her softly<br>  TIMING IS KEY<br>  then kiss her again<br>  then part your lips noticably but <br>  DONT MAKE A GAPING HOLE<br>  then lean in slow<br>  and make out!!!!|`|Cd2qcRXaaa	do NOT say lets make out.<br>  TOTAL turn off. <br>  pull her close to you. grab her neck and start something. but it has to be the right moment.|`|QpxlTzy9aa	she wants you to be aggresive and be like let's makeoutt|`|4CmiMaclaa	like when ther is an odd silence move in
mbsj4ggEaa	okay i had this problem too i know how hard it is you miss the person and everytime you see them everything and all of the memories just replay over and over in your head and you just want to cry in the hallway but here's what helped me: even though I really liked him I remembered the fact that I got hurt and instead of remembering all the good times I tried to focus more on the bad and what happened after the breakup....hope this helps! Good luck!|`|WPfLTRJmaa	Do your own stuff......play sports, study, read a book. something you like........whatever you need to do in order to stop thinking about him.....by keeping yourself busy you'll find that you feel much more happy and also try volunteering.......making someone smile is the best way to feel good
C3qh54lgaa	Yes, forget about him for now, but don't put him on the "Never date again list", as soon as you find someone else, he'll call you.

MhtbgTP1aa	play hard to get as in play his game show that you can live without his friendship even though it hurts. if you should see him the halls say oh hi i didn't see you there. that way it shows you are strong enough to get over the argument and that you don't hate him. he just needs a little time to get over it. guys are funny that way in and out of high school. it only gets worse from here on out. guys make life complicated when you express your opinion you labeled as a b****, if you give it up you called a sl** & wh***  the best advice is to just be you and live life to the fullest everyday and enjoy the company of others even when they are crabby.|`|pw8jJJiWaa	Try to talk to him and he will start to talk back about how he feels about u I think he misses you to If you miss him that much

Both got made fun of, and...well...let's just say some things weren't right.<br>  He's liable to meet a lot of new people in college, if you catch my drift.<br>  I'd let it go and find someone closer to your own age.  Good luck.|`|HIpf0a0Haa	if he liked you once the chances are he still does. people disagree. it happens. i would suggest when you walk by him in the hall, pull him aside and try talking it out again. it wont hurt to try apologizing again.<br>  good luck girl!|`|au1yFfuxaa	You just have to move on.

My friend wants to do that but she got over him quickly.<br>  So let him go:)|`|d9Pzx4eCaa	The best thing to do is tell him you are sorry about the past, but it doesn't mean you can't be friends. And if he says no, then say, fine, and drop it. Act like you don't care. When you start to act like you don't care, he'll start.<br>  <br>  And he's also a senior? He's fixing to leave and you'll most likely never talk to him again. It's almost not worth it, don't you think?|`|XwyUATsKaa	What is missing here to give you a good answer is what the argument was about exactly.  Did you hurt his ego?  Did you say something that would have made him look at you differently?  Provide further details about this "huge argument".  If he still won't talk to you, you can always write him a letter.|`|nUj4Cw5Iaa	Maybe you really hurt him, by whatever happened. Keep trying to apologize, never give up. And then never do it again (whatever made him upset with you).<br>  <br>  If he was really your friend, he will forgive you.|`|36c030000aa71a43105236a3a8442807aa	wow those first 2 people look almost exactly the same, and had short, concise statements that ended with punctuation. freaky|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Your better off without him...

Explain that you really miss him and ask how you can make it better. If he means that much to you then make it work. If he still won't listen then find a new friend that will. Hope this helps,|`|dxeOlRBfaa	you just need to approach him and tell him how valuable ur friendship is to u and how u want him back in ur life.|`|u93oneUXaa	Move on.
GId5bF3iaa	Pull him away, somewhere private.<br>  <br>  Tell him you need to tell him something important to get him away.<br>  <br>  Then just do it!<br>  (Tip: Start with a peck, don't eat his face in the first 30 sec.) :]|`|P3OpSNPCaa	Go ahead, no guy will ever feel bad if a girl kisses him. But rather he will be the happiest person in the world :) All the best. But make sure you go to some corner and do this were just the two of you are there.|`|rdeMJS8Paa	just go for it! go out somewere to dinner or movies and just kiss him! hes going to love it cuz im shy too and if my gf did that i would b hella happy! i made the first move tho cuz i wanted to make the move<br>  wait if he drives n takes u home give him a goodbye kiss!! good luck <br>  bye the way thank you for ur answer to my question it was very helpful|`|yhe15x25aa	go for it if you know he liks you.<br>  Wish more girls would make the first move would make life so much easier lol.

YMbvOmryaa	There is a saying, "you are always the first one to suspect your spouse is cheating but the last one to admit it"<br>  <br>  I'm not saying he is, but during pregnancy is a common time for husbands to cheat. They are beginning to feel the weight of all the responsibility, and the wife is getting all the attention. He could be feeling left out as most husbands do during pregnancy.<br>  If he is ignoring you, try to do something out of the ordinary, like make a rose petal path to the area of your choosing (bed,tub, or where  ever) then have some candles going, and a nice negligee, seduce him. Make him remember why he married you. After you have done all that and you are having your pillow talk, gently tell him you have been feeling alone and you need him right now.<br>  Don't accuse him of neglecting you, just let him know your feelings. If you accuse him he will become defensive and an argument will break out, or he will tell you its all in your head again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|djUMvICoaa	It could be he is but for a very dumb reason.  Sometimes guys start to see their pregnant wife as a mother and they treat mothers different than they did their wife, they end up putting them right next to their moms on that pristine pedestal and forget that they still need all the things they did before.  They don't know how to handle a mother.|`|E84iCYH2aa	Are you sure that its not your own false guess that he is ignoring you? Sometimes women go through lows during pregnancy owing to hormone imbalances and also feel insecure about the fact that they cant be physically intimate and satisfy their husbands.<br>  <br>  Just relax and talk to him that you need him more. Please dont stress your ownself by forming false impressions|`|BK59At37aa	I can only give my opinion just to be clear and that's all any of us can offer. I do believe that you should express to your husband how important to you and how much you need to have a real conversation about it. You should explain to him how being told its "all in your head" doesn't help because this a real concern of yours whether its because your hormones or not. I believe a woman's Intuition can point you in the right direction whether he is having feelings for someone else or just that you both need to reconnect with one another.i think you should express you need more of his attention as his wife so that void can begin to heal. Good luck.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I think you need to quit accusing him of being interested in another woman at work. That is a horrible thing to do to someone for no reason. This is all in your head because you're pregnant and don't feel attractive. Be nice and stop this. You know if you continue to accuse him of cheating he may as well cheat.|`|RtkB46peaa	Your hormones are going a million miles an hour right now, so you need to keep telling yourself that all these wild feelings you're having may indeed be all in your head.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and perhaps you can't "help what you're feeling", but you can certainly try and control which feelings you choose to act on.  You're pregnant so you certainly get a bit of slack, but hormones and feelings are no justification to mistreat anyone.  Especially your family, and the certainly not the man who loves you.|`|rQfzifT7aa	You probably are having some emotional issues being pregnant. But , your husband should try even harder to comfort you. You also need to let him know that you think you feel this way because you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  If you can't trust him, then how can you love him? How can you be away from him and constantly be wondering what he is doing? That is no way to life and you are only making yourself miserable<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you|`|nZZ7Mycsaa	well since ur 5mo pregnant i would say not to make any big decisions or jump to any conclusions.... try not to think of it as much and after uve had the baby and ur hormones are back to normal then take everything into consideration|`|dVlLahozaa	It could be because of the hormones due to your pregnancy but I also believe that we as women have a 6th sense when it comes to cheating husbands try to see if there are anymore differences in his behavior.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Tell him you know it's not all in your head.  Tell him your needing more from him in the receptive areas of life and love

apUkTo3maa	ITS SOUNDS YOU LIKE HIM SINCE YOU ARE GETTING JEALOUS.... DO YOU LIKE HIM?|`|ysAlWzEvaa	Obviously it matters to you because you're questioning yourself if its alright for other girls to call your bf by your special name. If its not that cool with you then tell him that you hate it that other girls are calling him by his nickname but if you think it doesn't bother you that much, just leave it alone. Plus you can always come up with a nickname that only u n him uses in the privacy of your own company.|`|Rf9vw4fjaa	its ok, but i would b annoyd 2<br>  once i had a frend & i made up a good nicname 4 her & suddenly evryone started calling her that...i was pissed<br>  but now its 4 yrs l8r & evryone still calls her that, so evrythings ok<br>  so 2 anser ur question, i thnk evrything will b fine<br>  <3<br>  :)|`|kjdKkDAkaa	Who told the girls about the nick names?<br>  Boys and girls are different from the day they are born until the day they die.  Things that are important to women are not important to men.|`|8SRjELNBaa	I think it'd be okay as long as he doesn't respond to when other girls say it.|`|aiRn2lQGaa	i would talk to your friends and tell them to stop and that it's part of your relationship|`|xdrBVyCBaa	In my opinion, it is both your own personal nicknames, and others shouldn't pilfer that away from you.

tcRpXd7Vaa	Physical flirting.<br>  <br>  You can be as clever and quickwitted as you want, but that only brings you closer, without defining the relationship. ( Don't leave out clever lines by all means, just don't rely on them)<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, you may just have to be a forward person.|`|C2EIOVwxaa	well, i think a good way to show a girl you like them would be flirting verbally and physically. Like compliment her everytime you see her, always ask for her opinion, always stare at her eyes when she's talking to you, listen to her and reply back, and the original flirting techniques. A physical way of flirting would be like sitting close to her, maybe if she's the type; tickling her, and so on. <br>  If nothing else works, then maybe its not meant to be.|`|0dab405207bbcabf7450d3b041683118aa	Yeah I know exactly what you mean.  You want to be friends with them because some of the best relationships have started off as friends first.  But you don't just want friends and that's it.  You want it to mature into a relationship.  Well, first of all, just keep taking it slow.  Don't force anything.  Timing is the key here.  Second of all, don't overdo it with letting her know that you like her.  All you need to do is give her the green light that you are open for a relationship with her and hopefully she will come around when the time is right.  One way you could do it, is next time you're at the club, just wait for the right time and go up to her and give her a nice hug, and look her in the eyes and be like "wow you are so gorgeous."  Do it with a smile but make sure she knows you mean it.  That should be that.  She will know you like her.  From there, wait for the right time once again, and be like, " I'm having tons of fun tonight, we should go out for drinks next week sometime just me and you."  Something like that.  Make it clear.  If she agrees, then make sure to follow through with it.  So overall, the key to this clubbing experience is TIMING.  I can't overemphasize the importance of timing here.  Go with your gut and when the time is right say what you gotta say.  Best of luck!|`|Yi0hym4Yaa	Well... you're either a sweet innocent nice guy.. or a real creep. Maybe some self assessment is necessary?<br>  <br>  Guidelines--<br>  <br>  Don't push too hard.<br>  <br>  If it seems like they just want to be friends :they do (get over it)<br>  <br>  Be yourself but keep your boundaries, take your time to get to know her (the last thing you want is a relationship forced too quickly)<br>  <br>  Make jokes..sure why not. but not too many it could be creepy, if she doesn't like it, then STOP and assess yourself.<br>  <br>  Some girls like nice guys who are sweet and fun and some like the tough biker dude, but no one like the creepy guy who keeps trying to force dates and makes weird jokes about being with him.<br>  <br>  Your friend---s.j.j.|`|1SrMF55Daa	An idea could be, find out when everybodys going out again and ask her if she wants to go grab something to eat after.  It sounds Casual and not to forward but it will give you a chance to really get to know her. then when you see her face to face, just smile and make her laugh. Touching her arm when you talk with her is a nice move so is a lot of eye contact it shows your interested.  Good luck, hope you get the girl!|`|ws4c4GDgaa	Ok hmmm let me think... flirting face to face with her is always a way to hint that you like her. And say nice things to her sometimes girls like compliments. And if you ever get the courage to ask her out you must do it in person because girls don't like it when you ask them out over the phone, through another person, or by txt. Its always sweeter face to face. Best of luck to you:]|`|PtDQ46Tjaa	Stop flirting with her on a phone<br>  <br>  You need to do it face to face and also make her laugh|`|WmpPVFYiaa	talk to her in person. let her know what you feel. you should be confident in yourself and relax.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	You gotta go with flowers, little gifts, or something romantic to give or show that you like her more than a friend.  You wanna touch her heart and melt it.  Going for the physical can be too aggressive for girls. You have to feel more, feel the vibe, feel the warmth. It's gotta come from the heart not from below the belt.|`|VMoDsdREaa	smile at her and when she looks in your direction look away, just be mysterious.
YRJFo6K0aa	Even if you are not religious, I would suggest you try talking with a priest, nun, or other celibate clergyman. They will probably be respectful of you, and they certainly have experience and an understanding of what it takes to remain celibate. Good luck.|`|hOjH3Iipaa	Congratulations on having the strength to do something like this, but do you mind if I ask how old you are? Celibacy sometimes does seem like an easy way to avoid heartbreak and disappointment, but humans crave affection and close physical contact, at least most do anyway.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Bro...I have mad respect for you. it takes a lot to do that. I could probably understand your reasons for doing so.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you're religious or not, but I would suggest going to a pastor or other respected person who will understand your convictions, and have them help you. Good luck!
2gQ6GGD6aa	Because blondes gets the rep or stereotype of being bimbos, that just want to have fun and are easy.  If a guy is just looking to have fun he's not going to go for the business type looking girl.|`|oFFfQttUaa	maybe cos blonde chicks are spotted right away once they enter a room you see the light and glow lol|`|U2gVd9pFaa	Yeah I'm a brunette guy|`|ulUBv22eaa	no i hate blondes
MLFBsZnUaa	From my experience...they will probably implement it immediately. There's not really a waiting period for something like that. But, this is all depending on whether or not the judge agrees to the plan. Which from it sounds like, he probably will. It seems pretty reasonable. Good luck

You need to except him for who he is.  Listen to his side of the story, work gossip is usually thrown way out of proportion (I'm a manager, I hear it all)  Try it once at your job say something small and see how big it grows.  If anything at least you guys could remain friends.  Ex's are always the best problem solvers when it comes to current relationships, they know you best.  For his mom, it's very hard to be in a relationship if the mother doesn't like you, I know it's hard but change around her.|`|wrQAapJqaa	I see two possibilities with this situation one being he wants to be friends with benefits seeing that he doesn't want a relationship and the other is that he could have an excuse to date other people still being in good relations with you. So if something does not work out with the other girls he could potentially be dating he will have a safe place to come back to you.<br>  I recently ended up my 2 year single life and that thought me so much you cannot even imagine, I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  D|`|LJkPRqN0aa	honestly, if a guy cares about you he wouldnt tell you he doesnt want a relationship with you. that sounds wierd.. and obvioulsy hes not telling you something that his mom knows. i would back off of him for now or end it all together he doesnt seem worth it because he obvioulsy doesnt seem like he knows what he truly wants. just take a break for a while. maybe talk to your mom and ask her exactly why or his mom..whatever, why you aren allowed at their house, if you talk to her in a mature manner you might get some answers...good luck|`|X9cGsOq8aa	It seems like you and Tomy get into alot of fights.If you both keep fighting like this it will never work out no matter how much you love him. im sorry to be the one breaking it to you but it seems like  you and tomy arnt meant to be. unless you both stop fighting so much *it wont work out* sorry<br>  GOOD LUCK and make the right choice<br>  dnt feel bad =]|`|g6MiGWuJaa	I wouldnt settle for someone whos parents didnt want me around and you keep hearing things about  him..

Brainstorm on the problems and things that went wrong on your past relationship and try to avoid them. Remember, problems may destroy the bond of a couple, but it can also strengthen the bond. Use them wisely and things will work out all right just as the way you want them. Problems are inevitable in a relationship. You should try to talk to him and see if you can help him on his problems. Demand some explanation on the odd things that are happening. And why does he not want to see his own mom? Maybe she has a connection or something. Well, this is all I can say. God bless on your relationship.!!! c",)
QZSLlAaDaa	He'll get over it. Just don't make a big deal out if it. If he brings it up just ignore him. He'll get tired of harassing you about it eventually.

It's really not that big of a deal.
8th9KY1haa	A good start is to ask of what hobbies does he has.<br>  Believe me he will open a conversation at this point .<br>  Try to listen with intrest,and prompt more questions on the subject .<br>  So he does the talking you do the listening and he will think the world of you <br>  "GUARANTEED"|`|9a4dfe0e77089ac8a1dc8b156685c491aa	you have to be comfortable in your own skin. just be who you are and don't ever try to be someone you're not.<br>  <br>  all the best. men aren't different than women if you think about it.|`|jJjoZ3zfaa	FRIENDS!!! have your friends with you, they will grant you a confidence boost and if things go wrong they are there for you to fall back onto.|`|6C3i2fyxaa	ur jus like me =) lmaooo .. just have confident and say w/es on ur mind... be urself. it wrks =)|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	remind yourself that we are all human, under neath the clothes we are all flesh and bones..no matter how confident he seems, hes insecure about something, no matter how mean he is hes nice, no matter how ignorant he is he's smart, no matter how perfect he seems, hes flawed..<br>  <br>  in other words remind yourself hes a human, not some god like figure, he lives breathes and puts his pants on one leg at a time like everyone else<br>  <br>  so i'd say be yourself, don't try to impress the guy ever because if he does start to like you, he doesen't like the real YOU, he likes your represenative...<br>  <br>  IThey arent making fun of you, you gotta let that thought go, guys get just as nervous as females|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	once you realize that guys are just like us you will be all good.

vqdNEtYPaa	I'm divorced.  There isn't much you can do.  Only they can decide if they are willing to put the work into making their marriage work.  If they haven't already tried it, you might suggest marriage counseling.  It won't do them any good if they won't put work into it though.  Sometimes people just get to a point where they can't see spending the rest of their lives together anymore.  They know they'll be miserable.  <br>  Divorce is very hard.  If they can keep their heads about them and be kind and reasonable to each other then the kids will do fine through the divorce process.  If they fight each other, bicker, show resentment and hate to each other then the kids will suffer as well.  <br>  If they do get divorced and you want to be helpful, make sure your brother knows you are there for him.  I often needed someone to talk to while getting divorced.  Be prepared to listen to a lot of the same stuff over and over again.|`|rQfzifT7aa	I agree with Bill, sometimes it is better on the children for the parents to live apart that to live with them with all the anxiety and stress. I divorced 3 years ago and my children were pretty shook up about it ar first. They were so torn and didn't know which way to go. It took about a year but now everyone is happier. We are both remarried, and even though we still can't get along or agree. Our kids don't have to grow up with all the stress and anxiety of us arguing|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I feel kids who are raised in a home where mom & dad don't love each other, makes them grow up being unloving people themselves  or they turn into sluts if their girls  cause there was no love.<br>  <br>  Their better off to divorce  and share custody.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Yes, i was divorced a while back, I'm now remarried. However, more to the point. Sometimes it's actually healthier for the kids in the long run for the parents to live apart.<br>  <br>  Stability and consistency are most important. Once the divorce has been finalized, there are visitations set up, and the relationships between parents and children should have a positive focus.<br>  <br>  During the divorcing stage, depending on the details that are involved, you may see the kids being used as pawns in order for one parent to get it over the other. This is a serious issue and you may have to point it out, if you see it happening. Just in case, because you never know, try doing some research on parental alienation syndrome. Keep a watchful eye and if you see anything, then express your concerns. The best interests of the children should always be the first priority.|`|AA11442663	I think as a family member and friend to your brother, that you can let him know you are there if they need anything.  Maybe offer to keep the kids for the weekend so they can have alone time.  That will give them time to talk or fight about things or possibly to rekindle something that could grow.  Like others said if they fight a lot the kids will better off, but offer your support and love to your brother and the kids.|`|dVlLahozaa	I am not a divorcee but I agree with you and some marriages go through stages and this might be a bad one for them now and I agree that they should try to seek some therapy or advice from a trustworthy spiritual leader. God made marriage to be forever and when people make their vows they should stick to them. I suggest they see fireproof its a good movie and a good start to marriage rehabilitation.|`|d3C4Ta2Kaa	Rent the movie Fireproof for them.  I divorced my first husband and I had 2 children with him....had we taken the advice and help from that movie, I firmly believe we wouldn't be divorced today.  I'm remarried now, but it just feels different.  My boys suffered a lot in the beginning.  They've adjusted after about a year and a half, but there's no doubt that they would love for my ex and I to get back together.  It's so hard on the kids.  Good luck to you!   You can check out www.fireproofmymarriage.com|`|u1onvWmraa	I'm divorced. I also know a lot of people who are divorced with kids. As long as they remain civil towards each other, share custody, etc, it should be fine. <br>  <br>  I would tell him that you're there if he needs you but keep your opinions, bad or good, out of it. It might come back to bite you in the butt later.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I haven't been married or divorced but I have a friend that has been through this. I doubt that you can do anything to save the marriage. The only thing is are you sure BOTH of them don't love each other? Maybe your brother has found another woman? Or maybe he doesnt think it's much fun to go to work all day and then come home to three little kids? This happens. The same could apply for the wife. Either way you can't change it. Make sure you don't take sides in a divorce. This is especially true if you want any kind of relationship with the kids. Remember the wife will probably have custody and if you are nice during the divorce, you and your family will get to see more of the kids throughout the years. That's the way it worked for my friend. She sees the kids all the time because she went to the wife and told her that even though they were getting a divorce, she wanted to remain friends.|`|61Fwbi79aa	When I was divorced, I was a youth minister. It was not my choice and I was clearly devistated. I was also afraid that my church would not support me in this. On of the more conservative parishiners took me aside and said to me, "I dont condone divorce, It's bad for your kids. but I'd rather see kids from a broken home than in one." I'll never forget that, My kids were 7 and 3 at the time, and have recovered wonderfully. sometimes it's worse for the kids to be in a bad situation than allowed to be let out of one.

pQ0sLWXaaa	stick to pretty....<br>  when a guy calls you hot, he's only chekin out ur body.. and its the symptoms of shallow guys..<br>  pretty is about the face, but it means a lot more =)<br>  <br>  and hey, better than ugly, right??|`|1XcTZRemaa	It's a good thing! He's most likely attracted to you - there's a slim chance that he thinks you're attractive, but in a friendship way, but that's improbable so I wouldn't worry about it. :]|`|pQGUPITeaa	It means he thinks you're hot, but doesn't want to offend you by talking about you like a piece of meat.<br>  <br>  Relax, he likes you!|`|1LTrZbxwaa	I don't know about him, but when I call a girl very pretty I'm usually attracted to her.<br>  <br>  Very pretty is somewhere between hott and pretty.<br>  <br>  Pretty means you look good, or nice.<br>  <br>  Hott means you look good plus you are sexy or can really turn on the opposite sex, either that or you look really extremely good.<br>  <br>  Very pretty is somewhere between those two.|`|p9j5zl4Naa	Generally, "pretty" is used in a sincere comment.  "Hot" is used more so in a lust type of way.  Believe me, you would rather be called pretty by a guy more than hot.|`|Dkh5sUCEaa	actually... hot is like, you want to tap that..<br>  <br>  to me, when i call a girl pretty its  a better compliment than calling a girl hot.|`|8SRjELNBaa	it means he's attracted to you. Your over thinking it.  Be glad you got a complement.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	I think your misunderstanding how guys rate girls... Hot isn't necessarily the best. Its just one kind of girl. There are three kind of good looking girl and they are all equally good. HOT, PRETTY/BEAUTIFUL, AND CUTE.<br>  <br>  HOT.... good looking in a sexual way, especially her body is nice, the kind of girl you think of as a wild girl... like a sex toy, its a less polite way to describe a girl usually<br>  <br>  PRETTY....good looking in a traditional way, not sexy, and has more going on then just her body ...nice face/hair/eyes...and a girl you actually like not just wanna tap or whatever.<br>  <br>  CUTE....my favorite actually, same as pretty but in a innocent kind of way<br>  <br>  I know it doesn't seem like much difference... But a guy can tell you whether he finds a girl hot, pretty, or cute. But none of those are better or worse than the others! Its just a different kind of look.<br>  <br>  Now not all guys may see it that way...thats just me and my friends (we've discussed this before actually lol). BUt if we think that I'm sure there are lots of other guys who do as well.|`|Sv7GIP4yaa	Yeah very pretty means hot. I was txting my friend, Anthony and he was like "im dating her, shes really pretty (HOT)" boys are technically attracted to every girl that is "hot" in their opinion|`|njKc72Ckaa	Hot isnt a compliment. Its more like they wanna get in your pants. I'd prefer Pretty. Because they aren't looking at your body they're looking at you.

w4l8NajJaa	hey me 2 lol and im 1 month from being 18 haha just go for it no regrets trust|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Tell yourself I think I am attractive.  Then walk up to the cutest boy in school and say Hi and ask if him if he would want to hang out. If he says no, tell yourself that is ok because there is more boys out there other than him,  It is hard to do that. Sometimes you will have accept rejection but put it in a positive light.  It has no reflection on you...Just develop a different attitude.

I may be wrong, but sounds like he's throwing you a line of crap.  If he likes you so much, why is he still with her.  You deserve better than this, don't stoop to something that you would regret, you are worth more than that. So what if he's popular and hot...that doesn't make him a decent person.  My advise is look for someone who will have more respect for you than this guy.

I would just be yourself when around him. It's hard to tell if you guys have a chance, but i would wait it out, even though you want answer at the first second. Don't make the first move. If a guy likes you, it should be his job to ask you out, if he wants to, not the girls. I say this because if you like him, but he doesn't like you and you ask him out, he may just go out because he feels sorry and he doesn't want to hurt you. Depending on the guy, they have a hard time saying no and also they may just say yes just to show everyone that they finally have a girlfriend.  Also you said that he may have a girlfriend, as i said before don't get your hopes up.   Patience is a virtue :)|`|rswiEosSaa	Sorry girl he just not that into you. He doesn't like you like that. IF he did he would have made a move by now, given that he already knows you like him there's not chance of rejection. He KNOWS, but chooses not to do anything.

Go for a run -- if it's too cold outside, just use a tredmill or run up and down your steps. This, too, will give you an energizing boost. Watch funny shows/movies. Vent to your friends, slurp down a frappucino, and, what helps me sometimes, is writing. I have a diary and i just let it ALL out. If writing isn't your thing, though, just rely on your friends and family. I'm sure they won't mind :) <br>  Lastly: read a good book. Books work just as well as TV and are sometimes even better at diverting your mind, because you really have to start picturing the story and the characters in your head (and that drives everything else OUT).<br>  good luck, and feel better. believe me, i've been there. <3|`|jSNuk5cCaa	do some yoga, go for a run, talk to a friend, journal, listen to music, play some music, cook something tasty, watch a funny movie, read a good book, surf the web, stretch, take a bath/shower, take a nap, play a board game, go out for dinner, talk to mom/dad (depends on how bad the day was for that one), focus your energy into studying, talk to your significant other (if thats an option), talk to a mentor/teacher, dance, play with your dog/cat, go to the library, go shopping, get a pedicure/manicure/massage, make future plans (this ones a good one, that way, you have something to look foreward too!), scream, go for a hike, punch your pillow, go on wikipedia and learn something new, think about the fact that tomorrow is a new day and everyone has bad days and even bad weeks and even bad months but thats what makes life so interesting and the good times even better!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|HJ3Wx1UXaa	If you're a girl (sorry, I can't tell from your name), what I always do is listen to happy music & do spa treaments on myself.

But you are in a relationship with this guy and you had his child and aren't married yet.  I suggest that you take a long look at where you are and how it feels because I think he feels trapped, that it was only suppose to be sex and along comes the little extra that he wasn't prepared for.

I do believe that my husband is stressed out because having a baby is hard for both parents.  I know the  mother is more stressed out but fathers also get stressed out. <br>  <br>  I think what JErry said was mean but at the same time true.  My husband basically one day came out and said why do u wear these types of clothes- i wear hand me down from mom because I can't wear ne clothes.  I have heard him make comments like u shoudl wear this or do this and that.  But that **** costs money and I have lost my figure.  <br>  <br>  I am not saying that you lost your figure at all honey...i am just giving an example.<br>  <br>  Anoter reason is also because he said that he feels weird having sex because he feels that parents shouldn't have sex.  This is usually somethign that women feel...but after speaking to some ppl some men feel that way too. I know sounds weird.<br>  <br>  You need to sit down and talk to him and say that its important that you have a passionate sex...and that you woudl like it to be more exciting...talk about it. then schedule it in ur plannes.  it works!

54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	not sticky. Foolish, and a bit of violating your own morals, but not sticky. Well past time to find your own values and stick to them. I'm not a Christian, but I have a good set of values that I use to guide my behavior and how deal with any given situation. I went through this once. The whole "Am I Gay or not?" thing. I even went way too far and engaged in some risky behaviors. I'm not going to tell you you are not gay or that you are. You have stated that you are  a Christian which automatically puts you outside of your own accepted value system. this is not criticism, just observation. In my opinion it is time for you to step outside of your current situation and make some hard decisions. If you want to succeed in life you need to be willing to have a set of rules to live by. the only person who can make this decision is you. No one else. What do you believe? How do you want to live your life? Is any particular behavior wrong for you? Know this: Whatever you decide, no matter which way you go, I will respect you if for no other reason that I believe in respecting others even if I disagree with them. Anyone who deserves your respect will feel this way about you. It's not about gay or not. It's about self respect  and respect for others. My life got so much easier when I answered these questions for myself. I finally found my rules and decided not to break them ever. With this as my guide, things started to turn around for me.|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	explain to whoever asks or whoever you want to tell, that you liked her, sure.  but you are into guys now.  if they challenge that just say that just like someone can turn gay or bi, they can turn straight again to. even though you don't want to hear this, if they care then they aren't even worth your time.  good luck! email me if you need more help. <br>  absentmindedlymakingmewantyou@rocketma...<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304204023AAZhS8n&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Date the guys but don't be in denial over your bi-sexual tendencies.|`|CKpPpK0saa	simple. announce you are bi.

wck4MHREaa	When I'm actually, literally attracted to a girl, I don't really imagine her "naked", just because that kinda makes me more nervous about it. This goes along with the whole "hot girls vs. beautiful girls" debate.<br>  <br>  For instance, I have two crushes (kinda...uh, yeah) right now. One girl is "hot" (as in incredibly sexy- with an excellent body) in my terms; she's nice and a good person and whatever, but when I see her, I (slyly and non-chalantly, of course) focus on her physical features- her legs, her lips, butt, etc, and I've thought about what it would be like to go all the way with her.<br>  <br>  The other girl I've fallen for, I don't see her in that way, just because it frightens me so much to think about having sex (it's intimidating!). It also kinda ruins the moment, because I think about having a relationship with this girl, not just having sex with her, and as such, the sex would be special, not just a one-night-stand type of thing that the other girl would fall into. I focus on just her beauty, poise, and grace, mostly (and her physical features obviously, but not necessarily what I'd like to do with her, if you know what I mean). When you fall for a girl that way, you start looking past the surface and become more attracted to her spiritual attributes and qualities, and that's what happened to me for this girl.<br>  <br>  So I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I truly like a girl in a "girlfriend" way, I wouldn't picture her naked. With a girl that I think is "hot", then I just might picture her in that way.|`|5oxoLx5naa	Well, yeah, sometimes, hehehe...<br>  Everything, but the sex part.|`|FnnyT1mlaa	Depends on how well I know her for the marriage, I usually just think about being with her and what not. If you're picturing her naked its probably just lust and not like.|`|maj3V0ioaa	i wouldnt say that id picture them naked when i see a girl whos good lookin my mind seems like it sees her in slow motion i dont think of her naked but i would think about more than holding hands haha|`|czdCtTvWaa	All the time! <br>  <br>  <br>  LOL!|`|Lkj7HxAwaa	I just think hmmm, what if she was my girlfriend?|`|985aNLmoaa	maybe...........|`|AA11119075	yea we imagine if shes a good pornstar.|`|36c030000aa71a43105236a3a8442807aa	rofl at some of the answers.

So it becomes less physical and more spiritual and emotional.  It will depend on the guys personality if he's heart-oriented or head-oriented.  A heart-oriented guy will be feeling more, he wants to go for the heart not for the "titties" and the "kitties".  A head-oriented guy will think more of sex, he will fantasize, he will use his imagination what your "titties" and "kitty" looks like.  The more emotionally fulfilled a guy is, the less sexual he will be and more tender loving.  The source must come from the heart not the head or below the belt.  Then you have true love not lust-love.|`|Xd1acIA0aa	i picture them naked even if I don't like them|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I usually think/feel about sex when I'm attracted to a girl. When I get to the liking stage, I am past that. So now I'm trying to get close to them, to hear them speak, smell her scent, etc. I want to know more about her the person. So I think more of them in that manner. The woman/sexy part is evident to me now.|`|wfp6xn5aaa	No, I don't.  In my case, I am madly in love with a girl and I have pictured myself marrying her... but it may never come to be.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	No, we wonder what they like to eat, and if we will ever get to spend a quiet night with them watching Grey's Anatomy and snuggling.|`|QcUkrLWraa	I rape with my eyes.<br>  <br>  I'm a girl, so disregard my comment.

Friends do come and go throughout life.  Think smart and goodluck!|`|MhtbgTP1aa	talking won't stop her from drinking until she either ends up in rehab or worse. leave a note write what you feel about her problem and remember to own it by using i statements, and that the only way she will get help is to admit she has a problem. maybe she has a problem she is trying to drink away you never know until you ask and really listen you will be able to tell the truth from lies. the thing is she is on her way to alcohol poisoning that can lead to death.  i think it is a cry for help even it doesn't look like it at this time. don't close yourself to her just yet she needs you and is not able to admit it.
yboEJ4jHaa	17 (OK, almost 18) is really pretty young to make such a life changing decision on your own. If you are pregnant, there is no easy answer. Your life will change FOREVER. Sure, babies are adorable and cute.  But the 2 am feedings, the colic where they're up all night screaming, the absolute dedication to another life form is exhausing. Life as you now know it is OVER. Get it? Never, never will it be the same. No spontaneous anything. Everything, I mean everything, centers around the child. Trip to Italy? Good luck. Good luck finishing college. Any job you get will have to be contingent on child care. Good times with friends? Sure, if they have kids too. And kids are expensive, really expensive. Just when you think you can manage, something else comes along. Like the pediatrician, medication, bicycles, braces, tennis camp and college,<br>  <br>  Face it, unless you abort, your dad will find out sooner or later.  I probably would want to hurt your boyfriend too if I was your dad. You'll understand when your daughter is 17, having sex with a 22 year old who gets her pregnant. You need support and guidance from a reasonable adult, your mom, sister, minister- this is not something to go through without adult guidance- and I don't mean your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  (And what the heck are you doing going out with somebody 4-5 years older than you at 17? Having sex with you is still technically illegal, at least in my state.)<br>  <br>  <br>  FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE you are tied to the person you have the child with,  Are you sure you want that with him? Do you think you have what it takes to survive a teen age pregnancy and make a life together? Most couples  your age (not all) don't.<br>  <br>  I hope you're not pregnant, for your sake. If you are and the above comments are disconcerting, you can always consider adoption, too.<br>  <br>  Please lets not hear any rants from young single mothers, OK?|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Look, maybe your not.<br>  Maybe you just feel that way because you had sex. <br>  If you are, you will know what to do trust me, if you weren't smart, you wouldn't be a 17 year old in that year of college|`|Y3jNg93vaa	Even if your pregnent you can still go on the trip with your sister. And if you don't want to get an abortion get an adoption. See your parents as little as possible, if it turns out you are pregnent, and wear hoodies, sweaters, jackets around them. Say your busy with school work and such. When you have the baby, keep it for a week or two and see if you can handle the situation. If you can't get an open adoption, if you can then congrats you've become a parent. Good luck, and don't worry about what people think. In my book your still one of the smartest people i know, (from just what you told me of course). I respect you.|`|S3uLASLnaa	Oh tough situation. I mean you are very ahead, 17/18 and a junior in college already, that's very impressive! If you are pregnant, and you cant take care of the baby, i say why not take on open adoption?|`|0vo7tDP5aa	a baby would make you happy? and your a 17 year old college student?<br>  <br>  i thought you were smart. but okay. have the thing, and ruin your life and your youth.|`|AA12270560	I like what you said "In my own opinion, a baby would make me happy, of course; however, like I said, I am so scared of what people would think of me!"<br>  <br>  I always think of what others would think of me before I do something and i'm trying to get past that now.  I think if your against it and a baby would make you happy you should have it if you are pregnant. First take the test and see.  Best of luck!|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	Well a child should be percieved as a gift from God, and if you are pregnant you will have to decide whether to keep it or give it up for adoption.  Just talk to your parents.  Come up with a plan so they know that you have thought this out.  And if your father loves you he will accept it, he may not like the situation but he will accept it.|`|qiHNnZh7aa	it is good that you don't want to abort and if you have decided to have it then donut worry about the world coz what has happened has happened and nothing can change it but yes before you turn out into any conclusion take a test<br>  good luck|`|dxeOlRBfaa	you sound like a really strong person and if you are pregnant I hope that u make the decision that feels most right to you. :)|`|7dKFVQQbaa	You have to do what is right for you! Your parents may be initially upset, but once you have this amazing child, they will love him/her sooo much! Life is precious, and I know you will love your baby so unconditionally that you could never imagine your life without them. I know this must be scary, but don't get an abortion out of society pressure. If you don't want to, or can't, raise the child, then there are tons of family's who will love to adopt him/her. <br>  Good luck with everything! Don't worry about what other people will think, this is your life. And you aren't the first teen to get pregnant. You know in your heart what you want and what is right.   :)|`|8ddb7a13bfc50d6825c6a6f035345b83aa	Sounds like you're a pretty well grounded person.<br>  i'm not sure what your question was exactly..<br>  but all i can say is if you're against abortion, don't even make it a choice.<br>  the way i see it abortion is legal murder.<br>  i'll be praying for you and your boyfriend to make the right decision.|`|CaoVS1cdaa	If you were against abortions, you would not even consider it!!!! If you felt you were ready then that means you knew the consequences! You do have a lot going for you from what I read but that is no excuse....even if you have an abortion you will have to live with that for the rest of your life you would be a murderer people think that just because you can't see the baby or it hasn't completely formed it really doesn't exist but the reality is that, that is another life....But you do what you feel is right!!!   ----WWJD----|`|GsRpZJX5aa	well its really up to you and your boyfriend if you want to keep the child. i dont or anyone else has a say in that. but if you do decide to keep the baby yeah...your parents are probably going to flip, but sooner or later they are going to have to accept it. i think when it comes down to it you will get a lot of help. and i know it might seem hard. but try not to care what others think about you. just stay in school and do your best in your situation. dont worry. everything works out. good luck i hope the best for you!|`|kD0zNJLqaa	well to start were just about the same age i'll be 18 in about a month<br>  keep the baby<br>  watch the secret life of the american teenager get ideas from there<br>  well if ur in college people assume that you are in your 20s or older so i don't think society will be all that hard on you<br>  don't have an abortion<br>  and don't care what people will think of you that would be being an irresponsible parent<br>  who cares what they think do what you feel is right<br>  if the test is positive you must tell your parents<br>  remember you are the one who decided to do "it" so by doing "it" you decided to take on all the responsible and risks that go along with it<br>  so if your are pregnant it is ur problem and you must deal with it with responsibility|`|W61p5bCfaa	i had a prego scare once to....im ur age and my parents are crazy, however i little more understanding i think. anyway, it was a false alarm, bt if u are actually prego, u need to make a decision, wats more important?: the baby or society?|`|zNNAyDO4aa	take the pregnancy test.<br>  then if it turns out positive start talking.<br>  don't cancel plans that wouldn't be best so early.<br>  try not to think about it<br>  so much and if you don' t want to get an <br>  abortion then by all means don't get one.<br>  <br>  plus its your body.|`|go4R8pN3aa	If you used a condom and if it didnt break or anything, its unlikely you're pregnant. Sometimes when you're so sure you are, you start to create symptoms.<br>  <br>  Relax and take a test. You might be worried for nothing.|`|dm1Iy6koaa	help me,ill give you 10 points<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApqL0KP4E1TLimzrtIDLIOPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304195655AAG0eAy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|i9Rycd9Haa	its a 21 century, have an abortion babe.<br>  <br>  the kid is gonna screw up your life ..because you're not ready.|`|01HjNcgyaa	Alright girl..think positive--yes condoms may not be 100% effective, but do the pregnancy test.if the results tell ur parents, yes fathers are like that cuz they want to protect their children. But many women aborted kids when they were young and now that there older regret it. It's taking a life away. think about it, u can have the baby, and then give it to an orphanage or you can abort it. But 1st take the pregnancy test. Hopefullly it can come what u want it to come out. Good luck*|`|5vNoy7O0aa	Being happy isn't all you need to think about if its positive. You need to think about if you can afford it, if your body is ready, your future, your boyfriend, and the consequences of having a baby so young. Can you afford a place where the baby will grow up in a safe environment, and big enough. There is a lot to consider beside your happiness unfortunately.|`|6t1CClfQaa	first things first dam ur smart as hell i guess, it really depends on what you really want to do with your life , you really seem like the person who can do a lot with ur life and in my experiences and what ppl have told me a baby might hold u back by alot, i suggest u talk 2 ur parents cuz no matter wut they always gnna be there, but u shouldnt tell them who it is dont be scared of them wut can they do 2 u no, u shouldnt care wut they say about u at all its wut u think of urself, if ur really against abortion there is always adoption i  really think that if ur against it you should have the kid and put it up for adoption if ur against abortion that much, but again u really seem like the person who can succed in life and a kid would really slow u down in life my opinion.|`|AA11382993	Im totally against abortion and I feel that if your responsible enough to have sex no matter if you use protection or not then you need to be responsible enough to take care of the baby if you get pregnant. I wasn't ready to have a baby but i got pregnant and im so glad that i have my son, I would do anything for him. You should tell your boyfriend 1st then tell your dad that you have to tell him something very important and you don't want him to judge you or do anything irrational. And just tell him. Tell him on the phone, you can always hang up if he gets too upset and let him cool off. Good Luck hope you decide to keep it. BABIES DO NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE!!|`|KW0hPZhxaa	My two greatest and proudest achievments in my life are my beautiful daughters.<br>  Having a baby will change your life and change you profoundly but if you are ready to be totally depended on and devoted to a child then do it, only you can know if it is right for you. Just because you are young wont make you any better/worser mother, some are hopeless at any age.<br>  Remember YOU wont be the focus anymore, not for a long time...your focus will have to be BABY and it is a major undertaking. So think long and hard.<br>  Having a child isnt the end of the world or the end of your life (its the end of your life as you know it,though) Its a whole new beautiful beginning.|`|aBMc8J4xaa	I've been in your situation. And mind you, I was only 15 that time. It was so courageous of me to continue my pregnancy despite knowing what others might think of me, and my fathers' reaction to me, not to mention the complications of teenage pregnancy that awaits me. All the negativity had crossed my mind yet that wasn't enough for me to take a risk of not having a kid in the future anymore or having an abnormal kid, if I aborted my child.<br>  <br>  I'm not against abortion but I just didn't do that because of the aforementioned situation that I am scared of. In fact, If I got accidentally pregnant again--but I think it won't happen anymore--I will have an abortion. (God knows I try not to be a hypocrite).<br>  <br>  Today, As a single mom who is supported by my parents, I am currently living happily with my kid and I'm also finishing my studies. By the way, I never heard any negative words from my friends/relatives--they're even very understanding and comforting to me. They're even amazed by my courageousness as a mother in an early age. <br>  <br>  It's how you deal with your mistake after you fell, people see you. And if people could see how much you've changed a lot to the better after what happened to you, how much do you think your own father will be proud of you?--but if you're gonna mess your life up after that, then you'd just better expect negative responses from other people.|`|nXAvk8B8aa	i understand how you feel im 17 and pregnant as well and my boyfriend is 23 i dont date high school guys either but im almost six months and decided to keep my baby im protestant and of course im agianst abortion but it wont stop your life you can still go to school and make something of yourself when  i told my mom and grandma who rasied me they surprised me and are trying to be here even though it took my grandmother some time to get around it but im starting college in the fall and my boyfriend is very supportive of me and my dreams and is also a devoted father to our unborn daughter but i tell you this if you do abort the baby it'll bring you down alot worse physcially a|`|u1eyI15Baa	Think about what will happen to your life when the baby is born.<br>  What will the changes be<br>  Where are you gonna live<br>  Where will the money come from<br>  <br>  Your parents will be shocked and would wanna kill you when they first hear about it but im sure that after they've cool down for a bit, they'll support you all the way. After all, it is your decision.<br>  <br>  A baby would make you happy but being a mom is 24/7 care for your baby and for the first 6 months, you will have to breastfeed it half the time and you will not have time to do anything else. Talk to your family doctor about it.<br>  <br>  All the best :)<br>  Ps. tell your mom first<br>  <br>  <br>  - Supermann
IVympPe0aa	You don't have mixed feelings about it.. you want to bang her badly..don't lie. But from a girl's perspective, absolutely do not go into any situation expecting you will get some. If she wants to, that's up to her. But things will work out in your favor in the end if you act like you'd rather take things slowly--instead of trying to do something on every date. Trust me. You'll know when she's ready. And she may already be ready this next time, who knows!!|`|tEw657Ufaa	I think it is you who is expecting to be grabbed inappropriately :-)|`|mvGh30TFaa	Hell yeah. :]

If he is madly in love with you. But in this case, he will be staring just once or twice and that too he wil be looking at your eyes with love, and you will immediately understand that he is in love with you. Since you cant figure out what is the reason (This is not the reason why he stares at you)<br>  2. You are the worst or rare person he has ever seen. ( I guess this is the reason for him staring)<br>  <br>  Try dressing decently and be a bit more clean. He will soon stop staring :)|`|eQENZXz1aa	he is picturing you naked|`|7HchEDo2aa	Maybe it's your horrible grammar?

You have to make him feel as if he can really come to you when he's having problems. Family is all you got after all. Please don't tell.

The pros of weed that could explain his use are <br>  here are several other effects that can be considered beneficial such as:<br>  <br>            o Increased appetite due to the fact that food subjectively tastes better.<br>            o Reduced nausea<br>            o Dilation of air sacs in lungs, resulting in deeper respiration.<br>            o Increase in productive coughs<br>            o Dilation of blood vessels (vasodilatation)<br>            o Increased blood flow and heart rate<br>            o Reddening of the conjunctivae<br>            o Induces drowsiness , so it can be beneficial to sufferers of               insomnia and sleep deprivation<br>            o Relaxation<br>            o Reduced stress<br>  <br>  Weed also has medical uses, I smoke weed at least once a week because i have an ulcer, and it helps my appetite come back without the pain. My man smokes weed because it calms him down. He over thinks things and worries what every one thinks of him, but when he is a bit buzzed or stoned he doesn't care.<br>  As long as it does not affect his daily life (such as going to work stoned, Driving high, ect) then it should be okay. Lawyers, Cops and Dr's. smoke weed, (Source: The Friendly Stranger- Toronto you can see all types of people there..) Of course there are the stereotypes of the Greasy, stupid stoner (Like that 70's show) but weed is ok until some one 'NEEDS' it to function.|`|fsF2SSVHaa	why would you c0ckblock your brother like that? its his own buisness, not yours.

When it comes to most guys (especially shy ones) they tend to stutter and mess their words up when talking to a girl, best thing you can do is ask him directly (take him somewhere quiet). Ask him "you like me, dont you?" that question not only limits what his answer will be down to "yes" and "no" but it reduces the many ways of him to mess his words up if he becomes incredibly shy. So all in all, best way to deal with someone who is shy is by being direct, you dont want to make them increasingly nervous. hope this helps.|`|qzqmXnLbaa	what are you a freshmen?? i don't remember how old i was when i was a freshmen i think i was 14 but anyway. . . when i was a freshmen i had the same deal with a boy i liked, i was in love with him for 3 years during high school until a realized that he just wanted *** and i stopped talking to him and had a lot more fun with out him.

In a way I think (for those who don't admit it) guys want a girl thats not like so girly but still has the femmine side to her, but if you can pal around and just have fun it's like hangin with one of the boys ya know.. Just my opinion being a guy.. hope it helps|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	im not a guy, but it depends on dude doesnt it. because everybody has a different opinion, just like i may think a guy skate boarding and listens to screaming music, is the biggest turn on ever, the next girl might be into some fancy rich guy who takes violin lessons.<br>  same with girls.|`|0YBBz4olaa	I wouldn't say it makes her any hotter, but it doesn't make her less hot either. but, it does keep you fit and that is hot. <br>  (I'd love to see your hot body!)|`|XCdNscFqaa	not necessarily those specific things but a gal who takes good care of her body and stays in shape is hot.|`|vIPyklrFaa	yes.|`|Umi6w7Q8aa	i wouldnt say its "hot" but it doesnt make things worse|`|Sj4vrnXXaa	depends on the guy<br>  <br>  ...to me, no<br>  <br>  but to others...sure|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	For me masculine qualities in a girl can be very sexy.

sCTPvVnuaa	It's because you haven't had it in a long time. Biologically, we need to feel "the real" thing, and yes, hormones and ovulation have to do with it, but it gets tougher because you go on without having it. For example, a guy satisfying himself is not fully satisfied and feels disappointed because it's nothing compared to the real deal. Same goes for the girl. If you haven't had it in a while, and you satisfy yourself, it's not going to be adequate enough and you want it more. You need to have the real deal in order to satisfy yourself fully. It's nature, and there is no way around it. You will want it more and more when this time comes around, and who knows, you might just do this with a random guy one night, someone you don't know well, because you can't control it anymore. It's a combination of all these things, and if you want to get rid of it, ask your boyfriend or a significant other.|`|1xL0UwUjaa	Two things:<br>  <br>  1. You're hormones and you're on your 14th day of the cycle<br>  2. You haven't had it in a long time<br>  <br>  Solution:<br>  You need to have sex or else you're going to keep going through this without getting satisfied truly. This is why girl's can't live without guys and guys can't live without girls. It's only going to get worse unless you do it.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Your period is coming soon and your hormones are responsible.|`|aQAxs0XWaa	Its ur horomones dude...after ur first one...u kjeep<br>  wanting more...its cuz ur still young...when ur young...ur<br>  hormones are like all moving around really fast and stuff...its natural..<br>  and remember...DO IT SAFELY!...We have too many young parents.
JoX8D638aa	You should tell her.<br>  I know that sounds harsh, and you should definitely be nice about it.

3MmVWDT3aa	No, we look away. We don't want them to think anything...|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	yeah we stare when we like a guy lol it's hard no to! as far as looking away or keepin eye contacs when he notices, that changes based on the girl|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	yeah i'll try.|`|bVukDk8gaa	Honestly. if I like the guy & he catches me looking, I'll look away.<br>  <br>  But if we are just staring at each other, then I'll usually break the stare off within a couple seconds.<br>  <br>  I get too nervous to stare the guy that I like in the eye for too long!<br>  :)<br>  <br>  But, sometimes I do stare, & I don't even notice! Even if he is looking back at me, I won't notice that I'm staring! <br>  haha|`|oOD3dYaNaa	I'd say that it all depends on the girl's personality. If she's shy, then she'll look at you but if you make eye contact, she'll look away quickly. This means that you have to make the first move and talk to her. If she's confident, she'll hold your gaze and smile. But most girls will look at a guy until he looks at us, because we don't want to be seen as weirdos. LOL =]|`|lIcKd8Hdaa	Well if i like that someone, then i would stare constantly, but only when i think he is not looking at me.

pQGUPITeaa	It's pretty simple - you're interested in her and she's not interested in you. So you obsess over everything she says, exaggerate it all, and then it seems like she's having wild mood swings.<br>  <br>  I suspect most of this is just in your head and has very little to do with the real girl.|`|kERP7zAhaa	girls are moody. get used to it. and maybe she doesn't feel that way for you and that doesn't make her a lesbian or shallow. you can't make yourself like someone.<br>  <br>  stop judging|`|RnQFwIuUaa	Just because she doesn't want to be in a relationship, doesn't mean she is shallow or a lesbian. She may not like your type, your personality or your look. That's not to say that she is right or wrong, but it is who has what she likes, who will win her. Lighten up.
1hlIzEnTaa	hmm tough call hunn! I was in a relationship for over 5 years, I'm not the jealous type either.. but he never gave me a reason to be, as bad as it sounds I knew he wouldn't do anything with anyone else, it was very unlikely because he's not that good at picking up..lol harsh I know, but i always wondered if maybe that was why I never felt jealous, because I knew I didn't have competition? But also he was the same way, not the jealous type at all and that's one of the best things about our relationship is that we had so much freedom with other people, but could still trust each other. HOWEVER, I also doubted being in love with him, yes I love him to death but not in the way I needed to, so finally I broke it off and it was definitely the right decision for me, I know now I was never in love with him, and it still doesn't bother me if he's around other girls, he's definitely still one of my best friends.. and I guess that's what I mistook for being in love.<br>  Hope you can sort things out! This is a tricky one, maybe if you can take a bit of a break from each other, see how you feel when he's not there? If it hurts you to be broken up, or if you're fine and can move on?|`|589XBd5Yaa	well, i can't tell if you're in love with him or not since ur "new" to relationships, so u may not truly know if you actually are in love or just love their company or something else besides love.<br>  <br>  as for not being jealous? it's fine. it probably means that you have full confidence in your relationship with your boyfriend and know you can trust him without having doubts, which is GOOD. Be glad you aren't jealous because some girlfriends can be so jealous about their boyfriend even talking to ANY girl or anyone that isn't a guy.|`|iG3sM3I3aa	It means that you care for him, but you are also comfortable around <br>  his gal pals. Don't worry, those other girls are his friends but NOT GIRLFRIEND.
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Yes, women really want men to be THAT honest.  Women believe that level of honest would make a perfect relationship.  And women have nothing to hide and they can be honest.<br>  <br>  The mistake come in that the women assume the men are exactly like the women.  Nothing could be further then the truth.  Guys are sick, freaks...to put it nicely.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Yes.  I would want the guy to be totally honest with me. Say if he cheated on me. If he told me I would be ticked and would want to smack him but he might get a second chance depending. If he kept it from me and I found out he would get smacked and his a** would be dumped on the spot.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	I think most women say they want men to be COMPLETELY honest, but half of them don't want to know the truth.  They don't want to be confronted with what they may or may not hear.|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	It would be hard to hear, but I rather him tell the truth than keep it a secret.|`|1LTrZbxwaa	Women say one thing, but really want something else.|`|JeNN7ZNqaa	true|`|AA10395956	Women say their husbands/boyfriends should be more honest, when they finally do, they complain how he was honest. So I'd think that women would have trouble finding someone that isn't that honest, but isn't much of a liar either. Or to find the right times to lie, and the right time to be honest. Telling a deep secret would be honest, but i'd say really honest is someone that tells what they really think on a regular basis|`|y4JrDSLUaa	Perhaps it would be hard to hear, but in the end, I would only think of him as a stronger person for going through it, and for having the courage to tell me. It's our worst experiences in life that make us into the strong individuals we are, and give us the ability to hold our heads up high.|`|NzlBvsOmaa	I think womenn just pretend that they want to know the wholee truthh.<br>  While, they actually don't want to hear everythinq, which is kinda confusing but it's true. <br>  Women pretend they want the man to be honest while they know the truth will hurt moree andd it's not what they wanna hear.|`|cxytFfvKaa	in my opinion i want to know absolutely everything possible. i know thats not realistic but it really annoys me when i find out that a guy didnt tell me something.. no matter how little it is. <br>  if your girl is into the whole honesty thing i think you should be completely honest with her.|`|Mr3112o5aa	well every girl different, some like it and in your case some don't, just remember every guy is different to, some like to put out there feelings and there secrets and some don't|`|M1B1EvI7aa	woman like an open guy but dont over do it|`|6C3i2fyxaa	be true.|`|pwXK9A4haa	ha...ha...ha... if you're not his fantasy than your selling each other short.|`|ul0KrsjCaa	i think women want men to be honest, but by honest they just want what they want to hear to be true and when its not they're dissapointed.

Two people can fit in a twin bed, you just have to be lieing close to eachother which if your having sex togethor shouldn't be a problem now should it? In fact you usually are on top of eachother unless I've always known the wrong thing! So your only taking up one person room anyway lol. Plus most people don't end up sleeping with eachother after sex in college...they just go home.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	You do it on the floor!!

oWtDt5WNaa	show her your moving on. that makes me miss my ex's. another thing is dont bother with her anymore. DONT CALL OR TEXT HER.. talk to other girls and dont even bother to look if shes looking. make her think she passed up someone good.. hopefully someone starts to show intrest in you.. like another girl and she sees what she could have had but cant anymore
H4W29m7Baa	Make her wonder, if you're always around or if she always knows what you're up to, she'll feel more in control. If she doesn't see you where she normally would, or you don't show up somewhere she expects you to, it will make her wonder more about you. Talking with other girls is a great plus, obviously she was curious if she was looking from a distance. Chances are that she misses you just as much.. she just doesn't want to give in.

3b303945f40f083a0a27c9df49f6a262aa	It appears that after your first marriage, you became, knowingly or not, extremely protective. Maybe its not only that he doesn't feel needed when he is around you, it may be that you are subconciously not wanting to be around with him so much.<br>  My suggestion, just because you know how to take care of yourself, does not mean you have to. Let him just do some menial tasks, stuff that may not seem important, but believe me, even just that will make him feel better.<br>  You don't have to let your guard down, or seem of not needing anybody. It is not a 2-way choice.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	Hun it sounds like he likes the fact that you are independent, but he is looking for a place to stand in your life, so he can feel good about being part of it.<br>  Explain to im, why your independence is important to you, how hard it was for you to be self sufficient again after the divorce, also tell him WHY he is important part of your life....no phony baloney ego boosting, honest up front conversation|`|LcweeMrLaa	Good for you for being independant!  Don't let it go.  I agree that it sounds as though he may be a little low on self worth and you don't need that.  I'm not saying you should dump him, though.  Talk to him about it.  Ask him what you could do to make him feel needed by you.  Sex and all that will only do so much.  I once read that feeling unappreciated was the #1 reason why a man cheats...|`|fV2SYj60aa	Just ask him to do little things for you, like drive you somewhere or something. Or if he offers to like, pay for dinner or something, let him.  And thank him and be really appreciative of it.|`|lf6tjzK4aa	Just express gratitude when he does help you by saying something like "I really couldn't have done such and such without you." If he needs any more affirmation of worth than that, he's probably in need of counseling or something.|`|aZwr6ck8aa	I don't understand the first guys answer....but anyways.....just let him do stuff for you.  Actually say you need him just not in those words.|`|FJbzvDPtaa	give good love to him ,but show him you love him|`|GtBthjKkaa	be more clingy? maybe he likes clingy girls|`|zgDQrI2uaa	Bugs.  When ever I think hubby wants to feel needed I do the, "eek a bug," thing.  The, "I can't open this jar can you, and I can't reach that would you get it," also work.  They are all relatively minor and don't really mean that you give up your independence, and of course I don't do it often, but it seems to boost him a bit. <br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt to every now and then ask him how he would solve a problem you have.  It shows you value his opinion.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	just love him|`|0ucm3dmyaa	Just be cute around him and kiss and hug him (can even tease a bit, playfully), show him your love, always be happy that he is with you, share your problems (to show you need him to listen but don't go too far 'cause most guys don't like emotional or complaining stuff), and try asking him for help doing household thing (like fix up jobs, etc.).|`|MqoOPi9Xaa	sex, sex, sex|`|e2e8e03326f17e0af0fd766ade6233f9aa	Put out, a lot.|`|VMoDsdREaa	let him pay all the bills.
779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	ask him what the deal is, because he has no reason to be ignoring you just because he is with his friends. he's being an ***, and you need to tell him he can't do that anymore because it's completely stupid.|`|cdUCCHgaaa	maybe he is uncomfrotable with u telling him u love him. or maybe hes an *** and he cares more about what his friends think. orrrr your calling him to much? wait until you both get back from the mountains and arrange to meet, then ask him whats going on, why wont he talk to u in front of his friends. let him know its okay to be honest, meaning DO NOT GET PISSED! and if you can help it try not to cry. so sorry this is happening to you love. SOO JEALOUS YOUR IN THE MOUNTAINS BTW!|`|ajKJcoBFaa	I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT IF YOU LIKE HIM BEACUSE IF HE INGNORS YOU WHEN HES WITH HIS FRIENDS THEN WHAT KIND OF BBOYFRIENDIS THAT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM AND SEE IF HE HAS THE SAME FEELINGS AND IF YOU DOSENT THEN I THINK THAT YOU DESERVE BETTER.<br>  BUT IF YOU RRELAYLOVE HIM THEN YOU SHOULD RRELAYTALK TO HIM.|`|cxytFfvKaa	talk to him about it and stand up for yourself! if you dont change his behavoirs now it will only get worse. you dont deserve to be ignored.|`|6C3i2fyxaa	watta waste man ... tell him .. wtf watta jerk its like hes embrassed to have a girlfriend or seomthing ... Talk to him and tell him how u feel,.|`|WINstG32aa	Gosh i hate it when guys do that! Okay Kennedy you really need to talk to him or something because if that gets you mad then tell him something maybe, "hey why don't you like me to talk to u around your friends?" ask him!<br>  I don't think that you or any girl should be treated that way from a guys i know it sounds sexist or stupid but its just lame, don't let him or any guy treat you that way. Who knows maybe hes just like that or maybe he just wants a good time to talk to you.<br>  Another thing maybe it bugs him that you call him baby or that you've told him that you loved him so soon....i don't know im just saying...

Been there, done that.<br>  If I were the girl in this situation, I'd obviously want to know if someone "liked" me. <br>  So I think you should try talking to her more. Maybe at lunch, in the halls, or at the games after school. I get this all the time, and everytime-- i love itt. If you were to just go up to her randomly or sit down next to her and be like wow, your really pretty.<br>  She'll be flattered, yet impressed you have the guts to do that.<br>  It doesn't matter what age you are. I'm younger, and I get older guys. And for the guys that are even younger than me, I would never just judge them on their age. Most girls wont. <br>  I think you have a good chance with this girl if you really make it an effort to try and get to know her. Then you'll probably get her number. Wind up texting with her all the time. And then eventually hooking up at your house after school somedays. <br>  This is what seems to happen at my highschool. So I'm sure it's the same where you are too. <br>  Good Luck! And I hope all goes well with you and this gorgeous girl. =]|`|ekvIb2s5aa	In my opinion, I would smile a few times, say hello if you pass her in the hallway, make yourself known if she doesn't know who you are. If she does know you, I would make small talk at first, but make sure you smile a lot! That's a great way to show that you are interested in her, or at least what she has to say. Mention that you'd like to hang out sometime, and see what she says. If she agrees then there ya go! If she kinda brushes it off then you might want to look in another direction!|`|nuyWduwqaa	You must first build a strong relationship with her, and get to know the "real" her. You can't fall victim to looks only, because you will always get hurt that way. Develop a strong bond with her, and get to know what she likes. After you have done that, you (and only you) will know when the time is right.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	You need to make yourself known to her. Wave to her, smile when you see her, ask her about some homework problem, etc. If you haven't seen her in a while, text her with some funny thing. Get her number from a friend.|`|W61p5bCfaa	talk to one of her friends and see if she is available, if she is, then u should write a note tellling her u think shes gorgeous and you would like to take her out one day.....very high school, but also very sweet! good luck :)|`|f9lR931Uaa	jus ask her one day if she wants to hang out on a friday or saturday. if she has a bf she will somehow let u kno

One thing isn't 100% effective. If you use both the pill and condom you will have better protection. If you still want to go ahead without the condom i say wait for about one month to have it really kick in.
QcUkrLWraa	LOL.<br>  I'm sorry, that made me lol quite a bit.<br>  <br>  This guy's a freak. Tell him he's annoying. I don't mean to sound like a jerk but being harsh and truthful is the only way to do it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Doesn't matter. Be mean to him anyway. Not TOO mean, like "f*ck off you f*cking annoying-a*s tool" but just be like "Dude, I don't like you. Stop bothering me" if he claims to not like you, say you don't care and that you still don't like him romantically or otherwise and that you don't want him talking to you.|`|Xd1acIA0aa	have your boyfriend beat the hell out of him|`|whWIAiuKaa	In order to not sound like a presumptuous *****, ensure that he does still like you. (Yes, I know it's frank, but, trust me on this)<br>  <br>  If he does, tell him, point blank, that you do not like him; it's succinct and  somewhat harsh, but it does transmit the message.<br>  <br>  I had a similar problem with a guy, and dropping the "let's just be friends" bomb does not work.<br>  <br>  lmao.|`|Ot34f3Ndaa	Pay him no attention. He'll leave you alone eventually.

o96wvl3naa	Do it when the time feels right. You will know when the time is right and i can 100% guarantee that when it's right you will know exactly what to say just start with what you love about her and that you would like her to become your girlfriend|`|Q5HJfJFZaa	Parties and wine bars - you're almost going out anyway!! You're almost in! I'm an asian girl and notice asian guys are super shy. It's cute for a while, but when nothing happens, it's time to move on. Girls want to be with a man, so man up and ask her out. The worst she can say is no. And the best is yet to be seen.<br>  Good luck!!|`|mZBctgn8aa	be your self, let her know who you really are and then ask her if she would like to "hang out with you" but dont ask her on a date yet just let it flow. if you dont know what to do. just let her lead.|`|6b99ab7b51f7e492ad518dd971336395aa	You have to belive in yourself and you cant label her a white chic or you a asia guy,go for otherwise never know..So what if your shot down happens to everyone bro.|`|MmjGvTSfaa	Dude the evidences that you showed us just stated that she LIKES you.

Good Luck!!|`|rJu4X6MDaa	race shouldn't matter, just ask her out.|`|4KRSUhXLaa	yeah, coffee, movie and lunch are basically nice for first dates. you're doing a great job. i don't think you need help at all. you're a-ok at this... just make sure the girl you are asking out likes to have lunch or just have a plain conversation with you while having coffee. since they are all somewhat close to you i mean since you all know them from class and work then you alone can figure out what each of them would appreciate while being with you. i hope you're having a great time.<br>  for your question... coffee, movies, dining out, or just merely hanging out are the intial steps to a date.. these would be the list of what to do if it's a first date. these are the nicest that you can do so that you won't have trouble with moving too fast or too slow on a girl.. and you get to know them better ... best places would include the shore/beach, her house to show some respect, the mall, a restaurant, a coffee shop, or just driving around in your car.<br>  take care now.... =)|`|wck4MHREaa	I think, at the very least, she enjoys your company. If she went out with you multiple times, then she sees something in you- at least, something that she might be attracted to. So you shouldn't worry too much about how to approach asking her out. Just do it; ask, "Hey, I'm going to this cool bar/club/whatever tonight with some friends (or don't mention friends if you aren't bringing anyone) and I think you should come with, it'll be fun". Or if you want to be even more direct (as in try to get a "date" with her status), just say "Hey, wanna get together sometime?".<br>  <br>  That's it, but in case you need some help with your "game"...<br>  <br>  Here's a tongue-in-cheek guide of what you need to do, from me to you!<br>  <br>  1. Flirt with her, a lot, while you're out. Show interest in her, and she'll at least pick up a hint.<br>  2. Have a stack of funny stories/questions, etc to share with her when you're just talking so that you won't have to worry about running out of things to say.<br>  3. Along with flirting, get some light touching in there as well- hold her hand while you pretend to read her palm or play a game with her, arm around the shoulder- the more you escalate with this, the more she'll get used to you touching her- and the more likely that she won't refuse to kiss you.<br>  4.Seduce! How? Beats me, that's up to you.<br>  5. ????<br>  6. Profit!|`|nUj4Cw5Iaa	If you like this girl, and it seems like she likes you too... then my best advice is to be totally honest about how you're feeling. TELL her that you're into her, cuddle with her, tell her she's beautiful, buy her flowers, open the door for her. TELL her that you're looking for a relationship. You can do it, the worst thing that could happen is that she's not interested.|`|qCgfcu6uaa	well you should find out if she likes you back, ask around ,ask her friends but don't make it like your a stalker, and if she does then just talk to her  and find out where you to are at but then if she doesn't, tell her that you understand and that there plenty more fishies in the sea or you could just grow some balls and just  ask her out?|`|6mL7gmm4aa	umm first of all you can stop calling her a "white chick" its rude and degrading<br>  <br>  then, you can just start giving her casual hugs and stuff when you hang out, and then ask her in a completely NON PRESSURE situation what she thinks about you guys going out|`|L0OKjR6uaa	ok spend a day with her and make sure she really likes you then make the move just ask her if she wants to go out with you its not that hard idk y guys on here always make such a big deal about it all the bfs ive had asked me or told my friend hanah and she told me|`|iaJcfP9Eaa	Why don't you take her to dinner and tell her exactly what you wrote on the bottom half of your post. Be honest.

If i was you I would do it through text message.|`|AA10814887	say, wanna go out? its not that hard|`|2BvrMZ28aa	Well, the good thing is that you've already been out with each other a few times. I think you need to just trust your gut. If you guys seem to click, and you feel a good vibe, then just go for it. It may help if you go on a few more dates, just so you guys are comfortable with each other. <br>  <br>  And, you're right, if you don't ask, you'll always wonder, "what if?" If you're out on a date, and things feel right, then just tell her how you feel. Tell her you want more out of your relationship, and if she would be your girlfriend.|`|33IV2bDYaa	Hey, it's not lame.  It's hard to meet people sometimes.  Why not use all of your options?  There's nothing wrong or pathetic about it.  <br>  <br>  Ok, here ya go.  You've already been out with a few times and haven't made a move?  I'm assuming that you haven't kissed her or anything.  Sorry to tell you, it might be a little too late.  She may already see you as "just friends".  Bad place to be.<br>  <br>  Good thing is, it's possible that it's not too late.  Next time you're out with her find ways to touch her...no, not in that way.  Hold her hand, put your arm around her, pull her toward you, then push her away.  The more comfortable she is with you touching her, the less awkward everything else will be.<br>  <br>  Second, be fun and flirty.  All the stupid games we played as kids are fun all over again when we're older.  Thumb wrestle her...just don't let her win.  Call her names like dork or brat or nerd.  If there's an awkward silence, stick your tongue out at her.  Show her how much of a fun guy you are.  <br>  <br>  But listen to me here.  You do not want to deliver her any sort of message.  Not verbally anyway.  It can come off as insecure or needy.  You don't need to ask her to be your girlfriend or anything like that.  <br>  <br>  Girls are very emotional people.  Everything for them is based on emtions.  If somthing is verbalized it sort of ruins the emotional ride.  It's like watching a scary movie and just before someone get killed, your friend say "oh watch this, this is he gets killed".  <br>  <br>  Just be fun and let her enjoy the ride.  <br>  <br>  If things go good and you think you should kiss her.  Ask her "do you want to kiss me?"  She'll probably say yes, cool.  If she says no, then you can say "oh, you looked like you had something on your mind."<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you out a little.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|8xSd0qX6aa	Heyy...<br>  <br>  Just get it out and tell her... but as you said that you are shy.<br>  you can always try getting one of your good friends to go up to her and ask her for you. <br>  or <br>  * send a letter to her house (if you now were she lives)<br>  * When you see her give her flowers and a letter attached saying how much you like hanging around with her .... so on<br>  <br>  or if you wanna tell her yourself<br>   you can call her (if you know her number) and tell her. If you are too shy saying it face to face... usually calling the person it helps<br>  <br>  Ask her out some time just the two of you to a nice fancy resturant then when you to are having a good time tell her how much you enjoy her company,  .. she will get the message .. ;)<br>  <br>  try not to be so shy... but i know you cant help it if you like a person a lot... i know... hehe... anyway i wish all the best for you and her...<br>  i hope i helped you ...<br>  <br>  Maybe if you got to know her a lot better and you fell more comfortable around her you might not be so shy and then you might be able to tell her how you really feel .<br>  <br>  anyway GOOD LUCK|`|13KBWzBXaa	Wow! You got some really great answers!<br>  I agree with many of 'em.<br>  Just ask her out! The worst she can say is NO! The best she can say is yes!<br>  I married a Chinese (HK) girl. I loved it when she spoke Cantonese to me when we were dating. She taught me some words and phrases and we can speak a language that nobody else knows. (of course if you speak Cantonese that won't be the case in Toronto! Maybe in Aurora?)<br>  <br>  As to the whole "white chick" "Asian guy" thing, if y'all become more than friends, this racial thing will come up once in a while, but probably never between your two, at least never in a bad way.<br>  If you live your life for other people and govern yourself by what they think, you'll have a very unhappy life.|`|a2f975873846ee8ced72fab76fde0c44aa	Just politely ask her what she's doing next week and simply ask her if she wants to go hang out, catch a movie and grab a bite to eat. If she says yes, great. If she says no, then tell okay maybe some other time.|`|MKHd10MYaa	It's very easy to melt a girl's heart. All you have to do is a cute thing or two and throw in some sweet little words.<br>  <br>  If you want to ask her out, do something cute for her to go with it. Perhaps go out and eat with her or something. Make her have to go use the restroom. When she does, leave a rose or a bouquet of roses where she sits and hide behind some place. Have a note inside and have it say something like: Go out with me, yeah?<br>  <br>  And yeah. I don't know, that's just an idea. Do something cute to go along with it though. Melting a girl's heart is easy.|`|gzERnclQaa	Just relax and be yourself.

ud0gPY3baa	Okay this is an answer from my older brother who is 22:<br>  Butt<br>  <br>  And this an answer from my younger brother who is 13:<br>  Boobs <br>  <br>  So from those answers I guess older guys prefer butts and younger guys prefer boobs? I don't know since I'm not a guy....<br>  But I think younger guys prefer boobs because that's the closest thing to their face that they can stare at without looking weird (imagine guys looking at your butt all the time....)|`|edfRUVeSaa	definately butts.;-) i think we immediately associate a nice @$$ w/ good sex. its just in our nature. not saying i don't like a pair of nice boobs, but im much more turned on my a nice butt. hope that helped|`|7MxJVtbYaa	depends on the guy. i prefer butts but boobs are good too. remember guys dont only care about looks but looks are about everything in getting started.|`|hwDtWCAjaa	i like butts more|`|ulUBv22eaa	boobs|`|PzNxM0Yfaa	Depends on the guy.

Overall, it doesn't matter to most guys.  If a guy focuses on one thing over the other, he's in it for the physical aspect.  To me, it doesn't matter if a girl has a big butt or a small chest or what ever combination you have.  It's not a single aspect that makes a good looking woman, it's how everything blends together, how everything is well proportioned.  I shouldn't even say that.<br>  <br>  Oh well, all in all, it doesn't matter :)
0vMcj7wEaa	I had this problem too, and unfortunately led up to a break up. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd try to turn him on subtlyy , perhaps by wearing outfits he finds sexy or looking especially hot on certain days. I know this may seem graphic of immature, but when doing everyday tasks try positioning your body in a rather sexy position(don't pull a muscle in the process lol).<br>  <br>  The one thing that may fail is if you over do trying to have sex with him and he just becomes overwhelmed/annoyed. <br>  <br>  If that fails...summer is around the corner, and I'm pretty sure he can't wait to see you in a bathing suit! Good Luck!|`|4v0s58Yfaa	I am in the same boat.. <br>  some times i feel like i have to plead for it.. <br>  i never get it when i want it... <br>  only when he does... ughh..<br>  <br>  usually its because he is really tired and has worked alot so thats what he usually says. sometimes i feel like its just cause he isn't attracted to me anymore and doesn't wanna see my in that "light"<br>  <br>  but i would just talk to him, see why he doesn't wanna??<br>  <br>  So no advice really... i wanna know the answer too!!

You just gotta go with the flow and take things slowly and dont give your all just do it in baby steps when you feel your comf to open up....

You have to remember that no matter how hard it is for you,  it is much harder for her because she is the one with the problem.  While I think you should be understanding,  You have live your life.  At some point she is going to have to learn to be more assertive in life or the world will eat her alive.  Trust me, I had to learn that the hard way.  I say be there for her, but don't let her get in the way of you living your life to the fullest.|`|bFwITbGIaa	be yourself and advice her to change...everybody wants to be happy and lucky...you must help her to overcome her anxiety...friends are the most precious gift if you know how to appreciate them|`|cx5Wm98baa	sixteen <br>  all you need to say<br>  you will grow up in a few years<br>  until then, stand by your friend if you can tolerate her through this
HKkbqlIuaa	She's either a really big flirt and was just messing with your emotions, or she was into you and isn't anymore. More than likely, she was into you. She was trying to get with you. Finally, because you took too long, she isn't interested anymore. She moved on. You should do the same.|`|NVdf3uAEaa	Dude she's meddlin' with your mind<br>  She has the nerve to call you her  bus buddy & then ignore you?!|`|iR7StHksaa	she probably is not interested maybe you should let her go.<br>  please i am confused : <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar0cnAWxR8VHH9LJHXITQwXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304203745AAAw4py">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Maybe she thinks that a) you didn't like her or b) you changed buses on purpose.<br>  <br>  Let her know you are interested... tell her you miss her, and ask her if she'd like to go out for dinner sometime.
dFHsAXDMaa	Okay none of those options really work.....how about sitting down with your parents and telling them how you honestly are feeling and if you really feel like you need to get away asking them if you can stay with your grandparents or aunt and uncle. you can not get a restraining order on someone who lives in the same house... you can not sue her she is a kid what would you get her ipod and cell phone? and running away where will you live how will you eat if you get sick how will you pay for doctor you need to think about this talk to mom and dad.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Or you could tell your parents what she's doing, and that you think she's taking advantage of you and you don't like it.|`|MGmXkWSKaa	really this is life...i have 4 siblings...<br>  u sound really young and vulnerable or trying to sound cool or something.<br>  its allset my sister does the same thing<br>  just get over it.|`|9LNtTfmgaa	Thats not sad, she makes fun of you for your hearing.

Also, what do your parents think about her behavior? Does she do this in public, around your friends, or hers, just at  home? Definitely you don't want to run away. Could a school counselor help by talking with your parents about the seriousness of the problem? Does your school have an anti-bullying policy? Even if it's your sister, she shouldn't get to break the rules. It's pretty common for an older sibling to treat a younger sibling this way - to a degree. They should still be protective and respectful though , and just be kidding when "making fun" of the younger one. Does your hearing difficulty affect your speech? Does your sister know how much her behavior hurts you? Talk to your parents, school counselor, a trusted teacher. Maybe your family needs a little group counseling. I don't know legally if suing her or a restraining order would be possible, and what you want to do is have a closer family, not make things worse by tearing each other apart. Good luck :)|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Are you parents aware of her behavior? It's wrong to tease you about your "hearing". Some day you and you sister will get along, maybe as adults. Until then, just ignore her as best you can. She is only looking to get a reaction out of you and if you don't give her a reaction, she'll get sick of teasing you because it will be boring when you don't react!|`|VCwTM7sGaa	are u a ***** or sumthing why  cant u stick up for urself their arnt gonna kill u or anything just tell her u wont do it if she hits u hit her back who gives a FUUCK? after u beat her she at least give u a bit of respect becuz in he eyes right now ur her slave show her, ur her sibling not a fuucking slave and stand up or urself or u want survive in life im serious. if she the muscular type get a stick or somthing stop getting **** from her. if your parnet like her more then fight if ur abused by ur parnets then fight back ur old enough to handle an adult.|`|rDizpzWOaa	you could always just talk to someone about it, i am not sure you can sue your sister for this. but talk to a elder that you trust.<br>  <br>  hope everything works out|`|mZnHKNEAaa	How about you stand up for yourself and let her know what it is!  No I'm not doing that. Make fun of her.

8yE2sYGeaa	Usually when you get divorced, you may petition the courts and have the proviso placed into the decree, "wife's former name shall be restored."; otherwise, you go by your current married name.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	You can choose, if you have kids and want to have the same name as they do, you can keep it or you can change yours and change theirs too. The person who said you can never keep it is wrong. I know someone who is divorced but she divorced after like 32 years of marriage and kept her husband's name cuz the kids were grown.|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	no you can't keep your ex's name<br>  well you can but why would you want a reminder|`|TPN1yIj7aa	i amalgamated my name and my husbands name. my kids also have this name. we like it it suites us. my mum divorced my dad but kept his surname. i think if you divorce you can still keep the married name. my mum did.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	I am assuming you are american. if you change back to maiden name and change it during the divorce tha tis smartest. it costs more if you wait.|`|B24W8w43aa	I know alot of women in the UK who kept their married name after divorce.|`|uec7RIhbaa	i don't think it matters.  it is up to the individual.  my sister got divorced but has kept her married name but many will decide to revert - i think partly as a statement of the marriage being over in some cases.  my sister kept her name partly because our maiden name is an unholy nightmare and partly b ecause she had been "robson" for several years, had all bank and passport etc in that name and everyone in her work place and the industry she works in knows her only by that name.  but i don't think there are any hard and fast rules.|`|qnBIXPx5aa	MAYBE I DNO AM JUST A TEENAGER|`|rev4lrn0aa	It will stay the last name that you changed it to. You can keep your married name or change it to your maiden name - it is all up to you. It won't automatically go back to your original name, you would have to go change it like you did when you got married.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	It's up to the individual. If you have children, you may wish to keep your married last name to be the same as theirs. But if no children are involved, you can easily change it back to your maiden name. But bottom line, it's your choice.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	It's up to you. If you want to keep his name you can, or you can revert back to your maiden name. I can't understand why after divorcing a man you would want to keep his last name though.|`|rQfzifT7aa	You can either keep your married name or you can take back your maiden name. If you choose to keep your married name, you can not later change it. If has to be done during the divorce.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	In North America you can keep it you like.  Usually it is easier that way if you have bills and stuff using your husbands last name.|`|AA10690306	That is your choice. From experience both my ex-wives took me for everything INCLUDING MY NAME!|`|9jiHVKpOaa	well my mom and dad got divorced after being married for 20 years and she kept his lasat name until she got remarried... and not my dads last name is now her middle name|`|RgEtKVaKaa	In my state in the US, you can keep your married name or you can revert to your maiden name.  If you do this at the time of the divorce, there is not specific cost tied to the name change.  If you choose to change your name after the divorce is final, the cost is significant - several thousand dollars.|`|OoNivmTlaa	It's up to you.You get a choice!I kept my married name (although he didn't like it lol) My mom also kept hers because she didn't want a different last name than me while I was in school.|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	I have been divorced a few times and I took my name back and was not interested at all to having my X's last name|`|381c7525bc309a1e29d4b3cf281f8a47aa	umm in USA you keep your married name because that is your legal name but you can change it back to your original name but it doesn't do it automatically you have to change it and you have to pay to do it too...i think?<br>  <br>  anser mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah7.soZjEuITb6cm.nfdjIsAAAAA;_ylv=3?qid=20090304180406AA4sUA9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|duk4iAgUaa	I believe it's up to you!|`|QHBuH39jaa	In the U.S. it is usually up to the woman.  She can keep his name if she wants it or ask in court to have it changed back and they will do the legalities of it.  Now, if there are kids involved you may not get to because they claim it is too confusing for the kids.  That is usually up to the judge or mediator.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	It's your choice. If it was a shorter marriage and you are not known professionally by that name then it makes sense to change back, rather then if you had been practicing medicine under your married name for 20 years. Me, I'd never change it in the first place.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Here in the US, you can keep your married name, or change it back.  You can actually change your name to whatever you want, but if it's something totally different, that takes a little more effort. ;)|`|wuZXqYPGaa	well in canada and us i know that you change it back to your original/maiden name... you never keep your last name of the person you divorced :)<br>  maybe its diff in UK|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	it doesnt change until u change it urself my parents are divorced have been for 10 + years and my mom finally changed her name back to her maiden name this year|`|KEUFaCkUaa	the good thing about being a grown up dear is you get to do whatever you want.  it's YOUR name. get it?|`|dJoE8yedaa	It depends on you.

VKLYkQ6zaa	he prolly likes you|`|eQENZXz1aa	sounds like he likes you and is shy|`|HHERTudVaa	he is probably really nervous. Dont worry about it too much. just keep interacting with him. Cuz if u let that slip away he will move on b4 u kjnow it and u need to keep his attention on you.|`|Cs6W9V3Baa	You do not need advice from this from anyone.  You need to copy your post into a letter.  You need to hand it to him and tell him to take his time and think about it because you really want to know what is going on.  If you like him, go ahead and tell him.  <br>  <br>  "Listen, I really like you but I sense a bit of awkwardness when we are together and I was wondering what that was about?  I also notice that when we are with friends you tend to pick on me a bit.  It may be in good fun and playful but it worries me.  Could you explain to me what you are thinking?  <br>  <br>  Do not confront him directly as if he is shy he will not have answers, possibly be afraid and may run.  Still, your questions are valid and you have every right to ask them.<br>  <br>  I suspect that you are more mature than he is. This happens between men and women. You have a vocabulary for relationships that he may not have at the moment.  That's why I encourage you to give him time. If you are important to him, he will find a way to respond.  Just don't put him under too much pressure to do so. That is why I think a note would be a good idea.
qp7SjypBaa	because it is SOO MUCH FUN. and truthfully, drinking only gets me sick, its not illegal to be high, there are NO bad side effects, you can drive. and girls love guys who have weed (id seriously know). except it smells bad... my benz stinks like febreze lol <br>  <br>  (: its awesome.|`|wck4MHREaa	It has the same appeal as alcohol or other drugs for some people- it's something you can take for recreation that'll help one loosen up their attitude and otherwise escape the doldrums of life. I actually smoked weed for the first time a month or so ago, and it was a pretty interesting experience- I totally get it, but It's not for me. If I were to use it more often, it would be a lame, easy way to avoid my own problems with schoolwork, friends, girls, etc instead of taking them on like a real man.<br>  <br>  It also makes food taste SOOO much better- The night I 'got high", I ended up eating a popcorn, a 1 liter bottle of soda, 2 liters of water, a BBQ chicken wrap from Islands Burgers, and a whole box of Kraft Mac & Cheese, and it was delicious!|`|9oXQDjxTaa	because it has medicinal and recreational purposes<br>  <br>  its fun, but you cant explain it, and every time your high its different<br>  <br>  "herb reveals you to yourself" - bob marley (i strongly agree, but shrooms and other hallucinogens to it even more)<br>  <br>  its not physically addicting, but it is psychologicaly --> meaning your body doesnt crave it like it does food or nicotine but your like, oh that was fun i really wanna get high right now|`|HIpf0a0Haa	it takes 23 times of doing something to get addicted to it, and twice that long to break the addiction. so i believe that people can smoke more then a few times and be able to walk away with out wanting to smoke again.<br>  And i believe that people smoke for many different reasons. it is a major stress end-er. so people smoke it to relax. and in some state doctors give it out as way for people to gain weight. in other words it gives people the munchies to they tend to eat more then a non weed smoker. <br>  I have meet people that smoke to calm their nerves and also to get over a family or friend's death. <br>  it would mostly depend in the situation to tell why people smoke it. every ones different and so are their needs.|`|nbx83LGnaa	just about all my friends smoke weed, all but about 3 or 4, and it extreemlyyyyy boring when there all smoking and laughing at the simplist **** while i just sit there, but i get the last laugh when they get the muchies afterwards and there is no food and shops are closed, Mwa-hahahaha lol,<br>  <br>  The other day they were laughing about cats, one started singing, then they all went real mellow, and they forget ****, smokin weed give you delayed reactions, (watch somone high play a Football gamelike fifa on PS3 FUNNY **** LOL, reactions to the ball are reaaaal slow) <br>  <br>  no need for weed, but i think better than ciggs|`|1eQmwOOcaa	People try weed because it s like smoking. You try it just to try it. Weed is not addictive. People say that because they want en excuse to keep doing it. I smoked weed back in the day and I am not addicted. I did a lot of drugs, which I do not regret, and I turned out very good.|`|mySbv7jhaa	People smoke weed cause there friends tell them too. That's why i started smoking.

Also, in a lot of countries, it's not illegal.|`|j24AyBnKaa	They get addicted to the "High" it makes them feel good , you aren't actually addicted to the drugs just the high LOL|`|p8TTH1Zxaa	Because people are idiots.

Because they want to. Just like people smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, eat spicy food, and red meat. Maybe its not good for you, but it can be fun. <br>  2.) Its not physically addicting, not like cocaine, nicotine, or even caffiene. It can be psychologically addicting, but you can become psychologically addcited to anything, even.......bananas...or something else random. <br>  <br>  3.) If you have a problem with it, dont do it.

ANYTHING you do while high is just 1000000x better.. seriously.. except excercising while high.. haha dont try it.<br>  <br>  2nd... it IS NOT ADDICTING. i could stop any damn time i wanted to, i just CHOOSE to smoke it because i like it.. i NEVER get any cravings during the day to be high, ever.. its my choice to smoke it, and i can just as easily deny it as i can accept it...|`|qT8yID3Taa	why the hell don't people smoke weed? hah.<br>  <br>  you free yourself, it's one way to find out who you are. <br>  by the way, you can't say it's "so bad" if you've never tried it?<br>  <br>  [=|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	huh?  dude you've got to hear this song.|`|2yJU8wqCaa	you have got to be the stupidest person<br>  ive ever heard, just kidding, but still<br>  that is preety dumb.<br>  people smoke weed to get high, because life<br>  is way ****** better high.<br>  its the same reason why people drink alcohol,<br>  because they wanna get outta their mind basically.<br>  AND IT IS IN NO WAY ADDICTING.<br>  alcohol is not addicting, did i also say that?<br>  So potheads and alcoholics are the same, you sorta get what<br>  im saying?|`|2NtiI51aaa	cause people enjoy doing it...<br>  if youve never done it before then you wouldnt understand<br>  <br>  its pretty much asking the same question..

EdBvqVuLaa	in a BOY, I'd like to have somebody who is funny, kind, caring, understanding, popular, cool, athletic/participates in multiple after-school sports, and receives A's (somebody smart). I want them to be about the same height as me and also have brown hair(or black hair). I'm planning to become a CEO or head boss of a company, or maybe a very successful doctor. If I have a boyfriend, I want them to support my dreams every step of the way, as well as help me when I'm going through my struggles. Also, nobody that is my boyfriend should ever be too strong looking..or more than a year older than me. Yes, age doesn't necessarily matter that much, but I want somebody who I can live a long happy life with, not somebody who will die when I'm only 40.I want a guy who will not always wear completely outrageous clothes. I want somebody who is tidy, and isn't completely lazy with everything. In other words, they don't leave papers everywhere and do at least a few chores each day. I don't expect my boyfriend/husband to have to know how to cook, but it would be nice to have somebody to cook alongside with. I'd like my boyfriend/husband to choose a bright career path, and nothing like working at Walmart. Also, my boyfriend/husband will be able to agree with my decisions on children and when I think it's ready. And related to that, I don't want my boyfriend/husband to only like me for my body or other pleasures, but instead be able to respect every bit of me-my personality and my body at the same time. I don't want somebody who drinks or parties too much, or anybody who smokes. Nothing in a gang either. Lastly, I don't want somebody that flirts with almost every girl they meet, or cheat on me. Those type of people are probably not very good people.<br>  <br>  I need help with my question...some good answers so far, but idk ,u might get it too!!

And doesn't balk when I speak mine. He has to be intelligent, but not a know-it-all. He has to be financially responsible. I don't mean rich. He can make minimum wage for all I care, so long as he can pay his bills. He has to be willing to stand on equal ground with me. I don't need a man that feels he's the supreme ruler of the castle, but I can't stand a man that has no backbone either. He has to be able to live with the fact that I'm fiercely independent. It's been a hard-won independence and I'm not willing to give it all up easily. He has to have a sense of humor and understand mine. I love a man that can make me laugh. Above all else, when I feel he's worthy of meeting my kids he has to love them like his own.|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	I want a guy who will always be there for me when I need to talk and who will listen or at least pretend to listen. A guy who isn't ashamed to kiss me or hold my hand in public or around his friends. A guy who I can trust and who I know trusts me. Someone who won't tell me what to do and will back me up in any descisions that I make in my life.|`|LT9BZmLNaa	I'm a girl, and I'm going to give you two different answers, kind of.<br>  There are things that are necessary in a boy, and then just bonuses.<br>  <br>  Necessities~~~~<br>  <br>  - funny<br>  - charming<br>  - relatively smart<br>  - good looking ( colors/race doesn't matter, it's just what they are)<br>  - good sense of style ( no corduroy pants)<br>  - nice ( treats you right)<br>  <br>  <br>  * If they want you for.. sexual pleasures, they can't make it obvious<br>  <br>  Bonuses~~~~~<br>  <br>  - not a tool<br>  - not an asshole<br>  - uses cheesy pick up lines XPP<br>  - doesn't call too often, once a day is fine. but doesn't make calling a chore, it's optional and it should be something they WANT to do.<br>  ****somebody who can be themselves, and i can be myself. that is huge.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question :]|`|lHK13vqwaa	well first off, i don't have a specific look, and really most people don't when it comes down to it.<br>  <br>  i know exactly what i would NOT want, which prob isn't helpful, but anyone who is dishonest, cheats, doesn't have similar values as i do, is really never going to work out. I really DO want someone who is honest, mature, silly sometimes, dependable, and loves me for who I am.<br>  <br>  I'm a girl, so i want a guy, and not to be mean, but i have never been attracted to someone who is overweight, its just a turn off. and don't ever think race is an issue, because i'm caucasian and i have liked asian, african american, indian, all types of guys.<br>  <br>  i usualy want someone who is within a 2 year range, considering i'm 17, and it would be weird if someone was way older, or way younger.<br>  <br>  turn ons are usualy, tall, mysterious/shyish OR the opposite, complete jockish outgoing and confident (sometimes thats anoying though). and most girls love an athelete ;)|`|Qbczt3ivaa	For a guy, he would have to be intelligent, caring, funny, a little sensitive, romantic, honest, and an overall good person..thats just about it for me :)<br>  As for looks, he doesnt need to be anything special, but nice feminine hands are great!|`|SbbCOmEsaa	I want them to be independent and strong. To stand up for herself, but at the same time not to treat everyone as beneath her and to be humble. Looks don't really matter, but in looks I would prefer someone good looking. Another thing that would make me like her is if she had a good sense of humor and was open with me. I would need her to be honest and sincere with me, and to like the corny things I would do for her. :P|`|V0Gq39sKaa	I want many things in a guy. I want him to respect me, value me, care about me and really love me. Also I want a good guy who is honest, truthful and who doesn't take me for granted. Who would do  anything for me and give me his sincere love and affection. A guy who will always be with me no matter what, in the good and the bad. Also I want a guy who accepts me for who I am and will always be by my side. Finally i want a guy whom i can trust and be not only my boyfriend but my best friend.|`|rhvA4G4Paa	gotta have a good sense of humor<br>  don't take stupid stuff too seriously<br>  is nice to other people<br>  good conversation (light and deep)<br>  spontaneous<br>  semi-awkward<br>  tell me when im being stupid<br>  makes me feel good about myself<br>  not a man whore<br>  doesnt use phrases like "babe" or "baby" GAG<br>  isnt a druggie<br>  doesnt sell drugs<br>  partying is ok, but not like everyday<br>  intelligent<br>  <br>  looks:<br>  i prefer tall<br>  not TOO  muscular<br>  good smile<br>  NICE HAND.

lDQef0uiaa	just flirt with him ! he belongs to u not the other girl ! so go ahead and flirt|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	you can still talk to him but, you cant be his girlfriend
rQfzifT7aa	Sounds like you two are in need of serious couple council ling. I mean come on, who throws steaks, that is childish.|`|RtkB46peaa	He's stressed out.  And you probably nag a lot.  I'm sure he was aware that he had burnt the steaks (and he didn't need your "help" by telling him), and I'm sure he KNEW you were going to come back and rub it in his face.  So he sort of rubbed it back.  Literally.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	Say goodbye....that way, you can give him a meat thermometer as a parting gift!!|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Wow. Talk about a short fuse.  Either he stressed big-time about something that you are not aware of, and maybe just needs some "time-out", or he wants out completely, and is just using this situation as an excuse to go.  All I can suggest is that you try to talk to him.  But if he wants to go, let him.  If he comes back, and you want him, great!  If not, then there's no point in you trying to force him to stay against his will and having a loveless resentful marriage.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	I am all for not being a doormat. But I would first investigate that he is not sick. If he is alright bodily and mentally. Then think about it.|`|B24W8w43aa	He's stressed. Don't split up over that.|`|24858b655af419324c43251eb8993fd9aa	he's a childish,immature, self-righteous, self-centered man. if he wants to leave...LET HIM GO. He thinks the grass is greener elsewhere, but he'll still have to mow,cut and water it. then when the leaves fall, he'll have A LOT to rake up. he's a kid.|`|M32eLpe6aa	he is probably embarrased because of his over reacting so now hes sticking to his pride because hes not going to admit that he blew a fuse. So just let him go give him a while and he will come back|`|jAQVFrvOaa	His feelings were hurt because he didnt do good on the steak, so dont say bye jus let him leave. he'll cool off and come 2 his senses but dont say goodbye it may jus make it worst.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	What the hell?? that's sooo weird! ask him what's wrong with him and why is he doing this to you. He's behavior is really strange.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Let him leave. He was looking for an out if that's all it took to set him off.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	LEt him leave..|`|iPFUJXvpaa	sounds like you don't care about him, so what is the deference.,,,,

4EWCegiRaa	I encourage people to do what's right for them and appreciate waiting until marriage.  HOWEVER, I feel like purity rings are a poor choice.  By wearing a purity ring, you're saying "My decision to wait until marriage defines me".|`|6MSmvWubaa	go for it! :) i wouldnt have sex at your ages anyways. but if you ever decide to have sex then make sure you are protected :/
wpi36XBAaa	Whether the one who threw the bottle was the mother or the father of that baby, it was such an irresponsible and dangerous thing to have done, I do agree that getting the child out of there was the top priority. <br>  The person who did that, (assuming it was done in temper, and not just out of stupidity/drunkenness) needs to work on how to handle their frustrations in a more mature way, so Anger Management Classes, and on going therapy is required before allowing the child back into that environment. <br>  If there's a problem with alcohol/alcoholism the that has to be addressed before allowing that parent contact with the child. Detox and a real commitment to AA and maybe the person can be allowed back in.<br>  Yes, it was a violent act, and yes, worse could happen if the person doesn't learn to get a handle on their problem. The child's safety MUST be the first priority.|`|AA11788494	It sounds like the one that left should have called the police and filed a protective order.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	Have the beer-thrower drink cans of beer instead of bottles. <br>  <br>  I feel bad for the baby and all, but how did your kids feel when they were subjected to this stuff? I hope the baby and the mature parent that can control their anger get out of there.|`|dVlLahozaa	yes that kind of behavior should not be allowed.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	well you raised him this way.  now you get to reap the benefits. good job.|`|s3Hr6b8Aaa	You are absolutely right! Girl, my mother stayed with my father because he had lots of money and five kids.  It was an absolutley abusive home. My dad beat us and my mom.  He use to throw hte remote and it would hit us.  There is no such thing as a broken home.  Its either a home or not...and a home sould be safe...where a child feels protected.  You need to take action and do something for tat baby!<br>  <br>  You might not want to be involved but do it...for god's sake...do it for the baby.  I have a 9 month old too.  They need love attention and care not be hit by a piece of a beer bottle.  The thign i'm scared of is that ...if the situation is the same this child may have emotional problems of his or her own and maybe abusive as an adult. This a nasty cycle.  basically - u are right that baby is not safe in that home at all! not now not ever!  these situations only get solved if the ppl in teh situation seek help/counseling by a professional.
302360c61aada74009ddb54cb7c95eedaa	Don't worry too much about it bro, you are still young and girls take time to figure out their sexuality unlike everyone here who knows what they are gonna major in at the age of 11.  Treat her like a princess not a lesbian and see what happens.  If she lets you know right away what she thinks is going on and refuses you then you have to look elsewhere.   If you figure out she's bi than weigh your options.  If it was me I would go for it all the way.  If you get shot down, f it, look somewhere else.|`|LKyGCaFQaa	I am in the same situation at my college, sadly I don't think there is anything that you can do. You can either not say anything and just go on being friends while it hurts, or tell her how you feel and remain friends and still have it hurt.  Sadly you must pick your poison.|`|DNOe4lD3aa	I think that if you care that much about her don't hold back give it all you got to get her and what ever you do don't let her forget you tell her you love her show her you love her the way you wrote this and if its meant to be she will love you to.|`|kBiCNu0Uaa	be friends w/ benfits jsut b/c shes a lezbo doens't mean that she doens't mind kissing guys she might bi if she is bi go for her but u cna't turn her straight i'm sorry no matter how hot/sexy u r|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	well if she says shes a legite lesbian just keep the friendship platonin, because as a lesbian myself we can be the best of friends to guys or anyone but as soon as you start crossing boundaries we asked you respect, friendship aborted and we lose respect for you<br>  <br>  however truth be told, i believe that if you truly like her and if you think she gives you signs back then you should go for it but take it very slow, DO NOT PUSH UP ON HER  let things develop<br>  <br>  you may never know, she could be a lesbian but somehow u could be the 1 guy shes interested in you know<br>  <br>  but over all dont ruin your friendship with her, and if she reminds you that shes gay once u hit on her, then call it quits because theirs your signal that shes not flirting shes just being nice <br>  <br>  and the "i miss u textes" lesbians, gay men, etc can send to anyone so dont think too much of it..<br>  <br>  maybe ur more into her because u simply want what you cant have, eiether way, theres plenty of girls out there soo good luck ;-)|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	if she is truely a lesbian they you need to move on because she will never change her sexual orientation|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	cut of your penis and get a strap on, then she will love you.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	She seems to be attracted to you. I don't know if it is just as friends, but, she kissed you, that should count for something. Has she ever dated guys? Will she consider it? She could be curious about you, and want to try it out. If not and she is set in her ways, you need to just be friends with her.|`|C5Ftdtl0aa	Sucks!  You should just give up on that ... unless you get a sex change nothing is gonna happen.  You're probably just obsessed with her because you can't have her. Sorry.|`|L5Z41RINaa	are you sure she is lesbian? mabey she is not? or both?|`|frj854Foaa	Look dude, if she kissed you she's bi, alright, now you cant change her opinion on how she looks at girls. But wat you can do is try to win her and convince her that being straight is better. Dude you cant change her, but you can convince her to make an exception and maybe she is tryin to act like a lesbo for attention. Has she kissed a girl if she has then shes a lesbo.
EJ3QLseqaa	just ask her out and then you'll have your answer
XELgscDsaa	talk to her about her being controlling first. of that does not change anything, then yes find someone new. sounds like she has some trust issues and I would not want to be with anyone with trust issues!|`|usDzPHVmaa	No, that shouldn't even be an option. Just because she doesn't want you to talk to other girls doesn't mean she's controlling. it's more than that, and if you can't see that, your stupid. she's self continuos about herself and when you talk to other girls, it makes her feel like she's not enough for you. If you break up with her, it's just going to make her think she really isn't good enough.|`|sItvaoXiaa	talk to her first to see whats up with her, some girls are like that, its probably because every other guy let her control them, but its not fair to you, so just try to discuss it with her, if she doesn't understand then start to consider breaking up with her.|`|rcwzIPE1aa	have a talk about it first; also, if she seems careless during the conversation, then dump her. that means she's careless about the relationship and take time to observe her reactions.|`|FhtlD8gNaa	Oh yes. Do it as soon as possible. Youre one of the lucky ones to get it so early. Most guys are with girls for a longer period of time then the girl becomes controlling. get out before you waste anymore of your time.|`|Jf7NRSINaa	UH YEA! if Ur girlfriend dosent let you do that, DUMP HER! it may hurt, but you will know that you have done the write thing! and if you feel really bad, find another girl, who is better!|`|D8ukWu82aa	yeah thats ridiculous. she shouldnt control your life. its okay to have theopposite sex as friends as long as you arent cheating|`|s0YeNdooaa	just ask her to stop. nicely... and if that doesn't work then i might...|`|f2hfuMKFaa	if its unbearable then yes, but really you have to decide that for yourself. Noone in yahoo answers knows your realtionship more than you so you have to ask yourself this question. You should make the right decision for you.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	I hate to say it, but I would|`|iR7StHksaa	let her know how you feel.<br>  if she accepts it then stay with her and if she doesnt tell her that you just want to be friends...you dint want to end a relationship in a bad way.|`|utIErJuPaa	yeah she sounds like she has trust issues and u probably didnt do anything wrong to deserve that <br>  <br>  plza answer mine <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304203659AA8MWRD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|GId5bF3iaa	talk to her abput it FIRST! then if it doesntchange, dump her.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	yes.|`|ActCDwzUaa	No just try to even out the playing field of the relationship. Show her how much you can be trusted. You two ought to have that down already but if you don't then you should work on that quick. Anyway tell her that she can't control the whole relationship. You have much control over it as she does. Just try to get her absolute trust and things ought to be easy from. There|`|E84iCYH2aa	Nope. Not righaway. Talk to her once before dumping her and try to figure out from where she got the feeling of insecurity about you? Is just that her fantasy or she had had a bad past which is making her insecure.<br>  <br>  If the case is 2nd one please be by her side and heal her up with your love and assurance. Even after all your desparate efforts she fails to let go of her dominance...then dump her|`|XLC3QDQ9aa	Does she talk to guys? If she can talk to guys and you can't talk to girls dump her. <br>  <br>  Either way if you don't want to be with someone who "lets" you talk to other females I say leave her now before it's too late, when she gets that mysterious pregnancy.<br>  <br>  RUN!|`|4QNdV64Xaa	dude u should not. if she talks to boys who are her friends, you should be able to talk to girls. let her know that she is a free spirit and you are the same. u 2 may talk to other people but u 2 are still together. good luck|`|HHERTudVaa	im sorry not to be mean but did u lose yer trust to talk to them? cuz i had that problem already. If not then id say dump her|`|vIPyklrFaa	talk to her about it. tell her how you feel. if she doesn't change, then unfortuantely, you may have to break up.|`|Cs6W9V3Baa	LOL,<br>  There is no should.  You will do as you like.|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	being a girl i would say yes dump her, when jealousy controls all.... it ruins things!!
3678a63c227fb95efdb295c02f4aa475aa	Up to you. Do you want to live in a controlling relationship or not. No one can make that decision for you.<br>  <br>  You will be going into it, though knowing how she is, and if you choose to stay you have no right to complain about it, as you chose.<br>  <br>  I would NEVER waste a second on someone who doesn't see me as an equal.
jxseTHg7aa	i like girls that are stylish, the have there own set style the combine mix and match and come out with something cool and original that is not to way out there.<br>  <br>  girls don't have to show a lot of skin, i like girls that that respect themselves and don't dress very revealing, showing off here and there is okay but don't over do it, mainly i like girls who try to impress you with their personality<br>  <br>  shoe don't really matter if i had to pick i would go with some vans of converse all stars<br>  <br>  glasses could go either way good or bad just not too big<br>  <br>  a little make up not too much maybe slight amount if blush, cover up, and eye liner<br>  <br>  someone with lighter skin but has a decent tan (just to an overdone tan till where the people look orange)<br>  <br>  I am a sucker for the eyes, the eyes are the gate way to the soul, plus pretty eyes have to go with a pretty face.<br>  <br>  chest and booty don't matter to much to me just as long as a girl has a decently slender body because she is in good shape and takes care of herself<br>  <br>  lastly something my mom would always tell me "all girls are beautiful" so dont let anyone tell you your not pretty <br>  <br>  hope this helped
FZKFLTyLaa	Simply state that you were kidding about sex and you thought you knew him well enough to know it was meant in fun. And that you had no intent to either lie to him or hurt him.
gBvD0fJAaa	sounds like you really like this lad.<br>  and to me it sounds like he likes you too<br>  but maybe not enough. dont think you should ask him out just yet<br>  try hanging out more, get to no each other outside of school.<br>  best of luck xxx
zY8uu241aa	Either your boyfriend's being an αss and trying to control you, or he has some major problems that you shouldn't have to deal with if you don't want to.  Call a suicide hotline for him (1-800-273-8255).  If he's faking it, he'll feel like the idiot he is.  If he's not, you've helped him and you get to move on.  Either way, go for the other guy.  You don't need your boyfriend putting that kind of pressure and guilt on you.|`|q5YB1RBMaa	That is a big deal,<br>  it sounds unhealthy, you should probably, call the suicide hotline.<br>  If he is telling the truth, this will help him, and if he is lying, it will totally humiliate him (which he would deserve)|`|KwQR3d5baa	Talk to your boyfriend about it.

How long have you been with him for him to say all that?|`|fgxajTiBaa	Your boyfriend is trying to control you by making you feel guilty. Most people do not actually follow through with this idle threat.<br>  <br>  If you're unhappy with your boyfriend, dump him. If you feel like he legitimately will try and commit suicide, talk to his friends and family about it. You should not be with someone because you feel guilty, end of story.
L0Quyt1Gaa	I never really had a mother who loved me, however the woman I live with is like a mother to be. When I lt her know how much I appreciate her or just let her know how I am doing, or tell her I love her, she enjoys it. She knows I love her.<br>  Try telling her, before you go to school or something Say bye, love you. Give her a hug. It should be simple, I mean she is your mother!<br>  Your mother is probably just afraid you don't love her anymore, let her know you do.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|QFEv8xSnaa	tell her how u really feeel|`|vW7lDdOiaa	The best thing you can do is just try to show it as much as possible. when you head to bed (if your at home) tell her you love her, or if you live on your own give her a call jsut to catch up. asking her about her day. just try to make her feel included in your life. and again tell her you love her as much as you can. And if you did just move out within the last year then your mother is probably feeling really alone right now and she needs all the comfort you can give to her.|`|ZTVr2V3xaa	It sounds like your mother needs you right now mabie now more than ever and even though you live a busy life you haft to find a way to make time for her just to show here that nomatter what life throws at you, you will always have time for her and include her. Its all about the little things. Have a girl day. seriously, take her out for dinner and a movie or lunch or go get your hair done IDK anything. Notes are good too, just leave her a little note laying around where you know she will find it saying your thinking about her and that you love her very much. It will work out, if you got a good mother there's nothing greater than that so please cherish the time that you have with her. Good Luck!|`|mAlvOFnWaa	Honestly, I would try having a heart to heart talk with her. Ask why she feels like you don't love her. If you don't think that will work, I would suggest trying to do something a little extra just for her every week/day. Or better yet, try to schedule some time just for you and your mom. It could be something as simple as watching a movie together, or going for a walk, or maybe out for Sunday brunch. She will appreciate some mother-daughter time. It's truly the little things in life that make a big difference. I hope that this helps you. Good luck!!|`|V5CRGK86aa	Sounds to me like there is something deeper than you just being busy. Have you ever done anything to hurt her emotionally or financially? A Mother generally won't say her children don't love her unless you have done something to hurt her or not trust you......|`|Fwv7uCGRaa	Try not to get smart with her, you know, don't get a tone and be ignorant. Also, you can try by taking your free time and doing things with her that she likes to do. Like watching movies w/ her, shopping, idk something that she would like.|`|mKBveDhHaa	say is there anything i can do to help . set the table for dinner, and clean up after yourself. ohh and wen she goes to bed say goodnight mom, sweetdreams. my mom loves wen i come in and say goodnight|`|Iy3zatGPaa	Tell her you love her everyday maybe spend some time with her instead of with friends once in a while. do soething on Mother's Day with her.|`|BnhOBmUeaa	mabey u did something wrong that made her mad mabey u should get her  something when ur free i always do that for my mom she blushes  just always let her know u will always love her that will make her happy too|`|Fxj2MdEBaa	Make her a gift- something home maid. Have a chat with her.|`|AA10495187	Help her around the house, obey her, and buy her flowers.|`|r9LnhUDqaa	she should know that you love her sometimes moms do that to make you feel guilty and have control over you|`|dRvz15nkaa	telling her should be enough.  she's the mom not you.  its usually the other way around...i think|`|flbQS3ZSaa	say i love you|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	sit her down and talk to her, tell her you love her with all your heart.. im sure she will understand if you explain you are really busy... its what mothers are good at!!... hope i helped! :)|`|ZELAqgG4aa	tell your mother that you love her, and that's it.. if she doesn't fell your love.. she's expecting more... you're only human after all. tell you mom that no matter what she thinks, you'll always love her...|`|vijNYZaIaa	one night when neither of you is busy pick a really good movie and spend some time together|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	tell her you love her, do something special, you might be busy but she might also be, take some of the stress of her head and help her around|`|IaK4SRHpaa	When your mom does something nice for you always try and remember to say thank you right away.  And when she takes care of you when you're sick give her a hug and say thanks.  Sometime we take it for granted when people do things for us.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I take it for granted when my husband does nice things for me like taking me out for dinner.  Or bringing me coffee and doughnuts home when he comes home late from work.  Your question helped to make me realize sometimes I take him for granted.  Just remember to say thank you and give her hugs now and then.  That would mean a lot to her to know that you appreciate what she does for you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're not feeling well.  Feel better!|`|kdSuwt8paa	It sounds as if she is feeling a bit down at the moment.    There are lots of ways to show her you love her.   Thank her for every little thing she does for you.   Offer to help her.    Enjoy your meals.   Above all talk to her.   Even if it is only a chat why you are clearing up after a meal.   Give her a hug when you are leaving the house in the morning.   If you are ill and she brings you something tell her you couldn't manage without her.    She needs a bit of positive reinforcement - so look for ways to show your appreciation in words and actions.|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	Well just telling her you love her and giving her a hug is not enough. Show her take time out of your studies to wash the dishes fold the Landry vacuum the living room.<br>  Or you can cook dinner for her.|`|GrBpDtqHaa	well make her a really nice gift,card and plan a super great day that both of you can do together,like take her out to do sumthing she likes. so that's the best i can do for ya|`|ww3ukbdVaa	tell her that and give her a hug.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	Your mom sounds a bit needy and maybe insecure.   Please don't take offense.<br>  The thing is if you have told your mom that you love her,  then that ought to be enough and you should not feel that you have to perform cartwheels to prove your love for her.   <br>  I take it you are a student and you are busy,   most parents understand that their kids have lives and even though us moms do get neglected sometimes,  it goes with the territory of being a mom and certainly is not an excuse to be mad with your child for not displaying affection.<br>  Just give your mom a hug and tell her you do love her and then leave it at that.    If that does not satisfy her,  I don't know what else to suggest other than maybe your mom has a problem.<br>  <br>  Love is not something to be demanded,  or make the other person to feel guilty about for not showing enough.    <br>  <br>  And for the record,  I hope she tells you and shows you plenty of love.<br>  It works both ways.|`|4KRSUhXLaa	Just tell her like you told everyone here. Like, "Mom I know I am not always the easiest kid to get along with, my room is a mess, I don't always listen to what you say, but I try to be the best son I know how to be. I am sorry for the times I am difficult. Growing up isn't easy but with your love and support I know I am growing into the kind of man you would be proud to call your son." Something along those lines. Write her what you feel even if it doesn't make sense to you it will to her. Good luck|`|YNd65b3kaa	It's normal for a child to love her parent  'silently'.   But you might be more observant on special occasions with cards and such and simply say, "I love you" every day.|`|Jph6y9viaa	joke with her and show your highest carisma to her|`|VZFEB85Iaa	Give her a hug or do some chores for her. :P|`|ergk5yLiaa	do something special for her|`|rHMQs5cSaa	make a special breakfast for her<br>  and tell her u luv her when u give to her!!!<br>  i do that alot|`|YhCPSYGzaa	Just tell her U luv her, that simple.
KWZdVwQ5aa	It can be stressful to be being told all this but you DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK.<br>  <br>  You do not legally or morally owe him anything. Good for you for moving somewhere else. Be independent and don't let anyone force you to do anything you don't want to do. <br>  <br>  If you need work you could offer to work for a paycheck, but it sounds like this boyfriend is not only stupid but is a real jerk.|`|LL95bMIlaa	The boyfriend can't do sh1t.<br>  Don't worry =)<br>  It's the mom who has control, but only for 2 more months.|`|eGSIXIsFaa	He has no legal right whatsoever to force you/him to return to your prior home, or to work for him. Not only is he not a blood relative/parent - he isn't even married to your/his mother.|`|lkX9RszWaa	No, legally the mom's boyfriend cannot do anything.  He is not a parent or legal guardian.  And he seems like kind of a dick.
oOD3dYaNaa	Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. =]<br>  Then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet.|`|KU3UG2NYaa	I think you should just go up to her and say hi or something. Or if you have a class and your doing work. ask her for some help. you can start that way. Never know till you try it ya know. There's no loss. Only a gain. hope i helped (:
sSrwcZb9aa	It depends on the kids - personally, I remember seeing everything form a neighbor cleaning fish to a sheep giving birth to a field-dressed deer hanging in a friend's barn to some friends' dogs mating to some other friends' family butchering sheep by the time I was a teenager, and non of it ever bothered me and I was fully aware of what was going on. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I think as long as the kids know what's going on, and know to stay a safe distance away, and are allowed to leave if they feel the need, they should be allowed to watch things like that whenever they have the desire to.|`|tWePoJYNaa	oh man! I would never bring my kids to that sort of thing. Animal torture?? Once kids know what the word castrate actually means and they can decide if going to such an event would interest them, then I'd think about it.|`|LL95bMIlaa	I'd say 10 years old.<br>  I'm 19, and honestly that sounds disturbing to me.|`|bdeymNvHaa	I don't think they should have been allowed to watch, especially since no one bothered to explain to the kids, what was going on (from what I can tell from your question).  <br>  <br>  I think if the kids lived on that ranch, and learning about some of these "facts of life" was just part of growing up there, it might not be so traumatic.  <br>  <br>  I think about age 10 - 12 kids could be told about this procedure and why it's being done, then let them choose whether to watch or not.
qoGov6Ewaa	dont be so pessimistic<br>  if youre picky go for what you want|`|w6DJj1a8aa	i think thats a smart thing to do!!!!! like i mean if you don't want to waste your time on someone you don't think you have a future with i mean you can talk to girls as friends but i understand why your like that though!!!! maybe i should do the same thing huh? lol =) hahaha

If things are hard you have two hands.|`|aZq2BX78aa	Im a 14 year old girl so I should be able to help.  First of all having a girlfriend isn't a big deal.  I'm sure you are a sweet guy and believe it or not girls don't only judge guys on how they look.  If getting girls to like you is important to you then I would suggest just trying to talk to someone you think you might like.  Try to get to know her and if she thinks you are nice then maybe she will start to like you no matter what you look like.  This doesn't just apply to loser girls either.  I'm pretty popular but I still like guys who aren't in the same "popular" crowd as me.  The first thing you need to do though is learn to love yourself.  No girl...or anyone...is going to like you unless you like yourself.  Be confident.  Be nice.  Be flirty.  And go get 'em tiger!|`|NLgEu3YMaa	Ahhahahha you penis just not bigger enough yet at age 13 you will understand what i mean when you grow up girls need some one experienced who can show them good time any way it's to early for you now|`|xA2SRCT3aa	youre 13.. you dont need a girlfriend.<br>  <br>   maybe try sports? itll keep you in shape and girls LOVEE athletes

v3zx6zsIaa	No, it is not your fault, my guess is that everyone will eventually get over this mess and move on. Right now, you should probably be Switzerland(stay out of it) and just be nice to everyone.|`|a59vFP3laa	no its not your fault she started it. Bu ti read gemma's answer and i just wanted to say switzerland isnt always the best sometime you have to join the jews and put an end to hitler|`|RnQFwIuUaa	No, it's not your fault. It sounds like you guys are young. It's always a good idea to be nice to everybody. You can't make someone be nice, only tolerate her. If you are a nice girl and she starts rumors about you, they will wonder if she is out of her head. They will be on your side.
INJSpV4haa	Well, as a fellow foot guy I would recommend some preliminary steps prior to just going ahead and licking her feet.<br>  <br>  Take your time!<br>  <br>  Start off with offering her foot massages when you are watching TV together. It's the most natural thing in the world. You can then see how she feels about having her feet touched and massaged. Proceed slowly from there (I'm talking weeks here) to an ocassional kiss on her feet. Gauge her reactions. If she asks why you like her feet, respond with: "I like all of you, including your amazing feet."<br>  <br>  The key is go slow and do not surprise her.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|fV2SYj60aa	I'm personally not into the whole feet thing.  If you want to try it with your fiance but don't necessarily wanna ask her straight out, start by giving her lots of foot massages.  Everyone likes foot massages!  And then slowly start making the foot massages more and more sensual.  Like, give her a foot massage, and give them light kisses while slowly working up massaging her legs and more, if she's up for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NU5U75gWaa	personally i am so not in to it i hate feet but whatever its your thing nothing wrong with that i would say when You all are you know in the bedroom lights off doing your thing maybe just slowly move your way down to her feet and do it just a little at first don't go all out and scare te hell out of her but  if she likes it she will either not say anything or tell you "I LIKE THAT" if she doesn't she will probably be like "WHAT THE HELL R U DOING?" n e way good luck|`|qv25Q4aaaa	The best way to find out is to give her a foot massage one night.<br>  <br>  if she likes you touching and rubbing her feet, chances are she'll be understanding of you being more sensual with them.<br>  <br>  But make sure she's okay with it first, either by rubbing them, or asking her.<br>  <br>  some women have ticklish feet, and might not like it|`|oGbHyZR8aa	I think feet fetishes are really weird and it would def. turn me OFF.<br>  <br>  But everyone has different turn ons!<br>  <br>  Just talk to her about it! Be like "Have you ever heard of feet fetishes?" and see what she says.|`|lyuWTIo6aa	i dont think so i think the feet thing is umm..not soo i dont think your fiance would enjoy it..but thats how i personallyy feel she may be different|`|VfkyAUWuaa	I don't think girls will be aroused by this question.|`|VkpFImx4aa	Give her a foot massage, then just start sucking her toes. She won't mind once she feels it.|`|jRv6X2gIaa	THIS REALLY ISNT A SEXUAL QUESTION 4 ..<br>   REAL BUT SUM GIRLS DONT LIKE 4 <br>  <br>  THERE FEET TO BE EVEN SEEN ..|`|JeUZKSQ3aa	I personally feel like it would be awkward if you played with her feet like that. It reminds me of a dog:/|`|VCX7S3d6aa	Sorry thats a No No !|`|08yhGTxZaa	yuck! i hate feet and girls are normaly verry selfconcious about there feet so im ganna have to say NO!|`|50OVH54iaa	I wouldn't like it..no offense, but some women do. Ask her, I'm sure she'll be open to a suggestion!|`|unm6d3q8aa	ha ew?! why would you wanna play with a ladiez feet?...choose a more sensitive and sexy part of her body ;)<br>  idk..it depends on your fianc'e cuz..she might not like it|`|381c7525bc309a1e29d4b3cf281f8a47aa	i would dis like it|`|4CmiMaclaa	eeeewwww um..... NO|`|LcweeMrLaa	While I'm not aroused by this question, I would like to offer some advice.  If this foot thing is as important to you as your girl is, go for it!  Ask her even if you feel silly because sexual compatibility is crucial!  Or, sneak it into play somehow and ask her what she thinks of it later on.  Talking about sex in an extremely candid way has helped my husband and I immesely.<br>  <br>  Blessings :)|`|kfGVk4Dnaa	lol this is a really awkward question..  <br>  and i think it really depends on your girl.<br>  cause honestly i like the whole feet thing its sexy but not many girls do.. <br>  you should really try to play with them before hand to make sure she likes it..|`|3rqd6N29aa	try it out dude. <br>  <br>  I HATED feet for so long, then i got a massage.. then came the licking, and now.. WOOOO =]<br>  <br>  i love it. <br>  <br>  it feels freakin awesome.  just make sure they are clean!|`|yMD7z1LKaa	Hmm good question.<br>  ://|`|5H64mGX1aa	toe sucking doesnt turn me on.<br>  good luck!!!<br>  lol<br>  <br>  wow wat a fetish...|`|x1Eg0ayBaa	thats nasty sorry but i doubt that she will like it it might tickle but that is nasty|`|YPlIGKbyaa	umm definitly NOT   do not do that  personally i would hate it|`|KwQR3d5baa	You have a fetish, what if she has it too?<br>  <br>  Just talk to her about it first|`|hXehbPVqaa	dont lick her feet! turn off|`|mo7ldnCxaa	Yeah honestly i dont think she would like it. to me it might be kinda embarassing. im sorry but that was a stupid idea.|`|1XcTZRemaa	Er, well, no, that'd be weird - at least for me. <br>  <br>  But hey, everyone has their own personal opinion. I'm not entirely sure how you can get your fiancee to let you play/lick with her feet, but you could always just gently get her to get on her back and then do it a little bit first, and see what her reaction is?|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Some girls are into that.. but I'm definitely not. I'd say only about 5% of women like to have men touching/licking their feet.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	umm eww gross im going to barf<br>  im sorry that this sounds immature but i seriously think that that is just ughhhh!|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	NO EW BLECH UGH EW|`|apUkTo3maa	I WOULD NOT LIKE MY FEET LICK OR PLAYED WITH???|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	I wouldn't like it.. but my feet are really ticklish so it wouldn't turn me on, it would just make me laugh.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	I believe that is a fetish you have.  I for one would not in any way, shape or form be aroused by someone playing or licking my feet.  That just doesn't turn me on.  It's more for people with a fetish.|`|lv26Oy3waa	play with maybe. but definitely not lick. yuck.|`|3DeAXh8jaa	How weird lol no, do not lick her feet and stuff. She wont want to kiss you after lmao TOE JAM|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	thats disgusting..she might not like the lickin part and arent you afraid her feet mite taste bad|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	I wouldn't mind I have something odd about me that I like too so I wnderstand how that goes just tell her, she won't care|`|3vnayfR7aa	No... please don't that's awkward...|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I wouldn't like it. I would rather have a guy give me oral.|`|Hek7MUNYaa	lol i thinks its cute and very romantic <br>  <br>  i am shy.....so i might find that very embezzling lol
AA10061044	no it's ok, don't worry. i used to be in the same situation.. <br>  u should not feel left out, u know. supposed to feel happy for them.<br>  perhaps u don't need to be so happy that they're together without u.<br>  <br>  as long as u do not find another friend to hangout with and let your 2 friends jealous or something like that. because it will be a selfish act. i hope u can imagine how terrible your threesome relationship will be. <br>  <br>  just be positive. you guys are all friends at the end. n friends don't mind those things, right?<br>  <br>  cheer up! :)<br>  <br>  PS: btw have u read the CHICKEN SOUP book? it's great, especially will get u understand better in friendship|`|0iGR3wuVaa	fdgdfg|`|y2X1j7cAaa	idk|`|wnBkuzpzaa	well, for one, if you guys are going to hang out, invite another friend of all you guys, so that you have someone to turn to if your other friends are shutting you out. But if you don't feel comfortable inviting someone else, next time they leave you out, just jokingly be like "Hey, don't forget about me!" they'll laugh, thinking it was a joke, but it will also draw the attention back to you.
3c2d62279c0725273058507451c39522aa	DO NOT keep sleeping with him. <br>  <br>  Be polite and nice to him, but stay away from him. Go out with your friends, do things that you enjoy. DO NOT sleep with him.<br>  <br>  Sleeping with him will not bring him back....sleeping with him will make him realize that hey he can sleep with you AND date other girls.<br>  <br>  You obviously want him back so don't put yourself through that pain. If you start doing your own thing and not initiating conversations with him, then hey maybe he'll realize he misses you. He is NOT going to miss you if you sleep with him while you're broken up.|`|gFwD0yeCaa	Sounds like he just wants sex from you. Which isn't bad, as long as that's what you want too. Figure out what you both want. If it's just sex, then keep having sex. If you want a relationship and he doesn't, it's time to cut him off. You  both need to get your feelings out on the table before you have sex again though. With my last two ex's I had sex with them for about a month after the break up. It's good closure, just gotta keep feelings out of it.|`|mL07N3IAaa	well if you two really love each other and keep sleeping with each other, it could be easier to get back into a relationship when you two are ready!|`|9Cbxuka9aa	I definently would NOT sleep with him again. Sounds like you're just a booty call. And sounds like he's calling the shots. He's just using you for fun until he meets the next girl he wants to be in a relationship with, who probably won't be you.
V8Fpgd9maa	I know this may be corny, but I like a girl who i can just gaze into her eyes.<br>  <br>  I think it's really romantic, and kinda intimate, if you can just look in to the eyes of the person you love.|`|CzIaAnsraa	<a href="http://digilander.libero.it/alberanid/cm/misc/spongebob.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://digilander.libero.it/alberanid/cm...</a>|`|rPcHPYN3aa	Face, hair breasts, @ss.

Her eyes...They tell me how she's feeling, tells her emotions, helps me seem to connect to her more...They say eyes are a gateway to the soul, I agree. I like girls eye's because they help me see who she really is past all the things she does to try and make herself seem pretty...Truth is, the real her is the most beautiful part. But I really just love to talk to girls...I like to talk to them, help them if they need it, ask for help if I need it...I cannot explain...The soul expresses what words cannot.|`|L5Z41RINaa	its very hard to say...it all depends. but the first thing is the butt. if its okay then i could come up to her and ask her out or start a convo. if there is no butt, i would never come up|`|raKcYQJMaa	Studies show men are most attracted to the female's butt, but i myself are a boobies man|`|UwzjGN1aaa	Sense of humor and confidence.

Getting sexed up by a bunch of different dudes, or having friends.  I've seen this before with girls who don't have friends except for with the guy she is doing at the moment, then it takes years to build friendships, real friendships.  Don't get this reputation, stop now, you can still hook up without being a dirty girl, friends are more important, they stay with you almost as long as Herpes.|`|oGbHyZR8aa	If you mean dirty as in hygiene, take a shower.

You need to ask yourself why is it that your jealous when she wants to go out with her friends? Do you think she's going to cheat? Do you resent the fact that she would rather be with her friends instead of you? Whatever it may be you need to figure that out and take the next step of relaxing. So she wants a little freedom don't we all? Let her have it the more you get mad the more she's thriving off of that. You need to pretend you don't care and then she'll stop doing it so much. If she goes out with her friends hey cool whatever then go hook up with yours. Just relax and breath and keep your mind occupied when she does go out, because that's whats making you so crazy. Don't sit and wait for her to get back go out there and have fun yourself.|`|S3uLASLnaa	If you truly love her, then you should trust her, dont  isolate her from everyone else or you'll end up pushing her away from you.|`|nuyWduwqaa	You need to seek therapy (seriously)...<br>  <br>  You are far too protective of her, and you are nurturing her far too much (and nobody appreciates that).
AleWgjvPaa	There is no easy way to break up with someone. Especially if he likes you as much as it sounds like. Just be honest with him about why you want to break up with him, don't try to be subtle or vague, that will hurt him more. Sometimes your feelings just don't last. It sucks but it happens. He will be heart-broken but over time he'll move on.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't stay with him just because you feel sorry for him. And don't get back together with him because you feel sorry for him. That will be a huge mistake and you will regret it.|`|twVyisGnaa	Breaking up with him will be hard, but if you really feel that you have to do it, you gotta do it.  You're just gotta tell him the correct reason why you don't like him, and I don't mean because of his negative qualities.  You have to just tell him what it is you're feeling, hat you stopped liking him and stuff.  If you still care about this dude, at least offer to be his best friend or something.  That will be a lot better for him than nothing.  I wish you and your bf the best of luck.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!

And have you TALKED TO HIM about this? Because frankly, your not in the relationship with us, your in a relationship with him. And your not being stupid/immature. You just need to see how he feels about it. Maybe he wants the magic back and doesn't know how to bring it up. Because if he brought it up, then you might jump to the conclusion that he thinks its your fault. Have an open, honest CALM conversation with him about it, in person.
IyvUC47Paa	lmao ^|`|9GUZzm5Saa	Finding That Elusive G-Spot<br>  <br>  A G-spot on a woman is not easy to find, but once you do you can give her great pleasure and intense orgasms. When your partner is lying on her back you can find the G-spot located around 1.5” inside the vagina on the vagina’s upper wall. The most intense orgasms can come when a woman has her G-spot stimulated. <br>  <br>  The G-spot tends to have a different texture that the rest of the vagina, as it has ridges and is not as smooth. When the G-spot is aroused it can feel a bit spongy. If your partner has a G-spot orgasm you will know it, as she will be in heaven for a few minutes afterwards. It is defiantly beneficial for you to find your partner’s G-spot, as it will not only make her feel fantastic but she will thank you for it in reciprocal ways.<br>  <br>  Here is one G Spot technique that may bring your partner to ultimate bliss. Having your fingers around 2-3 inches inside her vagina move them in circles around the inside of the vagina. Keep firm and constant pressure on all the walls of the vagina while you are fingering her. You can add a bit more pressure near her stomach but make sure you do not break the steady circular rhythm. Stop rotating your fingers and keep your fingertips on the, generally ridged, area of her vagina, which is a little behind her pubic bone exerting pressure upwards towards her stomach. This is direct stimulation of the G-spot and it tends to feel best for your partner when your fingers are moving about in a subtle and not jerky manner. Depending on what feels better for her you can either move your fingers in slow circles or keep your fingers pointed and keep them rolling back and forth over the G-spot. You can tell by her body language what area feels the best and what motion feels the best. But it also never hurts to ask, as the better you are at communication in the sack the more likely you are to find out where her erogenous zones, in this case the G-spot, are.<br>  <br>  A more advanced technique of G-spot stimulation is combining the two finger motions listed just above. Using your fingers you can trace the inside of her vagina while moving in and out of it. You have to be sure that the ends of your finger are always going over the G-spot after each rotation of your fingers, as this will give it constant stimulation and may build up to an intense orgasm. You have to find the rhythm and technique that gives her the most pleasure and when you have found it she will definitely be glad you did.<br>  <br>  When you move to intercourse try to use the angle and position where her G-spot will still be stimulated. If you stimulate the G-spot during intercourse it will make it more likely that she can reach orgasm.|`|4AHGY6jnaa	oooooooohhh. you ganna take that!?!

KXCZzFpzaa	If you're asking on here, I'm guessing you're somewhat new at this. There are only 3 things that could ever make this happen: 1. He's too drunk 2. He has to urinate or 3. A mental block, his mind isn't letting his body do it because of some underlying reason. Chances are he's just too nervous, but if he's doing something he really doesn't want to, it could happen for that reason too. Reassure him to relax, if he's nervous it will be a wasted night.

But don't worry when the time comes you will find the right person but until than you should just have fun and don't look for it because most likely it's going to happen when you least expect it.

If y ou lose your temper and do something, say break something, you will regret it later of course.  And then the next time you get angry you will remember this and try to mentally control yourself a bit better.  Other things that help are a squeeze/stress ball, a punching bag, a room to yell in, or just plain cursing (that works for me!)|`|FtyLwqR5aa	first thing take 10 20 or even 30. breath in through your nose and out your mouth. get away from the situation till you can control your self if you can't do any of that then set off that toxic tnt.|`|XsBburttaa	The first thing You CAN NOT DO IS Be around ppl. when you're angry. If someone angered you, go and talk to them, confront them. If its just anger caused by something else, go to a place(a quiet place) and listen to a calming music, Give it 15-30 min. or more.

pg347WpRaa	Hey,<br>  Im 15 too and i'm pretty much in the same situation as you.<br>  I don't really see my virginity as anything to preserve, its not really important to me. Maybe it'll be different when I lose it, you know what they say - you never miss something until its gone.<br>  From what I've heard, sex is painful for the first few times. This is because the hymen is breaking and the vagina is stretching. After that its better.<br>  If you've done gymnastics, horseriding, lots of sports, use tampons or have been fingered then your hymen might have already broken so it won't hurt so much.<br>  Most people know when they've broken theirs because they will bleed but some never find out.. it may be because it coincided with their period or something..<br>  Anyways, I hope I helped.<br>  :)|`|7UKJY0v0aa	your virginity is your most valuable thing that you have. Dont loose it just cause you want to know what it feels like. Do it when you love someone for sure and then it will be amazing. I am not trying to tell you what to do but a little heads up, this year my friend (we are both freshman) was like telling me how shes totally ready to have sex and everything. I told her not to but she did anyway. Well no its been 4 months and shes pregnant. She is dropping out of school, her reputation at school is down the drain, and she never talks to anyone anymore. I never thought something like that could happen to someone so close to me...but it did. I hope nothing like that happens to you, but just know the consequences.<br>  <br>  <br>  xoxo best of luck to you|`|yj7Nndilaa	First I will say, you should save it for a long time, until you are with someone who is ready to deal with what sex may bring. Pregnancy, and you wont to avoid STD's. Be with someone who loves you and who you think will be there for you.<br>  <br>  Sex will hurt the first time. But after having it for a while it will be easier and if he knows how to please you, and cares about your pleasure it will be wonderful. But it doesn't just happen and it isn't like in the movies. The movies show this wonderful awesome perfect sex, but it is not like that all the time, and defiantly not like that at first. If you have played sports or even worn tampons and had them in too far, you won't bleed, that is how it was with me. I didn't bleed when i lost my virginity.|`|Uq6r7ukvaa	I know you are just kidding ryt|`|fAxVijQRaa	Uh, I don't know what country you live in, but if you're 15 it's illegal in some countires. <br>  Wait till it's legal, then wait till you find the right guy.

If you want to lose it for pleasure, I admire that but<br>  there are other ways to do that without risking getting pregnant.<br>  There is alot of things you can do to satisfy your needs without losing<br>  it.  Wanting to lose it just for the sake of losing it, I think its a dumb idea, because I think most guys would go after virgins, even though the girl can still be "experienced".<br>  <br>  But just to answer your question what does it feel like, it really depends on the guy you are with. If the guy only cares about himself, then he wont make the effort to please you, and if you are not doing it seeking pleasure, it will be all the more harder for it to feel good for you.  <br>  <br>  Personally I cant do my own thing without knowing that my partner is enjoying herself. but I have heard from my friends that their guys just came in them and they were left clueless, it happens alot so many girls are left unsatisfied and in pain.<br>  <br>  I would really suggest other methods of seeking pleasure.<br>  Intercourse is just a default, but if you get creative, you can<br>  find ways that will make you feel even better. Ways you can make sure<br>  that he is interested in your pleasure instead of just interested in getting off inside you.|`|uAKce1JSaa	it all depends. for some girls im told it really hurts them but for others it doesn't. it also depends on how you feel about the person was they can make you really wet making it easier to go in causing less pain or your not  so wet and it hurts. also depends on how tight you are or aren't for your first time. so you really wont know until you do it i guess|`|p8TTH1Zxaa	you should wait until you atleast have someone you love to do it with. You dont have to wait till your married but atleast try to wait past your freshman year. Oh and it hurts BAD your first time. It hardly feels good. So i say you wait. and dont let a guy take advantage of you because you will end up regretting it|`|Gjy4qj4zaa	ok im a virgin, but i heard that it hurts the first time. and that its not the greatest thing ever, but it gets better with time... at least thats what i heard. what can i say im 14 and i no how you feel. like i dont necessary wanna go and lose it but i no how u feel.|`|gjqnWvY2aa	Gurl u betta keep dat V-CARD cause anything can happen lets say u do have sex 4 da 1st time and as good as it may feel AND U GET A STD OR PREGNANT NOW WAT?!!!!!!!|`|AA11263103	why your just going regret it in later in life just one less regret.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	You are too young.<br>  <br>  Hang on to that virginity until you find someone who DOES love you and you are sure does not want you only for sex.<br>  <br>  It WILL feel so much better when you do.
6f5c461596d36223a4de1ff50d1fe3c1aa	Sit down with him face to face and ask him if everything is ok with the 2 of you. Don't cry, be strong, most of all be calm! If he ask for some space say ok, get up grab your coat and calmly walk out. Don't call him, let him call you first. If time passes and you don't hear from him maybe call him, say, like if you have an upcoming doctors appointment and ask if he would like to go with you.|`|qcIfCt5haa	just give him space for right now and if he really wants to be with you then he will come back to you. i mean he should deffinatly help with the baby, but if you two aren't meant to be together don't think you have to stay with him bc of your baby, if you are not happy then your baby won't be happy|`|FQK4jSk3aa	Just let him know you're there and give him some space. If he really wants this to work, he'll call and if he doesn't well, he's an *** (no offense)|`|kQgSi1MEaa	holy sh*t, is your period button working? <br>  <br>  <br>  thats just one huge run-on jumble of letters|`|E84iCYH2aa	So the pregnancy happened without the relationship having a serious base? Neither were you ready for it nor was your bf...I dont see much of future in the relationship and my thought process tells me that he is now trying to avoid the forthcoming responsibility of fathering a child.<br>  <br>  However are you sure that you can pull the pregnancy through without him by his side? Do you have your family or your friends by your side in the whole episode of pregnancy and motherhood If not then expect the worst and prepare yourself to face all the challenges ahead of a single mother. <br>  <br>  Would suggest not to call him back ever. If he sees a future in it, he'll call you back. Else just forget him, pull the pregnancy through with the help of your near ones and all the best ahead|`|j8JgSRTnaa	dont call him im sure he will call you if you call him it will make it seem like your sedperate im sure he'll be wanting you to call him but DONT!! bc he WILL call you maybe not tonight but im sure by tomorrow night at least|`|dm1Iy6koaa	help me,ill give you 10 points<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApqL0KP4E1TLimzrtIDLIOPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304195655AAG0eAy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|YCwuzV52aa	No you shouldn't be worrying because he should be the one waiting on you hand and foot since your having his kid. He shouldn.t be doing anything to mess up your relationship.Don't stress it. He needs to get his self together.The next time you talk to him tou should give him a piece of your mind.Let him know what your thinking and how you feel.Tell him that he needs to get his priorties straight!|`|m8f7rnBEaa	Grim.  Another one bites the dust.
AA12195891	Leave him immediately and if you can get your parents or friends to help, try to talk to a lawyer about custody and visitation rights now.  I understand how you feel - you feel like he has a right to be with his child and you should be understanding of the stresses in his life.  What you need to feel confident in is that he doesn't get entitled to his rights - he has to earn them.  A woman spends 9-10 months of physical work allowing this wonderful creature to grow in her - if he can't spend 30 minutes a day checking to make sure you are ok, what makes you think he'll be a good father when the baby is born?  <br>  <br>  I think you are truly a sweetheart for keeping the baby and my guess is that you'll be a very warm and nurturing mom - your baby is very lucky to have you.  I think the hardest decisions you'll have to make as a mother are about who and what you want your baby to be with.  Its not selfish of you to make those decisions - your baby needs you to be the strong one making those decisions.<br>  <br>  If the boyfriend can't get his act together, you are not being selfish to protect your baby from him.  Your baby deserves a parent who's got their act together and will have love to offer them 24 hrs a day.  If this guy can't be that kind of parent, then I think you need to do what you need to do for the baby's best interest.<br>  <br>  By the way, I don't think you should break up with him alone - have a friend or parent there for support.  This isn't something you should have to have all on your own shoulders.  Let the boyfriend know that you have a support network and that you don't need him - otherwise he'll just get angry at you.  Let him know there is a gang of people there for you and that he is totally unnecessarily for you.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck on your pregnancy - it'll be a lot of work for you, but really have you ever heard anyone not feel overjoyed about having a baby?  You're going to be an awesome mom - have fun and take care of yourself.
FbtEvsIGaa	what ever happened to honesty .i don't want to lose you as friend but i
wv9XWQqCaa	That's not true. Relationships are about love and mutual respect, not control. Keep the lines of communication open,and be willing to compromise.|`|kERP7zAhaa	yup. being strong is sexyyy|`|gFwD0yeCaa	I think both men and women should be on equal footing in a relationship, even if in different capacities. Decisions should be reached mutually instead of being wholly decided by one partner. That's why they're called partners.|`|j1ktGK3vaa	most definitely!
edX5g93raa	Nope if shes being a ***** to you and your friend cause of being childish then she is a bad person to have a relationship with|`|9vtXlIUBaa	I don't really understand your question.. try re-wording it.|`|rPoKRm8gaa	I dont  really understand anything you said. But good luc,....? :)|`|GqJcEsImaa	Well don't just ask her out.<br>  That would be AWKWARD and desperate-like.<br>  Atleast tell her you like her and explain that you<br>  really WANT to ask her out but yr afraid that she'll<br>  use you.That will give her a chance to defend herself<br>  and tell you how she feels.But if you just ask her out<br>  without telling her whats on yr mind,you'll always be<br>  insecure in yr relationship and that almost always <br>  leads to breakups.<br>  <br>  :)Goooodluuuck.|`|SbbCOmEsaa	If you really truly like her then you should. She broke up with him for being an ***, so be nice and laid back so you can ask her out.
K4zsztkRaa	Well don't just do it because your doctor reccomended it. Make sure it's the right option for you. And if you want it go for it but make sure it's what YOU want, there are other options.<br>  <br>  I don't know ask her not me.<br>  <br>  -Connor
wv9XWQqCaa	I wouldn't ask her again, because it makes you look kinda desperate. She probably likes you as a friend, and is not willing to do anything to jeopardize that friendship.|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	ask her friends first, they'll know what's up. Ask them if you can ask her and if she will go with you|`|UrrRgmDwaa	If she already said no once I would approach with caution. I would definitely say no unless she is giving out major I'm into you signs. If she's just being friendly etc.. I wouldn't take that as into you. I mean super flirty, touchy, out of her way to get your attention, etc... Then, I might even try something less Yes or No than going to a dance. How about will you help me study or meet with a group of friends somewhere. This way she won't feel too pressured and you can feel her out first.|`|BV7ZRKpUaa	hmm it depends since you talk all the time...a guy asked me out and i hardly knew him and said no because i didnt know him but now i want him to ask me out again...i say go for it, might as well take the chance|`|fV2SYj60aa	Yeah, ask her to the dance, and if she turns you down, then you probably shouldn't ask her again.|`|yv3hBhbGaa	ask her to the dance if she says no again then dont ask her again.|`|xxyaYG0caa	i agree probly go 2 her freinds but u can ask her 2 the dance, if she likes u shell say yes if she doesnt shell say no, if she says no dont ask again cuz ull look desperate and eventually she may say yes but only out of pity
wFOr6ip0aa	Ok, one way is to play a couple of games of hang man with her with the last answer is ''will you go to prom with me''?<br>  and another way is get some roses and make a small poem with the last lines asking her, and put the poem on the roses and leave them at her doorstep with her name on the front when you know she is home, then go somewhere where you can see her get it wait for a few and then call her and ask her " so will you?''|`|tWQreW6xaa	"Roses are red, violets are blue, i cant write poetry but i wanna go to the prom with you"<br>  <br>  Try asking that along side with something like roses, corny is the way its supposed to be lol, a lot of girls find it cute, just depends i guess.|`|CdfATc6Kaa	Do you play sports with her? If so then (if it involves a ball) Then throw the ball at her or something that says will you go to prom with me?<br>  <br>  Or You can buy here a little jewelry box playing a little lullaby with a little prom couple then put a poem in it that says something then at the end it will say unlace the ribbon or something. then have the ribbon ask or something|`|Xww9vGWPaa	(Do not try if you've only been dating a short while...)<br>  Leave an autographed photo of your butt on her pillow with the words "This could be yours..." and then the date of the dance. Worked for me.
RgymoiIQaa	Ok, first you need to know that there needs to be a perfect balance between head movement and saliva. You need to move your head the opposite way she moves hers. Not nose to nose. If she turns her head to the right turn your head to your right. Also, you can practice on your hand for the saliva issue. You don't want to give super wet kisses. So, practice on your hand kissing and not leaving a bunch of saliva. Also, watch out how much you use your tongue. Your tongue should not fully enter her mouth. Only like the tip of it just enough to touch hers, and bring it back out after a second or two. Maybe start with a simple peck like kiss, maybe let it linger for 5 seconds. Then work your way into some technique.|`|4CmiMaclaa	sentence 4 is so not true u are not pathetic|`|BV7ZRKpUaa	are you asking how to make out? its kind of hard to explain it just has to come naturally..same as a kiss
RDgyb7W8aa	Who knows, long distance relationships sometimes work out.  Keep in touch with him.|`|5H64mGX1aa	he likes you!<br>  go for it!<br>  but keep an eye on him---i spy a player!!!|`|cxytFfvKaa	thats creepy.. lol<br>  if hes serious you should stop talking to him
fMFHzByxaa	i would say that its wrong. I'm sure that she is really hurt by it, especially if you guys were friends with her before. i remember that my friends once did that to me and i was so hurt by them that it was hard to go to school from then on. if your friend doesn't want to talk to her anymore, she should at least say it to her face, alone in an understanding way so that the girl isn't embarrassed.
zzaScg0haa	Honestly if you like him ask him to hang out
4CmiMaclaa	ya nasty
jMRGnNjYaa	call him at night sometime and see what he's usually doing around that time, then start calling him around that time every time you call him... and text him during the day.|`|Joj7vRG8aa	sometimes we like to hear your voice but txting is more fun|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	no texting is cool, everyone does it trust me, hell think nothing of it..<br>  <br>  if possible find out if he has a phone with an actual key pad though like for ex: sidekick, black berry, g1 etc etc<br>  <br>  because if hes using like a regular flip using t9 then that is sooo annoying to have long convos through text<br>  <br>  anyway good luck;-)|`|pIkJVfAkaa	Definitely do both... If you 'know' for a fact he'll be busy...at work/in school then send him a text... however, if you're not sure if he's busy or you know he's not at work/school def give him a buzz.|`|BV7ZRKpUaa	nahh textings fine...its way less awkward than talking on the phone
8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	wow.  call your local women's shelter and tell them this story and ask them what they think. <br>  <br>  They will tell you that every single woman in that shelter has had this exact same experience.  Unless you want to end up in:<br>  1. the morgue<br>  2. court looking for a restraining order<br>  3.  hiding in some new city trying to get away from him and always looking over your shoulder<br>  4.  hiding and crying in your closet some night when your parents are out because you know he's coming for you<br>  <br>  GET AWAY FROM HIM NOW AND NEVER HAVE CONTACT WITH HIM AGAIN!!!<br>  <br>  Look, it might not seem THAT bad not, but this is a very classic behavior pattern.  This is the story of all abused women.  GET AWAY FROM HIM!!!|`|kjdKkDAkaa	This can only get worse.  End the relationship with this guy before you get hurt.|`|UiypInBVaa	GET RID OF HIM, he's no good, if he's going to try to control you or the situation, you HAVE to get out of it, its not good for you if you don't<br>  <br>  good luck. <br>  <br>  I would say letter b|`|5deoyRdYaa	Can you say control freak? Some people are so insecure that they feel if they can control who they are with everything is okay. This is unhealthy for him and you. I like your idea of telling him to cut the crap or give him his walking papers. Here is a fact, he is showing some really radical behavior. Do you think this will get better? If you know he is jealous and you can't deal with it what other choice is there but to part ways?<br>  In his defense, if he is already jealous and he sees you spending a lot of time around the other guy that just adds fuel to his inner fire. Maybe it would make him feel better if Ryan had a gf and seen them together with you present. <br>  Just remember that if you are scared now with something so trivial concerning this guy, it can always get worse. Be safe and protect your future.|`|M7xZgEdbaa	Tell him that if he trusts you so much he shouldnt be pulling this crap and tell him not to let it happen again or its over.

WMR8hVlfaa	Wow, you sound mature. I suggest you break it off and wait until you've grown some before you get into a relationship because you are obviously not ready.|`|uUrJwk7Faa	Grow up. The ideal relationship is secure and equal.|`|3b303945f40f083a0a27c9df49f6a262aa	You can't.<br>  The truth is that women already have the upper hand in a relationship. However, men can learn how to contradict this, especially from dating books and sites.<br>  I know that I control all my relationships because of this, but the truth is, its best not to be in control too much. If you are in control, then what good can come of it? Just hand the lead off once in a while, and things will go out all right.|`|7MxJVtbYaa	im in your exact same shoes just the other way around my girl controls most of the realtionship and she is always leaving me with i want more. pretty good tactic i think. well she usually blackmails me, example. i have something she really wants to read. so she says give it to me with a real sad face on and then says give it to me or else i wont kiss you. always works because i really want to kiss her. just dont do that if hes abusive or else he might just get what he wants by hurting.|`|QgYU4Iz5aa	trust me, you don't want this. As soon as you have him around your little finger you'll get bored and dump him.|`|w4l8NajJaa	ummmm i woudlnt know
779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	if you don't let her go out with her friends, she will resent you for it. you can't control her every move, and they are her friends. there's no reason that you should be stopping her.|`|AA10928214	yeah, why wouldnt you want her to do what she wants, as long as she is being faithful. that's why I love my boyfriend so much, he lets me do my thing, and i always go back to him,<br>  would you want her to tell you that you couldnt go hang out with youre friends?|`|cxytFfvKaa	man your not the boss of her of course she can go out.. my bf goes to the bar without me cuz im not of age yet and i go to tons of parties without him. put a little faith and have some trust in your girl! geez
Joj7vRG8aa	show her more attention than the other girls when shes around u with the other girls hold her it makes her feel like shes more important to you than anyone else
JhvqUvlsaa	Lol he's not going to viciously attack you. =) All first, second, and third kisses are awkward; just relax and open your mouth just a little. When your lips touch his, get the feel of it and go from there. If it's tender you'll know what to do.<br>  <br>  It's not weird that it took you off gaurd; this is all new to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
18Voe39yaa	date him NOW! it's you best chance since you just met.
DSo3cUjeaa	You need to accept the fact that everything happens for a reason. Besides you are in high school. It is more likely that you will not end up together anyway. Not trying to be rude. But as each of you gets older you may grow apart. Don't plan your life while you are still in high school, that you want to be with him forever. If it's meant to be then it will happen. If not you have to accept it and move on. Depression and therapy over a high school relationship is ridiculous. Are you going to college? Is he? What if you don't or can't go to the same college? Also, what if some new guy comes along and sweeps you off your feet. Probably hard to imagine right now. But it very well could, you never know.|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Talk every night on the phone and keep in contact.  You can still go tothe movies and everything but now it gives you a chance to meet new friends.  At least he's still near you.  But I know how you feel...my best friends moved across the country and I was devastated at first but I've learned to move on and we still keep in contact all the time.  Just don't forget about each other and you will be fine.
lHK13vqwaa	there is no telling. maybe he did like you, then thought you didn't like him so he moved on? talk to him more, or catch his eye. good luck =)|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	hmm..maybe he noticed you? you're prolly real pretty so he can't stop looking. :]|`|JT7RLREBaa	He probably noticed that you noticed lol he doesnt wanna come off as a creeper. Or you may not wanna hear this but you could just be thinking that he was looking at u when he wasnt because u like him so much :/<br>  idk its hard to say<br>  talk to him! good luck

OR she is cheating on you, if you aren't on her that is. OR one or both of you two got fatter and there is no physical love anymore. Have you even talked to her about this lost 'spice'. Talking is hard for a guy to do, I'm sure, but you'll never actually know anything unless you open your mouth and ask! Having a good communication between two people can make up for what was lost and could possibly bring you two closer together. Ask her what some of her fantasies are or what turns her on. You could tell her a few things too, but remember to PAY ATTENTION and listen to her. Acknowledge what she is telling you. Try rubbing her leg to try and get the mood going while your talking. just not too much or she'll just think your horny or something. lol. All I gotta say is, talk to her. communication is number 1 in a relationship.|`|N5yikY3Naa	Wow two years then you need to make little special candle light dinners for two get the communication going enjoy the time that yall have together talk about when yall first meet. Just show her that she not a piece of nothing show her that you still enjoy the sex that yall create together make her feel new and wanted and hopefully that should bring the spice back.|`|AA12189962	it is quite natural.

OmzJq7EIaa	Yes, you should apologize.  If you don't apologize, how is she supposed to know that you didn't mean what you said? <br>  <br>  I understand people get angry and say things they don't mean, but have you done anything to "take back" what you said, and make it clear that she means a lot to you? It is kind of weird that she straight up asks for an apology, but I do have to say it sounds like you owe her one.  Depending on the circumstances, she may owe you one also.  She probably overreacted to your interaction with her friends, but girls can be very insecure, does she have any self-esteem or jealousy issues?<br>  <br>  I don't know what her deal is, but if she means as much as you say she does and you want to be with her, you need to make it clear somehow that your words were spoken in anger. As with most fights couples have,  I would likely say you both owe each other an apology but you do need to make it clear how much she means to you.|`|tWQreW6xaa	Hmmmm if you dont want to lose her, you might want to apologize, i dont know what kind of girl she is, but some girls when you tell them stuff like that they get really upset, so if it was me in the situation, i would just have a talk with her, and talk things over about what happened, and that stupid mistakes were made.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|T7HuKzZcaa	trust me. just apologize. even if you have not done anything wrong, apologize.  you can never apologize enough to a woman.   in fact, you should apologize in advance for stupid things you may do in the future|`|lqQyFXEmaa	if i were her, i would definentaly want an apology, no matter what happened.<br>  it will make her feel better, and if you wanna put a smile on her face again, go for it(:|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	yes you should have apologized not for not paying attention to her but just for the hurtful words that you said to her so she knows that you didn't mean it|`|RnQFwIuUaa	It's ok to have disagreements, but, if you say hurtful things, you need to apologize. I'm sure she will be sorry for the things she said, but you went for the gut and turned the knife. Do you not give her enough attention or dote on her? Maybe you need to reevaluate you behavior because sometimes we don't see what others see.
zzaScg0haa	Honestly if you aren't as into him as he is to you the best thing to do would just be to let him go

The situation you're describing is one of many that he has been trained to deal with, has dealt with and will most likely do so in the very near future. He is not the first boy or girl to begin straying from the flock. Remember the prodigal son???<br>  <br>  Second serious question, am I to understand that you haven't had 'the talk' with him yet? He's 17! Yes, I do grant that he may have been to and taught at the church services for youths. Unless your church doesn't offer one.<br>  And if they don't have a youth pastor, NOW is the definitive time for You to Be the Man God demands of you!  Sit him down with a teen guidance book and go through it thoroughly with him...NOW.<br>  <br>  As for the rag with nude men? Destroy it!!! Let the rants happen, it's his soul you are saving! You are the Father, the Head of the house, the Leader, Protector, Provider, Prayer Warrior...You Know what has to be done...Do IT!<br>  <br>  Is he having sex? that's a no-brainer. With who? Doesn't matter. You & he can deal with that part together. It may be very difficult to totally comprehend yet he Wants You to Be the Man.

NOW!<br>  <br>  Most every single teenager rebels against their parents. They're testing them! We both read the questions posted here, the themes are about the same. Including those asking How to lie, cheat, steal, manipulate or overpower their Mom & Dad!

dFHsAXDMaa	You know what sweety your daddy loves you more anything in the world.. he just worries about his little girl who is growing up becoming  a young women. He worries about everything boys, you leaving in a few years and going to college... and he wishes he spent more time with you instead of all those hours he spent working... he lays in bed at night asking himself how did you grow up so fast and how much he misses his little girl. Try hanging out with him or asking him if just the two of you can hang out and do something over the weekend. He loves you always remember that|`|bdeymNvHaa	Maybe you can start off by getting to know him.  Ask him how his day was at work.  Ask if he likes his job and what he likes/dislikes about it.  Is that what he wanted to do when he was younger?  How did he get along with his parents/siblings/relatives.<br>  <br>  These answers could give you some insight to what is going on with your father. Maybe he'll start asking you questions and learn about you, too.  <br>  <br>  Do you play softball or basketball or any sport or game he might be interested in?  I think a lot of dads leave the parenting to mom until their kids are grown.  Some were raised to think they should provide the financial aspect of parenting and others may not have had a relationship with their parents so they may not know where to start.  <br>  <br>  It's great you are asking this question.  Good luck and let me know how it turns out, ok?  :-)|`|FEKf1Lzlaa	It's just a phase, try to keep the peace for now as best you can.  You have to realize that you're his little girl, and you're growing up.  That can be a difficult thing to deal with.  You have to realize that one day the two of you are playing tag or 'tickle monster' and then it seems like the next you're grown up worried about boys and make-up.  It's a hard transition for a dad to make, it'll be rough for a few years, but eventually he'll come around.  Hang in there!|`|Deb4iqbvaa	I'm sorry that you're arguing with your Dad. Sounds like he is sad that his little girl is growing up so fast. Ask him to teach you something, like how to change a tire or how to throw a football so it spirals. <br>  <br>  Dads like teaching their kids new things, and you guys will be spending time together so that's great.|`|Fxj2MdEBaa	just give it time. take it step bi step. make small conversations to eventually get into a larger one. compliment him or just tell him face to face tht ur upset u guys always fight.

1Q9D7pzAaa	Well he could possibly like you. I had this same problem when I was in high school. I could only figure it out by asking him. I walked up to him one day after class and asked him straight out, "Do you like me?" He ended up saying no. But anyway i got the problem cleared up. He may be giving you a little more attention because your first laungauge is french in the first place.|`|E7TkNO00aa	It could be both. Maye he is just trying to be polite to you or maybe he is interested in you. Keep in mind, teachers and students, don't mix.|`|o4Opbzh0aa	In my experience, I've had many teachers, of language and music and dance.. I notice that when a teacher is pleased with a student that is doing particularly well in whatever subject is being taught, the teacher generally tends to treat the student like your french teacher is behaving towards you. <br>  However I don't know exactly what vibes you are getting from him so I could be wrong, but my impression is that most teachers treat their favorite students exactly the way you described. Whether or not his affection has reached beyond the typical between a teacher and his favorite student, I have no idea. <br>  =) But could always start dropping little signals if you like him to see how he responds ;]|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	hahahahhahaha<br>  <br>  nooo I dont think soo,,<br>  <br>  french men specially teachers are quite ''flirty'' ''they smile with their eyes'' in a kinda pervy way..<br>  <br>  all my past 3 french T.. were like that,, he began to like u more cuz u are smart,, cuz he thought u weren't before...<br>  <br>  Its quite noraml,, not the french teacher thing,, I mean almost ALL teacher will like u more when they find out that u are ''smart'',,, <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  <br>  One theacher acsully transferd me to another class cuz she thought I were dumb, cuz i'm quite lazy and her classes were in the moring so I woulden;t go, <br>  <br>  but then we did this test and I went and did it, and got higest score,, she later transferd me back, I think cuz she only wants ''smart'' kids in her class so she will look like a good teacher,, ( cuz those lessons worde divided in 3 groups with different teachers,)<br>  <br>  Anyway back to your Q,, ya its quite normal...
2eGMXYaIaa	I think you are a little self-centered.  Is a guy suppose to say "oh wow she gets good grades, is president, and in leadership," that's exactly what I want in a girl.  You have to think about personality, and if they have a problem with your weight then you shouldn't want to be with them.  You saw guys are intimidated by you, some guys are no good for you, and you blow them off.   You are acting like you are too good for them by saying that and listing the extra curricular activities you do.  If I was a guy I wouldn't want to be with you not because you are BBW, but because you sound conceited.

HIpf0a0Haa	you should just be your self. it might seem right following the 'IN' crowd, but it will end with you being excluded because you seem fake.<br>  And it doesn't matter if you have the exact same interests as some one else. if every one did the same thing, we'd all wear the same colors and be worried about our weight constantly. <br>  And if your Friends don't except you for what you like to do, then they aren't really your Friends. <br>  And when it comes to not eating in front of others, that's very common. you just aren't comfortable eating with who you are sitting with. so i would suggest trying to sit with a different group. <br>  good luck girl, high school is always hard for every one. just most people dont admit it.

C3qh54lgaa	Well, it all depends on what kind of girl she is; material, simple, wild, reserve...etc.  I would recommed talking to her on the phone and casualy ask her about little things she likes, and pay attention!  Women love this because so many men do not listen!  Tell her something like "wow, I need candy bar right now", or a beer, or what ever, then ask her what kind she likes.  Then bring her one(candy bar), on your date with a long stem rose.  Ask about her hobbies.

It's like, everytime i know that he is on the computer, all i can think that he is doing is hitting up on some other woman and trying to get lucky. <br>  and slowly but surely i'm working really hard ontryign to trust him again, and it was killing me, sitting there knowing that he was doing this ( some freinds told he was doing it) and i just had to sit down and talk with him, ask him, what he wanted! <br>  and i think that maybe thats what you need to do, is just sit down with him and ask him what he really wants, and you don't want to be there and with him if thats not what he wants. <br>  I know that you want to raise your kid with a mother and father, but you really don't want to raise your child where the mother and father aren't getting along! <br>  So i think that you just need to sit down and talk him and see what he wants and then just try to give him some trust. no trust can suffocate a relationship and ruin it.|`|u1eyI15Baa	Awww... well its probably not that he's not that into you.<br>  If he really wasnt, he wouldve just backed out.<br>  Try to go councelling with him and add more forgiveness, its really hard when someone is accused of cheating on his/her partner, i dont think that he did it intentionally.The only reason why he didnt tell you was probably because that he loved you too much to tell you something that will hurt you.<br>  <br>  It would be better if you guys talked to a counceller or something, and try not to have negative thoughts... it makes to worse... by lots.<br>  <br>  Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

2OytGIRKaa	Sounds like everyone who laughs at your last name is incredibly immature. There is absolutely nothing wrong or funny about your last name. It's a completely normal last name.  In fact, you got off easy...I know plenty of people with unfortunate sounding last names that would beg for yours.  I would just ignore everyone who laughs...apparently their lives are so boring that they have to supplement their bland existence with pointless teasing (at any insignificant thing they can find) in order to feel important,  fulfilled, and happy inside. When really they are just idiots....anyway, GO NUNN!!!!!!|`|6SstJ0sdaa	I'm not sure. Perhaps they are concentrating on all of the /n/ sounds between then end of your first name and last name. But, I've heard of a lot more funny and embarrassing names than yours. If people laugh, either just walk away or say, "Whatever!" It's pretty immature to make fun of people's names anyway.<br>  <br>  No matter what, your name is not weird, so if you can, just chalk the teasing up to stupidity.|`|ydpZYaLUaa	You really don't have that funny of a name.

Tell him he has a great (insert body part here), and it fits you better then anyone else ever has. Call him a stud/tiger, and make sure to let him know that what he is doing is working (moans or mmmmms).

e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	Could it be just a projection?  You like him and your mind creates all these thoughts that he could be liking you too. Yes he could be shy and he could just be forcing himself to respond.  And yes, of course it would drive you crazy trying to guess, assume, wonder.  You'll just have to be more direct and open.  be more assertive, talk to him more and more. Actualize more and fantasize less.|`|AA10363258	if he will barely talk to you then he isn't worth the time.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	oh for sure. theres no doubt in my mind that he's lingering there because he likes it. ESP if he's shy! that's how shy guys make themselves known. the signs are very very subtle with shy guys. almost to make u think you're going nuts. i used to be a pretty shy guy. i still am, but i'd say im much better than i used to be.|`|AzpQGibNaa	honestly...he might be gay....if i were in your shoes i would confront him if this continues..but really you cant find out the truth unless you ask him in a polite way.|`|fpp19Jb5aa	BEEN THERE:) I am going to have to say he likes you. I ahd an art class in high school and I sat across from this really cute guy, and the same thing would happen, I would say hi and I would get the sometimes hey, but whenever the lights went down and the overhead projector on he would put his foot next to mine, or leg touching mine, eventually he would even look at me when he did it. It was fun for a while, until I realized he was being so quiet because he had a girlfriend at another school! Yeah, he was an A** but in any event I think he likes you best thing is play hard to get, next tiem he des it move your leg away see if he looks at you or moves it back, body language says ALL:) good luck

QcUkrLWraa	It's good that you've tried to talk to him. And now you know how he feels. And he's basically being a d*ck. So since he is, act totally nonchalant. Pretend you don't care, and leave him alone. Don't get too clingy. Ignoring him will give you a bit of dignity. Just act like whatever and hang out with a couple of your girlfriends more often. If he gets pissy and asks why you're being that way, be like, "I can act however the f*ck I want to because you don't seem to have a problem with being an inconsiderate b*tch either" or something|`|JV0i77uiaa	No you are not acting like a little girl, on the contrary your are acting like a mature person.  You don't have to say yes when you mean no.  Your boyfriend has a lot of nerve to ask to baby sit.  He should take you out and celebrate with you.  I would suggest you to back off for a while to see what happen.  You did the right thing when say no, I would have done the same thing,  feel proud of what you did.  Show your boyfriend that you are not a door mat.  If he wants to leave let him go.  He does not have any consideration for you, neither their friends.  God bless you and I hope you think about.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	First of all hes not changed. that is what you have to face. hes liking the bar scene and i suspect he will be there alot. its sad but hes put you to the way side and yes it was dumb for you to drive there and yes its bad the infant nearly died i would stay clear of that for that reason you could get yourself into a mess and go to jail but being by stander. i would just chalk this up to learning and move on with out him and it would be best for you to split this isn't worth the time and effort hes not making one for you and you know what? i had a bf 27 me 18 and he did. he didn't go no where with out me and therefore no bars so you see the difference and the situations wake up.|`|UdbnMZ0Eaa	wow, he sounds like a jerk.<br>  dump his sorry ***.|`|4ca7cbc3cf438ff2c043a82b2b46730caa	He sounds more immature than you.

Bars are pretty cool. I say you suck it up until you turn 21 and babysit.. because then you can get drunk every night and party harder than him.

Do not I repeat DO NOT go babysit that's bull **** tell him if you wanna go over there for the weekend and have fun go do your thing but just remember I'll be 21 soon and will go out whenever I want to.

I understand your dilemma, when your dude goes out for the night - you cant always go because of your age, I think that he is acting a little insensitive.  After all he knows that if he`s going out with his family and friends - and they`re going to bars - then you won`t be able to come at all.  So to tell you "get over it and stop acting like a little girl" - sounds like he`s being an ***.  He`s a little older but not by much - I would think that he might be willing to mix it up a little - go to bars with them - and go out with them to a social event where you can go too.  Thats from your perspective from his - he`s 25 and always has access to alcohol when he goes out - it might be a little difficult to go out for the evening and not have alcohol redaily available in case he feels like having a drink.  I understand that too - I think you need to try and come to some sort of compromise because in a few  months you will be able to go to bars too - so he should be able to go out a few nights with you withouht going to bars or social situations where alcohol is present.  <br>  <br>  The babysitting thing - I wont even touch that - thats not cool - you`re invited if you want to babysit the children of some people you dont know.  Otherwise - you`re not invited....I dont know - that doesn`t sound like a loving relationship.  I would be hurt by that too - if my lady put me in that situation - maybe even a little cross....<br>  <br>  Tell this dude that his behaviour lately has been upseting you and explain why - he should be able to recognize that he was not treating you in a respectful manner.....good luk.|`|C5bhtFXpaa	I stopped reading halfway down. This guy isn't worth your time and i know it will hurt a lot to end your relationship; but this is only a glimpse of the months or years to come. Find a guy who wants to be with you instead of going out. Good guys are out there, maybe you just have to look harder.|`|dDzeqKCwaa	You guise have only been dating for 8 months and have a  kid. Thats ok. But he doesnt seem like he really wants a family. He seems more immature than you. You have every right to not do what he asked you to do, because thats not fair to you at all. I think you should take your baby ( i am sorry it almost died! that would horrible to see and deal with! I hope he/she is ok!! ) And leave him. Youd eserve better. You have your whole life ahead of you still and you arent the one who is going to lose someone he is. Dont just go streight into a break up. I think since you gusie have a child. Go see a therepist or something, and try to resolve this. If he really loved you he would do whats best for you and the baby. Bar-hopping is not it. And leaving you alone with the baby is not ok. He can wait 5 more months until your 21. Just sit him down one night, and say if you dont listen then i am going to leave. Is he abusive? if so thats a different story. You need to get away! Sometime when hes not home. I hope helped. BASICALLY: try to see a therapist and work things out if that doesnt work then you might want to just get up and leave. Take the baby. Fight for custody!  good luck. <br>  God bless you.|`|hvBprpcIaa	I can understand both you're points. Its rude that he is leaving you out and being mean about it, but i understand his point too. You cant just come afterwords to hang out when you turned down the babysitting gig. I would tell him you understand this but you really don't like him leaving you out. If he doesn't understand this, and things get worse, dump him. He doesn't deserve you then.
oOD3dYaNaa	It means that she likes you. Make the first move! Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. =]<br>  Then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet.|`|ActCDwzUaa	The best thing to do is enjoy her where her dad. Like at school, see I'd she can stay back with you or something.

I'd seriously advise you to make the first move on this guy of yours because if you don't your only other option is to somehow coincidentally run into him and fall which is a bit too dramatic. Just ask him to meet you face to face and tell him what you need to tell him........at worst he'll say no.......o nooooooo so badddd........don't worry if you present yourself well and your case there is no way he'll turn you away :)|`|au1yFfuxaa	You are very right - you can't tell him you have changed, you have to prove it.  Which will take time, so if he means as much as you say, be prepared to be very patient. I don't believe that you need to move on. You obviously are still head over heels for him. Honestly, I would call him. I know it's going to take so much strength and courage to do it, but you'll never know the outcome of calling him unless you pick up the phone and do it. Love is so tricky, and you have to fully put your heart out there for things to work out. Yes, it is likely you may get hurt, or he may get hurt, but I can't stress enough how much you will regret it if you don't just try. So please try!!|`|aQAxs0XWaa	Umm...just talk to him...tell him your feelings...<br>  and if he dosen't want to talk to you after that...well<br>  srry but then I guess its just not meant to be.|`|IgeMPzSKaa	If you aren't gonna call him, and your aren't gonna move on.. there isn't much advice someone can give.|`|Oj6vadz5aa	tell ur friend to ask him what is his problem? and also tell that u want become friend as like before u are.|`|j5o5qYmpaa	Well I hate to tel u this but need to mov on<br>  It sucks trust me i know|`|i9Rycd9Haa	watch a movie "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" .<br>  It will help you I guarantee it :)|`|M8f4BorPaa	actually SHOW him that uve changed and ur a different person, u cood text him something simple like "i miss you" "i need to talk to you" and get everything back to the way it was. im sorry i was stupid? n sorry if this is no tthe best anser its all i can thinkk of. now will u anser my question?!|`|KKhc5UiYaa	Well if you don't call him 1st he may not wait for you forever, and me and my g/f had that sorta problems nothing that i needed to fix for her but stupid arguments and we told each to f*** off and i really was done with her until she called me up, and i've called her up when we fight too but this time you may need to swallow your pride and just give him a buzz and be the bigger person and apologize to him and say that you still really want to be with him, because he probably still wants to be with you, but if you let too much time go by and dont hear anything from him you may lose him for good espically if it's been 2 months

I can't tell you if you're gay or not.  I have nothing against gay people, but I can't help you with this and no one really can despite any pretenses to the contrary.  However, I'll give you an analogy that may help you.  I'm a man who is not gay.  However, I can see another man and know that he is attractive.  This doesn't mean I want to bend him over and give him a reach around.  I can simply recognize human attractiveness even in my same sex.  My point?  Just because you see another girl and realize she's attractive, or even hot, does not necessarily mean you're gay.  You have to ask yourself what that means.  Do you think she's hot AND want to engage in sexual relations?  Be honest now.  The driving human motivation for dating at all is really sex.<br>  <br>  But, I'm not here to convince you one way or the other.

They will order a home study by a lisenced social worker and set parameters that he has to obey by law, such as having the girls home on time and possibly not smoking around them.<br>  <br>  I know it seems bad, but when you let them go do document how hard it is to parent with this guy.

In fact, take a few breaths before you talk to her. If she asks why you're not looking at her in the eyes, tell her the truth (that you're nervous). It's actually kind of cute when a guy is nervous because he has feelings for a his girl. After you get used to her, you'll have lots of time to learn to be comfortable near her. Usually, I like to hold onto my boyfriend's hand when he makes me feel all...knotty down my stomach.

That's kinda weird but, I hope you see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Oh and she definitely likes you back, or she wouldn't dream about you.|`|UY4P6UFxaa	Maybe she meant like you guys kissed,hold hands, or talked about very deep stuff, perhaps maybe sex. who knows ahaha but she didnt wanna tell you cause it was probably embarassing.<br>  <br>  And if she likes you back, im not sure cause a dream doesnt say anything, ALTHOUGH dreams are based often what you think about alo. So maybe she thinks about you alot ;]<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|9kwzNM2paa	she is in love with you!!! a dream where you two are in a boat together, with dolphins and the rest is  'too personal' her dream was obviously about you two being together. she like you, but she may not know it yet, but she has shown sighns of liking you: the dream, other people thinking she lies you alot, so she likes you. good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|a62a095fb36310ebfa7fc6342ec37ce9aa	Sounds like she likes you to me!|`|4JWfH42waa	she likes you!<br>  <br>  i like you hahaha|`|PU1PPa5zaa	she definitely like you!<br>  why else would she be dreaming about youu?|`|au1yFfuxaa	Dreams can mean many different things. But the fact she told you all about it could mean she is hinting about her feelings. If she didn't like you she probably wouldn't tell you about an intimate dream like that. On the other hand, the dream could just mean she is very comfortable with you as a friend. Maybe you should try to talk to her about your feelings, straight forward to her. Going indirectly in those situations usually doesn't help that much. When the time is right, tell her how you feel. Just don't spill it out on her, ease into it. Say something along the lines, "I just want to put it out there, I really think you are a great friend, and I love spending time with you. But I think my feelings have escalated into more then just friendship."|`|dDzeqKCwaa	WEll i know i have had a dream where my crush and i have done some stuff and when i said personal i ment that we were making out and started takng our clothes off and my mom walked in..so maybe thats what she menat :D in that case i think she likes you because why else woud she dream about you. I meean really. i drema about my crushes all the time!!!|`|K33IEi1aaa	yeah, she really does like you.<br>  girls don't tell guys their dreams if they were in them unless they trust you. haha.<br>  <br>  dolphins in dreams also symbolizes spiritual guidance, your intellect, mental attributes and emotional trust. represent your willingness and ability to explore and navigate through your emotions.|`|4Z0k82lhaa	hey thanks for answering my Q. and maybe she was making out with you or something that could be a sign that she wants to and i think that she want to go out with you just my opinion|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	im guessing then maybe she does like you... just doesn't want you to know.. depending on her age depends on how she is thinking.. maybe playing hard to get or what not lol... but i think that yes.. she likes you and f your friend is trustworthy as you say then yeah probably!! :)|`|twLsRVthaa	OmG I have a dream book that say what everything means! okay the boat is a good sign that the person is going to do good in business and humor, but if u were like at the edge of the boat u are in danger. That all I got!|`|KgoUKOzvaa	the dream could mean that you were on her mind; she went o02 bedd thinkin of you; and too personal; that can mean a multiple of thinqs also ; but it sounds like sex o02 meh   =]|`|rZoyra8Baa	No. It means she wants you and her to go do some dolphins.|`|wtggfEWtaa	she likes you..your dreams are based off what you think about all the time so yea|`|Pvay9nGIaa	you know, people don't want to answer your questions when you're rude about othere people's|`|89YG8K2raa	oh you guys did the nasty
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you are talking about online ordination, you can't. Not all states recognize it as legal. You would have to assemble your own church with followers and then have it registered as a legal business.|`|1pNt9892aa	I know that in my state, among many other requirements, you have to either be a resident of the state or get a special permit which is only temporary and can be costly. I am not sure it would be cost effective for you to do this. It also seems like it would be very time consuming for something that might not realistically be necessary.|`|w4ZPaxsbaa	Well, research the Theological seminaries, Bible colleges, and such. Contact the headquarters of the religious organization whom you feel would be a match for your own Christian beliefs: Baptist, Evangelical, Lutheran, Assemblies of God, etc.<br>  <br>  That would be most logical first step, for through their graduate placement resources and database of each States recognition requirements could very well save you a lot of time and enable you to make a very good career choice.

QzHNSoycaa	if you're mean in a flirty way the girl will have more incentive to talk to you... because she'll want to beat you at this game... being a mean flirt becomes a silly competition back and forth about who is wittiest. try it. it shows that you arent juuuuust a nice guy which can come off as a cover or just annoying. and make sure you  still arent coming off as clingy..! =] good luck.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	because you're coming off as creepy and awkward most likely. you think you're being nice (and maybe you are) but in order to get a warm reception from strangers you need to be more than nice. you need to not be awkward.|`|z8mbnCWMaa	i like it when guys are sweet and nice<br>  but some girls get scarred if you are too nice or you bother them alot.
1ExGMhh3aa	You may try finding a therapist who can help you with this.  I'm 32 and have had a similar experience.<br>  <br>  I think the only way to learn to date is to actually do it.  Based on having two relationships you probably already know how to date.  You may not be good at it, but you aren't a lost cause.
E84iCYH2aa	Thats all bogus!! No-one is so king hearted that hez gonna go out his way and flirt with you because he wants to fix you with his friend. Is his friend kinda handicapped that he needs the help of other guy to impress you?<br>  <br>  I think that rather the guy in question likes you. Cant say whether its love still. Just be a little patient for a few more days and see whether he tries to be more close to you. After that better you talk yourself out to him and express your feelings.<br>  <br>  I am sure if he has any feeling then he will let you know. Else hez just flirting with you taking the name of his friend.|`|14tr16uuaa	The Bad news is:<br>  If you the friend you like is loyal to the friend you don't like...you won't end up with either of them when you tell one of them you are interested in the other.<br>  <br>  The good news is:<br>  Maybe try telling the one you like you don't like his friend in a romantic way, but ask the one you do like to hang out later, just as friends, and if something comes from that kudos to you!|`|q3lYPvLhaa	You Will Always Wonder in The Back Of Your Mind Unless You Just Tell Him The Truth And Ask Him If he feels The Same way... Just Tell Him Your Not interested In his friend An that You are More interested in him... You May Be Scared Of Rejection Or A little Nervous but if u dont u will always think about it. I graduated a few years ago an i still wonder about how things could have been if i would've had the nerve to tell some guys i liked them...|`|qiHNnZh7aa	just say to that guy that you dont like his friend and you like him and then you can also tell his friend that youare not into him and that you would like too be his friend only <br>  truth is better than anything

z8mbnCWMaa	ok so everyone is talking crap right...<br>  i had this problem for many years now.<br>  what i came to relize is that i shouldnt give a **** of what other bitches think or of what they say, all that matters is what i think of my self.i shouldnt cahnge who i am for anybody,i love who i am.whocares if bitches talk..lett them ******* talk them it only makes your a better person if you ignore it like its really nothing in your life and its not effecting you,show you cant lett anything get you down  in the end the **** talkers are the ones that will be morrally pathetic inside and out ,there true colors will show and there fake will start to show,<br>  <br>  <br>  *if people talk crap, take it as a compliment (your on there mind) and move on.|`|yUAGUph6aa	dont worry about what *itches be saying, they are all fu*&ing crazy! not you. they are all on drugs and dont know what the f$!@ they are talking about. dont care about whatever they say. and soon you wont even notice it i bet.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	umm hello its called skipping?<br>  tell ur mom you want to embrace yourselff and she was right and that you want to get a tatoo to show ur self confidence my friend did that....<br>  and ways answer mine <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304195337AA1FC6Y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  im actually crying right now and the only thing i can do i answer questions|`|S3uLASLnaa	I know how you feel, my freshman year was like this. I guess i was a threat to girls? My "friends" told me i was too rich and was stuck up. Truth is im not stuck up and im not that rich! I just stuck it through and once i stopped hanging out with my friends and kept myself low profile the talking stopped. When i finally came out from my low profile it seemed like all that talking never happened, but i hang out with different people now, some girls still hate me, but tell me a time a girl is never hated!?!
AzpQGibNaa	some guys are just like that. but tell her to try this... while she is sucking you tell her to jack you off at the same time but go in circle rotation around your penis and mainly focus on sucking the tip and every now and again deep throat it. if that still doesnt work you might have to get creative and go to a adult store if your old enough.... good luck|`|3cf1f2fdbbf7cacd07b092f1c1feab6aaa	you know I have the same problem! I can't make my boyfriend ***!! I feel so bad not being able to, but he says it's ok and he still likes that I'm doing it. If u find a solution HELP ME! <br>  The one thing I've heard though is you cannot be distracted and that you should just be relaxed. <br>  It sounds like you really care about her. Make sure you tell her how special she is =) <br>  (kinda feel bad for her! i know it sux for me >_>)|`|esXp2ENEaa	maybe your not comfortable enough with her to let go! If your not fully relaxed its really hard to get off!|`|KW0hPZhxaa	Maybee your just not that into her. Or maybee you just have some sort of mental block/ complex.
Ectn7tkSaa	Probably a compliment about my personality because if it is about looks it really isn't a compliment because it is just about genetics.

dc4883361b4a9ea867331eed902ded8daa	I love your additional details. A lady at work said no one should get married until they've finished school, traveled and had a job. So good on you!<br>  <br>  My fiancé and I knew we wanted to get married at 20. His parents got married at 20, and they're doing great over 30 years later. We got engaged at 22 due to religious reasons, but if you are in a loving and mature relationship I don't think age had much to do with it. I've met people in their 30's and 40's who shouldn't be in relationships.|`|ykMTrM0taa	The average person gets engaged/married around 27. People who marry younger have a lower probability of succeeding. <br>  <br>  That aside... I completely understand where you are coming from. Make sure that he's it and make sure that if something were happen, you'd be able to support yourself on your own. Otherwise, I think a longer engagement is a great idea for younger couples. You can grow together and give things time to prove that you are both fully capable adults (to the nay-sayers)<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|QHBuH39jaa	Well, its like this.  Did you two go to college.  Do you two have careers or just jobs.  Your engagement will probably lead to a pregnancy and then marital difficulties.  If you two are serious, you should plan for your future first.  Doesn't mean you still can live together and doesn't mean you can't accept the ring but I certainly would get married until you two have figured out how you are going to have security first.|`|01HjNcgyaa	well..take time..no need to rush! but think about it..are u willing to spend the rest of ur life w/him. too young? dude my friend is 16 and she's engage and she's not getting married til she's ready. tell ur bf-he'll understand!|`|OmsYxRDDaa	a little to early.  wait till ur like 23 or sumthin....good luck|`|WM3h9Nnpaa	i think its fine my cousin got ingaged at 21 and married and 22 and i was his best man lol i was really happy for him and you will be happer the younger your married.more energy i guess.but i think u might be playing to safe why w8 2 three years to get married.if you feel good about the guy take a few months or up to 1 year to get use to what it would be like for you to get married.|`|mKBveDhHaa	ya.. but if u dearly love them with all of ur heart then get married|`|PYOn4jL2aa	if you're in love, than that's great! age doesn't matter. but if you feel like you're second guessing, maybe you should wait.|`|0deecc87af80b3537612588548b1dc9caa	no one can judge you and tell you that your too young or not. if they do they are stupid to try. even someone who lives around you for all your lifetime will never really know. it should only matter to you. if you think your ready then do it if you dont then wait. <br>  i got married at 18 and im 19 now and working on getting divorced. my husband was 21 and wed been together for 5 years and it didnt work out. i think the problem was he was too immature and i was growing mentally and he didnt get that. we were growning apart and he was still the same so it just failed.<br>  if your SURE you want to spend every last breath with him then by all means marry him just be sure. and do it for the right reasons and ONLY for you. no one else. in the end you are the only one to know if your ready. ppl will try and tell you that your too young but im VERY mature for my age so whos to say im not ready? why is it my fault i was married and getting divorced when my partner was to immature to see the REALITY of being married? he was seeing things through "rose colored glasses" they call it. thinking marriage would fix things and i saw it from a realistic point of view. i tried hard he didnt. i was not to young to get married i was not in the relationship long enough to see that i was moving away from him for whatever reason.<br>  i have my bf now and im more happy then ive been in my LIFE and i wouldnt trade it for the world. and awhile down the road i want to get married to him and have babies and live happily ever after no matter how hard it is to get there.<br>  i hope you are happy with whatever you do! good luck!|`|1KDNlPGdaa	hell yeah, go for it. its great that u have found some one you want to spend the rest of ur life with. u cant predict the future and u both seem very responsible, its not like ur rushing into it and remember if this was the 70's u would have been married with children at 18 (for all those oldies that will say these guys are too young lol)|`|LzV0ujstaa	Not at all!

But just keep in mind that 50% of marriages end in divorce. Marriage is more than dating/living together. It is a TRUE commitment to one another. It is merging of your things, credit, and lives. Everything you both do will effect each other. Are you really ready to commit to spending the rest of your life to this one guy? Sure you're young, and honey I've been there too. I was 20 and engaged. But I literally woke up one day and realized I had to get out before I made a huge mistake. You may think this guy is it and it's what you want, but you have a lot of growing up to do, even when you're 21 you still have a lot of growing up to do. You will hopefully soon see that there are plenty of other men out there. Just be cautious and please think about what you're getting yourself into. Best of luck :)|`|NaKW0E5Baa	Not at all!<br>  <br>  I was married at 22, engaged at 19. I don't think that's too young in any way, as long as you know you really, really, REALLY care about the person. <br>  <br>  The fact that you're asking on YA makes it seem like you're too young. If you need to ask, you're not ready to be married.<br>  <br>  What others think of you...

I got engaged at 18 to my 21 year old boyfriend. Now we're getting married later this year, I'm 20 and he'll be 25 at the time. Of course I truly believe age doesn't matter. It's the person not the number that's tacked on to them. If you're ready then this is the perfect age to become engaged. If you're not then the perfect age to get engaged will happen later. You sound like you're in a very healthy and mature relationship. And that you're a mature person. Don't worry about what other people think.

DON'T RUSH IT!|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I think you're fine if he proposes to you and you get engaged.  It sounds as though you are in a pretty stable relationship and on the same page with each other.  Especially if you have lived together for 9 months, he sounds pretty reliable to me and just because you get engaged doesn't mean you have to get married right away.  I think he's trying to let you know that he's serious about you and to want to make you feel secure.  Good luck to you.|`|whNKDLuTaa	normally i would say its too young but its seems like your relationship is close and you respect each other much... and with a long engagement i dont see what the problem is|`|lfcbi9cYaa	"My boyfriend has told me that he'd like to propose to me once I turn 20, because he doesn't like the idea of a teenage engagement."<br>  ><br>  ><br>  And by that logic, I'd have to say NO!  Plus, the divorce rate before 25 is almost 80%.  You still have a lot of living/growing/life experiences ahead of you.|`|4UUVrWXtaa	Wow!! I've never in my life seen so many answers to a question.. hahaha.. but since i'd like to be part of them i will tell you that no.. you are not too young to be engaged..<br>  It seems like you already know that you want to do it and you are a responsible adult.. so go for it!|`|EnBhiRp3aa	My grandparents got married when they were 18 and 20, and they've been together for over 55 years.

I was 18 when I was engaged and then married later that year.  I'm 24 now and my husband is 27.  There have been bumps in the road...who am I kidding there have been boulders in the road.  Thing is we have always found ways over, around or under them and come out stronger and better for it.  Every situation is different.  We got married so quickly because he was leaving for basic in the Army and we didn't want to be apart for years of training.  If you are already living together and working on a life then the next step, getting engaged, seems like the right one to me.  I truly wish you good luck.  Always stay honest and open with each other.  Small white lies will turn into huge lies over time.|`|omyTegPOaa	then if you are willing to wait for three years if you are engaged then I think that is fine.|`|yi5dFO7paa	why have a long engagement? why not just wait to get engaged when you are more ready to get married|`|0Ngi2keVaa	Definitally not too young, as long as you have a long engagment your good.|`|0Jxkioh2aa	No, I think it's great that you want to get engaged. I hope everything works out and you have a wonderful wedding. :)|`|S5GP2nlUaa	No hell im 18 and my fiance is 21 so go for it.|`|Poht8MR9aa	Yes it is to young, but most of us don't listen to others and have to learn the hard way especially since you are already living as a married couple it really is just a technicality.|`|iVapI5JPaa	yah, just wait a few years hun. It's going to be worth it. Love doesn't rush things...|`|SsAf9vTraa	No, not at all, you seem very mature for this big step. If YOU think that you're ready, then go for it :) Best of luck!|`|8fT10Lvbaa	its not too early at all.<br>  <br>  i got married when i was 19...|`|cTJa8FZYaa	why do you care what people think? do what you want if getting engaged is something that will make you happy then do it. screw what ppl think, esp the dbags on yahoo answers|`|gP84NAwHaa	I don't think so :)|`|8f38917f28354b150fc3180e3404c810aa	i mean if you really want this and will commit you should do it, but i would want to see the world and see whats out there live on my own experience life for myself, see whats out there|`|Ict5JA4eaa	well, i think its a LITTLE young, but i mean atleast you 2 have actually been together for a long time, right? i think it would be fine...
0a9Pdw1haa	Ha Ha HA LOL LOLLOL YES  i bet in 5 years you will regret it, there is young love and real love....dont be fooled!!|`|H4f2dXVLaa	look, some people say "You're too young to be in love and make decisions!" but you are really young.  so much can happen in those 6 or 7 years. cheating, moving, all that stuff. theres really only like a 5% chance your relationship could last. overall, i say yes.|`|flGXcxwGaa	well you two know if you love one another. If you two love one another and have been dating for the past 2 years then why not get engaged. I think it is good for you two to wait ofcourse until you are finshed with college. I mean you two are only 15 and in 6 years when you are 21 you may be the same or you two may be totally different then the way you are now. Just remember to stay true to each other and if in 6 years or so you two want each other then be happy you got to spend 8 years together before you were married and if you 2 choose not to be together hopefully it will end well.<br>  <br>  I met my gf when I was 16. we talked for about 7 months before we started dating. I am now 20 and so is she and we are now married. We actually got married on march 8th 2 years ago. we both are working towards our bs and I am on my way to become a 35N in the army. we are doing good and we are happy we are married.<br>  <br>  Others i know have been dating since then and they divorced or left each other and started dating others. It really depends on how you two feel now, how you feel inbetween, and how you feel when you are getting married. you will marry whoever ypu love.<br>  best luck|`|GCH45ITmaa	Don't listen to all these discouraging people who are telling you that you are too young. I am 17 and have been in a relationship for three years with a guy that is now 19. He is my best friend and I love him with all of my heart. He has asked me to marry him and we have plans set for when I'm out of university. If you truly love this guy, you'll know. After all you're never too young to fall in love.|`|5oxoLx5naa	Now, yeah. But after college, definitely.|`|rq4dV4FIaa	a little but i mean if you guys truly are in love then why not.. :)<br>  <br>  good luck with everything!
yuwjQjKqaa	I think she is 17 or 18.|`|eQENZXz1aa	old enough =)|`|A0cFEX3Caa	rely pretty.! is tht u. love <br>  da red hair;) haha btw im a girl<br>  nd nawt a lezbo
xHh3Xnf6aa	To be 100% honest (and this is in no way meant to hurt your feelings) I'd be really turned off.  Maybe this makes me shallow, but if you're that small, I'm not sure if I'd even enjoy it.  Just being honest.  That's just me, but every girl is different, so don't fret.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	Sorry, but I find it very difficult to believe you are only 3" when fully erect. However, if this is really the case, I would say you just need to learn killer techniques. Do her from behind or have her on top. These are both positions that will give you deeper penetration so you feel bigger than you really are. Also, take your time when getting her revved up and it will help you not feel so inadequate cuz then you could both go at the same time.|`|go4R8pN3aa	I'd prolly giggle and run after my ex who was 9 inches.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't want to be mean, but that's tiny. It's not the motion of the ocean for me, it's definitely the size of the boat.<br>  <br>  <br>  I really hope this is a joke.|`|AzpQGibNaa	honestly.....if your really care about someone and want to b with them its not about the sex and the size of your "little man" (as you said)...what matters in whats inside...but if its just a fling....there are other ways you can pleasure her...|`|vj06RsBpaa	well buddy you have a tongue and 10 fingers you can get  a little creative...|`|fMFHzByxaa	turn off the lights.|`|An2GISZYaa	just have long foreplay and dont stick to the one position .   if you do doggy style (to the girl) it makes the penis feel bigger
IPS3hWweaa	That is whack. She should be making more of an effort to attend your concerts. Try not to let it bother you tho, and just explain to her that you would really like to have her be there and that it will make you feel better if you knew she was in the audience.<br>  <br>  Some parents can be very unsupportive, just don't do that to your own kids if you have children some day.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yes, that's sad.  But St Patricks is on the 17th, isn't it?|`|FeEU1IDOaa	First, don't listen to Alex. <br>  <br>  Second, St. Patricks day is on the 17th. Not the 14th. <br>  <br>  Tell her that she got her dates wrong, and that you really wish she would come see you play. Tell her it's hurting your feelings and you want her to be proud of you...that she can go out with her friends on the actual holiday. And if she won't do it, invite some of your other family to come and see you play.|`|GrBpDtqHaa	tell her how you fell,becuz that is messed up tell her you miss her want  her more in your life. and if she says you don't need me your big enough to not have me around, tell her maybe you are but that's doesn't mean you don't want her in you life. and if you have when she wants you tell her you'd rather do sumthing ellse than that. make her feel what you feel?|`|S3uLASLnaa	Your mother seems like you aren't her first priority, this is definitely messed up.|`|IsZ8qFRNaa	yep thats messed up|`|bdeymNvHaa	Yes - that's messed up.  It's so sad to see parents that don't take time to spend with their kids the short period of time they have.  St Patrick's Day is the 17th, a Tuesday, but maybe she's "celebrating" it on the 14th?  <br>  <br>  How many siblings do you have?  Not that it matters if she is going out with her friends.  She sounds like my sister and I'd love to kick her *** around or adopt you.  ;-)  <br>  <br>  Our kids actually got tired of us going to all their games, concerts, performances - or so they said...  It's great you want your parents to be there.|`|K82CFOzqaa	maybe there is something wrong with her maybe shes sad or upset of something. and she just doesn't wanna show it.<br>  instead of being self centered ask her whats wrong? how she feels? be in her life dude.<br>  or maybe shes mad at you maybe she wanted to spend quality time with you and you passed it up to hang with you friends. what comes around goes around.<br>  be more participated in her life.|`|yUAGUph6aa	you will have more. derrrrr.<br>  are you an only child???<br>  i have four brothers and three sisters. thats seven siblings, its no big f*&$ing deal if your mom misses three concerts, let her live her fu@#ing life, shes had to take care of you since you were born, she squeezed you out of her Vaginal cave and wiped your disgusting diarriah off your *** so dont cry if your mommy misses three concerts.|`|L0Quyt1Gaa	Be glad your mother hasn't told you she no longer wants you. Things happen. I am sure you will have more. Try letting her know how much you wish to have here there.|`|AA10495187	I wouldn't care whether or not my parents came or any family members as long as I am doing the damn thing.|`|dRvz15nkaa	totally messed up!|`|BqrQFLH5aa	yes. im sorry honey, but yeah thats kinda messed up.|`|V5CRGK86aa	st. pattys day is march 17th.

454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	I'm 23, Not a virgin. But if a guy told me he was one it would kind of weird me out. Just that I'd be more experienced and to be honest I don't want to have to show anyone the ropes. I guess that's shallow but it's how I feel. I know a female asked this, but just putting in my two cents! :)|`|eQENZXz1aa	itsa plus if you willing to give it up|`|XQZEa7oOaa	Opposite. It is a total turn on.|`|jgko7zVBaa	I can't say that it's a turn on or a turn off because that is still relating the idea to sex, but I can tell you that I admire you for staying a virgin for as long as you have. I can tell you one thing... If you want to know what a true turn on is, wait until the night that you get married to have sex for the first time and that will be the best turn on that you have and ever will experience. Not many people have these qualities anymore and if someone can bring that quality into a marriage, you are setting yourself up for a great relationship if you can find someone that sees things the same way, and they're out there. Good Luck and get away from lames that only want sex. There's more to life !!!|`|gVY2rU3qaa	WOW! I'm sooooo happy that you have saved yourself all this time. Being a virgen is definitely an attractive attribute. Don't give your virginity to anyone until you get married. Believe me your husband will love you even more because being a virgen says a lot about your character. I was a virgen until I got married to my husband and I know that he will never cheat or leave me because he really appreciates the fact that I saved myself.
ZDnPe5eIaa	well the obvious is of course she wants you to hear what shes saying.<br>  Anything else would have to be gathered from WHAT she is saying.<br>  maybe trying to look cool or let you know she likes you or another guy likes her.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Everyone wants to be heard ;)|`|Xd1acIA0aa	Yes, DUH! stuff your pants with a sock and get thier attention|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Yes, they are definitely trying to get your attention.  It means that they are too shy to come out and talk to you, in hopes that you will make the first move.  Just be yourself, trust in yourself, and have fun.  But be careful|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	its either they want to get noticed by you or they just nervous walking pass by you.. they tune up so high so as trying as much as they can to possibly to cover up you are not existed..|`|gAC9Ish8aa	Next time go up to them nd kiss them so they can shut the hell up hahaha lol|`|8fT10Lvbaa	she seeks your attention dude.........|`|DpcHIFjKaa	I'm a girl and i talk louder in front of a guy i'm interested in. The only reason i do it is so i can get his attention. If i talk really loud about something, that can get his attention so he can come and talk to me. If a girl does that it probably means she likes you. Just go over there and talk to her/them.|`|7HBwudViaa	Well this sounds like she is definetley trying to get your attention! She likes you! She really likes you :) Go for it! I know that when I like a boy I always talk louder when walking by him in the halls! I also try to laugh at all his jokes, it makes him feel good! :)|`|EfOGnaeSaa	It could mean lots of things were complicated creatures. It could mean she wants you to hear so you will put some input into her conversation? Therefore, talking to her. Or maybe notice me that I' am walking by you, or perhaps its just nerves.|`|qiHNnZh7aa	well this has happened quite many a times than i think she is trying to get your attention and make you know that she is wanting yours attention too|`|4gyOqTqGaa	they feel intimidated <br>  <br>  so they think if they talk louder, they will be bigger|`|M961DkIjaa	Definitely trying to get your attention.|`|FnnyT1mlaa	All in your head buddy.|`|ISMColXfaa	We just want you to notice us... <3<br>  or maybe we have voice problems..|`|DWfBhQrNaa	yes if girls start being loud or talking loud when she sees you she wants you to notice her

Just be genuine and loving.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about a random sexcapade, it is more of a gamble.  Just sort of hit on the person.  Yay,<br>  <br>  If you are talking about a friend that you want something more of, again, I think it is best to be blunt about it, but do not start out being like "hey friend, I kind of want to do the nasty with you".  Obviously haha|`|AA10779494	Ask the person if he needs any help. Then if he answers Yes, you can help this person. If the answer is No, then you can ask his help in a polite manner. The same question can be asked to this person and wait for his response. <br>  <br>  The probable answer from this person may be " Don't U have anything else to ask other than SEX to me?"

zzaScg0haa	It sounds to me like he is not fully interested
ZTVr2V3xaa	ok, first of all how old are you? I think the legal age to be able to choose which parent you want to live with is 12. I'm sure both of your parents love you very much and mabie your mom got involved too quick and deff. with the wrong guy if he's treating you like that. My parents divorced when I was 12 and my mom was my everything but she starting dateing a guy that I couldnt stand so I moved with my dad for a few years. You haft to do whats best for you and th eways it sounds you should probably be with your dad. I think its sad that your mom allows this man to treat you this way. I am a mother of 3 children and they are more important than anything and if any man would talk to them the way he talks to you then he wouldnt be my man anymore, BOTTOM LINE! Your mom needs to get her priorities in line and realize what he is doing to your relationship with her, because as long as she stays with him in time if not already you will end up resenting her for allowing that to happen and never doing anything about it. My heart goes out to you, Good Luck, I hope everything works out for the best.|`|MnoRqx3eaa	Your dad.
tObHGRGDaa	well i dont think that he has any right to boycott her having a prom date. <br>  whatever happened between them he seems pretty bitter and unwilling to have her in a better off state then he is. I would resolve this by going with her...and setting your guy friend up with someone.<br>  however..i dont know your situe so great that might upset her if she still has feelings for him. you gotta just let things fall into place. if you see an oppritunity for him to be happy, help him out. and ditto for her. but if things dont work out, remember, its not your fault, you tried.good luck!!|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	he is hinting U to go with him??? are u blind or sumthing???<br>  <br>  if you wanna both not get hurt.. compromise....<br>  tell your guypal, you not intending to hurt both parties. if he really wants you to be in his limo, tell him you have to bring his ex too.. but do tell your gal pal that he and her are officially over.. get over with.. i noe its hurtful.. but then she has to face it..then in the prom tell your guy pal, that you can only focus on your galpal only at the prom.. as a back up partner..|`|AA11315360	You cant. If you like her then take her to prom and dont go in his limo. Just tell him that you decided not to go in his limo and leave it at that.<br>  BUT if you want to be his friend only then dont go with her.

Good Luck|`|FImMEdNIaa	Well, that's simple you are attracted to her, i mean you literaly have these biological fluids swimming in your body inducing this sort of feeling, its called the attraction stage.

Or she is totally weirded out by what you said and is just ignoring it all together and pretending like it never happened. Personally that is what I would do.<br>  If she isn't going to address this issue herself, then don't waste your time on her. sure you can be friends but if she isn't going to move this any further then don't push it. Hey also maybe if you start showing interest in other girls, she may start to get jealous and then she will see what she is missing! :) Hope I helped!

RvmYqQtRaa	Tell him you understand if he's not ready to jump into...... well you. But be very open about discussing anything he wants to know before you two decide to do it.

If you can't talk to him about it openly and honestly then neither of you are ready to have sex.<br>  <br>  If you're worried that he's only saying he's ready because he thinks you WANT him to be ready then you should ask him outright.  There's no point in you two having sex unless you are both sure it's what you want.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying you shouldn't be having sex (I dont know anything about you so I can't judge) but you should be comfortable enough with each other to talk about it.  If you can't do this then you aren't ready for sex.

o0U2K84oaa	Let me tell you. You have two choices in front of you. One is being her best friend who is always there for her no matter how much of a hard time she is going through. Two is creating a 50/50 chance of ending your friendship by saying how you feel about her, creating an awkward situation and never being the same again. I think you already know what you gotta do.|`|jFCA0Pwcaa	just always be there and prove to her that you care about her. give her lil things because chances are this relationship will end bad too. when she comes to you crying, cuddle her. keep reconnecting will her; its impossible for a guy and a girl to be best friends without having feelings for one another.|`|SSG0MZwUaa	Well, all you can do is hope for the best..

Once you are comfortable doing things together in whatever setting you are already in, you should know her a little better. Keep an eye out for events that you think she might enjoy going to, and ask her to join you at one. The key point here is to become a good friend to her. Respect her, be someone she can trust, and be attuned to her interests, then see what happens from there.|`|xr4ovGEzaa	Okay.. hunny bunny. you cannot make a girl like you.

P4WJD6Cpaa	Act like you already have one. I have heard many guys say women didn't notice them until they already had a girlfriend. So act like you do and you should get more attention. Hope it works.|`|Lq4306a5aa	Are you attractive to the girls? <br>  <br>  Hard to answer, right?  You should be able to answer that question.  It should either be, "I believe so" or "not really".  And then you should be able to say why or why not.  <br>  <br>  You see, it's not possible to access whether you are an attractive guy b/c you get confirmation from some chick who called you cute or made out with you.  Doesn't work that way.  You have to know that you are cool the way you are.  Guys that wait for girls to make them feel wanted wonder why girls don't seem to want them.<br>  <br>  When you know what is attractive about you, you can proudly display these characteristics and girls will pick up on them and dig you. But, if you don't know what it is about you that girls would like, then they won't know what there is to like about you either.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  I've known guys that have a bit of a British accent that you can barely pick up on b/c they've lived here in America for years.  When these guys are around chix they find attractive, they suddenly have a mildly strong accent, and they become the prince charles type or one of the Beetles.  This is just a tactic, but the point is, they know a characteristic about them that they can use to their advantage and girls eat it up. <br>  <br>  You can't be a douche bag and turn into Sherlock Holmes or anything, but just pick up on features that you deem to be attractive and know why those features are attractive.  Once you've done that, sell yourself proudly (not desperately).  Also, when a girl seems into you, don't crowd her by calling her all of the time, like you're scared she'll go away.  Give her a bit of time to miss you and want to see you before you are already there.  Carry yourself as though you are an attractive guy that doesn't have to grovel or pay for a girl's attention.  The idea is that you KNOW you are worth any chix while. This is called self-confidence.<br>  <br>  Then flirt with as many chix as possible.  Turn into a flirt.  Practice it until it becomes fun and easy.  The old adage among pick up artist goes: "The guy who gets the most rejections, gets the most numbers by the end of the night".  <br>  <br>  Not that you are trying to become a pick up artist, but it's absolutely true.  Increase your odds at this game by approaching more women.  Not with a certain goal of marriage in mind, but to have fun flirting as the confident, cool attractive guy YOU KNOW you are.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Don't be desperate. That's important.
YRJFo6K0aa	Try snail mail! It takes a bit longer, yes, but there's an intimacy and thoughtfulness in handwritten letters that the internet cannot hope to compete with. Letters are wonderful on their own, but if you have the time consider trying something a little different. Writing riddles for each other to solve, putting in news clippings of stories he might be interested in, sending a photograph, a story you wrote, or anything you think he would enjoy is a great way of keeping the connection between the two of you. You can think about him as you put it together and send it to him, and he will probably be thinking of you with a smile on his face as he opens the letter or package. <br>  <br>  I know that response wasn't really geared towards helping you get your mind off him, but my suggestion is that you channel your thoughts of him into something positive instead of dwelling on the distance. Doing things for each other can make you feel (and be) close even when you're far away. As for the rest of the time, get together with friends and family, read a good book, participate in activities you enjoy, and try new things. Keep growing and learning so you have new things to share with each other when you are together again.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both :-)|`|eQENZXz1aa	just get a new one|`|QDHDift5aa	you haven't talked to him in a day and your freaking out? <br>  <br>  how would you talk to him the other days?<br>  <br>  get over him.

Cs6W9V3Baa	Welcome to maturity.<br>  <br>  It's a fact of life that we all lose friends.  You are not exempt.  You could write about it in a forum like this.  you could go out and get drunk.  You could go into a depression.  You could maintain contact with your friend through the internet and IM.  It really matters not "what you do" because you are dealing with it right at this moment.  This is how you are dealing with it.  Understand that and you are half way home.  <br>  <br>  With that said, I would really like to ask you why you think you are losing a friend.  Your friend is not dying.  All she is doing is moving.  Aren't you possibly over-reacting just a bit.  It may be unfortunate that you will not be able to see her every day, but what is to keep you from staying in contact and maintaining a close friendship?  It really isn't that you are losing a friend, but rather, the shape of the friendship is changing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|AA10776535	You move forward...You can always keep in contact its easier nowadays.

XhexwM1faa	I'm not sure what's considered loose, but I know looser is better. Yes, you heard that right. I think if you can easily fit like a penis that is like 8 inches long and 6 inches girth then you are probably loose. But that's a wild guesstimate. You CANNOT get loose by having sex. Its a myth that having lots of sex makes you loose. you are either born tight ot loose. I understand your vagina gets loose with age, but again, you are either born naturally tight or naturally loose (although doing those kegal excercises will make you tighter no matter your age). Finally, a tight vagina is not important at all. Its a bad thing. why? here's why:<br>  <br>   If a woman's vagina is too tight, then:<br>  <br>  A. her man will orgasm way to quickly<br>  B. She may feel pain because off to much friction<br>  C. As a result of A and B, the sex won't be pleasurable for the man or the woman<br>  <br>  But on the other hand, if a woman has a bigger, looser vagina, then:<br>  <br>  A. her man won't orgasm as quickly, and he will last much longer<br>  B. She won't experience nearly as much pain, if any<br>  C. Because of A and B, the sex will be a greatly satisfying experience for both of them (all else being equal)<br>  <br>  A loose vagina is better then a tight one, contrary to popular belief. Having a tight one is mostly a bad thing<br>  3 months ago|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	There's exercises to tighten muscles.<br>  Never found any too loose, some just tighter to start<br>  Nope<br>  Too tight is a bigger pain<br>  <br>  A vagina is basically an inverted penis|`|WpCwTxN5aa	Whether a vagina is too loose or not depends on the thickness of the penis.  If somebody complains that you're too loose, the proper retort is that his penis is only as thick as a pencil.<br>  <br>  But what's most likely to make a vagina become loose isn't age, it isn't the number of penises that have passed through it, but the number of baby's the have passed through it.
QlvcSgn0aa	no. once the truck is given back they will auction it and whatever they get at the auction will be subtracted off of what was owed on the vehicle. say she owed $25,000 and they sold it for $15,000 at the auction. Your mother would still owe $10,000. It sucks. I had it done to me!
pGIOz14Faa	One thing to remember is that children from a 1st marriage are always that - 1st.  Then you factor in the ex-wife and all the associated headaches with that situation.  Then your children come along and jealousy rears its' ugly head because 1st children realize that your children are the product of both of YOU.  You can make this work, but it takes huge amounts of love, patience, kindness and sometimes just good old fashioned shut the h*** up control.  Think!|`|AA11788494	Don't marry him.|`|LQISGYbEaa	Of course you will always have to sacrifice.

What you really should be worrying about is a college fund for the child he already has. When that is fully funded and you two have substantial savings, THEN start thinking about babies.<br>  Any children you might have will have to suffer if anything happens to your family income, because his first obligation is his little girl.

Not to make it sound like your making a bad choice, but id REALLY think about this. you will be giving up much more then you think.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i believe that, he feels that he doesn't want anymore children, only because he's probably sick and tired of fathering more than one woman. so he probably feels like he'll children all over the place. in my opinion is alot better to start fresh with someone who doesn't have kids like you do, so you BOTH can start together and experience the joy of having your FIRST child together. one shouldn't agree to have kids only if it makes the other happy. both should want children and it sounds like he doesn't want anymore. and with an attitude like that, i doubt he'll stick around. plus you'll have his ex coming in and out of your life for visits, money, you name it, so can you deal with that for the rest of your life? there's alot to remember. marrying a guy who already has a child is not that easy.

Just let her have her space, like if she gets up for something say ur all just sitting around, no need to follow her like that lost puppy (cuz trust me I highly doubt a group of ninjas is coming for her) so she will be fine.. just try to do those few simple things and I think you would improve..

When is the next time you will be offered a 3some with ppl you really want a 3some with.

ok83OgNKaa	Is this a joke?  This reminds me of the 7th grade... yea I would say he likes you and wants to act cocky but doesn't have the real confidence to tell you how he feels.  This type of chit chat  and flirting will probably continue until you both finally get close enough and flrt long enough that you dont have to ask each other out because you just realize you are already dating and then "make it official."  It's really a pretty childish way of doing things.  These are all signs he likes you but even larger signs that he is trying to cover his obvious lack of confidence with a paper thin sheild or arrogance and vanity.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	of course he likes you lol|`|bNrTP2w4aa	hes a player or heLIKES YOU!|`|NVdf3uAEaa	Well; does he say this to other girls?<br>  If so, he's just a flirt<br>  <br>  But if not, he may really like you.<br>  & he's probably trying to hint you that out to you without making things awkward if you don't like him back|`|HW7k38kAaa	hes totally flirting ;D<br>  <br>  answer mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqsKLKCrsjp4wuY4JRR7DHvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304191831AAaj3Tu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|atrObg5saa	yes! yes! yes!|`|rE5fTHuPaa	yes. he is definitely showing characteristics of feeling for you. but i think you need to hang out with him and make sure you like him|`|ef2904f23b858c736b0170be778e96d2aa	YES HE DOES|`|l93obmvuaa	yeah i think he does like you but i would talk to him more at school. don't be so shy. good luck =)

If the car is in your name and you can prove that he vandalised it, you can report him, but he might very well be out in a few hours. <br>  <br>  The absolute best thing you can do is get out and go live with a relative or friend as far away from him as possible.  See if they'll come get you when he's not home and just leave and never go back.<br>  <br>  If no friends and relatives, there are womens' groups and shelters in every state designed to help women in abusive situations. They should be able to help you get out and help you get your life together on your own far from him.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Call a friend, and get them to take you somewhere safe. <br>  <br>  He is not controlling, he is emotionally abusive.

TPRQDf5waa	it might not necessarily be her being insecure. she could just be really jealous and scared of losing you to other girls. just reassure her that you don't have feelings for any other girls but her. be understanding and eventually she'll come around. but be careful on giving up on your friendships with other girls because of what she says.

KSK22vHUaa	You can't really prove that. <br>  <br>  A hymen is a good indication of virginity, but at the same time, women can lose their hymens through sports or horseback riding or anything.  Some girls are born without a hymen at all.<br>  <br>  You're really just going to have to trust her.

I come from a muslim background and  I know how important it is for certain men that a woman is a virgin.<br>  <br>  My husband told me that if he found out that i wasn't a virgin after marriage that he would have divorced me...i was shocked because I never thought he was like that.  We dated for years before we got married.  I thought he was very americanized but i guess i was wrong.<br>  <br>  See my point, you have doubts already ...u will do urself and her a big dis-service by getting married with these thoguhts.<br>  I will be honest with you...it bothers u more that she was with another man! thats the key thing here. u say u heard this and already u don't trust her word...this is not a good ground for marriage.|`|fMiLQnSJaa	You must be living in India because in the U.S it doesn't matter how many people a person had sex with prior to getting married.|`|dVlLahozaa	if she had sex before haven't you why can't you get passed that and just love her for the person she is.

Most girls kind of wish their crush would overhear them talking about him. So the girl your talking about might have picked a spot to tell her friends where you might walk by. If thats the case, she definitly likes you. And chances are she told her friends she likes you. If they were talking about you, and you and this girl are friends, she probably wasn't making fun of you. and a giggle is always a good sign :)

mOvUrMkRaa	Does anybody ever know exactly when they will meet their true love? Everyone is the the same boat, we don't know what our future will bring. Some people will meet their 'life partner' as young adults, but I've known other people who've had to wait until their forties to meet and fall in love with their spouse. You are not sure if you have already found her. In my experience of love I really knew somebody was for me when was just so excited about them and had no doubt in my mind that I wanted to be with them. Even if their were obstacles in the way I would want to overcome those obstacles to be with them. So when you fall in love you'll just know it in your bones that your in love. Personally though, I believe in falling in love but I don't believe that their is only one soul mate out their for me. One should make the best of the relationship that they're in because they're committed to them, and if a person keeps breaking up with their partner because they think their 'soul mate' is still out there they'll only leave a trail of broken relationships in the pursuit of something they may never find.|`|hQA8Ql21aa	When you find her you will know.|`|29zyJ95Eaa	^ WORDS OF WISDOM

wck4MHREaa	Um...give her plenty of space and time, and make sure you don't screw s*** up with her, because you'll only do more harm. <br>  <br>  Here's the thing, ever since my first crush completely massacred my heart, I've been extremely distrusting of women, all women. My friends know this- I have these weird tendencies, such as to ask a girl multiple times "are you sure" if I ask her to go out with me, even if she says "Yes", and I often fret that my girl friends are betraying me or talking bad about me behind my back, even though they're not. I'm working on that more, and I'm opening up to girls more, but I'm not 100% yet. I need some more time and a person that's open to me and knows what I'm going through.<br>  <br>  That's what you need to be for this girl- a rock, a solid person for her to rely on. You can't crowd her with your problems and you definitely need to let her figure out things on her own.

7ypRtqAGaa	Okay well first, you already have a problem. you can't suddenly want to be in a relationship when you are insecure & don't have confidence in you. that is only going to cause problems in the relationship, and you will end up getting hurt ! the first thing you need to do before anything, is find yourself, love yourself, and respect yourself. You can't Make someone like you, that is something that has to happen naturally ! but you can get to know him and try to say hi to him when you see him, and try to start small conversations about anything. maybe ask about the homework, ask him where he got his shoes because you like them, smile at him when he happens to look at you, and above all, be yourself =) good luck, i hope i helped !|`|THDeeEBNaa	first u  make friend and u chose best friend

38193506d53dade90585f207e6844e75aa	It really depends on the person.<br>  <br>  I'm 15 and I'm more concerned with my studies because I'm really overachieving and I really enjoy school work (I'm weird, I know). I also strive to do my best, but that's mostly because of my parents. So I'm more stressed out with my studies and parents. I'm not interested in bf/gf relationships right now so I don't stress out about that at all.<br>  <br>  Though I do know a lot of people who are more stressed out about bf/gf stuff than they are about studies. I know people who don't care about their studies at all. They just don't do their homework and they don't study for the tests and they don't really do anything school related. They're probably more stressed out about bf/gf stuff and parents. These are, actually, the people who try really hard to impress people of the opposite gender so they probably stress out about bf/gf stuff.<br>  <br>  I don't think I know anyone who stresses out about parents asides from myself. Usually parental stresses are very much related to studical stresses.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	It depends on the individual.  I think that 12-14 at least are concerned with parents and relationships more than studies because schools don't quite expect the same time requirement.  Depending on the relationships or lack of, 14-17 become increasingly concerned as bodies develop and hormones go on overdrive.  Studies become more important due to college and parents less so.<br>  <br>  but then again, its all on an individual basis.|`|ptWHIVjZaa	It depends on the individual in question.  I, for one, go through phases between being relationship (or rather, lack thereof) obsessed and being stressed out with studies.  Well, I'm always stressed out with studies, but sometimes I back off for a minute or two and start looking at the social aspect of school.<br>  <br>  I do, however, know some kids who don't give a rip about schoolwork, don't stress it at all, but spend all day everyday venting to their friends about their worries about relationships.

Now put the guy out of your mind and move forward.|`|ZUqeOX2iaa	u have to let go ur first guy becoz if u continue to be with him, after the initial 3 or 4 months u might not be happy with him (as u already feel he is a jerk). but  if u choose to be with the second guy he'd make u happy. so start going out with him...u'll slowly forget the first one...<br>  above all it's ur happiness that matters.|`|Q5HJfJFZaa	You could either continue to waste your heart on a jerk or find happiness with the good guy who's with you. It's a no-brainer.|`|s2g9CgvAaa	umm....the first guy is a JERK and RACIST?<br>  I say go with guy number 2!!|`|FtUy9etoaa	If someone isn't interested in me, that would be a big turn off for me. Get closer with the nicer guy and see how your 5-year crush reacts. If he doesn't at all and you think it is because he can't show his feelings, you are being naive. If he does, confront him bluntly to resolve your dilemma.<br>  <br>  If you don't solve it, he may lurk in your mind for as long as you see him.|`|7nA2EiHVaa	I think that you should go for the second guy.<br>  this is simply because if you find an imperfection in the first guy, then maybe he just isn't the one.. and that's not fair to either of you, now is it? <br>  and besides.. i think you are hung up on the first guy because you are just so used to liking him. <br>  I think if you go for the second guy, you will know he's the one when he makes you forget about the first guy :)<br>  <br>  sound logical?|`|M9iOiYZtaa	whatever it is girl,you have to choose..<br>  ask yourself what you really want and choose.if you dont choose,you'll drag this and it will become complicated later on..<br>  <br>  go for the one that you feel most comfortable with..<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|9nOQlbwEaa	you have to make a decision whether to drop the first one or second one. You can't have them both in the same time , in the end you will end up with no body.|`|AA11136495	just because you have liked someone for awhile doesnt mean you have an obligation to like them, and if they are a bad person anyway your only setting yourself up to get hurt, dont hesitate in giving him up if you find someone else.|`|AA11908256	do em both, at the same time then choose.........just kidding<br>  perhaps he has a good reason for his being racist. in reality, you will<br>  have to choose or lose both|`|S97zMQbVaa	get a life|`|6uoDNqReaa	Stick to what your heart says|`|gqH6UkMdaa	i think you should go for the second guy.... you obviously know he's better than the first.... it takes time but you will get over the first guy.... sometimes it takes another guy to take the first one off your mind<br>  hope that helps good luck :)|`|dR4b3beNaa	definently go with the second dude.
otTMXJvRaa	Hi Vampire Lover,<br>  <br>  French kissing?  It’s tongue use, and it'll come naturally to you.<br>  <br>  Different people enjoy different things... kissing wet versus dry, breathing or holding your breath, etc. Using mouthwash or brushing your teeth first is a good idea.<br>  <br>  However, the mechanics of making out is not the only thing that needs to be addressed. Please be advised that making out will get both you and the guy pretty excited. How well do you know the guy? How far will you let him go? How far do you want to go? Can you trust him to stop if you say no? Do your parents know you are dating?<br>  <br>  Let’s assume that you’re 16 and in High School, old enough to date, that you’re a decent young lady, and it’s OK with your parents. <br>  <br>  Perhaps a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, and sex would be helpful for you to think about right now.<br>  <br>  Vampire Lover... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early. If you’re under 16, then that’s too young to be making out. If you’re under 18, then sex is against the law for the guy.<br>  <br>  First off... in High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits. <br>  <br>  Be advised that girls and guys often have different views regarding physical affection. The kissing will very likely make you feel closer to the guy. There’s no guarantee it’ll make him feel closer to you, though. You could end up with a serious crush on him, while he might be willing to just walk away.<br>  <br>  Don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.<br>  <br>  Vampire Lover... crushes/love/kissing/sex are wonderful intimate expressions that can all be compared to fire.<br>  <br>  Both intimacy and fire can be dangerous if used improperly.<br>  <br>  When used improperly, you know that fire can cause serious damage. Intimacy, when used improperly, can also cause serious damage... such as heartache, pregnancy, and STD's.<br>  <br>  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).<br>  <br>  Vampire Lover, here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:<br>  <br>  1. There are some guys out there (young and old) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No".<br>  <br>  2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.<br>  <br>  You should also never attend a party or any event with drugs or heavy alcohol abuse.<br>  <br>  Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. That means no premarital sex. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong guy... but kissing is much less dangerous).<br>  <br>  OK, why no premarital sex? <br>  <br>  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).<br>  <br>  Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.<br>  <br>  Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.<br>  <br>  Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators. <br>  <br>  By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guy you are dating just wants to get into your pants… or if he truly respects you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family. <br>  <br>  Vampire Lover, just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.<br>  <br>  You need to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Trustworthy guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate.<br>  <br>  Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you give away your body without the commitment of marriage.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice.<br>  <br>  You will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much the big picture that you should be looking at, Vampire Lover.<br>  <br>  Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife... provided you stay out of trouble and make good decisions.<br>  <br>  Take care, and God bless.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  - Charlie<br>  <br>  P.S. - If you are looking to have a good High School experience... including the BF part... then it would be a good idea for you to join sports teams at school. There will be less free time for you to dwell on BF and dating issues. Plus, you'll be in good shape, and you'll look cute in the competitive outfits at the games. Guys are absolutely fascinated by female athletes, and love seeing them in shorts and t-shirts... with minimal make-up... and they won't care if you are sweaty and your hair is a bit messed up. No kidding. You'll have more boys looking at you than you ever thought was possible. And your wardrobe costs??? Essentially zero! In addition, your Coach will be around to keep an eye on you and give good advice if you need it. <br>  <br>  Finally, you'll develop more self esteem, confidence, self control, better judgment, and you'll be much less likely to get into trouble. You'll be stronger mentally, and any BF relationships that develop will be more stable. Guaranteed 100%.|`|hUynmdRSaa	I was like that before my first real kiss. First you just need to calm down. If your freaking out your most likely going to do something weird so just take a deep breath. FIrst make sure you don't have bad breath. It sucks. Don't chew gum though. You can make out with it in your mouth and stuff but you don't want to on your first kiss. You should start off with just a small kiss with your mouth slightly open. Then he'll probably start moving his tongue in. Don't freak out. It's going to feel weird at first but you'll love it. Just open your mouth a little wider but not too wide that your all over him you know? There really isn't any right way to kiss. It's all about you and your partner. Just let him take the lead and kind of do what he does. Remember to breathe through your nose. Don't hold your breathe. It's really not something you can plan. Just remember to relax. You'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|sL5CY6Q7aa	well first off... dont be nervous. just calm down and relax while doing it. :) go with the flow. just open your mouth and connect with his. you dont have to use your tongue unless he makes that first move. if he does then you can either let him do it, or just use yours to feel around too. haha first time is not perfect of course, but you will get better. practice really helps... trust me. and you wont be bad haha. i have never met a girl thats bad at it. he will not think you are bad so dont worry about that. guys dont care haha|`|ACksTjZIaa	................wow. calm down. no offense, but you sound like your 10 yrs old. just go with the flow. do what he does. if he is as young as you are he probably won't know how to french kiss either
cE8SQUEbaa	too many people... i just hate it when sooo much people are buzzing in and out of my house...|`|E7TkNO00aa	Wrinkles. I'm 33 years old.
AxAX0aqraa	honestly..he asked u out on text?<br>  and hes in hawaii on vacation?<br>  seems like hes bored on vacation...<br>  i'v dealt with a guy like that and..guess what he was just playing me..<br>  but its up to u..im just telling u from my exp.|`|yxPv1mzfaa	oookayy lets seeee.....<br>  well if u already went out with him before then that makes interesting. i think that i he was making fun of u and it was definitely not in a playful way then you shouldn't go back with him. if u just might like him a little bit then i say that if its possible to keep him as a friend to try n figure things out for yourself. overall i don't think that u should go out with him...he may have said nice things to u but if u think he wants a gf just to have one then u better off without him.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps you :)
bMMmTKRWaa	I'm a sucker for a sexy surfer.  Short brown hair, tall, surfboard in hand.  Abs of steel...Plaid shorts, neoprene wetsuit...ahh.  makes me swoon.  :)|`|1thElV58aa	your not a lesbian I went through that phase in middle school I was not interested in guys not ever girl has to be boy crazy. Soon this will catch up to you.|`|qiHNnZh7aa	well i always have my dream boy and i imagine him to be very manly and a very good physics warrior type and he would come to me riding a horse and then would kiss me and take me away a bit fairy story type <br>  i don't think you are a lesbo so don't worry and move on you will find your dream man|`|xCP1mybiaa	Tall, muscles exploding out of his shirt sleeves and a little veiny too (like the hulk), blue eyes, messed up hair, kind, gentle, rough hands to massage my smooth back.<br>  <br>  Hehe, thats actually just the description of my boyfriend. :p|`|DCfHWPAdaa	repeat that back to yourself??  I really dont know what to say to you..
QEVd5lR2aa	Go eat a burrito.<br>  You weigh less than me.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	you didn't say anything about your personality..<br>  <br>  but at first glance i guess i'd just think you were one of those stereotypical scene guys who listen to hardcore music only because they think it makes them cool.<br>  <br>  that's complete honesty.<br>  <br>  however i'm sure that under you're clothes you're different, which is why i was wondering about your personality.|`|fkchpcHJaa	u sound like a mop wearing nike sbs|`|3z6lwCHuaa	emo-ish and hott.|`|NnhP2phpaa	work out a little<br>  get some muscles
wck4MHREaa	I don't agree with Brenden, you can totally make the first move if you like. Actually, I have way more respect for a girl who takes action in these types of situations. In the heat of the moment, all bets are off. Just get up close to him, lean in, and go for the kill...er, kiss.<br>  <br>  As the great Paul Rudd once said, "Step up to get your rep up, bro".|`|GVVoTtp8aa	Gosh i remember those days, There is no right answer girly, your just gonna have to wait and see. When me and my first boyfriend kissed we bumped teeth. We did it at the same time lol, i remember the ackwardness. Just have fun and be patient. These are the fun innocent times, live it up, it doesnt last forever!|`|6jrv0MWTaa	Round the corner from the entance doorway.|`|8SRjELNBaa	no.<br>  <br>  It's the man's job to find the balls to make the first move.<br>  <br>  However, feel free to say "kiss me".|`|YE0baNYRaa	yes. make the first move. since he is shy you take over. some guys are really turned on by ladies leading in bed. i think a kiss on his forhead , on neck and finally on his lips would be a great idea.
Np11gNZfaa	well, if u haven't given her a reason to keep an eye on you then she is being too protective. I kno this is hard for you and i think the right thing to do would be to bring up this topic. Ask her y she doesnt trust you or why she would dump u. if her answer comes as incomplete or lame then u have a reason to dump her. Long relationships have a bad reputation and hardly ever work out. My advice would be to make sure the she wasnt kidding and if she wasnt, i would start new over in London. I hope i was able to help.... good luck babe!<br>  <br>  <br>  kzz|`|0256031db1c41cfa58580ce6202c3468aa	Go!  Your young and trust me if she isn't cool with it there are other fish in the sea!|`|5ec4a7320544849db548c277a8e431f2aa	Maybe your girlfriend as been hurt in the past and this is why she doesn't trust you. <br>  You cant have a relationship without trust.<br>  Good luck.
nXombf2baa	Your cousin is out of line. You brought photos of you and grandma because these are the photos you had. He should have had photos of him with grandma, if he had any. I see no reason for you not to go to the cemetery. This is a family event, and a very important one. If you can, stay away from him at the service. If there are other family members, ask them before hand to help you keep the tension down at the service. It is very disrespectful for your cousin to make a scene. He shows disrespect towards your grandma, you, your aunt, and other people who will be at the service. Maturity doesn't seem to be present in your cousin. My condolences to you, and your family.|`|yCBsi5OYaa	your cousin is stupid<br>  <br>  it sounds like you really loved your grandmother and a stupid cousin should never stop you.<br>  <br>  attend the funeral and keep your cool.<br>  <br>  he almost sounds jealous. maybe he wishes that he had such a close relationship w/ her as u did.... <br>  <br>  ** maybe it is something to do w/ will?<br>  ...<br>  well to me it sounds like he is jealous or something ask him yourself.<br>  <br>  but i think that you definitely should go!|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	Try to avoid the drama as much as you can. Funerals in my family have had a lot of drama as well. If it's possible ride in a different vehicle. A little extra gas is a small price to pay.While I think his Poor behavior shows disrespect for the deceased, it is good to remember that they are hurting too. If it comes down to a confrontation. Back away. I have personally had experiences of this type of confrontation, I have known of some of these conflicts to have far reaching consequences. I have even heard of some that have become lethal when the family members failed to control their siblings. My grandfather has been dead for 20+ years now. The consequences from the actions of some of my family members have split our family to this day. If it is possible, ask someone who is respected by your cousin to have a talk with him. maybe at least this can get you through the hard times at the funeral itself if nothing else. try to stay out of each others way as much as possible even afterward. These emotions can last for days or even weeks after the burial is concluded.
1dLPOgyRaa	well.. theres this guy that likes me.<br>  he flirts. alot.and he tells me im cute,pretty and beautiful.<br>  he always tells me nice things. and he told me he likes me.<br>  so thats all i know.
1f8ba46cfe12fef9d7b5b2384ce3943caa	get better grades and with your looks and whatever you have - you'll be a force to rekon with. Guys will look at you
QEVd5lR2aa	Ahahaha, ALADDIN! That's amazing.<br>  There's nothing wrong with fictional crushes. I have a crush on Jacob Black too! Fictional guys are obviously better than real ones, they are made up and pretty much perfect. Why wouldn't you have a crush on them?|`|it5cjyOraa	ha im 15 and i have the same deal. i like aladdin too! lol and i also used to like vikter krum from harry potter! i dont think its anything to worry bout cuz if their cute or you like their personality or whatever then who cares if their not real? dont sweat it :)|`|inp056fVaa	omigosh! I'm just like you!! how weird!|`|50c8e1297c797d962150674ea98734adaa	wow.. .... wow..... uh...? must be a girl thing.. either that or you are in a crowd regarded as "special"
AvmKTcJNaa	Come on people! Leave her alone! She already said it was not a predator because she actually SEEN him. There a very few ways he could have tricked her: he has an illness where he stays young, became a vampire, has the mind of an evil genius to bend light to appear her age, or found the fountain of youth... yeah, I think it's unlikely too. I'm pretty sure she can tell the difference between a 40 something to a 13 year old. But apparently people can't read. Sorry, not in a good mood today.<br>  <br>  Anyway, long distance relationships are hard- Even for full gown adults. And relationships at a young age is difficult on it's own. Now to merge the two together... well anyone could have seen it coming. You don't want most of your dating life to be online. You'll be missing out on so much. If you two are truly meant to be together he'll find you again. Just don't wait for him. Live your life as it should be.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.|`|XADP739faa	There always is a chance. Nothing is impossible. Not even flying- aeroplanes!<br>  Maybe there is some way of contacting him? Of course he would be upset.|`|cc64f7e4c9e3134ab80c47121bcd1125aa	prob got busted by chris hansen of dateline|`|rsE1m7aOaa	oh my god hahah this is just like "to catch a predator"|`|VvxirjC4aa	dont get involved in online relationships nuff said ur 15 dont worry about it you will you have plenty of time|`|JajEhcsUaa	Online romance never works out.

Computers are not a substitute for a real person; you're missing out on a person's attributes, physicality, their actions, words, voice, etc. Webcam conversations are close to it, but it's still not the same, so I wouldn't consider this anything unless you meet up IN REAL LIFE.|`|jRz7dYaRaa	try to stick with people you meet in person. even if he wanted to go out with you, what is he going to tell his friends/parents, i met this girl online who is 3 hours away and now we are getting married. try to avoid the whole online dating thing, it's caused this one girl a serious problem, and i of course was the one she had to call everyday to talk about how depressed she was|`|K2EtMBjOaa	How did he end this relationship? Because what I thought of when I read this is that maybe he was just as heartbroken as you from the breakup and that's wy he hasn't been online. You may wonder why he would have broken up with you then? Well possibly because maybe like his parent found out and didn't want him doing this, or something like that, and he was forced to. <br>  <br>  Just an opinion, but I hope I helped.

If he truly liked you and not his gf when he cheated on her than he wouldn't feel bad. He's asking if you are going after guys to make sure you're still there so that whenever he's feeling lonely he can txt or call you for entertainment. Really? please realize that he's using you and you're falling for it. <br>  <br>  *and i know this is not along the lines of your question - but IT IS NOT OKAY TO CHEAT WITH SOMEONE! NEVER THINK THAT IS OK NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU LIKE EACH OTHER!!!!!!!!|`|9ny32KGGaa	He likes you.<br>  I've found out that guys don't really give a **** who you like unless they have a crush on you.<br>  Tell him! :)|`|bK0ETaU0aa	I think he hasn't collected his thoughts correctly because he's still torn between you and his girlfriend and that's probably what you should tell him.|`|MdOOdqnpaa	Well to me this sounds familiar. Course we have all been through this , and have spoken to many friends with the same problem. Sounds to be that you guys were very close friends before anything else, and that always makes it seem harder. Because once you have gone into that friend stage, and then realize you like eachother, it makes it complicated because you want to be with them, but at the same time, don't want to ruin thre friendship. I think it would have been better if you guys spoke about the friendship before getting intimate, but we are only human. Best thing you can do is learn from the mistake. Another thing, it sounds like this guy doesn't really know what he wants. I suggest you talk to him. Tell him how this is making you feel. Sometimes guys are cut out to be more of a friend then a lover. In this case, it sounds like this one should just be a friend. Because nobody likes to be in a roller coaster of emotions all the time. Course you can be friends and lovers, but this guy sounds like he is confused. so talk to him. Tell him how this is all making you feel. Get some input on how all this has made him feel. I hope this helps some.
shOe71Veaa	respect buddy. that really sounds like love to me. i too am 17 and i can understand what you are going through...<br>  <br>  alright lets get to the point iam gonna try my best here.<br>  <br>  the way you described her sounds as she is the perfect girl for, pretty much everyone. you should take into the account that you are probably not the only one who noticed her being so beautiful and so on. however, you have a special bond with her that probably not even her boyfriend has. you said you know her for 3 years.  thats a looong time, and both of you by now should know each other quite well, so thats a plus. <br>  <br>  furthermore, it seems the girl is actually into you aswell. though girls can sometime be hard to decipher or interpret, her actions speak louder than words. hugging you, kissing you, and talking to her parents about you is a waay big plus. <br>  <br>  so far so good, you are into her and she seems to be into you aswell, now lets get to your problem with the shyness/scared/freezing when asking her out.<br>  <br>  perhaps this is where i see the entire problem, theres always that "if i had.." in this sort of situations. if you had given her that ring, or just stole a kiss from her, or maybe even letting her know that you have those feelings towards her, another story could've been unfold. dont ever expect a girl to make a move, we are the guys so we are by moral law expected to do the toughest actions we do (asking out, making the "move", etc.) if your lucky she would let u know that she likes you but in the end your the one that has to ask her to be your girlfrirend.<br>  <br>  great now lets move on to her boyfriend.<br>  <br>  first of all i would like to ask you some questions,<br>  <br>  1. did she know this guy for quite a while? or was he someone she randomly met and liked him and the guy asked her out and thats the reason they are going out?<br>  <br>  2. did you ever made any remarks or have spoken about her boyfriend? how do you act when she is around him? <br>  <br>  3. does she look like she is happy with him? do they look in love?<br>  <br>  alright iam gonna check to see if you put the answers in aditional details later on cause i really need to know that.<br>  <br>  ok so her boyfriend, how does he look like? do you think you are equally or better looking than he is? if so, then maybe you can "take him out". if you can only figure out what his weak spots are, you might be able to dilude her from him. i'll explain this once i get the answers from you.<br>  <br>  <br>  (extension)<br>  OK well thats good and bad. first off, as i imagined they randomly met and both liked each other and decided to go out. those kind of relationships usually never work. both of them rarely know each other well enough to be together for so long. i'd say give them a couple of months before they brake up. as to the way he looks, which u said he was better looking than you, thats the sole reason why she is with him. you stated that you were going to the gym to get build up, keep going and get your appearance improving. use him and her as a determination to accomplish what you want. when you go, remember that you are going there to be better looking than him and want to get the girl back, i will sure boost your mental morale.<br>  <br>  ok now lets continue, you have to do something about this guy. mmmmmm.......there are some "set-ups" that you can do yourself to cause them to brake up but they are rather too complicated and you would need assistance (like some friends and her friends to work with you).  but what you can do to take this guy out is to find his weaknesses. once you find out you can use that information against him. <br>  for example, if the guy is jealous and doesnt want other boys to be with her, you might want to hang out more close to her to piss him off, eventually he will start bragging about it to the girl, which will end up in a brake up. thats just one example, others that i've seen people do in my school is that they get a girl to kiss him all randomly while his girlfriend watches from afar, eventually she will think that he is cheating on him and again, resulting in a brake up. i could spent a day just writing examples here so iam gonna leave it up to your creativity to use which tactic best fits you.<br>  <br>  <br>  ok, well most importantly..DONT LET YOURSELF DOWN! u can do this buddy! dont give up! "theres only way, you gotta fight for what you believe in" - Larry Foulke.  if you love this girl so badly, nothing will stop you from your goal, which is being with her. just hang in there and dont give up<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you out here man, good luck with her|`|2nqmoerIaa	i don't want to hurt u but ur fault is that u waited to long to ask her out she liked u and u blew it dude she couldn't have waited for u forever rite and don't worry never no man dial her up and tell her right now best thin relationships don't last long do as i said and u will be fine<br>  <br>  Dom K|`|qdhZvL3caa	Be a man, hun. Ask her out.|`|14tr16uuaa	College is around the corner, it gets easier the less you have to see her.<br>  <br>  In all honesty though, why in the world didn't you just man up and ask her, she obviously cared about you and you left her hanging in the breeze! That's why she has a new boyfriend, she figured you didn't like her.<br>  <br>  Before you throw her away you should tell her the truth and then move on. It's not healthy to obsess like that.|`|Pnc775Oiaa	trust me on this you don't want to have that what if hanging over your head.  she could be the one so just go for it... and as for being heartbroken there is no cure for that trust me i know im 17 as well and had my heart broken by someone i loved.  Your just gonna slowly get over a broken heart..|`|Qvql4KGLaa	Son House but it perfectly, the blues is what happens between a man and a woman... go listen to the blues, and howl about the injustice women do to us. Women seem to objectify men by their wallets, Men objectify women by there bodies. Seems to me the second one is slightly more humane. But I say listen to the blues.
AA10776660	Meera bai's love was very different from what you and I have in our minds as the typical image of love. Her love was a mixture of devotion , and a sense of worship. It wasn't anything even close to romantic. And there is nothing wrong in devoting yourself completely to a thing which you believe is God , and the ultimate being. <br>  <br>  She pictured him as a perfect incarnation of God , and in a way , he was the person , without any flaws , and if people are to make themselves flawless , should see as an inspiration. In all her bhajans , she has never mentioned her romantic side. She has always mentioned how much she respects him , and how much she is amazed by his glory , and how much she admires him. <br>  <br>  She loved someone who existed in her own faith and belief. She created what he was for her. <br>  <br>  I think admiration can be for anyone , be it another human being , a God , or even for an animal. <br>  <br>  And what's the most wonderful and beautiful part of her love and devotion is that she used to respect and admire Radha and Krishna together. I think that says it all.
AXqmo8rlaa	You are a very kind and compassionate daughter....tell him how much you care about him and offer to go with him to a councilor who can help him deal with things and realize that there is happiness out there for him.<br>  Your support even if rejected at first will mean alot to  him and maybe make him think that if you care like that, there are others that do to and bring him around to getting himself back on the right track. Blessings to both of you.|`|a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	It sure sounds like you dad is very hurt. So to cope with so much hurt and pain, he turns to alcohol. If you want to help him, you tell him that you want him to get some help with his drinking problem that he has. You only can do so much for him. He has to want to get the help that he needs. Let him know how much you still love him and care for him and that you want to see him get well. If you cannot tell him face to face, then send him a letter instead. If he doesn't get the help that he needs, he will get worse.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Go and be there with him<br>  <br>  Alone = the worst|`|wBffQgPiaa	Tell your dad to find a support group or a counselor.    Tell him you love him and will support him but he has to find help for himself - you can't do it for him, and you are too young to have that burden.  You should be enjoying life right now at your age.<br>  <br>  divorcesupport.com is one of many online resources.<br>  <br>  Codependents Anonymous is also good.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to both of you.|`|cc64f7e4c9e3134ab80c47121bcd1125aa	let him vent to you or a psych|`|AA11626362	I'm  going through the biggest and hardest break-up for me right now so I can relate. What I do to try to get over it is when I feel like thinking about him I automatically tell myself (and do it now unvoluntarily) about WHY we're not together, why we couldn't work, why he and i left the relationship. Even if she left him, he needs to realize that she's not the only one out there. Think of all the bad, and in time when you're ready, keep some of the good memories with you too. Also he should learn from the relationship, how he works, how other people work, what you need, not to generalize every women, but every relationship teaches you something.|`|rsE1m7aOaa	take him out sometime and talk to him and let him know youre proud and you wouldnt change him for the world

Hard in what way?  Just in general there is nothing hard about white girls dating black men.  If either family is prejudiced then that can make it hard.  It actually is eye opening because that can make you see who you really need in your life and who you don't.  If family/friends can't respect your decision, then at some point you have to make a choice.  But that is with any relationship not just interracial ones.  I don't really understand what you meant by hard??????<br>  <br>  <br>  Like I said it does make it hard if the family is against interracial dating.  However, I think that if you are going to make a decision that you know has consequences, then you need to deal with it.  If a girl is going to date outside of her race and is comfortable with doing so, then she has to be able to put her foot down and not put up with bs from her family.  I personally had to cut my family off in order for them to accept it, and I have a son that is mixed.  I think it just depends on the person and how they can handle the situation personally.|`|YRJFo6K0aa	If they both care about and respect each other, between the two of them it shouldn't make a difference what race they are. It is possible that family, friends, or others could make things difficult by being unsupportive, but that could happen for any number of unrelated reasons. There are plenty of happily married couples who are from different racial or national backgrounds. So no, by no means is it always hard.|`|fsF2SSVHaa	i would assume that it is hard to live on food stamps, but i have no personal experience|`|iR7StHksaa	i think it depends on how you look and how you act.

NUWdgQuraa	He's your ex for a reason.  Don't get full of yourself.
Zjl9HRSTaa	I know how it feels to just want a boyfriend. I'm like that too. Its like the comfort of knowing you have someone there with you all the time. I mean he could have never told you about the girl he kissed. I think he honestly meant it when he said he was sorry or else he could have kept it to himself and you never would have known. But in all honestly I say leave him be. You WILL think about him. Thats inevitable. I mean if you decide to go to the same college then give it a shot, if not then leave him alone and just enjoy college life.|`|skSzDIlwaa	okay sweetie, all i can say is go for what your heart says. if you want to be with him then be with him and if you don't then don't be with him. its all just the matter of what your heart really wants. <br>  <br>  just talk to him about the whole cheating thing. also i would have to say it seems he still has feeling for you a lot that is why he doesn't last that long with other girl's. then grabbing your had and kissing you means he still really cares for you and wants to be with you still. well good luck and the best of luck to you two.|`|ef2904f23b858c736b0170be778e96d2aa	dont talk to him ever again hes stupid|`|1kLIrOG3aa	well when he was talking bout the whole college problem that was totally a ticket to get out of ur relationship. I think he can' control himself or something and u just kinda fell into the trap of maybe he is different. I dunno it truely is up to u but all i can say i do what u want cuz think about 10yrs from now, it all wont matter. Hope this helped! :>
wck4MHREaa	Stop talking to her. Now.<br>  <br>  That's your solution right there. If you still have feelings for her, even in the slightest, you need to end that relationship (or put it "on hiatus" for a while). It's completely unhealthy to do that, since you'll be miserable seeing her (or hearing about her) with her boyfriend, and that's not fair for you.<br>  <br>  Remember, you need to look out for yourself in this world first and foremost. Give yourself time and space away from the girl to clear your head, and when you feel like you've gotten over it, then you can open up to her again.|`|wEUCXq7Caa	it is a little difficult.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	don't pay attention to anything they say.
U2gVd9pFaa	He probably like you, but gets nervous around you.  He prob doesnt know if you like him either.|`|jR1Tu0bPaa	he wants you but he is shy... make the first move...|`|AA11102607	he means he has a crush on you|`|XLC3QDQ9aa	HE LIKES YOU.|`|qTV7JvwTaa	OK it sounds harsh but ur bro and u r both right. I am a dude so take my word. He wants to "hit it and quit it", or rather "hump it and dump it". He isnt interested in a relationship but he is leading you on, like ur bro says, but he is nervous and cant look you in the eye like you said.|`|YyCJ5NmCaa	it means you're 15 and don't need to be worrying about crap like boys.

Qb3aQv7Baa	Wear a nurse outfit and inspect your bf's parts in various kinky ways
5V976X8jaa	no, liking clingy girls means that you have an exceptionally large need for attention and to have to feel needed/loved, which is always bad.<br>  see a therapist before any more of the dumb c*nts you probably date
xrq4qKRbaa	I think it's the issues caring over from your family situation.<br>  All I can say is you can not go through life not trusting anyone.<br>  Your father cheated not your boyfriend and yes your father cheated on you as well. In fact he did it to the whole family. There's so much more I could say about that but no sense beating a dead horse when he's down. Just because your dad did what he did don't judge others by your fathers actions. You need to take each and every person for who they are and what they stand for. It's ok to be aware of the possible signs of someone cheating and you now have a skill to help you out by knowing the signs that you have learned from your experience. You need to give him the benefit of the doubt. Do not accuse till you have facts. This text may have been a person he doesn't want anything to do with and to him it may have been a waste of time to even open the text.  Why don't you talk to him? If you want your relationship to go any further then communication will be the key to its success.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Tell him that if he's serious about you two, the only *hair color* beauty in his phone better be you.|`|TH4fwLgOaa	just make a spacial talk with him, like tell him how you feel about ur dad,and all and how you think its wrong. mayb he'll get it.

U will really see how things go after that....either she likes to hang out with you or not. <br>  <br>  sometime you cant really tell thats where its hard...second, get her number---get if only from her of course and u really need this step to complete phase 2 haha.....once you have her number just text her a lot, maybe she will get annoyed maybe not...but assume she doesn't until she speaks/texts up. <br>  <br>  If the steps above be completed please proceed haha... keep talking though ok and you will soon be able to get into more personal stuff and it will be wayyyyy easier to ask her out..|`|T5RHCYgNaa	If your thinking you want to be friends then it sounds to me like someone just wants some action. Don't do it if you only want sex.

If not, then don't. It may only tempt you on something that will cause your destruction (if you know what i mean). Love is supposed to wait. You should not love just to have one, but love because you know she's the right one, at the right time, at the right place. When you're in a relationship you're not sure if it'll work, don't give everything to the girl, and limit your love, because there is a possibility that you gave everything to just a mere stone, and left nothing to give to the right gem. God bless on your love life.|`|3d7rK5Z4aa	Well if you're having second thoughts then you're unsure and if you're unsure hold off until you've made up your mind so you don't waste your time and her time.

vw201sblaa	dude, if you need a roomate to pay the bills, you do what you got to do, whether its a man a woman, a gay man, a lesbian, kermit the frog, a kkk member, or anything else, if you need the money, you need the money. BUT if you have the option of a male or a female, since you have a girl, you should get a guy roommate if possible, the reasons being are guys get along easier than a guy and girl, do you want to get stuck listening to girly music, watching girly tv shows, and seeing girly feminine products all around the bathroom? guys can share the same things, watch the same shows, listen to the same music, just easier to get along with.... but you only want a girl roommate if you and she are single, or if the money is needed that badly...|`|kk9zVc9waa	Dude drop her,if she lived with a guy and a lez and wont let you its because things happened you dont know about and thats why she not cool with you doing it.You have already lied about your roomate to her anyway now when you do tell her  she will assume the worst and distrust will blossom into deceit,when that happens the relationship is doomed.|`|Sih0xHJgaa	wtf...I can understand how your girl friend feels perfectly. I think that's kind of odd to say the least for a guy who has a girl friend of 5 years to suddenly want/have a room mate that's a girl. Just because you would be ok with her having a guy as a room mate doesn't mean that she should be ok with you having a girl as a room mate; it doesn't work that way man. Suck it up.
mbsj4ggEaa	okay heres what I would do you need to make sure that she knows you really like and I mean you show her that you care so much more then he ever will and you will be the best boyfriend and just keep being there for me she'll wise up soon enough...good luck...hope this helps!
1LSX48vHaa	Finding hot girls online can be a bit of a tricky task, yes there are millions of them but actually finding a real site can be hard, sometimes they even cost money! the site below is free, and you can find the girls closest to you...free also.
cbmkx5Joaa	I would give her time to get over her ex. You don't want to be her rebound. <br>  Once you feel she is ready I think it is best to talk to her face to face since you are best friends. It sounds scary, but it is the most sincere way to talk to her about how you feel. She may be scared to lose the great friendship you two have, so assure her that the friendship is a great basis for the relationship since I'm sure you know her flaws and she knows yours. :)|`|RiStkJT9aa	face to face even though you ask her out it wouldnt effect your friendship because ive known many people that are best friends and had gone out with each other and are still best friends.|`|ef2904f23b858c736b0170be778e96d2aa	she would say NO but who knows uhhhhh tell her face to face give it a shot but if she says no....its gonna be akward after u know...and give her some times.

Your friend stabbed you in the back. And I really think that was a wake up call cause girl, I'm 15 and seriously  at least use a condom. Me and my boyfriend have only dated for two months and are nowhere near having sex. I guess we're different but you shouldnt rush things like that girl. You two are just gonna get sick of each other faster.|`|NVdf3uAEaa	1. STOP SLEEPING WITH GUYS UNTIL YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO EVEN CARRY RESPONSIBILITY FOR A KID. <br>  <br>  2. WTF are you dating a guy when you clearly still have feelings for your ex!?<br>  <br>  3. Stop having it all about guys. Maybe you've had enough of heart trauma. I say do your best to forget about them both. Change your phone # or block their calls. Focus on your studies and show him you don't need him or that slutty best friend of yours<br>  <br>  <br>  & LAST BUT NOT LEAST....<br>  <br>  <br>  4. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOUR PARENTS DURING ALL THIS TIME!? WHY IN GOD'S NAM WOULD THEY LET HIM SLEEPOVER. DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAVING SEX AND THAT YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT? No; they probably don't because if they did you wouldn't be posting this question for help... you'd be grounded for life.
XLC3QDQ9aa	One, coming from a man knowing this they are lazy. <br>  <br>  [this is my husband answering your question]|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	it must be in your head that your all out pleasing them, because it you WERE they would do everything possible to please you to keep you.|`|FN0rGZB6aa	because the man shouldnt even bother about getting off i mean in my opinion id rather have the girl get off than me but in an ideal situation like if im going a long time and i can get the girl to pop ill time it so we pop at the same time girls now a days if there not a freak dont like to give head but i only give head to girls im  in love with so far only 3 and thats will be the only girls id ever do it for inless that girl did it for me but when it comes down to it you have to think about the girls needs more than yours
c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	usually it has to do with how their relationships were with their fathers, but its not uncommon for females to have crushes on older men, it's just a phase most go through if they are younger (minors). and if it goes onto their late teens/early twenties, then its just the type of man they prefer, my friend is talking to an older man simply because hes got alot less hassle than most of the guys who are in their 20s.|`|NkmRiYqfaa	how old is your friend?<br>  it may be because there more mature.|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Well the biggest reason that anyone could tell u that has ever picked up a psychology book is that women are 2 years more metally mature then guys their same age. So add some more years and that means more maturity and life experience.|`|GA8uInKDaa	I am attracted to older men too, mid 30s. They are matured and stable. They do not play games like younger men and are straight to the point.|`|ACksTjZIaa	one word: Maturity<br>  guys always act about 15 yrs younger than they are ahaha<br>  women like to find men who are situated and have a strong head on their shoulders. 50s seems way too old though
3TjiJls7aa	ehhh its not all that matters, but sure its part of it|`|E7TkNO00aa	No, but what are you talking about?|`|JUjsPvNVaa	size doesnt matter to me really. i mean if its too big, i mean... ouch! lol|`|LmH5jZxkaa	no. strange as it sounds its quality not quantity<br>  as long as you're effective that's what mostly matters
GA8uInKDaa	I think you looking at the wrong places and conduct the way you speak and behave so guys won't get the wrong idea|`|0vo7tDP5aa	evolutionary psychology. its not a coincidence... the alpha males, and the confident types attract girls like no other. the nice guys, are, well. nice (and boring)...  they can watch from the sidelines.
vqdNEtYPaa	I live this with my daughters mother.  She hates me.  I am evil.  I am the lowest of the low.  I am the cause of everything that has ever gone wrong in her life.  In reality all I did was left her.  She was manipulative and controlling and I realized I couldn't live with someone like that.  So, I have spent the past 14 years being "punished".  I've tried to reason with her but she's not interested in what's best for our daughter.<br>  <br>  It's about having control.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Most want to keep the Father out of the child's life so they can collect welfare, subsidized housing, food stamps and all the other goodies offered with the Father isn't around. The Father doesn't usually mind because he doesn't want to pay child support anyway. At least that is how it works in my city.|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	27 yrs later I still cannot understand that behavior pattern.<br>  <br>  There is always to sides to every story, unfortunately, it is much weaselier to blame the father - as is customary. <br>  <br>  To this spouses I ask, what did you do to make your other 1/2 walk away in the first place?<br>  <br>  I cannot speak of maltreatment, yet I have seen it around and me and believe it or not, at one point, my current 1/2 at one point tried to pull me away and after one serious chat, we are still deciding if we belong together - 25 yrs later..|`|DS21ekeJaa	That is not the case for me, I welcome my children's father into their lives in what ever way he can be there. But then, I am a mature female that remembers the reasons why we had children together in the first place! <br>  That being said, the women I am acquainted with that push the father away when he wants involvement have done so for the following reasons:<br>  1 They wanted to have a new relationship with another man and wanted him to be the father figure so they could feel like a real family. <br>  2. One wanted to move out of state for convenience reasons, so sought sole custody so she could do so. <br>  3. Several just couldn't stand the thought of having to see the father because of personal emotional issues and couldn't put those reasons on the back burner long enough to swap the child for visitation times.|`|RtkB46peaa	After having children, some women put their kids above their husbands.  So much so, that their husbands take a back seat to everything else in his wife's life.  He's expected to look out for himself, as she is "busy with the kids" and doesn't have the time for him.  Many women have even said that they don't have time for "another kid", calling their husband a child simply because he wants the love and respect he deserves from the relationship.  <br>  <br>  This sort of selfishness is an detriment to the entire family.  It puts the father in an absolutely terrible situation in which he's feels he's competing with his children for his wife's love and affection.<br>  <br>  A couple should stay a couple whether the children come along or not.  The parents relationship must come first.  A happy, loving couple can much more strongly love and nurture their children.  It will teach the children how to have a healthy, loving relationship, in the hopes that they'll mimic these values in future relationships of their own.<br>  <br>  You often here guys talk about how their wives no longer give a rip about them because they now have children to love.  Talk about backwards.|`|djUMvICoaa	I feel it kind of strange that you put it about the mothers that way, I had the feeling from my readings that they were having trouble engaging the fathers into their lives, guess I must be reading different questions than you.  But if you want to make sense of anything you have to put yourself through the wringer a few times and get a chip on your shoulder like these women must have.  They can't see straight any more because they feel cheated, lied to and the rest and end up trying for revenge using the kids as weapons.  Yes it's childish but these women if you can call them that have no better way of resolving issues around them.  They will also be some of those mothers who have trouble keeping their kids out of trouble because they were to immature to have learned good manners themselves.  It becomes a viscous circle.|`|LQISGYbEaa	I really don't think there is an epidemic of mothers arbitrarily denying their children's fathers access to them. <br>  You're kind of ridiculous.|`|BK59At37aa	honestly you may not like my answer but you never really know any ones situation be it past or present. Obviously they feel that they're decision is the best one|`|Grt0HdLYaa	I am 22 and have a 7 month old son from an unintended pregnancy with an ex-boyfriend. <br>  <br>  To be honest, it would be much easier for me if the father was out of the picture. <br>  <br>  Why? <br>  <br>  It's another person to have child rearing conflict with, another family to potentiate drama, an ex with the inevitable feelings and drama that accompanies interaction with all exes..plus he is selfish, dishonest, unreliable, just a whole host of negative personality traits. <br>  <br>  However..I would never impede contact between my son and his dad, because I know it's not in my son's best interest, though it is in mine.|`|Wj212FWXaa	you know what i think? some women are just crazy and selfish.  of course the majority have legit reasons to keep thier baby-daddies away from their kids, others are just crazy and use it as a form of punishment for various offenses that in no way involve their child.  i think its unfair that women can do that to get back at men bc can the men do that?  no.  the double standard is rediculous here.  and who ends up suffering in these cases?  not just the father, but more importantly the child who now has to live alone with the crazy b****.<br>  <br>  its just like why do some women choose to "accidently" get pregnant to "save" a relationship?  they trap the men so they cant leave them by using an innocent child as a weapon.<br>  <br>  honestly, i firmly and wholeheartedly believe that you should need to apply for a license to have children, just like you have to take drivers ed.  as soon as you find out you are pregnant, you should have to take a parenting course by the time the baby is born or it goes into foster care until you do.  bc the way i see it, some people just should NOT have children bc they do not know what to do with them.  its a child, not a pet or an accessory.|`|a4eae7763718d60503d3ecc788178132aa	It seems that way..I'm a teacher and work with most all women and the conversations I have heard in the restroom confirm what you say. I have overheard other teachers refer to their kid's father as a "sperm donor" and I have heard them say "I'll make sure he pays the rest of his life" (they were not referring to money but to emotional hurt.)<br>  And I get to look into the little faces of the little children who are suffering the loss of one or the other parent. Children have the right to be parented by both parents; to be loved by both and not to have to decide which one to love more in order to make the other parent happy.<br>  We are just killin our kids!<br>  There are a lot of dads out there who are better parents than their spouses too.<br>  Join a group which support joint custody and fights PAS (parent alienation syndrome)|`|ise05jjUaa	Edit:  I might add that his children don't even want to see him because they see what their mother goes through.  Well until you've lived in every single mother's shoes I wouldn't judge anyone.  Right now you're still living that life of a "fairy tale" where everything is perfect.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit:  It is going to court.  And this isn't a story, stories are made up.  As far as fathers who will help financially yes I would agree to him seeing the children.  I think maybe some women may just be mad at the father & its a personal vedetta that has nothing to do with the kids.  So for those women who do that, no that's not right.|`|kTUL01tfaa	I notice the same thing, they do everything sexually they can to trap a guy and get pregnant then afterwards they drop the guy and move away or find stupid reasons to keep him away, its all 'power'. dragging the poor kid through man after man, asking on here why does my new b.f. consider my kid baggage?<br>     i stayed with my husband many years, my son grew up with his dad around everyday & has many wonderful memories,  don't use the man as only a sperm donater, we are not animals. children need their fathers.|`|u1onvWmraa	Well, my first instinct is that the mother is afraid the father will disappear with the child but is afraid to admit it. Because it would make it real or he could find out she was telling people that and take her to court. <br>  <br>  Some women also are selfish, only wanting the men for their sperm and once they have it, they will do whatever it takes to get the man out of their lives. It doesn't matter to some women if the man wants anything to do with the child or not. <br>  <br>  My question to you is: why do you care what someone else does in their life? Does it affect you? Not being mean, just wondering.
RiStkJT9aa	well girls underwear size goes by 2s so you would be 8 or 10 and then go higher by 2 if those dont fit|`|Nqda6ulSaa	try them on or buy a undie in each size|`|x1FzJLwZaa	measure your waist then then there is a range in every size
9TAHh7tjaa	well to me he doesnt sound like a keeper<br>  i would say just break up with him but 4 years is a long time<br>  you two should talk and see where he stands in the relationship if he needs to 'evaluate'<br>  sorry i couldnt help much<br>  but good luckk with all that :D|`|N39uQiZMaa	Hmmm, to me he just likes to be with you because of something. He doesn't talk to you kids and he doesn't even talk to you when you said you love him. He doesn't love you, I'm sorry. Why did I came to this?  When you were ready to put your relationship to the next level, he seems to be having second thoughts, or maybe he disagrees. He just told you, "I'll evaluate first our relationship" meaning he just want to break you slowly. Somehow, he did this because he feels a little guilty. Guilty because he feigned on you relationship just to have something he desires and now that you really love, he just can't see you in agony. But he doesn't want to be with you, so he just told you he'll think about it for your relationship to decay a little and to hide his passion of just using you. If your relationship degraded, he will then break up with you. That's it. <br>  <br>  This is what I can see from the details you gave me. Protect yourself and think about your children rather than worrying about your relationship. That's it. God bless you.|`|GelbRB8qaa	If this man is not willing to accept and embrace your past, I'd say kick him to the curb.  <br>  <br>  Maybe that's a bit harsh, I know.  But this problem will most likely only recur in the years to come.  It sounds like he wants nothing to do with your children (most likely because they are not his)<br>  <br>  I have several friends who behave in the same manner.  It disgusts me, to tell you the truth. <br>  <br>  Let him know that it's a package deal.  Life will become entirely filled with tension and stress if you let the problem continue.  Not worth it, my dear.|`|pLtNcCqgaa	go with your gut, on it...|`|pG9cufuHaa	Well hun,<br>  I have dated a girl or 2 with a kid, and I think he is just being an ***.. He should talk to your kids now.. I mean 4 yrs and he ain't never talked to em?? that ain't normal and quite weird, and if he is one of those people that does not seem to like kids, kinda hard on your relationship when they are yours.. I mean like I said, I never had a problem cuz I like kids (and not no perv way for anybody who is gonna blow it outta context) but I especially liked em because they were part of the woman I was with.. As of terms for a break-up, maybe if he don't shape up.. I mean I am a guy thats how I would feel if I was you (like I said, I have dated some women who had a kid or 2, didn't bother me none..) hope this helps.

7ypRtqAGaa	Ummm, isn't this a good thing ??<br>  I don't understand, why would you want girls <br>  to look in your private areas ? would that make you feel<br>  more confident ? who told you that girls are supposed to <br>  do this at parties ?? relax lol don't think about that and don't always think about sex. get to know girls !|`|0lQtTE9Daa	This delema that you seem to have encountered comes as a direct result of you being a raging homosexual who asks questions like this one on Yahoo Answers.|`|YyCJ5NmCaa	Maybe because at THOSE parties the girls are NOT whores you D-bag.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	no point. they don't have a magnifying glass with them.|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	maybe it is so big they are overwhelmed by the site of it|`|QlvcSgn0aa	why the hell would they? lol|`|P5NLWp84aa	do you just flash them?|`|reFCzUnwaa	perhaps there's something wrong with you??/ if not then was stopping u from making the 1st move
c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	It happens, but its not always the thing, sometimes what wind up happening with a girl is she wind up with their friends or something until they figure out that some of these guys just aren't all about them, the reason some tend to go to the "under dogs" is because in a relationship there can't really be two people who are all about themselves, it just wont work out.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	they SAY they are tired of them. yet it is in their nature to be attracted to the alpha male types. typically those idiots exhibit many of the characteristics of what attracts girls.
mVUpt8waaa	He probably does like you and since his girlfriend is not around he got tempted but then he realised he needed to back off.  So I dont think you should contact him, wait for him to contact you if he still wants to be friends.
Uj5kuzoJaa	You can try to bring it up in a different manner. Instead of telling him that he needs to work out, why not ask him if he wants to go for a walk with you? Tell him that you want to start walking on a regular basis and you would really like it if he joined you. Or see if he'll start bike riding with you. Find a cool path around your neighborhood and see if he'll come with you. Has he ever shown an interest in Rock Climbing? Try to find a sport that he actually enjoys doing. If you find something that he likes to do, then your problem will be solved. He probably doesn't like the idea of going to a gym, so find something he'll like to do. You could even join him if you wanted.|`|aj7bsLEsaa	You could try talking to one of his friends to get him to workout. Guys usually hate being told what to do by a girl.. a word from a guy may do the trick. Hope everything works out!|`|AA10776535	Stop pushing him and he will figure out he needs to do these things...Anytime you try to mother someone they will do the opposite out of spite.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	A guy hates being told what to do. He needs motivation. 'motivate' him.
HgRp7xa8aa	You should definitely go and tell him how you feel. You never know. Plus he may be dating someone else because he thinks he can't have you, especially since you broke up with him... so go for it.|`|5YVDbOWCaa	ya
aLgY4l3Naa	Sit down with your girl and let her know how you feel, be very honest about were you stand in the relationship, don't leave anything for her to second guess, and let her know you feel its best that you both move on!! There is no way your going to be able to avoid hurt feelings for either one of you, but if your not happy there is no reason to stay, given time you both will heal from this and be able to move on in life!! Good luck to you and i hope everything works out for the best!!|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	You want to stick around someone who blackmails you because she's unstable? Try it--Lonely is better than that. RUN!!!|`|x1FzJLwZaa	how old are you to see that you could never marry her?<br>  <br>  anyway just asking..<br>  <br>  if wanna end it then just end it, make her understand why and let her know you still wanna be friends.
Tu7UOK3Waa	to be honest it depends on the guy..<br>  <br>  but you could put your head on his chest when you are hugging, that would show a lot..trust me
x1FzJLwZaa	tell him if he doesn't grow balls and take you back you cant wait and you would go on a date like right now and he cant stop you well unless you want him to stop you.|`|YE0baNYRaa	there is no need for you to wait. coz if he wanted he would have asked you out earlier. you carry on with your life and stop worrying about how he feels if ure on a date.|`|GVVoTtp8aa	Umm He's obviously dateing other people, but doesnt want you to. Keep your eyes open chicka. If he's not asking you back out, i'd go on a date with someone else. That'll either make him reveal what he's doing or take you back. Either way, i dont think i'd go back out with him.|`|XCdNscFqaa	if he wanted u back he would have done it already, and if u go on another date he might just get jealous and try and get u back just out of jealousy so i would say move on.|`|7xsJHSGTaa	it sounds like YOU are the one who needs to talk to him. ask him out again!!!!! you LOVE him.|`|HQb4wL1Eaa	He does not know what he wants and he know you will stick around so he can have the best of both worlds tell him you know what i love you and im going to go on dates with other guys and enjoy my life and when your ready to have a relationship let me know and depending on where i am in my life maybe we can work things out. A guy will drag you on for as long as you let him. You need to make him realize you are not a toy and you will not let him play with your emotions. Be strong and tell him your done waiting.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|3dgaaVNlaa	yeah if you really love him just go kiss him. but you dont want to go on the other date because it would look like you were "sleeping around" (not meant to be offensive not meant to be taken literally, just a figure of speech) but just tell him how you feel.|`|KRPZ5u6Paa	Why aren't you dating right now..? Breaks are for people who don't know if they want to be with the other person. If you know, you should be with him. The fact that you're not together sorta says that one of you doesn't really know. It sounds like it's not you.  Break it off for good.|`|qdhZvL3caa	Ask him about what the two of you are going to do. Are you guys getting back together or staying friends? Ask him that. & make him choose one or the other because no girl likes to be left confused, yadidamean?|`|T7cMVP03aa	there's probably something behind all this ..<br>  try to find out or be patient, he's right ... hang on|`|1nHTQxq8aa	Waiting around is the worst thing you can do for him and yourself, Just to let you know, he's stringing you along.  He wants you to be there whenever he needs you to and he doesn't care as much about you or else you two would be dating.  The more you wait the longer this is going to go on and you will never be happy.  Its like he keeps you safe and warm in his back pocket so that he can take you out whenever he wants to play with you, so to speak.  If you were to let him know your tired of waiting for him and come to you when he is ready, it won't take him very long to realize he wants 100% of you and not just %80 that is if he loves you as much as he says.  Not trying to be brutal but I've been there. for your own mental health id say don't wait, you will be much happier and maybe even find a guy that you don't need to wait around for
shH9tGpYaa	If you're artistic or want a creative challenge, make some sort of collage for her, with a message that she can decode.  You could also write out 7 (or 8. One for each month) lines of prose that describe why each month with her was important to you.  But, haha, those might be too sappy for you, so maybe sending her flowers or a musical card would be nice.  Good luck!|`|MQVmh5hiaa	O.k you should meet with her one day and go to a place that makes her feel that she is comfortable and tell her how you truly feel about her and that you want her to know how actually feel.|`|AwyL5nBuaa	if anything, do it in person.<br>  it means more.<br>  but, do something wild and courageous !<br>  Drive to her house and tell her to jump in your car. <br>  then take her somewhere private and tell her how you feel <br>  do something fun with her<br>  take her <br>  -rock climbing<br>  -to the city<br>  -and so on|`|FgaCqM2qaa	You should hit her in the head and then have sex with her... and when she wakes up... you yell SURPRISE!

zka26204aa	Maybe they are great for you, but he feels as if he is missing something.  Talk with him about it.  Make him understand that you do not mind him watching a little porn, but when it starts taking over your sex life, you are concerned.  I am sure that by talking about it the two of you can work something out.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could try some surprises with some imaginative adventure, such as dressing in sexy nurse's costumes, etc... or adding some "toys", or some romantic baths.  I even hung porn pictures all around the room, with candlelight, Champagne and sexy oils one night.  It was absolutely fantastic!  He did not expect it, so it turned out to be a great evening.<br>  <br>  Also, try to remember that sometimes he may be stressed or tired from work.  Although he still wants sex, the effort he has to make with you may be more than he physically or mentally has the energy for.  On those days, porn is just easier.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|kHRD7uUAaa	its hard to suggest something to someone that is shallow get a grip young girl your husband has a problem and your attitude of being in denial won't help.  And sex may not be everything but when you are young and active its really important and you have to resolve the issue or it get worse and eventually you will divorce so its either now or later.|`|vffZ3is4aa	What are you doing to turn him on?when are you trying to get him in the sack? is he tired?<br>   Try waking him up early for a quicky, wake him up with your hand or mouth on his tool. hop on and go for a ride. use him, but don't abuse him. wake him up on Saturday morning and spend several hours doing it,|`|xQGCf8GGaa	there might be some reason<br>  speak with him about it<br>  tell him ur feelings too<br>  it will help u|`|aLgY4l3Naa	I think its great your not thinking of divorce like most people do, hands up to ya, its always better to deal with problems head  on!! Well i would say that you need to sit down with him and let him honestly know how your feeling, don't leave anything for him to guess about, put it out there on the table and go from there! I would also address the issue of the porn, there maybe a problem there that you don't realize, truly my point of view is, its very disrespectful for a man to do this kind of stuff when he has a partner, very degrading and and lack of respect for you!! Dealing with these things will take communication and commitment from both of you to do the right thing because you love each other, that means considering each others feelings before your own!! If need be i would also suggest marriage counseling, sometimes its easier to get through to your partner with a neutral person there to help you guys out, so give it a try but don't give up, stay positive things will get better!! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!!|`|iPje1iyGaa	He may be developing an unhealthy addiction to porn.  Talk to him about how you are feeling, instead of just hinting at it.  As much as we (women) like to think we are being SUPER obvious, men don't always pick up on our hints. If this is the case (he's not picking up on your hints) he may be turning to porn because he doesn't realize that you would like sex as often as you actually do.|`|mcUSz16kaa	Here are a few of my thoughts and suggestions.  <br>  <br>  Thoughts:<br>  <br>  The male species was evolved and brought up to be the provider..With him being in his mid 20s, he has a lot of years ahead for him to keep thinking he has to be the provider (if this is the case). Therefore, he could be subconsciously under stress & under pressure which is probably putting a damper on his sex drive. You need to find out what is really bothering him. Could it be his career, finances, kids in the future..etc?  Help him release this pressure by talking about it with him..<br>  <br>  Was he looking at porn before you got married? He could  enjoy voyeurism, and just can't help it. <br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  <br>  If you haven't or already doing so:<br>  <br>  -Keep yourselves both fit and healthy.  <br>  -Keep the household orderly, neat and balanced (coming home to an organized environment reduces stress) <br>  -Watching hot porn videos together might turn him on.   <br>  -Go out on hot dates to get him in the mood.<br>  -Quit hinting about wanting to have sex.. wear something sexy and masturbate in front of him when you are in the mood. Talk dirty & tell him what you want and need from him. Hopefully he will join in and help you out .  If not, then at least you will have your needs satisfied  :)<br>  -When he is watching porn, turn it into positive experience for the both of you, instead of having it irritate you. It should be a great time to interrupt him & get sensual with him.  Whisper something sexy in his ear, kiss his neck and caress your body against his. Hopefully, you can entice him enough so that his fantasies become physical and intimate with you instead of what's on the screen. <br>  - Hug and kiss him when he gets home or when you get home..Thus, keep the attractions you have for each other  alive. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|rSNejsfvaa	me n my guy are having the same problem but im lucky if i get it twice in a month im so fed up with it that i threatnen to leave him alone i give him some blows and he loves it n that would make him more into our sex life but it doesnt my advice would be watch porn with him n give him a blow then do some of the things that are on the videos another thing that u should do is buy like langerie and some creams, jellies toys something to have fun with it might work|`|03rggPF2aa	make him choose, you or porn. tell him if he doesnt make you a priority you wont sleep with him. then he'll want it. trust me. its like playing hard to get. he wants what he cant have, right? so make him work for it.|`|yfGmTP8Eaa	how was sex before you got married? talk to him about it that is the best thing. Buy nice lingerie make romantic dinners or things that you know It will get in the mood. Most important talk to him :)|`|gESIXVOSaa	well hop on a x rated website and try to look like the girl on their. maybe he'll start looking at you more and not them. <br>  <br>  it's not that hard...fluffy long hair, lots and lots of makeup, seductive outfits...|`|4wmbnr3Saa	its called marriage thats what makes it blah!|`|GIsmTQr9aa	Try to get him out of porn ASAP. That's what's killing it. And it will happen more frequently if you don't do it right away. See, we men have a very sexual mind, unfortunately our body doesn't always respond the way we would like it to and right now he is finding Comfort in porn. Is very psychological. Instead of the ********, ask him to read an erotic novel with you.|`|bSChe6Tgaa	I am pretty much going through the same thing except the porn part. You need to talk with him about that. Let him know that it is interfering with you guys. Let him know how you feel. I think it is weird for a man in his 20's to not want sex at least 2 times a week. For us it's the other way around but we have a baby that takes up a lot of our time and the bc I am on isn't helping  much either. Well hang in there things will work out but you gotta let him know.<br>  <br>  why am I getting thumbs down? I feel for her and am trying to give the best advice I can.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	First of all he is lucky to be married to you.  You sound like my wife.  It is GREAT that you are totally committed to your marriage.  <br>  <br>  The truth is that if he didn't watch porn, and didn't use his hands to please himself, when he had sex with you it would be much more intense for him, because he would have "built up" his desire.  <br>  <br>  See if you can get him to try to give up the porn for 1 month and during that time he only gets to "finish" with you.  Tell him to try it.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Unless he sees it as a problem, it's going to get worse before it gets better. Nothing good ever comes from an addiction, and if he's not a porn addict yet, he soon will be. Counselling, if you can get him there could be an early intervention to that. But he has to see it is a problem.|`|LUhh9bSWaa	Only 1 year and its already suckin?|`|M3pjhIecaa	depends what he does for a living, sometimes you get in and you don't want the hassle of initiating anything however, if you took the initiative you'd get a reaction everytime hints tend to go unheeded if you've just had a c...p day and want to just chill and wind down. <br>  On the other hand he may be doing the sites for some fantasy which you'll have to find out about and use to your benefit.|`|RtkB46peaa	Why on earth are you "hinting".  Dress sexy, and walk up to him, and say "How about I give you a nice sloppy BJ?"  Then half way through, climb on.  Make sure you're vocal about what you like and what gets you off.<br>  <br>  He sounds like he's a bit insecure about sex with you.  Many men don't feel like they're pleasing their women, and it makes sex stressful.  Porn, well, porn is easy with absolutely no stress.  That's the point of porn, though.|`|rQfzifT7aa	I think all couple who are married for a long time go through this. There will be dry spells.<br>  <br>  When you first met, it was great right? It is not as great as it once was for you so you know it's not for him.<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it. You don not want to lose communication with him. When you lose that, you might as well say the relationship is over. So talk, do not be afraid to tell him how you feel and let him respond. Don't get upset at what he tells you. When you each tell each other the problem, the both of you should ask the other.. okay how can I fix it.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons why he may not was it as frequent. He may be tired, stressed or wanting something more. <br>  Get in there and watch the tv with him.
vqdNEtYPaa	I think the answer depends a lot on the man.  I'm in my mid 30's now and what I'd consider a good gf is a lot different now then in my late 20's and even more different than in my early 20's.  Back then a good gf was one who would go down on me regularly.  That's about all the thought I put into it.  Now days I require a bit more.  I hold out for smart women with a good sense of humor.  I also like a woman who can keep a conversation going.  I'm not interested in being changed so I also need a woman who isn't looking for a boyfriend they can mold into their dream guy.  <br>  As for a good relationship.  That's easy.  Meet the right type of person and the relationship can't be anything other than good.
JhvqUvlsaa	Ask his parents what might be causing this; tell them you are really concerned and wish he could be happy again and see what they say; this might get the ball rolling on his parents intervening and helping him regain his joy again. =)|`|VkfwCBfmaa	Just continue what you're doing. You're doing the right thing by being there for him. Continue to try to talk to him at least once a day, and always smile and say hi if you pass him by. There's probably a good reason why he's depressed, and you can't force it out. Maybe he won't tell you what was wrong until a long time later, or maybe he'll never tell you, but don't underestimate your efforts because he might secretly be very, very grateful for you.
ss5vAWKSaa	Every girl is a little different.  You may have been just right.  Just ask her.  She might want spanked or something to put her over the top.|`|7Icg8uKraa	Spread ice cream all over her back.... and start licking it off.|`|UUmtygTEaa	this is probably the dumbest comment you will ever read, but be careful with her. she and her parents could sue you for sex. why? b/c you're an adult and she's "underage."<br>  <br>  and a tip for sex, go harder. seriously, go harder. and if you think it's still not enough, always do more.|`|b5eea40f57d17edc2a9efb9e5f8bc417aa	hahaha "sniper"^^^|`|hAXDWhiVaa	go down on her. most women get their best orgasms from clitoral stimulation.|`|jB1Dp8DWaa	the only thing i gotta say is:<br>  there comes a time in every man's life when he has to use his penis
YT4LGXiWaa	Hmmm. This seems impossible. With you're parents always checking up on you it will be tough to get an excuse for 10 hours. Maybe you can meet him somewhere so you wont be away as long.<br>  <br>  An excuse like working on a project or something can only help you for a couple of hours.
uzNiVy3yaa	pedofile!!! ewwww!!! find someone ur own age!!!! gahhhhhh >_<|`|lIcKd8Hdaa	ok so first, you should get her to notice you, look at her when you think shes not looking, then look away real quick so she just gets a glance of you staring at her. <br>  <br>  Befriend her on facebook, if she or you have one.<br>  <br>   Let her be naturally attracted to you, play hard to get and mysterious, then go on and talk to her.<br>  <br>   Ask her about her life and tell about your own as u talk. Give her compliments.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helped! :) good luck|`|1jQ0EiFYaa	im a yr7 girl so i should be able to give u some advice.<br>  first talk to her <br>  about somert like music idunno then like meet her at lunch times for a while and just try and bring out a convo then go for it ask her out its as easy as that but first try build a good friendship|`|okxexs04aa	Just be yourself,
ae06239e62818780ae57b9ae07468d3caa	Honestly, if she's interested she'll come to you. Otherwise leave her alone. She has made it obvious that she is no longer interested. Continuing to chase her will only make you look stalkerish and clingy, neither of which are attractive traits.<br>  <br>  Since she says that she wants to be friends she has probably moved on. She gave it a shot with you and decided that she just liked you as a friend after all. Texting her every now and then is fine, but you've pretty much been friend-zoned.<br>  <br>  I would try to move on and date other girls.|`|bLXmuGoJaa	wow  well what u should do is confront her and tell her you love her and you want to be together or you can send her like flowers and chocolates as her secret admirer and then tell her thet its you<br>  <br>  good luck and hope i helped|`|C8v47HIGaa	Desperate much? ....pathetic much? move on man..|`|Ry77jN0qaa	Seriously, you are acting like a stalker.  She is over you completely and is trying not to be a ***** to you.<br>  <br>  Get the hint and move on.|`|KI4NieoTaa	Keep in touch with her. prove to her how much you love her, but dont lay it on to much.<br>  <br>  And hope that she realises, your better then him.<br>  <br>  Sorry not much of a help. <br>  <br>  (:|`|rPZFgiwLaa	projectdefy,<br>  <br>  I suspect that you're hurting from this girl and you're having a hard time letting go.  From reading your posting, you appear to be insecure as you're too focused on getting back with this girl.  By her using the old "I need a break" line is a hint that she's afraid to hurt your feelings and she's just not interested in you anymore.<br>  Do yourself a favor.  Don't wait for this other girl any longer.  Start dating other girls but don't do it to make this girl jealous ~ do it for YOU.  You'll eventually find one out there that will quickly have you forgetting about this girl.  Trust me...<br>  Good luck to you!|`|42A0cw0Faa	Dude it sounds though she is trying not to hurt you by not wanting to being sly with you... respect her wishes and let her go...  Find someone else if she really really wanted you trust me the thought of you being with another girl will make her think twice|`|hHxJ0BONaa	if you she needs "space" shes not serious about your relationship and you should find someone more mature who can handle being with you all the time. some girls are not girlfriend/wife material and like to be sluts their whole lives.|`|kTB9PWRnaa	Yeah i think if you keep trying you will eventually get her! = ]|`|OyRX3OxLaa	as daniel k said...short story my ***!!|`|yrbSWaR1aa	maybe she only sees you two as friends. give her her space. wait...|`|vdmqdlNfaa	sigh... i only got "break 1", "2 years", "her Back", "harder" and "pressured",<br>  <br>  you said it was a short story so ya..|`|0ualEDtyaa	Awww I'm sorry you guys broke up =(<br>  <br>  But here's my advice: Try to forget about her, and try to move on, I know it's hard, I mean if she doesn't want u, then she's not worth it, just try to find someone who will love you, nd someone who will make you happy.<br>  Just forget about her and try to move on with your life, I hope I helped =)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|uNKX6Hrtaa	this is what i did to this guy that likes me alot.<br>  i think that maybe she might start liking you again but theres more of a chance with the more space you give her.<br>  so basically, i would tell you to yes, give her space. plenty of space.<br>  if she really still wants to be friends with you, she will text U every once in a while. instead of you making the effort all the time.<br>  also if she thinks that you dont like her as much, theres more of a chance that she will start liking you again<br>  <br>  hope i helped. even a little.<br>  <br>  u seem cool!!! lol.  =)

IPS3hWweaa	My opinion? People are free to do what they want.<br>  <br>  If he cheated then he deserves what he gets. But it still doesn't mean that the girlfriend will end up with the man if the wife finds out. Nothing is ever guaranteed.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	It is usually for revenge, the woman scorned mindset...and sometimes it is in hopes of wrecking the marriage so the gf can snag the husband. All are disastrous for all concerned.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	She has her own motive which is to validate herself.  In a marriage, the other women is the "odd man out".  She has to believe if there was no wife then she would be the wife.  Unfortunately, the role of the wife is not the problem.  She is trying to get a cheater as a partner and if she succeeds, she knows what she has coming.  The fidelity of an affair is broken before you even get to marriage.  There is a psychological lack in someone who accepts less before they even gets started and subconsciously she knows it.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	That's the risk a man takes when he is stupid enough to cheat on his wife....the jilted whore gets pizzed off and that's when the phone calls to your house start.......|`|AnW3dzQfaa	I can't believe that you hang out with friends like that.  Find some friends with high self-esteem and who want a man to respect them.|`|DapNp1Kxaa	No.That's it, just No.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	The girlfriends are selfish and beastly and rejected most of the time so they think that by telling the wife they are hurting the husband but in all actuality they are hurting the wife and children much more than the cheating dirt bag husband. Not to mention the extended family the in laws that have to except whatever path the person that was cheated on decides to take. If they decide to stick it out and work on saving the marriage they have to look this cheater in the face and have him in their holiday family pictures. If she leaves him they are loosing part of their family too. Its a really selfish thing to do. When someone tells the wife.|`|claUGpVRaa	Yes, when 'the other woman' tells the wife it is for revenge and it is pathetic! But then 'the other woman' IS pathetic (as is the cheating husband and he does deserve everything he gets too)<br>  <br>  If affairs ever become a formal relationship then both parties deserve everything they get. They have both been cheaters in the past and deserve for they're 'partner' to cheat on them. When it happens I have no sympathy for their pain when they have so easily inflicted it on others in the past. <br>  <br>  Sorry, but cheats make my skin crawl and my blood boil !!!<br>  Why does your friend not just break up with this guy? Why tell his wife putting her through the pain and agony it will cause. How would she like it? Tell her to just split up with him and then change her number and refuse to take calls from him/see him and be more choosy who she gets involved with next time. She should look for a man who isn't already spoken for, or she has the morals of a farmyard animal too.|`|WU6pTTvCaa	The only reason a 'girlfriend' would confront a wife is if she IS trying to breakup the marriage.  She may have been lead to believe he was on the way out, but she's not happy being second best any longer and sees that he has no intention of leaving his wife . . . but if his wife knew about her, then maybe SHE would leave.  Yes, it is playing dirty, but at least the girlfriend has the knowledge that this guy is not faithful going into 'their' relationship.|`|AA11603468	Yes, sometimes affairs do workout, and the "other woman" gets the man, but what kind of prize is that? A man who would betray his own family? Not much of a prize if you ask me.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	My cousin married her affair (after he broke up and got divorced).  They have been married for years (unhappily though).  She always wonders if he is having an affair on her now.|`|J6JFiNL8aa	no.....the "girlfriend" is a side whore homewrecker whom the man makes promises to that he never keeps|`|RYcvz94oaa	no omg..........|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	That is in God's hands...if the affair works or not. I think she needs to put her ego in check. <br>  <br>  It is his heart and soul :(  when the pain of concealing his affair gets great enough, if it ever does, he will have to come clean. I do not mean this sarcastically, I love a married man, and it kills me inside every day to know he is carrying all this 'toxic' stuff around..I am powerless over that!!!! My heart breaks with the thought of him being deceitful. I am a deeply spiritual woman and I know his heart/soul is suffering. This is not my lesson to learn, so I step aside. He has to learn what it is God is trying to teach him. If I step in my married bf will continue to manifest the same situations, and how is good for him? His soul needs to grow, and if I can help him do that I will...maybe I am just a conduit here in this situation, and he for me? and maybe I am doing exactly what I am supposed to be doing and learning my own lessons huh? I can handle being the other woman in his life for now, as I have made peace with my soul. How is really not your concern..just believe me, I sleep well with all the Love in my heart for this man.|`|YUkzmz1daa	Sometimes women tell the wife in hopes that the marriage will break up, other times it is to punish the man. The consequences are usually bad. (Divorce, heartbreak, etc.) I have known a couple of people who have done this. Most of them had kids. After the kids find out its very hard to recover from this without the kids hating the cheater for breaking up the family. If your thinking about having an affair, just leave your wife before you do, because she will always find out eventually and no matter what your relationship most likely won't work out.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Yes they can work.  My sister got a letter from the OW saying how good it felt when they were in bed together.  She kicked her husband out.  He went on to marry the OW and had a child with her.<br>  <br>  I am giving you and example of one case where this worked.  It was wrong to do what she did.  She has to live with that the rest of her life.  The odds are not in your girlfriends favor and I think it is just awful what she wants to do.  Try to convince her how wrong it is to do what she contemplates.  She is going to have to live with that guilt - and for what a month, two months of pleasure.  At best a couple years of marriage that wont be full filling in the end.  She needs to cut this man loose and find a single guy.  Its really the only true way to be happy.|`|cJSxv5n3aa	They do work out, they are just never the ones you hear about.<br>  <br>  If two people are open and honest about what they want, and do not pursue anything further than casual sex and perhaps some "dates" to enjoy each others company, it can work very well.<br>  <br>  It's usually the ones that resort to hiding the fact they are married, or try to downplay it as an unhappy marriage that find themselves in this situation, and the woman generally thinks they are doing them a favor by ending an unhappy relationship.|`|OEXHkNLTaa	No they don't. The "other woman" will want to talk to the wife either to for revenge (to her lover), or because she suddenly feels like everyone needs to know the truth about everything, and she can't keep her mouth shut any longer. No one wants the stress/trauma of a breakup, but I have a lover and now I wish I could hurt him like he has hurt me...so I was considering being a secret bearer of news to his wife. I won't do it because I 'm afraid to get implicated, as I'm married too. It's a drama and  perhaps could be the reason why the girfriend decides to reveal herself...the affair starts becoming boring and she wants to "spice things up" .Sick.<br>  <br>  Can you help ME?<br>  ..<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304082741AAMonAr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	never had one, but a friend did, and it was all about the physical part, and if she had spent more time trying to fix her marriage instead of having relations with some other guy, her marriage would have been saved.  Affairs of the heart, physical affairs, none of them work out, concentrate on the here and now, not the past, not the what ifs...., concentrate on whats right there in front of you|`|AA10353286	I would say all of the above. Dishonesty sux. Affairs hardly ever work out. Sometimes they do. A family member of mine left his wife of 25 years for some woman he met and fell in love with. They were married a year later, and that was almost 10 years ago.|`|gLH0gcXtaa	Don't ever put yourself second best to any man/woman. Treat yourself like the queen/king that you are.<br>  <br>  You deserve the very best. Affairs are for people who have no alternative or who don't want REAL, LASTING relationships.|`|AA10626566	Sure they work out - once they get the cheater then in time they do the same thing to them. She /he were cheating when they met and they will be cheating when they split.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	The man will be mad at her for doing that and she will be dumped. He might try to save his marriage or move on to someone else. That's my opinion.|`|LbJqU82waa	NEVER HAVE AND NEVER WILL|`|beGgFU7saa	Okay i beg to differ with a lot of people on this issue. First of all, the person that is doing the cheating is deceiving both parties involved and no one knows what he is telling to the other person that he is seeing. That does not make her a whore it just makes naive to the entire situation. Now once you become emotionally involved it is so hard to tell someone to walk away from a relationship, no matter what the circumstances maybe. And also you have some wives that will harass the other woman long after she has decided to leave the man alone. the problem lies with the other person. They knew that they were married long before the person that you are cheating with knew, so why be mad with them. <br>  Next the reason that she wants to contact the wife is strictly out of anger, he has told her so many confusing lies that she just wants clarity, and a little is just to hurt him as well, because believe me she is hurting whether she admits it or not. I suggest that she not do it, but instead get the strength to walk away it may take her a while, but she can do it
Nj4Dbce0aa	yeah go for it|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Yes you should ask him out.|`|HAgd5asNaa	wait a week or two because it feels weird to the guy when the girl asks him out... but after that do it.|`|3eEfdiReaa	no!!! wait for him definitely. and i hate it when ppl are too chicken to ask someone out so that they use a messenger. freaking stupid.|`|jxseTHg7aa	heck yes obviously he likes but is to nervous or frightened to come tell it to your face plus if you ask him out you will take the pressure of him|`|x7FjDcjzaa	tell him to f off and leave you the hell alone|`|KSGfrlffaa	umm girls shouldnt ask the guy out. it just is assertive and weird. wait for him to make a mmove and be flirty|`|iOpzTvSpaa	if you want this to turn into something then yes, you'll have to wear the pants to begin with, Hunter is having some ego problems and is worried that you might say no even though it's pretty obvious you want and he is embarrassed that everyone knows about it too so yeah, you'll have to do this but do it while the two of you are alone because it seems he doesn't like public relationships|`|fOEIODCdaa	well if he said that hes thinking about it then u should wait. in my view, the girl shouldn't ask the guy out (but that's just me). no offense, but if u ask him out after u texted him asking if he asked u out, then u might seem to desperate. unless he's really shy, u should wait.|`|sdiCDG5daa	I think it depends on how much you like him and also if you think it will work out. If you like him alot and you think it would work out than<br>  I think you should ask him out cuz you never  know if someone else askes first.|`|frBJEpSnaa	if he likes you and everyone is saying that he will ask you out then hes gonna ask you out. I think you can be patient...good luck. =D|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Okay, just go for it, if it turns you down big time, and I do mean big time, then you know.  Otherwise you will never find out and just leave him alone.|`|P3OWfxi5aa	JUST ASK HIM...what ya waitin for lol<br>  do it|`|cggkcAC5aa	let him know that you like him. One night you can say something like, "I want to tell you something, but there's a possibility it might make things weird between us. Can I tell you?" If he says yes, then say, "I really like you as a friend, but I've really started to like you as more than a friend. I'm not expecting a response because I know it might make you feel awkward, especially if you don't feel the same way. I also don't want to put you on the spot because I don't want to ruin our friendship. But I just wanted you to know in case you do feel the same way" This always works for me, i hope it works for you too =]|`|e0zVbslqaa	if you like him and he likes you, what do you have to loose ?<br>  hes most likely going to say yes.<br>  goodluck!|`|6Qs1VnSfaa	I think you should go for it, if your to scared to ask him out, just keep talking to him and be flirty, give him hints.|`|I1RD1a3kaa	ASK HIM OUT!!|`|itLS5Ualaa	ok it seams like people are playing around with you. tell him no if he does and threaten to cut nuts off if people bother you. if there to strong you know who to call. GHOSTBUSTERS|`|MXgqhx70aa	Holy crap...|`|35AfY6gTaa	just wait.  i think he will.   be patient, because guys think very slowly lol.
