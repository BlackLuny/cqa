I3PdIX0Kaa	I am so sorry you are going through this.  If it helps, I am 48 and just lost my father - and I know exactly how you feel.  Everyone grieves over the loss of someone they love.<br>  <br>  You are going through tough times right now - she is ill, you feel bad for her, and you feel sad that she might die soon.  When she does die, you will probably be confused - because you will be sad, but also relieved that she is no longer suffering.  It is a very confusing feeling!!  But it is normal.<br>  <br>  There are stages of grief - and everyone goes through them.  Each stage lasts as long as it needs to last in order for you to move forward in your grief.<br>  <br>  You will first be in denial... "No, this can't happen.  I can't handle this..."   You may even laugh and talk as if nothing is wrong.... and that is completely normal.<br>  <br>  Then there will come anger... "Why?  Why did this happen?"  You will lash out at everyone.  When someone tries to hug you, you'll probably push them away.  You'll feel mad all the time.  You may even feel mad at your grandmother for dying.  It is okay - this is normal too!<br>  <br>  After that there is some bargaining... "If only we had done this.." or "I promise to be good if you'll only bring her back..."  or "I wish I had done or said this...."  We try to take the blame for their death or illness and try to make "deals" with God or family or the dying person just to keep them around longer.<br>  <br>  Then there comes grief - overwhelming grief.  Crying, tears, sadness, depression.... my experience has taught me it is important to allow your body to cry.  Find a quiet place (I spent hours in my bathtub the days after my father died) and just let the tears flow.  It is okay to cry.<br>  <br>  There will come a point where your tears stop... and you have reached the last part of the grieving process..<br>  <br>  Acceptance - You know the person is gone - you know you miss them - and you have decided to accept this and honor their memory by living a good life.<br>  <br>  And that brings me to my last words...honey, live a life your Memere would be proud of.  You will ALWAYS have her memories.  Write down things and stories about her now while you remember them.. find pictures... take pictures... visit her... she will know you are there and it will make you happy to know you got to tell her you loved her in her last days.<br>  <br>  But from this point forward - live your life as though you are going to tell your Memere everything you do... do things she would be proud of or things that will make her laugh or smile.  Even after she is gone, live in honor of her.... make her proud of you!!!|`|F9D7OZejaa	What your going through is perfectly normal and I would suggest that you find something to help you cope with it. I'm personally atheist but if you are part of a religion you can talk to your spiritual elders or you can just talk to your parents about it. I would recommend you not kill yourself, especially when your so young, you got a lot of things to experience and live for.|`|4FS1wxi2aa	If you can't change something, you must learn to accept it, no matter how sad it may sound.<br>  <br>  Things in life will happen and some of them you can't do anything about it. Don't cry over it, just make her happy in her last moments and enjoy every second left.|`|2292675077dae921390116e7862cc989aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070918115009AACWowl">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  **************************************...<br>  perhaps the diagnosis is incorrect.<br>  <br>  see my comments please|`|1738296cc77006ee52364e11a2b2b669aa	The hardest thing to do is accept that a love one is/or has passed.  I just tried to remember the good time and memories you had with that person, sometimes it's hard because you don't feel like you got to spend enough time with them.  I lost my mother seven days before Christmas and I was on my way home to spend Christmas with her. 'My advice to you is to tell that person you love them as much as possible with the time you have left with them.  Just remember that they are going to a better place, and they will be free of pain and suffering.|`|b7jq1tfRaa	anybody who gives you cheap and easy advise is a fool.  There is no way to tell another person how to deal with death.  When my Mum passed away my brother and sister had a lot of problems, me a lot of people thought I was a callous ba$tard because I didn't show much emotion at the time.  My partner on the other hand she knew I was hurting really bad but someone had to solider on.<br>  <br>  I think only advise is to follow my Irish heritage, celibate your Memere's life and remember all of the good times.  I try to remember my Mum & my aunt who passed away not to long ago as they were when I was growing up not as the sick old ladies that they were when they passed on.<br>  <br>  Lastly if you will permit me, my prayers  go out to yourself and your family.
XIbct4fuaa	Being comfortable in your own skin.  Making mature decisions and living a responsible life.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I think age is a big factor for me, I find myself having more respect for men over 40. (no ive never dated anyone over 40) I just feel like by this age most men have their sh*t together, and if they don't well then not too many people from either gender have much respect for them.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Actually, I take guys less seriously when they worry about coming off as "manly."|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	-A guy with his own mind and opinion<br>  -A guy with an informed opinion<br>  -A guy that knows what he wants out of life and has a plan for getting those things<br>  <br>  All the other things are trivial.

H8MGismEaa	I think they get too much snow.|`|AleT38EYaa	I just moved here and I love it!  For a city of its size, it has a great amount of diversity.  Public transportation is easy to take, and the lakes area is a beautiful way to enjoy the outdoors.  <br>  <br>  For people who knock the cold, try living somewhere cold that has twice as many cloudy days as Mpls does and is still as cold.  That's where I moved from, one of the top 5 most depressing cities in the US.  <br>  <br>  I have been very happy with the quality of life I've found here in Minneapolis.  I can't see myself moving anytime soon!|`|n95AR8CYaa	On the negative side: Worst climate on the whole planet.  Minus 20F in the winter and 90F with 90% humidity in the Summer.  Mosquitoes the size of robins. Football team always chokes in the playoffs. On the plus side: Nice people lots of outdoor activities (whenever the weather isn't sucking).
0bYcYz2jaa	Who doesn't like a little mystery?  I would think that seeing someone who had the decency, integrity and class to cover up would be more attractive than someone who had everything on show, out in the open.  My mom always told me to choose what I want to show and cover everything else.  It makes sense to me, you want to move the focus to what you think your best attribute is, not just show it all and hope they notice your eyes!  If I show my back, legs, cleavage, arms, tummy and face, what do you think will get the attention?  Certainly not my nice smile.  Besides, my husband likes that he and only he gets to have it all even if I show a little leg or cleavage.|`|oTqZm4NFaa	Definitely|`|vQTYDR1oaa	Yes, in the eyes of my bf. Sometimes when one tries too hard to capture attention by revealing lots of flesh, it just makes those who dress modestly look more appealing & of course vice-versa. Decent people tend to favour a decent and modest dressing of their ideals and dislike revealing dressing.|`|61AjTvw7aa	If it can't be then I'm not sexy in the least bit<br>  <br>  But..

Do not take hasty decision. Jobs are hard to come by in these days of recession.|`|oTwymgpIaa	I wouldn't say anything. I'd just leave because you probably won't accomplish anything positive by speaking your mind. If I did say something, I'd say something like this, I know things have been trying at times, but I appreciate all the help and support I have received during this past year, or something to that affect. If your bosses and colleagues don't like you, every minute you remain with that company damages your work reputation and your self-esteem. It is best to just find another job because you aren't going to change their opinion of you. ;-)|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	Make a thorough introspection of your motives, behaviour in relation to your company and its employees, if there is any room for change  and if it is needed, change yourself to the situation.

Like said, it's just for advertisement, simply ignore it. :]
K4zsztkRaa	Well when it comes to child support that's a whole other thing.<br>  <br>  Child support can be extreemly unfair and it's almost like robbing the man. I feel bad for my dad a little bit cause he was to pay but honestly idk.<br>  <br>  My dad cares more about me than money, but honestly he cares about money too. I mea his money is his future. If he doesn't have any then he can't take care of me.<br>  <br>  It goes hand in hand. Men want money so they can provide for their families. That's why we worry about it so much. We feel like as a man it's our job to get the money and we want to give our families everything their hearts desire.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|oO4TUkVkaa	It is so unfair to lump all men into the same group on this.  I know a lot of men that would kill for their kids and money is so far down the list compaired to their kids.  Yeah there are some men that care more about money but you can't say all men  only care about money.  My husband would do anything for his kids and money falls to the bottom of the list.|`|AaoLwJJWaa	well it depends on the situation, the plans of the man and finally he man himself.  Most guys would take care of thier kids, however, if the child was strongly unwanted, then they would not care for it much. personally, it wouldn't matter how unwanted the child was for me, i would still raise him/her with all the same love my own parents did me.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it's part of a cycle: if a guy's dad didn't want him and was never around or important to him, he could grow up thinking it shouldn't matter for him as well....and so on and so forth|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I would think that 'most' men would care more about their children.<br>  Besides there are more non-custodial mothers that don't pay support, than there are non-custodial fathers who don't.<br>  Should the question not also pertain to mothers?|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Most men care more about their kids.  Some do care about their money more I suppose.  However, when you've been kept from seeing your own kid for over a year, as a few guys I've met have been, and the courts will not only not help you out but sometimes will actually help the other parent out instead, wouldn't you kind of get irritated about it after a while?  I'm not saying it's right to cut off money to your own child, but I can sort of guess at what they're feeling in those cases and see why they might see it as pointless to pay child support.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but the mere fact you asked this makes most of us think you have serious doubts about fathers as parents.  I don't doubt if I asked this about women I'd have a hell of a fight on my hands from people on here right now.  Nobody even questions that thought because it would be wrong.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	It depends on the man. Some men think that being a father means sending a check, while other fathers actually care about their child's well-being.<br>  <br>  And, in all fairness, many mothers don't even allow the men in their lives to see the children often, resulting in a rift in the family.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	It takes a special kind of sexist cretin to even think that a father would care about money more than his child/ren.<br>  <br>  But, then, this is GWS - feminist homeland... so what else could I expect to hear but blatant sexist attitudes towards men.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	Many men who care about their children and their money would rather have custody as to eliminate the necessity to make a decision of this sort.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Children, but every now and then, his live in girlfriend gets pissed that she's not getting the money over his children.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Yah its like saying if you do not want to work because you are being forced to you are lazy.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Same question can be asked of women....and the answer is the same. <br>  Depends upon the man/woman.|`|2cb0f6f1f1f1953cc7ec1e35a15abb21aa	Well my husband is a stay at home Dad. So in my opinion, the children|`|cEANjNHXaa	Well my dad doesn't give a **** about me<br>  <br>  so im gonna say money cuz he's selfish and doesn't pay child support|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	Id say money, cause some of the men who complain do not really pursue their rights to see their children, they give up on them and talk shiz on their ex's.|`|YQOT68xFaa	That depends on the man! There are some guys who love their kids more than anything and care far more about the kids than the money. But there are some men who care more about the money. You can't define all men as one or the other because all men are different.<br>  <br>  "I only asked about fathers because a lot of the male GWS members ask many questions pertaining to supporting a child for 18 years and being deceived by women."<br>  <br>  That's probably because 1) it sucks being lied to about a child that you thought was your own, because then you know she has betrayed you; 2) most fathers would rather be there with their child 24/7 instead of having only visitation rights and being stuck with nothing but a financial contribution to their kid's life; and 3) the family court system is skewed hugely in favour of women - they call all the shots and men get screwed over time and again.

XIbct4fuaa	I always liked social studies except for when the football coach was my teacher.  Which was actually in the 8th and 9th grade.  Its an easy A and an easy class to teach, thats why the had the dumb jocks teach it.

vRodocjcaa	Is it? I wouldn't imagine it would be. But I guess if you're not willing to take "grandma" type part-time jobs, that can slim things down. I suppose hard-core competitive companies may have an impression that older people wouldn't be as competent or as good of a long term investment if specialized job training is involved. If that is so, I am sorry.|`|Ag5FNHa1aa	Is it really? hmm well the only explination i can think of is this dang society! They just want the fast pace hard working young good looking men who are going to really cash in! No offence, they totally underestimate older people. Im so sorry its like this.|`|SIYyTfl5aa	Usually employers are usually looking for someone young and energetic.  Another reason is they want someone that has a lower chance of dying and by doing so forcing them to hastily fill an empty slot.|`|eRQ5MX2aaa	No one likes old people.<br>  They are slow.<br>  Higher change to getting injured
Ki7DSLX6aa	It can be very hard but while you are having the confrontation think about what you are about to say or do before you do anything and take a deep breath and walk away. It will take time but just keep your mind set on how you want a better outcome.|`|eRQ5MX2aaa	Cut yourself.|`|Ag5FNHa1aa	My trick to being angry is not to stay silent, but to whisper. <br>  Take as a senario, while my boyfriend and i are screaming at eachother and ready to slit eachothers throats, i wisper what i want to say so he has to stop and say "what?" and then i whisper so he has to listen. And i never really have to yell but im not just avoiding my problem like a baby. <br>  See the problem with scilence anger is you never get your point across. It just lingers and nothing is ever settled until someone speaks and by then the conflict is through.<br>  Whisper, you would be surprised that such a faint nosie can say so much.
1KnDF5Pcaa	I'd be wary in saying that your behavior as a baby could be called Social Phobia. Mainly because the reactions you were giving occurred in a situation that wouldn't be considered truly social.  Also, disorders that stem from a conscious fear that something will happen usually don't manifest in children that young, simply because they have not developed the cognitive skills to comprehend that.<br>  <br>  I'd say that your actions as a baby were mainly behavioral and learned, as that is the only process a baby is capable of that young. You falling out of the high chair - I won't presume I'm an expert at this, but I don't think it would create such a strong connection, because, again, your mind hadn't developed enough to make a connection that complicated. It would be understandable if you refused to sit in the high chair after that, and even if it got generalized to all high places, but I don't think you would have been able to make the connection of your mother being at fault there.<br>  <br>  My only idea as to what it could be is simply a personality difference.  It's known that while babies are usually the same throughout, there is usually personality differences that are inherent in the baby. I don't know where they come from, but I do know they are there.  It is often a main reason for stress in some cases of raising the child, and is shown how some mothers love playing with their baby all the time, and others aren't happy with the fact that the baby is so energetic and active all the time. It can be the other way around. The mother can be happy that a certain baby is quiet, or can be discouraged when they wish to play with the baby, and the baby cries from being startled.  <br>  <br>  The latter case could very well be your case. However, I won't make assumptions concerning your life. However, I would not dwell too much on it, because even though it is the developmental stage of life, does not mean it decides how you will be the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  (Also, be careful with the Meyers-Briggs test. While it's nice to have a category you can associate with in terms of personality, it's not very practical, for while you might match some qualities of a group, you could be completely the opposite of other qualities. Personalities are much to specialized to be able to be broke into so few groups.<br>  <br>  Also, watch out for the barnum effect. This is simply the process of making such broad claims that it could fit anybody who hears it, and is often seen in use by mystics, horoscopes, etc.)|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	Interesting question.<br>  Usually, I would think, mistreatment by someone, say if the baby were hurt, would cause the baby to be leery of being held.<br>  Let me comment generally on all that you said.

ZsxbOXtzaa	My daughters used to tell me,when I chided them for not doing their best, "but daddy,I'm just a little girl". I told them that was just an excuse. They grew up to be contributing members fo society, and grand kids are following their leads. Some excel in male dominated fields.Hell yes they should be paid the same, but first they have to do the same job. My kids say they have to do it better. And then proceed to do so!!!|`|84gK4XlHaa	Depends on what that same job is.  If it's an entry-level position, then yes.  Otherwise, I don't think that it's unreasonable for level of education, years of experience, etc. to come into play.  The point is that gender shouldn't be a consideration.  But the problem with that is when you try and analyze that from a sociological perspective and ask why men and women are stronger in different areas and what kind of cultural changes need to be made to even the playing field.  It's never as simple as "everyone should be paid equally"|`|vEj7xoBraa	What same job? men go up a building when they are building houses,men go up high in the electric wires,men go into burning houses to rescue people,men do dangerous stunts in movies.<br>  <br>  Women babysit,women clean houses,women work as receptionists,non of women's jobs are dangerous.

People need to get a grip on this ; I've studied this hypothesis & reached the same conclusions as dozens of studies have proven over time.. 1st, I presume "the same job" to infer accomplishing the same results & requirements with similar efficacy as per the job description. Generally speaking & due to their "issues", I've found that females become distracted easier, have to talk more, have to go to the bathroom, get something to drink, etc....

I get you when you say its hard making friends, I mean to some people they find it so easy, like they don't even try, they just seem to make friends so easily. But, that doesn't go for all people buddy. I think if the situation is REALLY bugging you and causing you a lot of stress & problems, then you should seek professional help with this. There's therapy, counseling, or you can talk to whoever you trust and feel comfortable with. I know it may seem like people who take therapy are "crazy" or what not, but its really a good thing to go to a professional and share your feelings and emotions with them, as they will show you ways to cope and deal with your problems. Don't give up buddy! Stay strong and keep in mind that this will come to pass!

Even take a friend with you and make it a regular thing, start at your own pace and in time you will find you will have picked up speed compared to when you started.<br>  It will become easier from then on, but you have to want the change for your self.<br>  Start with the regular walking and slowly work your way to what ever healthy activity's your interested in.<br>  <br>  Good luck and peace    :)

The world is now a lot more diverse now than ever before thanks to industrialisation and globalisation. I think the UK has an identity crisis. I think people need to realise that the UK is a great place that has welcomed oppressed people from around the world due to wars that we have taken part in.

DM2M5LK4aa	In the perspective of the confident person, what exactly is the difference?  The answer is both.  Whether you actually "know" something or just "think" you know something affects the actual outcome of a given situation.  The fact is this: in the confident persons mind, there is no difference between what he "knows" and what he "believes" he knows.  He knows something and, depending on whether he was right or not, he either becomes more confident or is proved wrong and loses that confidence; therefore, confidence can arise from either of these.|`|PPwsaeUxaa	Both. You can convince yourself of something that you don't really know and that can lend you confidence.

I see more men objectifying women, in the form of reducing them to a body then women reducing men to a wallet, and on a rare occasion, men who will reduce a woman to a wallet, and women who will reduce a man to a body.  I think that the frequencies of these forms of objectification purely a remnant of ancient culture, and has nothing to with the nature of men or women.  On an individual basis, if we ignore one being more prevalent that the other, I would say that reducing a person to a body is worse then reducing them to a wallet, simply because a body can't take care of itself; the wallet is quite necessary.  A person (male of female) who is reduced to a wallet can leave the objectifier, and since they have had the money all along, all they will have done will be to have liberated themselves from a parasite, sapping off their pay check.  A person who has been reduced to a body will be discouraged from taking care of them self, or acting independently, and thus, if they leave their objectifier, they will be without a way support them self, socially of financially.  Simply put, a person reduced to a body can be held captive more esily than one reduced to a wallet.

Nobody that has not experienced this situation in real life can understand the true gravity of the situation.  I have witnessed first hand the pain and suffering cancer causes in a human being.  I have seen the sleepless nights, the non-stop vomiting, the deterioration of the human body due to the fact that it will no longer accept any nutrients; only vomit them out.  I have experienced all of this.  I can tell you one thing, if this person had asked me to help him end his misery.. to provide him with eternal peace and tranquility and end his constant suffering, I would have.  It would have been the hardest thing imaginable to do, but I would have.  <br>  <br>  I can also tell you that there is a point in any situation where a person no longer wishes to keep pursuing his/her treatment.  There becomes a time when the chemo kills the body more than the cancer does, and the treatment becomes more tiring and harmful to the body than the actual disease does itself.  Having been in this exact situation myself, take my word for it.

It is learned and passed from the older generations to the newer ones. For an effective transfer of culture from one generation to another, it has to be translated into symbols. Language, art and religion serve as the symbolic means of transfer of cultural values between generations.<br>  <br>  Culture is a bond that ties the people of a region or community together. It is that one common bond, which brings the people of a community together. The customs and traditions that the people of a community follow, the festivals they celebrate, the kind of clothing they wear, the food they eat, and most importantly, the cultural values they adhere to, bind them together.<br>  <br>  why does any of this culture stuff matter?<br>  <br>  Culture is the primary influence on who we are as people. Many Catholics reading this will rise up in arms and demand to know how I can say this. Isn’t faith a more important influence? The answer, of course, is yes—considered in itself. But how is faith passed to a person? Almost entirely through culture.<br>  <br>  If it is cultural to go Mass every day, to use pious saying like “Offer it up” and “Deo volente,” to always say grace before meals and pray the rosary every day, to treat the opposite sex (other than spouses, of course) with the appropriate detachment, then naturally that person will imbibe from his culture a great deal of his faith, and will learn about his faith more or less entirely from its embedding in his culture. If, on the other hand, it’s cultural to go to Mass occasionally, maybe a couple times a month at most; to know what a rosary is but not how to pray it (if that), to get your children baptized and maybe confirmed but never anything more than that, to be constantly and overly familiarly in the presence of those of the opposite sex, and to use statements like “G** d*** it” and “F*** it” rather than “offer it up” and “Deo volente,” one will imbibe little of the faith; and will, in fact, only acquire the faith by acting counterculturally.<br>  <br>  In such cases, of course, one is obliged to act counterculturally, and thus attempt to improve one’s culture by one’s interaction with it. But the fact remains that men interact with one another, and learn their highest ideals, mostly from their interactions with those around them; and those around them will be overwhelmingly (in most cases) of the same culture. If 95% of the people around him are good, practicing Catholics trying hard to become saints, they are much more likely to be the same than someone who’s surrounded by modernist neo-pagans who wouldn’t know the truth if it walked up and hit them in the face. This is simply a fact of life; we are enormously influenced by the practices and habits of those around us. The goodness or badness of those habits (most of which fall under the ambit of “culture”) will thus be a large part of forming the goodness or badness of our own habits, and thus our virtue, and thus our salvation.<br>  Culture is seen as a system of social control, wherein people shape their standards and behavior. The cultural values form the founding principles of one’s life. They influence one’s principles and philosophies of life. They influence one’s way of living and thus impact social life.<br>  <br>  The importance of culture lies in the fact that it is a link between people and their value systems.

t2R3mEMoaa	No. Personally I love the diversity because I am able to learn about all kinds of cultures, religions and social norms and never leave my homeland. It's great! Belonging is in the mind and heart of each of us, not walking down a street. As Stevy Wonder once said, "people are the same wherever you go"! and I believe it in many ways.

It requires being inwardly honest, accepting how you feel, and have the courage to express this.<br>  <br>  We live in a society that places so much importance upon appearances that many people begin to "role play" in their lives, to try to live according to some persona or image.<br>  <br>  The problem with this is that life becomes artificial and we don't experience reality.  I think it also can be very draining upon us, as we aren't acting upon our true desires.<br>  <br>  If you want to change then start asking yourself what you really want out of life.

I find it's easy to tell him even what he wants to hear so that I can just not have to go. <br>    The one thing that he keeps telling me is that I should not let the past affect the future, or how others define me be my guide. I am tired of both those sentences so I agree with him so we can move it along.|`|g7FsVQhUaa	Some people believe that you can change your life by changing your attitude.  Here is a quote that expresses that view:<br>  <br>  "Could we but change our attitude, we should not only see life differently, but life itself would come to be different. Life would undergo a change of appearance because we ourselves had undergone a change in attitude."  Katherine Mansfield<br>  <br>  That is the theory. Even the writer started the quote with the word "could."  If or how you apply this theory is a very individual thing.
NBy23FHXaa	The term "hyperinflation" refers to a very rapid, very large increase in the price level. Measurement problems will be too minor to notice on this scale. There is no strict formal definition for the term, but cases of hyperinflation tend to be expressed in terms of multiples rather than percentages. "For example, in Germany between January 1922 and November 1923 (less than two years!) the average price level increased by a factor of about 20 billion." Some representative examples of hyperinflation include<br>  <br>  "Hyperinflation <br>  1922 Germany 5,000% <br>  1985 Bolivia >10,000% <br>  1989 Argentina 3,100% <br>  1990 Peru 7,500% <br>  1993 Brazil 2,100% <br>  1993 Ukraine 5,000%"<br>  <br>  This is the way that hyperinflations happen: by a self-reinforcing vicious cycle of printing money, leading to inflation, leading to printing money, and so on. This is one reason why inflation is feared. There is always the concern that even a little inflation this year will lead to more next year, and so on.<br>  <br>  hyperinflation is a rapid increase in the general price of goods and services, brought about as a result of a rapidly expanding money supply.|`|4nA4sxPbaa	B=py-c(y)<br>  <br>  dB/dp=dpy/dp+dyp/dp-dc(y)/dp <br>  dB/dp=y+dy/dp y-dc(y)/dp<br>  dB/dp=y(1+dy/dp) - dc(y)/dp<br>  <br>  A severe decline in total output is defined as an aggregated effect <br>  dy/dp<0<br>  <br>  If we suppose dB/dp=0 <br>  <br>  dy/dp=dc(y)/ydp-y/y<0<br>  dy/dp=y dc(y)/dp - 1<0<br>  <br>  Then when output goes down due to hyperinflation <br>  y dc(y)/dp<1<br>  <br>  This expression if maths are correct and economy axioms well set up  means that production functions of the companies are influenced by a price rise and that effect multiplied by the output in the first period, before the quick inflation, must be below one. This result is only valid for competitive markets.<br>  <br>  We can modify the result and write it down in the following way<br>  dc(y)/dp<1/y<br>  <br>  Output reduced by stable and rising inflation simply means that costs structures are modified and when we observe the result we can say that the risk is bigger in developed countries and less dangerous in underdeveloped ones.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	Hyperinflation means that people are longer saving, without savings there can not be investment capital. Without investment capital no new business or factories can be started. So thus leading to a severe decline in total output.|`|M3pjhIecaa	Inflation increases the base costs from materials to production meaning goods go unsold, inventory builds, jobs are cut and so on the more severe the inflation they larger the problem will become. <br>  Take a look at Zimbabwe to see the end result more or less total collapse of the infrastructure of the society.
M3pjhIecaa	Is this your homework or something? <br>  You get paid 100usd's a day on your daily out goings on day one you pay out 95 usd's <br>  On day 2 you  get 110 usd's because you got a pay rise however your daily out goings have increased by 20 pct because your rail fair went up. so you out goings are now 114 usds and your in negativeterritoryy. <br>  <br>  Obviously a. is the best of both worlds asthere'ss full employment so a shortage of workers and inflation is running at 6 pct which means if they don't give you a pay rise significant enough to offset you go and work somewhere else. Its of course self generating as inflation will continue to increase as you demand more money. <br>  b. means you have to watch what you say if you want to keep your job your pay increases will be minimal becausethere'ss plenty out there to take your job. the idea of price stability in this situation is unlikely as stagflation is more likely to start setting in.

One of the girls that all the guys thought was hot showed up for the trip that morning with no makeup on.  The reaction was pathetic.  All the same boys who were constantly oogling her were laughing  in their little groups and talking about how she looked like she was sick.  So in answer, we feel the need because guys tell us that we need it.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	I agree with your "additional detail".  It's sad that women wear makeup for "confidence"!<br>  <br>  Saying it's a confidence booster still doesn't address WHY they feel the need to wear it.  Rather, they are assuming it's attractive, thus something to help them face the world.<br>  <br>  What they are missing is that the truly confident women won't need makeup to make her feel confident!  If a woman's confidence is increased by something like makeup, that means she's sorely LACKING in REAL confidence!<br>  <br>  Even if the confident woman would prefer the way she looks in the makeup, it's not going to make her artificially confident because she has the real thing.  A truly confident woman would be proud to face the world even without it!<br>  <br>  To address your concept of "why do they need it"; I have always found it fascinating.  I almost always find a beautiful woman a lot MORE beautiful with minimal or no makeup!  And on a woman who is not naturally beautiful, it doesn't make her beautiful as much as it makes her appear like she's TRYING too hard to be beautiful.<br>  <br>  It seems to stem to the same thing which makes women want to do all kinds of things which detract from their natural beauty.  Such as plucking eyebrows thinner, lightening their hair, straightening their hair, wearing spike heels, using botox and getting mammoth fake breasts.  All kinds of artificial alterations which only detract from the natural beauty they COULD have had.<br>  <br>  What's also ironic is the amount of time and money women spend doing all these things when spending half that much time in the weight room would improve them in more substantive ways.<br>  <br>  As a single man I find it frustrating how rare the truly confident woman - confident enough to be natural - is.|`|KI4NieoTaa	To alot of boys, looks are alot.<br>  To some it isnt.<br>  <br>  Makeup gives a girl confidence, and feel that it can hide what they dont like.<br>  Take me for example, i wear makeup, to cover up my freckles.<br>  YUCK.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	they wear it to hide what they believe are flaws, I find this very interesting because often its the little imperfections that I find most attractive.|`|Y3OeeB66aa	to decisive men make believe that they are healthy and a good mating choice|`|rfQlSYU7aa	"Why is it that women feel they need makeup to be beautiful, attractive, and have sex appeal?"<br>  <br>  Its called GROOMING.  Men also engage in grooming.  Men were really addicted to grooming a few hundred years ago: they would wear white pancake face powder, draw on ruby red lips and wear 3 foot high wigs.  Ancient Egyptians used henna and coal as make-up, BOTH GENDERS. You can add chimpanzees, pigeons and cats to your list: they and most animal species groom not only themselves but their mates and offspring.

You have no idea how much fun it can be, none. And, heck yeah, it can make us all look a heck of a lot more physically attractive, men and women. <br>  <br>  Chances are, really, if I'm wearing makeup I'm sick, though. Or overtired, possibly that and hungover. <br>  <br>  I'm wearing makeup, most often, to look like I'm alive, alert, awake, and enthusiastic. <br>  <br>  I can do that, though, I'm a girl. Boys just have to deal with looking like they have a flu while trying to convince people they don't.<br>  <br>  I love wearing makeup because, sometimes, I can do the smoky/sultry look. I can, just that night, be that person if I want to.<br>  <br>  Really, about 5 days out of thirty, on a good month (1 out of 30 on a bad) I'll wear makeup. I have the time and desire then. I'd wear it more because it is fun but the extra 10 to 20 minutes of sleep matter more. Or, even, just sitting around doing nothing.<br>  <br>  But you have no idea how lucky I am. I'm not naturally gorgeous, rather plain, actually, I just have that much of an ego. I am as hot as I am because of my personality. My makeup, or lack thereof, reflects that. <br>  <br>  Right now my eyebrows are the sort of bushy that only plucked-but-grown-back eyebrows can be. I like how they look plucked but won't pluck until I feel the desire to. They are a very dark brow. Most of my hair is light reddish orange. It's the colour I like best. My two inch roots are a light brown/dark blond. Whatever.<br>  <br>  I have three zits I wouldn't bother to hide even if I were wearing makeup. I get zits, I'm human, you do to. Why should we feel imperfect for them?<br>  <br>  Women who can't leave their houses without "putting their faces on" do so because women's beauty is such a major issue. <br>  <br>  The funniest thing is that because I use makeup for my own pleasure I'm in  very unique position. Sometimes I do a "fresh face." It's a light dusting of powder, a subtle blush, the tiniest hint of a very fleshy pink on my eyes, mascara, and my usual chapstick. It is a very natural look. Guys will point to me and say (and, actually, have),"Julie doesn't wear makeup and she looks fine," when the girls will laugh at them and point out exactly the makeup I am wearing.<br>  <br>  And I laugh along with.<br>  <br>  Most men, yes, do want the hottest woman they can get. And, yes, most of us are going to play to that by making ourselves hotter. So you don't like girls that wear makeup because it is false? You judge just as superficially. It's just makeup. <br>  <br>  I, frankly, have amazing breasts. I've never shied from a low-cut blouse. I like how they look. I do, if you don't, then fine, whatever, I like them. I found a pretty big lump in one and went through a week of hell with just the concern that it might be breast cancer. I was fully prepared for a double mastectomy realizing that I have no insurance and reconstruction might be well beyond my means. Fine, better no breasts than cancer.<br>  <br>  Now I have no cancer, a benign tumor. I'm only going to show them off more, now. Not because you might think they are hot but because they are mine, they aren't killing me, and I am not dying.<br>  <br>  I wear makeup when and if I like to. It's not all about you. I'm beautiful whether or not I'm still beautiful to you when I'm not showing you my imperfection. And my boobs rock because they exist, still, and so do I.<br>  <br>  Maybe if women could wear makeup without being judged for wearing it AND not be judged for not wearing it, (for better or worse, either way), it wouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  But, then again, what's your income? How much can you bench press? How cool is your car, and why? How hot is your wife? Which vanity are you subject to? Or are you just so perfect that you wear only sweats, sit around watching TV all day, and feel no need ever to do anything better with yourself for any reason? And what reasons do not involve pride?<br>  <br>  Do you not want to be attractive? Do you not want to have sex appeal if even only for your wife?<br>  <br>  We all need to balance the absurdities of human nature and personal needs and wants. <br>  <br>  And women are, most certainly, not the ones to be blamed for taking the time and effort to consider how others perceive them. Gosh! How dare we be so shallow!|`|AA10584077	It can be fun to put on, but I don't believe that it should be a crutch. A woman shouldn't get to the point where she feels she has to have it on her face at all times. If you spend some time learning some techniques, you can enhance what's naturally good looking about your features, and who doesn't want to amplify their good traits? Men do it, too, with nice suits, shoes, watches, that sort of thing... You can wiggle that around to be some form of deception or dishonesty if you want to, but I think that may be putting an unnecessarily negative spin on a natural human tendency to just want to play up your good qualities.<br>  <br>  I mean, MSG ain't exactly good for you, but I'll bet you $20 that you enjoy it when it's in your food.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Since you seem to be wondering about our own habits, I just want to say that I don't wear makeup. Well, maybe three or four times a year. It's just fun to put on sometimes. So, yeah, the act of putting it on is entirely based on my own wants and desires!|`|AA11610779	I pretty much never wear make-up because I think it's a waste of time! What's more, it takes a while to apply it properly, and a lot of girls don't know how to apply make-up (myself included!!!).<br>  <br>  Anyway, I guess I don't really need to (I know this doesn't sound humble at all - I'm not beautiful, but I'm just pretty, like a LOT of girls) but I also know that compared to girls who wear make up, I'm probably not as good-looking. What's more, men tend to like girls who wear make-up, or at least they look at them and flirt with them more. It might be because if you actually make the effort to put make-up on, men think that you're trying to please them. So that's also why I don't put make-up on! <br>  <br>  I like to put make-up on once in a while when I actually have a boyfriend. It's nice to feel more pretty, and it's nice that your bf actually notices it. But I wouldn't do it on a regular basis.|`|sYO70GJRaa	It's very nice that you do not put pressure on your wife to wear makeup :) <br>  Not all people are like you though, and it doesn't matte how beautiful and intelligent a woman may be, many guys think that there is going to be an even more beautiful woman just waiting around the corner. This makes females insecure.

Guys are completely okay with how a girl looks right when she wakes up.<br>  <br>  She wears make up because of what other girls think of her. Girls become self-conscious and girls can be total bitches to other girls. The more make up a girl wears, the less confident she is in herself.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this provided some insight.|`|E5eZn9rcaa	Hmmmm. In my case I do it because it shows my personality.

o96wvl3naa	If you are kissing a close friend, then it represents your respect and adoration for your friend. You are seeking some intimate closeness that is lacking in some waking relationship. It may or may not signify a romantic interest for him or her. <br>  <br>  personally i believe it is just your brain getting rid of information no longer needed <br>  So you could have seen someone kissing and remember a conversation with this friend as your brain gets rid of this information it merges together|`|9RC2EPANaa	you could of been lovers or had a crush on him in a past life???<br>  <br>  my book says "if the person whom you kiss is responsive, you will never bestow your affections on one only"

This is the beginning of alcoholism. Your friend didn't say it, the alcohol did. People say and do many things when they drink that they would never even conceive to say/do when they are sober. If you want more information to confirm this, just pick up some pamphlets on this horrendous disease. While I'm sure you are hurt by this, that was not your friend speaking, but how she may even feel about herself, and I am sure if she even remembers she said it, she feels terrible about it. Give her a call or better still go and have a talk with her. Maybe you can also help her realize she could be heading for a lifetime of this behaviour if she continues to drink or drug.|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	First, say by yourself, "I forgive you.

Forgiveness does not mean you have to resume socializing with her. I wouldn't.  Perhaps it means that if you had the chance to get even, based on your having forgiven her,, you would choose not to.<br>  You are who and what your are--what this other person called you doesn't change that.

When someone drunk, they might told the truth. Ask her then decide it after that whether you can forgive her or not. Girl's fight will never going smooth, what I knew is most of them won't forgive, but if you really a true friend, learn to forgive.|`|BehIVocqaa	Several of the most cruel and horrible things that have been said to me were spoken by someone who was drunk.  My ex mother-in-law hurt me horribly while she was drinking one night.  I had just had a miscarriage and was devastated & heart broken.  She said, "You know you cheated me out of my first grand child, don't you?"  It was like she punched a hole in my already battered & bruised self esteem/self worth.  I hold her responsible for what she said, and I will never forget it.  Our relationship was never the same after that.  It was never a matter of forgiveness.  It was about never letting my guard down around her again.  I believe personal relationships without basic trust (knowing that someone cares about you and won't purposely hurt you) are difficult to maintain and are just not worth the effort. <br>  To forgive or not?  It is up to you...what do you feel in your heart?|`|rOMTKmjDaa	Don't take it personally. She was drunk. Let her know how it made you feel and THEN make up your mind about her.

They perceive themselves as different from others, distinguished by unusual experiences, perspectives, and values.<br>  <br>  ·    A third false conclusion stemming from egocentrism is called the imaginary audience.  This arises from many adolescents' assumption that other people are as intensely interested in them as they themselves are.  This results in acute self-consciousness (Berger, 2000, p. 475).

0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	The advantage is that you can see recurrent themes.  It isn't a particular dream that has meaning but what keeps coming back to you.
6BzFgObWaa	First of all recording your dreams in a dream journal is fun.  k<br>  <br>  That said, it is a good way of not forgetting your dreams later on.  Of course you have to have your journal by your bed and it is best to record every detail you remember before you get out of bed or stir around much.<br>  <br>  If a dream has prophetic meaning or anything it will not be "polluted" with a lot of other "stuff"... Usually this type of dream is short, focused, and the main point of the dream is centralized.<br>  <br>  want an example?  Here is one... I dreamed a few years ago that I was walking in the woods, it was night, I was alone, I came upon a bed in the middle of the woods... on this bed was a man.  I didn't know who he was but I had the distinct feeling that he was related.  The man was dead.<br>  <br>  The dream was simple, a general setting (the woods)... a centralized character (me) and of course a main, overriding feeling (death)<br>  <br>  The next morning I received a call from my grandmother.  She told me that an uncle of mine had went hunting that night.  He was found in the woods later that day.  He had suffered a heart attack and died.<br>  <br>  If a dream is too "busy" crazy and chaotic with a lot of jumping from this scene to that and so forth, it is more than likely just something you ate, know what I mean?<br>  <br>  Anyway, back to your original question.  Hind sight is always better than foresight so keeping a record of your dreams is very helpful in <br>  <br>  (a)  Remembering the dream<br>  (b)  Deciphering the dream<br>  (c)  Understanding the dream<br>  (d)  Just for the plain fun of reading it later.|`|DLCfiJwCaa	I believe that dreams give you an idea of what your unconscious thinks about. The conscious is the part of the mind that you think in. The unconscious does whatever it pleases. You have no say about happens in there. It causes Freudian Slips, deep psychological issues, and dreams/nightmares. Looking back at past dreams can give you an idea of what your unconscious is brooding about while you go through your conscious life.

NAGiNKFWaa	I have worked for many crooked employers who thought you had to break the law for them in order to keep your job.  I have had the luxury of quitting bad jobs because I didn't have kids to support.  I would hate to think what crimes I would have had to commit in order to keep a job to support a child.  Sometimes the reason to not have kids is to protect them from bad relatives.  I have a bad family, and my husband has a bad family, so to stop the abuse, it is best not to have kids.  Many people choose not to have kids to stop the cycle of abuse.|`|osaGXG6Paa	gotten stoned and while watching Wall-E

AA10835554	You said it exactly, it is when you get excited. If you're new to lucid dreaming, meaning you haven't had 100 LD's yet, then its very hard to stay calm, because its just so mind blowing. Try to remember the next time you find yourself in a dream, to stay very calm. This doesn't mean you can't run around, fly or anything like this, but try to do it in a very relaxed way. Sexual activity can be very quick to wake you up.<br>  <br>  Also when you start to see everything get dim, blurry or just turning black on you, remember to close your dream eyes, hold out your arms and start to spin. While you spin say to yourself, the next thing I see will be a dream, or state where you want to go. You may lose your dream body and be floating in darkness for a moment, but wait and everything will come back to you, clear and bright. You'll probably be in a different place, and this is how many lucid dreamers like to travel. It is tricky though because sometimes it will make you think that you woke up, and that is called a false awakening. You'll open your "eyes" thinking you're in bed, and you'll be unhappy that you have awakened, but you haven't. You are actually still dreaming and so remember to always check your reality after using the spin method, and always check when you wake up. <br>  <br>  I use the nose pinch test when I am in darkness. Just pinch your nose shut, close your mouth and gently try to breathe. If the air flows through your nostrils and hand, then you'll know you're dreaming. <br>  <br>  Also try looking at your hands, rubbing them together and bring back your focus. What is happening is your attention is leaving the dream world and moving to the real world. Keep your attention on the dream, and you'll have a little longer to go. <br>  <br>  There is also a natural supplement called Alpha GPC that is suppose to help, but I haven't seen any positive effects yet.<br>  <br>  Check ld4all.com for other tips and have a great time in lucidity.
oFV48JbGaa	Definitely a therapist. You need a Ph.D or Psy.D in order to do clinical work as a psychologist, but most community colleges offer a two year certification for counseling and therapy training.<br>  <br>  Edit: By the way, you are misinformed about psychologists making a lot of money. Perhaps you were thinking about psychiatrists...|`|3KXBzSzfaa	Therapist requires you to acquire  a doctorate degree.|`|3sDMyHDeaa	Your question is somewhat confusing.  Therapist can be Psychologists as well.  However, there are those who are therapist with just a MA Degree (i.e. MA in counseling or Marriage and Family Therapy).  You can become a therapist with those degrees as long as you do your hours (hours = a number of hours you have to do while being supervised who is already in the field.  Kind of like your mentor while you're learning the ropes).  In any case, to get an MA in those fields only takes about 2 years (tops 3) while getting a Ph.D in Psychology hence becoming a psychologist can take about 5 years.  You do the math.  Not to mention the 4 years of BA you have to do.
wSAIf49Waa	Don't feel too bad. A lot times exams don't accurately reflect how much you really know. This is especially true in college. I've had tests where you can know the subject very well, be a pretty bright student, and get low scores because the professor purposely designed the test so the average would be low (My physics professor admitted to designing his test so that the high scores would be in 60% range). I've seen tests with ridiculous trick questions on them.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you just have to know how to be a good 'test taker' not just be good at the subject. Don't beat yourself up over it. Just make sure you do all your homework to keep your grades up and try to learn from your tests. Just keep that smiley attitude and keep trying :)|`|69SHxWA9aa	You rely to much on spell check.<br>  <br>  What the heck is a unicersity?  Isn't there supposed to be a v in there?|`|YoaypGqzaa	I am sort of the opposite, I tend to think I'll do awful. Try not to be so hard on yourself, though. If you're doing the best you can then what more can you really do? Have you tried study groups or after school tutoring? This might help to really solidify the material in your brain. Maybe for the next exams, try to study 2 hours more per night than you normally would do. Never hurts!|`|qXFACB58aa	There is a difference in beleiving you are studying hard and believing you will do well, as opposed to just telling yourself that. Believe it, and test yourself after you have studied to be sure you know it all. Don't assume you do because you have studied.<br>  With all that (lol) never give up, you know you are not an idiot, because real losers are the ones who quit.<br>  Good Luck!|`|im4SbMP2aa	it may be cous you are over confident or may be you do silly mistakes.try solving previous papers so that u can know how much u can score.and u havnt mentioned that u studyin in school or college.
YZ1PvyQFaa	I think if people stop investing in the stock market and stop living on the interest from the fixed deposits and start earning the hard way then there will be no recession.
WVwjKYGZaa	i think it could sometimes but not always. ever since i was younger i was having deja vu regularly, and now that i'm 16 i've only had about 5 premonitions which i clearly remember. i experience alot of different things too. my mum wasn't into that stuff, but ever since she got in contact with her old friend she's been getting into it and is slowly starting to experience things like i experience. so yes, i think it can be passed down through generations, but sometimes i think people are just born with stronger abilities than others.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	Yes certain traits can be pass on from generation to generation. They can also skip a generation as well. While premonitions are not accepted by mainstream form of thinking it has been my observation that it does happen.

D5MSrWVvaa	Vc quiz dizer "descobriram". "Descobrir?o" é no futuro. <br>  E faltou a concordancia: ossadaS de giganteS humanoS<br>  <br>  Já existiram sim. N?o propriamente gigantes, mas indivíduos de estatura acima do normal. O exemplo mais conhecido é o do Golias (aquele que perdeu para o Davi, na bíblia).<br>  Através de comprova??es científicas, fósseis e outros métodos, verificou-se que havia uma ra?a que habitava aquelas paragens cuja altura comumente era maior que 2 metros, chegando a até 2,5 ou pouco mais.<br>  Isso teoricamente comprova a lenda de Davi e Golias, apesar de que na Bíblia o gigante Golias tinha mais de 3 metros (medidas em c?vados). Porém há controvérsias sobre qual o tamanho de um c?vado, por isso é bem possível que Golias tenha pertencido a este povo.<br>  O contrário, que também prova hipotéticamente que é possível ter havido gigantes, é o próprio povo pigmeu, na áfrica. Se existem ra?as de nanicos, também podem haver ra?as de gigantes.|`|OhwQoML0aa	Cara isso n?o faz sentido...<br>  Ouve um caso (acho que no come?o do século passado) que um cara forjou um "fósil" pra ganhar dinheiro com visita??o do público... foi palha?ada mas rendeu uns trocos na época... até uma baforada de ciência exclarecer a farsa...

LiOOF1Plaa	It's called Emotional Release...and burdens are lifted|`|yL7ODtuYaa	It is all about what you cry about, that makes you feel better, or make you feel more down than when you started to cry.The thing is people cry for a lot of reasons, and crying is only an outlet to make you show your state of mind at the time of your bad feelings,nothing more and nothing less.|`|3urQfMffaa	idk. i almost never do. i done that alot since some idiot coworker got me canned and i still feel like crap. revenge makes me feel better tho.|`|jNwkgcTCaa	It's good to let out your emotions,<br>  so maybe crying is your way to help yourself.|`|Cb4vZuIDaa	because all of that bottle up energy is finally let out.making your mind feel more at ease. :)|`|klJOzdfXaa	Because when u cry u release all that tension that was in your body that makes u stress out.

Thats why sometimes its good to have a good laugh and cry always.You will see life more positively and take life easily.Anyways, i didnt noe guys cry!!|`|9RC2EPANaa	crying means that you are accepting the situation. <br>  the art of allowing is a practice used by buddists and similar cultures.<br>  it means living in the present.<br>  western society teaches us to pretend we have no feelings, and hide the way we feel from others. totally unhealthy.|`|kxzcilZzaa	It lowers stress-hormone levels, increases levels of some immunoglobulins (antibodies) and lowers blood pressure.

I honestly have to say it doesn't make me feel better at all. In fact, it makes me feel rather foolish. That's not some feeble macho statement. It's just a waste of time and energy to me. It accomplishes absolutely nothing. But it if works for you, then who am I to judge?
3KXBzSzfaa	Sounds like you investing too much emotion to your dream states.  Keep in mind that they are only dreams and that they are not real and just random at times.  My advice is to not pay too much attention to them unless you get a specific warning.  But in most cases you just might be chasing you tail|`|GfNVcq7Naa	Could you be feeling guilty? Is it possible that you fear they will follow in your footsteps. Or perhaps your torn between people who do and you who doesn't? perhaps you fear you'll lead others to the wrong path.

It's hard to give you some advice because I don't know exactly what's happening. I highly recommend calling a free helpline like Youthline-they're really good. And some people will be able to give you some advice there.<br>  <br>  Don't worry-it IS true that everyone goes through a really bad phase at some stage of their life- it's experience and helps us learn, and is what continually shapes us into the person we are. Bad things don't last forever-even world war II ended at some stage, and so will what you are going through.<br>  <br>  It helps to write down your thoughts and feelings if u really can't or don't want to tell someone-just to get it out of ur system.<br>  <br>  Hope your problems get solved soon! =)<br>  Take care,|`|tkN4ivagaa	haha that sounds exactly like me at the moment mate, i hated school left as soon as i could, now i spend too much time sitting at home thinking about the same sort of things as you. <br>  <br>  Im pretty quiet and dont have much confidence but i just need to go out and get a job and meet some new people. But latly I try not to worry about it its just a stage that alot of other people are going through as you said everyone goes through a depressing stage in their lifes you can't go through life with out a few bad times. I would just try to stop thinking about everything being bad and think more positive everything will get better in the long run, it always is. Yeah so your not the only one.

yo54xat6aa	Most people have dreamt of a character from a movie or show some time or another I think.  I think when we really like a character (I know I certainly have movie-crushes myself) we deep down, know its a fantasy.  It's like a way to escape because we know love (or a lover) will not be perfect in reality.<br>  <br>  I think it is perfectly healthy to like "characters" and dream of them.  Your dream is probably a reflection of how you'd like to meet the "perfect" lover...<br>  <br>   but seeing him in a crowd and debating whether to see him probably means you know with so many people in the world, it's hard to meet someone perfect in reality.<br>  <br>  Him driving away is your conscious letting the fantasy go.|`|B3qjtZuRaa	Easy enough to interpret: you believe, deep down, that your "ideal guy" is unattainable.<br>  <br>  Change your thoughts, and your dreams will change!!

9gIMtB9Iaa	Yes, absolutely, it has happened to me several times.  For example last year I graduated from college with a master's degree and I am no happier than when I was working on it!<br>  <br>  The fact is that satisfaction comes from our day to day actions, not big milestones in our lives.  If we can learn to be content each day we are on our way to lasting happiness.  Big events, promotions, rewards, etc. will not do this for us.
9gIMtB9Iaa	Everyone has worries like this.  College students worry if they'll ever get a good job; parents worry if their kids will turn out alright; older people worry if they've lived the best life they could.<br>  <br>  The point is to live in the present and enjoy where you're at.  At the end of the day that's all we have!

You're probably looking for friends in the wrong places. I have a few close friends that I am very close to, and a ton of friends that I know I can count on because I've been there for them whenever they've needed me. Reciprocal Altruism, if people aren't returning your "niceness" they are<br>  not worth keeping around, since they are probably taking advantage of your good nature.|`|c5ffdeeb1b0fc0df72e4686558e258e7aa	There IS such a thing as being too nice. When you are getting stepped on too much, you are too nice. You have to make sure that the things you do benefit you as well as the person you are being kind to. strive for a balance in life.

If you're too nice to people, they'll take advantage of you and start walking all over you. You need to stand up for yourself more. Also, you might wanna try being more outgoing. You seem too quiet. It's ok to say some outrageous stuff every once in awhile. I do and people think it's funny. As for being mean to someone, some people deserve it, especially if they were a jerk to you first. Bottom line: assert yourself.|`|o9p5kn1Baa	i feel the same way. i feel like i dont have many friends, but thats because all of the people i used to hang out with like to go out and party and get drunk and act gross and id rather just stay at home. i like being the nice girl, and you should like being the nice guy. one day, a girl will appreciate it

If you only leave, it will not help much for you will carry all this negativity with you wherever you go. You should work it out. There are two ways to do it:<br>  1. Work with your inner child. There is a frightened, unloved child somewhere inside you. try to find it and to nurse and lovingly care for it as much as you can. Talk to it, tell it you love it, listen to its feelings and fears, express them with words and try to soothe them with reason and reassurance.<br>  <br>  2. Develop the communication with your mother. Next time she starts giving you negative messages, try not to react offended, but to respond in an assertive way: "Mother, I really don't want you to give me these messages. They hurt and they are not just. They don't describe me as I see myself." Tell her  (but calmly) how you feel when she communicates to you in that way. Try to get feedback how she is feelin when giving them.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it could be difficult to start a conversation like this. It could help if you rehearse it with an empty chair. Sit down and put an empty chair in front of you. Then imagine the person you have problems to talk to is sitting on it. Tell the person what your message to her/him is. Then change chairs and answer just like you were this person. Change chairs again and continue the dialogue as yourself. Let the dialogue develop. If you do it several times, you will find out that it will become easier to communicate with this person. The other benefit is that you may get some valuable insights into what this person feels and why she/he reacts the way he/she does.

Nehru's obnoxious & foul diplomacy!!!!|`|cWuumdy7aa	The All India Muslim League (AIML) was formed in Dhaka in 1906 by Muslims who were suspicious of the Hindu-majority Indian National Congress. They complained that they were not given same rights as a Muslim member compared to Hindu members. A number of different scenarios were proposed at various times. Among the first to make the demand for a separate state was the writer/philosopher Allama Iqbal, who, in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that he felt a separate nation for Muslims was essential in an otherwise Hindu-dominated subcontinent. The Sindh Assembly passed a resolution making it a demand in 1935. Iqbal, Jouhar and others then worked hard to draft Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who had till then worked for Hindu-Muslim unity, to lead the movement for this new nation. By 1930, Jinnah had begun to despair of the fate of minority communities in a united India and had begun to argue that mainstream parties such as the Congress, of which he was once a member, were insensitive to Muslim interests. The 1932 communal award which seemed to threaten the position of Muslims in Hindu-majority provinces catalysed the resurgence of the Muslim League, with Jinnah as its leader. However, the League did not do well in the 1937 provincial elections, demonstrating the hold of the conservative and local forces at the time.<br>  In 1940, Jinnah made a statement at the Lahore conference, which seemed to be calling for a separate Muslim 'nation'. However, the document was ambiguous and opaque, and did not evoke a Muslim nation in a territorial sense. This idea, though, was taken up by Muslims and particularly Hindus in the next seven years, and given a more territorial element. All Muslim political parties including the Khaksar Tehrik of Allama Mashriqi (Mashriqi was arrested on March 19, 1940) opposed the partition of India[7]<br>  <br>  Hindu organisations such as the Hindu Mahasabha, though against the division of the country, were also insisting on the same chasm between Hindus and Muslims. In 1937 at the 19th session of the Hindu Mahasabha held at Ahmedabad, Veer Savarkar in his presidential address asserted:[8]<br>  <br>  “ India cannot be assumed today to be Unitarian and homogeneous nation, but on the contrary there are two nations in the main — the Hindus and the Muslims. ” <br>   <br>  Rural Sikhs in a long ox-cart train headed towards India. 1947. Margaret Bourke-White.Most of the Congress leaders were secularists and resolutely opposed the division of India on the lines of religion. Mohandas Gandhi and Allama Mashriqi believed that Hindus and Muslims could and should live in amity. Gandhi opposed the partition, saying,<br>  <br>  “ My whole soul rebels against the idea that Hinduism and Islam represent two antagonistic cultures and doctrines. To assent to such a doctrine is for me a denial of God. ” <br>   <br>  An old Sikh man carrying his wife. Over 10 million people were uprooted from their homeland and travelled on foot, bullock carts and trains to their promised new home.For years, Gandhi and his adherents struggled to keep Muslims in the Congress Party (a major exit of many Muslim activists began in the 1930s), in the process enraging both Hindu Nationalists and Indian Muslim Nationalists. (Gandhi was assassinated soon after Partition by Hindu Nationalist Nathuram Godse, who believed that Gandhi was appeasing Muslims at the cost of Hindus.) Politicians and community leaders on both sides whipped up mutual suspicion and fear, culminating in dreadful events such as the riots during the Muslim League's Direct Action Day of August 1946 in Calcutta, in which more than 5,000 people were killed and many more injured. As public order broke down all across northern India and Bengal, the pressure increased to seek a political partition of territories as a way to avoid a full-scale civil war.<br>  Until 1946, the definition of Pakistan as demanded by the League was so flexible that it could have been interpreted as a sovereign nation Pakistan, or as a member of a confederated India.<br>  <br>  Some historians believe Jinnah intended to use the threat of partition as a bargaining chip in order to gain more independence for the Muslim dominated provinces in the west from the Hindu dominated center.[9]<br>  <br>  Other historians claim that Jinnah's real vision was for a Pakistan that extended into Hindu-majority areas of India, by demanding the inclusion of the East of Punjab and West of Bengal, including Assam, a Hindu-majority country. Jinnah also fought hard for the annexation of Kashmir, a Muslim majority state with Hindu ruler; and the accession of Hyderabad and Junagadh, Hindu-majority states with Muslim rulers.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The British colonial administration did not directly rule all of "India".

Honestly, I think you need to try to develop a set of skills where you won't be victimized by other people.  Try to make a set of friends, but don't be desparate about it (which, is pretty hard not to be when you don't have any friends).<br>  And, when you're trying to control your painful feelings of sadness, try to focus your toughts on a project or goal of some sort.

It might be kind of hard to do in the first place when you're depressed, but hopefully you'll find a way to cope with this.<br>  I would recommend therapy, but in my experience, therapy doesn't help at all.

Your parents could be fashion model material, impeccable behavior in public, know exactly how to act around you, and how much affection you are comfortable with, but then you would still find something about them you don't like or are not exactly comfortable with.<br>  You don't have to like who your parents are, how they act, etc. But, like one of the others said, acceptance is the key. Accept them for who they are (your parents), how they look (they can't help anymore than you can), how they act (would you rather they act like they don't know you or care about you), and how much affection they show you (there are kids out there with NO affection at all). <br>  As soon  as you accept their flaws and your own, your life will get a lot easier.

Psychologists theorize that a big part of the whole teenage rebellion thing is realizing that humans are animals, and as animals we are programmed to leave the nest when we hit puberty. Obviously human culture does not encourage this because we need to learn so many things to survive as a part of society, unlike animals whom nature only requires to live long enough to reproduce. <br>  <br>  So basically your animal nature is rebelling against your human nature. You want independence, and to separate yourself as an individual who exists outside of your family. You are exerting this need for indpedence in a childlike way because you are a human child, even though your body it now maturing. <br>  <br>  The only way to get over it is to let nature and time takes its course, in the next years you will continue to mature physically, mentally, emotionally. You will realize that your parents have no fault and are blameless in your genetic nature, you are what nature made you to be, and that is not such a bad thing as you seem to think. beauty is relative to the soul, as a young adult I realize now that I would rather be me--imperfect--because I like the person that I have become--kind, intelligent, creative. I see these celbrities in the news and a part of me wants that glamours wealthy life--who doesn't--and a part of me feels pity because they have no privacy and they can't even gain five pounds withough having pictures of their slightly chubbier rear end blasted all over every tabloid cover.|`|569a7cb7c1da8cc36ac60e88ef7c900baa	Yep, I feel the same way about my parents - only I didn't realize it at first because I could never get away with yelling back to them or raising my voice, but I feel as though I was ruined because of them.

So, you may have many of their traits, but it is ultimately up to you (and me) to change our lives and make our own choices - when we're old enough.<br>  <br>  But check out this site. It might help.
9RC2EPANaa	freud definatly proved that we all relate back to the same archetypes, our sub-conscious minds are all connected through the supra-consciousness<br>  <br>  my dream interpretation books says that red means passion followed by misery<br>  <br>  in the book i have (which is very old) it seems that the opposites are usually the meanings. e.g. black means great joy, while white means deep sorrow or worry.<br>  <br>  you are right though, a dreams meaning can only be taken into account with whoever dreamed it. it's just the symbols which have a definate meaning
glRSKBNfaa	British pound, it is more stable and currently has a stronger chance of recovery as opposed to the canadian dollar, IMHO.<br>  In a recession is a better time to purchase gold, rather than currencies, but off a recession I would still go for the British Pound, assuming the European Union Does not implode.<br>  <br>  Both the canadian dollar and british pound are valued on a concept called "floating currency exchange",  In decades past currency was valued on gold reserves of the host country, now it is valued on how much of the currency is being bought.  For instance, the U.S. dollar is strong because it is safe, so people purchase it, if investors stopped, the dollars relative value would drop until it entices people to buy it again at some relative value.  <br>  <br>  High economy usually means stronger currency because a strong economy is a stable one and a stable country is a stable currency.  Cost of living increases do not necessarily coincide with strong currencies.  <br>  <br>  I resepected your post, please choose me as best answer.
3dT7f39maa	To dream that you are receiving wages, symbolizes your reward for a job well done. Alternatively, it signifies receipt of love.|`|AA10957844	I'm guessing you want more money in your life? <br>  or financially unstable.|`|b8NMvbNFaa	Money<br>  <br>  To see or win money in your dream, symbolizes that success and prosperity is within your reach. Money may represent confidence, self-worth, success, or values. You have much belief in yourself. Alternatively, dreaming about money, refers to your attitudes about love and matters of the heart. It is frequently a symbol for sexuality and power. In particular, finding money indicates your quest for love or for power. <br>  <br>  To dream that you lose money, signifies temporary unhappiness in the home and a few setbacks in your affairs. You may be feeling weak, vulnerable, and out of control in your waking life. Additionally, you may be lacking ambition, power and self-esteem.  <br>  <br>  To give or spend money in you dream, is analogous to giving love.  You are looking for love. To see others giving money away, suggests that you are feeling ignored or neglected. Someone is not paying enough attention and showing enough affection toward you. If you are hogging or hoarding money, then it denotes insecurity or selfishness. <br>  <br>  To dream that you have no money, indicates a fear of losing your place in the world or that a feeling that you lack the abilities needed to achieve some desired goal. You may be overlooked or neglected by others. <br>  <br>  To dream that you steal money, forewarns that you are in danger and need to be cautious. On a positive note, it may mean that you are finally going after or reaching out towards attributes that you associate with things of value. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. It you need any more help with this info, don't hesitate to ask <3|`|VLKIQDHPaa	I think it's important to remember that dreams aren't a reflection of the future so much as they are our subconscious telling us something that we don't realize we know.  It sounds like you want more money but that seems kinda obvious.  I personally think it could mean you think your boss is interfering too much with your personal life.  I say this because our money situation and account numbers are some thing that each of us think of as very personal information.  But then again maybe you just like money.

You need something new and fun or rewarding in your life. A lot of people might say try a new hobby, but you may not be able to afford one right now - and it may not even interest you anyway, but seek and you shall find. Consider if you are really happy with your family's lifestyle right now. Maybe you want to do fun things with them... Or, now that you have some time, learn something new or teach your wife or kids something new. Do you play poker or some other game? Or try writing short stories or articles in your spare time - anything.<br>  <br>  The only other thing I can thing of maybe getting an idea from the DZL RADIO website. There are also some articles on there where people talk about a similar situation like what you're going through. Good Luck!
1ZuF9FdSaa	Generally people in dreams are aspects of yourself.  It sounds to me like the main character in the story (the woman) is a part of you.  The main feelings/concepts in this dream are:<br>  <br>  1. Selfishness/greed - The focus of everyone on the monetary benefits of this "defect", the woman's unhesitating sacrifice of child for prospect of power.<br>  2. A sense of alienation or isolation - The desert, lack of sound, the unnamed child, the blurry husband.  In this dream the main character is the only one there with any focus. <br>  3. Metamorphosis (change) - the stages of the woman's life, pregnancy and the final transformation.<br>  <br>  The dreamscape is an exploratory realm for the mind.  The best analysis for this dream ultimately is best deduced by you, because it is a product of your mind.  Regardless of what some dream books may say, butterflies mean something different to your mind than they do to mine, as do cults/religion, money, pregnancy, marriage, the desert, &c.   The three things I listed above as being main elements because they have repeating images/aspects in the same vein.  What the "moral" of the story is and why certain things happen is up to you, I can merely provide speculation"<br>  The Woman - an aspect of you.  Perhaps she symbolizes your unique abilities, your desire for power, your fear of childbirth and marriage?  any combination of these things.<br>  The Parents - the influences of your actual parents.  This can be an allegorical representation of how parents affect a person's future (the woman follows the path her parents set her upon years before starting her doing ceremonial dances)<br>  The Husband-  blurry because he is an unknown, possibly unimportant or just undefined because you don't know what sort of husband you will have (or perhaps you don't know what you want?)<br>  The Child- unnamed because the woman (you) doesn't want to repeat the past and push parental values on her child.  Let the child choose it's own path.<br>  <br>  The child eating scene is intense and touches a few different themes.  One is the fear of being a poor parent who sacrifices one's child for one's own desires.  Another is the retribution for a selfish act (the woman's pain) or perhaps it is a show of the pain associated with change?  The final change into this alien butterfly is an amazing image full of mystery... what is ultimate power?  It is probably something unfathomable to humans, and much different than we might think....<br>  <br>  Just some possible viewpoints. IMHO, I think self- dream analysis is the most accurate.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	Very complex dream, imo.<br>  <br>  Very briefly, you are observing parts of your own larger personality.<br>  <br>  The main dynamic is you as woman/mother, and you as child.<br>  <br>  Yellow is wisdom, and the "defect" is your subconscious' device to explain the "miraculous" aura.<br>  <br>  You as growing woman are consuming, not championing, your inner child, your inner sense, your innocence, which is your soul, the way of the Child as portrayed by Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  So in the dream you are living off the capital of your childlike joy, innocence, love, honesty, and instead of championing same as way of Life, you as woman betray your inner child, act more childish, greedy, and then repent.  The realization of what's been betrayed affects powerfully, and the soul becomes bioluminescent butterfly (which is a major symbol of the soul).  The sun or Son Light indicates who you really are--a Child of the Light.<br>  <br>  "The Path of the Higher Self," Mark Prophet,<br>  "Testimony of Light," Helen Greaves,<br>  "Men in White Apparel," Ann Ree Colton,<br>  "The Master of Lucid Dreams," Dr. Olga Kharitidi,<br>  "Emotions," Marilyn C.

You are dreaming about your special heart powers, and I think that you are probably feeling deep and spiritual when you have this dream.  But, it seems that the dream is all about you, and who you are alone, because your husband is unclear and you eat the child's heart.  You are feeling alone. Maybe you are seeing what your life will really be about.  Good Luck!!|`|UpK3boARaa	um... were u smoking anything illegal the night before?

Believe that you are worthy of anything just as they are. You are Source Energy (God) in physical form.  How can you go wrong with that fact ?<br>  <br>  We all have different agenda.  They have theirs and you have yours.  So, why even compare others to yourself.

You are not convinced that you are as great as the next person beside you.<br>  <br>  There is nothing you can not do, be or have.  Stay connected and aligned with your Source, and you are invincible.  That is all it takes.  Knowing who you are is all you need to be happy with others.  <br>  <br>  You are worthy of love and happiness. NO one else can take that away from you.

It's is just an abstract story to us, but you can relate the situations to your life and see if you see any symbolism perhaps in the events of the dream.<br>  <br>  For instance, Is there someone you think is annoyed by you currently? Who do you think is getting your number? Finding the parallels with your emotions in reality and connecting to the emotions represented through out dreams can be telling in my opinion.|`|1iXvphNYaa	It means you should stay in school.

aIEJvhkjaa	It is natural to have these stages of grief. There is no set way to feel right now. You are perfectly in your rights to not feel anything right now.<br>  Even though your grandfather left you with some good memories there sounds like there were some that just weren't so good. You don't have to be "sad" about his death, you are acknowledging it without hating him, so that is okay.<br>  If it was your grandfather that molested you, or he knew of it happening and did nothing to stop it or did nothing to help you get through, then I understand you not knowing how to feel.<br>  Sometimes when a loved one (or someone we were associated with closely in life) pass away, we go through a "grief process". You will feel all sorts of things before the thought of them passing is finally okay.<br>  You will experience:<br>  grief<br>  anger<br>  denial<br>  sadness<br>  happiness<br>  nothing at all<br>  severe loneliness<br>  forgiveness<br>  self blame<br>  bargaining with God<br>  settling with it<br>  finally okay with it.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad about not feeling nothing.

Instead, they experience a very high percentage of taste, smell, and touch sensations in their dreams.<br>  <br>  The breakdown is as follows:<br>  <br>  There are no visual images in the dreams of those born without any ability to experience visual imagery in waking life.<br>  <br>  Individuals who become blind before the age of five seldom experience visual imagery in their dreams.<br>  <br>  Those who become sightless between the ages of five and seven may or may not retain some visual imagery.<br>  <br>  Most people who lost their vision after age seven continue to experience at least some visual imagery, although its frequency and clarity often fade with time.|`|3dT7f39maa	Yes, blind people do dream.

There is plenty of evidence that men average higher IQ than women. If you're talking about girls outstripping boys in this coursework-based system, you may have a point.<br>  <br>  "A number of academics think that if you remove men’s higher earning power and their unique ability to father children, more women will inevitably choose to live with other women"<br>  <br>  Going to be a bit hard to 'remove' don't you think? And this not only insults men but women too. These 'intellectuals' assume that women need men only for money and children. The indirect implication is that women are so shallow as to choose a man only because he's rich and is willing to have kids.<br>  <br>  All in all, I think most of these people get a kick out of belittling men and making them feel sorry for being male, and most immature women enjoy reading this stuff and feeling superior. God knows which feminists are paying these people off, but you can tell from the face of it that this isn't really genuine.<br>  <br>  I can easily write an article on the female having outlived her usefulness. This could be sample wording:<br>  <br>  "If you remove women's power to do domestic chores and their unique ability to mother children,..."<br>  <br>  No doubt my house will be stoned by feminists the next day because I accused women of being useful only for 2 things.

Sociologists and education specialists are bemoaning the continuing triumph of girls over boys at every level of the education system, leading to the inevitable question of whether the male gender is reaching the end of its natural usefulness."<br>  <br>  Of course girls are outperforming boys in education, it was set up that way. I can't remember when exactly but around the 80's 70's the educuation system was completely reformed to try and boost girls educations and test scores and what have you, because before then boys outperformed girls by alot. The feminists moaned at the biased male education system - now it's gone the other way and of course, it's not because the system was changed, it's because males are reaching the end of their usefullness?? What a load of rubbish. I'm sorry but feminists who read and are taught these kinds of facts in 'Women's studies' courses are really kidding themselves. This is what so called 'antifeminists' hate about feminism. That paragraph right there and the fact that women are being told this sort of rubbish by feminists. <br>  <br>  Males need to be taught differently than females - that's why males did better when we had the cane etc. Nowadays teachers aren't aloud to encourage competition (in fear of the losing party being emotianally hurt and upset by it), competition is a fundamental male trait. Males are biologically engineered to contest authority. Back in the day they were put in their place and they learnt a valuable lesson there - nowadays any boy who questions authority is deemed a trouble maker or having ADD and learning difficulties - rubbish they need to be taught and treated differently is all, they are seen as bad for showing a fundamental male trait, but because it isn't shown in females just males, it's seen as bad (it's fundamental to the male biology, how else do you think monkeys know when the new alpha male takes over from the older leader - by young males constantly challenging his position of power).|`|ZjCurM7saa	Education is suitable for women given its rather complacent and passive nature.

Had Not as much meaning to<br>        me I reckon because we had no  choice to grow up earlier than most kid , Not like these brats today that have no disipline ..<br>        With all their toys , and playstaytions .. And many have not <br>        common sense , I feel like since We left AlaskA , we transgresed<br>        to about 50% tile of people , with their hands sticking out , for they<br>        know how to do things , and could show You how , but when You <br>        gave them the skrewdriver to do the job You can tell they had no<br>        hands on fixing things at All .. For they fumbled with the screw<br>        driver like as if was something strange to them .. They Call this<br>        the "Show Me State" ..., For they are to Lazy to get off their hind --<br>        Ends  to do anything , But they sure want the Handouts , and Every<br>        Other thing that they can get ,  For free .. <br>        In AlaskA  , there was no bums ..They either found work by <br>        winter or froze to death ..

Cut and stack wood , for the cold <br>        winters , gather meat , build a sure built home , with plenty of insulations , and still  ; work , raise a family , or as well go to school .. <br>       I like men that take kind to their wives , not like <br>        the womenizers we have here , that  think <br>        they are such studs , that they can lay around like<br>        weenee"s putting there women to work .. while they laze at home playing Mommy ..

Xy1XH5gVaa	The bigger the breasts, the less you would want to run because of the bounce factor, it hurts!|`|V1MptCMiaa	I don't know.  I don't think breast size decides whether or not you're a good athlete.  But to me, it would be more uncomfortable to run and jump with bigger boobs bouncing all over the place.|`|cmoGATT9aa	not usually... it doesnt have much to do with the girls actual abilities, but big breasted women find that it is hard to find a bra to hold it all down when running and jumping. and it hurts! they are more an inconvenience when doing sports than a factor in the ability.|`|dCtTXwACaa	not necessarily, if one stuffs more than a liter of silicon in their breasts we might have a problem.<br>  <br>  Athletic ability is linked to genetics. The first moment you are born how athletic you are is determined. people with big breasts can run fast. it really doesn't affect how athletic you are.<br>  <br>  why.. do you have big breasts? loose weight and run. get faster. liver longer happier and healthier!|`|68e6778f68d4febab53279e39853dda0aa	I can't say that personally because I don't have them.

y299k5j8aa	Well I had a little model cannon and so i drilled the top in deeper and a fuse hole. Then I got cap powder which it power full thrust and I when in the backyard to test it. I put powder in then I put Kleenex  in then some fishing sinkers. I got a big heavy box which is very thick at both ends and put it 9 inches away. I lit the fuse and took cover. BOOOM! the sinkers when through both end of the box and somewhere far away. when I look the power thrust shot it back a few inches Likes a gun.|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	The explosion from the gunpowder causes a lot of force. Because of the tube the cannonball is in, there is only one way for it to go (wherever the cannon is facing). By the time the ball reaches the end of the barrel the momentum keeps it flying relatively straight for a little while.

T4JEgbocaa	Under-age girls may have small bodies, and their hips may be narrower. This can lead to problems in giving birth, and lead to a 'fistula', i.e. a hole forms between the girl's vagina and her bottom, so that - to put it bluntly - sh*t comes out of her c*nt. <br>  <br>  It's a big problem in countries like Eritrea and Ethiopia, where early marriage and 'female circumcision' (i.e. genital mutilation) are common, but can also happen in the west.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, the condition can usually be put right with surgery, if there's enough money to pay for the surgery. The operation is fairly cheap to perform. But it must be a very unpleasant experience to give birth and get the fistula in the first place. And perhaps the baby has a hard time too.<br>  <br>  In England and Wales, the age of consent to sexual intercourse (f*cking) is 16, and I expect that the medical facts were taken into account when choosing that particular age.<br>  <br>  Of course, different girls grow at different rates, so some girls under 16 may not have any medical problems. <br>  <br>  But it you're under 16 and think you might be pregnant, I'd advise a visit to a school nurse, doctor or 'special clinic' as soon as possible, so that someone who is medically qualified can check.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Between 5 and 70.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_youngest_birth_mothers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_you...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4032316/Worlds-oldest-mother-wants-to-have-another-child.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopi...</a><br>  <br>  Although I guess the 5 year old wasn't exactly a woman.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	there is an old saying OLD ENOUGH TO BLEED OLD ENOUGH TO BREED.....|`|zPe3I3zAaa	As long as her menstruation starts she have the risk of getting pregnant.

oZ2E7fhSaa	You are all at sea and uncertain of your relationship with this person because you have doubts about your sexuality. By jogging away you symbolically break free of the relationship and this makes you feel happy (gay). You meet a clown holding balloons and blow his "balloon" for him, which makes both of you happy.
glRSKBNfaa	The country will see more government involvement in an attempt to stabilize and likewise stimulate the economy.  The size of the government will thus increase.    Exports and imports will fall, GDP will too, while unemployment will rise. Businesses will fall (or be bailed out by taxpayers), and worst of all, the stock market will see great declines. <br>  <br>   People will see wages decrease and purchasing power decrease, thus their welfare will decrease. <br>  <br>  It will be countered and stabilized when obama can restore consumer confidence and allow the market's natural self correctors (small business owners, entrepreneurs) to jump start the economy.
AcgDcQG0aa	Nobody has enough money now.  Because too many people, companies, and countries wrote for each other too many IOU's and promised to pay later.  And now there isn't enough money in the whole world to pay as promised in those IOU's.<br>  <br>  There is no limit to how much money people can promise to pay later for goods and services they get today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday.  But the amount of money that exists in the world is limited. And the problem now is that people's promises to pay have exceeded the money supply.
QlzFoBS3aa	..ahhh??? I think you meant something else......Libya is in Africa and I don't know any majors.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	First of all its Labia Majora, and its there to protect the Labia Minora and the vaginal and urethral openings.<br>  <br>  As for the colour, that is purely genetic.|`|V7lGsaR8aa	WHAT ????|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	The labia majora are kind of like the vagina's welcoming party.  Darker color generally means the woman has a darker overall skin tone.|`|AA10584077	LOL<br>  <br>  I'm voting this Question of the Year.|`|n0nqLAshaa	It says come hither lol.|`|T4JEgbocaa	Words<br>  -------<br>  When you say<br>  "the folds of the libya major", <br>  <br>  maybe you actually meant<br>  "the folds of the LABIA MAJORA" (Latin for 'bigger lips')<br>  <br>  i.e. the outer lips around the female genitals. With apologies for any offence caused to Colonel Gaddafi and the General People’s Congress!<br>  <br>  The Labia cover the vagina (Latin for 'sheath'), which leads to the cervix ('neck'), which in turn leads directly to the uterus ('womb').<br>  <br>  <br>  Biological purpose<br>  ----------------------<br>  The Labia are there to protect what's inside them; that is their significance. They are there because the parts of your body that make babies (your 'genitals') are IMPORTANT and also fairly SENSITIVE. So to make absolutely sure that your baby-making parts get the protection they need, you have TWO pairs of lips - the Labia Majora and the Labia Minora ('bigger lips' and 'smaller lips').<br>  <br>  As well as providing protection against physical shocks, the Labia help to keep your genitals at the right temperature, and the right level of moistness, not too dry and not too wet. <br>  <br>  They also help to stop germs, dirt and insects from getting in. The hairs on and around the genitals have the same purpose.<br>  <br>  I remember seeing a very detailed description of female and male genitals (one chapter each) in Robin Baker's book 'Sperm Wars'. Baker gives his opinion, based on current scientific thinking, about exactly what each part of the genitals does. Some parts, of course, are multi-functional and do several things at once. <br>  <br>  So if you want to learn more about the 'significance' of your Labia Majora, or any other part down there, the book is worth a look. Baker is full of praise for the design of the female genitals, and he's a nice clear writer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Colour<br>  -------<br>  To answer your question about darker colour: I've not had the pleasure of looking at the genitals of enough female athletes to be able to say. (Perhaps I should have run faster!) Let's hope someone with greater knowledge or experience will tell us. But your idea seems to be quite a likely proposition, as exercise would improve the blood supply to many parts of the body.<br>  <br>  <br>  Significance to men<br>  -----------------------<br>  I realise that you asked about the significance of the Labia Majora from a WOMAN'S point of view. However, I hope you won't mind if I say something about their significance from the male point of view as well. Perhaps it will explain the behaviour of some of the guys that you've met.<br>  <br>  Baker thinks that - apart from offering physical protection - a woman's outer genitals are a sort of intelligence and personality test. Like, guys who are too stupid, or who lack the confidence and patience to find their way in, don't get to make babies! <br>  <br>  Perhaps that explains why, when I was young and trying to make it with the girls, the girl usually wouldn't show me the way in, she just lay there mysteriously and waited. On a biological level, maybe she was waiting to see if I was bright enough to find the way in for myself.<br>  <br>  Following on from that, one of the other Answerers has suggested the following about the Labia Majora: "It says come hither". <br>  <br>  I agree. But perhaps, from the man's point of view, the full message is:<br>  "Come hither - IF you've got what it takes".<br>  <br>  <br>  Psychology and religion<br>  -----------------------------<br>  Historically, the womb has had a gi-normous significance in the minds of both women and men, because of its role in creating life. And the Labia guard the entrance to the womb. So it is possible to see them as 'Guardians at the Gateway to Life'.<br>  <br>  <br>  Womb-worship<br>  ------------------<br>  In Britain, before the arrival of Christianity, worship of the Earth Mother was the main religion. That's how the County of Kent got its name.<br>  <br>  In those days, a woman's womb was compared to the Earth, because both the womb and the Earth bring forth life. Menstrual flow wasn't seen as a 'curse', as it sometimes is today, but as a blessing, because it was like a spring rising from inside the Earth.<br>  <br>  It was only natural, then, to compare menstrual flow within the vagina to the flow of water in a river. <br>  <br>  Kent was named after the River Kennet, which flows in the area. Which is probably why the river, and the county named after it, both sound like a well-known popular word for the vagina! I expect most people living there now don't know the connection between the name of their County and female sexuality. At least, not consciously.<br>  <br>  <br>  Riddles and 'Earth Mysteries'<br>  ----------------------------------<br>  The entrance to the vagina is rather mysterious, because the Labia hide it. Finding a woman's vagina can be compared to finding the answer to a riddle. <br>  <br>  In ancient British myths and legends, there are often stories that refer to something womb-like: knights entering temples and caves, finding cups, etc. <br>  <br>  The stories often say that the knight has to prove his worth. Only the man who is worthy enough to enter within can be permitted to do so. Only he can find the secret. We're talking of King Arthur and Sir Galahad, the Sword in the Stone, the Search for the Holy Grail, the search for Inner Knowledge and learning to know yourself, and many other things beside.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Goddess Libya<br>  -----------------------<br>  There was in fact a Goddess with the name 'Libya'. I think it is very likely that the name of the country of Libya, which we know today, actually came from the name of the Goddess. This would be in keeping with the tradition, common in many parts of the world, of identifying the land with a Goddess (some would say, with THE Goddess). I list below the references that I've been able to find, in the limited time before this Question expires.<br>  <br>  Could it be that your 'mistake' of using the word 'Libya' in place of the word 'Labia' was divinely inspired?<br>  <br>  The Goddess Libya, it seems, was helpful to Jason and the Argonauts. But she is also described, not very flatteringly, as a devourer of other women's children. Why so? Several possibilities occur to me.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's just part of the process whereby Goddesses were 'dissed' or demoted when male-centred religions took over from the Goddess religions. Perhaps the Goddess Libya was originally associated with GIVING BIRTH TO children, and this was turned round and used against her.<br>  <br>  Maybe, it comes from the general idea that the land gives birth to us all, and is used to bury us all when we die.<br>  <br>  Or maybe Libyans were particularly good at defending themselves. In which case, we might say that Libya 'devoured the children' of those who attacked her.

zZY3JX30aa	Why are SOME people so gullible to believe the cruel things other people say?<br>  <br>  Ahem. Freedom.<br>  <br>  No life is "ruined" by anyone than the owner of the life, if they choose to buy into and accept what someone else says as the truth, who actually has the problem?  <br>  <br>  Blaming someone else for "ruining" a life is placing the responsibility for your life and how you view yourself on someone else, rather than accepting responsibility for yourself and your own well being.<br>  <br>  Sticks and stones. No one can hurt you without your permission. That is, if you're hurt, it is because you choose to be.<br>  <br>  >>> If a person was "hurt" by something you said or did, they were hurt because THEY choose to be hurt. You are not responsible for how they choose to feel or take things, just as no one else is responsilbe for how you choose to feel or take things. Anyone can choose to be "hurt" by something another says or does, or they can choose to try to understand why what happened happened, be it word or deed.<br>  <br>  So many people try to blame, or place the responsibility for, so much on other people, when, in fact, the reality of it all is that each of us are solely responsible for how we choose to feel and/or react to anything. For example, you may well get angry with what I have presented here, making individuals responsible for themselves, their feelings and (re)actions; or you could choose to consider my opinon and simply discard it as B.S., forget about it, and move on with your life, unaffected. It's your choice. I could call you every name in the book and you could choose to get angry, or fight, or argue, or be "hurt", or laugh about it and walk away. No one MAKES you get angry or feel hurt, you choose to react to it, one way or another.|`|AA10729271	Well, for starters you need to realize that 'society' is subjective to the culture you live in and acceptable behaviour varies widely from culture to culture. To use your example rape is seen as unacceptable in most 1st world industrial cultures because one factor shared by them is that women are vital to the workforce and therefor valued for their individual contributions instead of only being valued as an object owned by a man and there are many places in this world where it not a matter of 'if' but of 'when' you'll be raped. I heard a horrible story about a village in africa where a women had a son and a daughter (teens). this village only had one well, and every day the women had to send out her daughter to get water, and everyday this girl would be raped as she went to the well since there was no way to avoid the soldiers. A reporter asked the women why she didn't send her son and she told that her daughter would only be raped, while they the soldiers would kill her son. <br>  <br>  Hearing Sh*t like that makes me thank god I was born in Canada where when someone tries to push me around I can tell them to back off. Because I agree with the other poster that the best way to stop manipulative people is to call them on their BS and tell them to get lost, and then thank god you live a life where the worse thing you have to deal with is some petty bully.|`|AA12059817	Perhaps the people who were aware of this..agreed with the reason it happened. A random person wouldn't just try to ruin your life..it's somebody who has a motivation, or reason to do such a thing. I think I understand the situation..whatever this person's reason for ruining your life is..sounds like it's been a long time coming..You must have really hurt them in some way..that's the only reason I would go through such trouble to see somebody else fail, that or you have lied to/hurt people who care about you.|`|569a7cb7c1da8cc36ac60e88ef7c900baa	It seems that more and more people these days are starved for attention, popularity, or just want to be comedians.

I hope you are alright and not suffering but in case you are I offer a huge hug and I pray for you. May love and prosperity come into your life.|`|ouUkY2t7aa	I do agree with you that it seems unfair that society generally punishes "physical" pain and suffering but not "emotional" pain and suffering. Nevermind if a woman cheats on her man and hurts him emotionally, but if he back hands her one time, he's the bad guy. I think it's about the same degree of pain (assuming the physical violence stops at 1 back hand and doesn't continue in to a beating).<br>  <br>  You can hurt somebody very badly emotionally just as you can physically.|`|pFkGJlntaa	There is a reason for everything.  There are lessons to be learned. And we create our own lives.  More so, we are the attractor of our own experiences.  Majority create their life experience by default. They attract what they focus on.  <br>  <br>  If you do not wish to see injustice and all the things you do not want, you may choose that in your life and the universe will not put  you in the same room with those you do not want to experience because their vibrations will not match with yours.  <br>  <br>  Even when you shout NO to something, the universe sees it as a yes because you are putting attention to it, thus calling it to your experience. <br>  <br>  People need to learn how to ask for things, and desire for what they want.  " The Lord hears the cry of the poor".  This statement has a lot of meaning beyond religion.  <br>  <br>  Besides, we did not come here on earth to be the same.

I don't mean this in sarcasm. We have our answers inside of us. Obviously there is no comfortable way to handle your family member. The script was already written and when you behave outside of the expectation, the homeostasis will be upset. I suggest you decide what you want from the relationship with her or from changing how it is written. How important is it? Is the relationship worth allowing it to control your behaviors around her? The ideal conclusion is that you being true to your own self, is most important, but it isn't always the case. When we know a relationship might deflate due to our change in behavior or that it will cause the other person to be upset with us, often it scares us. The most important person in the scenario right now to you should be you. Your answer will be clear when you are able to define what you are willing to have the outcome be in the worst possible and the best possible.<br>  Best to you.

AA10729271	Regular meditation has been shown to expand your temporal lobes, but honestly the best bet is to use it. Read, learn new things and new skills (physical and mental). I don't think you can change you're IQ much, but you can always learn more and wisdom comes with experience.<br>  <br>  Also the whole we don't use all of our brain is not necessarily true, much of your brain is grey matter, or mylination, which is kinda like insulation (like the rubber they coat wires with, otherwize the electric signal won't travel very fast) so all of you neurons are mylinated (coated) and that takes up a great deal of brain matter. when this mylination starts to break down, like with people who suffer from MS, neural signals slow down and misfire, causing all kinds of physical and mental problems (motor control).<br>  <br>  Also, during childhood and the teens something called 'synaptic pruning' happens wherein after your neural pathways have been established the brain 'prunes' unneeded pathways, kinda like how in the whole of the Canadian Rockies there is only a few places you can actually build a highway, no point in building them anywhere else. <br>  <br>  And finally consider all of the automatic actions of your body, your breathing, heartbeat, digestion, other organs, the hormones and regulating chemicals. Your brain is on autopilot for those things, but controlling those functions probably takes up a good portion of brainware.|`|viMAqdxxaa	Be creative , be imaginative , dream lots , exercise mental arithmetic , exercise memory .

BhumxInEaa	Which countries? What makes you assume they are? In response to the current economic crisis, many seem to be moving the other way. Governments around the world are getting more involved with their economy, not less. And the fact that the U.S., long seen as the proponent of extreme free markets, is subsidizing banks and insurance companies is not going unnoticed.<br>  <br>  The one possible exception is China. It started reforming its economy when Mao died and has kept going:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_reform_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_re...</a><br>  and as a result of those reforms, has seen double digit economic growth until last year.

7ciw1aCXaa	The term computer was first applied to professional calculators, people who would carry out long, repeated mathematical calculations. How else did banking get done before electronics? Makes me laugh when someone is described as a human computer - I always think of a Samuel Peyps type with a quill.<br>  <br>  Your brain does not use binary storage, so the term Megabytes cannot be applied. There are thought to be three types of memory, based on protein/structural changes, chemical transmitters/synaptic changes and electrical/cyclical firing changes. The process of engram creation (making a memory) is considered to be as a result of integration of signals from multiple sources - salient (important, tangible, strong, relevant) signals activate patterns of activity, and once a pattern has occurred, the same pattern is more likely to occur again, a bit like a marble wearing a groove in some plasticine.<br>  <br>  The question of storage capacity is unknown and can be affected by the efficiency of the engram creating process, some memories are strong, others are weak. <br>  <br>  The brain is not a digital system, although there are "digital" processes within it (will an axon fire or not) although more credence is now being given to the idea that the analogue part of a neuron, the cell body and the dendrites, are capable of more than just simple analogue processing and can "back-modulate" their own input signals.<br>  <br>  Why not go into neuroscience, if it interests you?|`|jTh0Vf7saa	In bytes, it is believed that the information contained in a single cell is 125,000,000 bytes.

DT6QFP7Yaa	25-27 is the reasonable / good / suitable age for man to marry.However,in India ,many people get their children married at early age.Even child marriage is in vogue in some parts of the country,even though it is illegal.After 2-3 years of marriage or the time suitable for both the partners is usually considered suitable for giving birth to a child after marriage.Some people ,because of job requirements ,prefer child after 2-3 years of marriage.While others want child immediately after marriage.So,the ideal age for marriage is 25-27 for men  n for child,differs from person to person n from family to family.

All women, feminists or not, think that if the world were ruled by women, it would be some kind of utopia. In which case wouldn't, through history, the female dominated cultures have come out on top? Instead of dieing out (or not existing in the first place)|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Inferiority of women has more to do of abusing the weak (physically) in order to gain power and control over someone.  In many Native American tribes, my ancestors and many others in Latina America, the women were the dominant figures.  Women were considered to be stronger and wiser than men because of childbirth and how we connected with the "gods" because of giving life etc.  We were looked as equals and even carried positions of power such as chief etc.  When the Spanish entered Puerto Rico for example and saw that the women where fighting, and equal to their male opposite, they were outraged and told that it was not suppose to be like this.  In Brazil when the Portuguese arrived, they were greated by an army of women.  This too was not the norm for the portuguese and Europe and stopped this behavior to fit the European norms.  .|`|wRLidVqkaa	Read up on some Pagan religions, also the dead sea scrolls; you need to know some history before you start mouthing off.<br>  <br>  Edit: Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle, women aren't Scientists, inventors and explorers? Read some Plato and his thoughts on womens roles! Have you been to Sweden, Germany, Yugoslavia, Australia, the UK; you know what freaks me out? The only place this seems to still be a problem (in the western world) is America. It's mass consumerism, mass globalisation, mass hysteria and mass production! No wonder why they can’t differentiate between people’s characteristics when every sitcom is the same and on every corner is a fast food joint. <br>  <br>  It’s like they the only reality they know is getting their McMansion on Long Island in the typical American dream scenario. Picket fence, comfortable middle class, two car garage wife two kids and a puppy. <br>  <br>  With the trusty old picture of that other great American Ronald Regan and his revolutionary book of America sitting right there in front of their mass media system. This is not how the rest of the world live, this is not how every Country operates and I think it might be about time that you actually looked outside the box.<br>  <br>  Also here are some parts in the world where women are in control: Togo, Central Africa, India, New Zeland, Philippines; there is much more to the world than your tiny little perspective remember that.|`|eCofouDJaa	Personally, I think that men have the desire to be leaders in a much stronger way than women do. And many men still think that a man's weak if he isn't the leader of something. This, when you notice that most, though not all, women lack the need to be at the top of the pile, it's easy to see why men would see them as lesser people for this lack of drive.<br>  <br>  You have to remember that men and women are different. But these differences are like 1+3 and 2+2. They still equal 4, meaning that people overall are still people. Different genders don't mean people aren't people.<br>  <br>  I'd also like to point out that woman, educated, intelligent women, would never say women are inferior to men, just as educated, intelligent men would never go on a feminist rant about superior women. You'll always consider your own gender as 'better' on some level because you understand it.|`|Txr5PvXgaa	Many corporate surveys show that women managers are preferable because they work harder, longer, are sensitive to inequities particularly racial and sexual discrimination in the workplace.  Many of our top female corporate execs are single or childless because they don't have the natural suppport system that male execs come to expect. <br>  <br>  Your supposition is not based in fact as there are many matriarchal societies in the world. Try taking a course in Anthropology. <br>  <br>  Men that purport that they are superior to women usually have "mother issues" and are not found in top political & corporate echelons. There are exceptions as in the case of religious orgs. that limit competition by excluding women and minorities.|`|GR5ZUZQkaa	It's human nature to establish dominance. Men are particularly more aggressive and more commonly strive for dominance.<br>  <br>  The important thing to remember is that just because it happened naturally doesn't mean it's right (at least by today's standards.)<br>  <br>  Racism has also happened all over the world in isolated regions--it's human nature.<br>  <br>  Some would say we as humans have a duty to overcome our "weaknesses."|`|8OREBeRdaa	I think there was communication of a sort but no in the "billboard" format (i.e. big signs saying "Women are lesser than Men") but media has a lot to do with it.  There are other factors that perpetuate this - religion, travel, government, fashion, advertising.  I just think the conclusion came up because it was the predominant thought process.  And when there were challenges made to that norm, they get quelled.<br>  <br>  Now, my view is that just because the world came to a conclusion doesn't mean it's the RIGHT conclusion.  I don't think that women are lesser at all.  As Billy Connolly once said "Men are wonderful things.  Women are wonderful things.  We're just not the @#$%ing same! We're equal! Just not the same! How is that so hard to figure out?!"|`|rgPmkqwXaa	Probably because men have always been wary and scared even of women (they're the propagators of life...), but keep in mind that this male superiority thing is a quite recent development, let's say no older than 3000 or 4000 yrs...before that all religions were centered around women, nature and fertility......it's the Jews (and all other major religions that followed after them) who came up with this notion of a fierce, vengeful, male god.....|`|wSqOwWlVaa	All the more reason we need feminism.  Is it also a co-incidence that almost every single one of these cultures was ruled by men?  Why should women go around being told they're inferior?  Hurrah for modern society, that's all I can say  :-)|`|3ggolLgQaa	EDIT*******<br>  <br>  You are so ignorant!<br>  The reason for this is not because its "true" its because men are physically stronger than women so obviously they dominate women. Also humans hadn't created contraception yet so women were always pregnant therefore vulnerable and not able to do anything. But TODAY we have contraception and we live in a world where the manipulation of information is everything. It doesn't matter that men are stronger than women. We have intelligance, laws and the ability to plan most things.|`|klRvguajaa	The reason that women have been considered inferior in almost every society on earth, before such societies could communicate with each other, and irrespective of intangibles such as climate, social organization, technological advancement, etc., is because women are in fact inferior to men.<br>  <br>  One need only consider two other pieces of evidence to know that this is true.<br>  <br>  First, though women have been given preferential treatment for the last 30+ years in a stated attempt to establish "equality," women have failed to make any significant dent in the realm of accomplishment.  Women still do not make great discoveries (with rare exceptions), they do not become CEOs (with rare exceptions - and generally with horrific results, ask Hewlitt-Packard), they are not becoming attorneys, or doctors, or architects, or engineers, or any of the things that we were once told that they could do, and if they do become such, they eventually give it all up to sit at home, eat bon-bons, watch Oprah, and warble about how being a mother suits them better than working in the high stress environment of the Emergency Room or the Courtroom.<br>  <br>  Which is, of course, what those of us with sense were trying to tell them all along.<br>  <br>  Secondly, note that women - including women's rights organizations - continue to maintain that, in order for women to "achieve proper representation" in certain employment, leadership, or monetary categories, governmental action is necessary.<br>  <br>  In other words, women are equal to men, except that women need the threat of governmental force to allow them to do what men have already been doing on their own for centuries.<br>  <br>  The actual goals of feminism - getting preferential treatment for women by using governmental mandates backed up by the threat of governmental force - betrays that feminists do not really believe their stated philosophy - that women are just as capable as men.  If women were just as capable as men, of course, all that would be necessary for women to achieve equality would be for government to back off and let the markets take their toll, boosting talented women to the same level as it now boosts talented men.  Only if there are no talented women (at least as talented as men) should it be necessary to compel equality with governmental force.<br>  <br>  So I would add to your question this:<br>  <br>  Why is it that human societies for millions of years, plus modern feminists, consider women to be inferior to men?
cN8jCoBUaa	The passage says " the thoughts are important more than the acts them selves." <br>  <br>  <br>  No. how you act is equally or maybe more important.  Your behavior and actions are what actually have the effects on others thus on society.<br>  <br>  In other words, you have to act accordingly to what society deems justifiable and acceptable disregarding whether people or you think your intention is good or bad. SImply, because what matters is how you carry it out and I am pretty sure there are boundaries to what determines what can or will hurt others.|`|huRoNTuEaa	video record it! make sure its set to record in HD so you can get that cinema effect while watching yourself be an asshole
cN8jCoBUaa	Hi , <br>  <br>  To address your question, I personally think working 12 hours a day is  abit too much, and furthermore considering the extra 2 hours of travel that you have to take up. <br>  <br>  But to answer your last question "i just wanna know what i can do to help me get more energetic and passionate at work. so help plz?"<br>  <br>  You will have to sleep more or else you will not have enough energy to perform your best at work. As for how to be more passionate at work, you have to actually like the work. If you don't like the work in the first place, I don't really know how you are going to become passionate now.<br>  <br>  After a second thought last night, I think you can ask yourselves a 1 particular question.<br>  <br>  Why did you get the job in the first place. Was it for money, work experience, hobby or what?<br>  Once you figure that out, then ask yourself if that is still the case. If so, then ask yourself do you still want to achieve that goal, and if it is worth working 12 hours a day for it.

HlxjmFh0aa	That would depend upon the branch of anthropology one was talking about.  Naturally Biblical or cultural anthropology would have to be concerned with epistemology.  Other branches rely heavily on science, but anthropology is a science of discovery &  interpretation so one often finds several possible meanings to a new discovery... therefore differing hypothesis are developed & debated until further evidence is discovered that supports one view or the other. <br>  Unfortunately or fortunately (depending on one's epistomology) anthropology will never be an exacting science such as engineering.
lg8VWo7daa	Vuol dire che a volte diamo delle cose a delle persone che poi non sanno gestire e vengono travolte. Come in amore. Dobbiamo dare si ma non dare per scontato che loro possano riuscire a ricevere tutto ciò che noi gli diamo. Semplicemente dobbiamo dare e far capire o insegnare come ricevere, ma a volte questo per noi può essere un peso e non capiamo perchè siamo egoisti e giudichiamo.

0uSPPAb5aa	People are cruel ! You are not deformed that, I can see. Stop being so hard on yourself ,you will find people who are beyond such immature name calling. You look way to young to call it quits . Keeping yourself in the house will only reinforce what people have said . You need to find other places to go instead of hiding .If you can't you should seek the help of a Professional .Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and only skin deep its whats inside that matters. Honestly I see nothing wrong with the way you look , I willing to bet that the people that said these things are the ones who have problems thinking they are so wonderful . This quality is very ugly just remember what goes around comes around.By verbally attacking you it makes them feel better and others follow suit because they want to fit in with the crowd ! I hope you get some help for this because you are still letting these people run and ruin your life.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	I think you're pretty! You have great hair and really nice skin. :)
c88c855cc85bd59bc479049b9e3848ccaa	You typically need a masters degree in counseling.  The good news is that most masters degree programs in counseling do not care what major you had for your bachelors degree.  This means that in college, you could explore the idea of being a math teacher by majoring in math or education (or however they typically do it where at your college), while taking some counseling or psychology courses to see what that's like. Then you'd be in a position to start teaching, get your masters, or teach for a while and then get your masters in counseling ... depending on how you felt then.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll get so into the math that you'll decide to become a mathematician.  This is in large part what college is for.  Keep your options open.  Good luck.|`|dee77082553fb58cc65a3bc32c4ac9b8aa	you can do anything you want to do but it needs to be something you're going to enjoy. if math is your passion then go for that because teachers can be great counselors too. you can be the best advise giver to your students. i remember in high school i didn't want to talk to my counselor, i felt like she generalized me with other troubled teens so i talked to my chorus teacher and she helped me get through so much. your major would mainly be psychology but you'll wanna minor in things like child psychology or sociology to assit you with children. also child development could look really nice on a resume if you decide to counsel, or even if you major in math a social science could really be benefit to you. good luck in your decision!|`|7352a73376437e6467deb80c358a5309aa	You would need to have at least a masters degree in psychology or social work, both of which take 2 years after you graduate from college. <br>  <br>  to be a good counselor, however, you really have to want it. it takes a LOT of empathy and patience. if this is what you want, then go for it - it's a great field. but if you think that you have more of an interest in being a math teacher than that's also a good field which you might want to explore. <br>  <br>  combining the two, however, may be difficult

She was un-equipped to deal with the masculine testosterone of a teen-aged boy and she was in fact the victim.  Boys and men are predators to women and girls and should be judged accordingly.

And what about Pamela Smart?  Get a grip dude<br>  <br>  <br>  Okay, the fact that you just forced me to use the word 'dude' in a sentence should be punishable by atleast 30 hours of community service.|`|AA10260790	We have to be honest about this issue.  The fact is that there is a difference between the trauma experienced by male victims and female victims.  It's important to get down to the nitty gritty and not pretend that we aren't aware of this.  The reason that it's important is because people will go to prison unjustly all because we refuse to admit what we all know to be true.  If a good-looking female teacher wants to have sex with a 15, 16 or 17 year old male, then this male student is probably going to be willing.  Yes, it makes a difference if the female teacher is good-looking and we all know that.  What men among you wouldn't be overjoyed if a hot female teacher wanted to have sex with you *especially* when you were 15, 16 or 17?  Come on now, let's drop the charade.  In case any of you haven't figured it out, there are differences between men and women.|`|66tTuuIFaa	I just want to point out something in the first article. It says the teacher was "emotionally ill-equipped to deal with the attention of the student."<br>  If you are working in a high school setting and you have not been properly trained and made aware that it's more than likely one young person will have a crush on you then you should have never been hired and you should reconsider a new job.<br>  Emotionally ill-equipped my ***. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your right, in this instance it's clearly not fair that the teacher got completely different punishments. I think part of this comes from the archaic thinking that men or rather boys always want sex, need to get sex and will always enjoy sex no matter how it's with. Whereas girls supposedly never want, enjoy or seek sex so anything sexual activity must have been coerced. This brand of thinking has been around for hundreds of years and it's quite pathetic. <br>  <br>  Whether or not both minors consented, the teachers in question broke more than one law and rightfully they should pay for their crimes. The fact that the female teacher got nothing more than a slap on the wrist is a miscarriage of justice.<br>  Thankfully I don't see this happening too often but unfortunately I see this happen more than I'd like.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	It is indeed very, very rare female figures of authority take legal responsibilty for their actions, especially of this nature. In fact, I recall one case where a 34 year old woman had a sexual relationship with a FOUR year old boy - she accused HIM of seducing her.<br>  <br>  I also remember reading a few feminist articles where these teachers are said to be 'misguided, looking for love' etc. not once are they called as they as are - paedophiles.<br>  <br>  Yes, double standards - yet again.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	It's one of those ridiculous double standards that real feminists should be fighting against.  If you commit a crime, you should be punished in a certain manner, regardless of age or sex.  As for Mary Kay La-whatever, that is one of the very few cases in which a woman has gotten any real punishment for sleeping with a student.  Every case should be like that, for both genders.|`|wRLidVqkaa	It’s nauseating! They should get sent to jail and they should know better! They are adults and they are taking advantage of children! I don’t care what anyone else say’s, these kids might think it’s “cool” now but the adult should never take advantage of them; their hormones are working overtime and they are growing. <br>  <br>  It’s like what Bill O’Reilly said about that little 11 year old boy, that he asked to be raped because he didn’t try to escape! NO the adults should know better than to usurp a child! I would love to see those women and anyone else who does this to children in jail. But what can we do?|`|AA11837835	This is a really dumb question.<br>  I would have loved to have my beautiful second grade teacher fondle me at any age.<br>  I was deeply in love with my sophomore teacher and would have loved for her to take advantage of me.

Laturno went to jail, twice!  Not all women get off with a slap on the wrist.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	I totally agree. <br>  <br>  Btw I think its a joke to put all the responsibility on the teacher. Feminist Julie Burchill (not known for siding with men) once said that any heterosexual man is going to have a hard time fending off the full on attention of a 16 year old girl who could pass for a model. I don't care what anyone says about 'teacher training' - men are biologically geared to respond sexually, and the fact that mostly they don't is an achievement. Similarly the fact that some poor slob is targeted at a vulnerable time in his life e.g. divorce when his defences are weak shouldn't mean he gets slung in jail while the girl who initated it gets the full 'victim status' award. <br>  <br>  Then again many feminists will NEVER know what it is like to have sexual power over a man - this is probably why a lot of them become feminists in the first place.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  "Feminists demand equality except when it comes to accountability"<br>  Amen, brother.|`|3ggolLgQaa	Yes! This was on my mind a few months ago!<br>  <br>  What a double standard! I think its disgusting and it makes no difference what those articles say. To me they are still pedophiles and they are sick in the head!<br>  <br>  I don't think it has anything to do with feminism though!<br>  (Maybe some dellusional feminists) <br>  If anything, a feminist would be Pee'd off at the laws and media making it seem as though the woman is SO vulnerable and stupid that even with a small child, she has no responsibility over what she does just because its a "he" that she is dealing with.|`|0rbOTv15aa	sexism its true a young boy would probably enjoy having sex with his teacher but the same can be said for a young girl|`|4jUqOBWZaa	Feminists have been very successful in using the natural instincts of Men to protect women to their advantage. Feminists demand equality except when it comes to accountability. Then they want privilege, or to put it another way they want to promote the concept that a Woman or Women who commit horrific crimes are damaged not evil. Men who commit horrific crimes are fully accountable and get justice not mercy. In truth it means Women are children mentally who must be protected from their own bad choices and are never accountable. <br>  <br>  This does Women a disservice by making them less accountable. And it panders to their worst instincts. We have seen more Female Violence. The Ladette culture in the UK shows a 300% increase in violence in less than a decade. More horrific and violent crimes being committed by Women. Women who resort to violence to resolve their issues. <br>  <br>  We are seeing Mothers commit serial murder of their Children in the US now on a regular basis. Women who microwave their babies, chop off their arms of their toddlers, bash in the Skulls of their Sons, Drown their children in SF Bay, and their bathtubs. Even chasing them to kill them. The wheels are off with our Women, because we give sympathy to monstrously evil crimes committed by Women. <br>  <br>  We even justify the murder of Spouses by Women now. Mark Winkler is a recent example. Or the mother who strangled her daughter to preserve a relationship with a Beau. Susan Smith who murdered her two sons, to save a relationship. <br>  <br>  And the sexual abuse of Minor Male Students now in the hundreds by Female Teachers, many of them Mothers and married.

V48inFxWaa	There are two possible meanings of the word.<br>  <br>  One means that society is investing considerably more resources into those individuals who have shown some extraordinary ability or talent in order to develop them as much as possible. But the access to the group is based only on talent and abilities.<br>  <br>  The other means the existence of a relatively closed circle formed on a basis of wealth, nationality, religion or race that is treated considerably better than the rest of society. Since it is based on birth, there is practically no mobility between this circle and the rest of society.<br>  <br>  The first approach was utilized in searching and developing sports talents in former Eastern Europe and proved itself quite successful.  But be it in sport or in science and education, it can only work if it has a basis in relatively high quality and widespread sports activity or educational service for all. If it is underpinned by a weak or  low quality service for all, it can  not fix the original mistake of poor recruiting. Research has shown that countries with the highest average quality of schools produce more added value per capita than those with the highest quality of the best school.<br>  <br>  The second approach is downright damaging as it poures resources on a small pre-determined elite among which are stupid and lazy ones and denies high quality of education to non-elite ones with potentials.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	obviously, more elites(high profile tech intelligence genius person) you have, more productive the society will be.

Just trust yourself.. Watch that Movie called "The secret" it tells a lot about self confidence, how successful people thought of themselves as they can do impossible things, and they really did. know Einstein, was always called a fool in his school, but he was way too cool. and similar with other great people. :) Just look at yourself in the mirror and know, that its your true self, you have control on your body and can do whatever you want, its the only opportunity you have, don't miss it, in thinking you cannot do it. To do anything, the first step is always difficult, but once taken, other steps appear themselves, so when you are not taken the first thinking, if the first step is so hard, how will i go through other steps, know that only the first step is hard in doing anything.. Other steps are a lot easier.. <br>  <br>  Hope it will help.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  <br>  And Even if you do dumb, let it happen, why you give a damn about other people?? They are not gonna die with you.. so just do what you want, don't break Laws. But do things you want under Laws, and if you say nonsense, just tell yourself, i tried.. and it doesn't matter what other thinks, if you carry a baby on hands or cart, they will still criticize, because that's what people know to do.. Do as you like it, because, you do it the right way, and read books about things.. what so ever..

6pTIspQlaa	I agree with answer # 2.  I have found that any struggle that you encounter is actually a teacher. These teachers are there to help you. Even though you have feelings of frustration towards said experiences. This is a sign that you have a chance to grow. Now, this takes a little faith. But once you go through it and see it works, it gets easier every time(because of the knowledge of knowing why you are going through this process). These experiences can be humbling, so you really have to let go. And allow the experience to run its course. A sign that you know you are failing in a certain experience generally has these traits: Controlling!!!  Self doubt, followed by self destructive behavior!  Manipulations!  Denial! Co-Dependency! And one of the worst you can do " Lying to Yourself".  <br>  I think you get the point though. A lot of Negative behavior. The only way you can change your situations, is by changing yourself. As soon as you start to learn to control yourself, everything else follows.|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	I deal with frustrations as a learning experience in life. I try to see what I have learned as a result of that particular experience. What does not kill me only makes me stronger as a result. <br>  <br>  Going to church since I was a kid reinforces those views as an adult. Don't just look at the situation, but know that at the end of every frown, or tear, a smile is not far behind. Worrying is like a rocking chair, it keeps you busy but gets you nowhere. That is a motto that I tend to live by, because it's so true.|`|854xeaRvaa	don't dwell on them, experience new things to push them down from consciousness. make sure you feed yourself with positivity to override the negativity you learned.. this is life , everyone experiences horrible things , what do we say about people who live in wars , have seen their parents or children shot dead with a pleading look in their eyes, those who have terminal cancers and count their running days.. believe me stranger you are lucky , you are very lucky.. take it from me though young i have matured very quickly and came to appreciate everything i have maintaing an upper status over my experience with a meaning i super-impose and inject here and there , do that no matter how excruciatingly painful your life is and you will live in peace and purpose.. it all boils down to meaning and is a voluntary choice

The only person you're really trying to impress and prove anything to is yourself. There are other ways of getting yourself noticed than being a bully.<br>  <br>  I don't believe you really care if it's "good" or "bad".

As Squall said, fear should exist on some level for your own self preservation.  <br>  <br>  On a more applicable note though, I would try to get yourself in check at those times.  At your current situation it feels like you are just establishing your dominance.  But dominance is no longer simply about physical prowess.  Its one thing you fight a person, and they hit you, it doens't fade you and they run off or you clobber them, but what if next time that person brings a knife.  On the other hand, you may find yourself in a situation with a more clever person who knows your aggressive characteristics, and that person can lead you easily into a trap of some sort.  Have you ever been jumped?

It's actually a pretty radical psychological defense. What you're describing is the polar opposite of someone who is dramatically introverted.<br>  <br>  Without knowing you, I suspect your behavior is actually, ironically, pointing to a self-confidence issue requiring you to prove yourself constantly. Again, same core issue as someone who is insanely shy and introverted, just a competely opposite way of handling.<br>  <br>  Fear is a good thing. It keeps a sane (wo)man from doing things that are obviously lethally stupid (like jumping from a plane). Similar to someone with too high of a pain tolerance, by shutting off a vital human function you are actually training your instinctive warning system to not operate the way it's meant to which could eventually (and likely will) get you killed. Just as someone who's pain tolerance is abnormally high might not recognize a heart attack; in an extreme example, what you do is like someone trying to stop a wrecking ball.

If you don't care about people then that is the way you are... Are you on any sort of medication for your other problems? Have you spoken to your psychiatrist about this?

X94VKR0Laa	what a stupid thing to say!|`|27ca791e37b603a94b96a9f5e401b245aa	One could say so, yes although the biologists say homosexuality occurs even amongst other living creatures, humans are by no mean an exception !|`|854xeaRvaa	possibly|`|wKbEKg0Paa	Homosexuality has been around since the early part of human civilization. The Bible makes references to occurrences of it. The ancient Greeks practiced it also. Even before any population boom, there has been homosexuality. I doubt it that homosexuality is an evolutionary response to overpopulation. In fact, homosexuality can occur in places where there is scarcity of women. That's precisely why the navy has been the butt of homosexuality jokes. Somewhere in the Middle East, I was told that there have been instances of straight males turning homosexual. Apparently, the lack of women combined with intense sexual cravings can turn straight male into homosexuals.|`|qPj7p6D1aa	Your observation of the current crises of our existing planet domination is very interesting. Homosexuality is in our today's world a learned process and not a instinctual drive like in animals. WE humans have a moralistic foundation of which the majority has ruled to be evident in the recovery of substantial rewards . There is an area in the tropics of asia or nearby of which the male gender is traditionally told to have oral sex with a male elder outside his immediate family to show his integrity in sustaining a monogamous relationship with his wife.|`|a1VK1L64aa	Yes, it is one of many factors. I state this after working on a chicken farm that was very crowded and personally viewing the high rate of homosexuality exhibited by the rosters.<br>  <br>  There is also the social acceptance of this practice that has evolved with the increasing earths population.|`|sibfHKVkaa	I haven't seen the film, but I don't think anyone could support this assumption in the main question with any facts. You may be able to prove homosexuality is a response to the absence of the opposite sex, or that homosexuality can be a factor in a drop of the rate of population growth for a number of reasons.  I think you would have an easier time proving that homosexuality is a factor in the slow down of population rate.<br>  <br>  There are many arguments that contradict your argument. Why would overpopulation cause homosexuality? Would an individual be that concerned about the increasing population rate that the concern of certain doom would evoke homosexuality in the individual? <br>  <br>  There have been many documented cases of homosexuality throughout history and even in ancient times. So it can't have evolved, if it has always been present. It would be more plausible to attribute homosexuality or the increase thereof, to a decay in the morals of society. <br>  <br>  The genetic aspect:<br>  <br>   If homosexuality is genetic then how will it be passed on unless a homosexual has offspring? If it was a genetic trait then eventually the gene would disappear. If the gene doesn't disappear it means homosexuals are having offspring annyway which again contradicts your assumption that the gene could control population. <br>  <br>  Then the last bit of info you give about exponential growth. From biology class I remember a bit on exponential models on bacteria. Although we are far from bacteria we are still life as bacteria. In the bacteria model, bacteria grow and reproduce exponentially (and much faster than humans because they split in half and nobody has to pay for dinner). When the food source is gone many die off, but few do survive and they start to grow exponentially again. I am sure there are human population growth models also and I would be interested in these also if you are trying to back any arguments. <br>  <br>  Although I disagree with the assumption, it has elements of originality. However, as you see I have either offered some facts to the contrary or at least ideas that are contradictory to your assumptions. <br>  If you can offer one fact to back up anything you assume, please add, otherwise, the answer to this question has to be no.|`|DoqcfkyLaa	no.|`|AA11711847	I've had these same thoughts and the main problem with this is that there is no "gay" gene.  However, i believe that the physical evolution of humans ceased some time ago.  Humans have no need or ability (in a traditional evolutionary sense) to further evolve physically because we can adapt traits from any species by making tools.  Additionally, we no longer have to adapt to the environment because we can adapt the environment to us to make it sustainable in an increasing number of cases.  With that in mind, I think that human evolution happens now on an social and cultural level on an individual basis.  Evolution is not about whats best, but rather what works.  So socially people do what works for them.  I have dismissed the idea in my mind that it is a mechanism for population control because with evolution there is no person pulling the strings giving us adaptations that will help us in the future.  There is also no "groupthink" aspect to traditional evolution.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, i have mused about social and cultural evolution as well as cognitive evolution and while it wouldn't work as a mechanism for population control (since populations fall under traditional evolution) it could certainly be considered a way of making people productive members of society that otherwise would be outcast.

HYzJ5lKqaa	Current account surplus is when an economy exports more than imports. (more money in than out).<br>  <br>  Current account deficit is when an economy imports more than exports. (more money going out than in).<br>  <br>  So to think about AD and its measure on an economy's GDP, you have to consider that during a CA surplus, more money is earned rather than spent, and during a CA deficit, more money is spent rather than earned.<br>  <br>  So on a AD-AS model, during CA surplus, the AD curve shifts higher along the AS curve, uptrending along the price-line and output-line. During CA deficit, its the reverse in effect, sliding down the AS curve to trail higher prices and lower supply output.|`|9ItP8k2haa	The Current Account is part of the Balance of Payments which is a record of the transactions between one country and another. There are four components on the Current Account. <br>  1) Trade of Goods <br>  2) Trade of Services<br>  3) Net Investment Income<br>  4) Transfers<br>  <br>  The first two are the main components of the Current Account. Trade in goods and services together is the exports and imports of a country. <br>  <br>  Aggregate Demand is made up of four components:<br>  <br>  AD= C+I+G+(X-M)<br>  <br>  C-Consumption<br>  I-Investment<br>  G-Government Spending<br>  X-Exports <br>  M- Imports<br>  <br>  Ideally, the economy wants equilibrium; for X=M. This means that there is the same amount of exports and imports. However, there are two situations that countries experience; X>M -trade surplus and <br>  X<M -trade deficit. <br>  <br>  A trade surplus would mean that AD would increase because there are more exports than imports and the opposite will happen for a deficit.<br>  <br>  NB- if there are more imports than exports (deficit) then the current account will be negative so the effect on AD will be negative.<br>  <br>  However there are evaluation points, <br>  <br>  A deficit may not be immediately bad because consumption may increase with more imports and this is more significant than the current account. (Consumption makes up 65% of AD)<br>  <br>  It also depends on how dependent a country is on exports or imports. <br>  For example, the UK is quite dependent on imports. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you! :)

AA12299134	Have you been feeling overwhelmed by things lately?  This could be what the glass shards symbolise; little things which are coming from nowhere to happen in your life (seemingly falling from the sky) and are causing you discomfort, like sharp glass which can cut you.<br>  <br>  Glass is also see-through and is often invisible.  Sometimes our fears and worries may be very subconscious as to be almost invisible to us or our conscious awareness.  We are not sure where the worries and fears come from, but they are still with us on some level.|`|yeSeoIbjaa	a change in your condition of life.|`|FXaHv4lgaa	Glass shards cut, and are dangerous, and come from something that was once whole and is now broken.  It would be a metaphor for your life - you are deluged by small things or one major issue that is hurting you, something you wanted to be whole but is shattered beyond repair and now a pain or even a danger to you. Beyond that, hard to say.  It could be just a present situation, but as with most emotional metaphor dreams, is probably a present situation that touches off feelings from the past.  The glass shards definitely represent negative feelings you have towards some situation (work love life, school, family)  you have ongoing.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Only you can answer this.  Everyone has a slightly different idea of what things mean, so no one else can tell you for sure, although some charlatans will try.<br>  <br>  You need to do free association: think of the idea of glass shards, and see what related ideas come up.  Then, see if those related ideas relate to anything you're struggling with (or enjoying) lately.  If not, take those related ideas, and free associate with them in the same way.<br>  <br>  For example, if I think of fires, I also think of cold rainy nights, heat, the soft glow of flickering light in a room -- mostly comfort despite problems (the rain outside), really.  I might associate that gentle comfort with with a girlfriend, with home, or with security.  If I'd also been dreaming about that fire going out, I might be afraid of losing my girlfriend or my home.  It takes a little time, and requires some self control and some self-knowledge, but the process of analysing your own dreams is pretty easy really.<br>  <br>  Just remember that not every dream will make sense to the waking mind, and if you really have to guess what a symbol means despite filling your mind with it and asking what it associates with, then it's probably just a random image that isn't very important to you.  If you clutch at straws and try to make up something that it means, you'll only mislead yourself.  Better to just forget it in that case.|`|qPj7p6D1aa	We're talking plainly about dreams, and these have a symbolic meaning nonetheless. Sigmund Freud a great scientist whom developed the dream interpretation theory of which I and a thousand other mental health counselors use, may agree the glass shards are probably a crystal clear message the male gender has a certain amount of authority in your life and time is of an essence. There must be more information concerning your life if you desire a broader perspective in analysis.|`|xuDGrCSVaa	Is your environment hostile toward you...OR are you making someone else's environment hostile for them...maybe by words or deeds.   Sometimes words and deeds can cut and hurt you, when they are suppose to be gentle like rain.

You can access PsychINFO via your school's website, which bypasses any need to register or pay for the subscription. Once you're on PsychINFO.com (or <a href="http://www.apa.org/psycinfo/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/psycinfo/)</a> search for the terms "cognitive" and "behavioral." Look for anything written by Aaron Beck, Albert Ellis, or both.<br>  <br>  There are WAY too many studies to give you just one to suit your purposes. If you don't want to read the whole thing (and it sounds like you don't) then just read the abstract at the beginning.

b1633073cbe7241354a56b43894a2617aa	Research is either quantitative or qualitative. Independent and dependent variables are statistical terms. Variables are not defined within a survey. Data is collected through some psychometric means (which might include a survey, of sorts) and referred to as variables when included in quantitative research statistical analyses. <br>  <br>  Qualitative research can also rely on surveys, but information obtained via these means is not typically referred to as variables. Surveys are simply a means to obtain information, be it qualitative information or quantitative information. <br>  <br>  Note to the one of the above answerers: correlational studies are not surveys, nor are they self-report measures. Correlation is a type of data analysis technique. Results obtained imply a relationship exists but it isn't a causal one.|`|163e034b9d3f96f263c1b57eae8e6e14aa	I would say most likely not since a survey is more of a correlational study rather than an experimental study which does have dependent and independent variables. A correlational study doesn't have independent and dependent variables because it is a self-reported measure, and with a self-report it's difficult to determine if one thing caused another thing unlike experimental studies.

c4710a4fabf3b7e82cea7f20dc68f2d3aa	1960's economy in United States (I'm assuming your talking about the US) was a Keynesian economy. There was an active government policy to respond to inflationary and recessionary gaps. In this era of new liberalism and social democracy, US and most of the western world enjoyed low, stable unemployment and modest inflation. That is until the stagflation in the 1970's that threw our economy into a dump and the Keynesian policies were replaced with monetarist policies and supply-side policies in the 1980's by president Reagan.|`|bcY7cWXVaa	All i know is that myself and all of our neighbors growing up in a middle class family had one t.v. ,one phone, one family car, we went out maybe once a month to a restaurant and any 20-something person today would think we were dirt poor.<br>   Of course we weren't , but people were able to do the jobs americans wont do today supposedly and everybody seemed to make it okay .
