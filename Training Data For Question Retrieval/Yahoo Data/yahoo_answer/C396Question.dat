20090220033822AAnih6Z	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What is wrong with the thermostat in my apartment?	Now this is just frustrating for me.  The temperature the way I want it would be 72 degrees in the winter.  It now reads 85 degrees and still rising.  I tried everything like turning down the damn thing, turning it off cause it'is too hot in here, yanked the batteries out of it which worked once but it didn't work this time, yanked the thermostat out and take the batteries out.  That also worked once.  I called the landlord and he said he has a new thermostat.  And he sent his own repairman.  He replaced the batteries which I did - it didn't work.  He also put a new set of batteries in it too and left.  The damn heat is still running even I shut it off again!!  Any suggestions or clues that may fix this junk?  I had this thermostat for about 4 years.  I just wanted to flush this stupid thing in the toilet!!  Any suggestions or repair ideas would be very helpful and cool down my apartment.  Thanks!

20090203123519AAJ4Cx6	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Why can't I buy calcium chloride-based ice melter any more?	I live in northwestern CT where winters can be rough. Ice melt is useful but not everything is great for a wooden porch. Most rock-salts (sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride) are extremely abrasive, you may as well tape sandpaper to the bottoms of your shoes while you walk on the porch.      We used to be able to get calcium-chloride based ice melt, which is not as abrasive (it actually is in tiny little white beads which just turn into powder if stepped on).      The calcium-chloride ice melt was always more expensive than others, but until this year, we could always get it. This year, it is available nowhere. I've tried discount stores, home-improvement stores, hardware stores, no one upon no one has a speck of it.      Last year we got it in a huge bag, branded as "Prestone Driveway Heat." Prestone's Web site doesn't mention it, however.      What's more, no one will explain what happened. At a hardware store I used to get it, the guy insisted that what they had was exactly the same stuff, but I know it wasn't. Other places where I'd seen the calcium-based stuff last year, also denied ever having sold it.      Something happened to it. I'd like to know what. Was it banned or something? If not, where can I get it?

I posted this yesterday and didn't get many answers so I thought I would try again this morning. Thinking about buying a house with high levels of radon. The test showed a level around 10. We think the high level is due to the fact the house has been abandoned for a couple months but there is a mitigation system installed. We have turned it on and are going to retest. Even if the system works and reduces the levels below 4 my wife and I are a bit hesitant as we want to use our basement as a playroom for our kids. Anyone out there with a similar situation? Anyone currently live in a house with kids and have a high level of radon but lowered by a mitigation system? We are looking for a little first hand advice. Thanks in advance.

20090220063317AAea1mT	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Room too hot! Furnace problems!?	We have a two-story townhouse w/ two thermostats, one on each floor. This year the furnace is malfunctioning--it's either ON or OFF. If it's turned on, it just keeps pumping hot air through the house, never turns off---which is fine, temperature-wise, on the first floor, but it makes my bedroom on the second floor way too hot! If I try to sleep with my door closed, I'll wake up an hour later, feeling like it's about 90 degrees. Last night, it was so hot, I had to go downstairs and sleep on the couch!      Either thermostat seems to control both floors---last night, only the downstairs thermostat was turned on, but the upstairs one showed the blue emerg. light, and the hot air was flooding into my room, even though it was in the "off" position.      Anyone got any ideas as to what might be wrong? Or tips for me to try? I can't live like this...I need to be able to sleep in my own room. :)

I tried playing with the controls to no avail.  I was concerned that I would have to call an HVAC guy early this morning.  Then it simply kicked back on like 45 minutes later and appears to be working normally.  It is not programmed to turn on and off or change temps.  My question is, "Why did this happen?  Is it possible it got too hot and there is an internal thermostat that shut it off?  It is in the attic and it is much cooler up there so I want to believe it did not overheat.  Your thoughts ? "  Thanks!

I know there is more involved then just sticking them in the ground. And what time of year is best to plant them? If there are any gardeners who want to share their knowledge I would appreciate it! We bought our first house in October after renting for my entire adult life so I am an amateur!

20090220062845AAlEpWF	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	What are causing these stains & how can I get rid of them?!?	After doing laundry at my boyfriend's house, I discovered that several of my shirts ended up with discoloring dark brown (not yellow) stains under the armpits.  However, this only happened to my pink, blue, and peach colored shirts.  NONE of my white shirts were effected.   These shirts have been washed several times before at my house with Arm & Hammer liquid detergent and warm water.  At his house, he uses a powdered detergent with bleach alternative in cold water.    I have also been using the same antiperspirant for years and have never had a problem with stains or sweating.   Any answers will be appreciated.  Thank you!
