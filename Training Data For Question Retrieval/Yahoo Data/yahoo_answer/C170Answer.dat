KOwzDLPdaa	My husband and I both serve full time in the military. We have an 8 year old, a 13 month old and I'm 6 months pregnant.<br>  <br>  We get up at 5am, are out the door at 630am to drop the kids off at daycare for 7am and be at work for 730am....we pick the kids up and are home by 5, cook supper, check homework, clean up from supper, bath and tuck in two kids, (soon to be three!), tidy the house. maybe do a load of laundry and try to be in bed for 10pm so we can get up in the morning and do it all again, assuming neither of us is deployed or away on a training exercise.<br>  <br>  Wow, written out like that, its amazing we had time to make #3!<br>  <br>  It gets wasier and the secret is to make your time with your husband count as much as possible, even if its chatting during the housework or co-showering together to save time and ust have a conversation with no kids around :)<br>  <br>  It gets easier!<br>  <br>  Congrats on your daughter :)|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I have three girls and I went back to work in January. My twins were a month and a half old when I went back to work.  My oldest daughter went to day care and my husband watched the twins. <br>  <br>  I work 3 days a week from 9am-3pm. My husband was not working at all so he was with the girls full time. <br>  <br>  In a week my husband is going back to Iraq for 6-8months and I will still be working. Our oldest will still be going to daycare and our twins will go to either my parents house or my in-laws house.|`|AwvWBROlaa	I am in the same shoes but i dont work yet. I go to school tuesday-friday 11 unites and i have my mom watch her but my husband ( i hate to say this but its hard to trust my husband with the baby haha) I cant imagine going to work anytime soon... tho i have to =(  its going to get pretty hard... its hard enough trying to study bio with a cranky baby... i just wish she would take naps around the time i feel like studying. haha.. it seems to be the opposite most all the time. its sooo tough and i dont have strong motivation like i should. I am trying though... time flys by and if i dont get anything done NOW i am going to regret it later. you know? haha... you are doing a fantastic job and i wish you luck! sometimes it feels like sky is falling down on me.. i am sooo pressured to be a good person for this human being called a child. But it will all be worth it later. no pain no gain=)|`|FHT6wsUpaa	My husband works second shift and I work first. We need child care about 3 times per week, but only for 3-1/2 hours or less. My daughter goes to a day care once or twice a week, and the other days we have a sitter come.<br>  <br>  My husband is the lucky one...he gets to be with her in the morning. She's definitely a morning person, and is sometimes pretty crabby in the evenings. I try not to let it get to me...I know it's nothing I'm doing wrong, she just gets worn down during the day.<br>  <br>  The absolute hardest thing is not getting to spend much time with my husband, or together as a family. My husband doesn't get weekends off all the time like I do...we get about two weekends together every other month. Our schedules are convenient for our daughter, as she's almost always with one of us...but it's not so good for us. We're trying to come up with a plan that will let me stay home in the near future. Right now I'm worth half our income, but we'll see.|`|vjsT8DMIaa	I work full time with 3 little ones. My oldest is almost 6, my middle child is 2, and my baby just turned 3 months yesterday. I worked full time my entire pregnancy, and went back to work when she was 4 weeks old. My husband and I work opposite schedules...he works days, I work evenings....sometimes I wish I could be a SAHM, but I would probably lose my mind!! LOL I get sad some days, but ya know what?? it all comes down to my bills have to get paid, and my children need food in their mouths and clothes on their back. So I work...<br>  oh, and I leave for work at 1pm, husband gets the kids from the sitters at 5:30pm, so they are only there for 4 hours at the most. He feeds them and puts them to bed. I get home around 11pm, go to sleep, get up at night with the baby, and then bathe the kids in the morning and the same the next day...LOL<br>  nothing exciting!! haha but we manage
PbBWJGsTaa	You get it from both parents.<br>  <br>  Each parent has 1 set of genes for blood type, consisting of two different genes.  If youre just talking about ABO blood types, here are the types you can be<br>  <br>  AB (group AB)<br>  AO (group A)<br>  BB (Group B)<br>  BO (Group B)<br>  AA (Group A)<br>  OO (Group O)<br>  <br>  Heres an example:<br>  <br>  Mother is group A (her genes are AO)<br>  Father is group B (his genes are BB)<br>  Baby can be group AB, or group B.<br>  <br>  in the above example, the if the baby was born with group AB, then yes, it would have a different blood type to both it's parents.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	Its a combination. Genetically speaking some blood types are more dominant, so you will get the dominate blood type unless both of your parents passed a recessive gene to you|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I got mine from my grandmother on my mother's side.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I'm o+ and I think my mom is also.
T0pkW783aa	Allyse is a very pretty and feminine name.  I like the nickname Ally.  I am not crazy about the combination of Allyse and Ann; it sounds too awkward.|`|1SqP9KoCaa	it looks nice but it would be a hassel in the future when you have to spell it out everysingle time for people.|`|ej51eWO7aa	allyse love the name<br>  allyse raelynn|`|C55pji5Qaa	I love the name but I do not care for the spelling,some may pronounce it like "Alice".If Ann has a sentimental meaning than use it.Your daughter your choice.|`|AA10972366	Its cute.<br>  If u feel Ann is a filler u should consider a second middle name.<br>  I think it would turn out cute that way!|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Personally I prefer Elise.<br>  <br>  But its your choice at the end of the day.|`|CCyvAXYRaa	sounds your trying to hard to make "alice"<br>  in a more original way.|`|ZCT2mKmaaa	its nice|`|91hxNCfWaa	Allyse is an unusual name, and would probably be mispronounced often. And I don't think Ann fits as a nickname with the name Allyse, personally.<br>  <br>  Ann is a pretty first name though, it's old fashioned :)|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like it a lot, but I would spell it Alysse. That is how the person I knew with this name spelled it.<br>  <br>  My middle name is Ann, after my mom's middle name also, so you should go with it.|`|AA11946005	Pretty names seperately but I'm not fond of the A A combo (or any letter repeated for first and middle, actually).

Yeah, there's one at the mall.|`|zYeBQZB5aa	I do not like this name spelled this way. I think that this spelling is a lot better: Elise. It looks prettier and is a lot less confusing. Either way you spell it, Allyse Ann or Elise Ann doesn't flow well. Do you like Allyse Desiree better? I do.|`|y8HKAhBFaa	Allyse is sorta weird because it would sound like a car dealership person(no Offense) to my opinion i think it would be cute... Allyse Ann. Ann is a cute name and Allyse is just kinda very creative to the mind.|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	I would spell it Alyse, no two Ls, otherwise it looks like "Ally-say", and coming from someone who always has their name pronounced wrong, it's a pain.<br>  <br>  I think it's cute and a different way of spelling. :)|`|TZWkf59Daa	pretty!!<br>  its original!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=24">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  please answer!<br>  we are looking for best answer!|`|1EoTIZl8aa	What does Allyse even mean? Names with meanings seem more affectionate of a parent to name their children with. Sounds like "A Lease" to me. Alice is cute.|`|8lRGGZHOaa	i like it but its spelled kinda weird. people would probably call her alice. maybe try aleece or i dont now.<br>  cute name though :)|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I prefer Allyssa :)<br>  How about.. Annalysse ~ that's gorgeous!!!|`|6hnEhNcQaa	It is a pretty name. <br>  Pros:  It's original spelling and look. <br>  Cons: It sounds like "A Lease", like for a car.|`|ValLVBcYaa	Aww, I love that name!

1IjYMMdhaa	Life is all about heartbreak and struggle. Think of it this way, your at home, you don't have to worry about bills( rent, utilities, food, gas) and you have something a lot of people don't have...a mom. I went through my rebellious stage also not too long ago. I moved out, got an apartment and tried to make it. But really, nothing beats staying at home. <br>  <br>  Your mom may just be frustrated with the situation or from something else. The best thing you can do is try and see where shes coming from and if that doesn't work, agree with whatever she is saying and leave it at that. <br>  <br>  Also, boys(girls if you a boy) come and go. I have had many relationships where I thought it would never be as good as it was, but i'm also proved wrong when I meet someone better. Its just life so you just gotta get use to the situation and deal with it.|`|VXQFT341aa	You need to apologize to your mom. Your making her life miserable. I think your to young to know what stress is. Drama yes, Stress NO.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	just pick yourself up, dust off and start all over again.<br>  try to please your mom, i know its hard but it will make<br>  life alot easier..|`|PExOJJLgaa	take a few deep breathes and remember:<br>  <br>  you're not the first that this has happened to.<br>  everyone gets into arguments with family, its natural,<br>  especially at this age.<br>  there's always a solution to everything.<br>  <br>  about the heart break, obviously it was not meant to be.<br>  you want to give up on everything just because<br>  of a situation with a guy that you probably will forget soon?<br>  <br>  trust meee, being a teenager i hard, i know!<br>  in a few years, these situations will be past you and you<br>  will think about how foolish you were to ever think about<br>  giving up.<br>  <br>  <br>  And besides ALL OF THAT:<br>  <br>  <br>  there are people out the starving that would KILL for your life.|`|8c1543nUaa	Hmmm... it sound like you just being a little drama queen who only cares about herself. Did you ever think maybe you could be making HER life miserable? YOU have too much stress? Where's the dramatic child you have to raise?|`|QjePchibaa	Hey don't give up.  I'm sure it's not the end of the world.  The best thing to do is just sleep on it.  I swear it works.  Then if you still feel awful tomorrow talk to your friends, they tend to make you feel better.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Well thanks to you, she's also having a sh*tty time right now. You should have just told her you needed some space. No need to bring her down, she has feelings too.
P1xlrvAaaa	Well the further along in your pregnancy the less "sickness"type symptoms you are supposed to have.She is correct about not being able to hear babies heartbeat on a doppler until between 10 to 15 weeks.I would just try to relax unless you start to have other BAD symptoms and maybe call your doc in the morning and explain the situation.Good Luck and best wishes!|`|T0pkW783aa	After the first 8 weeks, some of the earlier symptoms seems to subside.  Your breasts adjust to the increases in size and they are not so tender as they were in the beginning.  The early morning sickness also goes away.  You will have the urge to urinate more often as your abdomen gets bigger and you have pressure from the added weight but for now, you are probably fine.  If you are worried about it, call your doctor.  First time Moms get worried when they don't know what to expect.  Call and if he thinks you need to be seen, he will schedule an appointment.  You are probably just fine and going through the normal symptoms of pregnancy.   Try not to worry.  (My daughter-in-law went through the same thing.  She went for her four month checkup and heard the heartbeat that they didn't find the last time . . .  she was so worried.  All is well and she is feeling so much better knowing that things are on target.)  You probably just got scared when your doctor told you what to watch for in the event you were having problems.  That is her job to inform you but first time mothers sometimes get so worried about those symptoms that they start to think they are having them.)|`|NMzlbWt8aa	I went thru the same thing where i stopped getting the symptoms.  Its normal for most peoples symptoms to wear off after a bit, but if youre still really worried, then call you OB and talk with them about it.  Good luck|`|YkX0GZoOaa	It is completely normal for symptoms to come and go. Don't stress about it.
AA11905385	i have my first round of clomid and iui in 2 weeks i'll pray for both of us!!!|`|CbKOO4HFaa	After my hubby and I tried to conceive for over a year, I did two rounds of Clomid and IUI and neither worked.  But the total motile sperm count of the sample they injected was fairly low both times.  I got pregnant several months later on a non-Clomid and non-IUI cycle.  The chances of pregnancy are definitely higher when you do Clomid and IUI.  Good luck to you!!!

1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	A blood test will give you an answer and be much less expensive than an ultrasound. Your doctor should at least be concerned about the missing periods, have you been under unusal stress lately or recently gained or lost a significant amount of weight? Those can be reasons other than pregnancy that you could be missing your periods.
hitgP4Hoaa	well to be honest at 15 i dont think you should be on anything, but as you said your having sex i would be asking your mother to get you on birth control because i think she would be far happier bring to get that then you telling her you were pregnant, your mam knows your not a virgin so i really think you should sit down and have a chat with her. please be careful you are just so young enjoy be young :)|`|UgRJY0wcaa	Talk to your mom and tell her you want to be responsible and prevent a teenage pregnancy.  If she disagrees, you can go to planned parenthood and ask them for some birth control.  They will tell you what you need to do to get on it.  <br>  <br>  When I was a teenager, I was actually put on birth control because I had very painful cramps and this regulated my cycle and made my period less painful.  If you're uncomfortable talking about sex with your mom, you could tell her you heard it will make your period less painful and this is why you want to go on birth control.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and good job being responsible!|`|YYLzML9gaa	You can go to planned parenthood for birth control without your parent's knowledge. If you go to planned parenthood you do not need her consent. But if you want your mother to take you just tell her that your periods are heavy and birth control lightens them :) And BC also makes periods shorter. That should work. good luck! (go to PPHP.ORG)

hIzQyflqaa	I bled a bit after sex once but it is normal apparently! i was so scared but baby was fine! if your worried take it slow next time and dont be too aggressive during sex!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	normal after intercourse or a bm|`|K2jT1z5jaa	while sex happens the cervix gets irritated from the rubbing- due to more blood going around the body and to the cervix. the bleeding occurs. it is normal to have this.<br>  <br>  its really good that you heard bubs heartbeat- baby is strong bubs ;)<br>  and good that you have no cramps.<br>  stay calm darling x & strong - this is normal.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|NMzlbWt8aa	I had the same thing happen early in my pregnancy too.  It can be normal to experience a small bit of blood because the Cervix has become engorged with it.  When the penis bumps into it during sex, this can cause the bleeding. Make sure to mention it at your next appointment.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i had the same problem, its normal to bleed after intercourse and after you do it several times, you wont bleed anymore. as long as you dont bleed for more than 48 hours your safe! dont worry! it'll probably happen after intercourse at least a few more times!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i had that once at 12 weeks, it was just a little pinky, yeah its normal|`|8c1543nUaa	I bleed a little after sex too (7 weeks). My doctor said it's normal- the cervix is softer now and more sensitive. Don't worry unless you start getting pains at your pelvis. Just watch it and don't have sex again until the bleeding has stopped.
miOor5SRaa	I used the clear blue one with the smileys last month, Idk why but i just simply did NOT trust it! This month i have switched to first response & am much more confident. <br>  <br>  When i detect my LH surge we BD every night! Only once will lower your chances however it could have been that lucky one.Getting pregnant is like roulette ( as im sure you know ). But keep in mind you only have a 30% chance of concieve per cycle!  Good Luck Lost Of Baby Dust!
NMzlbWt8aa	It could very well be the baby.  Thats around when i started feeling mine, they felt like butterfly wings.  Now im 21wks and i feel the baby all the time...  It will get stronger and more noticeable in the next few weeks.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	How can you not be sure if it your baby of course its your baby that's moving ill give you one more week and you'll know for sure no dought|`|IB4ACy4maa	He is going to become a proffesional dancer when he grows up.|`|7SIaeZVYaa	it's normal no need to worry|`|hIzQyflqaa	popping and flutters is probably right, i felt baby move at 14wks with this (2nd preg), usually its around 18wks to feel movement but depends on persons size etc, i doubt you will feel nudging, baby is too small for these feelings! wait until you are being nudged! its pain and joy at the same time! my baby is breech and her head is constantly headbutting my ribs!|`|G766dQjtaa	It could be the baby. Some women won't feel the baby until after 20 weeks but some might feel it early. With my first I did not fell him until after 20 weeks but with this one I felt him at 13 weeks.
91hxNCfWaa	Wow, you had a late baby shower! She should be coming soon, try to watch old boring movies that should put you to sleep :) Also, I heard sex helps hurry up the labor, but ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  *EDIT: You're due in April?(according to your name) It's not even March yet, how do you know you'll go over your due date? :P|`|MtC3CWZraa	My doc didn't check me until 35.6 weeks and I didn't dilate at all until 37 weeks. <br>  <br>  Going over your due date is just about the norm. The stats I've seen on WhatToExpect.com say that 50% of babies are born after their due dates. I can attest to that - I was due last Thursday. It kind of sucks, but I also realize it's not going to kill me to give her a few more days.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I was not (and haven't been as my doctor is away on vaction) been checked. I'm asking the nurse tomarrow to check (37 weeks 3 days then) I want to know.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about dilating at 34 weeks, it will come. I have a weird feeling that I will also go overdue. Don't stress about it, your baby is healthy!|`|hfNXDCPQaa	My mother had me at 32 weeks. She had no contractions and was dilated to 6. Go to the doctor and get checked out. Maybe you can get some medication for your pains. Concerning "getting it over with" you can definitely do that. My brother was born a month early because he was too heavy (he was 9 pounds at 8 months. He would have been over 10 when he was due)<br>  Hope that helps!
vmWEm4Jzaa	the peeing is normal and also the cramping and baby being in your ribs but the swelling and headache you may want to call your dr about. it could be preeclampsia. there should be someone on call to talk to you and help you decide weather you need to go to the hospital or not!|`|CpiLHcTlaa	call your doctor to get your blood pressure checked your probebly fine but just to be sure he may want the take a urine test to look for protein.  just try and get in today if you can.|`|82BSdiyCaa	Call your Dr.. It may be nothing but swelling and headaches can be symptoms of something much more serious, like high blood pressure, which needs to be monitored closely.<br>  <br>  Please don't wait, call your Dr, just to be safe.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes!|`|8sDVsQAGaa	You could be retaining water and that would cause the swelling and frequent bathroom breaks.  If you are worried don't hesitate to call your doctor or go get checked out.|`|NMzlbWt8aa	From what ive read, this is normal, but i havent experianced it yet. Maybe call your doctor, because it could be dealing with your blood pressure.  Good luck hunny!
miOor5SRaa	I really think you could be, you are showing many symptoms! You could take an HPT in the am to be sure, they should be able to detect the hcg hormone !!

3ODE2IBBaa	well it doesnt make a lot difference and there is no research that proves it but some say that you should make a pillow under your hips and elevate for 20mins,,,also lay down straite and down get up immediately ok,, baby dust$$$$$$$|`|CbKOO4HFaa	I've heard you should lie down for at least 20 minutes afterward.  That's what I did and it worked!  I've also heard that it helps if you put a pillow under you.  Anything that helps the little sperm combat gravity and get through your cervix should help.

vY5HUrQPaa	Have your wife's health thoroughly checked out, lab tests, etc. Look into the possibility of C-section. Good diet, light exercise, if all else is OK'd, why abort? There have been reports of 60+ year-old women giving birth, when it was thought they had gone through menopause.

j2mRop0laa	We had a primary care physician for years for our girls and it worked out great, as the doctor was really up to date on a health issue my daughter has.<br>  Since most children do not have the specific health problem my daughter has, it has been difficult finding a good pediatrician. Our doctor moved, though and we did find a wonderful pediatrician that shares an office with a specialist that specializes in my daughters issue. We see them both! <br>  I think every single child has different needs and sometimes 1 doctor isn't even enough. You may find yourself needing one of each.|`|25e0c280da6dad2a9e01aa347df1e70aaa	I don't have kids yet (we're trying though!) but when I do we will be using our primary care physician. I love my doctor, he is only about 10 years older than I am, has a wife my age and has 3 little kids. So he knows what kinds of health problems my husband and I have as well as being up to date on all the children's viruses and whatnot. Plus, our doctor is super easy to get into, I can call in the morning and either get in the same day or the next day. I've also heard way too many complaints from my friends who are parents about it taking weeks to get a ped appt and they're ALWAYS running late. (that's how it is here in Chicago anyway...don't know about other cities) <br>  <br>  That's just for us though, I don't think less of people who see ped's.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	We use a family doctor so we can all use the same doctor. It comes in handy when we are all sick and she has been flexible with our alternative views. I found that a pediatricians office seemed rigid in care.
MtC3CWZraa	None of it works reliably. You can Google "Ways to Induce Labor" and try every single thing and still not go into labor. Being patient will get you just as far. I've given a few of them a try obviously without success since I'm overdue, but at this point, I've decided to just sit back and let nature take its course - until Friday when my doc plans to induce me if labor still hasn't started.|`|UrAeAYRFaa	WHY???<br>  Are you past your due date?

Don't you know what you are doing? You are creating a living being,By<br>  messing around with mother nature, for it is probably not time for him/her to join the human race, The planets aren't in the right place yet,The<br>  numarical date & time hasn't arrived yet, for I believe that everything, Everything happens for a reason beyond our understanding, I'm splinterring<br>  off in a differant direction......In short, Take it from an old dragon, who can empathize with you,<br>  Going through the same process twice, & Yes,The last month is absolute HL, The good thing is, You won't remember it, & in my opinion, If man were the<br>  one to have babies, The human race would not exist,<br>  For I believe that women have a much higher pain<br>  threshhold than men, You can do this.

vOomJtbsaa	Hmmm your SIL sounds loveeeellyyyyy *Sarcasm*<br>  <br>  So I have a story as well, I love that you just asked this question!  There's this one evil lady at work that I've worked with for about 8 years, she's been there for forever, don't know how because nobody can stand her, but she's one of those types that will do almost anything to get to the top, stab people in the back, sleep with superiors, etc etc.  Yea she's DRAMA!  Anyways, she's always commenting on peoples children behind their backs, she said one of my best friends (that I work with) baby was hideous.  And she said it just to be horrid, because her son was a sweet, blonde haired, blue eyed little doll.  Come to find out last week I got the word that she said my baby boy has huge ears.... I'm like OMG how could she say that?!  Because he doesn't and say what you want but he's clearly a cute kid!  Well she makes comments that breastfeeding is gross, that she doesn't have large breasts so she won't....when breast size has nothing to do with it, she's also said many, many times that I spoil my son because I pick him up when he cries, the list goes on and on.  She's a ***** on wheels to be frank!   So, the point of the story is that TODAY I found out through another girl at work that the ****** is pregnant!! I'm dumbfounded, I don't know how she'll raise a child, she smokes weed all day and I mean ALL Day, from 5am before work in the morning and then after her 6 hour shift and all night long (which her husband is always on her case about because it's breaking their bank), makes rude comments about other peoples children and refuses to even give breastfeeding a shot because "it's gross."  And this lady is going to be a Mom!?  I wouldn't ever wish harm on anyone, but there's really a little part of me....errrr... maybe a big part that wishes she'd blow up to the size of the cow that she is during her pregnancy and then give birth to a really hideous 3 headed baby!  Hmmm one can dream no?! LOL  I don't know how she's gonna do it, she's evil and that poor pooor baby.... I wouldn't wish a mother like her on anyone! And I can only hope she quits smoking marijuana during her pregnancy.   Poor woman may be realizing very soon how harsh words said about HER children feel.|`|JBzNXFidaa	That is very sad. Some people are justt not fit to be parents. And it's very unfair on the baby. The only thing I can suggest is get a group of people who care (family, friends) and feels the same as you, and just help out as much as you can. For the babies sake.|`|AA11756768	Sounds like there is a good chance someone else will end up raising her kid which of course would be better. Hopefully she changes after having the baby, but it doesn't sound very likely.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Wow, that sounds awful. <br>  It sounds like if she doesn't give the baby up for adoption - which I think you should pressure as much as you can! Try to appeal to her selflish nature - you'll be the one caring for this child. <br>  <br>  I don't think she'll change. I've known women who had accidentally gotten pregnant, or had done so because of their partners - but once the baby was born (or within a month) they were as good and loving as any other good mother. But none of them actually intended to harm the baby - they might have smoked, had a drink or two durring the pregnancy, or decided not to breastfeed - but they never meant to do harm. This women seems neglectful and intentional in her abusive behaviors. <br>  <br>  I really hate selfish women like that.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	My cousin. She couldn't wait to hit the clubs again. She would leave her newborn baby with her sister who is mentally handicap and has violent seizures. In fact she would leave all 3 of her kids all over the place just to go out and met a new latinos every week. She would rather he kids go without necessity's so she can buy weave for her nappy head. I is sad. Truly.|`|TJusfEnlaa	I was very non maternal when I found out I was pregnant - but not to that extent!! I didn't really fully comrehend I was going to have a baby until I was about to burst - but I like to think that good old maternal instincts kicked in and my son is now 9 months old and I have never ever left his side. I love him to bits and would do ANYTHING for him.<br>  give her time, this may also happen to her... birthing a child is such a surreal moment, no one knows how they are goin to handle it until they have to...<br>  If she does speed around the baby i would report her...|`|gNKW86ueaa	I unfortunately do know someone like this. They're immature (despite their age) and think the world revolves around them. She has these constant "medical problems", which are really just ways for her to get attention from other and pills to support her habit. <br>  <br>  It's troubling to see someone bringing such a precious miracle into this world who doesn't want to give it the best possible start and the best possible life after birth.<br>  <br>  My sister-in-law is also preggo, due in may. She just turned 18, is a high school drop out and a pack a day smoker. She didn't have her first OB appt until she was far enough along to find out the sex of the baby. She and my brother live with her parents and are both unemployed. <br>  <br>  It breaks my heart to see babies brought into this world without being given what they deserve not only during the pregnancy but after. How do we (as a nation) expect to be able to pull ourselves out of the rut we've dug into if we're going to keep producing members of society who don't strive for the best because we're teaching them not to?|`|ovBNlMTsaa	YES.  My sis n law. She has a one and two year old and she leaves them to play by themselves all day long in their rooms.  They only come out for meals.  They walk around in their diapers, no clothes.  Most of the time the trailer is filthy.  And when they have bath time, she simply fills the tub up and puts baby shampoo in there, and just leaves both of them in there unattended.  They have terrible diaper rash, red and raw.  They are hardly spoken to.<br>  And she doesnt put sheets on the two year old's bed and the one year old has dirty sheets and oftentimes, both her and my brother will sleep in until 12, 1, or 2 pm, and in the meantime they're both up<br>  And they eat alone, whatever, nothing healthful|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Wow her attitude is quite disgusting. Quite a few of my friends are like this sadly - one doesn't want a baby "sucking off her boobs", one doesn't want children cos it'll "mess up her figure" and another has said they'd only have children if they were guaranteed a girl cos "boys are annoying"...... my mind boggles.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I've known someone who was self-absorbed who turned out to be a wonderful mother...but never anyone like this. I pray she turns her life around, or this baby will suffer the consequences. Poor thing.
VMASMHX6aa	Some women who have PCOS have elevated levels of lutenizing hormone and so they get positives on OPKs all the time. Unforuntately it sounds like you are one of these women and that OPKs are not going to be of much use to you.<br>  You will have to be very alert to all your other signs and judge ovulation based on them.
vOFdHvlvaa	The average baby at 27 weeks is about 2 pounds and about 15 inches long, but every baby is diff. so urs could be smaller than that or bigger than that.  <br>  <br>  I’d describe a 2 pound, 14/1/2 to 15 inch baby as being less than half the weight of a 5 pound bag of sugar and 2/1/2 to 3 inches longer than a ruler.  Lol sorry if that doesn’t give u an accurate portrait of it, I just can’t think of anything else.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps though and good luck, :D.<br>  <br>  The first site is where I got the weight from and the height is the 2nd and 3rd site, and I estimated from lookin at week 28 (baby about 16 inches) and week 25 (baby 13.5 inches).  The 4th site has the same weight (2 pounds) and says that the baby is about 14/1/2 inches long – They describe it like about the weight of a head of cauliflower.  <br>  <br>  For the 4th site if u go below the pic it’ll say Go to Your Pregnancy: 27 Weeks and then u’ll see the info, lol for some reason it goes back to the pic even when I copy and paste the site when I’m in the info part.|`|AA12395149	About 14.5 inches and two poulds, abdout the size of a cauliflower.|`|qJBMdL7gaa	Your baby weighs around 2 lbs and total length is around 15 inches.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	<a href="http://3dpregnancy.parentsconnect.com/calendar/27-weeks-pregnant.html" rel="nofollow">http://3dpregnancy.parentsconnect.com/ca...</a><br>  have a look at this website, it gives a week by week description of what happens in the pregnancy and has a picture of what your baby would look like if you gave birth now.<br>  There's even a gadget that you can put on your google sidebar so that you don't have to open the web page to see what baby looks like!

AA12395149	If you want to see her, and feel like you are getting in better control of your PPD, then you should see her.  However, I think you should research and see if your area has a support/therapy group of women with similar problems.  <br>  <br>  And I don't want to seem rude, but it may be your hormones that are making you read too much into actions or comments that the other two said.  I highly doubt that the third thinks you should have had an abortion because she works in an abortion clinic.  No one can predict whether or not someone is going to have PPD and I just can't see someone thinking that a woman should have had an abortion because she is now suffering from PPD.  But, if you don't feel comfortable with the other two, and your first therapist feels you need to see someone more frequently, keep researching.  Good luck, and try to reach out to your family and support persons as much as possible during this hard time.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	keep looking for another doctor, but also keep her, until you find someone you feel comfterable with|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	Wow...well try to find someone who can actually help you!  hope your problems get resolved soon. or try to find someone who has had a child and has gone through this. maybe you gals could give each other support..

rIzx4OEWaa	Hello Liz nice to hear from you, I have heard of this an can also say because my wife agrees an she's a nurse, that doing so to a new born baby can cause breathing problems as they may have trouble catching there breath so it is wise not to do for any prolonged period. a slight tickle is Ok for a few seconds an will do the baby no harm.<br>  you just have to remember that even though they are new born there body is still forming in certain areas an it is best to be safe rather than sorry. Hope you have a great time with your new family addition, congratulations on becoming a Granny  :-)|`|wyAtVqbOaa	How old are you lot?  Your mum is still alive, you are alive, your child is alive and they have just had a baby?<br>  <br>  I was told this many years ago - apparently they laugh so much they are not able to breathe and only start breathing when they relax after they have lost consciousness.  <br>  <br>  I don't know how true that is but mine never had this when I tickled them and I tickled them a lot.  <br>  <br>  Next time you see a Doctor or your child see's the health visitor, ask them.  Ok, you will get conflicting information but I would trust the one from the Doctor more.|`|msNXomjTaa	I have heard that tickling, especially extended tickling, is actually not good for babies.  I have no idea if it is an old wives tale, or whether there is something to it.  However, it is a widely held belief, which your mom seems to share.|`|d5dKlgEPaa	I heard that tickeling leads to studdering latter in life. i'm sure its just an old wive's tale|`|xHlcnkgWaa	I've never heard that, i tickle my two year old and he loves it.  I think she may of got her facts wrong!!|`|AA10183528	shes nuts. the worst you would do is give the baby hiccups|`|C8Djjxqkaa	If you are a grandmother it is time to stop listening to you mum.|`|AubmEoYgaa	That's just a old wives tale LIZ. Go on like you are but not when you Mum is around because she truly believes that can happen. I have four son's and when they were young and was pouting or crying a fake cry. I would grab there hands and pull their arms straight up and then the brother's would start tickling him until he quit pouting and faking a cry because he was laughing so much. My son's didn't have any convulsions or anything else and guess what they do it to their children. Laughter is good medicine for a lot of things, especially the soul and a smile will melt your heart. You're right, always listen to Mum, she is the best friend you have, just don't take the old tales to seriously, that's just the way she was raised. Best to you fine lady.

rTaaIXSuaa	Something in your mom's life is affecting her.<br>  You mom may also be suffering from depression or some form of mental illness. I am not a doctor but I say this because I have experienced this almost exact situation before when I was in my teens.<br>  My mom and I used to have such great times then it gradually declined. My father at the time gave her a choice of seeking help or he was going to take us and move out. <br>  She was finally diagnosed as having severe depression. <br>  Has there been a situation in your mom's life that maybe the cause of her attitude?<br>  I think you and your dad need to really need to discuss some possible treatment for your mom.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	I'm sorry you are having such a bad time with your Mom.  You said that you use to have good times with her, did something change.  An illness perhaps or a change in finances.  Both of which you can't do anything about, but would put things in perspective for you.  Try talking to your Dad again, maybe he can help more.|`|22eb312dbb14b4b8f995bc33606eb782aa	Two warning signs, she is jealous of other social contacts and she "cuts you off", stops talking to you. This is a big one, its called emotional blackmail, and it will get worse.  What is happening is that you are getting older.  She is afraid of losing you.  Parents like this are fine when the children are little, but as you grow older, you need her less.  If your mother is a stay at home mom that means what she percieves as her reasons for existence will soon be growing up and moving away.  <br>  <br>  There are several things you can do:<br>  Call child social services, they will counsel both of you.  <br>  Read up on, research, google, "narcissistic parents", or<br>  stop by my yahoo group, children of controlling parents.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and take this seriously, both of you need help!|`|9cc0c00f58e6e10378e53a1546d4ac44aa	Show her what you have just put...it might shock her into realising how hurt you feel...or write it in a letter. <br>  <br>  Your dad seems to feel the same way so maybe talk to him a bit more about it and see if he can speak to her for you.<br>  <br>  Hope things get better for you soon :)

OLXv3DEAaa	I think emailing him is not a good way to talk about such an important subject. <br>  Right now might not be the best time for you to discuss/decide this honestly? You just had the baby so your hormones and emotions aren't quite the way they should be. And since you just had the baby he may be feeling extra stressed too or overwhelmed. <br>  <br>  He may not ever want more kids? Maybe he already has more than he wanted originally, or just doesn't want to raise anymore? Or it could just be the current situation- new baby, 3 other kids, etc- making him feel like this. <br>  <br>  I think maybe talk about it one time with him just to let him know how you feel and then wait again for a few months until things settle down to really discuss it seriously. Just ask him what the reasons are for not wanting more kids and tell him you were hoping to have another and see how it goes? If you think that might be too upsetting a conversation then don't do it now. <br>  <br>  The two of you DEFINITELY need to figure it out and come to an agreement before you are married but its maybe not the best idea to get into the issue right now.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I think he would, that is something that can hurt a relationship, maybe make a deal with him, once his other kids and yours are older, and less of a handful, maybe then have just one more baby|`|lGcpXteaaa	Honestly, you should definitely concentrate on your son right now, there is no need to be thinking about another baby yet!<br>  Your hormones are everywhere right now, and that longing feeling of wanting to be pregnant again will slowly fade until you are ready for another.<br>  Why not mention it in another years time or so? That way there wont be the hectic schedules of a newborn and the stress etc...<br>  <br>  No man would want to be thinking about more children, ask him in an email to delay the vesectomy. Tell him he might change his mind later on in life, so there is not point getting it done so fast.<br>  <br>  But for now, concentrate on giving your son the love he needs.<br>  <br>  x|`|be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	He has already been there and done that.  The last thing he needs is another baby.  What about the kids you already have?  You are robbing them to feed another baby.  How heartless.|`|08GDBedGaa	babe, i think you should relax firstly, your gonna be  a little hormonal/emotional for a couple of weeks! put your attention in to you baby boy, you and your partner can discuss this in a little bit when you've calmed a little and he has had a chance ti adjust to the new baby boy, takes men a little longer for it to really sink in and when my baby was born, i wanted 10 more straight away!! he may have his feeling because of his previous experience and if you in a few months Still cant agree them maybe you need  re-discuss your wishes and check you both on the same path, good luck and enjoy!! :)|`|E87JwnACaa	first of all, e-mailing him at work would be a WRONG thing to do. Work is for working, not personal stuff. <br>  <br>  The man has three kids. He thinks that's enough, and it's probably more than he can afford. YOU NEED TO RESPECT THAT.<br>  <br>  It is, then, up to you -- do you love him enough to not have a child with him? I very much doubt he went around 'giving' babies to these other women. Sometimes pregnancies happen. <br>  <br>  I repeat, it's up to you. What do you value most? You should be proud to have a guy who knows when to say enough is enough. (although enough can be different for everyone.)|`|4xEOjmVraa	You do not think the two of you have not made enough babies?  Give me your mans phone number.  I might just be willing to drive him there and pay for the surgery myself before you get knocked up again!<br>  <br>  Get a grip girl!|`|8RCOlWdMaa	You really must talk to him as soon as you feel able to. I know you feel bad at the moment because of your hormones, but suggest that neither of you make any decisions regarding the future until you are able to get back to normal (mentally) and this will release you from dealing with unnecessary additional stress until you are stronger and can see things clearly without getting too emotional.<br>  <br>  You probably have a distorted view of the world at the moment. When you can talk to him without wanting to scream at him (!) explain how you feel and you may find that he will be more understanding. Please don't email him, especially at work. If you feel you need to, write him a letter explaining how you feel now and how you want to have his support to deal with your feelings now so that you can discuss the situation later. Leave the letter where he will find it and be able to read it quietly , in private, so he can consider your feelings without pressure or divertions.<br>  <br>  Whatever the outcome, you have a gorgeous little boy - enjoy him, he will always be there for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

vOFdHvlvaa	My son is 8/1/2 months old and i just started giving him some gerber veggie puffs 12 days ago, some gerber mini veggies 9 days ago, some gerber fruits puffs 8 days ago, and some gerber mini fruits 3 days ago and he's doing great with those and loves being able to pick up food and eat it.  I haven't tried anythin else yet and don't plan to for awhile, i gave him this stuff so he can learn to pick up food for later on, and i chose these particular foods cuz they are made to dissolve in babies mouth so it's easier for them to eat.  Some babies it takes awhile for them to get used to chunks of food in their mouth and to learn how to chew, so it may take a while before she doesn't choke on the food, so be very careful how much u give her and make sure the pieces are very small.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter is 7 months old and has had some small finger foods.

But my daughter wouldn't eat pureed foods at all so I wanted her to start being able to eat something.  The little puffs are great because they dissolve in their mouths.  I would wait on the wagon wheels for a little while because I saw a post on here once that someone's baby choked on one.|`|JBzNXFidaa	I went down the path of BLW for my son. All I give him is finger food, really. He is nearly 10 months, and he has fruits, veggies, meat, pasta, toast. You have to make the pieces fairly large, in a stick shape, and not too soft. <br>  <br>  Generally, they won't choke. They will gag. If they are making lots of noise, it's not choking. Choking is silent, so you have to watch them when they're eating. Babies have a very good gag reflex, and as long as you are watching, they should be fine.|`|cfkgnbCNaa	the doctor will tell you 12 months.... but I gave mine finger foods at about 8 or 9 months. They will always choke a little at first, just learning to eat real foods. Just keep a real close eye on them. Try green beans or peas, even mac and cheese.|`|p6AMoTs8aa	i started with the gerber puffs at 6 months she was loving them of course you have to supervise them to make sure they dont choke.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I started those things at 9 months.

If you don't know when you ovulated, take your test about 20 days after you had sex (and if it shows negative, take it again a few days later just to be sure - sometimes you can get a false negative early on in the pregnancy). You may also have a blood test taken at your doctor's office within one-two weeks after sex if you want to find out sooner.|`|8cVANnllaa	you need to wait 3-5 days, that gives your body time to finish the fertilization process (if it is even happening) <br>  <br>  don't freak out, what ever you do. if this happeded very recently, (i'm talking like 1-2 hours ago) you can take a birth control pill and that might stop it.<br>  <br>  how old are you, anyway?|`|zPgjfWflaa	atleast 19 days after the sex took place.

e4M4uQXNaa	I love so many of these!<br>  <br>  I think my favorites are Isla Kate (gorgeous first name, short and sweet middle), and Seth Gavin (sporty sounding but sweet).<br>  <br>  But all the girl names are great to me.

ejQ3yg9Naa	They do a pap smear in the beginning of your prenatal exams and test for STD's, so it's gonna happen either way. Let them know you think you might be pregnant and let them do a pregnancy test though so you know for sure if you are.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Wow, I'm so suprised people are saying it can harm the pregnancy. I had one my first prenatal appointment, they never told me it could hurt anything. I just got told it's normal to spot a little after which I didn't. I'm 10 days away from my due date so I guess it's not a big deal now but nice to know for future pregnancies.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I have never heard of your cervix turning blue when pregnant.  That's news to me.  If you are pregnant the doctor may be able to tell with the position of your cervix, or if you are far enough along, with the size of your uterus.  Otherwise probably won't be able to tell.  Good luck|`|AA10327722	I don't think your cervix would turn blue.  If it did something is seriously wrong.  If both test are negative, you aren't pregnant unless you took them to soon.|`|hpnZ8awvaa	I blood test would've picked up if you were pregnant more than likely.<br>  And pap smears are designed for seeing if anything is wrong with your bits down below, not to see if your pregnant.|`|fUjsE0LRaa	tell ur doctor if u think u may be preg he will do a pee test to confirm...if u go ahead with a pap-smear it can abort...<br>  tell him just in case tho.|`|AA11085356	I have never heard of a blue cervix... Just let your doctor kno before the exam.
WnbutJsuaa	Hell yeah because things change u know! i totally agree with u and i think any teen would 2!|`|10LIhgtkaa	Yes, we should be able to switch spots.<br>  <br>  My parents, and most parents I know, are clueless. Yes, yes, they were kids and teens once as well, but they seem to forget as they age. They keep thinking they know what's going on, how their children feel. They have no idea. They apparently can't remember the turmoil, the fear, the depth of feeling that kids feel.<br>  <br>  Everyone who says they remember, do you really? I doubt it. You sit on your 'I'm older, therefore I know ever so much more than you, kid' high horse. You don't remember the wonder, the rebellion, the desire to be your own person rather than the person your parents are demanding that you be.<br>  <br>  Honestly, parents can't know what they're child is going through for the following two reasons: 1. They're children are not clones of them, therefore they see things and feel things differently. 2. Parent's aren't growing up in today's atmosphere. So while they think that teens and kids are spoiled with technology, they really have no idea of the extra difficulties and pain that it can bring.<br>  <br>  So many parents are arrogant and smug, thinking that because they're older, they're better. My parent's tried to scare me by saying that living on my own would be ever so difficult and I wouldn't be able to buy food, and I'd run out of money, and I'd never be able to make it and I should be grateful for the hell they were putting me through. Then I was kicked out and it was bliss. I had plenty of money, I could afford all kinds of food, it was so easy. I don't have credit cards, I don't have debt.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, most parents know what it's like to have a crammed schedule and not be able to talk to your friends. I mean, they do have kids, right?|`|Nn5pKe8baa	There is soo much new technology and the truth is that most parents HAVE NOT been through what most normal teenagers do today there was NOT a such thing as emo kids back when our parents were teenagers! Although they have maybe been through some of it but NOT all of it! so all you parents saying that you have been through every thing your teen has ITS NOT TRUE!!!!!! teenagers do things wayyy different than back in those ancient years!  and plus parents don't always know what their teenager have been doing for example some goodie good teenagers get pregnant even when their parents aren't expecting it! like the movie Juno her parents weren't expecting Juno to be pregnant! you NEVER know what your teenager does!  WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES AND WE DON'T NEED OUR PARENTS HELP!|`|5OgCrE3Yaa	Most of our parents have experienced what we are going through...Right now, most adults are pressuring kids to do better in school because of the depression. I am 14 years old, and I already have a career picked and know most of the career already (website designing). It is pretty simple. I also know how band practice is during Marching season. We practice 3 hours a day 3 days a week, and on Saturdays we have contests that take up the whole day. Just tell your friends that you couldn't call them because of your family. Good luck :^)|`|8c1543nUaa	They know how you feel. They went through it too. People aren't born adults. You'd be so surprised to find out how difficult our parents have it. I thought it was easy- then I got married. And am having a baby. Believe be- you've got it so easy. I know you stress, but wait till you have to pay your own bills and take care of your own house.

(yeah right) trust me, enjoy life now because soon youll be having to hold a job, pay bills, pay rent.mortgage, car payment, insurance, utilities, keeping meals cooked and the house cleaned,you name it, youll be responsible for it, then if you happen to have a kid or two who is as ungrateful as you are youre REALLY going to have fun...... trust us when we say, youve got the easy job right now.<br>  <br>  <br>  there WERE emo kids, and every other kind, they just didnt have a name. no one recognized depression in children, it wasnt thought to exist back then, there werent counselors in every classroom, in every school, available for every little complaint a teenager could have. our problems were dealt with by ourselves. every generation has had problems, they just differ  according to the times.<br>  <br>  <br>  if my biggest worry in life was that i forgot to text jenny back and shes going to be mad, i would be tickled to death, you kids need to get a clue. get you  a job, let mom and dad quit theirs, let them lay around on the internet, the phone, YOU pay for their cell phones, and computers, and internet connection, power, water, gas, rent/house payment, cook their meals...let their only responsibility be getting up and going to school (oh the horror)  sure , wed LOVE to trade places, maybe some of our ulcers would heal up, and a few of you kids would learn to be a little bit grateful.|`|IFGgQ99iaa	Honey , once in our life, we used to be kids also, and we went through the exact thing you are going through right now.

PqPc10Fgaa	Well when looking after someone with a person with disability ...they have to work more harder, then they do with reg kids. ...I work with preschool kids, who are on disability. The thing is....each of those kids have different kinda disability.<br>  Some of them, look like there all normal and cant find a darn thing wrong with them. Also other kids..I could tell  that they seem something wrong. So when working with kids or adults who have disability. You kinda need to find out what is wrong with them first. Everyone is different and act in a different kinda way. <br>  <br>  But anyway about your question.....Since that's your friends older brother. He may already know of what to do with his brother. Im sure he has to change his dipper, give him sponge baths. Give him food that is right for him. Depends of what he has....Maybe he has to eat foods that are soft for him.  ....But if you really wanna find out more of what he does. Why don't you ask if u can help him out. ..."2 heads are better then one" Like how that saying goes. <br>  <br>  Well hope this helps =]|`|ju4we8j0aa	It depends on what disease he asks.<br>  I'm sure you could ask him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Chances are he makes sure his brother stays safe and out of  trouble and helps focus his attention toward some appropriate activity.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	We don't know your friend, or his brother. So if you want to know more about it, you had better ask your friend.
YWAoSctPaa	Congratulations! <br>  <br>  I would go to the doctor and make sure he/she says that I am pregnant. I would also get a sonogram whenever the time comes.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	I remember being scared up until I was 38 weeks pregnant.  I spent my entire pregnancy reading every parenting book I could get my hands on.  I remember that the sound of a lullabye made me burst into tears because I wasn't sure if I would be a good mom or not.  I received a lot of advice about how much a baby complicates life.  I'm unsure why.  I loved every moment of my daughter's infancy.  Taking care of her took a lot of time, but in all honesty - I LOVED it . . . every moment.  (It may have helped that she slept through the night right at birth.  lol)  You'll do great, don't worry!|`|qYUvRURaaa	Havne't had any yet and i am 27 years old, but i would ask alot of questions.

I also suggest reading pregnancy books at leisure and getting a good obstetrician that listens to you and you feel that you can trust them.<br>  <br>  Good luck and way to go!
9cc0c00f58e6e10378e53a1546d4ac44aa	My baby had this also, its totally normal :) try to keep her face clean by using cotton wool and warm water, and pat dry after. <br>  <br>  If the skin gets dry you can put aqueous cream on her.|`|O4JuH8zmaa	Oh that's normal (most of the time). Some people call it baby acne. If she's not bothered by it then just leave it alone and let it pass but if she's scratching at it or seem uncomfortable then you need to get it checked out b/c it may be something else.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Baby acne, it's normal and most babies get it. It will go away on it's own in a few weeks with no treatment.|`|Bw18seFqaa	its just acne.. my baby recently had this.. it looked like a rash all over her face!  It only last for about a week or so.
BxpGdVTOaa	Abigail. It's classic, and when you get into all those weird spellings, it confuses people. If you are naming your child a common name, I think you should use the common spelling. Of course, that is just my opinion... but speaking as a person who has a common name with an odd spelling---it's a lot of hassle. You always got to correct people or spell it out...<br>  Also, I think Abigail looks best that way. The other ways just don't make sense.|`|Elxuvon8aa	only Abigail  unless two B's|`|2rOQyvaKaa	The other spellings look weird and ridiculous.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	I prefer Abigail (I know an Abbey, Abigail, & Abbygaiyle)|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	I like the traditional Abigail the best.|`|dwOLnFnlaa	I hate made-up spellings, so Abigail for me!|`|uawYSzqWaa	yea, i like the normal abigail the best and definately not Abigayle. Abigale is okay too|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Abigail|`|xLPB0Z2maa	Abigail|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Abigail.  I don't like alternate spellings.|`|AA10076709	Abagayle|`|HMPdnhApaa	Why change the spelling? It would be such a pain for the child to have to spell it out all the time..|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I like Abigail.|`|8sDVsQAGaa	I am having a boy but if it was a girl I was going to name her Abigail and spell it like that.
teDI6RQ8aa	I would tell my child that Fido is sick, and if we can't help him get better, then he'd be better off being with Jesus.  A mentally healthy child, even most mentally disabled children, will get over this in time.  The safety of family members to not be bitten far supercedes the wants of the child.<br>  <br>  I have to wonder why you hated your parents up until you were 20 years old for this.<br>  <br>  Edit: We had a dog that had the same problem, and the vet diagnosed her with neurological problems and said it would only get worse.  This was after she bit my mom and we put her down.<br>  <br>  Edit: This happened 13 years ago.  Your grandpa did what he thought was best.  Your parents gave him permission to do it, so they did what they thought best.  My advice is for you to get past this and move on.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	if he was starting to bite and children in the house then i would have given him up as i would have been afraid to leave him alone with the kids maybe they didnt know he was ill|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	I would put it down.  A dog showing any signs of aggression is likely to turn on ANYONE.  It was luck that you and your sister were never the victims.  Especially since training did not help.  There are neurologic diseases that cause aggression.  Just like with humans, unfortunately a dog can't say this is whats bothering me or tell you that something is wrong with him.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I wouldn't have given up on that dog.  It sounds like it had some really big emotional issues and could have benefited from real training.  Its important when you have a dog to take responsibility for its actions and to teach it what is appropriate and what isn't.  Dogs that have been abused are a lot of work to rehabilitate, but it can be done with a lot of patience, training and exercise.  There could have been more done for this dog. I don't know what i would do if the dog bit my children though.  that would probably be it for the dog after that.  I wouldn't take the risk to my children.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	that dog needed some major training and therapy (alot of dogs benefit from agility is what i meant by therapy, as doing that sort of thing can improve dogs self confidence, etc).<br>  <br>  <br>  May also be good to try this in pets section as some ppl there may be able to give you some more knowledgeable info on the dog.|`|t8SucbqFaa	They were trying to protect you! The dog might not have attacked you yet but there was always the possibility of it happening. How would you have felt if the dog went after your sister? And the dog went after your mom that is enough cause to get rid of the dog. <br>  <br>  I found a puppy a while back that my son loved. He was constantly playing with the dog. We don't know why but the dog started becoming aggressive as he got older, possible bad breading? He snapped at me one day when I was trying to take him outside to go to the bathroom and drew blood. That was enough for me so the next day he went to a shelter. I cried and felt horrible for taking my son's friend away but how worse would I have felt if the dog hurt or killed my son. Family before pets.You can replace a dog but you can't replace your child.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	You just have to realize that people handle things differently. And it's almost a "respect the elders" sort of deal--your grandfather is no doubt set in his ways, and sometimes you just have to work around that. You also have to deal with the fact this is in the past.<br>  <br>  My grandfather (now deceased) used to drown/kill kittens when his barn cats had too many. That absolutely disgusted me--why not spay/neuter? But of course, it was a different time, and hating him wouldn't have helped. He did what he thought was right.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry you lost your dog, but it sounds like the seizure (coupled with the abuse) is what the deal was. I'm sure nothing would have helped.|`|25e0c280da6dad2a9e01aa347df1e70aaa	If I worked really hard on trying to rehabilitate the dog and it wasn't helping I would have taken the dog to a shelter. I know you lost your best friend, but an animal like that is not safe to have around children. I don't blame your grandfather one bit. Think about it this way, how do you think they would have felt if the dog DID end up turning on you and ended up ripping your face off, or what if the dog escaped and ended up hurting another child or possibly killing him/her. It's not a good scenario is it?<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I love animals and I grew up with dogs almost my whole life. But you always have to put children's safety first. It really stinks that your beloved pet had such a traumatic and abusive start and he cannot be blamed for his bad behavior. But sometimes love, nurturing, care and training isn't enough. He might have just been too abused. I'm really sorry, I know how it feels to loose a pet, but think how horribly you would feel if your parents lost everything because they got sued because your dog permanantly disfigured someone. You have to look at it that way too.
sbedPdLDaa	Its been 5 weeks since I gave birth, and yesterday I went in for my 1 month appt. My doctor is going to insert an IUD when i get my period, and she made me an appt for 8 weeks..and told me i should be on it then.

qJBMdL7gaa	The epidural is a catheter(small tube) inserted in a space in your back. They inject medicine in it...so as long as they keep injecting the medicine-thats how long it will last. They usually stop injecting the medicine when you get about  8 cm...so that by the time it wears off(around 1-2 hours) you can feel the contractions to push.<br>  My best advice-tell your friend, dont get the epidural until she absolutely has to, or until they tell her "last call". I waited until the contractions were really bad before i got mine-i was 6-7 cm... my baby was out before it wore off, so i didnt feel a thing :)|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	No, she will most likely not get it right when she walks into the hospital. She has to be in a certain stage, not too far but she can't just have started dilating. The "Numb" part lasts about an hour or two. The "Pain" part, lasts until they take the needle out. <br>  <br>  I'd suggest she get one. They are amazing!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Well once you get the epidural they can continue to pump medication into you through it so it can last as long as you need it, they keep a needle in your back so they can continue to pump the medication into you, like every few hours she may need more because the pain will start to come back.

bo4MguzVaa	by the time you are pregnant it is usually too late for health insurance to cover the pregnancy expenses.  They usually have a waiting period for pregnancy benefits to begin.  <br>  You need to ask anyone who is giving you health quotes how the plan will cover your current pregnancy.  They should explain.<br>  <br>  Group is usually the best bet during the open enrollment period-if it's possible to do that.  Open enrollment means they can't exclude your pre-existing conditions.  Private insurance can easily exclude.<br>  <br>  But it would be good to have health that would cover any complications that can arrise b/c of your pregnancy.  So you might have to still pay most or all your pregnancy expenses, but if somthing abnormal happens to you or your baby you could be covered- you need to ask to be sure.|`|95oEmw5paa	The ground is pretty much covered with the responses. But once the baby is here, you will need the insurance for the baby too. So, while you are inquiring about yourself, also inquire about the baby's coverage as well.<br>       Good luck with pregnancy, delivery and wish you a very healthy baby.|`|TSYrJqTaaa	By google to collect some related information or you may try using answer engines like yahoo answer or yedda.com to get some related ideas.nonetheless,If you prefer some direct resource,here <a href="http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/free-online-health-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/fre...</a>  is a good one from my own experience.|`|CKPMkfvfaa	If you are already pregnant, chances of being accepted by a health insurance company is minimum.

x1HRE0HBaa	He is your father, and you should listen to him, and he does have the right to tell you what to do. But him pretty much abandoning you does change this around. He shouldn't tell you what to do completely because he doesn't know you all that well or what you're like. You should talk to him and tell him that your more responsible than he thinks. Come up with a agreement about you leaving the house. Like if where you're going is close, if someone is meeting there, if there is parental supervision, and so on. <br>  Hope it helped!|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	yes of course he does, he loves you.<br>  be sensible.|`|wZAeBisbaa	I don't think he's in the army because it's fun or because he's self-centered.  He may be doing it because it's a secure job that can provide a good income and benefits for his family.  Military service sometimes requires long periods of separation from one's family.  Now if you'd said he'd rather be out drinking with his buddies, I would say he's not acting like a parent.  But serving in the military is something that a lot of parents do.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself why he wants you to have someone with you when you go out.  Is it because he gets a kick out of telling you what to do, or could it be that he worries about your safety?  If you feel safe and he disagrees, that's the time to discuss your different perspectives.  Maybe you can compromise on certain times and places when you can go out alone.|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	He's your father.  Whether he's been a good father is completely different.  Yes you do have to show him the respect of listening to what he says.  And it's not like he's telling you to do something crazy.  I'm sure there is nothing that YOU have done to make him worry like this.  It's the crazy people out there that kidnap young girls.|`|ZawzpmaGaa	I'm 15 and am going through the same crap with my dad.

Take his advice in stride though being that he hasn't really been around.  It sounds like he is looking out for your best interest or at least he is trying to.  Maybe you should tell him how you are feeling about him disappearing and then coming back into your life.  I know it's really hard trust me.  My mom traded me for a car during my parents divorce.  I didn't see her for 11 years then all of the sudden she shows up at my door step when I was 19 and still is trying to tell me what to do.  It's not easy being put on the back burner by somebody that gave birth to you but it happens.  Don't get angry at him though it won't do you any good.  Let him know where his place is in your heart and his place is in your home.  Tell him that you are angry it may be hard for you to say to someone that you barely know but in the end it will be worth it.  Trust me.  And good luck.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Whether he's been around or not, i'm sure that there is no doubt that he loves you.  I guess he doesn't recognize that he's kind of invading because he hasn't been around.  He's doing it because you are his daughter and he loves you.  It's not like he wasn't around because he's a dead beat, he's serving his country.  You would probably benefit from sitting down with him and talking out some stuff.  I'm sure there's lots of feelings you need to share with him so that you can have a father daughter relationship.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	He is your father and yes he has every right to tell you what to do. You are his child regardless of circumstance.<br>  He is in the army and you can't knock him down for that! It is his job and his money that is feeding you and helping out his parents who take care of you. You may not see it but there is involvement. I was a navy brat and hated my father because he wasn't around. But as I grew up I knew that that was his profession.<br>  Give your dad a break. He's not 'lecturing' you. He's being a protective father. Even if he hasn't been around (because of his job), he is your father by all means. <br>  Respect him and listen to him.|`|gwOT5aH3aa	he's your dad which means he's family. whether or not, he's still family and that's what matter in the end.|`|Gzbs22hyaa	Yes they do|`|2SliUBwIaa	He's your father, so you still have to listen, but that pisses me off.<br>  <br>  LOL when I was at dad's there was hardly anyone home right after school, so I had to walk about 1/2 a mile, and my mother fussed at me for that. What the hell was I supposed to do?<br>  <br>  Oh well. Yeah, he still has the right, but I guess you ultimately have control over yourself.<br>  <br>  Also does he have custody of you now? If not then he really does NOT have the right. If your grandmother has legal custody, he can't control you.

I hate to judge but this is what my doctor told me:<br>  <br>  Once your water breaks you have 24 hours to deliver to prevent infection.|`|Ev9Rnm0Xaa	labour normally starts within 48hours of waters breaking otherwise the person risks infection and would be in hospital.if she was in labour then they would have her in hospital trying to stop it.and if her waters broke so early on no self respecting doctor would just send her home.|`|aYlXO4wCaa	Either she's mistaken or she's just lying. <br>  When your water breaks, you will have to stay at the hospital no matter what to be monitored for infections. And at 6 months, there'd be NO WAY they would just send her home if her water had really broken.|`|MTudTggKaa	If her waters broke and she was 6 months, she'd be in hospital right now|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	there is no way that her water has broken and the doctor will send her home because she will be at risk of infection
FUBNkpwSaa	well i got pregnant the first time my husband went in me. <br>  but now we are trying again and it hasnt been as quickly.<br>  some tips that have helped us out are do the baby dance like bunnies 2 weeks before her expected period, and I also have heard and for me it was true... if you two can both orgasm at the same time it can help out the sperm. <br>  evryones different though, but just keep trying!!<br>  and make sure your not using any lube or anything like that cause it can kill the sperm sometimes.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|bWyKAFwuaa	Well it can be one try or a thousand trys...if you have any sperm you have a chance...just be patient and it will happen...it was one month for #1 and now it is 6 months for #2

I guess its because teenagers test their limits and their trying to become individuals. Many parents wants their kids to stay "babies". Its just a whole experience i guess of growing up!|`|UftgUcCIaa	Just because being a kid is easier and being around kids is easier. When we're older teens are under stress which puts their parents under stress and leads to a lot of fights. Plus us teens want more things that are WAY more costly then a stuffed animal and stuff (like car, tv, computer, ipod, cell phone) and sometimes parents will not agree.|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	because most teenagers want freedom and to be able to do what ever they want. and parents are very protective and want their children to grow up to be successful.|`|NYJgiVxraa	i dont acutally hate them but we get in disagreements sumtimes  cuz there is too much misunderstanding. no one listens. everyone talks but no one plans to think through of what the teen or parent is actually saying.|`|PV4ZvQGlaa	I think its because as teenagers people are fighting for freedom and parents are the ones who restrict us.|`|lfKEHk66aa	Even at 17 your hormones are still really kicking in now.

Well Guess what I was not preggos. I even went to the doctor who told be later on that I had a slightly abnormal pap, but now my period is due to come on and nothing again. In other words the possibilities of these signs makes us crazy because they are so alike. Just relax and see what happens

hIzQyflqaa	when your pregnant/trying to concieve? why is this question in this category? dont use sunbeds every day! 8 mins is a bit long for 1st session, give it a few days!|`|sbedPdLDaa	You did everything fine. If you didn't burn you may want to try 10 minutes tomorrow. That's the only thing. Everything else was fine.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Interesting pick of categories...<br>  <br>  Every bed is different and the amount of exposure to UV will depend on that, what type of bulbs, and how new they are.  You would probably do well to stick with that time limit for another couple of days.  You can move up in minute or two minute increments after a few days.<br>  <br>  I can't remember what type of lotion that is...accelerater, bronzer?  Personally, I always get a bronzer so that it makes my skin darker without having to soak up so much UV.  Your choice though.<br>  <br>  Yes...those goggles are fine.  Never tan without eye protection.  After every use you should wash your goggles in warm soapy water.  (I wouldn't touch the salon's goggles with a ten foot pole, buy your own.)<br>  <br>  You will feel warm...more so if you don't use the fan.  It gets pretty hot in there.<br>  <br>  If you are burned at all...take a day or two off.  If you have an area that feels a bit sensative (butt/chest as they never see the sun,) cover those areas with a towel for half the time.|`|6pLLPdPwaa	what in the world does this have to do with trying to conceive?? I hope you are not tanning while trying to get pregnant???
RDgyb7W8aa	Yes I am old school, Dr Spock was wrong,  I am 62 years when I did something wrong my father took a belt to me.  After that I didn't do it again. I believe spare the rod, spoil the child. Growing up in the 50's and 60's there was no juvenile delinquency and very little teen pregnancy.  Now look what has happened since the started to call it child abuse we have much juvenile delinquency and a great deal of teen pregnancy. My views are not popular today but that is how I feel|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	I smell a troll but I'm going to answer anyway.<br>  <br>  YES I believe in spanking...<br>  <br>  Children that are still in diapers don't understand spanking...so don't spank them.<br>  <br>  It's not abuse.  Abuse is beating a child.  A spanking is discipline.  And there is a difference.  <br>  <br>  No you shouldn't make them watch you in the mirror or record it.  Are you mentally defective?<br>  <br>  It is not illegal.<br>  <br>  You spank them, it's not hard, you should never leave a mark/welp or anything like that.<br>  <br>  And why would you spank them on the front?  You spank them on their butt.  Don't hit genitalia, That's abuse...<br>  <br>  Don't spank them in front of their friends.  That just causes embarassment and the point does not get across because they are too focused on the embarassment instead of what they did wrong.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Those questions are really creepy.. why would a parent want to film themselves spanking their child?|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I think that spanking is a waste of time.<br>  <br>  It doesn't teach the kid anything about the lesson except to fear your spanking warning.<br>  <br>  I was spanked with a belt as a kid and it never taught me anything.My dad just said "don't do it again" and spanked me.He never sat down and explained why what I did was so bad and didn't ground me or take any privileges away from me.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that spanking IS abuse.Think about it...if you walk up and slap a stranger in public, it would be considered assault.Well, what do you think you are doing to your kids?<br>  <br>  <br>  "violence is never the answer" yet the parents doing this to their children is teaching them the opposite.Nobody really thinks about it that way, they just do it.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	By all means.<br>  I'm old school. I spanked my kids when they were little. Now that they  are older, they get smacked upside their heads if they get out of line.|`|PZwpRm9maa	I believe that there are some children that need to be spanked.  Like you for asking this question.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	OMG! no spanking it is so not necessary!! there are more than enough ways to discipline a child without spanking!|`|pnL5WTXMaa	creep|`|KPac9A2qaa	Calm down woman. Spanking is essential in my opinion, it is not abuse if you let the child know that you love them and you are doing it because you don't want them to grow up doing wrong things. Do not tape it do not use a mirror, its personal between the parents and the child.  Also do not spank other peoples kids or let them watch(creepy much???) You can do whatever you think is best between pulling down their pants or such. Do not hit them too hard or else it would be abuse, its suppose to sting their butts not kill 'em. It is illegal in some states so don't do it in publi or mention it in public. Im 14 now but growing up 2-11 I got spanked when I deserved it (and usually I did deserve it =) ) For older kids such as tweens or teenagers I suggest grounding because it is much more affective.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	hasn't yahoo suspended your account yet??<br>  reporting you again|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	your one sick ****<br>  <br>  <br>  your a sick little pedifile<br>  <br>  <br>  your grammer is horrible, learn to speak english dumbass!
YkX0GZoOaa	Your best bet would be to contact your local Planned Parenthood for this kind of information. You are not going to get correct medical information from this board. People are very sensitive about this and often spout misleading facts.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	RU-486<br>  <br>  RU-486 is a drug that produces an abortion. It is taken after the mother misses her period. It can be used up to the second month of pregnancy. It works by blocking progesterone, a crucial hormone during pregnancy. Without progesterone, the uterine lining does not provide food, fluid and oxygen to the tiny developing baby. The baby cannot survive. A second drug is then given that stimulates the uterus to contract and the baby is expelled.<br>  <br>  Women who abort with the drug RU-486 experience nausea, severe cramping, vomiting and bleeding. But the resulting emotional distress may have even more impact. Rather than being “over with” in a few minutes (as in a surgical abortion) this abortion could last for over a week. Then, when the woman finally does abort, she will expel a tiny dead human being - her baby. <br>  <br>  <br>  Suction-Aspiration<br>  <br>  In this method, the cervical muscle ring must be paralyzed and stretched open. The abortionist then inserts a hollow plastic tube with a knife-like edge into the uterus. The suction tears the baby’s body into pieces. The placenta is cut from the uterine wall and everything is sucked into a bottle.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dilation and Curettage (D and C)<br>  <br>  This is similar to a suction procedure except a curette, a loop-shaped steel knife is inserted into the uterus. The baby and placenta are cut into pieces and scraped out into a basin. Bleeding is usually very heavy with this method. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dilation and Evacuation (D and E)<br>  <br>  This type of abortion is done after the third month of pregnancy. The cervix must be dilated before the abortion. Usually Laminaria sticks are inserted into the cervix. These are made of sterilized seaweed that is compressed into thin sticks. When inserted, they absorb moisture and expand, thus enlarging the cervix. A pliers-like instrument is inserted through the cervix into the uterus. The abortionist then seizes a leg, arm or other part of the baby and, with a twisting motion, tears it from the body. This continues until only the head remains. Finally the skull is crushed and pulled out. The nurse must then reassemble the body parts to be sure that all of them were removed.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Prostaglandin Abortion<br>  <br>  Prostaglandin is a hormone that induces labor. The baby usually dies from the trauma of the delivery. However, if the baby is old enough, it will be born alive. This is called a “complication.” To prevent this, some abortionists use ultrasound to guide them as they inject a “feticide” (a drug that kills the fetus) into the unborn baby’s heart. They then administer prostaglandin and a dead baby is delivered. This type of abortion is used in mid and late term pregnancies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dilation and Extraction (D and X)<br>  <br>  This abortion is also used on mid and late term babies, from 4 to 9 months gestation. Ultrasound is used to identify how the unborn baby is facing in the womb. The abortionist inserts forceps through the cervical canal into the uterus and grasps one of the baby’s legs, positioning the baby feet first, face down (breech position). The child’s body is then pulled out of the birth canal except for the head which is too large to pass through the cervix. The baby is alive, and probably kicking and flailing his legs and arms. The abortionist hooks his fingers over the baby’s shoulders, holding the woman’s cervix away from the baby’s neck. He then jams blunt tipped surgical scissors into the base of the skull and spreads the tips apart to enlarge the wound. A suction catheter is inserted into the baby’s skull and the brain is sucked out. The skull collapses and the baby’s head passes easily through the cervix.<br>  <br>  Abortion is pricy and cost between 400-700 in the first trimenster and even more the farther along you are, there is the abortion pill which takes 3-4 weeks to compleet and dosent always work it consists of heavly bleeding and cramping which is very painful.<br>  <br>  Anticipated side effects following an abortion:<br>  The following is a list of side effects that are frequently experienced following an abortion. It is possible that you may experience these side effects for up to 2 to 4 weeks following the procedure. <br>  <br>  Abdominal pain and cramping <br>  Nausea <br>  Vomiting <br>  Diarrhea <br>  Spotting and Bleeding <br>  Potential more serious complications following an abortion.<br>  Although serious complications only occur in less than 1 out of 100 first trimester abortions and approximately 1 out of every 50 late term abortions; it is important to know the possible risks:<br>  <br>  Heavy or persistent bleeding <br>  Infection or sepsis <br>  Damage to the cervix <br>  Scarring of the uterine lining <br>  Perforation of the uterus <br>  Damage to other organs <br>  Death <br>  It is important to understand that these risks are rare and some are even present with child birth. What matters is that you are aware that they exist as you make an educated decision about your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you have had an abortion, call your doctor and seek medical attention if your side effects become severe or if you experience any of the following:<br>  Severe abdominal and back pain that prohibits you from standing up <br>  Bleeding that is heavier than a normal menstrual period <br>  Foul-smelling discharge <br>  Fever above 100.4 F <br>  Continuing symptoms of pregnancy <br>  <br>  The emotional side effects following an abortion will vary from woman to woman. Some women report relief after an abortion. The question that most people ask is, “What are the potential emotional and psychological risks following an abortion?” <br>  <br>  Emotional and psychological effects are more common than the potential physical side effects and they can range from mild regret to more serious complications like depression. It is important to talk through these risks with a trained professional who can address your questions and discuss your concerns.<br>  <br>  Questions about Abortion, call 1-866-942-6466<br>  <br>  What are the potential emotional and psychological sides effects following an abortion?<br>  The following is a list of emotional and psychological side effects that may be experienced following an abortion. The intensity or duration of these effects will vary from person to person. Here is a list of potential side effects that may be of concern to you:<br>  <br>  <br>  Regret <br>  Anger <br>  Guilty feelings <br>  Shame <br>  Loneliness or isolation <br>  Impaired self confidence <br>  Insomnia or nightmares <br>  Relationship issues <br>  Suicidal thoughts and feelings <br>  Eating disorders <br>  Depression <br>  Anxiety <br>  Are there individuals who are more prone to experience emotional or psychological problems?<br>  It is possible for anyone to experience an emotional or psychological side effect following an abortion. Women commonly report that the abortion procedure affected them more than they thought it would. However, there are individuals who are more susceptible to experience some type of emotional or psychological struggle. Below is a list of circumstances that may increase a woman’s chances of having an emotional or psychological side effect:<br>  <br>  Individuals with previous emotional or psychological issues <br>  Individuals who have been coerced, forced or persuaded to get an abortion <br>  Individuals with religious beliefs that conflict with abortion <br>  Individuals with moral or ethical positions that conflict with abortion <br>  Individuals who obtain an abortion in later stages of their pregnancy <br>  Individuals without support from significant others or their partner <br>  Obtaining an abortion for genetic or fetal abnormalities <br>  What are the recommendations for someone considering an abortion?<br>  Get Help – Probably the most important thing you can do when facing an unplanned pregnancy is to talk with trained professionals who can answer your questions and discuss your circumstances with you.<br>  <br>  Avoid Isolation – If you are experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, you may have the tendency to withdraw from others, keep things a secret, and try to face it alone. Although it may be difficult, make sure you are staying connected with family and friends who are there to support you. Isolation under these circumstances can lead to depression.<br>  <br>  Evaluate Your Circumstances – Take a look and see if your circumstance includes any of the situations noted above under those who are more prone to experience a side effect. Talk through this with someone who can help you understand what it might mean for you.<br>  <br>  Avoid Pressure – Stay away from people who are pressuring you and coercing you to do what they think is best. Whether you parent, place or have an abortion, you are the one who will have to live with your choice.<br>  <br>  Talk to Others – See if you can find someone who has gone through an unplanned pregnancy or an abortion and find out what it was like for them. Take a moment to ask questions of someone who has been there.<br>  <br>  ABORTION IS NOT A FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL!

It is advisable that the woman discusses her concerns with someone close who she can trust.<br>  <br>  Women should always contact their GP if they are pregnant and do not want to continue with the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  In the UK it is legal for termination to be carried out up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, but most hospitals and clinics will not consider termination beyond 18 to 20 weeks. For this reason alone, if a woman is considering termination, then she should discuss the situation with her GP sooner rather than later. <br>  <br>  The law states that two doctors need to agree that the abortion can be carried out. They will reach this decision if they believe there is a greater risk to the woman's mental or physical health if she continues with the pregnancy than if she has an abortion. The doctor can also take social circumstances into account when making this decision. <br>  <br>  The doctor will then usually examine the woman to determine how long she has been pregnant, and also tell her about the options for termination and the risks involved. The doctor will send this request to the nearest hospital or clinic, which will then make an appointment for the termination to be performed. Many hospitals now have early pregnancy clinics for this reason, staffed by nurses and doctors who will deal with the problems sensitively.<br>  <br>  What kind of examination will the doctor make? <br>  <br>  The doctor will make a pelvic examination to determine the length of the pregnancy. During this examination the doctor may also take a sample from the vagina to check for a bug called Chlamydia. If this test is positive, both the woman and her partner should undergo treatment. <br>  <br>  An ultrasound scan may also be used in the hospital or clinic to be certain of the length of the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  What are the different methods for termination of pregnancy? <br>  <br>  There are two commonly used methods.<br>  <br>  An abortion pill. This is for pregnancies up to nine weeks old and involves taking two drugs – called mifepristone and prostaglandin – 48 hours apart. These have the effect of causing the womb to contract and shed its lining so that the embryo is lost through the vagina. This can be painful and some women feel sick or have vomiting and diarrhoea with these drugs.<br>  <br>  A surgical termination can be performed up to 13 weeks. This may be performed under local or a general anaesthetic. A sterile tube is introduced into the uterus through the cervix. Suction is applied through the tube and the pregnancy terminated. Most women leave hospital on the same day. From 14 to 19 weeks the technique is slightly different in that it is known as a surgical dilation and evacuation where the neck of the womb is stretched open to allow forceps to remove the foetus.<br>  <br>  A medical termination can be performed up to 24 weeks. This involves giving the patient a course of two different types of medicine. The first medicine (mifepristone) is taken by mouth at the hospital or clinic, with the woman returning 48 hours later. She will then be given a medicine called a prostaglandin, either by mouth or as a vaginal pessary. The termination usually occurs within 12 hours of this when the woman passes the pregnancy vaginally. Pain, is often experienced but pain relief will always be available. (Surgical termination is also available at the 20-24 week stage although this is more complicated and requires a two-stage process. The first stage involves stopping the heart of the foetus and softening the neck of the womb, and the second stage occurs the next day by surgical evacuation.) <br>  <br>  The type of termination a woman is offered will depend upon the length of her pregnancy, the facilities available and also her personal preference. What complications may arise from a termination? <br>  <br>  Fewer complications arise if the pregnancy is terminated within 10 weeks. If a woman suspects that she is pregnant, and does not want to continue with the pregnancy, she should contact her GP as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  There is no such thing as an operation or procedure that is completely risk-free. Termination of pregnancy, whether medical or surgical, is a safe procedure but complications are possible. <br>  <br>  The most common complications are described below. <br>  <br>  Bleeding <br>  <br>  After the abortion it is normal to bleed for a couple of days. After that, the bleeding will decrease for a couple of weeks. A period or menstruation will, in most cases, occur after five to six weeks. If the woman bleeds more heavily than she would normally, it could be because her uterus has not been emptied completely. If this is the case she should ask a doctor to examine her. This complication applies to both medical and surgical terminations. <br>  <br>  Pelvic inflammatory disease <br>  <br>  If a woman has an unpleasant vaginal discharge, a temperature and abdominal pains, she should contact her doctor.

vcRm8ps8aa	WE cannot go to jail for this|`|fMnzjULCaa	Yeah you can. Get a job loser or else you'll be in jail. They can also take your license. Time to grow up. You think you are stressed out? Imagine how your girl feels trying to figure out how to take care of a baby on her own & that she has to keep bugging what is supposed to be a grown man to get a job.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Depends, if you are in jail you don't have to pay child support so if that's what you are worried about you should get yourself arrested. My aunt's ex-husband is supposed to pay child support, but rarely does and he's not been arrested. Though, she did date a bounty hunter who's job was to hunt down deadbeat dads who weren't paying court ordered child support, so in some situations you could be arrested. It's in the better interest of the child for the court to garnish your wages to pay child support, though. If she's still your girlfriend though, what's the problem? You helped make the baby, you should help raise it.|`|AA10843092	First off the child must be proven to be yours. (you sound like you are not American but if you are not paying child support is illegal when it has been ordered.)  Keep a calm head and wait after the baby is born ask for a paternity test.  In the mean time look for work just in case the child proves to be yours. (they can not take all of your income cause you still have to live, but you may want to look into saving for payments cause it does look better for you to volunteer payment than to have payments garnished. <br>  <br>  btw use protections always condoms and spermicide is a man's best friend.  You should also seek counseling cause nothing is worse than taking what you've contributed too out on a child that is not responsible for any of this.  Any male can father a child but being a father takes a real man.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	I think it varies on states, but she will have to file for child support, take you to court (usually) and if she does that and judge rules that you are to pay her child support and you do not pay it you could go to jail for it.  although its more common that they start garnishing your wages, and when you file for taxes they will take most if not all of your return for back due child support.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	they will take it out of your income, they state may pay her while you are out of wirk then you will owe a LOT more in back child support to her and the state<br>  <br>  if she does not file for child support from you they wont take it UNLESS she applies for cash benefits or food stamps|`|nhgQKvwEaa	well duh you can go to jail for not paying child support. my ex step father had a warrant for his arrest because he owed 50,000 dollars in child support. Don't be stupid, pay up for your kid. You have a responsibility now. And why are with someone who is so much older than you???|`|5ZwIASCgaa	Well she can take u to court and they will decide what u pay and considering u dont have a job they will prob make u pay the minimum i think its like 25 but it could be different in every state...u both could decide on ur own how much to pay or what to do to...i would get a dna test and then go from there if it is ur child man up and take care of her or him in anyway u can it aint about the money its about love! o yes and if u do go to court and u dont end up paying u will owe back child support and eventually have to pay it and if u dont they will take money from ur bank account take ur car ur license anything they can|`|82BSdiyCaa	If you two can't agree on an amount the courts will base it on a % of how much you make. If you don't pay it then it will follow you where ever you go and can even affect potential jobs you may apply for. <br>  <br>  Try to find a good middle ground with the mom, if possible, it will make the situation easier if you can work it out without the courts involvement. Good luck.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Yes actually you can. She has to go to friend of the court and get things set up (visitations/custody/child support) don't be too worried about the CS it goes on a sliding scale. But don't you want to help her as much as you can?|`|ynjgq4GZaa	get a job and grow up.

HKbbt9slaa	There could be many reasons for the tenderness, but nausea is something else. I personally sould lie and say don't worry but that would be a stupid thing to do on my part. The best thing for you to do is wait for your cycle and if it doesn't come,DONT WAIT! GO GET A TEST! It is always nice to have a hand to hold in this kind of situation but please don't let not having a shoulder to lean on be your reson for not finding out the truth. Good Luck! and remember: no person knows your body like you do so if you don't feel right just be on the safe side and take a test or go see a doctor.|`|i6gZ5GQgaa	Put your hand in there and feel around to see if there is a baby in there.  That way you will be sure.|`|ex2KhEfdaa	Pretty Sure Your Pregnant|`|5Y9Ekm0naa	I get breast tenderness and cramps right before I get my period... so you may just be about to get. But remember, even if you do get your period, YOU CAN STILL BE PREGNANT!  Some women get a few periods before they actually stop for the remainder of the pregnancy. Buy a few different tests... different brands. And see if they all give you the same answer, just to be sure. And of course... see a doctor.|`|Q3aeb6IYaa	You could be having breast tenderness and cramps because you are due to start your period.  I wouldn't freak out just yet.  If you are truely concerned go and buy a test.  Make sure you do the test in the morning with your first pee.  You can get a false reading if you do it later in the day.  Also if you go into the doctors and request a test.  You find out right then and they are pretty accurate and then you would be able to talk about options.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|da498dbd39048a1057d2c4954514a889aa	its not to early to take a pregnancy test. They have Early result test out now. I would say more than likely you are, especially with the sore breasts, that was my first sign and I went out and bought a test and sure enought we wre expecting.|`|YWAoSctPaa	I believe that you are pregnant.|`|zPgjfWflaa	GO BUY A TEST!
LTD0qL6Yaa	Your cycle should be regulated after taking to pill for 3 months. Remember though DO NOT skip any tablets, make sure you take them all. I hate to say it but when you do decide to stop taking the pill to TTC you will have a withdrawal bleed and it could be heavier and longer lasting than your periods were before. I hope thats not the case for you as that would mean that the pill was a waste of time. Good luck and i wish you baby dust..|`|GLJkGgloaa	Well I stopped Birth Control Early November and just found out that I was pregnant. It's different for every women.

It doesn't look bad but that would make me mad|`|6FPpkmi6aa	Well you can always put small ponytails on the side, that always gives it a cute look.<br>  <br>  If you put some really cute clips and bows on your hair, people won't really care about how long it is.<br>  <br>  But you know, people really like it when others get new haircuts, and yours isn't that bad. Imagine if the lady gave you a pixie cut, you wouldn't even have a soulution for fixing it.<br>  <br>  But it looks fine, maybe wear some headbands and a few clips to distract people. And remeber little pigtails on the side would look cute.<br>  <br>  ~Hope I helped!   ^ ^<br>  <br>  ~?AnimeLover101~|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Next time, speak up!

wyAtVqbOaa	I'm sorry this isn't that clear to me.  Explain what to her?  That she has to use the toilet?  If it's that, I would leave the subject alone.  As long as she's using the potty, don't worry about it.  If she's not using the potty and wetting herself, then put her into pull ups then if she wants to use the toilet, then she can and if not, you don't have a tonne of washing to do and you only need to change it when it's full.  If she refuses the pull ups and wants knickers insist that big girls don't wet their knickers and when she has a dry pull up for the day, she can have her knickers back.  <br>  <br>  I know it's frustrating, especially when they've been dry for so long but stop worrying about it.  <br>  <br>  Even though she says she doesn't want to be a baby I bet she's missing some of the attention that she use to get before brother came along and now that he's sitting up and starting to move around, she's lost more of the attention. <br>  <br>  Stop threatening to take toys and tv away and start rewarding when she does use the toilet - stickers worked a treat with us - especially when they had a theme they were into (spiders webb with stickers of spiders was the best one but fish in a tank also worked as well as a mountain next to a river) as well as a kiss and cuddle.<br>  <br>  Please don't worry - she will stop this behaviour and will go back to using the toilet soon.|`|AA10843092	Talk to her and ask why she is not going anymore. It could be something frightening her into not wanting to go anymore.  It is normal for a child to revert in ways when they are stressed out about things. Find out what has been stressing her out.  Also it could be that you are no longer making a big deal out of her going and she feels ignored.|`|ju4we8j0aa	Ask her why.<br>  <br>  Or try and make your bathroom more appealing to her, add things she likes to the walls and suck.<br>  <br>  She could just be scared of getting flushed down the toilet.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
AA11296427	There was penetration, you lost you virginity. And yes, you could still get pregnant!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|LUg9dgb5aa	sex is sex.<br>  your not a virgin, and theres a chance you could be pregos.<br>  might want to take a test, just in case.<br>  good luck, :]|`|z3Oed98laa	Your probably not preggo but u did loose ur virginity.... srry! Theres no way to get it back now|`|SpYS7VYoaa	Um, well firstly losing your virgenity hurts...alot, alot alot.. And yes, you lost your virginity, breaking your hymen has nothing to do with it. Most girls who are really athletic or horeback ride or something have their hymen broken that way, or with tampons sometimes. So if he was in you, then your not a virgin anymore, even if your hymen is still intact(but it will hurt when it does) And I think theres only a very very very small chance you can be pregnant, but I'm not even sure of that.|`|y96eYj0Faa	There are no "requirements". Most girls who have been raped still consider themselves virgin. Even though they were penetrated with a mans penis, it wasn't their choice. So therefore they still consider themselves virgin. I doubt you are pregnant and I mean  you are still a virgin if you consider yourself one. You didn't really have 'sex' so I guess not.|`|de3585a639a519d1686e00acd0c94d58aa	Nope!|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	You could get pregnant.  However this is very unlikely.<br>  <br>  As to virginity, by the strict technical definition what happened was penetrative sex, and therefore you are no longer a virgin.<br>  <br>  Whether you consider yourself a virgin is another matter.  Many people do things that might be considered sex and have sex in the name of the act but consider themselves virgins.  Most people would not consider what you describe sex.<br>  <br>  Some people have full, unprotected penetrative vaginal sex on more than one occasion, and just decide that they are 'new' virgins.|`|1thzSbS8aa	You do not have a "cherry". There is no such thing as a "cherry". If you are talking about your hymen, that's at the entrance, not anywhere inside.<br>  <br>  "An inch" is enough to make you not a virgin anymore, and "alittle tincy bit of sperm" is more than enough to get you pregnant.<br>  <br>  So no, you're not a virgin anymore, and yes, you could pregnant that way.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	actually u are not a virgin anymore..this sukz kinda thing,i know..<br>  but sorry to have to say it,but genital contact makes u not a virgin..<br>  BUT there is a slight chance u could be pregnant.just to make sure ur not,take the morning after pill(all hospitals have it,and family planning clinics).

I had sex after having a baby and he pulled out. Im not pregnant again, but there is a small chance. Also, If you intended on letting him penitrate you then you intention was not pure. Therefore you are not a virgin because a virgin is a pure vessile, which has not had any intentions on having sex or even trying before marriage. This is a fact, its in the bible. You also arent mature enough to handle the consequenses of sex for a matter of fact. I may still be 19 but im married and have become more wise especially after having a baby. Just think about babies and marriage. You dont want that at a young age. I strongly advise you to discontinue any type of sexual intercorse of contact untill you have found the right one. I got pregnant on birth control. Thats a thought to consider also.|`|da498dbd39048a1057d2c4954514a889aa	sorry hun but you are no longer a virgin.

5ZvALiclaa	how lovely to see a prospective father so happy about his impending arrivals!!! Wesley and Wyatt are lovely names! <br>  <br>  You should pamper your wife, give her a surprise trip to a spa with her best girlfriend or mother and get her a massage, facial, pedicure...she'll love you so much for it! If you can afford it, hire a housekeeper for the first few months to at least help her around the house while she gets used to being a mummy to TWO babies. Just someone to come in one or two days a week for a few hours will take the burden of cleaning off her hands. I would have desperately loved this if we could've afforded it!<br>  <br>  Also book a family photo session for about 6 weeks after the babies are born.....don't tell her about it, just make it a surprise! Or get her a pregnancy photo session as a beautiful keepsake.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|85V6cHe4aa	Congratulations!!!! We have twins,they are 11 now but its so exciting isnt it? Well she will probably be pretty tired,its tough work carrying a baby never mind two so do as much as you can to help at home,cook the meals when you can,shower her with affection.<br>  <br>  When your sons arrive im sure you will be a great help to her,be involved in all the caring and spoil her lots.<br>  <br>  I like the names too!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	congrats! that is so exciting. i can tell how happy you are.WOW two boys, lucky you.I have a 11 month old baby boy and expecting my second baby boy on the 15th of april 2009.Things to do for your wife,well just give her massages which help out ALOT during pregnancy,offer to make her tea or take her out if she is feeling up to it.Good luck and congrats.|`|AA11085356	Congratulations! <br>  <br>  I think the names are cute.<br>  <br>  Maybe she would like a mothers ring. I think it would be sweet to give it to her after she delivers. You can get their birthstone in it, and also engrave their names in it.<br>  <br>  Pampering is always good! She needs extra rest, so any help would be appreciated!|`|v2Awgh9Xaa	YAY! You should be the best dad and husband that you can possibly be, that's what you should do!  <br>  <br>  The names are cute too, but make sure they get good middle names too.

I'm just looking out for the little guys...|`|plI0WOrUaa	Congratulations!!!!<br>  <br>  I think the names are awesome!  You should give your wife a day at the spa for when she is feeling very tired and worn from carrying your lovely two boys.  She'll love being pampered.  Plus, there won't be much time for pampering when the twins are born!!  Good luck and have fun.|`|GWveqx61aa	well congrats, thats awesome, you should ask your wife what you can do for her, and for the names i like wyatt but im not a fan of wesley, sounds too much like lesley, sorry if you like it cool, all that matters is the 2 soon to be 4 of you, oh how exciting|`|IjkPBYlkaa	congradulations you killed 2 years in one lol i wish i would of had twins lol try to make her feel as comfortable as you can and help her relax dont let her do everything by herself give her all the attention youcan because thats wen you mostly need attention spend time..|`|t4HXotwEaa	DIAMONDS!

Be as understanding to your wifes needs, discomforts, modds, etc as possible. Being prego is not easy, especially in the very early months- morning sickness sucks- and in the last month or two of pregnancy- all the extra weight and back aches are not comfortable either. Maybe get her a lil gift from "the boys" once they are born- also known as a push present- a present for pushing out your lil bundles of joy.|`|uuceuyRyaa	lol gratz on twins =)<br>  <br>  but nothing you really can do but be nice to her extremely!!<br>  <br>  Give her foot rubs n make her food, let her sleep in don't wake her =)|`|GLJkGgloaa	Congrats!<br>  I have only been married 6 months and just found out that I was Pregnant!<br>  Twins run in My family so it will be awhile before we find out.<br>  <br>  But I love those names!

kc2Sa7ibaa	Nah. I think that is fine. I used to do gymnastics and competitive jump rope (double dutch and stuff... It IS a sport. Check it out on youtube!)and some of the coaches were horrible but I had one that I still keep in contact with even though I quit. I don't see anything wrong with it. She was kind of like a role model to me. Even some of the parents from the club I used to be a part of still email and call me from time to time. Heck, I used to go to some of their houses for dinner and bake with them. LOL! I don't think it is weird! Don't worry about your friend.|`|AA11293630	me personally, i think its weird.. but i guess if she's not saying or doing inappropriate things its okay..|`|6lSbmXunaa	No, it's fine.|`|d0Ofct85aa	Nope, It Not Weird at All xxx|`|seJxUXHCaa	No, you guys are just like best friends (: Haha.

iZk9jEBpaa	No way! It's completely normal to feel like that sometimes, are you going through a hard time right now? Have you had any problems at home? School? Friends? Emotions reflect in different ways including through hatred and anger, I've felt like that before and although it makes you feel mean you should know that the majority of people will feel like that at some point in their lives.

XKYP0sGQaa	As far as I am aware, green tea is green tea. <br>  <br>  Perhaps each brand/variate has a slightly different taste, but over-all the effects and claimed results are usually the same. <br>  <br>  Although, green tea alone is not going to give you a noticeably smaller belly, so for your own sake, please don't get your hopes up too much.<br>  <br>  If you want a smaller belly, then I would recommend you do a bit of cardio. Now, that works wonders.|`|DkT8znckaa	I think Green Tea is good for you all around. I like Arizona Green Tea. I drink it cold, but you can heat it up if you want. Also, Lipton and normal tea brands make green tea both in bottles and that you heat up. Hot tea is better for all that body stuff, I think. One of my aunts is obsessed with it.|`|xbgCwmbdaa	Please don't drink out of bottles - what a WASTE! Drink hot green tea- it has a better effect.

My life was saved."<br>  <br>  2.<br>  <br>  Then, the phone would ring again, and the next caller would say:" I am pro-choice. My mother was pregnant and she had no choices. I cannot understand how anyone could be anything but pro-choice."<br>  <br>  This has gone on and on for years and years.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	I am pro-choice - every woman has the right to choice regarding her body.<br>  <br>  With that said, I might ask if the general population is pro-life or pro-choice? Of course not - there are people who feel strongly one way or the other and most are somewhere in between. <br>  Adoptees I would think, would be the same.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I have always found it profoundly ODD that because I was born female (no choice of mine) I am automatically expected to be a breeding  machine. No matter how many men climb on top of me by force or by choice and walk away, I am expected to gestate, birth, and care for as many as I can conceive, because if I don't care for them I'm a crack whore. <br>  <br>   I would like to know how you feel about all the women who can't have children? Should we get rid of them because they are of no use to society? Shouldn't they be expected to fill their quota too? <br>  <br>  What kind of a mother can anyone be when they are exhausted, depleted of certain vitamins and nutrients because the baby takes most of them, and their uterus is dragging the ground from non stop repeated use? <br>  <br>  Pro life is a nice thought, but ummmm no, pro choice for me. <br>  <br>  As for pro choice as long as it's life, no offense Randy but since we're just being silly here anyway, I'd take being the sex who didn't have to carry and birth the children, or maybe splitting it up, I'll have the first one you spit out the next one. That would make me very happy. I would definitely be pro choice if that were possible, but since not everyone can take a turn, I have to agree with Linny G and a few others. Keep your rosaries off my ovaries. Until you can do it too, don't tell me what I have to do because I was born female.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	My husband is adopted and he is pro-life, but our friends, who are dating each other and are both adopted are both pro-choice!! Not only are they pro-choice, they have said that they would resort to abortion themselves! I found that strange!|`|frpCK0utaa	I am very adamantly pro choice. I think abortion should always be legal. Why? Because as a legal medical practice, it is regulated and must go by certain health standards. That way, it's done in a sterile environment, and if something is done incorrectly, at least the woman wont be too scared to go and get medical attention. <br>  <br>  If it is made illegal, women will resort to the practices of the past, such as back alley doctors who have to hide, and wont bother with sterilizing things. Also, if they are injured internally, the women will be toon scared of the legal repercussions to seek medical help.<br>  <br>  You see where i'm going? It's a nessasary evil. And i'm a firm believer in womens rights. I'd rather not see us take a few steps back.<br>  <br>  ETA: That's great that you are pro life, but others here are not. Would you rather we go back to the way it was in the 40s and all, before Roe VS. Wade. YES it IS about womens rights.<br>  <br>  I myself would never get an abortion, but i will never support any attempt at making abortion illegal.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Oh. My God. You wrote, "...but the baby is not apart of the woman- she/he has a separate heart beat, separate blood supply , separate DNA. Need I go on!" No. You shouldn't. You obviously have no clue about pregnancy or DNA. Spoken like a woman who cannot have a child of her own.  <br>   <br>  I am pro-choice for several reasons. The most important reason has NOTHING to do with the fact that I am adopted. It is because The United States Supreme Court has afforded me this right.   <br>   <br>  I am pro-choice for another reason. BECAUSE I am adopted. I HAD an abortion BECAUSE I was adopted. It is NOT the responsibility for fertile woman to have children to replace the ones barren women cannot have. Adoption does not guarantee a "better life", only a different one. In many cases, it's much worse. <br>   <br>  I mean, seriously...how many times are religious fanatics going to keep bringing up the abortion debate with adoption? WHY do you do this? Oh wait, I know- because if you can get your "movement" to outlaw abortion, you think there will be more fresh newborns for you! It doesn't work that way. Most women who have abortions would not ever even consider adoption. The Anti-Choice Zealots have fought long and hard to keep adoption records sealed. Their logic, and yours, is seriously flawed.<br>   <br>  Just look how wrong the anti-choice movement was regarding original birth certificates!! They thought the abortion rate would go up in states who were considering unrestricted OBC .The states who actually now reversed their open records access laws have seen a dramatic DECREASE in abortions. Again, the anti-choice folks were wrong. Dead wrong. Pun intended. <br>   <br>  You're not interested in anyone's opinion if it is different than yours. I will never sport a bumper sticker that says, "It's a child, not a choice." Because it IS a choice. And it has NOTHING to do with giving another woman whose body doesn't work my ripe fetus.|`|JP04HX6maa	My mother never planned on aborting me to begin with.|`|BTuFtui3aa	Of my friends who are adoptees, the pro-choice/pro-life breakdown is about the same percentage as the general population.

You do know that, right?  Your mother never MADE a choice.  She HAD no choice.|`|ioNKVW9haa	I'm an adoptee.<br>  <br>  And I'm pro-choice.<br>  <br>  But then again, I think that abortion and adoption have nothing to do with one another.<br>  <br>  Have you been listening to a word other adoptees have been saying, or are you only concerned with spouting off your own opinions?  There are adoptees here who would RATHER have been aborted than adopted.  <br>  <br>  So maybe being adopted has more to do with whether or not someone is pro-life or pro-choice... But not for me, as far as I can tell.<br>  <br>  My stance on abortion:  I personally would NEVER get an abortion... but I VALUE my right to MAKE THAT CHOICE.  And I do not think less of any woman who would choose differently.<br>  <br>  Nobody else has the right to make decisions concerning MY body but ME.  And you know what, you may not consider the fetus to be a part of the woman, but there are very REAL changes that take place in a woman's body because of being pregnant.<br>  <br>  And before you start spouting off about sluts and whores and such, perhaps you should consider circumstances like RAPE and INCEST.  I'm sorry, but forcing a 12 year old girl who was raped by her father to bear and deliver a child is WRONG.  <br>  <br>  Unless, of course, it's God's plan for fathers to rape 12-year-olds.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I'm a woman, an adoptee, and pro choice. <br>  <br>  I am also baffled at why a lot of "pro life" people claim to be for life when the life is of an embryo but against saving the lives of suffering  ALIVE human beings by utilizing stem cell research. These "pro life" individuals are also usually supporters of the death penalty, something I do not believe in personally.<br>  <br>  I support a woman's right to choose because I don't believe in allowing one section of religious faith to dictate the medical treatment of all women. What if your religous faith dictated that I should be burned at the stake if I wore a short skirt? Should that be made into law?<br>  <br>  Your religious faith should not be allowed to dictate legislation or medical practices just as mine should not. That is unconstitutional and unethical.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	Pro-choice.  And MY choice would be pro-life.<br>  <br>  Sounds kind of weird to be pro-choice when I'm dealing with infertility, but my infertility has NOTHING to do with another woman's body.<br>  <br>  The only time that I truly get angry about abortion is when it is done habitually by women who refuse to use one of the many available methods of birth control.  Other than that, it's not for me or the government or society to decide what a woman should do.<br>  <br>  And to address the question of "Aren't you glad you weren't aborted?"... sure I'm glad I wasn't.  And if I was... I wouldn't even be aware of it, so what is the point of speculation?<br>  <br>  If there are consequences, especially when it comes to the religious aspect of it, each woman will have to stand before God (or whoever she believes in) and be accountable.  It's not my job to judge.<br>  <br>  I won't say I would never have an abortion, the circumstances would have to clearly be a matter of life or death.  And as hard as I imagine it would be, if fertility treatments worked a little too well and I found myself pregnant with higher order multiples, I would consider selective reduction if advised to do so.|`|sbHJCxWCaa	Abortion and adoption are two separate issues...one is the decision to carry a fetus to term or not, and the other, is to parent or relinquish the child. <br>  <br>  What I don't understand is your premise, that because my n-mom chose to relinquish me, that that would make me feel that should be the best option for everyone. <br>  <br>  I am pro-choice, pro-parenting, and adopted.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	I can't be sure?<br>  <br>  The adoptees I know:<br>  <br>  1--My ex husband picketed the abortion clinics during the 80's and quit a job as a tradesman because he would not work at an abortion clinic he also filed suit to not have his union dues used to support abortion politics--so I think it's safe to say he is Pro-life.<br>  <br>  2--His sister also adopted has chosen to be hands on helping her own daughter as a single mother the choice of abortion was never even considered and she preferred to help rather then encourage her daughter to place her grandson for adoption... I think that looks Pro-life to me.<br>  <br>  3--My former brother in law an adoptee divorced his first wife when he learned she aborted their unborn baby--I think he might be Pro-Life.<br>  <br>  4--My cousin an adoptee was told during her third pregnancy the baby had problems and that giving birth was risky to her own health and that of the babies--she had the baby he is fine...

I guess you're still afraid of what I might say, eh?<br>  <br>  Despite my good experience as an adoptee (which I notice you've taken it upon yourself to say I didn't have...  so it's okay for you to tell me that I had a bad experience, but we can't tell you you're in denial?  do I have that right?)  Despite that good experience, I don't think it's my place to tell a woman what to do with her body, you know?  <br>  <br>  I can imagine what it's like to be pro-life.  But I am pro-choice.  Maybe if you could imagine how other people think or feel a little, you'd actually have a sympathetic bone in your body, eh?<br>  <br>  Anyway... cheers!  I'm sorry that you're so afraid of my words that you have to block me...  <br>  <br>  (And for those wondering, no, this isn't a second account...  This is my main account...)|`|ODosyM8zaa	I myself was not adopted but I have adopted 3 kids and have many adopted relatives. I asked my sister who was adopted by my parents when she was 8 and who is also pro-choice. These are her words:<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't judge until you've been taken away from everything and everyone you've ever loved. I remember a morning when I was 5, my sister was 3 and my brother was 10 and our birth parents came upstairs to our room (yes the 3 of us shared a room) and told us to get dressed, we were going to Disney Land. Two hours later we were sitting in a lobby with old half broken chairs and decade old magazines. Us kids waited in that lobby for 3 hours while our parents were in a back room. I didn't know this until much later but our parent's had decided to give us up for adoption. I can't tell you why exactly but I have a feeling they would've rather supported their drug habits rather then support us. <br>  <br>  I spent three years bouncing from foster home to foster home and nearly being adopted twice. Instead my almost adoptive parents found another someone a little better then me. During that three years my brother was molested and abused for 3 months before someone finally found out. He became an angry teenager and then an angry adult. 20 years later he is sitting in prison, waiting for the day he gets out. <br>  <br>  My sister had better luck thank god and was adopted within the first year. A few years ago we reconnected and now are the best of friends!<br>  <br>  So what does this have to do with me being pro-choice? If a woman is not able to care for her child, then she should have the right to choose. What if she gave that baby up for adoption and the same thing happened to it that happened to my brother? It's not a guarantee but there is a 50-50 chance. And I don't like those odds. I'm not bashing anyone, don't get me wrong!!|`|1TQUdfayaa	I was adopted years ago.  I'm not going to tell someone else what to do with her body. I'm pro-choice.  I don't really understand how anyone could believe they know what is right for someone else.<br>  <br>  I guess that's just me. Life is just more complicated than it first appears. Black and white is just for the movies.  Or for racism.  Not for the real world.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I am pro-choice.  The decision to be pregnant or to end the pregnancy is a big one, and if someone is informed, whatever they decide is fine with me.  <br>  <br>  I could have been aborted.  I wouldn't be around, my kids wouldn't have been born, I wouldn't have touched anyone else's life.  No one would be any the wiser.  I really don't think it matters that much.  This isn't a "low self-esteem" thing.  Its a realistic thing.  I could have been aborted.  I could have never been conceived.  There are a lot of "what ifs".  <br>  <br>  I think that a woman (and the man who contributed to the pregnancy, if he chooses to participate) have the right to decide every step of the way.  If they no longer want to be pregnant, abort.  Aw, are there a bunch of people who can't have babies waiting for one of their own?  Too bad.  My ovaries aren't there for anyone but me.  Selfish?  Damn right.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	pro choice.  I feel that every woman out there deserves to govern her own body and what happens within it.  I fully believe that abortion should be legal, and available to those who want/need it.  <br>  <br>  Why?  Because I don't think anyone else needs to have a say in what someone else does with their own body.  If I don't want to carry a pregnancy to term for my own reasons, I shouldn't be forced to.  Nor should any other woman out there.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Pro choice...I think everybody should have there own decisions & live with it...it's no body's business... I don't agree personally with abortion but I don't think I or anybody else should be making that decision for someone elses life!!|`|98cAYrhQaa	I am pro-abortion. I think abandonment/adoption should be illegal.<br>  <br>  I have zero tolerance for anti-choicers, they can all go to Hell.|`|ZM6ztWAzaa	Pro-choice.
1tmX7xbRaa	i am not saying i am for or against abortion however:<br>   taxpayers DO help pay for those kids but it's not right either. if you don't want to have kids then don't have sex or at least have PROTECTED sex. <br>  and when i say protected sex i don't mean ' oh i take the pill but i forgot' or 'the condom broke' use the pill CORRECTLY and use a condom. but mostly just don't have sex.|`|AA10031161	The thing is that there are a lot of options for those who are pregnant and don't want to be... options besides abortion.<br>  <br>  Adoption is a great example. It may not be effective in all cases, but there are still other options.<br>  <br>  Just cuz I'm pro-life, doesn't mean I feel it's my responsibility to pay for others' bad choices.<br>  <br>  I also happen to be pro-accountability.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW- Octo-mom AND her doctor were incredibly irresponsible in their choices. THEY should be the ones to pay for their bad choices, not me.|`|AA11156135	You can imagine how often it's stated by some women:<br>  <br>  "I hope I'm not pregnant, -if I am, I can always get (another) abortion."<br>  <br>  Abortion in Maryland was available well before Roe v. Wade in 1973. There were about 6,000+ abortions in the state in 1972. All a woman had to do is get a doctor's OK. After 1973, all Roe v. Wade really did is lessen the stigma and dollar 'cost' of getting rid of the yet-borns.<br>  <br>  So women now have sex earlier in the dating scene, earlier in age, with more partners, -and with less concern about contraceptives. After all, before AIDS, - there was a 'cure' for every disease and every pregnancy.<br>  <br>  So let's say irresponsible behavior increased 10-fold for women in general. Repealing of Roe v. Wade will just re-adjust women's approach about the true concerns of irresponsibility. I wouldn't be surprise if 90% of the pregnancy problem just "goes away" in a decade or two.<br>  <br>  Repealing of Roe v. Wade also returns the abortion issue back to the 50 states, - where is was to begin with, - before the activist Federal Supreme court judged by diktat.<br>  <br>  Just imagine if the womens' culture re-inforced the idea that "you're pregnant and not married? - no, not everything is going to be 'OK'". With that being the norm, women will become more responsible and everyone's lives will be saved, - esp. the baby's.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I am absolutely prolife and we do help pay for the unwanted and unplanned children. It's called paying our taxes!!|`|TwcAQPupaa	There are TONS of childless couples willing to "pay for" a child.  They are put on waiting lists where they have to wait for years just for a child of their own.  Adoption can be very effective.  No one forced these single mothers to have sex (of course that wouldn't be true if they were raped....but that's a totally different circumstance) so they have basically chosen the consequence when they choose to have sex.|`|113FoyMFaa	we do stupid, it's called taxes.|`|lzivF4Idaa	uhhm...im prolife and i pay for my child that wasnt planned **not unwanted** just unplanned. i dont need to pay for anybody elses cuz i wasnt the one having the sex in those cases. i take care of my business and mine only.|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Are you sure you believe in JESUS CHRIST?<br>   This question reeks of anti Christian values.<br>   Yes I do pay my taxes willingly and io do support welfare.<br>  Abortion is murder.<br>   I however think murder and welfare are not correlated in anyway shape or form.<br>   Next you will be saying lets get rid of unwanted senior citizens and unwanted unproductive people and therefore you bring up the question of what is unproductive and unwanted.<br>   At that rate you might as well bring Adolph Hitler.
SaRDq9iLaa	I remember the first time my daughter kicked.  I wasn't sure what it was at first.  She was very active before she was born!  <br>   <br>  Last night my daughter tried to crawl for the first time backwards.  She didn't go all the way on her knees- it was more of an elevated slide backwards.  Then she turned herself around in a circle on her tummy!  I am so proud of her!  :-)<br>  <br>  Congrats to you!|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Haha... when my baby first started REALLY moving, she jabbed me really hard once and it made me jump out of my seat and shout! I couldn't believe how hard she kicked (or punched lol). It honestly scared me to death because I wasn't expecting it at all. <br>  <br>  When my 2 year old daughter was born, I was so proud. It really surprised me that just having her alive and well was the proudest day of my life. I wasn't expecting to feel that way, but I definitely don't ever remember being more proud of anything, EVER! <br>  <br>  Today she's just been a little cutie pie. I'm always proud of her :)|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Aww that's awesome congrats!! I do miss that feeling...And yeah it used to make me jump all the time!<br>  <br>  My 2 year old (the youngest) today, FINALLY said mummy! He has said everything else, even the names of the characters in his fav kids show and the word 'trousers', but finally, today he said mummy! I actually got all teary!|`|1s3nddaYaa	m,y sons 1st kick was at 14 weeks, and you really couldn't tell, just felt like gas. nah i loved the feeling i didnt jump.<br>  <br>  the only thing my son has done today is NOT take a nap lol|`|7RhXX7qfaa	AWW thats sweet, I dont jump but sometimes he can catch me by surprise, and my other son said dada for the first time today.<br>  <br>  Now this bit will get me thumbs down but I have to say it: Please dont put your laptop on your bump, its just that the baby may be kicking because of the heat the laptop produces which isn't good and also you don't know how much radiation they produce its a bit like holding a mo bile to your ear all day everyday, the risks aren't proven but why risk it?|`|nYioXmnGaa	When my first baby kicked for the first time I was really scared i actually was in the docters office.My  fourteen month old son remembered  how to go pee  pee on the potty! This is a big milestone because he has periods of memory loss.That was a while ago though ! My seven month old son slept through the night last night! I was wonderful  I loved the sleep!!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!|`|xy0W50Lqaa	I first felt the little kicks at 18 weeks it was like a little tapping feel.  The kicks in the 3rd trimester always made me jump!  most of them were at night while I was relaxing but during the day it was always an unexpected moment.<br>  My daughter has started to walk and walking further every day, it's so cute|`|qGQCLFinaa	I remember the first time i felt our son kick! It is the most amazing feeling ever!! It did surprise me the first few times & once in a while throughout my pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I have proud mommy moments EVERYDAY!! he just got up so he's still not very talkative! but i'm sure i will look at him at least once today & think wow, I am so lucky to have this little man in my life!  He amazes me everyday!|`|KYkoPHpsaa	When I first started feeling the kicks I was surprised everytime and got really giddy :)<br>  <br>  She is now almost 3 weeks old I think when she burps i feel proud.. i dunno why lol|`|ABA3mXnKaa	My 6 week old son just discovered his hands!!|`|seOx7cWaaa	When i first felt my daughter i was like 21 weeks or something weird.. But i was at work and i felt like her arm or leg...like push out.. it was so weird. ... i couldn't explain it if i tried.. it wasn't like butterflies .. it felt like she was rolling over or something it was crazy.. from then on i fet them more and more..  i remember times where i'd be laying down and she must have been laying a certain way and like a body part was sticking out on my stomach and id touch it and she move away and start to kick more. they are fun moments!.. my daughter will be 13 months tomorrow! congrats and good Luck|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Aww congrats hun! Just wait, he'll be kicking your ribs black and blue soon :)!<br>  <br>  When I first felt my daughter kicking, I wasn't sure if it was her lol. It didn't make me jump when they got more regular, I loved them. Really miss them now =/<br>  <br>  I think my proudest moment today is the fact my daughter has slept a lot today, allowed me to shut my eyes for a bit! I have a cold and feel horrible.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	The first kick was 19 weeks for me. She was a strong little girl so I'd often have to stop for a moment or two to catch my breath, lol.<br>  <br>  My daughter successfully drank from her sippy cup without much help from me! She's 7 months, so that's a huge accomplishment!
sT7LYLTdaa	No, you dont have to go. If you are uncomfortable at all at going, then do not go! Regardless of if you are family are not. Plus, going to a party where there will be drinking is not a good idea, especially seeing you are only 15. So you can use that as an excuse of not going. If something were to happen and the party got busted, you could get in a lot of trouble by the police. Just maybe say you have something else already planned, or if you want to tell him the truth say im sorry, but no one my age will be there and people might be drinking and if the party gets busted I do not want to get in trrouble.<br>  Go with your instict! If you dont want to go, then you dont have to go!!!|`|BzGKDHjYaa	tell him the truth;<br>  or just make up an<br>  excuse :]<br>  <br>  &&you dont<br>  HAVE to go ;)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	nope<br>  go the next day|`|MW18liqTaa	Yea, no big deal. I wouldn't go.|`|hVVALFAPaa	I guess just stopping by for a few minutes is out of the question?<br>  <br>  Don't go. Don't subject yourself to a bunch of drunks.<br>  <br>  I would suggest doing something just for him to show that you do recognize his big milestone (turning 21)-- maybe give him a special card or something.<br>  <br>  Also, why is this in the Pregnancy and Newborn section?|`|TIqFAXo1aa	tell him - or- fake a last minute headache!|`|aDhc9n1waa	"party... don't wanna go!!!!!!!!!!!?? " <br>  DON'T GO ! <br>  No one ever said that you HAVE to go !  <br>  If you're going to be celebrating it on the next day, than why is it a "have to" on the night of his party?  If there's going to be no one there your age there, and there's going to be alcohol there, than surely you have no business there... aye ? <br>  <br>  So don't be stuck somewhere where you're uncomfortable.  Especially if you've had bad experiences with drunks. It's not fair to you.<br>  And you s houldn't be made to go. <br>  End of story.<br>  <br>  You're very wise, for knowing that you don't want to be around alcohol, and people who consume it, at 15.  Most at that age, want to be put and position, and when they are they abuse it.  Just like 80 % of adults who are old enough to drink, abuse it, and get put into bad situations, and endager themself's... male or female.  There is no "safe amount" to drink.  Especially when you're under-age. <br>  <br>  Hope it goes well for you.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	No, you dont have to go. If you are uncomfortable at all at going, then do not go! Regardless of if you are family are not. Plus, going to a party where there will be drinking is not a good idea, especially seeing you are only 15.

If you dont want to go, then you dont have to go!!!
gXBPLitzaa	She might be mad at first but will understand.<br>  But it shouldnt be brought up to the little girl unless she asks first that could be very hard for a young girl to understand.|`|AA10651000	Under no circumstances should you burden your child with your bad choices of having multiple sleeping partners simultaneously. <br>  <br>  The only thing you need to be concerned about is your daughter and her well being and self esteem. <br>  <br>  Kids don't understand the whole where babies come from until they are older. <br>  <br>  I would tell my daughter that I wanted a baby, and prayed and prayed, and God blessed me with her. That will work for a while. If she asks about a daddy, just say she doesn't have one. I mean you could have gotten a sperm donor, or adopted her, right? I would stick with the anonymous sperm donor story. That makes it look like you wanted your daughter so bad. She will think highly of you, instead of thinking that you showed immoral behavior.<br>  <br>  The only thing your daughter needs to know is that you love her, you wanted her from the start, and that she is the best thing that has ever happened to you.<br>  <br>  I have two adopted kids. They know they were adopted from birth. And they are healthy, happy and well adjusted. If they ask about thier birth parents, I say I don't know, but that I am so happy that God chose to make our family in the way that He did.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I would feel my mom is a ****, but still love my mom and learn from her mistake.
AA11530601	wow your situation is pretty similar to how mine was too growing up, right down to your dad spending the mortgage on booze. - we are in debt and he blames my mum - but my mum only took out the loans to cover bills (her wage isnt high enough alone to do that, although she works, its low paid).  All I can say is hold on, it does get better as you get older. x|`|WnbutJsuaa	It`s not your fault, u have everything a parent would want and if he can`t see that than he`s the one who`s not good enough to be your father! e-mail me if u want to talk...<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|f849fe6f1344072ff248076d8c5de5a4aa	Just a thought, and sorry to go all jeremy kyle on you, but as he seems to favour your sister so much, is there any chance that he's unsure whether or not he's your real father?|`|nfzQkvqraa	I love my daughter just because she is mine.  I don't look for anything in a daughter.  Having a relationship with your child isn't like going on  a shopping spree.  However your father is feeling, and whatever he's doing is NOT YOUR FAULT.  There is absolutely nothing you could have done to him at the age of 15 that would make him not love you.  He's having issues and they're not your issues. They are all his.  Just stay strong and it will eventually work itself out in the end.|`|pLacTaMPaa	A very well-behaved princess who's only found attractive to perfect specimens of the oppostite sex and only after a full education for both & with excellent grades - someone who I'm not just proud of, but genuinely feel I've passed on something I wish I found in myself...<br>    ...Well, maybe the odd eccentricity - like ironing the flannels or walking around the house with the cat stood on her shoulder....<br>  <br>    But no wild parties!  Get your own place and trash it.<br>  <br>  Well - I'm sure any dad would say his daughter's an angel - but I do not suppose it would harm to actually expect it in advance of fathering a daughter, as the prerequisite for it becoming so, you understand.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	hunny, youre supposed to love your children unconditionally, dont you even think about changing who you are to make him "love" you , it wouldnt work anyway.its always sickening when  an "adult" plays favorites, but theres really not alot you can do to make him "like" you any more,  hes  just a sorry excuse for a human being.
3zxVzPBxaa	its not normal to bleed during ovulation, you might get a stretchy type of vaginal discharge but no blood. Maybe you're preggo, or maybe you spotted a little from sex... you should do some research on reasons why women spot.. it might help you out.<br>  <br>  btw, i liked how you said babydancing...haha|`|oiJITSNZaa	bleeding has nothing to do wiht ovulating...maybe if you have been having a lot of sex lately, something could be irritated and thus bleeding|`|AA12384088	If you are babydancing a lot it could be just irritation.<br>  Best of luck .

Sperm can live inside you for up to 6 days, but it depends on the swimmers as to whether or not its a full six days.<br>  <br>  Anyways, we went through a few of those tests before getting pregnant this time around and the time it worked for us was to do the baby dance every other day up until the positive test, then everyday. I hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

TrBoPj92aa	Good luck at the pediatricains she will probably recommend a different routine for lennox so he can get more nutrients into his boys, its normal for babies to loose a few oz's maybe 1lb but i think 4lbs is too much .If she says its nothing to worry about then try feeding him a little more, it will be hard on you but hopefully when you get his weight back up to around 9lbs then you could stop that.<br>  <br>  Another reason she might say don't worry it because 10lbs 3oz is massive! My daughters were born at 5lbs 3oz + 4lbs 9oz and my 10days they were 5lbs 5oz + 5lbs so Lennox isn't too small.<br>  <br>  Don't worry + see what the pediatrician says<br>  good luck xox|`|iMaTMWMxaa	My eldest daughter was 9lb exactly when born. Her weight went down to 7lb 7oz within the 1st week. It still went down more, but not by 4lb.<br>  <br>  The paediatrician said that as she was 11 days overdue her weight was just settling. But she also had "floppy larynx" which meant she was using a lot of energy to breathe. She grew out of this by 6 months, and is otherwise healthy.<br>  <br>  However, 4lbs is such a lot. I would take him to the doctors. Always better to check.|`|dwdvBVWuaa	It is normal for babies to loose maybe a pound or two but not 4lbs. Is he nursing o.k. and keeping his milk down. It probably is nothing but I would definatly have him checked out. Doesn't the baby have a 4 or 6 week check up with his pediatrician soon or just call the doctors office and ask the nurse if this is normal.|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	I would take him to a doctor as soon as possible.<br>  A small amount of weight loss is normal in the first few days after birth but to lose 4Ibs in 10 days just is not right.<br>  <br>  I am sure everything is fine but I would just take him for a check up anyway to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|DvWGTzLUaa	In the UK I believe the threshold for weight loss is 10% of birth weight... Any more than that and they would worry. My daughter was born 8lb 14oz and dropped to 7lbs 12oz at her lowest and they were getting concerned then. I'd def get him checked by a doc!|`|Y0FSVQtraa	Its usually normal when a baby loses pounds from when he was born. But just in case you should probably contact a docter.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	They do lose weight, but that's an awful lot to lose.  I'd talk to someone else.  He may not be getting enough to eat.  I've never heard of a baby losing that much, and it not being a problem.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Babies normally do lose a couple ounces, but I've never heard of losing four pounds and that being considered normal. If he's eating well, pooping and peeing a lot, that's a good sign, but I would get him checked by the pediatrician as soon as you can. Steady weight loss is usually a red flag to most doctors and I can't see how losing that much is considered okay. But continue nursing him and see what happens - how frequently does he eat? I find it puzzling that he would eat so well and yet lose so much. You might have to go in for regular weight checks at the doctor's, and if he continues to lose weight, be prepared for them to suggest you put him on formula. <br>  <br>  Just to be on the safe side - take him in to the ped's office!|`|rTAvnldfaa	that does seem an awful lot to lose in such a short time. my little boy was 9lb 6oz born and he went down to 8lb 13oz and my midwife said that was quite a lot so im very suprised theryre not looking into this. id get a second opinion. they say 10% loss is an acceptable level but this is way over? try gp or ask for another midwife, good luck x|`|NQQaoG8Oaa	that sounds a bit worrying seems like too much weight is being lost. i would take him to the docs and express your concerns|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Umm i would say the weight loss would of stopped by now. Take him to a real doctor.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	He needs to see the doctor.  That's NOT normal!

4a66d12ad0952e5ec7eb7656964ff567aa	Ok - I can understand that as I fed my kids myself and really loved doing it.  Try expressing the milk - beg steal or borrow a breast pump.  Fill the bottle with your milk and try her with it.  That way you will know whether its the breast or the milk.  By expressing your milk you will help keep your milk production up (sorry - it makes you sound like a prize cow at an agricultural fair!).  If she doesn't want your milk in a bottle try her on formula.  Try to figure out what it is that she doesn't like, because she is indeed trying to tell you something.  Could it be that you have eaten something that could have given a funny taste to your milk?  Anything unusual, or spicy?  Also does she have a tummy problem?  That could be the reason if she refuses everything.  If so, take her to see the doctor who'll get it sorted out.  If you are miserable she'll feel it and be miserable too.  So don't let it get you down!  I'm sure that she loves breastfeeding too. <br>  <br>  Take care!|`|vh7ykvmHaa	I've had exactly the same situation as you!! I went to a breast feeding clinic. It turns out he has tounge-tie and he struggles sucking. He has now been refered to a peadatrtion to check it out. I would suggest checking out if you have a breastfeeding clinic around so they can watch you try. Also I found after him refusing if I just rested my nipple a little in his lips he has now latched on??! Strange. Have you tried a nipple shield?|`|4WIXuugcaa	You are obviously at your wits end  and feeling very stressed.Have you changed your diet at all? Some strong tasting foods can affect the taste of breast milk and can seem unpleasant to the baby. Ask your health visitor for a list of foods. i hope that it is something as simple as this.|`|0ILy1p3taa	She is prefering the bottle b/c the breast feels differently and probably b/c the bottle delivers the milk faster.  Timing how long a baby eats at the breast is setting the baby up for problems.  By doing this, the baby doesn't get to drink the heavier, fatter and more filling hindmilk.  By allowing the baby to stay at the breast for as long as he or she decides increases the amount of milk that the baby will get and the amount of hindmilk. Babies can take as long as 45 minutes for finish a feed, but the *AVERAGE* is 20-30 minutes.  It also depends on how efficient the baby is at emptying the breast.<br>  <br>  Here's a thought: Work with your baby at the breast BEFORE she gets super hungry. This way she isn't starving or getting frustrated b/c your milk hasn't letdown yet and she want milk NOW!  Another idea, manually express or pump or stimulate your nipples to get a letdown so that when you go to put the breast to the baby milk is readily available - like milk in a bottle is.<br>  <br>  Another thought: As you gradually increase the amount of time the baby feeds at the breast, gradually decrease the amount of formula you put in the bottle.  The more you feed from the bottle, the less milk you are telling your body to make - thus leaving your baby still hungry after a feeding at the breast.<br>  <br>  *I* practice nursing on demand, so my babies are never limited to how often they feed or for how long - not saying that you limit how often to feed.  At 4 months old, my exclusively breastfed baby was eating every 1.5 - 2.5 hours around the clock.  Since breastmilk is more properly digested and easier on the baby's digestive system to digest. I knew that this was normal.  <br>  <br>  My DD was born 6# 12oz and by 4 months she weighed 14# 12.8oz. My DS was born 7# 10oz and by 4 months he weighed 14# 4.3oz.  Breastfeed babies gain weight COMPLETELY different than formula fed babies. Most doctors go by the formula fed baby growth chart rather than the one that the WHO put out for breastfed babies.  Both of were/is breastfed on demand and nursed until they popped off - no bottles.  Nursing on demand has shown to promote healthy weight gain in babies and adequate milk supply for moms.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry that things are getting rough for you and that you are having to decide between giving a bottle of formula and re-establishing the breastfeeding realtionship you had.  Formula is not an equivalent of breastmilk, BUT it will help your baby grow, minus all the immunological aspects that come with breastmilk. Breastmilk is a LIVE substance.  Formula is not live, by any means and it comes with an increased risk in obesity, diabetes, illnesses and recall by the manufacturer b/c of inadequate nutrients or contamination.|`|qtCVLDFxaa	Hi !<br>  This is probably what is known as a breast-feeding strike. The site below is a great source of information ! It happened to me after I was out of town for a week-end, away from my then-3-month old and I was practically desperate. <br>  <br>  I would advise you to consult a lactation consultant for support and information. If you intend to keep breast-feeding, then you will have to express (hand or pump) your milk until the situation returns to normal, or you will lose your supply. <br>  <br>  What worked for me was a long bath for both of us, nice and relaxed then getting her latched on half asleep. Try not to wait until she is starving and hysterical, if it escalates into the third world war it will not be resolved easily. You might try using a cup (a shooter glass works great) instead of a bottle if you have to give her formula for nutrition. You prop her up and feed her small sips at a time. Also turn off the TV, dim the lights etc so there are no distractions. Babies this age are very aware and discovering the world around them.<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|oXIYHsDaaa	it's much easier to drink from the bottle so you might want to try using a newborn nipple so she has to work harder and just keep trying, in the mean time pump your milk if she wont nurse so your supply doesn't go down and you can offer the breast milk in the bottle, don't give up it could just be a nursing strike which is very normal for a lot of babies.<br>  <br>  if you haven't had much lot expressing, try a plain old medella spring express manual pump (about $15) it is my favorite pump and I've tried the advent and the expensive hospital ones too.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	What kind of nipple are you using?  She gets the formula out of the bottle faster than the breast milk.  Maybe find a nipple with a smaller hole, or give her a couple of sips, take it away, then a couple sips, and so on.  She may have gotten used to getting satisfied with the bottle, as she can drink it faster.|`|erKyfwSbaa	Well, unfortunately it is much easier for the baby to suck on the bottle. It's instant gratification. My son was about 5 months when he stopped wanting to breastfeed :(.<br>  <br>  It's also possible that she is beginning to teeth and her mouth hurts. Keep trying. Try not to force her, just gently keep offering. She can sense your stress, and it might be stressing her out too.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Did you coat your nipples with breastmilk to encourage a latch?  That is one thing I was told to do to encourage my son when we visited lactation consultants.|`|JHQiIl34aa	My daughter refused the bottle at 4 days! old. I completely broke down and if i hadn't had my partners support i would probably of gone to depression. She is bottle fed now, i tried expressing which worked well but i had a lot pain so she is purely formula now. She is a very healthy and 3 month old. I'm obviously upset about it still but also glad that she at least had the colostrum and is happy. <br>  I would express. Im afraid i can't see her going back as a bottle is easier for a baby, but try asking a midwife or doc for help.|`|eY8b5fBRaa	if you tip a bottle upsidedown it will leak out, your breast don't (unless your "letting down") and because of that your baby don't have to work to get milk from a bottle like he does the breast. He's bottle spoiled. But that can be fixed! 1st I would try to kinda squeeze on your breast a little while he's b/fing so he knows there IS milk in there. If that don't work, get a sns. The lactation lady at the wic office gave me one free and it works! You put some milk in a little bottle thing, hook it on top part of your bra and a small tube runs down your chest to your nipple and into baby mouth so he's not working so hard to get milk and learns that there in milk in there. Not b/fing may have lowered the amount of milk you have too so you might want to get some fenugreek pills to get your milk going strong again... I use itand it's great!
4t6ABZcfaa	I NEVER take my daughters phone away what if there was an emergency and she needed to call me or the police? do I want her to worry about finding a payphone or depending on someone else to have a cell phone- my number one rule is don't leave the house without a cellphone. As long as she pays for her texting I don't care what she does.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	I will answer the parents portion: When I was a teen I never did anything stupid enough to have my phone taken away. If it were to be taken away, I would have no bothered with it and just gave it away. I had nothing to hide. It is crazy the sense of entitlement that teens have. Anyway.....<br>  <br>  1. I would just take it away. Unless there is reason to be suspicious I never intend to go through my children's property. <br>  2. I would then become suspicious and turn it on and inspect it.<br>  3. I would unlock it. Or force my child, while watching to make sure nothing gets deleted, to unlock it<br>  4. I would find the deleted messages. Yes, even though you delete them from the phone does not mean that they are gone completely. If not phone privileges would be gone until 18 and/or moved out of the house. (Technology does change.) <br>  5.  I would intercept messages if my child deletes everything and I can not retrieve the deleted messages. I do not plan on doing anything like this unless my children show me a reason to. This includes, the beginning of failing grades in school, strange behavior, and shutting the phone off before handing it to me after asking for it. <br>  <br>  My kids will not have a stupid phone anyway. (Having a phone before 16 is what is outrageous.) I did without and so can they. If they do get a phone before they can pay for it themselves, it will only be able to call 911 and me and their dad. If they unlock that, they lose the phone. There are payphones, they can carry change if there is a reason to call.|`|Fu7OK54kaa	1. I don't get my phone taken away (ooh miss goody-two shoes!)<br>  2. If I were to, I probably wouldn't think and just hand it over (or 'forget' to have it with me and 'lose' it Lol)<br>  3. Nope, I'd forget<br>  4. Last time I'd tried to lock it we had to buy a new SIM<br>  5. My mum wouldn't look through my messages - my dad did once behind my back and got my mums number so he could scream at her. Two wrong moves (we haven't talked in 3-4 months lol)<br>  6. I'd be really angry and fleeeep-out<br>  7. I don't like it, if they can't be trusted why do they have a phone in the first place?|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Her parents were smart.If I had been your parent I would have just went and got another battery and hammer.After viewing your files,(even if it meant going to the phone company to do it) I would have used the hammer on your phone.That would have been the end of your cell phone until you were 18.<br>  Parents have EVERY right to know what their minor children are doing because the PARENTS are responsible for what they do and what happens to them.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	My son is not old enough for a phone but if I ever do have to take it I probably wouldn't shut it off. I also wouldn't go through their stuff unless I had a reason(possible drug use etc etc). But as worried as you are then you shouldn't keep things on your phone you don't want anyone to see. What if it was stolen? Or lost? And you don't know that they actually went through it do you?|`|HWeajklaaa	Well there has to be areason she got it taken away.

wiAVa1H5aa	The cause is most often anatomy, babies have tubes that link to their sinuses that are straight to them, adults have their connection angled down preventing bacteria from getting up there.   Some anatomies are more prone to ear infections then others, and usually some babies have a parent who got a lot of infections.<br>  <br>  Tubes in the ears is just a microscopic tube inserted in the ear drum that equalizes pressure so that when infection is growing it doesn't break the ear drum.   It would have benefited my husband, he has partial hearing loss from the multitude of ear infections he got as a toddler, and there is a lot of scarring on his ear drum.|`|aY5vHbPLaa	There are many factors that may cause ear infections.<br>  Just take some measures to help prevent them.<br>  # 1 rule is do not let anyone smoke around your baby, for this is a leading cause of an ear infection.<br>  # 2 Never lay your baby down with his bottle, laying flat when feeding causes ear infections. I will let you look that one up. Either hold him or prop his pillows so he is not laying flat. I recommend holding him so you don't lose that precious bonding time that is so critical at this age.

eytlIKITaa	I hear you!  Husband and I have been TTC, this will be our 10th cycle... I'm still waiting on AF this month...  We're both young and healthy too.  I've stopped stressing about it, although I can't help but constantly think about it.  And throughout this whole process I've learned so much about my body, stuff I feel I should have already known.  And not to sound ridiculously religious, but, I've given it up to God- He'll decide when it's suppose to happen.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Relax, have fun trying!  Lots and lots of baby dust to us!|`|I1eNscocaa	my advice is just to keep doing what you are doing now and keep your hope up! ive been trying for 8 months now with no results and i know it can seem like it will never happen! its hard stay positive.  just try make sex fun and maby think about using pre seed to help the little swimmers along.|`|yp9rEMSraa	I know the frustration....At least now your doctor says you are fine, so you can rule out that anything is wrong with you....Has your husband had his sperm count checked?  You can buy over the counter test to do this...they are a lot cheaper and the privacy is better lol....Im 28 and my husband is 34 trying to conceive our first with no luck....i went to an ovulation website and found some great sites that gives you days you are going to ovulate...they have not work for me though so i started charting by basal temp but have heard it is really hard to figure out exactly when to TTC.....they have ovulation test kits at the store which are pretty cheap also...basically you pee on the stick and it will tell you whether you are ovulating or not (which this is the best time to have sex).....I decided to get a fertility monitor this month....it is the same jist as the ovulation pee sticks but it records your periods and allows you to keep a record that can be printed up and given to your doctor in 6 months....if your periods are not normal then this might be some of your problem also...not knowing and guessing could have you guys just missing by a few days here and there....Don't give up and don't get frustrated...there are a lot of women that are going through and feeling everything you are feeling right now...you are not alone...just keep trying and i hope that you become a mommy soon....Lots of baby dust your way|`|AA11251271	I would make an appt with a specialist.  Even though your doc said nothing is wrong seeing a specialist may show something else or it may confirm her theory and put your mind at ease.  That would help you to relax and increase your chances of success.  <br>  <br>  BABY DUST ~~~~~|`|AA10961212	I would advise charting you BBT (Basal Body Temperature) to see when you ovulate. <br>  Below are 2 websites that I think will be useful. And DON'T GIVE UP!

I have started drinking an herbal tea by Yogi Tea for women's reproductive health, taking prenatal vitamins and just started tracking my LH surges with an ovulation predictor kits.  They are relatively inexpensive and are supposed to be pretty accurate.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay positive, it is the standard of care to have been actively trying for 12 months before you are considered to have a fertility issue.|`|DxdAyTp5aa	relax hun your fine, your body is not ready yet when your time comes you will have your baby. relax and still enjoy this time you have making the baby. and good luck p.s if your dr didnt recomend any tests your fine|`|jdRJkvcpaa	There's a great doctor in California who will implant you with 8 embryos.|`|7zNUVSTRaa	what is ttc ? oh trying to conceive........
z95q94qUaa	Babe Im so sorry your mother is not the understanding type but the longer you hide your pregnancy from your mother the worse it will be when you tell her. Like mentioned above she cant make you get an abortion it is your body. And you should really see a doctor as soon as possible after finding out your pregnant because you are putting your life and your babies at risk by not going for your first visit to make sure everything's ok with you both. Just try to think of a way to tell her whether it be face to face, over the phone, write a lettler anyway that makes it a little easier.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	You are the weird one saving blood soaked rags. Why would a 16 yo want a child in the first place?|`|xnhwmontaa	Ok your sixteen and you got pregnant on purpose maybe you should just your mother and stop being such a wimp. Don't say you didn't get pregnant on purpose because you posted a question asking how to make your birth control ineffective so you could have a baby. and you said you weren't a teenager but clearly in this question you are a teenager. I suggest you just come clean with your mother, I would be so sad if I was your mother because she tried to make you take birth control!<br>  Just wait soon after the baby comes and you can't do anything but be a mom and school you'll see your error. Good Luck to you its not easy...|`|8j7FCEOraa	Well. Your not going to be able to hide it forever. Maybe you should visit a centre, most cities have programs for safe sex and pregnancies like yours. I am sure they would be more then willing to help you and to help talk to your mom.|`|AA11510511	Well you can't do this for the whole 9 months.  You will start to show from anything between 4-5 months.<br>  <br>  Tell her straight away.  She can not force you to have an abortion.|`|ixHwF4apaa	donot keep it pending, tell her(mum). or else they will definitly find it out of their own, by your activities. and decide further, it is too young to deliver a child. think it over|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	um you need to see a doctor to get on the right prenatal vitamins and to rule out anything bad like an ectopic pregnancy, which if it goes wrong can kill you and the baby.  please be responsible and go see a doctor.  <br>  <br>  if you think your mother would try to do that (she sounds pretty loony, asking you to "show" her that you had your period and all) but you could always go to a family friend, the father's parents, or a counselor at school.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	You can't hide your pregnancy.. You need to be seeing a doctor and unless your mom takes you, how are you going to get there? Also, what does your mom do? Ask to see your bloody napkins?! I mean why would you have to show her that anyways?! Also, don't you think she's going to be even MORE pissed when you tell you're you're pregnant and you're already 3 1/2 - 4 months along!?|`|98WKYtfwaa	Does she actually want to check your pads/tampons to make sure you have a period? <br>  <br>  I don't think keeping used sanitarys is hygenic. <br>  <br>  She can't force you to abort, you actually might be surprised by her reaction, she might be happy or at least supportive of what you want to do. Tell her, it's best she knows now.|`|1qnbvUYPaa	At the end of the day its YOUR baby. She can't "make" you abort it. If you feel she will force you into it, confine in another adult you trust (older sibling, relative, teacher, etc.) The sooner you tell her however the better things will be. Are you ready to be a mother? Have you considered adoption? If you feel your not ready to be a mom don't do it to yourself or the baby. Just talk to your mom, you'll see things will work out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|C9QQPROkaa	That's not a good thing to do you need tell your mom. And if she doesn't want you to keep the baby that's all it is she cannot force you to get an abortion no one can. Now if you don't have anyone that's going to support you in this please consider adoption there are different kinds, open adoptions, private adoptions etc You cant keep hiding it eventually she will know.|`|3HSOymkPaa	no one can make u have an abortion.. even if ur mom takes u to the abortion clinic they ask you if you really want this and all u have to do is say no and they wont let you do it no matter what your mom says but please dont be so discusting and keeps those lol :P just tell her straight you are having a baby and your happy about it <br>  good luck and congrats on your creation of life xx|`|rctDnhO1aa	i think you should put it up for adoption, just looking at your pic makes me feel like this wont be the first time that this happens|`|pC1H7kO4aa	Saving used tampons?<br>  EW.<br>  Just tell her about it!|`|HjLQDxFhaa	Would your mother be looking for stuff from your period? And what is your plan....to keep the baby or give her up for adoption? What is the point of hiding it for just two periods? I think you need to have a sit down talk with your mother and when you do know what you want out of the conversation, but also remember she is your mother and does have a say in what you should do. So ask her advice, if you talk to her like a grown up you might be surprised. But who knows?|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	As hard as it may sound, you really need to tell your mum. she will be more annoyed if she finds out her own daughter has lied to her, than if u tell her the truth in the first place. <br>  <br>  Regardless of what your mum wants, its your choice about whether you want to abort or not. your body, your life, your choice. xx|`|3hBQz33Yaa	She will eventually find out and know that you've been hiding and lying to her about it which will more than likely make her even more upset when she finds out. You really need to be upfront and honest with her now. Explain to her that you know you messed up but you do not want an abortion and that you really need her support.|`|NLpTYyQTaa	Hi, umm..im not a female, however, i think that "Hiding" your pregnancy might not be such a great idea..the sooner you tell them the longer they have to handle and cope with the situation...you can't keep it a secret for long, because eventually they HAVE to find out.|`|paze8XoXaa	Hiding a illness or snything like that is bad. Hiding a PREGNACY! is even worse. you are only 16 sweetie and you need to tell your mom that u r pregnet and u dont wat an abortain. she has been through it...she can take you to a doctor and that is more hearlthy for u and ur child....<br>  hope it helped|`|070af3f15b926093c69b44f51816ba38aa	what do you mean by she won't understand? like she won't find out? if it is that then she'll eventually find out, Unless something goes wrong. Maybe you should tell her now so she knows whats coming then to just hit her in the head when the baby comes|`|oQ5oKILHaa	It is much more irresponsible to deny your unborn baby prenatal care than to just admit to your weirdo mama that you are pregnant. Everyone gots some crazy parents. <br>  <br>  And that sounds super unsanitary to keep anything from an old period.|`|aDSuIzuoaa	she cant tell you whether or not you have to abort your baby. you should try to find a help service in your area to help you and support you in your choices. Look up pregnancy help in your area!|`|4Ijc5NIJaa	Just tell your mom the situation. Explain it to her! The last thing you want to do is let her know through your periods. She'll never respect you unless you tell her to her face.|`|GLkXBlOkaa	I would advice you to tell your mum<br>  <br>  Also I dnt believe in abortion its murder!<br>  <br>  You are 16 and are old enough to make your own decisions<br>  <br>  Just tell your mum that you want to keep the baby<br>  <br>  xx|`|g5wQNUKGaa	Just tell her she is gonna find out in 3 months and will be pissed that you did not tell her earlier! So tell her...|`|K2dodrKLaa	I wouldnt keep them thats kinda gross.. just tell her your pregnant and ur not having an abortion its your body your right|`|uwQhrk39aa	you did this to yourself....sorry to tell ya dat...|`|AA11462461	Tell you mom....She will give you best suggestion....trust on her.....
MHOxPs8Oaa	Wow that's pretty rude. Well hey don't let them have the satisfaction that it bugged you. Just don't associating with them as much as you can now, because what they did is bull crap.|`|im3vWyv6aa	I agree with *smile*... kill them with kindness. You had a GREAT party. I know exactly what it's like to deal with co-workers. Blaaahhh!<br>  <br>  ADD: I love 2275c comment on the "double goodie bags to the kids that came" - that is brilliant!<br>  <br>  Best wishes...<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|j2mRop0laa	When you go to work have a huge smile on your face and hold your head high. Don't even mention the party. When they mention it and say sorry they couldn't be there and ask how it went.. just go on and on about how great it was.. you almost forgot they were invited (have a little laugh here) and too bad they missed it! The kids had an absolute blast. Just brag on and on.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Did you sent an invitation to the kids house via mail or did you do it verbally?  Kids have very short memories and attention spans.  Just chalk it up for experience.  As far as the goodie bags, give them to a children's hospital, they will appreciate them.  Next time, don't invite anyone unless you are positively sure they will show up.  It is called RSVP via written response!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Oh that is terrible. I'm so sorry for you. I remember when I planned a huge slumber party and a bunch of girls were supposed to come, no one showed and my mom had wasted time and money on setting up a big snack area. It's just heartbreaking. I'm so sorry you and your daughter had to go through that.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	That was very rude, and demanding goodie bags! How distasteful can someone get? Look at it this way, if your daughter has any parties coming up for school, you'll have to make less for the class. Next time I wouldn't invite them.|`|10LIhgtkaa	OMGosh, I would be livid. Definitely donate those goodie bags, maybe to a women's shelter. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't go much for revenge, but this time I would so do it. I would brag about how great the party was and how glad you are that those people didn't show up because that would have just ruined it. Let them know it was a huge hit for the simple fact that they weren't there.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't invite those losers to anything!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I wouldnt say a word to them - no apology is going to take away their rudeness.  If they bring up the party, I'd just laugh and say 'oh the kids had a great time!'  and if they do apologize, just say 'oh no problem, the kids got double goody bags - they loved it!!"<br>  <br>  sorry you work with people like that.  at least you know their true colors now.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Really rude. Kids are cruel too, my 12th birthday I invited these two girls that never showed up, or mentioned it at school afterward. We waited for them for like an hour before ordering the pizzas.<br>  <br>  On my brothers 12th birthday, he invited his entire grade, no one showed up. He spent the night in the bathroom crying.<br>  <br>  People suck.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I would tell them to get well and truly fu*ked!!<br>  They can go without goodie bags if they didn't have the manners to ring and tell you they couldnt come!!!!<br>  I would be soo freakin angry, dont give into them.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Well next time just invite the ones who showed up hon.Save the goodie bags for another occassion.|`|0xGm3lrxaa	Those parents sound very selfish. They are so rude. Don't do goodie bags.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Holy, I would be furious! Some people can be so self involved.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	When they demanded goodie bags, I would have told them never mind.  <br>  <br>  I always let someone know if we can or can not make it, and if plans change I tell them.  I understand your frustration, because it has happened to me, too.  I actually do not think it is that uncommon-some people just have no couth.<br>  <br>  I am glad that some people still came to your daughter's party.  You did not mention how old she was, but had it not worked out you could have done something like a picnic at the park or Chuck E Cheese or whatever, to make it special.  Something to keep in mind in the future!<br>  <br>  Happy Birthday to your daughter!  Sorry about the way things turned out...|`|kjcgnxbOaa	I had a party once for my sons that none of their classmates showed up for. If my DD hadn't gotten 2 friends to come they'd have had no one. DD's parties have usually been a bust as well, couldn't get more than 2 out of 15 girls invited to show. I didn't send her on the five day school trip with them, figured I didn't need to spend $300 for her to be with a bunch who couldn't even be bothered to RSVP. Do not invite these people again.|`|wEMlgh6Taa	It's almost like in this fast paced world we live in, that it is ok to Not have manners. Seems like everyone is so involved in their own life, they don't have time for anyone else. I would NOT give them the satisfaction of knowing how bad it hurt you or your child.  Maybe next time, if there is a next time, you might want to call everyone you invited the night before just to do a head count (most people don't RSVP anyway anymore).That way if they are not coming, you still have time to make other plans for her special day.I don't think they hate you, I think they are just self absorbed, and have lost their manners somewhere along the way. Be proud, you are blessed with a wonderful daughter, and remember...revenge is not the answer- you still have to work with these people. Happy Birthday to your special little girl!  :)

Either way you can't go wrong !|`|hnfOU634aa	Braden/Brayden however you spell it is soooo trendy.  I dislike it in general but the number of Braden/Aiden/Caden/Jaden's (with all of their 'unique' spellings included) out there is mind numbing.  <br>  Keegan is in the same boat but I do like that name.|`|pPj2eN2taa	brayden is really nice, i dont like keagan. a good middle name for brayden is Lindon|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	Both Suck|`|RFQn766Taa	I'm sorry... but I don't like either
eu6UQElYaa	I have both but like the exersaucer better.  They could exercise their little legs in it, move all around, jump up and down and be entertained by the little toys on the side.   With the jumperoo all they could really do was bounce up and down.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	We have both, but our daughter has never been interested in the jumperoo. She loves her exersaucer, if I let her...she'd probably spend hours in it. She gets 10 minutes here and there and has a blast in it.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	get both give her some varitery|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Both!<br>  <br>  I'd recommend a Jolly Jumper with the frame. It has to be the best toy ever invented! A baby can usually use a Jolly Jumper and have a little baby party at about 4 months.<br>  <br>  An exersaucer is better when the baby is a bit older (usually 5 months or so). I say a bit older, because when babies are floppy, they tend to smack their little faces on the saucer's toys.<br>  <br>  Have fun shopping!<br>  <br>  (by the way, you can often get really nice exersaucers at pre-owned stores - it's nice that way too, because you need a Masters in Engineering to put some of the newer ones together, so they're already assembled!).<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  A walker might work for you when the baby is even older - 7 months or so. And, if the baby is tall enough to reach the floor when in the walker, and if you have enough room and safe room for it (stairs are a big concern). Our son loves his walker, but he couldn't reach until 7 months and he is a tall guy!|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	i like both of them but i have hard a lot of bad stuff about Jumperoo. like kids can fall out of them cause they can push there weight forward and it can flip over. ExerSaucer  are nice cause you don't have to worry about them going any were.but if u have the money you can get both. but i like the Exersaucer better. i never had a Jumperoo all i had was a exersaucer. i dont think they even had the exersaucer out when my daughter was little.|`|qq1q0NEpaa	My daughter LOVED her exersaucer.  She spent a lot of time in it and never got bored.  With my son, we were given a Jumper-oo which he loves.  But he gets kind of bored with it cause it doesn't have as many toys.  So we are trying to get him an Exersaucer too.  So he will have both :)|`|deIzFnV8aa	We like the jumperoo a lot, or rather, our DD does. I don't see how it could possibly tip over, since it only hangs from the door frame, but I do see how people could worry about it falling off the frame (though actually it would be nearly impossible  for this to happen, I think, considering the way it clamps on.) A big factor for us was space - a jumperoo is very compact, easy to take down and store, and easy to take with us on trips.  We just don't have the room for a bulky exersaucer. Of course, since the jumperoo hangs in a doorway, I usually end up having to take it down at teh end of each use, but it is easy enough to do that I can even manage that with one hand.<br>  <br>  Just to throw it out there, our dr recommends exersaucers since the baby doesn't tilt forward as much when bouncing. She also says babies aren't ready for jumperoos until 6 months or when they can sit by themselves (to have sufficient back muscles), and that she never recommends walkers because they tip fairly easily.|`|B2gdBCBbaa	I would look at the excersaucer, because I have heard many times that babies put all their weight toward the front or back, and flipped. But, I would rather get a walker.|`|7NsBWQZtaa	then get a walker ;)
oKiW2JwNaa	we got ours from B&Q and i've also seen them in staples. i'm in the uk but i think there's b&q in ireland... not sure about staples but it's basically a large stationary shop where you get everything from desks to pens.|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	you can probably order them online somewhere.. also..because i was afraid adhesive locks would get pried off without my knowing and i am also renting i put an adhesive alarm on the cabinet door(the pic said it was for windows or soemthing but it works) if the door s opened it lets out a piercing alarm definate deterrant and i know my daughter wont be drinking poison|`|3inMiq8Jaa	Depends on what stores you have out there........Wal-Mart and baby's R Us have them.....any retail store and grocery store shoul dhave them. If not then go to a hardware store or a Home Depot or Lowes if you have those. If you have no luck with that, ask other parents or even a hospital or osmething, they should know. Good Luck.
VGoo84T7aa	I've gone at all times of the day to check my follicles. Now if you do an IUI they do that in the morning (usually)....good luck. And baby dust!!|`|QwOcjwSIaa	I am seeing an infertility specialist right now and he does all testing early in the am between 7 and 8. I also am on clomid and he measures my follicles in the morning so I would think it is better. Good luck.|`|AA11251271	NO......some offices prefer am appointments however.  The time of the day does not make a difference but I have been seeing a specialist for 7 months now and they make all ultrasound appts. in the am b/c I also get blood work done at the same time and the lab collects the blood around 11am.  My doc likes to review the blood work along with the ultrasound pics so during the am appt he does not have much to say about the progress but around 4 pm I'll get a call from him after the blood test results are back and he has reviewed them together.<br>  <br>  Baby Dust|`|oiJITSNZaa	shouldn't make any difference.
6hewStZ7aa	It's usually brownish-red in color and very very light.  It may be implantation bleeding, but then again it may not be. You're best bet is to take a pregnancy test to be sure.
C7Ujon3Xaa	If your friends' parents know than it won't be long before your parents get to know. And they would prefer hearing it from you than from anybodyelse.<br>  I agree with squeaker that you should use the word boyfriend and not dating because dating implies that you could be with one boy on one day and with another one the next day and many parents do not reconcile to this fact.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Just ask if he can come round. Then keep inviting him over. They'll soon figure it out.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|AA11296427	Aaaw, you're 14.

Would you like to meet him?"<br>  <br>  I would not use the word dating. That sounds like you're going out at night and kissing, etc and even if you are, if you never talk about this stuff with your parents and don't know how they'll react, don't say it.<br>  <br>  If you offer for them to meet him, they should appreciate it and think of it as very grown up of you. Maybe even suggest that his parents are nice and maybe your parents would like to meet his parents? Then your parents know it's ok with his family so they should be too. Good luck, hope all goes well! =)|`|RuCvsLcoaa	hey,you are a teenager so no problem to have a boy friend but don't go to a more serious relationship i mean avoid sex, tell your parents about him so they will know you are dating and that shows you respect them you tell them what happening to you now,with or without reactions at least they know.|`|5ljmL3hsaa	I am having EXACTLY the same problem haha.<br>  Except my mum accidentally caught us kissing :|.<br>  <br>  not fun.<br>  :L|`|P0bWaKoNaa	You should be able to tell your parents anything, even when it comes to boys, it may seem really embarrassing but they will understand. They were your age once, so they probably know how you feel from past experience. It is much better to tell you parents yourself than have them find out. <br>  <br>  They wouldn't shout at you for having a boyfriend, it shows that you are growing up.|`|Vl7a32FTaa	just relax...<br>  <br>  talk to your parents about dating for a while...<br>  <br>  then when they ask you calmly if you dated sum1, then that's the tym u tell them the truth..
u9sGH0AXaa	You don't necesarily "get" anything, but a 1,000 credit.  That does not mean your refund will be that much.  It depends on your w2's and federal taxes for the year,|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Same as you get if the child were born on 1/1/08.  You get credit for the whole year no matter when in the year the child was born.  <br>  You kind of make it sound like this isn't true.  If that's the case, it would not be a good idea to put it on your tax return.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I don't know the exact amount you will recieve, but I do know that you will get the same amount as you would if they were born 1-1-08.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	um, what? what exactly are you asking?|`|AA10836047	$1,000 for every dependent

f47HTHOkaa	You can find out at 16 weeks but most doctors order scans around 20 weeks. Since it is your first visit they will draw blood, ask if you want the quad blood test (check for risk of downs), do a belly check which means they will measuer your belly, get the heart rate and see if you have any questions or concerns. They will also check weight and blood pressure oh and your urine for portien. They may also give you a scrip for prenatal viemtnas. If you have not had a pap done is a while they may want to do a pap test as well. Then you will make your appt for 20 weeks and hopefully a scan. Congrats good luck.|`|6bIdcRVkaa	It's possible to find out at this stage, it's just not as accurate. You'll most likely do blood work, urine tests, have a pap/pelvic done, doctor will check the heartbeat, etc.|`|QSodlfMraa	i found out at 17 weeks, but first visit they going to ask you about your family history and my a pop test so you can see the baby and the heart beat.|`|hoX7hoINaa	They'll do testing, blood draws, talk to you about how the next 5+ months will go for appointments, and typical ultrasounds are at 20 weeks to be sure of the sex.
2Pp2cDbJaa	if she doesn't want the child then she can sign away her parental rights and give the child to the father, simple as that, and if the father doesn't want to raise the child alone she can go to court and get his parental rights terminated so she can give the child up for adoption without the fathers consent|`|7JEojMgQaa	Because as a society we have decided that men who do not take responsibility for their children are DEAD BEAT DAD'S. You can't have it both ways, either the men are responsible or their not. since they ARE being help responsible, they have rights. They have the right to parent that child themselves. If a woman truly does not want to parent the child she should have no problem allowing the father that right.<br>  <br>  ETA: sorry I forgot to address the pro choice issue. It is a right granted to women over the state of their own body. If a man had the ability to conceive and carry a child I don't think there would be much of an arguement over how many children a person should be forced to have.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	When a fetus is in her body, she has full choice over what happens to her body.  When the fetus turns into a baby, once out of the woman's body, it is deemed a child, and men have a right to choose to raise their children.  <br>  <br>  Pro-choice is about a women's choice what to do with her body.  That is all it is.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Once she has brought a child into the world it gets more complicated than killing a bunch of cells. I'm sure if the father doesn't want the adoption he didn't want her to have an abortion. The women now brought something that is both part of her and the HUSBAND into the world. And he has every right to keep what is his.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Once a child is born it has rights.  The mother's rights do not outweigh the rights of the child.  Each child has TWO parents.  Both the mother and the father have parental rights.  The mother cannot decide independently that the child does not have the right to the care of its father.  She cannot tell the father that he is not allowed to parent the child.  Adoption is NOT a woman's right.  In fact, adoption is not a right at all.  It is legalized child abandonment.  A woman does not possess the right to force a father to abandon his child.  Even if both parents decide to relinquish their parental rights, the permission and oversight of the state is still required.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Well, technically they're both her right to chose.<br>  But the term "woman's right to chose" is representing the right women have to chose whether to abort a fetus or not. <br>  <br>  People don't get as touchy feely about adoption - how could they? But some people really don't like the idea of abortion, and some fully stick to "a woman's right to chose".|`|aMlWMkO5aa	Some people think adoption is unnatural or abnormal. Like how can you carry a baby for 9 months then give it away to a stranger? Personally I believe in the woman's right to choose whether it be abortion or adoption.|`|LvThe1Hcaa	Good question.  I guess what it is is that abortion deals with a woman's body.  But adoption deals with the child (of the father and mother).  I personally would go with the second rather that the first,but whatever.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	Because the baby is in HER body when she is pregnant, The Baby is a physical child when it is born.|`|BPuyPpNkaa	She has the right to choose abortion as long as the pregnancy hasn't gone past a certain stage in-utero.  In that case, she has the right to put the child up for adoption if the father doesn't want to take over the responsibilities if raising the child.
LWXRVO5Haa	If she burps less with the playtex give her that. You must still burp her often tho.<br>  <br>  Woah! Excuse me for misreading the question.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	probably means she is getting more air bc she is drinking faster with the avent..|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i dont know i use both the bottles i dont think it matters playtex is easier sometimes and avent is easier sometimes|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I have always found the Playtex drop-ins to be the best.  All babies are different, but your daughter also appears to do better with them.  As she gets older, and burps better on her own, you can try the Avent again.  That is, if cost plays a factor.  And BTW, Target brand drop-ins are just as good as the name brand, but the Parent's Choice ones stink.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Go with the playtex, the fact that she burps less means that she is getting less air.<br>  <br>  Fajina - that wasn't the question.

FkGh0LuWaa	Here is a list of some things I have in my kids learning area.  They are 4-2:<br>  Calender-The say the day of the week,month, day,  and year every day then put a sticker on the correct date.<br>  A paper plate clock-I took a small paper plate and wrote the numbers on it.  Then I cut two hands from paper and took a paper fastener and pocked it through the plate so the hands would move.  My boys like to practice their counting with this as well.<br>  Number Snake-I cut a bunch of different oval shapes from construction paper then glued them together in the shape of a snake and then wrote a number on each oval.<br>  Color Caterpillar- I cut a bunch of different circles from white construction paper then had my kids help me color the circles different colors.  Then we put them together in the shape of a Caterpillar.  <br>  Shape train-I cut different shapes from paper then put them together in the shape of a train and then hung it on the wall.  I let my kids help color the train.  <br>  Texture blanket-I took a old sheet and glued on different textures like fake fur, sand paper, feathers, foil, dried leaves, etc.  My kids helped me collect the items.<br>  We also have blocks, magnify glass, homemade musical instruments, and a bunch of different craft supplies.|`|3inMiq8Jaa	Sounds like your doing really good to me! Just teach him colors, numbers and ABC's. You can buy books for any age level at Wal-Mart, or a teacher store that have activities in them to help him learn. I would check out a teacher store, they have lots of things to get. You can cut out big letters and numbers or by foam ones to put on the floor and help him learn them and put them in order. Also let him learn the computer. Teach him the mouse first and how to point and click things. My daughter has learned that since she was 3 and can turn on/off the Computer, bring up a internet browser, click into favs and click on her game links. She has computer class in school already! www.starfall.com is a really good learning web site that are fun games, they use it at the schools. Also there are music CD's for ABC's and numbers and stuff. Let him watch pre-school shows and play the games on thier web sites. Good job for being a part of your child'ss education! I give you 5 stars!

qXq0nmBzaa	...no, unfortunately I do NOT love them.<br>  <br>  If I had a gun to my head and was forced to pick, I'd choose<br>  John Pierce and Lena Elyse but I wouldn't be happy with the choices...|`|1OpcR7bZaa	Don't like any of them they sound awful.

Gorgeous.<br>  Landon Pierce is too.<br>  <br>  Reese Alexa is pretty too. =]|`|syrh8J6Vaa	John Grayson is the only one I like for boys.

Great names :) they're all very lovely.<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Chase Austin is my favourite because I think it flows the best and it sounds like a name that would belong to a nice, friendly guy.<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  Lena Elyse has more class and, again, it flows well. It's also very elegant and I think it's great to incorporate your older sister's name into her name.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and have a great life with your child! :)|`|lr9E8IC5aa	Honestly, I'm not too fond of Grayson, a friend of mine just named his son Grayson and my first thought was it sounds like a girl name.

It's very unique and cute! For a girl, I'd go with Lena Elyse.|`|wWXon8Zsaa	Sorry, but the only name that I even think is just OK, is Chase Austin.|`|p5QtjGZdaa	Pretentious.|`|MFAMzb6waa	i like chase austin and lena elyse, why not include your mothers name? just a thought|`|FtKiHTFNaa	I like Pierce Grayson!|`|QHf2Ov6yaa	don't really like grayson personally, but the rest are good|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	What a bunch of negative comments!  I'm shocked!  I agree with you.  They are familiar enough the child won't have people saying "huh?, how do you spell that???" his or her whole life, and my favorite thing is that they are elegant names which will do well in business.  I can totally see Grayson wearing a gray suit and using Gray as his basic theme in his logos and decorating his office.  :)<br>  <br>  Since John is grandpa's name I think I'd name your son Johnathan Grayson and call him by his middle name.  It rolls off the tongue easier, it's more flattering to your dad, yet your son is not called "little John", and most importantly if your son doesn't like the name Grayson when he's older he can fall back on John.  It gives him more options.  I love that name so much I hope you have a boy!<br>  <br>  Reese Witherspoon and Lena Horne are the names that will come to peoples minds with both the girl names.  That's cool, they are both decent women.  I think I like Reese Alexis best.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to look at what the initials spell!!!!!!
xVEqBjDVaa	Hey! Give her a chance before you judge! Do you know who she is, if not then just wait until you get to know her. Maybe you should talk to your dad about this, i know that you don't feel secure right now since your parents are obviously divorced, but you have to at least give the girl a chance. She may be stupid and rude to you and you will hate her,or she may be nice and everything will be cool, or maybe you can just say ok, and move on...i think that the less you try to spend with her...the more she will try to get you to know her, which can cause problems. Just be nice and see how things go.|`|JRV8gHbkaa	I have a 12 year old daughter and she has met my girlfriend. At first she didn't like it either but she got used to the fact that I like her very much. Now, my daughter does more with my girlfriend than she does with her own mother. Her mother doesn't come around very often. My daughter lives with me. My daughter gave her a chance and they are very good friends now. My girlfriend also has 2 daughters and gives my daughter the same attention she does her own daughters. I think its great. Don't let your "step-dad" situation ruin a possible good friendship just because you think she might turn out like that. give it a chance to work out.|`|1tlgYKROaa	tell him honestly and privately how you feel but be willing to be friendly to his girlfriend when you are with her.  She is probably scared to death of your dislike so it will probably be awkward but it's something that has to be worked through if your dad is to be able to move on in his life as he deserves.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	It's okay to not like the idea of your dad having a girlfriend, but you want to try to be happy for him. You can't expect anyone to be alone for the rest of their lives, you know? So give this woman a chance, get to know her and decide if you think she's a good person.<br>  <br>  She's probably incredibly nervous to meet you too, be easy on her. Talk to her, be friendly, be open. Ask her a lot of questions about her life, about her family, about her job, etc. Find out everything you can about her before you decide if you aren't going to like her or not. Remember, you're interviewing her to be your potential stepmom too, so it's okay to ask questions. Just don't ask any rude ones lol, such as avoid asking her about her past relationships. Good luck!|`|fHjSonssaa	I had to meet my future stepmom when I was 12.  I was REALLY nervous.  The first time he was going to introduce us, we stopped by her house after church.  I was SO happy that she wasn't there.<br>  <br>  I'm am now 28 years old. They have been married since I was 13 years old.  <br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you (being that I don't know you, her or your dad) is to take it 1 day at a time.  <br>  Respect the fact that your father has a girlfriend- it's his right (hey- your mom's already married).  Try to be happy for him- I know it's hard.<br>  <br>  And don't beat her up- not before you know her.  It's unfortunate that your stepdad has to be one of those "charmers" to win you over- or at least your mom- and then turn into a jerk.  Those people are no fun.<br>  You don't have to tell your dad your dad you don't like what he's doing.  Chances are, he already knows you're uncomfortable with it.  What kids aren't- at least at first?<br>  <br>  One day at a time.<br>  <br>  I have a stepdad who I like, but he sucks at communication, so he blows up when he gets annoyed at something, versus just talking about it- (me, my son and my son's dad currently live with them until we move into a new place).  And yes, we have a blow-up here and there- but it's not the end of the world and we make up and get along after.<br>  <br>  Wait until you meet her- be open minded about.  Not only will you respecting her and your dad, but it will make the experience a lot more pleasant for you as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have patience!!
RdprMxoUaa	No I'm still not ready to do this yet either. My son is almost 11 months old and I still can only just bear him being in his own room by himself at night let alone off with someone else without me. I have only ever left him with my mother when she has come to my house and I need to go shopping. Actually I remember now that I did leave him with a friend at her house once but I had no other option and it was only for an hour. I think I'm the clingy one not him!<br>  Once he is weaned I may decide to let him stay at his grandparents place. Maybe.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I've left my daughter with my mother for not even 2 hours. I can't do it yet, I miss her too much, plus I worry whenever she's not with me. I'm sure I'll get over this paranoia sooner or later, though.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	yeah my sister in law has one daughter already and is pregnant again, she has my baby a few hours a week so she can get used to having a small baby again :) plus i get some well needed rest aswell! x|`|UriE3wN6aa	yeah i did it, you need your alone time too!! if they are willing then def. take them up on the offer!!|`|R0EsQapRaa	Absolutely.  My daughter has been spending the night at both my parents house and my in-laws house since she was a few months old.  I think it is important for both the parents to get a break and for the grandparents to bond with their grandchild.  My 8 month old gets so excited when she sees her grandparents and has a great time with them.  I am hoping this will also help with the "seperation anxiety" phase that most babies go through.  So far there are no problems.  We might by-pass that all together.  Not to mention the grandparents LOVE spending private time with the baby.  Of course if you have non-trustworthy people who want to watch her, then I would be hesitant.<br>  <br>  I personally think it is important for the child to bond with and feel the love from their grandparents.  It doesn't make you any less of a parent to let the grandparents spend time with their grandchild.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	My sister is always bugging me to let her spend the night at her house but I always tell her how horrible my daughter is at night. I tell her she wakes up a lot to nurse and my sister will tell me she'll wake up and feed her. I just run out of excuses so I blamed it on my husband. LOL someone has to be the bad guy. i know how you feel. My baby is 11 months old and I still have yet to leave her overnight with anyone. I know I will just miss her too much.|`|YLXpwqceaa	My daughter is 8 months old.  The ONLY person I trust is my mom and dad.<br>  <br>  My SIL watched her once (that was the last time), she messed up her formula feedings(put too much powder  with way too little water) and my daughter had kidney problems for a week.<br>  <br>  My MIL hold her and she screams - my daughter hates her, so I do not let her watch her either.<br>  <br>  If I need time, it's my mom, and that's it.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	My parents kept my son for a couple of hours when he was 3 weeks old, and I cried almost the whole time! I didn't leave him again until he was almost 6 months old. When my daughter was born, I had my mom come watch the kids so I could run some errands when she was 2 weeks old, and I didn't want to come back to the house! it was so peaceful and quiet! (plus my daughter never stopped crying for 4 months...)|`|uLdeIhHqaa	The only person I let my Daughter stay with is my Mom. I have worrysome issues and Im very paranoid to let anyone watch my Daughter. My Mom keeps her every Friday for about 3 hours while my husband and I go eat and run errands. <br>  <br>  None of my Husbands side has ever watched her. Just my Mom.|`|4yUUUkAsaa	My daughter is 8 1/2 months and my mom has kept her on several occasions anywhere from 2 days up to a week.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Hell no!  I wouldn't feel comfortable with my daughter out of my sight.  We haven't been apart since the day she was born.|`|rFtKFp03aa	I have 9 month old triplets... I haven't let anyone take them... but I have let people come here and watch them while I am napping or if I run to the grocery store... <br>  <br>  People usually offer to bring themselves out to my house, taking 3 babies somewhere is harder... <br>  <br>  My mom has a nursery for them at her house, I have taken them there, but have stayed with them.. or just ran an errand real fast.. <br>  <br>  Other than that not really... not sure if it would be different if I just had one?
uhj76Fkpaa	Hi there!<br>  Since you are the one that babysits the 3 yr old you should put some rules to her behavior.Stick to what you say,just say firmly "No!" when she wants something she can't have or punish her by taking some of her toys when she won't obeys you.<br>  You should talk to your aunt and explain to her that you're facing those problems with her child.Mention that you don't have any problem babysitting her but you can't let her do what she wants every time she wants it.<br>  When she's having those temper tantrums let her finish.Don't try to calm her down,don't let yourself to be manipulated by her.She'll scream and eventually realize that this is not helping her and stop.If she gets what she wants with screaming she'll use it always....she's 3yrs old...she know what she's doing.<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped.Take care|`|9dfd9b4f3ace5c51404b8b22188daaa1aa	kill him|`|I7ktUFQfaa	Well for starters you need to realise she is THREE, and probably doesn't realise the things she is doing are bad or dangerous, that's where you come in, you need to teach her that some things are dangerous. If she grabs something that is dangerous, take it away from her and say something like "No! you don't play with these, these will give you boo-boo's" or something like that. If you don't tell her certain things are dangerous or not to be played with, how is she to know? She is only a baby still, and at this age is very curious.<br>  <br>  You should talk to her mom ( your aunt I assume ) about her punishment and what would be appropriate for her. Most moms would probably tell a babysitter to do time-outs.|`|AA11315360	You should put her in a time out. Make her sit on a step in the house or on a mat and tell her she is in time out. Explain to her what she did that was bad and that she has to sit there until you say she can get up because she was bad. If she moves from the spot go place her back there until she stays.<br>  <br>  I suggest you watch the tvs shows like Nanny 911 or Supernanny. Many helpful hints on there.|`|AA10188961	I have a 3 year old, and it's almost impossible to get anything done unless she's taking a nap.  So, first of all, if you are babysitting you need to pay attention to the child and play with her, that way she will stay upstairs.  If you have work to do and can't watch her properly, you probably need to tell the mother that.|`|KtlHpp3saa	the corner take away her toys tell her she cantt watch her favorite show she will understand|`|I2iXz32paa	Usually a firm "No" works out okay, sometimes a time out will work. My friend's daughter tends to break down crying if she's told she's been bad and she usually will stop.<br>  <br>  Try a time out, and if she gets up start the time over again and tell her that it will start over every time she gets up.|`|pPKhVRXJaa	it sounds like he needs his bottom popped.|`|A5sCcYdEaa	she needs a timeout
p2J1KcNRaa	Well I had a positive test after two negatives and then the next day had a negative and I am not sure what to think about that. I am going to call the dr. tomorrow.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Your negative could have been wrong.|`|ZTb7O6VJaa	I have heard of women thinking they are pregnant because of a positive pregnancy test and then they blood test comes back negative, which meant that they had a false positive on their pregnancy test, as for a false negative, I have never heard of that. Wait for your HCG levels to come back as they are the only thing that will 100% tell you whether you are pregnant or not. HTH...
4BBjhHAnaa	Accidentally, huh?<br>  <br>  Well, sugar.  Snookums just wasn't as happy here as she could be, so mommy took her to a farm with a bunch of other cats where she can run around and chase mice all day!!!  I'm sorry baby, but she really is happier, now.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	How about mommy just accidentally placed Kitty in the microwave and she fried it, but it was only after Kitty silly him, got under the big wheels of mommy's van..<br>  <br>  Accidentally eh??<br>  Your 4 yr olds cat??|`|tnJhCU7Aaa	just sit her down and say that her cat went for a walk for a bit and when/if she asks you again tell her her cat is at a sleep over visiting an old friend of the cats.|`|75TRCPx0aa	go with the first answer that is good and then she won't cry or nuthing and sorry for the lost of your cat|`|2n0vR0OMaa	Accidentally ran over maybe, but sticking in the microwave sounds a bit Hannibal the cannibal. Honesty (not the microwave part, nor the I ran it over part) is the best policy. Death is part of life... cat has been run over, a funeral service to remember poor mog. Your girl needs to know that her cat won't be back, and that it's ok to be sad.|`|ju4we8j0aa	oh- wow. <br>  <br>  Tell her that because she really loved her cat so much, the cat was chosen out of millon cats all over the world to go to a special, happy place and before the cat left it told you to tell her that she shouldnt worry or miss the cat.|`|0d7wdeNWaa	Sorry, you stuck your cat in the microwave?<br>  <br>  Thats inhumane, why did you do that?|`|kD7xr1kcaa	You could tell her that her cat has left to start his own family with.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	then animal rights services is on their way... braise yourself :o)|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Show her the cat, she will get the picture.
aGXankr2aa	If she names you as the father, you are legally responsible for that child unless you can prove you're not the father.<br>  <br>  Maybe next time you won't be an idiot and have unprotected sex.|`|AA12103453	Can SHE drag you there? No, BUT the Court can. They have this amazing power called a Subpoena. If you decide NOT to go still then they have this other cool power called the Bench Warrant, which is a warrant for your ARREST where the police(usually Sheriff/Constable who act as the arm of the Court over regular cops) will come and put you in cuffs and take you to the station. You would get an arrest record and you would eventually end up in the Court anyway. Better to go to the Court if she tells you to.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Did you ever hear of DNA Testing? <br>  Let's all hope the child is not yours. Get yourself a vasectomy and save the world.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	If she wants to push the issue, she certainly can drag you to court.  She can also get child support and pretty much anything she wants.  If she can prove the baby is yours, she can make you pay for all of the medical bills associated with the pregnancy, her transportation and anything else associated with the baby.  You might want to find out if it's really your baby.|`|AA11784984	She will file for a paternity test you will have to take it. If you are the father she most likely will file for child support and if you don't pay you will have to go to court or have a warrant for your arrest. So no she can't drag you but unless you want to get arrested you should go.|`|hoX7hoINaa	If you are the father, she can get child support from you. If you don't think its yours, have the baby and you tested after he/she is born to find out. If its not yours, then no she can't hold anything over you.|`|AA11315360	Yes she can drag you into court for a paternity test and to make you pay child support. You are required BY LAW to pay child support if the child is yours. Get a DNA paternity test before you sign the birth certificate (if you put your name on the birth certificate then it doesnt matter if the baby is yours or not, you are officially the father so wait until paternity test is done).<br>  Try to encourage her to give the baby up for adoption.|`|98WKYtfwaa	She can't drag you, but the law can. <br>  <br>  How do you know you're not the father? You had sex, so it's a possibilty. A judge will order a paternity DNA test on you, if it's positive that you're the father then you'll get made to pay child support, if you disagree and don't want to pay then you go to jail, you need to pay child support regardless if you want to see the child or not.|`|wR6qp414aa	Let's see, you had sex.  Now it is time to face the consequences of your actions.  Sex isn't a pass time.  It is something that you do because you love each other AND to reproduce.  I don't know what's with people today.<br>  <br>  But if she is your girlfriend WHY would you leave her hanging.  That isn't very nice and certainly not very responsible.<br>  <br>  She can take you for child support and force you to get a paternity test.  <br>  <br>  But think about this.  If this child is yours, do you want that child knowing that you didn't want it?  How would you feel if your father did that to you?|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	No but a judge can physically drag you.  It takes ONE time to conceive a baby.  If you think you MAY not be the father, they will demand a paternity test.<br>  If you don't want this to happen again, maybe you should be in a loving and stable relationship before having sex with just anyone.<br>  With all the diseases in the world, maybe you should be more careful.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	She can take you to court, probably after the baby is born, and get a peternity test. If you are sure you aren't the father, then that shouldn't be a problem.<br>  If it turns out you are the father, there will be custody hearings, and you will have to pay child support.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	if she files a court order to the judge you'll be forced to take a paternity test for proof otherwise if you dont obey with the law you'll have a warrant issued for your arrest|`|G766dQjtaa	If she's taking you to court for a paternity test you need to go. If the child id not yours there is nothing you need to worry about. Just go and get it over with.|`|VESdMODnaa	she can get a court ordered paternity test and find out if you are or not. If you don't go you will get arrested.|`|AA11121510	She won't, but she'll have her lawyers drag your butt to court.  You'll be forced to give a DNA sample and if the kid is yours, you'll pay, pay, pay.<br>  <br>  Next time try a condom dude.  A kids costs over $250,000 to raise to age 18.  A condom costs $2.50.<br>  <br>  Better yet, keep your johnson in your pants and think with your brain next time.|`|p2J1KcNRaa	it depends on the state you live in, but some states do a dna test that you would have to pay for to prove paternity.

Anytime you have sexual intercourse condom, or no condom, you could be pregnant. You should wait about 3 weeks and then take a test. If you take it sooner you might get a false negative.|`|6pLLPdPwaa	It's best to wait until at least a day or two before your period is due. But some women don't show up that early.

wR6qp414aa	Take a test to find out.<br>  <br>  Be aware that birth control pills mess with the normal workings of our bodies.  It confuses the system and when going off birth control your body does not know what to do.  This is why there are so many women that have problems conceiving after being on the pill for a while.<br>  <br>  Our bodies are not meant to have extra hormones in them.  We are set up to work a certain way.<br>  <br>  It might be a while before your body stabilizes.  <br>  <br>  The hormones will act with the pituitary gland which runs a lot of systems, including weight gain/loss.
oiJITSNZaa	some tests show up to 5 days before your period...but it depends how much of the hormone your body produces and again that varies from person to person...if you don't notice anything then don't put up your hopes too high.|`|txSiQc7Waa	Your best bet is to wait until you've missed your period. That way you don't get a false positive by testing to soon. It doesn't matter what the hpt box says, if the baby implanted late... it's not going to detect it even if the box says "5 days sooner". So you're in a waiting game now... Good luck and baby dust to you!|`|ir0qEV3waa	it is not advisable to take a test until missed period on the other hand don't keep waiting and waiting im there at the minute and its awfully painful. can u answer my question? for the first time u take a test u can wait another three days and take another good luck xx|`|DxdAyTp5aa	wait until the 6th day before ur period thats the closest you can do it and it might come up neg but take another when you've missed your period good luck|`|1f07fa72ab1e649113e84041b632823daa	Wait at least until your first missed period, then get a good preggo test!

Very sporty and cute.<br>  Chase Reese - Sounds a little off with the "s" sound at the end of both names.  How about Chase Landon, Gabriel Reese, or Mason Reese?<br>  Xavier Spencer - Don't care for names beginning with "X".  How about Logan Spencer?<br>  <br>  Girls<br>  Alexis Reed - Don't care for Reed.  How about Alexis Michelle or Alexis Aubrielle?<br>  Reed Noelle - Don't care for Reed.  How about Kailey Noelle or Aubrey Noelle?<br>  Serenity Blue(Serena) - Like Serenity/Serena, but not Blue.  Sounds too gloomy and sad.  How about Serenity Grace or Serenity Brianne?<br>  Taylor Isabella - Don't really care for Taylor.  How about Isabella Kate?<br>  Rainn Ailani - Too out there for me.  I would just get rid of this name entirely.<br>  Eleni Lailani - Too out there for me, also.  I would just get rid of this name entirely.<br>  Skylar Blake - Too boy-ish.  It's cute for a boy though!<br>  Spencer Snow - Spencer is a boy's name, and Snow is too "nature-y".
afAbSq5gaa	you cannot possibly pregnant if u didnt have sex with  him so dont even worry about it, besides the even if u did  ur chances of being pregnant are low as u are on birthcontrol|`|plI0WOrUaa	You are fine, don't worry.  but if you are worried about pregnancy, use other protection with the pill.  It does happen where people get pregnant on the pill, so you can use a condom or spermicides or something just to increase your protection.|`|i6gZ5GQgaa	If he got excited at all he could have accidentally squirted some onto your vagina.  In that case you are probably pregnant.|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	Nothing at all to be worrying about,it will delay your period so try not to stress. best of luck xx|`|tQPvv0Glaa	As long as you take the pill as prescribed, at the same time every day, you have nothing to worry about.  You're being silly, don't stress =)
kIad9ffRaa	I was 15 when I got my last one. But, your butt is theirs till you turn 18. And you probably deserved it.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	when you behave you're too old to get spankings
b457ca42a84d649f207ac8de710d5a89aa	Its not that bad. It will look better once you style it yourself. Maybe put some clips or cute barrettes in it. It will grow out. Don;t sweat it too  much!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I would re get it cut.  Make it more feminine, an angled bob with wedge in the back like posh spice used to have it but not uneven, both sides the same, or like Katie Holmes.|`|uuceuyRyaa	umm.....right.<br>  <br>  <br>  you can go bald!!|`|68c6B8dRaa	She did a lousy job on the ends but it's a cute cut. If you have money to burn, find a _good_ salon, and ask them to "fix" it. You'd lose very little length and get a lot more body, and it would hang much more nicely.<br>  <br>  But it does NOT look "terrible" right now. Relax.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I actually think it looks cute. But, this is where girlie hair clips, bright headbands and bobby pins come in. It will grow back faster than you think, and I do think it looks cute. I've seen way, way worse.|`|BRT2teSqaa	I dont know why this is in parenting but hair GROWS.  A couple months and itll grow back to normal|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	cry|`|pqlhPnexaa	It's not bad at all. In a month or so, it'll be on its way back to a more regular length.<br>  <br>  What you should do for now: go to the drugstore, and buy a few different kinds of hair gel (one of my friends with short hair likes the stuff by Garnier Fructis). That way, you can make it looks a little more styled and "messy", rather than looking all limp and whatever.<br>  <br>  Buy some cute headbands- Forever 21 has them for very cheap, so go all out. You can get very plain ones or more fancy ones, depending on your style.<br>  <br>  If you have extra time to style your hair, curl it- when hair is curly, it's nearly impossible to see how it's cut. Another alternative if you want people to be distracted from the cut is to run some semipermanent highlights through it.<br>  <br>  <3 I hope that helped!|`|ysUg2Rgraa	Personally, Sweetie, it looks fine. You can just comb it back, & top it off with a colorful headband.|`|KWWU4ajzaa	are u a boy?

WzKrZoHQaa	Realise you are worried but you just asked trhis same question 5 times now.  If she in Uk she can get test without parents knowledge.  Try this website and call them tomorrow - they are specifically for ppl aged 13-19 yrs for all sort of reasons not just pregnancy and they will be able to give you BOTH helpful good honest advice and support.  That is why sex is for adults.  Make sure you have better contraception for next time.|`|saJ5Zv4Iaa	Sounds like she could be. <br>  Now its time to grow up cuz you have 9 months to get your act together!|`|vygYFdsSaa	I really don't understand why people come on here and ask this. Nobody can predict if your girl's gonna be pregnant or not, why doesn't she just take a pregnancy test?? If you're worried about it isn't it easier to just figure it out with a 3 minute test rather than ask a bunch of people on the internet to somehow figure it out?|`|ltHKURBhaa	It sounds like she is pregnant you need to buy some hpt and get her to take them if not take her to the doctor<br>  <br>  good luck|`|RP80pVdBaa	Go and get tested<br>  Good luck|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	I'd be worried to son.Time to get a job marry her and do what's right.|`|YWAoSctPaa	Yes, she very well could be.

Your just paranoid. Calm down. Don't get worried unless you miss your period.|`|OBPL49vWaa	you cant tell in just 2 days, and your test wont read possitive until you miss your first period so you have a while to wait. you should talk to your boyfriend he should know if he pulled out or not.  there is no need to tell your mom until you miss your period you just get her all worried and she will probably start yelling at you.|`|iO4YHFavaa	Do a pregnancy test. <br>  That simple.|`|K4k80oDGaa	Tell your mom. I was15 when I got pregnant and I kept it from my mom for 5 months. To this day I wish I would have told he. She will be mad at you but it will bring you closer. If you keep it from her then she will not trust you. Dont be scared, if you are pregnant, you are not the first and you will not be the last. Get a test, if its negative dont tell. If its positive and you decide you wanna keep it, tell your mom right away. But to answer your question, just b/c you are eating alot and gaining weight doent mean your pregnant. Is your stomach round and hard in the middle?

reO9Dgmsaa	I liked the BG 3.0s at FIRST, then was disappointed at how quickly the velcro wore out.  :(  I am only buying snap diapers from now on!!  BG JUST came out with organic snap one size AIOs, which I am thrilled about and will be purchasing, since I do think overall BG is good quality.  <br>  I also like my Swaddlebees Econappi and organic one size velour fitted, and my Mommy's Touch one size snap AIO.  I also am a big fan of Baby Beehinds; I have a wool cover and a one size snap bamboo fitted from them, and plan on buying more, along with the hemp one size snap fitteds.  :)<br>  <br>  I like one size diapers because they are very convenient and save money overall.  I like snaps because they last longer.  I like organics if at all possible, for my baby's health and the good of the planet.  I like pockets, prefolds, fitteds and AIOs, all in different ways.  For instance, I love the ease of pockets and AIOs; they are like a disposable you wash!   Prefolds are tough, cheap, and absorbent, but they are HUGE!  LOL!  So I usually only use them at night.  Fitteds are nice at home since you can leave the cover off and let baby have more air on his bum.  <br>  <br>  I LOVE CLOTH!!  ;)|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I use prefolds and prorap covers with my 2 year old daughter. I have been very happy with them. I have had some wicking issues, but I put the covers in the dryer on hot, and it seemed to take care of the problem. They are a bit bulky though. I have a hard time getting her jeans over her butt! we usually use disposables when we go out. I would like to try some slimmer pocket diapers, but they are a little too expensive right now.<br>  I love the prefolds, and if you don't like prorap, there are tons of other covers to try!|`|FX6fDA7jaa	I love wonder wrap and bumgenuis 3 because both of them is one size , it fit newborn to 30lbs , i use both of them with prefold , it worked very well for my baby ( he is now 2 months and 3 weeks ) , i changed it every two hours. I bought wonder wrap second quality but it worked very well . I hope it help you|`|AA11903503	As far as price goes my favorite are the bumGenius 3.0 one-size. I rarely have problems with them and because they are pocket diapers they dry quickly and at night I can stuff them more.<br>  I think Thirsies makes a great cover and AIO (AIO take way too long to dry though).<br>  I have a few other brands, but again if your looking to move away from prefolds and such I'd start with the BG|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I have been happy with bum genius 3.0 diapers. They are one size and soft. Thirsties covers with a prefold work well too if you are willing to use prefolds. Thirsties covers are much softer than bummis, I hated my bummis as well. I like bamboo prefolds best, try pandatushies.com, they hold a lot and stretch to allow movement.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	got them from sears.  they have snaps and adjust to go from newborn to bigger.  they also have a packet to add a folded diaper in middle for thickness.

ENANtueuaa	You can give her whole milk a few times a day, but she should still be on formula until she is at least a year. So, don't take the formula away comletely yet, she still needs it for brain development!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes my mom started me at 9mons because i had so many teeth nd the doc said the bottle would rot my teeth so try it if u feel ready|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Not until she is 12 months and then she should be on whole milk.  When she is 2 she can be on whatever milk the rest of the family is drinking.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	A lot of moms start the transition from formula to cow's milk at about 11 months.

61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Well i for one do not think she is too young.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	The normal recommendation is 6 months, because by then baby has started solids and can tolerate any water they might accidental (or on purpose with some kids) swallow. If younger babies swallow too much water it can cause a sever electrolyte imbalance which can cause a life long problem. That doesn't mean you can't have younger babies in the water, just don't "swim" them on their bellies until they can keep their heads up really well and don't put them under the water until they are older. When you do baby swimming lessons, a large portion of the classes focus on getting baby comfortable on their tummies in the water and learning how to do safe submersion's under the water, so there's no point in doing lessons until 6 months.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	just dont submerge her in water u dont want her to maybe get an ear infection but i think it would be good bonding|`|3SFxfoHEaa	well considering she spent nine months in water, it's a good idea to get her used to being in a pool with you. some pools offer mother and baby hours, all babies of all ages will be there. i believe that it will be a benefit to both of you where you can both bond and meet new people. make sure her vaccines are current and don't go submerging her in the water, but a safety device designed for babies or being held in your arms will help your baby in terms of confidence and of course her milestones.|`|2pxiK9waaa	You can do mommy and me swim classes from birth, basically. There are also infant swim classes in major metropolitan areas. Why not call a few places and ask or ask them if they know of anywhere that will do them. Don't rely on "someone" telling you something. Call the source and find out!|`|lzivF4Idaa	wow. <br>  <br>  1- you can hold her carefully in the water and let her feet and bottom half of her body splash in it <br>  2- she's not going to start doing the fricken breast stroke just yet....might wanna give it another week or two.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Swimming lessons--- 3 months old? Okay those two ideas don't belong in the same sentence. A baby that young doesnt even know how to splash yet.|`|AscBWmTmaa	3 Months is a good time to start having a baby feel good about being in the water.  While a baby that age cant actually swim, there are good lessons about "how not to drown" that babies under the age of one CAN learn.  Babies can be taught that if they fall into the water, it is really easy to float if they turn on their backs and just lay still. Then, paddling with the feet can be added, to get to an edge of a pool.  They also learn that they can lay still and YELL FOR help/ cry if they can.  So the two benenfits to starting this young can be 1) Good attitude/ water confidence for the future and 2) safety/ life-saving skills.|`|DQ8WR6CXaa	Oh no!!!<br>  I am in the process of receiving a child development minor & this is a very popular subject. People are not very aware that studies have shown that exercise like this is actually not beneficial, but DETRIMENTAL. Fitness level at their age is not one to improve cardiovascular health, strength and flexibility. The limited development of their bodies cannot sustain certain exercises & positions. <br>  ''Swimming classes for infants are popular and may seem like a safe and sensible option for parents concerned about water safety.<br>  <br>  However, in a special report by the AAP, Prof Small and his colleagues recommend that parents don't enrol children under the age of four for swimming and aquatic lessons.<br>  <br>  Prof Small says: 'Generally, children aren't ready, developmentally, for swimming lessons until after their fourth birthday, and toddlers are limited by their physical capacity in the water."<br>  <br>  I know your intentions are good, but wait a few more years.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I would definitely take your baby swimming.<br>  <br>  When you say "lessons" people assume you're going to let go of the baby and teach strokes...ridiculous!<br>  <br>  All our children swim. Living near the beach we feel it is important. And confidence in the water is an amazing gift to give to a child.<br>  <br>  The person who said they just learnt it was bad....the article you posted a link to, was talking about swimming for "fitness" and encouraging children to go the gym and aerobics. That's not the same as going to the swimming pool and splashing around. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your swimming :)|`|UxG6CkU2aa	3 months is really too young for lessons. Although if you were to get into water with baby it would be a good bonding experience for you and baby, and relaxing for you both, if baby is not scared. I put my kids in lessons at 3 years old, that seemed to be a good age for them.|`|1JGj56TFaa	Take her to the pool and let her become confident in the water.  If you leave it to long, she may not like it.  I  took both my son (age 5) and daughter (6 months) at 3 months old and they both love the water.|`|nYioXmnGaa	Um yeah she is a little to young to swim still maybe you could put her in a floaty ting that floats across the pool or something !!!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	She can't learn to swim yet, but she can learn to have fun in the water.|`|LEEWDb6Eaa	As an experienced baby and Toddler Swim Teacher I would say the earlier the better, as long as the umbilical severance is healed then your good to go although you should okay it with your doctor first.<br>  You may find this link on immunisation useful: <a href="http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Search?terms=baby+swimming" rel="nofollow">http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Search?te...</a><br>  <br>  The main considerations to take into account are: How warm is the pool?<br>  The pool should really be at least 30 degrees for a child above 12 pounds in weight. If your child is younger than 12 weeks or lighter than 12 pounds you shouldn't consider a pool temperature below 32 degrees.<br>  I would highly recommend a baby wetsuit for keeping baby warmer in the pool, try bubble and swirl - <a href="http://www.bubbleandswirl.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.bubbleandswirl.co.uk</a>  We recommend them to all of our customers. <br>  You should also consider a double nappy system, this system is fundamentally a huggies disposable swim nappy against the skin with a re-usable swim nappy cover on top, then you'd put the wetsuit (if needed) over the top. This protects the pool from unwanted nappy leakage. <br>  <br>  Finally your baby usually has a natural breath holding reflex and this is how they cope with submersions, by the time babies reach 6-9 months they begin to lose the reflex and breath holding then needs to become a conscious decision. Therefore you are best starting them swimming whilst they still have their natural breath holding reflex available. <br>  Hope this helps..|`|J5TbYvVZaa	I don't think it's too young. We started swimming lessons with my son right before he turned 4 months. It's not actually swimming...it's getting them used to being in the water and you're in the water with them. We did stick with it and today at 2.5 he's a fish! I was reassured by my decision to start him early when we were in lessons when he was 12 months and a lot of the other kids who were there, that had never been in any kind of lessons, were crying and afraid to get in. Good luck and have fun!|`|DvWGTzLUaa	You can take babies swimming from new born. Granted it may be quite some time before she can actually swim. But she will enjoy the water with you anyway. Some pools have special sessions for babies and parents where they play games and sing songs and stuff. You should look into it.|`|nuTvB84Gaa	I would wait to actually teach her till shes about 7-9 months.<br>  <br>  But you can still swim with her and let her play around.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)
IRZ4czGPaa	yes you can! when i delivered my baby they had both of us taking antibiotics for a bout 2 weeks... i would go up to the NICU in the hospital and breastfeed my baby i was a little concerned but the nurses said it wasnt a problem at all it was actually good for the  baby.
nKXTjqQWaa	Unless you are ready to be a parent then I would say yes, sex is bad for a 15 year old.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Not if you do it safely and take all necessary precautions.<br>  You also need to understand that accidents do happen.<br>  <br>  EDIT: aww a thumbs down? My little brother is 15 and had sex. It's a fact of life. He is safe about it and I am not an aunt. If they're going to have sex they at least need to be educated. I mean honestly!|`|6oTf5INjaa	I would say yes only because I got pregnant on birth control and now im married to the baby's dad. Pregnancy isnt meant for those who aren't married. If you keep your self pure, you can save yourself for the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. It is just my opinion.

gPg7qYGIaa	only midwifes / dr or health visitors should be taking blood or giving jags so your sister will not need needles|`|j65rSZ26aa	they give the baby a series of shots after they're first born. She will have an appt two wks after birth and they should give her an immunization schedule. Why on earth would your sis wan to give the baby shots herself?

3hBQz33Yaa	It's called a partial birth abortion. It's illegal but i actually did research on this at one point and there were hospitals that got busted for doing this. Parents would go full term or at least to 24 weeks if they found out the baby had birth defects like down syndrome, spina bifida, ect. or even if the parents had just changed their minds they would give the parents the choice of partial birth abortions. Then they would take the baby to the to the waste room lay them on a paper towel on the stainless steele counter and leave them there to pass. Its disgusting its MURDER and i as i was reading these stories it made me sick my stomach and brought tears to my eyes. How anybody could do something like that is beyond me! Its sick! Also there is another  sick way that i dont even want to describe but the baby is MURDERED when its only half way out of the mom by the doctor who is sick enough to be willing to do it.|`|VS8mactUaa	Murder<br>  <br>  There is no official procedure to "abort" a baby after birth, it is literally considered murder after the child is already born.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	it isnt legal...but i guess partial birth abortion.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	A partial birth abortion requires the woman to give birth to everything but the head, (The doctor pulls the legs out first) then the doctor pierces the skull and sucks out the contents and then the head is delivered.  By law a baby is not allowed to be killed after it is completely emerged from the womb, and if it is then it is legally considered murder.  It has to be done before the baby is completely born.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	There is no such procedure.  The law of the United States of America does not allow live full term babies to be killed.|`|AA11784984	I think its a partial birth abortion and they are illegal.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	That is disgusting and wrong!!!!|`|wR6qp414aa	Same as before birth...Murder.<br>  <br>  Technically it is partial birth abortion.  <br>  <br>  Our new president signed before he became president that this is ok to do.  There is a procedure where the baby is born and then left to die on it's on or placed in formalin until it stops breathing.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	its not legal in Scotland it the law over here once your baby had it 1st breath it would be murder to kill it over here you have to have abortion be for  its anywhere nere full tearm|`|AA12299132	Never heard of it - but it could be the answer to the worlds problems if it was made compulsory for the next 80 years!|`|AA11121510	Murder.<br>  <br>  The same as when the baby is aborted before birth.|`|j65rSZ26aa	that's absolutely ridiculous and I've never heard of that before.

Check out the link it will tell you more. Honestly I think it is really sad but I guess there are some medical reasons for it to be done but I think may be legal in some states if the mom wants an abortion after 20 weeks. I hope this helps you out|`|yLyMG8Emaa	Oh I know exactly what you are talking about!<br>  <br>  MURDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  And on top of that, that is absolutely disgusting! It is horrific! I don't even want to think about that!
a7pgX1W8aa	You have to give yourself a few months to adjust to the pill. If after about 4 months your periods are still very heavy maybe the pill your on is not working that well for you. If this is the case go to your doctor and tell him/her what is going on and they can prescribe one that will work better for you. Hope this helps.
plBQDf7Taa	kill him (the guy not the baby)...at least that's what my feminist english teacher would do. If that seems a bit inconvenient, you should seriously consider adoption...you can go to the adoption agency prior to having the baby, and they will look in their records for anyone looking for the type of baby that you may be able to provide(by "type" i mean physical characteristics). They will do background checks on you and the father, then consult the potential parents. You can set up a contract that requires your approval of the parents that will get your child. You can even negotiate meeting rights, so you can see him/her grow up and be a part of his/her life. even with all of this, the most natural and logical choice would be to just keep it and say fuc the man. Single parenting can be hard, but if you find a partner who appreciates the opportunity to raise a child (whether it is his or not), then things will work out. Good luck with all that. Even if the adoption or single parenting works out, you may still want to consider the first suggestion just for fun.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Make him pay child support|`|AA11121510	Single mom or adoption.<br>  <br>  Dump the deadbeat if he is not up to accepting his responsibilities.  If he won't now, he never will.
wR6qp414aa	Your baby is pretty well protected, but if you fall the wrong way it is likely to cause a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  This is assault and should be reported to the authorities.  If you are under 18, you need to call children's services.  If you are over 18, you need to call the police and press charges.<br>  <br>  If you are under 18, you can still call children's services even if this happened before.  It doesn't have to have happened just today.  You can let them know that you are pregnant and scared.|`|BjmJharpaa	i suggest you stay away from your moms boyfriend<br>  does your mom know he does that to you?<br>  also there is a chance something can happen to the baby if you get hit or pushed
AA11121510	Go to the drugstore and get a kit or better yet, go to a doctor.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	you are not pregnant.|`|3HSOymkPaa	its very doubtfull that you are pregnant the morning after pill may make u have an off period any way. but if you really want to make sure consult your doctor|`|dg6wd8ufaa	I doubt youre pregnant.

UlkQT8eeaa	This is definitely normal. During pregnancy you will experience more breakouts and acne then ever in your life and if your skin gets oily like mine during prenancy you might experience blackheads too. I haven't gotten blackheads but the doc says the oil can surely cause them. <br>  Even during puberty I didn't break out like I did during the earlier weeks of my pregnancy like weeks 4 to 25. Then I started breaking out on my shoulders. Lol and proactiv did not work. <br>  The breakouts do ease up as your pregnancy progresses though|`|tKXMQCN1aa	The hormones called androgens increase during pregnancy...therefore increasing acne breakouts...Everyone is different, so they may stay throughout your pregnancy. Be careful using certain acne medications, because they could harm your baby. Try taking oatmeal baths and cold showers and moisturizing before you contact your doctor..Good luck.|`|eqmkKYrBaa	i had the same issue with both of my children. in fact thats kind of how i knew i was pregnant now. don't worry it'll go away|`|K2dodrKLaa	Yes its all part of being pregnant!! lol it sucks eh... not much u can really do about it use face cleaners but it never worked for me when i was pregnant|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah it normal to break out, ask your dr what you can use.|`|AA10458750	Oh yes....you r going to look a mess acne wise your whole pregnancy. You may have better days, but it doesn't clear up.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	Ugh..I get it to. With my first and now my second.<br>  It is totally normal and unfortunitly most cleansers are unsafe to use while pregnant. My doctor just said soap and water.<br>  I had it through my whole first pregnancy. and we will see with my second. I am only 10 weeks!<br>  <br>  Oh and some pl might recomend proactiv. DO NOT USE THIS very very harmful to your baby!|`|C9QQPROkaa	Yes sad but true try this link hope it helps.|`|rctDnhO1aa	yes because your hormones are acting like when you went through puberty which is when most people get a lot of acne all you can really do is wash with a gentle soap or if you're desperate go see a dermatologist|`|AA11784984	Yes it's normal. Your hormones are going crazy!!
EEP5Z4muaa	I had my gallbladder removed in January '07 (pregnancy induced gallstones!)  and I felt healed "inside" within say a month.  They say no lifting etc for two weeks so as you don't rupture anything and obviously falling pregnant quite as soon as you have perhaps isn't ideal, I would like to think that it won't be too threatening to you or the baby, but I would check with your doctor, This type of surgery isn't as major any more due to these keyhole techniques, so healing and recovery time is so much faster than it was when you had to be "opened up". I checked after my surgery that should I want another baby that there would be no problems in the future and the surgeon assured me that that would be fine.  Even though babies grow very quickly from the onset of conception, the womb doesn't rise above your pelvis until after the 12th week I believe, then things start to "shift" upwards to make room for the growing baby and the womb.  The pains you are experiencing now, I am fairly certain will be the normal "growing" pains of your uterus growing for your baby, especially if this is your first, during my first pregnancy I really had excruciating pains during the first 12 weeks and even a bit after simply due to things growing, your stomach muscles as well as your uterus have never had to do this before and they take a bit of stretching! So right now don't worry, but just as soon as you would normally check in with your doctor for a pregnancy, make sure they are aware of your recent surgery and check with them that everything will be fine, I am sure it will be.  Good luck with your pregnancy and congratulations<br>  <br>  PS I am pregnant now - with no side effects after my gallbladder removal, I know this was 2 years ago, but if it helps you feel better... I am fine.|`|WeYEDlWRaa	I got pregnant just a couple months after I had my gallbladder removed as well.  It has presented no problems for me, in fact I am due in May.  Best of wishes to you.  If you are really worried, go see an OB as soon as possible.
FkGh0LuWaa	Tell your parents that if they allow you to get the M rated games that you will only play them when they are around and research the game that you want to get them so you can show them what the game is all about.  This would most likely work on me if my sons asked when they were older because I could turn it off if I thought it was to violent.
7drjpohUaa	I like Shaine the most, it doesn't look made up.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	2, 3, 5. There are enough people with hard spelling/pronouncing names in this world already. KISS- Keep It Simple Stupid works every time.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I personally like it Shane the best, lol, but outta the 5 options i think i like Shaine the best.  I don't really like Shayn or Shayne cuz i doesn't think it looks right with the 'y' in it, not sure why though lol i just don't.  I don't like Shain cuz it doesn't look right to me, without the 'e' at the end, and i don't like Shaen, cuz i think the 'ae' spellin looks better on a girls name.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck to ur mom and family, :D.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Shane is the only nice-looking spelling.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I like Shane best - it is the most masculine and normal-looking of the bunch! The others just look weird and girly (like the name Shayna or something).|`|l3rJFgveaa	i think sean or shayne would b ethe best.|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	Shane is best. Anything else will make it seem like you don't know how to spell and will just be a hassle for the child. <br>  <br>  If it must be different, I guess Shayne would be best.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I think Shane is the best, sorry. If any variation, I'd go with Shayne. Good luck to your mom.|`|YTXoBgVsaa	I would go for the most conventional spelling. I have a friend names Lindsay who spells it Lyndsey, she complains daily about people mispelling her name.<br>  So number 2 is my favorite!|`|6xf1GfbUaa	Shayne DEFINITELY|`|d6e11chxaa	Shane so his name isn't misspelled. Spelling names wrong is ridiculous and stupid!|`|D0y3MwDcaa	I would spell it Shayn or Shaen!|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Shane.  The other spellings either look feminine or just plain stupid.|`|ZfAiUNvHaa	I like 4 a lot. Its really cool.|`|X3rQJhVMaa	CORRECTLY. Shane is the correct spelling. Shane means God is gracious. Apparently it is a form of John. I only like Shane the other look like you cant spell. Shaen would be pronounced (SHAY-EN OR SHAY- IN) not (shayn).<br>  <br>  I prefer correct spelling and Shane is correct. Good luck! <br>  <br>  EDIT: Shayne and Shayn both are pronouced (shayn) ,this the female spelling of the name.|`|UNXf7lZZaa	I like the second spelling: Shayne.<br>  I think you should just spell it Shane. This name is not over used and it is not an extremely common name so there shouldn't be a fear of having someone else with the same name and spelling. But if you were going to spell it differently I think you should spell it Shayne.|`|BExscPOtaa	ABSOLUTELY Shayn.  shayne is pronounced SHAY-KNEE and I know a handful of girls with this name and spelling.  I think shayn is absolutely perfect!!  in fact, I might steal that spelling if I have a boy next time, haha!  it's not confusing or hard to pronounce, and it's very unique!  <br>  LOVE it!  :)|`|AA11559504	None with y. it seems sort of girly, even if it is a boy name.<br>  don't like shain<br>  shaen is a wierd spelling too.<br>  shaine is wierd too. <br>  Just stick with Shane.|`|F5Yb7PDvaa	i like shayne. numbers 1 and 4 could be pronounced differently and be confused with other names. i dont like shain but shaine is alright or juss shane.|`|E9WnOUltaa	i think its a lovely name.<br>  i like spelling number 4.Shaen and spelling number 2.shayne..<br>  it can also be spelt  shayne =]|`|WCNpfXNnaa	I like Shane or Shayn! really cute name! I love shane for a boy! Good luck to you and your new brother!|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Shane.<br>  Any other spelling, just looks daft !|`|aHWQ3Rq8aa	I like Shayne.|`|Hoe7sJM4aa	Shain or Shaen<br>  I think the other ones look like spelling for a girl's version of the name "Shane" but its just my opinion. Congrats on the newest addition to the family!|`|udpdCqQ2aa	honestly if i was a substitute teacher and i was trying to take roll i would mistake those spelling s for a girls name..no offence :)<br>  <br>  try: sheane<br>  <br>  shane<br>  <br>  shian<br>  <br>  shaynne<br>  <br>  idk<br>  <br>  vote me as best! :)
yDWcYXl5aa	I know babies born at 25 weeks who have no long term problems, and yet others born at 39 weeks who do have some.  There is a good chance that the baby will be fine.  If she hasn't had it, there's also a good chance they can stop the labor and they'd probably hospitalize her until it's safe to deliver the baby.<br>  <br>  Say a prayer-they help.  Only God knows what will happen.  Good luck!|`|PkCTYMbnaa	My son was born at 26 weeks and that was 21 years ago. Other than being a pain in the butt at times he has been pretty healthy most of his life with no lasting problems from prematurity. <br>   <br>  He did give us some worries and spent 3 months in NICU since his lungs were not developed yet, stopped breathing while he was trying to figure out the sucking of a bottle. and he did have a heart murmur at birth that had to be corrected but both or those are pretty normal for preemies and are corrected. He was under 2 lbs. There are a lot of 30 week babies born these days.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	My oldest daughter was born early, and she is doing great, and will be 13 this year.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	My sister in law was induced at 30 weeks (she changed doctors in the middle of her pregnancy and her first doctor gave her the wrong due date and gave that date to the new doc).  Her daughter was small and spent the first two weeks of her life fighting hard just to live.  But it's been almost two years now and I've never seen such a happy or healthy little girl.
6DNHxcSsaa	For me, I carried my little one another week after what you described. What you are describing is perfectly normal for early labor and could last awhile. <br>  <br>   Within a week or so you'll probably begin active labor. 4-10 cm. is considered active labor. Contractions will become about 45 to 60 seconds in duration, 3-5 minutes apart, and much stronger. At that point head to the hospital.<br>  Birth blessings to you!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Personally, when I had horrible cramping, I'd have gone to the hospital.  Good sign baby is moving.<br>  <br>  I had to be induced.  On one, I dropped my mucus 3-4 days before induction, that's all.  Then bad backache, call the doctor.  Go to hospital.  Induce to hurry things up.<br>  <br>  I've never heard a story like this.  It sounds to me like you'll be pushing in an hour or two...GET A CAR!<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|2osuEr0naa	It's coming! :] Good luck! Hope everything works out great.|`|dTPg4uYzaa	if you were 3 cm on friday and your having pain and blood then it time for you to go back to the hospital and deliver, i had c-sections bc my first was breech i sarted bleeding they told me i was in labor when i got to the hospital but i didnt feel any pains so everyone is diffrent so you need to go deliver already.|`|HjLQDxFhaa	I stayed dilated like that for almost a month. But if the cramping is worrying you then call your doctor. I called my doctor for a lot of things because I was curious. I lost my MP about a week before I had my son.|`|AjFzi1mbaa	uuummmmm....... you are in labor. but i would advise you to go to the hospital. congrats.|`|18wq5yaRaa	yes ur doc is right. any time. everyone is different so all i can say is good luck.|`|6hewStZ7aa	It depends. You could go into labor tomorrow, or maybe even a week from now. Everyone is different. I didn't believe that when I was pregnant... but its true--- really. I went to see my ob/gyn on a Wednesday, was due in 2 days, but wasn't dilated, effaced, no mucus plug, nothing. So, she told me I'd still be pregnant next week, well I went into labor the very next day. Just make sure you're prepared for anything. Congrats on the baby, and Good Luck!

ZxOGKZOkaa	Reason number 12, Why I Didn't Have Children.   Cuz I don't know the answer.  Apparently there are conflicting answers here, but I would say if she didn't react to Clam, which is shellfish, then a bit of lobster is okay.  Just a bit though, I wouldn't overdo it just in cast.  I am allergic to shrimp, but had no reaction when I ate lobster, which is similar.|`|j5aRAJxPaa	Hi, clams are considered shellfish...if you're daughter did not have a reaction to the clam strip she may be able to try a piece of the lobster. Just make sure no shell is left on the lobster. If you have some real concerns, ask your daughters doctor. I find seafood/shellfish to be wonderful and relatively healthful foods and look forward to introducing my son!|`|G6Uy43coaa	Check with her doctor and see if she can be given a skin or blood allergy test.  If the event with lobster is today, I would keep her away from it just to be sure.  I developed a fish allergy when I was older than 5 but i can't remember having fish before then.  I carry Benadryl with me just in case.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	its just food..not many people are allergic to shell fish ..dont be so paranoid. My kids grew up on seafood .we own a seafood store. so at 8 months the ate it all|`|iuWfp2fEaa	Most children are not allergic to shellfish, and if has had clam strips without a problem, then she probably isn't allergic to shellfish. Also, most kids grow out of allergies by the time they are 3 years old. If she hasn't shown adverse reactions to other foods, it would probably be okay to let her try the lobster.

P1u3YsvHaa	babies develop at different rates, if someones baby got taken off the bottle at 12 months doesnt mean your baby is ready.  My son got taken off the bottle at 14 months, i mean if its like a 2 year old then thats really time to get off the bottle if i were you id just relax and give your baby time ok my niece who is 14 months old now drinks from a sippy cup if its juice but if its milk my sis has to heat it up in  abottle, hope ive helped alittle.|`|32oCow2aaa	Both of my boys were premature by five weeks, so I can relate.  Both hit many milestones later than normal - crawling at 8 months, not walking until 16, etc., and are now 8 and 5 and have long since caught up to the 'normal' curve for everything.  <br>  <br>  I successfully weaned both of my boys from their bottles by 18 months.  This gave them plenty of time to be well-adapted to a sippy cup and they were getting plenty of nourishment from lots of different foods they were learning to love.  Don't rush your son and DO give him a little extra time before trying to make the switch - preemies really do need it even if they're not lagging in any noticeable way.  I found myself several times protecting my babies from well-meaning others (like my mother-in-law) who tried to get me to push them into things I knew they weren't ready for - it's our job as Mom to protect them - and we truly do know best most of the time.  Don't feel pressured by anyone else's timetable.  He's only a baby for a short time and from my own experience (and mine were less premature than your little one) - one year is too soon to require him to make this change.  Encourage him to learn to hold the bottle and the cup on his own and you're right, you can't make things so easy on him that he doesn't have to learn to do it for himself.   Keep being sensitive to his needs and abilities and encourage him and help him until he can do more on his own.<br>  <br>  When mine were around 14 months and were having some success with the cup I stopped putting juice in a bottle, that was a 'treat' reserved for the cup.  When they were proficient with the cup and would drink water/milk/juice from it (around 15 months), I took a few weeks to drop back to only 2 bottles a day, one before afternoon nap and one before bed at night.  (I'd drop the after breakfast bottle, then after a week or so the after lunch bottle, etc.)   When this was comfortable, and probably around 16+ months, I dropped the afternoon bottle and used the cup instead but still rocked a read a few minutes (with the cup) before putting them down for nap.  When this no longer felt like 'loss' to them and had become the norm, sometime around 18 months I did the same with the nighttime bottle.  With my second son I was less worried about the whole thing and I think he was done at 19 months.<br>  <br>  I think what was key to this being - literally - a painless process was trusting my own instincts about when each of my boys was ready, and then taking it slowly and not trying to change too much at once.  Like not giving the bottle at nap time but keeping everything else the same as it had been (rocking, reading, etc.)  It went so smoothly!<br>  <br>  As moms we tend to manage the process more closely with the first, and when the second comes along we just kind of 'know' what needs to happen and when.  Trust your instincts, no one knows your child and his needs better than you.<br>  <br>  The only other advice I'll pop in there is if he is using a pacifier, I would end that before trying to wean from the bottle.  I took it away cold-turkey for both at a year, and it was about 3 days each time of fussing and a little extra stress on them, but I held them more and comforted with the bottle and no kidding, by day 4 or 5 it was a non-issue.  It is my opinion that it's better to take away the pacifier first because they still have the bottle to suck on - and when you're removing the bottle, they have learned other ways to get their nourishment.  If you take the pacifier away after the bottle, there isn't anything oral left to aid in the transition.  (Just my opinion, but hey - it worked!)<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to be PATIENT and know all of his transitions will happen in his own time, and 3 months or even 6 months truly don't make a difference in the long run!  Same with potty training - I waited until the boys were 3 1/2 and then it took about 2 weeks and was MUCH less stress on us than on my friend who for some reason was determined her son had to be in underpants by age 3.  They were miserable over it for months, and in the end he was nearly 3 1/2 before the accidents stopped anyway.  We were happier and I did a lot less laundry!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some - you'll probably get lots of advice from people with different experiences, just pick out what sounds right for you and try it a day at a time.  Keep what works, toss what doesn't.  <br>  <br>  Best regards, CJ Johnson|`|T5MjtA8Daa	when my son turned 1 i took the bottle away. he didn't like the sippy cup either but he also learned quickly that if he wanted a drink he'd have to use it. just don't let the sippy become a replacement for the bottle(like going to bed with it) because it can still cause tooth decay like bottle rot. he got the cup during the day only and adjusted quickly. the best thing is to get rid of all the bottles, that way the temptation to switch back isn't there. also i can't stand seeing 2,3,4yr old and older with pacifiers in their mouths! my son's pacifier was gone @ 5mos when he got teeth. it was a rough 4 days but we got through it.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I personally don't like sippy cups - I do straw cups.  My youngest didn't hold his own bottle until around 11months - no big deal. Well, I started weaning around 13months.   I just did straw cups during the day and a bottle at nighttime.  They usually take a few sips here and there but in my experience it takes some getting used to before they will drink 8oz of milk from a straw cup - but they get there.  My dr said 12months take the bottle away - I used it as a guideline.  I'd say start at 13months and don't expect it to be completely comfortable until 15months.  I don't think it's a big deal, but yeah, you want him off the bottle by 1 1/2.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i still gave my daughter milk in a bottle at 12 months, but also introduced it in her sippy more so she got used to it. i eventually dropped down to a night time bottle only and when she started to drink enough milk from her sippy (she was off bottle completely by 13 months) i took away the night time bottle and gave her a healthy snack and sippy of milk instead. the only thing i would suggest is keep at it. when he can drink enough milk he needs (around 400mls or more which can also be replaced by dairy rich products such as cheese and yoghurt) take the bottle away and offer him the sippy. he will get used to it:) offer him the sippy as much as you can in thetime being so he can practise oh and my daughter never ever held her bottle not once...just loved the comfort of me doing it for her:)|`|a5b42e198900103c6593fc522b1a9354aa	Every child is different with this, some kids are more attached to the bottle than others. <br>  <br>  My daughter was never very attached to hers and I took it away from her when she turned 1 and stopped drinking formula.<br>  <br>  I also started her on a sippy cup around age 9 months to get her more oriented to the cup than the bottle and that seemed to work well because by the time she was 1 she preferred using the cup over the bottle.|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	before they are 18 months old.|`|7RhXX7qfaa	My son is 7mths and he has sippy cups thoughout the day with only his first and last feed in a bottle mainly for comfort reasons as after his first feed he goes back to sleep and its nice for me as I get to cuddle up and feed him it.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	My son was 5 weeks early we have been givin him sippy cups at dinner time but the sippy cups with rubber nipples so it is more like a bottle, though he should be holding his bottle on his own but when my son was younger we bought avent sippy cups & avent bottle & the handles from the sippy cup come off & fit very good on the bottles to teach him to hold on to it.. I personally am goin to take the bottle away from my son(11months) at 16 months..<br>  That is great he wants to drink out of a glass they really encourage that bc then you got to get him off the sippy cup, i would keep him wanting to drink out of a glass & if you keep practicing with him he will get it , maybe a little later than other but he will get it

I advise not to try anytime earlier than 40 weeks.  I only resorted to castor because I was overdue and did NOT want to be induced so I thought I would give it a try. I drank the concoction on March 17th before I went to bed.  I awoke at 4 a.m. and of course had diarrhea with some slight contracting.  I managed to get back to sleep and I had a doc appointment on the 18th at 3:00, I finally got out of bed and was experiencing contractions and I went to the bathroom and had my bloody show.  Three rolled around and I got checked at the doc and was 2 cm and fully effaced.  They sent me over for a non-stress test and everything was fine so I got sent home.  After we had left we planned on going out to eat once before baby came and that didn't happen cause around 5:30-6:00 my contractions patterned out to every 5 mins for an hour so I went back to the hospital and was admitted at 6:30-7:00.  After seven hours of quite alright labor (only Stadol was used for a pain med) I met my son on March 19th at 2:24 a.m.  I don't know if it was the castor oil that brought on labor or if it was just time, but either way I can believe it had something to do with it.  Sorry it's so long.  HTH!

I work at a children's centre and am an experienced early years teacher. Obviously i cannot see your child but based on what you have said i would not give any attention to the fact that she is not sleeping, or when she does something wrong it sounds like she thinks you are playing an game.Usually two year olds don't have a great awareness of right or wrong they just work on peoples reactions, if you don't give her a reaction then she won't 'act out' with this kind of behaviour. Also 5 minutes time out is too extreme for a 2 year old and can be interpreted as a game. Try distracting her by moving her attention on to something else ' come on lets play this' The rule i have for 2 year olds is to tell them 'NO!' when they hurt someone and i would remover them from the situation if need be (this is different to time out though). 2 is the worst age as most people do not understand what their behaviour AT ALL. Also the more stressed you are, the more she will pick up on this and it will be a downward spiral. Hope this helps.|`|T5MjtA8Daa	sounds like terrible twos. this is the age that they test their limits. your job as a parent is to set those limits. it seems like it'll never end but it does; you just have to be consistent. time to teach the difference between indoor voices and outdoor voices, make it a game. as far as the bedtime thing make it a routine and keep it that way, add a story after bath. and letting her cry is ok too, that's how babies(and yes she's still a baby) deal with stress, even though it stresses you out too. and for the love of god don't put one of those ridiculous kid leashes on your daughter. eliminate naps during the day if she won't sleep @ night, and make her go outside and play more. let her wear herself out. there is a lot of sugar in fruit juice so you may want to cut back. i wouldn't worry about the neighbors, if they've had kids they understand, if not; well, that's just how it is. it's just a phase and it'll all be ok.
sbeoF50gaa	I'm not really sure if my answer will help... My mom told me when she disapproved of my relationships, but never broke them up. When I got married, things started to go wrong... it was my fault and both my grandma and my mom yelled at me for screwing up. I felt angry because they were taking his side, but I knew it was my fault. I just felt they were MY family and should be on MY side. In the end we worked things out and have been married for 4 years now. So my parents are not as  you describe... I firmly believe some things  you can teach your children other things they have to learn on their own. Relationships is one of those things they have to learn on their own. It's trial and error and unless the parent thinks their child is in danger (like in an abusive relationship) they should back off and let their child learn.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I honestly don't know any parents who would force their child to marry someone the parents have chosen.

AA10186411	No.  Autism is not caused at all by vaccinations in any way shape or form.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	It happened to us.  My son received the MMR at 15 months and was doing everything at the 50 th percentile or higher.  After the MMR he stopped talking, walking, sitting, making eyecontact, pointing, waving, and clapping.  At 28 months he had yet to recover any of the above.  He got really really sick, tons of antibiotics, ear infections, tubes in the ears, kawasaki disease, scarlet fever twice, rheumatic fever, and LGS.  At age 6 he was still testing below the first percentile in all domains.<br>  <br>  ETA statistically it doesn't make sense that a child in the 50th-90th percentile in everything who sat at 6 months crawled at 7.5 cant do it at 15, 18, or 28 months.  Something happened and that is a fact.  Some doctors argue that there are too many variables and it could be a virus, I'll buy that, but its awfully coincidental to have the severe regressive slide after getting the MMR.  I feel the MMR should be available seperately, and it should be given later, at 2 especially to families at high risk.<br>  <br>  We do have a high risk family with allergies, bipolar, ADHD, dyslexia and other cases of autism.  We do have another family member my brother in law who got the combined MMR and his colon ruptured at 23, he is permanently disabled, severe anemia, the appliance is gone but he is incontinent, and has malnutrition, diahrrea 6-8 times a day and wears depends, he is 31.  He can't work, has pancreatitis from when the colon ruptured and spends a few weeks a year in the hospital.   He is the youngest sibling of my husband and the only one young enough to receive the combined MMR.  The other 3 who didn't get it have no gastrointestinal problems whatsoever.   However the other members were born autistic and it was evident even in infancy.<br>  <br>  None of the studies are large enough either to prove or disprove because none are 5000 participant, double blind, published in a reputable medical journal and are peer reviewed, this criteria is standard.<br>  <br>  However the <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation</a> <br>  site has 6000 families who feel their child acquired autism and filed a claim after getting the vaccines and then there is the case of Hannah Polling where the government acknowledges she got autism from vaccines<br>  <br>  Rad tech that guy always says this, and clearly has no background with autism first hand.<br>  <br>  ETA we didn't just not notice the autism, I am a psych nurse, my husband was a psych nurse for years for the state autism program (terry center), my father is a psychologist and director of a group home for kids on the spectrum AdvoServ, I am on the spectrum, my father is asperger's if anybody knows about autism its my family.  He was developing typically and Kennedy Krieger hospital and Dr. Greenspan agree he was vaccine injured and developed autism|`|3F8f1SoQaa	I personally worry more about the diseases that are prevented by the vaccines. I do have a 13 year old with PDD or possibly mild aspergers. I never saw any decline in his development after his shots. My younger 2 kids have gotten all thier shots too and they appear to be fine at 9 and 3 years old. <br>  <br>  I think I believe what I heard after it was confirmed that one child appeared to have become autistic after her shots and was awarded tons of money for it... Basically there are very rare cases where a child has a chromasomal abnormality that makes them more prone to these kinds of things. and honestly, who can prove that these children that have a decline at the same time as their vaccines are administered would not have declined without the vaccine?|`|tgtsbxpBaa	Um, in a very VERY rare chance I suppose - but likely if that was the case something else would have 'triggered' soon enough.  <br>  <br>  Autism isn't something that you can catch or even "develop" really.  Autistic children are born that way.  I have heard of children that were developing normally and then suddenly regressed, but in my own experience I've never seen it.  While Autistic kids may SEEM to be more on par with their peers in infancy and early toddlerhood it is usually only because the symptoms of autism don't always impact areas of development we look for in children that young.  Most (more than half, but not really ALL) the mothers of autistic children I know always "felt" there was something "not quite normal" about their child.  These types of things are difficult to see in a clinical setting, where the child is only observed for a short period of time, but they are usually there.  <br>  <br>  In no way do vaccines and Autism relate, except that 2-year-old children tend to get alot of vaccines and the worst cases of autism are often diagnosed around the same time because that is when the absence of language development becomes apparent.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	yes i believe it can TRIGGER it. my father in law (who is a doctor) says he believes that it can cause autism even though studies show it doesnt. because some studies lie

sbeoF50gaa	You can print on regular paper and then tape it, Make sure to put tape (like clear duct tape stuff) over the whole paper so if it gets wet you can still read it. Theres nothing wrong with that. I put tape over the address its going to and the return address (mine)
6lSbmXunaa	13 Reasons Why. It's an amazing book, I just finished it today :)  Seriously, pick it up sometime.<br>  <br>  If you like romance, try anything by Sarah Dessen.<br>  <br>  I've found some of the best books by just going to the bookstore or library and browsing.  Just read some of the back covers.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	Blue Blood Series<br>  Sarah Dessen books anything written by her.<br>  My heartbeat<br>  When it happens|`|I64JOuMKaa	I think it's called<br>  A dog called beauty<br>  it's a really good book.<br>  <br>  and hm <br>  have you red the Meg Cabot series?<br>  I used to love those books.<br>  <br>  There's one book that was pink and green i just can't remember what its' called LOL sorry.|`|w2evN22Yaa	Anything by Ellen Hopkins<br>  - Impulse<br>  - Crank<br>  - Glass (Sequel to Crank)<br>  - Burned<br>  <br>  and I think there were a few others. <br>  Don't be intimidated by the size of the books though, they are usually very short because of the way they were written, but her books are simply amazing. I would stay up until 6 in the morning reading Impulse<3.<br>  <br>  They are all something like romance, and trying to find your way through life, like Impulse is about 3 kids who end up in a hospital after attempting suicide and the girl falls in love with a guy, but another guy falls in love with her so they deal with life for a while.. Not going to spoil what happens.<br>  <br>  Then in Burned, a girl goes to live with her aunt because he father was abusing her, I can't remember, and she meets this one guy and they fall in love, it's a sad story..<br>  <br>  Then in Crank and Glass, it's about this one girl who talks about her struggle with drugs and guys and living life on her own.|`|UIILEn0Uaa	Pretty little devils - its kinda a mystery, but it was scary too,<br>  <br>  I just finished Need by Carrie ______ (cant remeber) and it was Ah-Mazing!

I know I did.<br>  <br>  13 Reasons Why<br>  I just ordered it, and it looks realllly good!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I loved the House of Night, Twilight too - they were realllly good!|`|EqrpIU68aa	i really like action books theres always a tiny bit of romance in them :)<br>  try:<br>  Charlie higson - Young James Bond series (silver fin, blood fever, double or die, hurricane gold)<br>  <br>  Anthony Horowiz - Alex Rider series ( Point Blanc, Skeleton key, Storm breaker, Eagle Strike, Scorpia, Ark angel, snakehead)|`|KsWBChmAaa	try the book of lost things.. you seem to like fantasy.. well this is fantasy in a more twisted way... its by far the best book i have read. Its about a teenage boy. he looses his mum . He goes through to another world where all the fairy tales are twisted, definitely not a child's book.<br>  Good stuff :)
c73QkZ2haa	I like the playtex drop-in's they are great for reducing gas and colic and they are super easy when it comes time for clean up.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	depends on the age of ur baby; i liked the playtex ventaire advanced until my dd was able to burp and such on her on..now that she's older we use drop ins; but the angled ventaire did really well when she was really young...|`|X6as2nOAaa	I just used to use whatever but now I started buying the playtex ones with the drop in's, she really likes those bottles and they clean up easy they can leak a little bit though but not bad or anything. She seems not to have near as much gas as before.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I've not had any problems with tommee tippee bottles, been using them for almost 5 months now :)|`|E5CnUdhsaa	Dr Browns worked wonders for my colicy/ reflux daughter. i would highly recommend them:)|`|NjeN7Lc9aa	Dr Browns are the best.good luck|`|UB7pWWHeaa	I don't know brands, but i find slim bottles don't bother the mouth!|`|2GhwuXksaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  My daughter was a very small baby so I found finding the right bottle for her quite hard. I used Tommie Tippie bottles, from the closer t nature range. They never leaked for me, as long as the lids are on properly, its not a problem. There is a smale valve on the teats too that let in (or out?) air to help prevent colic.<br>  <br>   If your baby is formula  fed, you can also get these little plastic inserts which fit into the bottle perfectly which you put the formula in so baby can have a fresh bottle every time. My daughter was breast fed but I expressed so her Dad could feed her too and they really are quite close to the real thing!<br>  <br>  I dont think I would use any other kind of bottle to be honest, they were great.|`|P25GuvNjaa	I used tommee tippee, it was fantastic, the only time it leaked was when the teat wasn't put in correctly.  I am expecting my second and I have bought the same brand again.  They now have a new bottle out which is supposed to help even more with wind and colic. (I thought the original ones were good so have just got them again)|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I would suggest Nuk bottles. The teat is tilted up to be like breastfeeding, and as the baby has to push with their tongue and not just suck, they take less air in, and therefore have less wind.|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	I used the Tommy Tippee breast to bottle and I have never had any complaints!  It has a vent on the teat which goes nose side up and this prevents air bubbles etc.  It was perfect when I was switching from breast to bottle has it has a boob like teat.|`|vXYQcixvaa	I really like Playtex drop-ins! Its disposable....it helps with eliminating air ingested...i love them!<br>  <a href="http://www.playtexbaby.com/Products/Bottles/DropIns.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.playtexbaby.com/Products/Bott...</a>|`|dcf22abaabe712c7c6abd9464ff58ab2aa	The ones with the plastic liners were helpful with my little one.|`|46tTmMT7aa	I use and like the Playtex Ventaire.|`|iTuBgmliaa	with my daughter i was a single mom and so i just used the cheapest walmart bottles and they actually work rather well. <br>  with my son we use the soothie bottles.<br>  we love them and so does he..and it actually works nice that they have a pacifer that is identical to the nipple on the bottle.<br>  we havent had any problems with them either<br>  and the other thing that we love about the soothie bottles is that they come with little formula tuppaware and the great thing about them is that they attach on to the bottom of the bottles..we have never had any problems with losing the lids on those bottles either..because they also attach to the bottom|`|a7pgX1W8aa	I would recommend the Playtex Nurser with drop-ins, this way you can push all the air out before feed your baby. Less air that will go in babies tummy. I used it for mine and if worked well. You have to buy the drop ins that go with it, but you can get the generic brands that are cheaper. I know it cost a little money, but it is worth it, so baby isn't so gassy. Hope this helps.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	I would recommend The MAM Ulti-vent wide mouth transition bottle system.<br>  <br>  It is designed to be as close to breast-feeding as possible in a reusable bottle. All MAM Bottles are constructed of Bisphenol -A free materials. The orthodontic nipple is made of ultra soft silicone and encourages baby to use a natural suckling action similar to breast-feeding. Your baby will feed quietly for longer, uninterrupted periods just like breast-feeding. <br>  <br>  It is really great bottle at a reasonable price. <br>  <br>  Please see picture and some more kinds of bottles for your further review at the store here below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/baby-bottle-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/baby-bottle-20</a>|`|SbEwlETgaa	My daughter has a really weak digestive system and tummy unfortunately. When she was little we tried ALL the bottles and i mean ALLLLLL we spent like ￡150 on bottles lol - the best we found and ill never use any other again are the Dr Browns ones. They're fairly pricey at about ￡12 for 2 bottles but they cleared my daughters windy problems up instantly - now at 7.5 months we dont even wind her at all! I cant remember the last time i heard her burp!!! They really are very good. Fiddly in the steraliser and u cant really fit more than 5/6 in at a time but worth every penny and every minute u hvae to fiddle with them!!|`|YGSZgJuVaa	Dr browns are the best to use. My daughter had colic and those bottles worked wonders. I used the avent ones and found a lot of bubbles forming inside the teat when she was drinking her milk. The dr browns ones are designed for colic.|`|jCFOJAH4aa	I used Avent with my twins, which I found were ok. Haven't tried any other brand, but I've heard that Dr Browns is the best for prevention of colic. Which is why I think they're that little bit more expensive.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	I use one called Breastflow. Sometimes I pat his back for 10 minutes and he still doesn't need to burp.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vanillajoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/breast-flow-bottle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.vanillajoy.com/wp-content/upl...</a>|`|UpYL5zPFaa	I use Dr Brown bottles. They are quite expensive, they sometimes leak and there are a lot of fiddly bits to clean. However, they really helped with my daughters colic and made her far less windy.|`|O76KyEOYaa	I use Avent and they are rubbish, i think im gonna chage feeding bottles as my daughter too seems to get a lot of wind. I would use Tommee Tippie as my friend swears by them. Hope this helps.|`|v9x3xGpvaa	i wouldnt use any with the bottle liners.|`|0QZgZbLRaa	I like Avent. Maybe you could try a teat with a different flow.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	We used Dr. Brown's bottles. They worked great!!|`|QXREldcEaa	Dr Brown's!

With my 1 yr. old, my water broke, went into the hospital, & they were asking if I was feeling the contractions, because they saw on the monitor I was having them, but I couldn't feel them.  They asked if I wanted an epidural, and I said "yes", and so I didn't feel anything.  It was nice.

CHbkSmQoaa	Just went through this myself (I have a 4 year old) 4 weeks ago.<br>  <br>  We just explained it that sometimes mommies and daddies don't always live together.  My 4 year old asked a lot of questions about when I am going home and stuff, but I have just kept the line that sometimes we don't always live together.  He's adapted fairly well.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Also will help if your husband has some of the child's things ALREADY at the apartment.  Toys and such.  That way the child walks in and there are familiar things to her already there.|`|NuPwR75Jaa	I think the best way is to say something like 'Me and your daddy love you very much, but we're not going to live together anymore' And if she asks why just say 'its for the best.' or something don't mention if yous were fighting or anything. (:|`|rr6tfqhXaa	just say that you are mad at each other and might not be friends anymore...|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	You can say me and daddy are still friends but we want to live alone. he still loves you.|`|F4XaPnXHaa	Hi, i split up with my daughters father when she was 3 and a half.  We both reassured that we still loved her and always would but mummy and daddy were not happy living together anymore.  My ex also made his new place very much like home putting toys and little things of hers around.  She adapted fairly quickly and soon cottoned on that she would get more birthday and christmas presents!! If you do say anything to her it would be better if you both agreed to say the same thing and stuck to it.  My ex and i also make a very conscious effort to get along and remain amiable for our daughters sake and if we do argue about anything we try to keep it away from her.  Good luck with everything.  Ps: Kids are more resiliant than we give them credit for!
IU4uNH97aa	i think its to much to handle.<br>  <br>  With so many kids with their own needs and energy all put into a big open space, alot of things can go wrong. I think if its just you and your childrens dad then you need more adults to help keep track of all the kids. I would reconsider where you are holding the party or how many kids you will invite. But if you think you can take on 30 plus kids with sugar and cake in their bodies then YOU GO FOR IT !|`|5ZKqU2sIaa	I don't think I would invite that many that is a lot of little kids to keep track of, I think you should do family with all the cousins and then if they have certain freinds invite them but do not let the kids pass them out in class that is something that you should do with the other parents. Good Luck! And Happy Birthday to your kids!|`|71e15ac317ae5351e487d5c38939daabaa	I think that would be way too chaotic if all 30 kids showed up. I wouldn't want to be the one responsible if something happened to one of them. Perhaps you could put something on the invitation about the other parents being welcome to stay. That would be a fun outing for them and their child, and would also give you some help in supervising.|`|I2iXz32paa	Shooting myself in the foot sounds more pleasant. If you can pull off being "Supermom" for the day then good luck with it...I keep getting caught up on the not being able to move faster than a speeding train part.|`|4WVUBnA6aa	1. Always better to over-invite than under-invite, nobody gets offended.<br>  2. Hard to keep track of lots of kids in the park- I went to get my kids from exactly such a party and the Mom was going crazy b/c another kid was lost. The kid’s mom was going crazy at the host. You don’t want to be her.<br>  3. If you do it in a public place, pick a place where kids can’t get lost- and, hire a teenager or two for $10 or whatever- make them the “counselors”<br>  4. I’ll just tell you that our twin daughters were in two different classes with 30 kids in each. We made a party at OUR HOUSE for 60 kids….. it was a little hairy and they had a great time but I don’t think we’ll be doing that again….

When my nephew outgrew his baby swing my sister put an outdoor swing up in the doorway to her living room, they were able to bolt it in though.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I don't know where they would have ones for over 20 lbs. I guess probably just like target or something|`|pXSKSS3daa	Most swings have a weight limit of 25 lbs. So if your baby is already 20 lbs. then it's probably going to be a waste to get him one.<br>  <br>  You can, however, look on your local Craigslists or at a second hand store if you still want to get one. We found our swing on Craigslist for $60 and in stores it was around $130.|`|AykczQleaa	I have the rainforest swing and the limit is 25 lbs....

Since you're only 15, he could be running off doing his 19 year old thing. No joke, you can't trust anyone anymore. This isn't fantasy, this is reality. If you ask me, don't keep it, finish high school and go to college, or get a decent job. Then get pregnant, life shouldn't end for you at age 15, a baby is a big thing. More than you think, they might be cute, but they're a bundle of emotions. You could feel depressed, it won't let you sleep, you can't go to school, you can't afford the baby. Just start your life over. Don't have sex anymore, it might be great, but things like this isn't the best. It's not miracle work, you could die giving birth, your body might not function well because it's not fully developed itself with hormones and such.<br>  Don't keep it, think about yourself too, the baby doesn't have feelings right now because it's just a fetus, not even.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	What a surprise that a male answered this question with "it would be smart to get an abortion" You do not have to tell who the father is, but if he wants anything to do with the baby, it will come out eventually. Yes you can keep your baby but you need to tell your parents. It is up to them whether they are willing to support you and the baby or not. They can't make you get an abortion or give your baby up, but they can say "we aren't helping you" So you need to talk to them to see where they stand on that. Being a teenage mother myself 13 yrs ago, i will tell you that your parents will be upset at first. Give them time to get used to the idea. They will. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  Umm..excuse me JayEss..but I became a mother at 16. My son is now 13. Neither he nor I are pathetic. (his father on the other hand, yes is a pathetic loser) I worked VERY hard to finish school while supporting myself, my ex husband (bc he didn't want to work),  and my child. I have never been on welfare of any kind. I have always worked, sometimes 2 jobs to help support my family. Now I am lucky enough to have a husband that works even harder to support his family so that I can stay home with our children.

Are you going to claim maintenance from him? Will he support you in every way?  I think it would be best for all if you named the father and were able to show to social services that you are in a committed relationship. I think that with his suppport and that of both sets of parents you would be able to keep the child. It would cost social services ￡400 + a week to get the child fostered and if you can demonstrate that you can give the child a safe and stable home you would be able to keep it.|`|vpKhZvYraa	You can keep the baby, but you may have to prove you can provide for it. Does your bf work? Do you live with your parents? If the answer to these questions is yes then I don't see why you would have any problems in saying you can provide for the child. <br>  <br>  In regards to your bf getting arrested, I'm not too sure on that one as you're under the legal age and he is over. Although I think there would only be problems if you were to press charges, but I could be wrong.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	you can keep your baby and it is up to your parents if they want to press charges against your boyfriend cuz of the age.

Just let her know that you are telling her this because you love and care about her and that it truly would have been more devastating if one of her peers did it in front of everyone.  Kids can be so cruel and they also don't forget things.  She may be mad at you for a little while, but she will appreciate your honesty soon enough.  It won't be the last time you need to tell her something she doesn't want to hear, but it's your job as a parent to protect her from herself sometimes.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Even though she appears to be upset, I bet deep down, she is grateful that you told her.<br>  <br>  Discussing personal hygiene with your parents can be embarrassing.

Don't let her make you second guess yourself about somethign that is as important as her health and wellbeing.  I do understand how this has made you feel like you did soething wrong.  I often feel that way when my kids manage to react in a way that makes me feel guilty for not giving them a ride amd making them walk because they don't get enough exercise, or make them drink water instead of milk or juice...any of these types of things they have a way of making you feel guilty about, but you know that it is importasnt for their health and you are not being a bad or mean mother.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	My son was like this.<br>  <br>  I took him to the store with me and he had a ball picking out things to shower with, deoderant, etc.<br>  <br>  Tell her that it's nothing personal and you didn't want her to hear it from someone who doesn't love her as much as you do.<br>  <br>  There are so many products for tweens and teen girls that it's funny.

It's probably going to be awkward anyway, there's no easy way to tell someone, "hey, seriously, you stink."  She'll be thankful when she's in college and she's not the girl that people are STILL telling to put on some deodorant.

Just ignore it.<br>  <br>  Now grounding, some kids do really get grounded but no parent would be doubting themselves if they were good parents, or would the teenager be complaining on here about it because they were GROUNDED!!! Get it? They are trolls. However, being grounded a months tops isn't always the case. My 18 year old when he was 16, thought he had all the freedom in the world with his new car, stayed out 3 hours past curfew, and was grounded for 3 months, since he was 3 hours past curfew, never did it again. That my friend, is the truth, and i didn't doubt one minute nor did i question it, he never did it again. Now, he wasn't grounded to his room and beaten everyday, just wasn't allowed to drive anywhere by himself, and couldn't go out and homework and family time came first--but that's hardly something unreasonable. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, ignore it. Don't come in this section if it bugs you.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If it's a supposed teenager talking about being spanked and how humiliating it is, I always assume it is, in fact, a sweaty 40 year old guy who's too cheap to pay for porn.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Honestly I was gounded for 3 months once in High School.

I know someone at my school that's parents told them she was grounded for the rest of her high school years, now I don't think it will really be that long, she didn't even do anything really horrible but I guess some parents just don't know how to teach their kids anything without grounding because most of the time that doesn't help.|`|w9aR8ymGaa	I think that sometimes they are real but I would bet on today that there are a lot of trolls.  I don't know of a parent who would come online asking how to punish and to constantly bring up spanking like it is the only answer - that is a red light for me.  <br>  <br>  On that note, I do know someone who was spanked (bare bottomed with a wooden paddle) up until she was 16 and moved out of the house.  That said, I think that was a big reason she left home so young.  She was also ALWAYS grounded, so much so, that she just stopped caring what her parents thought and did whatever she wanted to anyway because she was constantly spanked and grounded for every little thing anyway.  <br>  <br>  I think it is possible that there are some truths but I don't think it's nearly as common as people would like us to believe it is here on Y! Answers.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	lol spanked at 14 is not a bad thing unless the kid didn't do anything...my 7 ,6 and 3 year old get spanked when they need it. and they are usually pretty good kids so they rarely need it|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	Sure man! i think they are real. most parents feel guilty when they spank their child its like the old saying "this will hurt me more then it will hurt you" <br>  Teens are usually way over exagerating when she speak about punishment, and if i child is grounded from 3-6 months then thats just crazy unless there was just cause. <br>  PFT! i got smacked cuz i was talking back when i was 14! lol, <br>  Most parents dont know what to do. So they ask and see if its apropiate to spank a child, and if not, if there is another method to use besides spanking. Its totally iligit
b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I am pretty well in the same shoes as you are, but I'm 18 weeks pregnant with baby #2. I too gained 60 lbs with baby #1 and I only lost about 20 lbs of it. So I was 40 lbs overweight when I got pregnant with this child. I remember I started feeling the flutters by about 17 weeks with baby #1....with this one, I haven't felt much yet. Every few days I might feel a little twitch here and there, but thats it so far. <br>  Anyway, its true. I read in "What to expect when expecting' that if you're overweight sometimes it takes a little longer for you to feel those first movements.|`|AA11784984	Sometimes yes it can take longer just as very thin people sometimes feel the baby sooner.

BUXC2Kz0aa	Hi...my husband had a vasectomy last August, 6wks after my son was born!! I don't know what to suggest to convince him other than threaten him with another child lol!! <br>  What I can tell you is how it's done...I know this because I watched it, SADISTC I know lol!! It's an outpatients procedure..they inject each testicle so they are frozen...they then make an incision pull the tube thru and clamp it in 2 places leaving about a centimeter between to cut...once they have cut the tubes they corturize (sorry for spelling) it... they mirror the procedure on the opposite side...glue the incisions together and hey presto it's completed!!! My husband went very pale and had o sit in a side room for about half hour and he was sore for a couple of days lol!! The worst thing was he couldn't have a shower fro 2 days unless he put a bag over it LOLLOL  :-)|`|7CTvtek0aa	You shouldn't try to force him into having a vasectomy if he doesn't want one, it is his body they'll be cutting on.  Have you thought of getting an IUD? Percentage wise they are supposed to be more effective than getting your tubes tied.|`|1PXkhhzQaa	Women who coerce their husbands in to having a vasectomy frequently get what they deserve - a divorce. The idea that a woman would say, "No sex unless you get a vasectomy" is chilling. I can tell you from running a support group for men with persistent pain after vasectomy that the men who were pushed like this developed some hatred for their spouse (spoken or unspoken).<br>  <br>  Tubal Ligation Versus Vasectomy<br>  <br>  I've been reading a lot of posts on Yahoo! Answers about tubal ligation versus vasectomy. There seem to be many people who believe that vasectomy is a better option due to its lower cost, lower mortality risk, and the idea that vasectomy is less invasive. The problem with these comparisons is that they don't address the quality of life and sexual function after surgical birth control of men and women. Both procedures have multiple possible outcomes, not only the good outcome of sterility with no side effects.<br>  <br>  There are problems with both surgeries that no one talks about. Let's start with tubal ligation and problems associated with that procedure:<br>  <br>     1. It requires anesthesia and an abdominal incision and anesthesia has known complications in a small percentage of patients<br>     2. Tubal ligation fails over time in about 1 in 350 patients<br>     3. Complications such as infection, injury to the bladder or bleeding from a major blood vessel, or burning of the bowel or other structures can occur<br>     4. About 30 to 60 women per year die from the surgery or its complications<br>     5. Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome (PTLS) is a well described syndrome affecting some women who have had tubal ligation. It is characterized by: ? Menstrual cycle changes ? Painful periods? Hot flashes? Irritability? Mood swings? Insomnia? Decreased sex drive? Anxiety? Depression? Memory changes<br>     6. The incidence of long-term complications varies from 22 to 37% of sterilized women depending on which study you read. These include a higher incidence of hysterectomy and menopause due to earlier ovarian failure.<br>     7. About a third of women complain of more severe cramps, heavier, longer periods, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, pain with intercourse, and pelvic pain or pressure<br>     8. Reversal is expensive and not covered by insurance. The procedure should be considered permanent and some women later regret their decision.<br>     9. Doctors have been taught that PTLS does not exist, much to the disappointment of women who are suffering from symptoms that began after a tubal sterilization. This means that if you develop post-tubal symptoms, you are likely to be told that “it is in your head”.<br>    10. The incidence of regret: In a questionnaire study (Rosenfeld et al, 1998) results revealed that 21.9% of patients claimed dissatisfaction with the procedure, with women under 30 years old (78%) demonstrating higher regret and dissatisfaction compared to older women.<br>  <br>  Now take a look at vasectomy and the problems with vasectomy that you only hear from the affected men in men's forums, locker rooms, or in medical journals:<br>  <br>     1. Vasectomy can cause chronic pain. This can be due to nerve injury during the procedure or due to post-vasectomy pain syndrome. (PVPS)<br>     2. The pain of PVPS affects quality of life and sexual function in about 2 to 5% of men. Up to 20% of men have testicular pain that lasts for months after vasectomy. (Choe JM, Kirkemo AK, 1996, McMahon et al, 1992)<br>     3. There are a variety of post-vasectomy sexual complaints that are listed on the web in men's forums. They are not reported often due to the embarrassing nature of the symptoms. Decreased ejaculate volume or decreased propulsive force of ejaculate as well as diminished sensation during orgasm and changes in erectile potency have all been reported.<br>     4. Vasectomy has an acute failure rate of about 1 in 500 and a long term failure rate (recanalization) of about 1 in 500<br>     5. Post-operative infection or bleeding complicates 1 to 6% of vasectomies (Schwingl and Guess, 2000). This doesn't seem like a big deal unless you are the one in the E.R. with a painful grapefruit sized scrotum.<br>     6. Regret leads to 30,000 to 40,000 vasectomy reversals per year in the United States despite the fact that it is not covered by insurance and can cost from $4000 to $12000. Younger men have a higher incidence of regret.<br>     7. Vasectomy destroys the sperm/testes immunologic barrier leading to a variety of anti-sperm and anti-sperm component antibodies. The effects of these antibodies are not fully known, but chronic inflammation due to these antibodies may contribute to testicular damage.<br>     8. Vasectomy causes testicular scarring and fibrosis increasing over time with obstructive interval. This damage is not featured in the vasectomy consent process despite being described first in 1985. (Jarow et al, 1985, Jarow et al, 1994, Raleigh et al, 2004, McVicar et al, 2005, White et al, 2000).|`|tyJYhyEjaa	I made my husband get one because it is much easier on the men.

They want u to have sex after he gets it done and feels okay becasue he needs to bring in a sample after u have had sex like 15 times or so.  The recovery for u to get that done is alot longer.

You go in, they make their incision, sew you up and you go home.  You're sore for a few days.  For a woman, you are in the hospital over night at least and it is actually a surgery.  It's a lot more expensive to get tubes tied and insurance may not pay for it.<br>  <br>  Luckily, my husband is willing to do it when we make that decision.<br>  <br>  I recently read a friend's blog where her hubby got a vasectomy.  They didn't get a vein to stop bleeding inside when they sewed him up, and it continued to bleed.  He had tons of swelling and bruising and pain.  Just do some research on how often things like that happen.<br>  <br>  If you see a good urologist that has done tons of vasectomies, I would think your chances would be good of something not happening.  They aren't going to cut off too much.  It's a standard procedure and doctors aren't going to screw up and risk getting sued.|`|LYeMqJIRaa	If he feels coerced into it he may harbor resentment towards you.  I did it willingly because it was easier and safer than the tubal litigation (so I thought) and the outcome was pretty bad for me, months of pain, loss of pleasurable sensation and additional surgery.  I am thankful that my wife didn't try to force me into it because with my outcome I am uncertain if our marriage would survive intact.  Are condoms or other non surgical methods not an option ?  I would never ask my wife to have her tubes tied even if the risk were 1 in a million there could be complications.. I love her too much to put her through even a fraction of what I am going through.<br>  <br>  as for risks check here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.revolutionhealth.com/forums/mens-health/bedroom/102817?page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.revolutionhealth.com/forums/m...</a>|`|bc9inzicaa	Once you find out, please share!  <br>  <br>  I have been talking to my husband about the same topic and thus far he is firmly against it.

He thinks I am awful to think like that, but I'm being realistic.<br>  <br>  I don't think I'd ever have more children even with someone else, as I am so horrendously ill throughout pregnancy, but the procedure for women, as you say, is more complicated, so I won't be doing that either.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's unsure about wanting more children now? We were sure we wanted 2, but ended up wanting another and have 3 now.
j5rHgDSkaa	Sweetheart I am so sorry to hear that you are going through this. I know you may not think so now, but when you are older you will realize that this baby is the best thing that ever happened to you. Hundreds if people suffer from not being able to have kids of their own, and here you are at 13 being blessed with a baby. Please do not get an abortion, just remember your mom chose to have you, and if she had not, you would not have the oppritunity to bring another beautiful life into this world. Please contact me, I would love to help you get through this, and pray for you:)|`|DD9YTs5naa	1. You should'nt listen to anyone who tells you it's impossible for you to be a good mum at 13, none of the people on here know you well enough to make that judgement. Only YOU can decide if you are responsible enough to raise a child at 13<br>  <br>  2. Don't listen to the people who tell you to DEFFINATELY get an abortion. Make sure you research abortion and talk it through with a trusted adult and a good doctor. you need to make your own mind up on this decision with the help of a trusted adult.<br>  <br>  3. concider your options, for example adoption. or maybe a family member would be willing to raise the child.<br>  <br>  so my advice would be to DEFFINATELY tell your mom even though it will be hard, perhaps you could write it down for her.<br>  <br>  follow your heart AND your head, weather you continue with the pregnancy or get an abortion this is a BIG decision.<br>  <br>  and know this, you are not the first 13 year old to get pregnant. so there are others that ave been through what you are going through. don't feel alone, and make sure you ask for help.

I had my daughter's heartbeat recorded at 20 weeks and it was around 150. It sounds perfectly healthy :)|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I think it is high. My OB said normal fetal heart rate is between 120 and 160. When we first heard my daughters heart beat it was 164 and since it was early in the pregnancy my OB was not concerned. Her heart beat is now usually in the 150's.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	My daughters heart beat has been around 150, every time they've checked it and they said that's very normal. I'm not completely sure about 170, but I'm sure if it was a cause of concern your doctor would have told you.<br>  <br>  Also, if you go off of what they say, it sounds like your having a little girl, because they say girls heart rates are faster then boys.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats on the little one. =]|`|CkecSp4Uaa	No, that's pretty normal.  I'm due in the beginning of Sept. and we heard the baby's heart beat for the first time at our last visit (about 11 weeks gestation) it was 165-170 and we were told that's normal and healthy for that age.  It is pretty high compared to an adult's healthy heart rate, but keep in mind that infants and children have a faster heartbeat than adults do.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	My baby is due 09/20/2009 and i got an ultrasound on the 13th and my babies heart rate was 175bpm nurse said thats good just think of a little mouse and how fast its heart rate is because its so tiny dont worry and good luck!!

I know this is expensive, especially when you have so many baby things to buy but this is my first pregnancy and where I am in Scotland we only get 1 scan at 15 wks so I was dying to see my baby again.

That's just wrong.<br>  <br>  If I was 13 and at my friends house, and his/her mom was threatening to spank their little siblings, I'd assume it was just for the younger ones and that the 13 year old didn't get it anymore.<br>  <br>  Honestly, that's just weird. Talk to your parents about getting some other form of punishment like getting your cell phone or tv privilages taken away. Once you hit your teen (or even preteen) years spanking just becomes weird.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Yeah that's pretty embarrassing, I would tell her to say it quieter or something.  My mom doesn't say anything to me as a warning because I never get in trouble by her.|`|vfXOWjXxaa	just because she says that doesn't  necessarily mean they know you get spanked, they might just think your mom only spanks the little ones. my dad say, and i quote "i'm gonna knock the hell out of you". so yeah|`|0TEvBSQyaa	It is just a threat she wouldn't actually do it, she it just threatning you not to do it again otherwise she would embarrise but that makes you stop when she threatens you. I just get yelled at and if it that bad i get occasionally slapped on the arm or face!

So hard that you are craving childbirth! But please please be patient. They can GUESS how far along you are, but there really is no way to know, so 6 days overdue is a guess too. You see? The baby comes out when it is ready, so making it come out seems counterproductive. Once again, I truly know how uncomfortable you are, that is hard, and you've done a great job by waiting this long and using a midwife. Good for you! Plus, the baby could be born three hours from now. My second was three hours from the moment I noticed labor till the second he was born.|`|QAdBQpXraa	honestly, it varies from one woman to the next. for my sister in law it took one sweep, she had mild contractions regularly for a day and a hlf before going into established labour, for me, i had two over the space of a week, one on due date, the other 4 days later and had to be induced at 14 days past due date. <br>  <br>  my thoughts given that you've had a show already is that you'll get a better result and labour won't be far along, maybe at most a couple of days, since you've already got one foot on the ladder so to speak. <br>  <br>  best of luck, i hope it works for you.xx|`|Ev9Rnm0Xaa	hey hunny,im 41weeks and had a sweep done few days ago,normally if something is going to happen then it will within 48hours but remember a sweep has a 50percent chance of working (my midwife told me this) so you could be one of the lucky ones.unfortunately i wasnt,and my cervix was low soft and 2cms dilated so just goes to show it  prob only really works if body is about to go in to labour anyway which im guessing mine wasnt lol.its not too bad if you havent had one before it is a little uncomfortable and you can have spot bleeding afterwards but i personally found it ok xx|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	you could start labour straight after but it often takes hours .I had it done and nothing happened ,I had to be induced the next day ..good luck..

oYmZUO8Caa	I don't think Mariah Carey ruined the name. <br>  <br>  I guess it's just a less popular name as the "trendier" names like Emma, Olivia, Aubrey, etc emerge. <br>  <br>  Sometimes names have "shelf lives" ... like Tiffany. It was popular when I was born, but not as much now.|`|6YnwXCIaaa	Mariah Carey ruined the name.  There weren't many Mariahs before her, and now the name is inextricably associated with her.

a8tCObqraa	i know its aw-full and rubbish especially robert patterson lol! :P they must be mad or on drugs!|`|N5AE9O97aa	They are awful books, and the movie was downright horrible. I laughed the whole was through.<br>  <br>  Stephenie Meyer is NOT a talented author at all, and the plot is so predictable. The majority of the characters are Two dimensional and rather boring/annoying. Plus the fact all the vampires are  *perfect* aggravates me. Im a fan of perfectly imperfect characters. <br>  <br>  Overall, I think that they're well liked because, to quote,  <br>  <br>  "People are attracted by the stories, by the pace and in the case of Stephenie Meyer, it's very clear that she's writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books. It's exciting and it's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because it's not overtly sexual."<br>  <br>  He further explains, "A lot of the physical side of it is conveyed in things like the vampire will touch her forearm or run a hand over skin, and she just flushes all hot and cold. And for girls, that's a shorthand for all the feelings that they're not ready to deal with yet."<br>  <br>  Stephen King.|`|uzUCrcbSaa	hey everyone is entitled to their own opinion and if you haven't read it don't diss it because you cant have an opinion on something you've never understood.

But if your gonna respond to this question saying "i dunno, i hate them, never read it, never saw it, i hate it!" don't bother answering because your judging a book by its cover.|`|FNTeLbIuaa	girls like it because edward and bella fall in love and its like perfect. When girls read it they think "hey if bella can find her edward so can i". i really like the story but that's a main part of why i like it.  alot of guys cheat on girls and are really perverted and rude and just plain jerks but the books make girls hopeful that maybe they'll find a guy that will love them and treat the the way edward does bella:)|`|fKH7fVHPaa	if you read it you'll understand, its really good but if you dont like romantic story's and vampires and ware wolves dont bother reading or watching it, its not every ones cup of tea but most people do enjoy it plus alot of people think robert Patterson is "fit".|`|pxi1IX29aa	it's a horribly written but it's long, so prepubescent girls feel "deep" because they "looove reading liek soo much lol<33;" without putting any effort into learning new vocabulary or figuring out difficult plot twists. it has just enough sci-fi to make them feel smart, but it's overpowered by bella's long narratives describing edward cullen which are basically soft porn.|`|NXy8SnVJaa	if you ask me, it is over rated.<br>  i saw the movie.  it was good.  but, not AWESOME!<br>  and, it is a lot of bull.<br>  idk.  some of the stuff is good but everyone is way too obsessed if you ask me.|`|Cxa9T27waa	Because it's a romance story that's pretty powerful.

PwhrTNZraa	It is a strange thing.  I miscarried my second pregnancy last March at around 7weeks, and never saw it coming.  I felt pretty much the same as when I was pregnant with my daughter so when I just started spotting out of the blue, I found it strange.  I think I pretty much knew right away though....something just didn't feel "right" from the start.  My body and symptoms felt normal but you know how you just have "that feeling" that something's not quite right?  So I wasn't really surprised I had one, very disappointed though.  I spotted for 2 days then had the actual miscarriage a few days later.  On ultrasound the baby measured about 5 weeks.  <br>  <br>  I'm now pregnant again, 18weeks today, and I knew as soon as I got pregnant everything was going to be fine.  Again I had "that feeling" and everything is great.  I hope it's something you never have to experience, but if you do, just remember it's nothing you did or didn't do.  It's usually because of a chromosomal defect, the baby isn't developing properly and your body rejects it.  Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|YLXpwqceaa	I had a miscarriage last september.  I was 8 weeks pregnant, and I found out actually when my daughter was 6 weeks old.  No one ever told me that you are very fertile after delivery and to wait 6 weeks. So I got pregnant and I had a horrible feeling that I would miscarry the whole time.  I knew my body wasn't ready, and a few days before I miscarried I started cramping and I just knew it was coming. I woke up one morning and I was bleeding badly.  It was devastating.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	I miscarred at 17 weeks gestation. I had severe sickness and diarrhoea at around 13 weeks not sure if it affected the baby. I had whats called a "missed abortion" where the baby dies in your womb but you don't miscarry.  I stopped having morning sickness and I obviously didn't get any bigger but my GP told me to "rest" in bed which I did for 3 weeks. <br>  <br>  The doctor finally sent me for a scan. I ended up having a D&C and then had a nasty infection which needed 10 days antibiotics because the dead foetus had been in me for 4 weeks nearly. <br>  <br>  Many years ago now and I went on to have 2 healthy pregnancies.  Early miscarriages are quite common, luckily later ones are rarer. <br>  <br>  Try not to worry, what will be will be.
6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	She could on next visit to consultant tell them of all the travelling and ask their advise possible to be moved nearer under the circumstances.<br>  They must be aware of the distance from her address I would speak to them myself and ask if it is a risk to put your minds at rest.<br>  I hope everything goes ok for you all
sAhAEC2qaa	just say you are busy then get off the phone as fast as possible. <br>  do not listen to do your own thinking. thats a troll who is only 17. she doesn't kno wat shes talking about|`|AA11881470	That could be tough. I think you should talk to your husband about it. Tell him you don't mind helping out once in a while, but you don't want it to be a regular thing. Ask him to talk to her. He will have to find a way to do it gently so it doesn't hurt anyone's feelings. Maybe tell her you both love the kids, but you need a break. Explain to her that you are tired. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you are resenting her babysitting requests and I don't blame you. If that doesn't work, just don't answer the phone once in a while. And remember, it is ok to say no. <br>  Good Luck!|`|EmjEwfQRaa	Of course you can say no to her without feeling guilty.. I would say that your grandchildren are fortunate and blessed to have grandparents such as yourself in their life, and your daughter in law should be more appreciative of everything that you do for her. My parents are hardly ever involved with my children, and I say good for you for being there as much as you already are. Meantime, politely tell her that you very much enjoy spending time with your grandbabies..but..it should not be assumed that you are always available (or in the mood) to be a spur of the moment baby sitter. Good luck|`|mAsQbiIgaa	Of course-you just say no we're busy or too tired etc.<br>  <br>  If I thought someone was minding my little one and didn't really want to be spending time with her, I'd not be happy.  And FYI if she;s left crafts if probably so the kids will have something to focus on rather than you having to run round after them.<br>  <br>  And to be fair you can't just expect to be able to do what you want with them, they are little kids.  My little one is 9 months and anyone who babysits minds her at my house where she is in her own environment and has her own toys and is much less hassle for me.  No one who helps me out mind at all.<br>  <br>  Perhaps tell her you are going to be having a few busy weeks at work and you're only free on a certain day to mind the kids.   <br>  <br>  How often is she asking you to mind them at present?<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  <br>  We'll you should make a point of leaving when their dad comes home.|`|4beOKtogaa	You always have the option of saying "I'm sorry, that just won't work for us today."<br>  You don't need to offer any other explanation or feel any guilt.|`|axqzB6iWaa	My mother was stuck in the same predicament. She would always have to babysit, and she would always tell me how she feels like she doesn't have a life anymore. So I told her that she needed to confront my sister and let her know that she was not going to babysit more than once or twice a week, and on certain days only. No late Friday or Saturday nights so my sister can go partying. <br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty because ultimately the children are her responsibility, not yours. You are done more than what your are supposed to. The children are very lucky to have you in their lives.|`|j5aRAJxPaa	Who says you can't say anything to your step daughter? I can't understand how combined family's that can't openly Communicate can function.  Can't her father say something?<br>  Only YOU are in charge of how you let others make you feel. Stop feeling guilty and say something to this lady. Unless you like feeling like a maid when you go over?<br>  I'm blessed beyond words that my MIL wants my son, it helps out so much. However in my case, she wants him all time and I have to say no! LOL!<br>  Good luck.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	My mom has the same problem with it.  You just need to be straight forward with them tell them how much you love the kids, but sometimes you just need to relax after work.  Also, if you aren't completely against telling them that you won't watch say that you will watch them, but need more notice and say which days are better and so on.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Then you just say no, we have other plans, but we'd love to see them next week. <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Plan once or twice a month for babysitting and let them know that you'll be available on those times and that one of those times will be at your house and one will be at theirs.
aohKqXraaa	YES it does, and Yes you can!|`|AA11490385	Yes it contains sperm and you could become pregnant from it.  That is part of the reason why the "pull out" method fails for some, in part because even if the man does not ejaculate into you, the pre-ejaculate can possibly get you pregnant.|`|dTPg4uYzaa	yes you can stil get pregnant from pre ejacualtion its does contain sperm|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes it does and yes you can get pregnant from it<br>  <br>  i have and am...<br>  <br>  married and expecting baby #1|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, it is semen and contains sperm.  Ejaculation is not actually necessary.  It just gives the little sperms a head start.
ThnKiLfTaa	The portrayed perfect family like the "Brady Bunch" or "The Partridge Family" doesn't exist in reality! No family is perfect! Every family has their ups and downs and their good day and bad days! But just be happy with the family God has blessed you with and do your best to raise healthy well rounded kids! And don't sweat the small stuff. I am not going to put on a "show" for anyone. I don't live a lie, and make others believe me, my family and my house are perfect and then behind closed doors it's a whole other story. NOT ME! I am who I am and I don't feel I should pretend to be anyone else! I love my life as a Mommy and Wife! I love my kids, my husband and my house and believe me we are NOT the "perfect" family!|`|sbeoF50gaa	My brother has "perfect kids" with a "perfect life" but... their kids are well behave because their mom is, in MY OPINION, mean to the kids. She spanks them and yanks their arms and  yells at them, and to me it's like she's instilling fear into them so yea... her kids are well behaved. I disagree with most of their parenting, and they fight a lot as a couple. But They appear to have the perfect life to people who aren't related to them lol<br>  <br>  on another note haven't you seen those shows about "the perfect family" but the wife goes missing and the husband killed her or these kids are TV saying "yea we looked like the perfect family and no one knew we were  being molested" etc etc... there's skeletons in everyones closet. My family isn't perfect... I could pick a million things wrong with my husband, but of course my kid is perfect lol aside from her being spoiled rotten|`|0YDtjp3Baa	OMG, 2 of my friends are "perfect" and i can't stand it. they never get in trouble for anything and they just think they are better than everyone.<br>  <br>  what about this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuA.EnU5IUv5hpvfa6ePp8nty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222110128AAsW2iL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	no, but i know a few who THINK their  kids are perfect, and usually you cant even stand to be around those  ones because they have never been disciplined or taught right from wrong, since according to their parents, everything they do is "right"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  glenna,  i love the lil puppy  hes SO cute!  lol|`|NuvKPl3naa	i have to say i envy my sister in law. their house is immaculate and everything is really nice. she works out of her home and her 3 kids are all adorable. they are always on the go and enjoying life. i cant say her kids are perfect but pretty darn close. i have asked her about the secret but she wont give it up|`|cY8DgJv5aa	No, I don't know anyone like that.  I know some women who seem to really have a great family life, but then I go to their house and its completely trashed.  Looks like they haven't cleaned in years.  I know some other women who have an immaculate house, yet their kids are holy terrors.  lol  I've never met anyone who appears to have everything 'perfect' though.  I feel like I'm a happy medium.  My kids are great kids most of the time and my house is generally well-kept.  My little world of controlled chaos is the closest I will ever get to perfection.  I'm far from perfect though.<br>  <br>  *Thanks Arial.  That's Sadie.  A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  I need to update the picture, but just haven't done it yet.|`|JivuAmfiaa	Oh yes, my next-door neighbour is the "perfect" mum with "perfect" kids.

Honestly, compared to them my kids look like complete monsters. <br>  The alien theory is a good one, and it kinda explains why they're so perfect.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	oh yes my little sister she has 2 kids ages 4 and 5. her kids walk on egg shells never do any thing bad. her house is always clean dinner always made. every thing is perfect to with her. it is so annoying how can she be so perfect?|`|C4miEeuYaa	No family is ever perfectly happy..It might come off that way-but there's always something..To answer your question-no, I don't know anyone like that.

If you are TTC you should be in a loving relationship with ONE man, stop sleeping around!!! think of all these ladies that have been TTC for years.|`|sk46uigvaa	no only one sperm can penetrate an individual egg.<br>  <br>  If 2 men ejaculated in a women who was ovulating at the same time and she released 2 eggs then yes a sperm from each man could fertilise the separate eggs and create 'twins' But not heard of it happening before, if it happened to me i would be very ashamed!!.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	There's something wrong with you.  Get away.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Once one sperm enters an egg, that's it.  No other sperm can get in.  It is impossible for two different sperm to fertilize one egg.  <br>  <br>  Identical twins come from one fertilized egg (fertilized by only one sperm) splitting into two embryos.  It has nothing to do with how many sperm are present.  However, it is a minute possibility that if a woman releases two eggs (known as fraternal twins as they grows), then one of each man's sperm could fertilize each egg.  Then the baby's would essentially be fraternal twins, but by different fathers.  I honestly can't think of one single example of that happening though.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Only one sperm ever enters an egg. Twins happen if a) 2 eggs are fertilized at the same time - non identical twins or b) one egg splits into two and each "half" grows producing identical twins. <br>  <br>  The situation you describe could happen if the woman produced 2 eggs and different sperm fertilized them on the same day, not necessarily at the same instant but within a few hours.  Technically it could happen.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	it is very rare but it has happened, but they cant fertilise the same egg, they could fertilise two eggs it your body produces them but two sperm cant go into the same egg, this isnt how twins are made|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Yes it can happen.  It has been known for women who have slept with two men at one time to have twins that have different fathers.  <br>  <br>  However it is more common in cats, strangely enough lol|`|PwhrTNZraa	Twins is the division of cells, only one sperm can fertilize one egg.  If you released two eggs, it's possible one of each sperm could fertilize each egg but I'm sure the chances of THAT happening are way lower than you ever winning the lottery.|`|vpKhZvYraa	That sounds extremely unlikely as the sperm would have to travel at the exact same speed and ejaculate inside her at the exact same time. Not sure the female biology is set up to have two penises inside it and if the male biology is set up for synchronised orgasms|`|PElSsv7Maa	could be as once in a babystory it showed how two man couple both donated sperm to the surrogate mother and had twins ...each one fertilised with one man sperm!|`|txSiQc7Waa	Eggs are one spermie kinda things ;) Double fertilization is not gonna happen.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	no that cant happen|`|hIzQyflqaa	are you talking about yourself? yuk! if not the answer is no anyway!
nrqWwQBXaa	why dont you just ask your mom what is happining?|`|sbeoF50gaa	I think maybe you should ask your mom if she's aware of the noises she's making.

9OsjdsrZaa	A lot of what he is doing is just age related.  If you step back and think about it...he relies on you for everything; food, drink, love, toys, transportation, you name it.  Crying and whining may be the only way he knows how to get your attention. That is not to say we have to like it.  It is a sanity stealer and can drive you bonkers.  Here are some tips that work great for me.  I found them on Babycenter.com a while back, and I have never gone back to my old method of yelling...because they actually work.<br>  <br>  Define it.<br>  We often assume that our kids know what whining is and realize how awful it sounds — but that's not necessarily the case. Label whining when you hear it and ask your child to use her regular voice instead. If she has trouble hearing the difference, demonstrate it for her. Explain that whining sounds yucky and makes people stop listening. Practice "good" and "not so good" voices together — hearing you at your whiniest will probably elicit a good laugh from your child.  This still works with my 5 year old.<br>  <br>  Acknowledge your child's need for attention.<br>  Two-year-olds often resort to whining when they've tried and failed to get their parent's ear.  Bend down to his level and make eye contact with him.  Once he sees that your listening, you can get him to tell you what he wants without whining.<br>  <br>  Show her a better way to address the problem.<br>  If your child can't get past the whining, try restating the issue for him. For instance, say, "I can see that you're upset. Is it because I can't take you to the park right now?" This will help you get a conversation going. Be sure to carve out regular time to read a story together, do a puzzle, or just have fun — without your child having to complain first. Touch him affectionately, give him plenty of hugs, and praise him when he behaves the way you want. When he sees that other methods of voicing his needs produce results — and that whining doesn't — the whines will taper off.<br>  <br>  Avoid triggers.<br>  taking a hungry child grocery shopping before dinner and expecting him to understand that cookies will spoil his appetite is like putting a new trampoline in the kitchen and expecting him not to jump on it until the soufflé is done: It's a foolproof recipe for disaster. Feed him before you go, or pack some healthy snacks he can eat on the way or in the store. Likewise, life will be easier for both of you if you can avoid dragging him on errands — or even to the zoo, for that matter — when he's due for a nap.<br>  <br>  What's difficult for parents is that 2-year-olds have so few communication skills. So just about anything — not enough toys on the floor, too many kids in a room, or too much juice in the cup — can trigger whining. Your best bet is to be ready to step in with a redirect ("It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Super Mama") before the whining starts, and practice a few consistent responses you'll use once you hear it.<br>  <br>  Be — or at least pretend to be — nonchalant when the whining goes into overdrive. (This is the one I struggle most with)<br>  The last thing you want your child to decide is that whining in public is a good way to get what he wants, so stick to your principles. No matter where you are, whom you're with, or what kind of tone your child uses, keep your cool. Don't blow up or give in ("Oh, go ahead, do whatever you want!"). Even if it gets you immediate relief from that annoying whine, you'll pay in the long run by hearing more and more of it.<br>  <br>  Being a parent is one of the hardest things to do...With 3 and 1 on the way...I am constantly dealing with the whines.  But I tell you.  If you are consistent with these steps they work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eZDoQPg8aa	It's easy, whining or crying works.  He gets whatever he wants just so you don't have to listen to it.<br>  <br>  Tell him if he wants something to ask for it in a normal voice such as "May I have a drink, please?"  If he whines, tell him to ask again.  Don't give in until he gets it right.  <br>  <br>  You will have to pack your resolve on this one, whining has always worked and now all of a sudden it doesn't so he is going to ramp it up big time.  Remain calm, just tell him when you can ask for it properly without whining, you may have it.<br>  <br>  And then you will have to address the times when he can't have/do something and is whining about that.  Just turn a deaf ear to it.  Send him to time out or his room.  Tell him as long as he is whining, you are not listening.  Do not let him bait you back in to the whining routine.  <br>  <br>  As long as you keep to the "plan" it will work but be prepared.  It also means that you as the parent are really taking control of the situation and he's not going to like it one little bit.  His whining is also a way of controlling your behavior.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Stop responding to the whining and make him point to what ever it is he wants. When he points to something , you say "Car?" and he doesn't get it until he at least makes an attempt to say "car". In a few days you should be able to remind him "to use his words" because you don't understand what uh uh uh means. When he even tries to form the word, reinforce the behavior by saying "here is the car" he will get it pretty quickly if the whining doesn't work anymore.|`|145RUNQHaa	You've had a couple of total NUTTERS answer this question.best advice i can give you is realise he won't be moaning for nothing there is ALWAYS a reason but it just might not seem like a reason to you.he's thirsty,hungry,bored,lonely,tired,needs some fresh air,needs a hug it's got to be something like that.try distracting him if he's moaning let him do a colouring in ,take him for a walk ,sit with him read a book,get down on the floor with him play with his cars together or whatever he's got,treat him to an ice cream,go and feed the ducks anything like that he sounds fed up to me.|`|AA11476951	Here is your answer... Ignore it! When he keeps at it and gets right in your face say "oh did you need something? Talk to mommy like a big boy and I'll get it for you." Never give him what he wants when he whines for it! It will take a little while but he'll start to leave the whining out and just start asking instead.|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	oooi wish i could help u there.....i have been having the same problem with my 2 year old son....so when u find out let me know|`|yUyx2nhmaa	well something must be the matter with him.|`|rJgrwIodaa	Stop paying attention to him.  Crying is a learned behavior, children cry to see what kind of reaction they get.  If it gets them what they want, they cry.  He's probably been getting his way for a while, so he knows this works.  Also he's entering the terrible twos.  Learn how to discipline him now or it will just get worse as he gets older.  Children should not get everything they want.  Have him earn his priviliges, and make sure he shows some semblance of understanding.  This will teach him not to cry to get something he wants - that the only way he'll get it is by doing what you ask.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Welcome to the terrible two's.  It won't stop anytime soon, I can tell you that.  All you can do is encourage him to speak like a big boy and stop the whining.  For as long as he whines for something, he doesn't get it. Period.  If you give him what he wants, then it just reinforces the behavior.  When he's whining, just tell him that you can't understand him and that if he wants to talk to you, he needs to use his big boy voice (or baby sign language, or point or whatever technique works best for you).  Then ignore him until he does what he's told.  Obviously, don't ignore him if something really is wrong, but do ignore just general whining.  When he talks the right way or asks for something without whining, then praise him and give him exactly what he wants (within reason of course).  Eventually he'll realize that whining gets him nowhere, but being a big boy works wonders.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	From experience with my 4 year old I think that's just a stage that he or she is going through right now.  There's not much that you really CAN do that's going to make much difference because regardless what most think...punishing is only going to make it worse.  *In this case anyway.*<br>  <br>  One thing that I have developed doing with my daugther and it has worked is when she starts crying or whinning for something I simply tell her...I cannot understand you or talk to you when you are crying...go sit down, and when you stop crying come back and talk to me.  THEN, when she stops crying she gets what she wants, until then, she can go else where and cry.  Now of course this isn't going to work the first time...but its worked pretty well for me...usually when my daughter cries or whines for no reason now it doesn't even take her walking off and going to sit down before she stops crying.  At first, RIGHT NOW, Patience is the key!  :o)|`|iMaTMWMxaa	My daughter is almost 2 and the same. Has he got all his teeth through yet? The ones at the very back come through around now. That's what it is with my daughter.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't talk very well, try signing as it eases the frustration.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Tell him to use his words. Ask him if he wants a cookie if he cries say use your words Mommy  don't know what you want  Have him practice. Do this with toys. Do not give in.He may be going thru the terrible 2 stage|`|wDVWnSuIaa	My brother is 6 and he still does that. You just have to tell him who is boss, keep him occupied, and he will eventually grow out of it. He is still little.|`|RvShEWESaa	A little whiskey, about half a shot mixed with some water.<br>  <br>  DO NOT, do it too often.<br>  <br>  It sounds bad, but read what's in children's Robitussin and tell me I am evil.....|`|rwhqgTB6aa	It's not easy, but you have to be firm and consistent. Make sure you are spending enough time with him, giving him plenty of attention, and praising his positive actions. Then ignore the whining. Don't give in. Put him in a time out, not as a punishment but to separate yourself from him. If he won't stay in time out then give yourself a time out. If he's 2 years old time outs should last for 2 minutes (one minute per year of age.) Be careful about making threats that you won't follow through on or it will give him the impression that he is winning. Remember that you are the adult and don't let him bring you down. It is the toughest thing that you can do to be firm with your child, but it is the best for both of you. Good luck.|`|4VWBJpvfaa	just ignore him and leave him in a room by himself for a while.  he is just two years old.  its normal, don't worry.  or just ask him what he wants and explain he can't have it.  most toddlers are like this.  its nothing.|`|7VBdPtIQaa	It's the age. He is just frustrated. There minds are ahead of their motor skills. He knows what he wants and wishes he can tell you but it upsets him that he is unable to get it across. Just hang in there...it will pass.|`|yN9ei6fqaa	slap him around a lil bit. tell him to be a man

fHjSonssaa	Clear mucous could be rather normal- the brownish could be normal if you recently had a pelvic exam.<br>  <br>  The woman you were referring to didn't "pee" her water- her water was leaking for 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  The same thing happened to me- My water was slow leaking at 32 weeks and the test came back negative.  That, however, would be a watery clear fluid- not a thick mucous.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you are losing party of your plug- it can fall out a bit and regenerate itself.<br>  <br>  Just go to your DR on Monday- the brown color seems a bit odd.|`|1qnbvUYPaa	Welcome to pregnancy! The peeing only gets worse as your progress, its from the baby weighing down your bladder.<br>  <br>  You also get discharge through out pregnancy. Don't worry, you and your baby are fine.

It could also be a bladder infection.|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	Dude that's perfectly normal cervical fluid. But that's a lot, so just take it easy like the doctor said.|`|IyWnHqPuaa	It sounds like vaginal discharge to me, one of the reasons you may be peeing alot is the way your baby is laying, if its laying on your bladder you will pee alot. Dont stress just take it easy and vist your doc on monday.|`|dTPg4uYzaa	its normal to pee alot and have some discharge during pregancy the baby grows and starts to put pressure on your organs mostly your bladder but if your reallythat conserned about it talk to your doctor on your next visit|`|SLbrSRkGaa	it sounds normal - as long as you aren't having contractions - I would listen to the dr and rest - don't do any heavy lifting or any lifting at all - take it easy feet up! Don't worry!|`|UQF9u06Yaa	Im not sure...just hang in there...ask the doctor...just keep cool and do the right things untill your water breaks...|`|QSodlfMraa	be happy you do not have her doctor, but do as you doctor say until monday.

In fact, baby not moving inside is dangerous and worrisome... Call your doctor for more info...|`|DD9YTs5naa	pretty sure it's just hiccups which is very common in your stage of pregnancy because she's practicing swallowing.|`|TmOQlvtHaa	Your pregnant! That's good! Your going to become a mother later on! <3 No worries. Maybe its.. uhh.. Okay.. I'm not the pregnant expert here... but maybe its a good thing! :D|`|QSodlfMraa	maybe she has the hiccups|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Completely normal. Your baby is getting big and there isn't a lot of room in there. Also the baby is getting ready to be born so it needs to switch positions (head down). Nothing to fear.|`|AA11085356	I doubt anything is wrong. If she's moving, that's usually a good sign! I would be worried if you couldn't feel her! My son used to do that before he was born, I actually kind of miss it now! Don't be afraid to ask your doctor about it if you are bothered by it, though.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	She has the hiccups which is completely normal you would get them also if you were swimming around in water for so long.|`|BQXg09m9aa	It could be because she has the hiccups! I've heard o babies doing stuff like that!<br>  <br>  Or, she may just be.....dancing?She/He'll probably have a great sense of humor! lol|`|UinOWcMUaa	go to the doctors -- silly :)|`|ryGHtoddaa	The first thing i thought when i read your question was that you were thinking of aborting the baby..<br>  Because you said that you were pregnant and scared.<br>  But it is totally normal for a baby to move that's a good she is  telling you that she is healthy and full of life.<br>  <br>  If she is jumping all the time maybe she has hiccups.<br>  Try drinking water and gently clap your stomach with your hands so the hiccups could go away..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS FOR THE NEW BABY|`|U8oR3VU6aa	It is normal. And it is a good sign. What would be bad is if she stopped moving, like for a day or two. The closer it gets to your delivery date the more movement you should feel. You can even watch your stomach move.|`|IlXW1s3xaa	Dont be worried you just have a hyper baby!! lol No if your baby wasn't moving at all then you should be worried|`|rdpZrBc9aa	She has a good sense of rhythm!<br>  <br>  Nothing is wrong with her.  You're both fine.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	Your baby has the hiccups in there. Could drive a lady crazy, I know.|`|eytlIKITaa	Are you sure she doesn't have the hiccups?|`|aohKqXraaa	Could be hiccups.  I'm 37 wks and my daughter does the same to me.. doctor says it it likely hiccups.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	sounds like hiccups to me xx|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	At this point in your pregnancy you should be going to the dr every other week or every week...so my first piece of advice would be if this has been going on for the past couple weeks...ask your dr about it.  If you are truly concerned don't hold that in...that's what your dr is there for.  <br>  <br>  As far as my personal opinion, I don't think there's anything to be worried about.  Just as children when they are born have their most active times of the day, so do children in the womb.  Or, as others have mentioned, she could have the hiccups.  Trust me...its better to feel her moving ALOT than not too.  But, just ask your dr.!|`|1U7yLEf9aa	It's hickups!! I know it freaked me out too. I'm 34 weeks with my son and he does this ALL the time. I'm a high risk pregnancy and while I was on the monitor (3 different times lol) he was doing this and it was loud!!! They said its hickups. The baby is practicing swollowing and stuff now so they get hickups. It's fine. Don't worry. Good luck and Congratulations!!!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	She probably has the hiccups when i was pregnant with my son he would do that sometimes even for an hour i would be like what the heck but the doctor did an ultrasound and he is fine...the doc said it was probably just the hiccups...and when he was born it was funny cuz he had the hiccups all the time i felt so bad because he hated them!|`|ZHGMLPhuaa	Don't worry she's probally just hungry, scared, crying like a baby       ( you know how babys cry alot ) well don't worry cause the more stressed you are the more stressed your babie's going to be!!!!

It's if you don't feel her move for a long time, then you should have concern.|`|rUk58ywKaa	hiccups  Don't worry about it.|`|2HYMjp63aa	i dont know the answer as i am not and have not been pregnant. good luck though !|`|pxTsBlOMaa	Go to your doctor.|`|LzWfHMZhaa	yuh outta luck.|`|uxmqgmCCaa	aw so cute its the hiccups dont worry|`|yN9ei6fqaa	ask a doc
Jswomud7aa	Birth control, such as Yaz, is 99% effective as long as you take it at the same time every day with out missing any days.<br>  <br>  If you don't follow the exact instructions that are located in the pamphlet that comes with you BC, then the effectiveness does decrease.<br>  <br>  It is important that you take Yaz at the same time every day because the dose of hormones it contains to prevent pregnancy are really low.<br>  <br>  Chances are that you will be fine. I am also on Yaz and I'm not the most consistent person on taking it at the same time every day either, but I haven't gotten pregnant yet and my hubby "finishes" every time inside.<br>  <br>  Because human health isn't an exact science there is no way to predict 100% if you will or will not get pregnant, but chances are you will be fine. BC is really dependable.|`|4VIjILk1aa	Birth Control is not always effective. I don't think you have any thing to worry about in tell you start showing signs of pregnancy. If you are really worried then wait 2 weeks and take a test.|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	the BC should work ,so long as you take it right it is affective ,otherwise why bother taking it ...the main reason to keep using a condom is to protect from disease ...also just as back up ..|`|zVFPuAFTaa	I am on Yaz as well and me and my boyfriend never use a condom.  We have never had a problem with this but that's just us.  It depends on your body.|`|QeALCWbqaa	shold work
NVmDVBPyaa	Im 37 1/2 weeks too!  <br>  It means you are getting there.  It doesn't mean labor is imminent.  You could go without your mucous plug for a couple of weeks.  However if you are still having the cramps and backache --those are great labor signs!!!!!|`|BMZTyrjjaa	you could be at the beginning stages of labor. This stage could last a day or a week. i would call your doctor and they will tell you what to do next.|`|a5b42e198900103c6593fc522b1a9354aa	With my first pregnancy I lost my mucus plug about a week before my daughter was born.<br>  <br>  I'm 37 weeks now with my second pregnancy and I could have sworn I lost mine this morning, it's so hard to tell at this point !!<br>  <br>  It means it is close, but you could still have a week or so to go.<br>  <br>  Call you doctor if you are concerned though.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	Yes it means you are dilating. It also means you should not go swimming or do anything that could cause bacteria to get to your "water sack" bacause there is nothing there to protect it now.  You should be right on time. Those are exactly my dilations and mucus plug loss times that I had with my daughter.  Good luck!!!! Congratulations!!!
B9KwqnuDaa	Try a nursing necklace. Basically it's a long necklace with colourful chunky beads on it that baby can play with while nursing. You can buy them, but it's cheaper to make your own.|`|bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	I'm having the exact same problem with my 5 month old. I have resorted to tying my hair up, not looking at her, patting her on the bum and feeding whilst walking. Rather difficult but I find she gets drowsy  after a while then I can sit down and continue as she couldn't be bothered to look around anymore. This doesn't always work and it does mess up the feeding routine when I cant get her to feed for long. Looking forward to seeing what advice you get as it may help me too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

21Lnhdfeaa	at least three weeks.|`|90zcKChJaa	until the day of your missed period.

Test then.|`|tLXY9QsAaa	At least 3-4 weeks.|`|VS8mactUaa	3 weeks from the day you had sex, and up to 5 days bfore your period is due, but your chances for an accurate result are much higher the closer you get to your period.
eACZ1Rhjaa	If you are hired before you get pregnant they will just put you on light duty until the birth. I would wait until after training and on the force before starting a family. Being a single mother is different from being married so make sure you understand the differences. You will want to get a child support order even if you are living like a family and decide who gets to claim the child on taxes. You might want to see an accountant to help you with decisions on things like that.|`|QSodlfMraa	look at the rules at work.|`|6L9jJnchaa	You planned it out, but you're not married.<br>  <br>  That sounds really irresponsible to me.  Why don't you plan a little better and actually commit to each other before you commit to an infant?|`|2osuEr0naa	You can not LEGALLY loose your job. Talk to your work about it. They can't fire you. Your fine. :] <br>  <br>  I got a job when I was 4 months along, and I'm now 6 months and I just told my job, and they're excited for me! <br>  <br>  You have nothing to worry about! If you're ready, start a family. <br>  Hope everything works out for you! Good luck!|`|rjVALevtaa	It's illegal to fire someone based on their pregnancy. This is true in all 50 states.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	it's illegal for a job to fire you if you get pregnant.|`|AA11865529	What's the rush? If you are concerned about losing your job, wait until you've been a police officer for awhile. You will then have more say in what shift because that will matter a lot in caring for your child. And you will have time in the job and see if you can balance working as a cop (with the risks involved) and children, just by how rough it is just doing it without a kid.<br>  <br>  Also, wait until you are married. If you can't make that commitment to each other, then you aren't ready to co-parent. (I know you are engaged, but that isn't married.) Even though you are living together, in the back of your mind is the idea that if it gets rough, you can walk away. Not so easy with marriage. Then you realize you have to put up with all the little things that seem cute now, but annoying later. I wouldn't consider having a baby until you have been married a year and worked out all the issues.<br>  <br>  As long as you aren't certain, wait. You are very young and have lots of time.<br>  <br>  Although it may be against the law to fire someone for being pregnant (and that is not universally true), they can always make up a reason to fire you. Very hard to prove that it was due to pregnancy.|`|90zcKChJaa	You should do what you want to do in life. I am in somewhat of the same boat.

But the end results are worth it.  I'm just telling you this because it's HARD work to be married, especially at first.  And it's HARD work to go to school, usually.  Maybe you should wait till your married and schooling is done, most people aren't able to do all this at once and still keep peace in their lives.|`|VjPnHxZyaa	Your job can't fire you...that is called discrimination!

Each woman is different... her body will react differently to coming off of the pill... You can't really put a time limit on it. Best thing to do is don't worry about it. Don't "try" to conceive.

You have to let your hormones get back to normal. The best time would be 13-15 days after your first period you have, that would be your normal time of ovulation.|`|fxfMFT6Yaa	you can't put a time Limit on conceiving, it took me 4 months to get pregnant. it could take months or more like years to get pregnant, some people get pregnant first time round.<br>  <br>  as i said it take time (GOOD LUCK)<br>  <br>  baby dust for you :D
B9KwqnuDaa	Every baby is different. Both my babies weighed about 10 pounds and 1 month.|`|QSodlfMraa	post in the new born section.|`|AA11865529	Should be closer to 12 pounds. Below is a chart doctors use to see where a baby fits on the scale. But really, your pediatrician is the one who should be advising you, not strangers.

bbtosxyJaa	legal: yes.<br>   lazy: yes<br>  <br>  but when i have kids i'm not going to make the oldest be the third parent. if i need them to watch them, i'll pay them for some of their time, it's not their job to watch the younger kids constantly, especially a 3 year old and a 10 month old, and i'm the oldest in my family so i know how that feels. but doesn't a 13 year old need more sleep than his mom, because he's not the one who had the kids is he?|`|1gVDZrPuaa	It's legal, but the mom is very lazy.|`|EccBqsntaa	Yeah. I babysit my god brother who is 2 1/2 and I'm 13 almost 14.|`|xbgCwmbdaa	no, it's not. 12 is the legal age, I believe.

A 13 year old boy deserves to have fun and that's sad that he is forced to spend his teen years watching his siblings constantly.|`|I64JOuMKaa	well its not illegal but I don't think you should do it because he/she's only 13 ... and well they don't really know much and things can happen.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Hey Girl!<br>  <br>  Of course it's legal. But the mother shouldn't do that everyday.  They're her children and she shouldn't push them on her 13 year old son.|`|LvThe1Hcaa	It varies from state to state, but that's the stupidest thing I ever heard.  So she can go tanning???!!!|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Illegal no. Irresponsible and lazy, yes.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:

AA10699440	hey i thought i would let you know i have been trying for 2 years after having my mirena taken out. i also had two  children without really trying and after the iud it is kinda like it shut me down or something. good luck to us both i guess!|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Mmm not that i know of. i just stopped bleeding from having mine removed. did u try an ovulation test
TMesceHIaa	I love it.<br>  <br>  My name is Eva. I hate mine, but I wouldn't change it.|`|Lg8C1Loxaa	Don't change your name, I like it. It's very unique. I have never heard of a last name being Marie... that means it's very unqiue. Please if you do change you name, talk to your parents about it.|`|W2rZ44Keaa	I actually like the name its very pretty. Mine is kind of bland. It's Nycole Rose. Middle name from my Grandma lol. I really like yours don't change it too much hassle anyway.|`|6YnwXCIaaa	It's a fairly uninspired name, but not worth the hassle of changing it.|`|4bGvM2YMaa	change it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|z4blIUneaa	i like it----i wouldnt change it!!|`|GSqn7Cu0aa	i like it i wanted my kids name someday to be similar|`|1k1E7OJqaa	why do u hate it i mean its kinda long but i like it|`|2rOQyvaKaa	You can change it like me.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	I love it!  Your name is a gift from your parents that you should be able to hold on to and cherish forever.  My name is Emily Lynn, and I would never think of changing it.|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I love it, Only I don't like the two middle name thing. I like Emily AnneMarie, and I think it's beautiful. Your parents gave you that name for a reason. I really do like it though. I wouldn't change it.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	you probably hate it because a lot of people are named emily and ann and marie are filler names. don't change it though. just have a nickname.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	I think it is very pretty and it goes together quite well. Why not find a nickname that you prefer? It is a hassle to change your name!|`|ZX2so3twaa	i don't love the two middle names thing, but i wouldn't change it.|`|Ieslv5JJaa	I actually really like it. I think its common, but becoming very uncommon with all of these new names people are coming up with. I think its a very pretty name.<br>  <br>  Mine is Melissa Julie Ann, and I would muuuch pretty prefer Emily Ann Marie!<br>  <br>  :)|`|oYmZUO8Caa	It is very simple and traditional - but I wouldn't change it. At least your name isn't something like Emelee Auhhn Mahrie or some odd spelling. It's still cute and your name will age well.|`|nYioXmnGaa	Hey it is better than my name  Gretta Rose Lynn ! I do not really like it that much but I do like it because nobody else has it !!!|`|5Ho7uxMVaa	Actually, I love Ann Marie! I want to name my little girl AnnaMArie, which is somewhat close).

But if you don't like the more "female" type names you should change it.
CFnkrvyvaa	It's less likely that you will get pregnant while having sex on your period but it's always possible. If you took the morning after pill within 72 hours of having sex, it is very unlikely that you are pregnant.|`|AA11037376	You could be yes, my friend took the morning after pill and she is pregnant so the only way to find out is too do a test.No good worrying now, worry if its possitive, Good luck.|`|j4bzgjolaa	The morning after pill can cause spotting.|`|abyGE2BGaa	What do you mean you THINK you had sex? Surely you would know! Do a pregnancy test to put your mind at rest.|`|QSodlfMraa	planned parenthood.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	You THINK you had unprotected sex??<br>  You don't THINK it went in that much??<br>  Were you drugged?!<br>  And why would you have sex while you're on your period anyways? Ew...<br>  <br>  Oh and to answer your Q i don't know, it would be impossible to get an answer on here as we are not human pregnancy tests, go out and buy a proper one...it's scary but you have to do it!<br>  <br>  Good luck =)
MHOxPs8Oaa	Why is he against the zoo? I am just curious.  That's where my nephew's first birthday party was and it was great.  Are there any little kid places around your area to play like jungle jims? I don't know if you've ever heard of that place, but they have some little kid rides there and other fun stuff for kids.  Or you can go out to a cheap place for dinner with the family on his b-day and bring a cake.  Then you and your husband can take him to do something fun the next day.  For my daughter we had it at my house and did a luau because we had a pool in our back yard.  So maybe you can go to a little kid pool area if they one by you and have it there.<br>  <br>  Is it too rude to ask if the others will pay to get in? The other families that went to my nephew's party paid for themselves because their family is tight on money.  I love the zoo idea though especially if you are doing the theme zoo animals.|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	Assuming that slippin Grammy a xanex is out of the q....i would see if there was a park that had open space the thing about th zoo is there are some kids(assuming kids your childs age form play group or what not will be there)would probaby be scared or eaten|`|bBP1Xlnkaa	I'm sorry to hear he is against the zoo, that sounds like fun. For our girls we treated the whole first birthday as a milestone for us- I guess that's because we felt we survived the first year with twins and little to no help. I'll bet there has to be a nice open park somewhere. Would explaining to your hubby that this first birthday is as much a celebration for the both of you as it is for your son? Maybe he'll soften up a bit? If not you might also be able to pay someone come out to the park and present some animals for the kids to see and touch. I know there are animal rental companies out there who like to educate- even if they are there for the kids they know they are also educating the parents and the little ones would probably like to feel the animals. Just an idea...|`|oubzJUlGaa	<3 was there swimming at the birthday luau? We have a backyard pool and I'm planning to host a bunch of little kids (and their parents) for a big birthday bash. The pool will be open, but no swimming is planned. Is this a good idea?<br>  <br>  As far as the zooparty is concerned, if hubby's issue is the cost and it's not expensive that should convince him to do the zoo thing or does he have an alternative idea?|`|jcEtRUVZaa	I suggest you save the Zoo party for when your son is older, he won't remember it. I hosted a jungle party years ago and will write it up soon, meanwhile, here's another article about planning a party:<br>  <br>  How to Plan a Child's Birthday Party<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4788328_plan-childs-birthday-party.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4788328_plan-chi...</a>
W0gMQVoDaa	yes just pour hot water over the tea bag and you might want to add a little cold water,i had raspberry leaf tea once a day from 37wks and i believe it does work to soften your cervix as i had all 3 of my children the day before their due date and straight forward delivery's,good luck and congratulations xx|`|uxmqgmCCaa	you can buy the capsules from a health shop and just take them like a tablet with water
c73QkZ2haa	If he has had it that long id be more firm with the doctor about him seeing a specialist or something. The symptoms could be a sign of an underlying problem. Its your child you have the right to ask for further care when you are concerned with something wrong with him<br>  <br>  My son(15 weeks)has had issues with his breathing since birth...wheezing, coughing, choking, gasping. My doctor agreed it wasnt normal for it to go on so long and so far hes been to 2 specialist and theyve yet to discover the problem but all agree it is one but most of the time people just think that he has a cold if they dont know the history...|`|a7pgX1W8aa	See if your doctor will prescribe a machine that dispenses albuterol to help him with his breathing or an abuterol syrup. This has always helped my children in the past. Hope this helps.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	children's olbas oil on mattress. he shouldn't be ill that long, persevere with the doctor. they say making his bed slightly raised at one end to aid clearing congestions helps too.|`|hIzQyflqaa	if your worried take him to hospital, he could be getting a chest infection.|`|tyJYhyEjaa	If u are feeling like something is wrong do something take him in every day if u have to until they figure out what is wrong.  You dont want to be mad at yourself if something does go wrong.  I heard for cough put vicks on the bottom of their feet.  Hemidifiers are woulderful.  Has he been tested for RSV maybe it is ashma and he needs some nebulizer treatments ask your dr about that.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	ask your doc for referral; needs to be figured out asap..|`|X6as2nOAaa	Get the humidifier and get the vikks baby rub I got that and it really helped my baby.
T5MjtA8Daa	it doesn't matter what position she's in. sex is sex, that's how babies are made. apparently you are too young for such things if you're asking a question like this.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	ROFL<br>   That is very very false information.|`|AA11476951	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|kGkUG0fKaa	And this is the question where you know ( & I hope) that you should never have SEX!!!!<br>  <br>  So Sad...So SAAAAAAAAD!|`|PwhrTNZraa	Heck NO.

6L9jJnchaa	Most people don't even have it.  I've been pregnant twice and never did.  I asked a question about this already and 9 out of ten people said they never had it.  So yes, you could definitely still be pregnant.|`|AA12384088	Yes, I never had implantation bleeding. I would say a lot more do not<br>  than do.|`|AA11251271	I hope this bleeding is not a required of early pregnancy.  I am nearing the end of my TWW and have had no spotting at all.  My period usually spots a day or two before it starts and I haven't even had that.  Baby Dust to us both!!!!!|`|miOor5SRaa	They say only 2% of women expierience implantation bleeding..i hope u get your BFP good luck.|`|oiJITSNZaa	no need to have implantation bleeding though some do...take a pg test|`|AA10961212	YES|`|S5x6lDS5aa	Yes you can still be pregnant. Implantation bleeding does not occur in every women's pregnancy. take a home pregnancy test and good luck :)|`|txSiQc7Waa	From what I've read implantation bleeding only happens in a small percentage of women... so it's perfectly normal to not have it... Good luck and baby dust to you!|`|6IShTvYOaa	most women do not get this i think its like 1 out of 4 so i wouldn't worry its not that common and Good Luck!
3hBQz33Yaa	My sister is an OBGYN and i know she WILL NOT do a  c section unless its needed. I don't think any respectable doctor would to be honest. C sections are fairly major surgeries. Takes longer to recover than with a vaginal birth and there is always the risk of infections in the incision.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	Usually there needs to be a medical reason.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Medical reason.  No real doc will perform major surgery on someone just because.|`|l46COY9eaa	Many people (esp. hollywood stars!) are able to schedule them so that the baby is born on some kind of schedule. A lot of doctors will not do that of course, but there are some out there that will schedule one.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I've heard of people scheduling them ahead of time. Ask your doctor.
eytlIKITaa	You just said your wife went to an abortion clinic- why else would she go there?  And why don't you just ask her?!|`|xnhwmontaa	do the words ABORTION CLINIC mean anything to you! Duh I would say yes she did. Why else would a pregnant woman go to the ABORTION clinic and get a prescription from a doctor!. think guy!<br>  <br>  <br>  PS sorry your wife is a cold hearted  murderer|`|VESdMODnaa	obviously, i don't see why your wife would be going to an abortion clinic for ANYTHING unless she had an abortion. I mean you guys are married, why don't you just ask her...shouldn't she have told you about this?|`|1ntD4FQtaa	Talk to her about it, and ask her to re-test, or when her docs and midwife apps are? I had my 1st doc app a week after find out i was expecting.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Yd02fxpmaa	Abortion Clinics don't usually treat back pain bud...|`|DuqAsQyqaa	WELL... HMM LETS SEE WHY DIDNT SHE GO TO A REGULAR CLINC OR A ER ? OR A DOCTOR THE SKANK PROBABLY DID BABY KILLER|`|vjK8ZT20aa	I would have to say that yes I think your wife did have an abortion.  After my second daughter was born I was given the same medication because I began hemorrhaging and that was given to help my uterus contract back down.  I can't think of any other reason that it would be given to someone.
VS8mactUaa	If the baby is in a good position then yes they could tell that early, congrats.|`|C55pji5Qaa	They can always be wrong and the farther along you are the more accurate they become.We did find out at 16w2d that we were having two girls and multiple ultrasounds have confirmed this,but it is possible this early to be off.|`|2osuEr0naa	Usually for an ultrasound they want you to wait 18-20 weeks. Another thing you can be sure if it's a boy if your bump is really high up. Oh, and if you crave a lot of JUNK FOOD! Like me, i'm having a boy. <br>  Your next ultrasound should be accurate! :] <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10458750	I don't understand your question....have you got the 19 week one done or are you going to?<br>  Also, if you're not a high risk pregnancy, 3 weeks is really a small time frame to be doing another US.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I found out I was having a boy at 14 weeks, 5 days.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfiz4L3hnnU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfiz4L3hn...</a>|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yes they can tell some of the times. my friend found out she was having a boy at 14w 5d|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	If they tell you its a boy they are most likely correct. It is ususally only off that early if it still looks like a girl at that time.<br>  <br>  I found out about my boy at 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  CONGRATS ON YOUR BOY!|`|dTPg4uYzaa	an ultrasound is never 100% accurate I have heard some people were told they were having a boy then it turn out to be a girl at birth or vice versa so until the baby is out you cant be for sure
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No,too small. Around 5-7 weeks is when they would be able to see something.
B9KwqnuDaa	Take a test.|`|p0prrzf2aa	sounds like pms, but YES you could be pregnant. pee on a stick. best and easiest way!|`|QSodlfMraa	take the test.|`|2osuEr0naa	Usually one if the first signs of pregnancy is HEAVY discharge. But, you could also be starting your period as well. Wait a week or two and see. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You'll have to wait and test.|`|90zcKChJaa	you need to take a pregnancy test|`|6YR9vnxgaa	take the test and find out if you are.|`|augFVR08aa	take a test|`|W6S6WpsNaa	What do you expect us to say? TAKE A TEST!
QSodlfMraa	wait til missed period.|`|AA10015577	Wait to test after (if you do) a missed period.|`|hN6T7c6naa	buy pregnancy kit. to test.. but it only works accurate after 10-15 days... goodluck
CaaLsWAJaa	The possibilities are endless. You won't get a straight answer from this website or from any website. She needs to see a doctor or just let it be.|`|dTPg4uYzaa	she should go talk to her doctor about this if the blood was dark brown/black then it could be a serious problem to her health|`|jab795FPaa	Shes not drinking enough water|`|CwXr1M5Naa	That has happened to me before i freaked out but its no big deal if it continues then see a doctor. It can be because of birth control pills if she missed some or if she just started taking pills. don't worry.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't worry to much.|`|mZcdC90Uaa	Why doesn't she see a doctor if you think it is that serious?<br>  Stefani|`|0LA7EYHcaa	It was probably just a very light period. Has she started on contraceptives? This could be the cause. Also it sounds very like "breakthrough bleeding" - bleeding between periods.<br>  <br>  She can take a pregnancy test right now, and another one in a week.
3hBQz33Yaa	It looks like your lower but you are also bigger so it could just be the filling out. You would know by the feeling if the baby has dropped you would feel A LOT more pressure on your cervix and it would be more uncomfortable.<br>  BTW: Good luck! =)<br>  <br>  ADD: one of the signs of dropping is being able to breath easier so its possible that you have. The weight gain i dont think is a problem. You could always make a call to your dr. when the office opens just to be safe or you could wait until your next appt. and talk to her..also if your weighed and she thinks there should have been more gain she will address it. A dr. will expect a mother pregnant with her first to call and have more questions and concerns since everything is new to them and will be happy to answer them. =)|`|HgbJAKd6aa	it looks like you've dropped some congratulations best of luck to you and your baby hun|`|fjHpA5oiaa	I would say no. You're still pretty high up. Is this your first pregnancy? In your other pregnancies did you noticably drop a certain time before birth? For all three, I didn't "drop" till halfway through labor, so don't worry about  dropping to indicate that you are getting towards your goal. You look great though, and healthy! Good job! I don't know why you haven't gained weight, though. It's probably nothing. You do look bigger in the belly, so you could be putting on weight there, and losing it in other places.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	not really just a bit bigger. You will feel the extra pressure after baby drops
X6as2nOAaa	I was told by 3 different doctors to do it the opposite way she is still trying to figure it out and she is hungry you feed her the bottle first so that she is pretty content but could still eat more, then put her on the breast so she is not so hungry and frustrated she is just calm and then she will get more used to it. It will take time but it will be easier to do it this way for both of you.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	I'm not an expert but from the way the lactation consultant acted at the hospital when a nurse tried to give my baby a pacifier it's like, a HUGE deal...this whole "nipple confusion" thing. The LC always had me switching sides and positions so my son wouldn't get used to one way and he'd be more adaptable to different nipples. <br>  <br>  It seems like your baby is a prime example for what they were trying to avoid.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	It is easier for babies to drink formula out of a bottle because they don't have to suck really hard to get it. When a baby feeds off the breast they have to suck much harder to extract the milk and because of this they get frustrated because it is not easy for them. I had issues will breastfeeding due to cracked nipples and I couldn't feed him and I thought he would get nipple confusion, while I let my breast heal. My doctor told me that babies are lazy (so to speak) and they want to do what is easier and bottles are easier then breast. Don't just go to the bottle. Contact the hospital where you had your baby or a lactation consultant, they can help you. Just keep on trying, it will work out. Your baby will really benefit from breastfeeding. Hope this helps.|`|0NRAdYTsaa	Bottles are much easier to feed from. Breastfeeding takes a lot of work. Keep trying, and maybe start the flow for her. To be sure it's the work of eating, try pumping and putting it in a bottle. If he rejects it, it's something about your milk, and not the work it takes to get it. Your milk changes flavor with what you eat. Stay away from caffeine, salt and grease and try again. Good luck!|`|rbj2zsIuaa	You need to give it some time.  She pulls away because maybe she's not sucking as hard as she needs to. Also remember that she is getting the very beginning of the milk called colostrum sorry didn't spell that right.  but anyway don't give up. Keep trying your milk should have already come in so maybe she's getting impatient right before let down of milk. Don't give up keep trying.|`|eJ539ejpaa	She is till learning the process.  I would see if you hospital/clinic has a lactation consultant.  Your daughter may prefer the bottle and not the breast yet.  The consultant can help you to transition her back to the breast.  The consultant at my hospital helped with my son who had trouble latching on to one breast.  Keep trying and Good Luck!|`|rwhqgTB6aa	Have you been pumping to keep up your milk supply? If not, you just might not have enough milk coming out quickly enough to satisfy her. If you are sure your supply is adequate, make sure you are positioned correctly and your daughter is latched on properly. Then try gently massaging your breast to encourage letdown. Once she is getting the milk she should take over. <br>  <br>  I strongly encourage you to contact a lactation consultant or find a local chapter of La Leche League to help you through this. Ask your pediatrician or the hospital where you gave birth for a referral. Good luck.

MOsStEbqaa	Nope it is just a wives tale.|`|QSodlfMraa	no :).|`|fMnzjULCaa	It's an old wives tale but it's one of my favorites. The myth in my family has always been over 160's girl, under boy. I have a huge family & has worked from as far back as I can remember. My baby was always in the 140s & 150s & it was right, he's a boy. But seriously it is an old wives tale. Doesn't hurt for fun though! Another one that always seems to work is that the 7th person's present opened at a baby shower is the next one to have a baby. They are just for fun but the last shower I went to, I was 7th & I was the next one pregnant!|`|1qnbvUYPaa	Nope! =]<br>  <br>  My little girl is always between 136 and 142, according to the wives tale she should be a boy, and she's def a little girl|`|6L9jJnchaa	Nope|`|AA10458750	No!|`|umca7pwoaa	An old wives tale says that a high heart rate indicates a girl baby.<br>  <br>  I'm due in June with a baby boy who's heart rate has been in the upper 150's the whole time, so that pretty much kills this myth.

kiAQi91laa	A lot of doctors in India do believe this to be partially true and the British Journal of Nutrition has documented a study on the effects of papaya and pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The main points of this study is that -><br>  <br>  The results of the present study suggest that normal consumption of RIPE PAPAYA during pregnancy may not pose any significant danger<br>  <br>  However, the UNRIPE or semi-ripe papaya (which contains high concentration of the latex that produces marked uterine contractions) could be unsafe in pregnancy. ( reactions are induced spasmodic contraction of the uterine muscles)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutritionsociety.org.uk/bjn/088/bjn0880199.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritionsociety.org.uk/bjn/0...</a><br>  <br>  Now, the study doesn't state that eating unripe papaya will AVOID a female from conceiving.  If you're hoping for a natural birth control it is best not to have sex.  <br>  <br>  Relate this food with other like regular coffee or sodas.  If you're trying to conceive it eat only ripe papaya and not much of it before and during pregnancy.|`|PCK5bJt3aa	This is a strange question, if this were the case then many people in Latin America would not be having babies!! If trying to conceive in your goal, Papaya does not affect fertility.
sEqc7oaxaa	She can go to her local health department and usually get a test done for free, sometimes it costs a little money. If she has a positve pregnancy then she can try and get on Medicaid and WIC if her parents don't meet the maximum income.

Buy a whole ginger root from the store, grate some of it with a cheese grater (use the finer grate if you can) into a pot. Over the grated up ginger, pour a good amount of water, enough to make a few mugs of beverage. Bring just to a boil, turn off the flame, pour it in a mug (leave the chunks at the bottom! Just pour out the amber colored liquid). Drink when cool enough. It's going to be a little bitter, the taste you'll have to get used to. Drinking this ginger tea will make you feel better for a little while, then you'll want to heat some of your brew up and drink some more, throughout the day maybe. I found that the more I drank, the less sick I became, and the more I liked the taste of ginger.|`|ppyaqtZGaa	I had real bad morning sickness with this baby too.  I did sea sick bands/accupressure, and meds from my doctor.  That seemed to help. I tried Pepsi and peppermint that a friend recommened for me, but the Pepsi gave me indigestion....BAD!

Or go to your GP and request a blood test as they are more accurate in early pregnancy :) good luck and lots of baby dust :)|`|0NRAdYTsaa	Sometimes the test takes a while to detect the Hcg in your urine. Try again in a week or two on the first pee in the morning. It sounds like you're pregnant to me, but I'm not a doctor, just a mom.

Just continue to watch what you eat, drink, smoke, breathe (paint, exhaust, hair dye etc.)|`|lY2XI8kUaa	you could be pregnant. wait a week or two and take another test|`|cFhgBmTuaa	try testing first thing in the morning...
Z0odTlyQaa	Your step-father must actually care about you. He sees this from the male perspective, that tongue piercings are whorish, and he doesn't want guys to look at you that way.

If you are younger than 16 or 17, I think they have a right to keep you from doing it. Otherwise, sit down and ask them what thier concerns are and see if you can't meet in the middle somewhere.

Although she has let her have her ears and navel done.<br>  <br>  You know, I actually do not find them particularly attractive.

I was lucky it never have been affected or gave me issues.<br>  <br>  (my navel rejected twice, so I was putting myself at risk for infection with a tongue piercing).<br>  <br>  I had to take it out that next summer due to military, but I got it repierced at 19 and I have had it since with no issues. (24 this year).<br>  <br>  My mom tried to do the horror stories once she found out I got it pierced the first time, but stubborn me felt I would be okay, which luckly I am. <br>  <br>  But with in a few months, she was buying me tongue rings and making remarks like "I will rip that out of your tongue if you don't quit yapp'n" (talking alot lol).  but she got "over it".<br>  <br>  Many people who get infections either got it done incorrectly (unprofessionaly) or don't take care of it as directed. <br>  <br>  All you can do is keep discussing it with your step dad and mom. Until then, might have to wait til 18.<br>  <br>  P.S. It does not represent "sexual favors".<br>  <br>  Some people are so immature thinking those with a tongue ring will easily suck a guy off or they are sexual.  I was a virgin for awhile after I got my tongue pierced for the first time. <br>  <br>  <br>   Amazed me how many people are so judgmental, but yet they call themselves a "Christian"....|`|9zwSclnLaa	If your parents are anything like mine they stick to the "not until you are out of the house and can pay for it yourself" rule.

9OsjdsrZaa	It sounds like he thinks he is playing a game.  Which is not uncommon for children that age.  All of my children have gone through similar stages when we switched them into their toddler/big beds.  <br>  <br>  With my oldest, she would wonder around the house at night...while we were clueless in bed.  I finally resorted to putting up a child gate at her door to keep her in at night...for her own safety.  Of course this didn't settle the stay in bed issue, but gave me a little piece of mind.<br>  <br>  I have since learned with my other 2 that there are much easier ways to keep them in bed and doing well.  To be honest, your best bet is to tweak any advice to conform with your child's personality.  I have tried using the same technique with all 3 of my kids and have had to change them in some way to work best for them.<br>  <br>  Drain him of energy during the day.<br>  Make sure he gets lots of activity during the day.  Running him ragged will make him much more amenable to hitting the sack at night. It will also keep him in a deep sleep.  Does he take a nap during the day?  If so, maybe you need to shorten his nap time, or make it earlier in the day so he will be plenty tired come the evening.<br>  <br>  Start reducing his activity level around dinner time.<br>  Turn off the stereo and television, give him a warm and soothing bath, and read him some bedtime stories. Keep his bedtime routine predictable, and expect that it'll take at least an hour for him to get tired and relaxed enough to head off to dreamland.<br>  <br>  While he settles in for the night, stay close.<br>  I often stay in my room up stairs where they can see me.  It is soothing to them to know that you are near should they need you, but you are not in their room. They have to understand, however, that this is not talking time...it is sleep time.  This is a hard step for me...because this is supposed to be my time.  However, I promise that it will get better with time.<br>  <br>  Remember to praise him when he does stay in bed.  Positive reinforcement works great with a 2 year old.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Npr6EvOjaa	tell him a story? i know two year olds have the attention span of mosquitoes...|`|bvG0sglXaa	Your son laughing when you are putting him in bed is strange. Maybe it is all for attention. Two year old kids do odd things for attention. <br>  Try having a talk with him about this when it is not the middle of the night. Tell him he needs to stay in his own bed. Explain to him that you will not be taking him to his own bed anymore. He will go by himself like a big boy. When he shows up in your room at 2 AM just tell him to go back to bed. This is what I did with my son and it worked like a charm. Hope it works for you too.|`|02d8b50a9d75922bc496ff2a4c76185baa	When my 2 year old made the transition from crib to toddler bed we took her to the store so she could pick out her new bed comforter and sheets.  She was so excited to sleep in her new bed that she did not get off at all and has been sleeping without problems ever since.  She is now 3.  Maybe a good option is to take him to buy new sheets and let him pick them out.  Start a bedtime routine, if you dont already have one.  At least one hour before bed, start doing quiet activities like watching a video, reading a book or coloring.  If he laughs, dont let it show that is distresses you, just calmly tell him that it is bed time and walk away.  He cant really hurt himself falling out of a toddler bed, they are like 1 foot off the ground.  Dont come back unless he gets really aggitated and then start removing things from his room everytime he gets off.  You know what his currency is, what does he love the most?  A blankie, a stuffed animal, a special toy?  Start taking them out of the room one by one with each offense.  You have to make it very clear that YOU are in charge and he will get the picture.|`|rJ5xf8qYaa	You are right to keep putting him back in bed. But you need to keep putting him in bed until he stays there. He will laugh at first but he will get tired of it very quickly. Don't talk to him when you put him back in bed. You need to do this even during the night. He seeds to learn how to sooth himself to sleep.|`|bBP1Xlnkaa	We tried our girls in toddler beds at around 2 1/2 years of age. It didn't work out, and they are back in their cribs. Our girls were doing the same thing, and having them miss out on their daily naps just caused havoc through our house. We plan on trying again at about 3 when they are more capable of being "reasoned" with- as much as you can reason with a toddler/preschooler LOL. Maybe you should wait until 3? Perhaps he is just not ready yet for the "big boy bed" yet. Not all the wee little ones are ready at 2.|`|LGS2RtDdaa	(making joke) Strap him down onto his bed, tape his mouth shut and stay with him in his room so that he's asleep the whole night.

cY8DgJv5aa	Well, it depends what you and your husband like to do together.  My husband and I went on a few really nice trips while I was pregnant (although I never knew they were actually called a 'babymoon').  We enjoy Vegas, so we went there.  We don't drink or gamble, we just like all the shows and such.  We also really enjoy just typical 'date night' type stuff, so we would go out on really cute dates that we knew we wouldn't be able to do once the baby was here.  Dinner at a candlelit restaurant, a movie at a theater, a long quiet stroll through the park, snuggling by the fireplace......

All it takes is for some semen to get near your vagina, doesn't matter much how it gets there.  The chances probably aren't really high, but there is always that chance.<br>  <br>  Edit:  And NO sperm does NOT die as soon as it "leaves the penis".  It doesn't survive for very long, but long enough.  Once the semen dries out, then the sperm is dead, but as long as it's still "wet", there's a chance there are some lively little sperm still.|`|x2GQ8n6Oaa	yes, you don't need to have penetrative sex to become pregnant, pregancy occurs when sperm fertalises an egg, and that sperm can get inside of you another way, e.g. if you or your partner have semen on your fingers for instance, before a man ejaculates he releases a few drops of semen which contain millions of sperm and it takes just one to make you pregnant.<br>  <br>  I don't quite know how much of a chance you have of actually getting pregnant this way, but I know that it is possible.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, it's not likely, but it happens sometimes.  If you have been getting naked with your boyfriend, it only takes a drop of semen to make contact with your vagina, and then LOTS of little sperms go egg-hunting.<br>  <br>  Wait until your period is due, then test with your first morning urine.  If it's negative, wait another week and test again.  If it's still negative, get birth control from a doctor.  If you're getting naked with your boyfriend, you won't be a virgin for long.  If it's positive, see a doctor for prenatal care.|`|WhzOlOiEaa	technically yes as you dont need to have sexual intercourse to get pregnant.  Y ou could get sperm into the vagina / uterus through your opening but the chance is a bit slim.<br>  <br>  why do you think you could be?|`|Z51fjE2Raa	If he ejaculates near your vagina...

But it is highly unlikely.|`|aY6EjDwjaa	yes.<br>  if you have oral sex and fool around e.t.c its REAL easy to get pregnant<br>  sperm can live on your skin for like 5 hours.<br>  so BE AWARE|`|f1To9XHkaa	Yes Yes Yes|`|aXESNuBKaa	if sperm gets near your vagina, then yes.
MHOxPs8Oaa	Then tell him if you are going to act like a little baby and won't go to the bathroom you're going to wear these. (show him the diaper) It doesn't sound that great I know, but that's how my 4 year old nephew is he has wet himself because he won't quit playing he games to go to the bathroom and his mom and dad would stop him from playing the game in the middle of it to make him go, but that didn't work. They didn't let him play games for awhile, but that didn't work right as he played them again he would do the same thing.  So they resulted to diapers and it quickly stopped.  Maybe you could just limit the time to him playing it 30 minutes at a time and make him go before he plays.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	then obviously you're not done potty training... take away the PS2 ... that'll keep him motivated to pee whenever he NEEDS to not whenever he wants to.  lessen liquid towards bedtime and peeing should be the last thing he'll do before he closes his eyes for bedtime.|`|2pxiK9waaa	It's very normal for some leakage while playing. He's concentrating on playing and not on going potty. <br>  <br>  Making him go every hour would work--you just need to be consistent. Set an alarm or timer to go off and he has to go. You could also require him to go potty before he's allowed to play PS2 or with toys. He shouldn't be playing PS2 for that long of a stretch, anyway. He needs to get up and stretch every fifteen minutes. <br>  <br>  If he pees, he cleans it up and he has to put his clothes in the laundry. You could also do a reward chart for him and if he goes so many days without an accident while playing, he gets some small treat.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	instead of reacting with negatives, try a reward chart. every time her goes for a wee in the toilet he can have a star on his chart. once he gets 5 stars he can have a treat - 10mins extra staying up after bed time, a sweet, 10p more pocket money...i dunno...ask him what treats he would like. talk it through with him so he understands and feels part of it all. u could also start him with a jar of 10p coins, if he pees himself take out 10p, when he goes to the loo add 10p. he'll get it at the end of the 1st week when he has no money. next week he'll try more.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	I was having the same problem with my daughter...she is 4 now.  She was using the bathroom fine, never wetting herself or anything at school or when we were out...but as soon as we got home it was a helpless case.  I tried everything from rewards to punishment...time out...candy....no candy...taking toys....schedules...etc.  <br>  <br>  What worked for ME, is I finally got sick of it and I told my husband one day....I AM NOT PUTTING A PULL UP ON HER....because she knows that's my way out after getting frustrated with her.  So I started that same day and continued for about 4 days...everytime she would pee on herself...right out pee...not try to get to the bathroom, not tell me she did it...just pee on herself and just go about her buisness, I literally had her come sit in the living room with me, facing me...so she couldn't see the tv, and sit there for an hour.  Then when she got up, I sent her to the bathroom, and back to play.  Like I said, it only took about 4 days, and that worked....because you and I know an hour is a long time but for a child its FOREVER!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|LGS2RtDdaa	Well, put a diaper on him (if he doesn't) or put cloth diapers on him. A cloth diaper would be better 'cause that's what my mom put me in to train me. Uggh. Go for that.|`|FM6r0i04aa	There could be a number of reasons not solely connected to the game playing, although I do appreciate that this is when you have noticed it happening.

I only searched for a few mins though.<br>  <br>  2) America is one of the most lax countries as far as this goes. Some doctors will perform abortions as late as 20 to 21 weeks. It is typically noted that "viabitlity" (which is an abstract term that has to do with the technology we have and NOTHING to do with the baby) is after 22 weeks.<br>  <br>  3) I will list them here:<br>  Menstrual extraction<br>  A very early suction abortion, often done before the pregnancy test is positive.<br>  <br>  Suction<br>  The abortionist first paralyzes the cervix (womb opening).  He then inserts a hollow plastic tube with a knife-like tip into the uterus.  The tube is connected to a powerful pump with a suction force 29 times more powerful than a home vacuum cleaner.  The procedure tears the baby's body into pieces and the hose frequently jerks as pieces of the baby become lodged.  The placenta is then cut from the inner wall of the uterus and the scraps are sucked out into a bottle.<br>  <br>  Dilatation & Curettage (D&C)<br>  Uncommon today and used during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.  This is similar to the suction procedure except that the abortionist inserts a curette, a loop-shaped steel knife up into the uterus.  He then cuts the placenta and baby into pieces and scrapes them out into a basin.  Bleeding is usually profuse.<br>  <br>  Dilatation & Evacuation (D&E)<br>  Performed during the second trimester (4-6 months) of pregnancy.  This method has largely replaced saline and chemical abortions, which too frequently resulted in live births, a complication from the abortionist's perspective!  A pliers-like  instrument is needed because the baby's bones are calcified, as is the skull.  There is no anesthetic for the baby. The abortionist inserts the instrument into the uterus, seizes a leg or other part of the body and, with a twisting motion, tears it from the baby's body.   This is repeated again and again.  The spine must be snapped, and the skull crushed to remove them.  The nurse's job is to reassemble the body parts to be sure that all are removed.<br>  <br>  D & X  (Partial Birth) <br>  Also used for advanced pregnancies.  The cervix is dilated to allow passage of a ring forceps.  A foot or lower leg is located and pulled into the vagina.   The baby is extracted in breech fashion until the head is just inside the cervix. The baby's legs hang outside the woman's body.  With the baby face-down, scissors are plunged into the baby's head at the nape of the neck and spread open to enlarge the wound. A suction tip is inserted and the baby's brain is removed. The skull collapses and the baby is delivered.  Sharp and suction curettage is continued until the walls of the womb are clean.  <br>  <br>  Hysterotomy<br>  This method is usually used late in pregnancy and is likened to an "early" Caesarian section.  The mother's abdomen and uterus are surgically opened and the baby is lifted out.  Unfortunately, many of these babies are very much alive when removed.  To kill the babies, some abortionists have been known to plunge them into buckets of water or smother them with the placentas.  Still others cut the cord while the baby is still inside the uterus depriving the baby of oxygen. <br>  <br>  Salt Poisoning a.k.a. "Candy Apple Babies:"<br>  Most often used after the first trimester (first three months).  The abortionist injects a strong salt solution directly into the amniotic sac (fluid surrounding the baby).  The baby breathes and swallows it, is poisoned, struggles, and sometimes convulses. It takes over an hour to kill the baby.  The mother delivers the dead baby in a day or two (sometimes alive!).  Why "candy apple" babies?   The corrosive effect of the salt solution often burns and strips away the outer layer of the baby's skin.  This exposes the raw, red, glazed-looking subcutaneous layer of tissue.   The baby's head sometimes looks like a candy apple.  Some have also likened this method to the effect of napalm on innocent war victims.  This technique was originally developed in the concentration camps in Nazi Germany. (source: Abortion and Social Justice, NY: Sheed & Ward, 1972) Read about Gianna Jessen, who survived a salt poisoning abortion.  <br>  <br>  Prostaglandin Abortions<br>  Three forms, two are injected and one is a vaginal suppository.  Its first approved use was for "the induction of midtrimester abortion."  The hormone produces a violent labor and delivery of whatever size baby the mother carries.  If the baby is old enough to survive the trauma of labor, it may be born alive, but is usually too small to survive.  In one article, among the complications listed was "live birth!"<br>  <br>  RU-486<br>  A drug that produces an abortion taken after the mother misses her period.   Its effect is to block the use of an essential hormonal nutrient by the newly-implanted baby, who then dies, and drops off.  Note that RU-486 is not a contraceptive  because it does not prevent fertilization or implantation.  It is used only after the mother has missed her period and the baby is at least two to three weeks old, with a beating heart (the fetal heart begins to beat when the woman is four days late for her period).  It is no longer effective after six or eight weeks.|`|9EkFrApiaa	In same states partial birth is legal but I would say, yes-- Clinton made partial birth abortion legal and I am pretty sure it still is in some states.  I am not sure the latest date you can get an abortion but pretty much the procedure is the same wherever you go.

She's allowed to say "crap" which is another word for "sh*t" but I allow it. She actually does say "what the crap" lol which I think is funny. I use off words all the time instead of cussing. Childrend should be allowed to express themselves but not inappropriate ways, such as cussing. I say "what the heck" also. Fudge, Crud, Crapola, dang it, crap, all of which I'd rather my daughter say than cuss. She has cussed in the past thanks to her dad, and my brother. I explained to her those are BAD words and can not say them. BTW my kid is 5 :) I encourage her to express her feelings with words instead of actions and I always allow her to feel however she sees fit for the situation. Parents who do not allow their kids to feel end up making their kids bottle up and in the end ur asking for an explosion. If my daughter cries about something I tell her to go to her room until she's read to talk about the problem.

If you continue to spot and or pass any sort of clots, keep them in a jar (I know.. it's gross but it's good to do so the doctor can see what has been happening ).  You can also take another pregnancy test and see if it still shows pregnant cause as you miscarry your body depletes the hormone that triggers a test and it'll become fainter until it will show a negative reading.

The egg is alive only 12-24 hours. The best time for her to get pregnant would be to have sex from the 21st to the 24th.<br>  <br>  So, chances of her being pregnant are really low. If a couple does everything they can do to try and get pregnant chances are only around 30% likelihood of succeeding.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it. Pregnancy symptoms are so generic that it really could be anything. But she should take a test to be sure.|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah more than a month as past.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I would buy her a test just to be sure.  It'll but everyone's mind at ease. Then, take her to the doctor and get her on birth control.  You don't want this kind of scare again.|`|aohKqXraaa	Yes, she could possibly be pregnant.|`|LzWfHMZhaa	TAKE  THE TEST!!.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Take a test.|`|imG3nlnhaa	A woman's cycle begins with the first day of her period. A period can last  anywhere from 4-10 days, give or take.  About a week after her period ends, ovulation begins.  This is the time in which one egg is released from her ovaries.  Ovulation is the time in a woman's cycle where she is most likely to become pregnant.  Keep in mind that the sperm can live inside the fluid of the vagina for up to a week.  <br>  <br>  However, since your daughter had sex before her period, unless it was (at most) a week before ovulation, she did it at the time that is safest for a woman to have sex without getting pregnant.  <br>  <br>  If she was on some kinda of birth control at the time (as every woman should be on two forms of birth control before having sex, to be safe) then the likely-hood of your daughter being pregnant is not very large. <br>  <br>  However, with sex there really never is a way to know for sure, especially with someone with an irregular period.  Get a pregnancy test as soon as possible and hope for the best.  Encourage her to always use protection!|`|v1xAKwJ4aa	Yeah, takes a month. <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222123222AAMYCOH&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|pxTsBlOMaa	she could be pregnant. <br>  go to a doctor or get a test from the drug store.|`|lhAVoXNMaa	uh yes...werent you pregnat before...its been over a month take her to the doctor
Yn6pM2Xyaa	Miami is very colourful with bright pastel colours so that should be your colour theme.. turquois, peach, pink, lime green etc.  Foods?  South beach diet?  just kidding!! try this pink for ideas: <a href="http://miami.about.com/od/fooddrink/Food_Drink.htm" rel="nofollow">http://miami.about.com/od/fooddrink/Food...</a><br>  You could try making your own candles for the party in a sand mold so they look like they are covered in sand but its not messy..  also good because itll be size and shape you want.  Just use parafin wax melted, poured into a container with wet sand that has a hollow shaped how you want the candle to look.  Palm leaves are a must!  Real/fake from stores like Michael's or make your own with paper, tissue paper, etc.  Small shels scattered on tables for added decor.  Ladies can come wearing bikini tops and men with none! :)  Favours?  ummm shell necklaces for the ladies and shark tooth ones for the boys?  I'm guessing by the catagory you chose that alcohol is out of the question but you could go with mocktails.. tonnes of recipes online, then you can have fun glasswear to add to the feel.  Music is a personal thing, you could play cuban influenced music for a latina feel or just go with your favorites, or even mix it together! If yoou want the retro miami feel then go for the miami vice look with lots of neon and men in pastel t-shirts and pale jacket/slacks.  miami sound machine music and miami vice theme song.  Have so much fun with this, I'm jealous and I think I might have to do my daughter's 3rd birthday with a theme like this rather than our usual bbq.|`|0TEvBSQyaa	Think of the sunset on a beautiful white sandy beach.  The reds, purples, greens, oranges.<br>  <br>  Decorations - Palm tree(s) (Inflatable!), Them outside lights (the colourful lanterns)<br>  <br>  Food - Could be a barbeque kind of style, like the hot dogs, chips because thats what you get on a beach or near a beach the little hot dog stands (not actually get one!) And the little umbrella's to put in the drinks.|`|NnIBtVPRaa	Check out www.kickcreations.com, they have beach themed favprs, as well as many products such as candy wrappers and such that can be personalized to look however you would like and say anything!
AA12033653	You see your GP for this!  Just make sure that they know you are pregnant.|`|QDQwKbM6aa	I would go to your OB|`|AA11537580	GP|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Call the OB office and ask the receptionist.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	When I was pregnant, I had to go to my general practice doctor of I was sick or my insurance wouldn't cover it.  My insurance only covered trips to the OB that were directly related to the pregnancy.  You might find out what your insurance covers.  I also would advise seeing your general practitioner because OBs are specialty doctors and don't usually deal with sick patients.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	My midwife didn't listen to me either even though I'm regular as clockwork and knew when I had conceived. My baby was six days early by my calculation by theirs three weeks but I knew I was right. Don't worry about it it's better to have them project it past what you think because if you do go 40+ weeks you'll have to undergo stress test and all sorts of stuff to make sure the baby is ok. Bet you the baby will come around when you think and not them for all their fancy technology they sure so get it wrong a lot of the time. They really should listen to us more often. Try not to worry, it's just a date written on a piece of paper.|`|QSodlfMraa	when it is time to have an ultrasound it will tell you your correct due date.|`|aohKqXraaa	For now, stick with the due date the clinic gave you until you get a little farther along, your due date could change.
miOor5SRaa	I dont believe it should matter, However i quit smoking 48 days ago because DH & i are ttc, My mom smoked during her pregnancy with me & I was born in nicotine with drawl! I was in an incubator for 3 weeks and my legs would shake uncontrollably for approx 3 months after, the Dr said that was lucky! So if your ttc you should quit remember if your going to be pregnant you cannot be selfish in the decisions you make because you are not the only one that may have to live with the consequences!|`|eytlIKITaa	It shouldn't matter.  But why don't you quit smoking if you're ttc?  I know it's hard, I just quit 50-something days ago, because we're ttc.|`|4hsrILZbaa	Smoking can actually decreas your fertility...period. Smoking right after having sex, that one cig, doesn't affect anything specifically, but smoking in general is not ideal for conception. It certainly isn't good for pregnancy!|`|txSiQc7Waa	It may not hurt your chances of conceiving but it's no good for the development of your baby... I'd quit before actively trying to conceive.
sbeoF50gaa	If it was my daughter under 18 and pregnant, I don't think you COULD kick them out and I don't think I would anyway. But I'd personally just make sure she takes care of that baby and not me. I'd probably talk to her about adoption since I'd think it would be the best choice for her. Some things kids need to learn the hard way. If she wanted to keep the baby, then SHE would be the one to take care of it, NOT me. She'd have to juggle a part time job AND school and learn how hard it is. Learn to grow up really fast.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	You don't say how old the girl is but here in NY you can go to court and have her declared a person in need of supervision or a (PIN) and she would be put into the foster care system or you can find a program that takes pregnant teens and helps them finish school and teaches them to be parents.  No you can't just kick them out it would be considered abandoning them, but you can make other provisions you need to find out what programs are available in your area and which ones can help you.|`|ncSpnEI7aa	well it not all parent are like that kicking kid out since they are pregnant. it might be the kids who have tough strict parent that how it happen. well there always option living with bf or gf home if one of them get kick out. it happen to one of my friend but her bf family welcome her and their unborn to her bf hom to live it all depend on the situation.|`|3vToYNA2aa	Let the teens learn their own lesson...but don't turn your back on them...support them :-) even though I'm against teen pregnancies but if it already happened then I would support my kid as much as I can help her to be a better mom:-)|`|y9HO1dWsaa	It's terrible to kick your own PREGNANT child out of the house just because you don't want to help them.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	It would be wrong to kick your pregnant teenager out.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	No|`|jTAWyIzqaa	I would let nature takes it course. The first answer on here sums it up. You can look at it as heaven sent. God gives you a miracle, everyone usually doesnt turn around and give it away. There are people out there that would die to have kids. Besides if the teenager wants to keep it, it'll make her or should make her much more responsible. Its her body and her child she should decide. Not unless someone just cringes a the thought of becoming a grandma a lil sooner than 'she' wants.|`|82PkTDwwaa	Not all parents kick their kids out. Some kids say they've been kicked out when in actual fact they have not, they just want to live away from home and collect the dole, party up and live with no rules.<br>  I don't think kids should be kicked out. They are a life time commitment, but I've heard some kids make it near impossible to have a healthy family environment. I've not ever heard of anyone getting into strife for kicking their kids out pregnant, but that isn't to say it won't happen!|`|3wzQHVQ1aa	i say yes|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I have seen teens kicked out for this. I will not kick them out and I will try to help them as much as I can.|`|sxecXFgraa	I would never kick my daughter out because she got pregnant.  Both my kids know they will always have a bed at my house, regardless of the situation they are in.  They will have to be productive members of the house, but they will have a place to stay, with or without a baby.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	A parent cannot legally kick out their child when they are under 18. That doesn't mean that it never happens though. If the parent's don't kick the teenager out they can make it very difficult to live at home and the teenager might just leave.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I don't know who gave me the thumbs down, it's not like I condone that behavior, I was just saying that's what could happen. If I were in that situation I would be very disappointed but I would still support them.|`|BQsVPV9Yaa	I'd probably suck it up, stop being selfish, and realize its not up to me to decide if a baby is coming into the world and into my home.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Yeah if really fed with teenager's behavior I would kicked their *** OUT! I don't care if unless they really respect but know never prefect and welcome stay here but don't proud for if keep the baby because so **** up!|`|AA10475412	I'd be very disappointed, but not kick her out of the house.
EMKuBql8aa	I think everyone has their moments. I'm sure you and everyone on here is probably nice, normal people.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I have my bad moments. I am very passionate about many things and I do have an explosive personality. But I always stay true to myself and my beliefs. I would hope my children would be proud of that.    Edit: really Des? Im actually less outspoken on here because I realize others do not get my sarcasm and whit without the tone of voice, body language and playfulness of my real life personality.|`|N48qV69daa	You know, theres always going to be those times when we do things we arent proud of. I know though, the responses I give are honest, truthful, and mature. I try not to lose my temper, and sometimes I do, but its only human. Our children sometime is going to realize no ones perfect, not even there parents.|`|agTCqkLDaa	I try to be really nice on here because I don't believe that just because you can't see someone's face they don't have feelings.  Of course I've had my moments in which that was the absolute last draw, but I just always try to remember that regardless of the fact I don't see a face that person still has feelings.    Honestly, I've never said anything to which I'm absolutely appalled, but there are some people on here who I feel are bordering on sociopath because they're so callous.    I don't have kids yet, but I do teach, and I always try to think about them.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I try to be honest so I have nothing to be ashamed about.      I can be sarcastic at times but I don't think that's a bad thing.    No one's perfect.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	The way I answer questions on here is exactly the way I am at home.  My children live with me they have seen both the sarcastic and compassionate side of me. I have nothing to be ashamed of.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I always try to be nice and hopefully helpful. I think if my child could read he would be proud of my answers.|`|5p7gpj36aa	Every once and a while my son will stand by me when I'm on and read my answer to something...  I will tell him to leave the area if it's something I don't want him to read.  I used to be more outspoken than I am now -- I try to think things through a little more.|`|W4MJiYYfaa	I try to be nice to people, for the most part, on here.     Honestly, in real life, I might be a little nastier when someone tried to question my abilities or choices as a mother, or question my choices in general.|`|OThwE3Whaa	As someone who has been on answers for years, I have come to realize that things come and go.  Users come and go.  People have bad days, and they have good days.  That's life.      I would hope that my son wouldn't waste his time on YA when he is old enough to read.    Some of the people on here haven't been on here long enough to know who was rude to whom when.  So be it.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I have answered questions in the heat of the moment and then seen it on the page and thought O MAN!   And that just happened to me, and even though I instantly clicked on it to edit, I was already blocked, and I couldnt do anything.    But that was my reaction, I have always been passionate about someone picking on an innocent person.    But I generally have very respectful answers that refelct my personality.  I have strong opinions and Im a passionate person and I tend to explode easily. Whether on the good side or bad..  But looking back, Ive had my moments...but I am not ashamed at all.  Im real, and I think my son will respect that I stick up for the things I believe in.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I'm less outspoken in real life because I'm more comfortable offering strong opinions when someone asked for them (they may not like them, but they did ask).    I would say I'm very comfortable with the vast majority of my responses on here.  There are a small handful that I've made that in retrospect I wish I had turned off the computer before making them.    Chad is very optimistic about us as a group (which probably says something about him:  usually people who think well of others are good people themselves and just can't imagine anyone's being different).  But I can't say I think that everyone on here is a great person.  I do think that many people on here probably are, and that a lot of good people on here, myself included (yeah, i'm a good person, lol), occasionally say things that they should not, and that set a bad example for the kids who use this forum.      *kitkat -- i get what you're saying (though i think you have charming sarcasm and wit even on the computer) but for me there's a huge benefit to conversations that involve an "edit" button before hitting submit.  and without that in real life i am very much more cautious about getting into certain conversations in the first place.  and i'm also quite hesitant to have a heated debate on abortion or religion or something with someone with whom i'm going to have to sit for an hour at our kids' soccer game next weekend than i am to have that same debate with a stranger.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	In real life, people rarely come up to me asking me to tell them what I think about parenting issues, social issues, etc.  And, whenever they do, I get to weigh what I know about them and how I want to affect our relationship, before replying.      I do the same here, I suppose, but *here* I don't know people beyond what they post -and- I don't really feel the need to maintain a future relationship by tempering my replies.  Additionally, *here*, every single 'question' is opening itself up for 'answers' - all of them.  I assume that people who ask a question know that they are likely to receive a variety of answers from a variety of people.      When I'm wasting time on here at home, the kids often look over my shoulder at what I'm typing.  I think it's fine for them to know that people have different ideas about things & that I take the time to think about and form opinions that I think are right for us, for me.  That I think about them enough to refine them & try to put them into words.|`|AA11210211	No I would be very prideful but then I do sometimes use language that I don't want them to use but that's about it,I want my children to see me for who I am and usually I answers questions like how I really am so I wouldn't care if they read all my answers,I am a pretty up front kind of person and if I make or did make a mistake I will call myself out on it so I wouldn't care....    EDIT:  but as the above poster said everyone has their moments!! lol|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	KitKat said it when she said "explosive personality".  That is totally me, and my kids know that.  I am very passionate in my beliefs, and have raised my children to be the same.  In real life, yes, I would say the same things I say on here, and have many times.  I just try to teach my kids that you can express a contrary opinion while still being respectful about it.  Not agreeing with someone else does not mean being rude.  It is not rude or disrepectful in any way not to agree with someone, the key is making sure you don't express it as though you are trying to be cross.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Most of my answers are totally what I would say in 'real' life.  I'm not ashamed at all.    I do get angry when I'm being attacked - but that's human nature, who doesn't?|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I'm actually pretty much the same as i am in real life.  I will get more fired up around people I am comfortable with in my real life than I ever would here.  I've only "lost my cool" maybe a couple of times.  I don't feel bad about it and it was never directly at a poster, but at someone who the poster said, said something, does that any sense?  I do however, give myself a free pass with trolls, though. as should everyone.  I'd be absolutely okay with my kids seeing what I type out.  I'm actually better at articulating my message with typing than verbally sometimes.  Verbally I have a tendency to let my emotions get the best of me.  Here I am able to actually express my thoughts more rationally and logically.    Thats me though.
82PkTDwwaa	I think it's great that you and your ex are able to talk about things so freely!! <br>  It's a rough situation to be in and I can understand that you are in a situation where you will offend someone if you cut contact with granny or not. Does your ex have any ideas? Can he sought granny out?<br>  I'd be inclined to let your son know that he is your world and you would miss him so much if he wasn't living with you and he is very lucky to have so many people who love him and want the best for him. He is better of with his mum right now, but visiting everyone is the best that can be done. There is only one him!!|`|sbeoF50gaa	it sounds like his grandparents are brainwashing him? I'd keep him away from them. No one should come between you and your child. As for what to say to him, you should ask him why. hear and understand how he feels, You can't really defend yourself unless you know where he's coming from.|`|3wzQHVQ1aa	i think you should give grandma a call. be the bigger person and let her know how you feel. otherwise its going to get worse.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	grama is filling his head with crap, i would  sit down and talk to her and let her know in no uncertain terms if it didnt stop he would no longer be spending the  night with her, there is no sense in putting an eight year old child int he middle of that mess like she is doing. your son is 8, he isnt old enough to make that decision, you just tell him that he needs to live  with mom and dad, because thats what children do. if push comes to shove tell him you are the boss and he doesnt get to choose. grama sounds like a real piece of work, trying to turn him against  you AND her son, id cut her out of his life before  i let her continue to pull him apart like that.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	He's eight years old. And "grandma" is probably promising he'll have lots of fun and no rules if he goes to live there. Not to mention who knows what all else she's filling his head with. He's young and impressionable. I think it's time you have a talk with her. And his father about what goes on while he's over there.|`|02SG8Dchaa	tell him that its ok to visit grandma and like it there but little boys live with their mommys and daddys. tell him that he has to live with mommy when he is with you because thats the way it is. sometimes you can pull the because i said so card. if we did everything our kids wanted just because they wanted it u could imagine what the world would be like. also talk to ur baby daddy and tell him that he should discourage her from letting her think its possible. he is a kid and sometimes we treat them as such. he is not ready to start making decisions about what best for him yet. Dont you agree? good luck mine isnt near that age yet.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	While I don't exactly how you feel, I'm a single mom and sometimes my daughter will ask to live with her dad.  Our circumstances are different because she hasn't ever been alone with him ever, he says he's going to get together with her and cancels, and doesn't provide any support, so she's definately reacting out of frustration with me and a belief that somehow, it'll be better with him!  Your son knows that it'll be better in some ways with his grandma because it sounds like she lets him do whatever he wants instead of having limits and being a good caregiver, like you are.  I think it's important that he says he just wants everybody to live together (which is probably true) and that he only says that right after he comes home from visiting her.  What does his dad have to say about it?  Is there anyway that he can either talk to his parents about it and ask that she not do it or actually keep your son at his house during the time that he visits?  Sounds like you have a good relationship with his dad, even if you don't with his parents.  That being said, I think it's completely normal for a little kid to want their entire families to live happily together and it's completely normal and probably good that they don't always get what they want.  Think of it this way---what if he asked (as my daughter did) to have a unicorn that flies?  You'd laugh and say, yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?  Unfortunately, it's not going to happen anytime soon,   Same thing maybe for your son?|`|UMRdHuuVaa	His nanna is probably the fun one, gives him lollies etc.<br>  She probably says "if you live with me, u can have this, that and all sorts of things"<br>  <br>  Keep him away from her, or tell her she can visit with him around you or his father - and if she doesn't like it...TOUGH.<br>  <br>  A child should be with their mother - end of story.|`|hChhOhOGaa	It sounds like grandma is being manipulative.  You need to be the mature one (since grandma obviously isn't) and sit her down WITH the father and work this out.  The only person getting hurt and confused in all this is the child.  Your need to make sure he's not being put in a situation where he feels he has to "choose" with whom to live.  Explain to grandma that if she cannot restrain herself from saying derogatory things about you in front of your child then she will no longer be able to have contact with them.  If she does not comply then you need to get a lawyer involved.  It's what is in the best interest of the child...NOT the grandma.

For whatever reason you feel you need to lose 15 pound (ie. pool party, upcoming sports event whatever), I'm sure it's not more important than your body.  I would suggest you cut down on the snacks, (slowly though you don't want to go into withdrawal), but I don't think you can lose 15 pounds in a month.  Just try to live a healthy lifestyle but DO NOT STOP EATING!|`|imyvj5y5aa	the only way you can do that in a healthy was is if youa re already extremly overweight.

Saldy, I have no idea on how to calculate that, look it up.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It's not safe to lose more than 1-2lbs a week unless you are extremely overweight. Consuming less calories than you use is the only way to lose weight.<br>  <br>  One pound of fat is 3500 calories. For the average person to lose 5lbs per week you would need to burn nearly that much a day and not eat a thing. If you don't eat your body will burn away muscle first which obviously isn't healthy.

RjdrO7DVaa	dont use icy hot patches ... they have medication that could affect the baby ... stick with a heating pack on low heat or try a warm bath (NOT HOT).  if the heat doesnt work then take a water bottle with ice in it and massage your back with that|`|Fei8s7vdaa	I am against using icy hot or hydrocortisone cream or other products because they do "seep" into the skin and not enough studies have been done.  Blue Emu is a brand sold at CVS that can work wonders, you might consider that.<br>  <br>  A nice warm bath, shower or heating pad with massage is a great way to relieve your achy mucles, just remember, 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off.  I am 20 weeks and my muscles need some help from time to time...especially the ligament pain!|`|33ILVB1Iaa	dont use icey hot patches<br>  meds in them could negativley affect ur baby<br>  trry something like a heating pad <br>  or a warm (not hot) bath..<br>  or ice it.<br>  if ur pain keeps up, just go to the doctor|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	yes use them ..and if it keeps up see a doctor .|`|uDLTAw8Taa	go to spa or your boyfriend or husband will massage your shoulder and back that help you feel better and<br>  icy hot patches.
txSiQc7Waa	Each woman's pregnancy is different. Just because something was so with your first, doesn't mean it's set in stone to work with your second. Your first could have registered at 4 days late but you didn't test until a week and a half late yanno? Something I will say though is just because a box says it will detect hcg on a certain day, doesn't mean that's what will happen. If your eggie implanted later, the hcg will be detected later. My advice is just to wait a few more days (Or until you're at the week and a half mark if it makes you feel better) and test again. I hope this helps and Baby Dust to you!|`|3KHS7Bgiaa	Ok --- late or absent periods are not a definite indicator!  I had mine through out my first pregnancy and skipped around on the last two. The most definite way is to go to the Doctor and get a blood serum test done.|`|5kMQAUVSaa	Hi, I would wait a week and half to two weeks if it still reads negative and your period still hasn't come then you should get an appointment with your doctor.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	im 15 days late and getting bfn's.. am i pregnant?  will know once i get results from blood test but doctor felt there was a possibility.. that being said some people just don't have enough of the hormone early on to show up on a test.. some never do though it is uncommon.  my previous two pregnancies both showed strongly after being a few days late.  test again in a week or so and in the meantime just dont stress over it.. i know easier said than done!  if still no period and bfn's then call your doctor for bloodwork.  *baby dust*|`|miOor5SRaa	Not always..Always remember to use FMU! And if you ovulated late the hpt will come up neg wait another week & test again. Hope you get a BFP..Good Luck
VXhOLgDEaa	My daughter had a cold when she was about 4-5 mths old..I didn't want to give her any medicine because she didn't have a fever...just runny stuffy nose, cough, and sneezing etc. <br>  <br>  I used these baby soothing sasline drops that you put in the nostril and use the blue suction thing to take out the gunk in the nose...it worked great for my daughter it cleared up her nose completely!..I used it whenever she got really blocked up...<br>  <br>  When you put him to sleep make sure he's elevated...because if he's sleeping flat on his back or tummy..that's going to be very uncomfortable when his nose is all clogged up. Put something under the mattress on one side ...so everything in his nose is flowing down..not just staying inside his nose which will he get him very agitated through the night.|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	It's more likely a little cold. There are some things that you squeeze into his nose, and it creates a vacuum effect, but we didn't have much luck with that thing. What worked for us was a hot shower. The hot water and the steam has an effect, and it would even clean out the dried up mucus.<br>  <br>  If you want to try this but are afraid of going into the shower with the baby, try wearing a t-shirt, it offers a little traction helping with the slippery part.|`|RPPrfphqaa	they have this thing at walmart its battery operated you just stick it up the nose and it sucks out the snot into a container you can empty..i think its genius! after you do that take a little bit a baby vicks vapor rub on a Q-tip and put up his nose and on his chest.|`|GJEFaaTWaa	Try running a hot shower for a few minutes and closing the doors. Then bring your baby in there and let him breathe the steam for 10-15 minutes. This always helps my daughter. Since the snot is colored, it is probably an infection. I would take him to the dr as soon as you can.|`|dHfFqVqhaa	my baby just got over his first cold.I just sucked the stuffiness out with one of those baby nose syringes.put baby vix on his chest.Sitting in a steamy room (turn on the shower and sit with him in there for a few minutes) also helps.and yes it could be due to teething (according to the nurse at the hospital where i went).|`|PIfaJRuoaa	You need a baby nose syringe.  You can purchase them at Target.  Here is what they are...<a href="http://www.segalsforchildren.com/store/shop_product.php?UPC=11856" rel="nofollow">http://www.segalsforchildren.com/store/s...</a><br>  My son is 3 months and has his first cold.  It's rough at bedtime.  Also, they make a baby Vick's Vapor Rub just for infants and you can rub that on his feet.  I use that along with the nose syringe before bedtime and it seems to help my son sleep better at night.|`|jKNjT3jLaa	IM NOT SURE IF ITS BECAUSE OF TEETHING BUT YOU SHOULD TRY INFANT MOTRIN & ALSO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF BABY VICKS... THAT SHOULD HELP IF NOT GO TO SEE YOUR BABY'S DOCTOR|`|WF44CGscaa	I would not go to the Dr. yet...slightly elevate the head area of the crib mattress...use a cool mist humidifier and  use a saline solution in the nose and clear it with a bulb syringe ...it might help.|`|rFtKFp03aa	It could be due to teething.. although no color is usually related when it comes to teething.. <br>  <br>  You don't get a cold because it is cold, it being summer is irrelevant to the situation.. <br>  <br>  Try getting a humidifier in his room and hopefully that will help.. <br>  <br>  Let nature work its course.. <br>  <br>  He is probably eating less so if he is wanting to eat more often than usual you might want to go ahead and feed him... <br>  <br>  He should be fine in a few days unless any other symptoms come up.. <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|AA11085356	It could very well be from teething, they get a lot of icky symptoms like that. My doctor told me to give my son warm apple juice to help open him up (no more than 4 oz juice per day mixed with 1/2 water) Also, I've read that you can fold up a blanket and put it under their mattress on one side to keep them a bit elevated. That'll help them sleep.
2irmTjQ3aa	No you are probably not pregnant. Having a bigger stomach or harder one is not a symptom, you would not feel that until about 3 months pregnant. I think you are fine, but of course there is always a small chance so you can take a pregnancy test just to make sure.|`|AA11615972	your FINE. you are not pregnant. You are bloated because you skipped your period by taking your next pack early. Your uterus didnt have a chance to shed it's lining, so it's building up more and more. Nothing to worry about. When you have your next period, everything will go back to normal.
f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	An ultimatum is ONE option...this sounds like he wants to compromise and be in the child's life.  Do you want your child to have an active father, or just someone to be a walking wallet?<br>  <br>  Stop running to everyone else for advice when your man is willing to talk to you, sit down and make some good agreements with him so the child will have two active parents who love it.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Get a lawyer to duke it out or let him leave after signing paperwork to rescind his rights that way if you meet someone else he can adopt your child without having to find her father again|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Get yourself a lawyer!!!!|`|sagjCRvKaa	First of all, this is this U.S. not italy, where does this monkey get off thinking he can do here what is done in other countries. This just makes me fuming mad, I say if he leaves don't let the door hit you on the way out. You can go to court with out him and get a judge meant for child support, in some states if he does not pay they will take his driver's license, and send you his tax refund. Even if you never go to court for child support, when you file for food stamps, or housing, they (the state) will go after him for child support. That will be beyond your control. It also sounds like you are afraid of him, get a restraining order, and when the judge asks you if you are afraid of him, tell the judge you fear for your life and your little girls life. Otherwise they will not issue you a restraining order. Also do not know what state you live in, but buy a gun, learn how to use it. In my state I have the right (as it should be) to protect my family and property with a gun. I have one and I practice with it. Do not be intimidated by him, do you have family you can turn to? I hope you are not living in Chicago.|`|RPPrfphqaa	sounds like he just doesn't wanna put out any money and threaten to leave you and his child if you do ask for money...<br>  total b.s..<br>  i would leave him...<br>  and even if he does leave the country you will know where he is and he will still have to pay you..<br>  what a chump.<br>  or maybe its better if you do never have to deal with him again.<br>  someone like that can't have good intentions for his own child either.|`|3wzQHVQ1aa	wow thats sad, this "man" can make a baby but not pay for it. I say take this SOB to court and get court order child support...And if he doesnt pay they will garnish his wages by any means. and if he leaves the country they will find him...ever heard of interpol?|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	You certainly have a fascination with international, deadbeat dads! <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could find a better hobby?<br>  <br>  Edit: lol, people... this isn't real... this kid asks this same question or one close to it daily if not hourly.|`|kD38Qwhsaa	spend the money and get a lawyer. someones not playing fair.see if you can find free consultation good luck don't give up we all want what's best for the child right?|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Timeout hit the nail on the head with this one. <br>  <br>  This is AMERICA not Italy. Who cares what they do in Italy? This isn't Italy!  Get a lawyer, get full custodity and let the loser go. I'd also change your locks, get a restraining order and then move so he can't find you or your child again.  Make sure your phone number is unlisted as well. ALSO- if he thinks the State Department won't deport his butt out of the US for this because he thinks he is "above our law because he lives under Italian law" he better think again..especially when he is a safety threat to someone!  He is not above the law or being removed from the US with a restraining order and child support due from him.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I would let him leave and never be heard from again, its pretty obvious he doesnt care about the child. i would rather be rid of him and have no child support from him as have to fight him my entire life.
p6AMoTs8aa	ok you can continue with once a day for another week. then you can substitute a formula feeding for a meal but just keep her formula as her main form of nutrition. my wic counselor gave me a schedule looks something like this;<br>  8am-baby wakes up feed formula<br>  <br>  mid morning (10-11am) give child cereal mixed with formula and some formula before or after the feedingmy daughter ate rice cereal followed by 3 oz of formula(she was thirsty)<br>  <br>  afternoon (2pm?)-regular formula feeding <br>  <br>  late afternoon-dinner you can feed your child plain peas or any vegetable you wish you can follow that with some formula you can also feed baby a fruit for dessert after eating vegetables<br>  <br>  for the rest of the day formula<br>  <br>  after baby is used to routine and ready to eat more you can add a feeding in the evening <br>  you can give baby any vegetable mixed with chicken or turkey|`|FfNjsqGvaa	I just went with the flow. There is no real right way. I just started feeding the rice cereal. Than I started doing it more often. Somedays he would none because we were in the city and so I just breastfed. There are really only 3 rules to weaning and they are due to safety and health issues:<br>  <br>  -start the baby on water in a bottle because fluids are very important and when he filled up on solid food, he would drink less. <br>  -the second rule is to introduce one new food and than keep that food for 2 or 3 days before adding a new one. This way if there is an allergy, you will immediately know which the new food is.<br>  -the third is that some foods cannot be digested well for babies. These are honey. Cows milk. And eggs.|`|IduItEH9aa	You don't have to wean her just because you're giving her solids.  Your baby is much to young to only eat solid foods right now. She still needs breastmilk (much better) and/or formula (ok) for another 6 months.|`|AA11789493	I would start feeding her rice cereal with a spoon from a bowl or cup  (mix the rice cereal with warm formula in a cup--something that's easy to hold). She won't eat much-2 or 3 teaspoons. She can have the rice at each meal, as well as baby applesauce or bananas or you can mash up a banana with a fork.  I know times have changed, but I think she's way too young to be weaned, per se.  I'd give her 3 meals a day along with about half the normal bottle amount with the meals.  I'd offer her a bottle mid-morning and before nap time in the afternoon and one before bed.  Having said that, I don't know what time she gets up and the time between breakfast, lunch and dinner in your house.  I think by 9 months she should start whole milk and be off the bottle by a year, but that will be replaced by a sippy copy.  Good luck.  You could give your pediatrician a call and maybe they can provide you with some literature.

This seems like the best choice for the child.<br>  <br>  D. Depending on where he goes you might be able to follow him legally for child support.  I wouldn't take his word for it.

He'd be hearing from my lawyer and getting a child support order<br>  <br>  B: Not over my dead body<br>  <br>  C: In the US a father can not just terminate his parental rights unless there is a willing party to step in and take financial responsibility for the child. I'd send the child support order. If he moves out of the country then... Good bye!<br>  <br>  D: Good Bye. It's NOT the mother's fault at all.
NkGTSqBdaa	The little bit of blood that you have could be implantation bleeding but it is too soon to test. For the best result wait until you have missed your period or are at least late and then test. You don't want to test to early and be disappointed with a negative result.<br>  <br>  The best of luck xx|`|G1j3Ja5Iaa	if you dont get your period on the 26th like your suppose to, then you should test the next day. if you are..it should show up by then...|`|IMJ9hNrLaa	I think you should wait until you actually miss your period. Its still really early to determine anything. Some girls do bleed a little bit a few days after sex but I've read its normal. <br>  <br>  Since your period is expected to come on the 26th, I would wait to take a test until after that. Give yourself at least 7 days just in case you have a late period. If you don't have your period with in a week, take a test.<br>  <br>  It could be all in your head. Its happened to a couple of friends of mine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DjUbYRzPaa	thats really weird as i have been feeling like u!!!<br>  <br>  been pregnant 5 times and my back hurt right from word go,lower back.<br>  <br>  every woman is different tho my sis only conceived 3plus wks ago ahe is an bits!!! sore back,boobs,head,feelin sicky,tired etc......<br>  <br>  good luck hope it turns out the way u want it xx|`|S5GP2nlUaa	You would only be like a week pregnant and wouldn't have any symptoms.

2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	It depends on the car seat and the shopping cart. I had the baby trend flexloc and it fit on the lower backed child seated shopping carts (like jewel's) but not the higher backed seats (like target) it was a pain. there is an indent in the bottom of the seat where they attach to the base... and that is what goes over the back of the child seat on the cart.|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	Almost all infant car seats will tell you in the instructions DO NOT place car seat seat on top of shopping carts.<br>  <br>  Even the The American Academy of Pediatrics says Parents and caregivers should never Place an infant carrier on top of the shopping cart. "Many infant-only car safety seats lock into shopping carts, and many stores have shopping carts with built-in infant seats. This may seem safe, but thousands of children are hurt every year from falling out of shopping carts or from the carts tipping over.<br>  <a href="http://www.aap.org/family/ShopCartPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aap.org/family/ShopCartPP.pdf</a><br>  <br>  To prevent parents from misusing the carriers, many stores are now purposefully making shopping carts to where you can not put the car seat on them.|`|u94HOVz7aa	I have a combi and it does NOT sit on a shopping cart.  the only place i have to put it when i am in a store is in the basket area you put your stuff and it takes up the whole cart.  So i leave it in the car and carry my son in my baby wrap carrier.  Some can lock onto a shopping cart but not all will some just sit there and some (like mine) dont fit at all.  this is the only problem i have with my carseat other than that it is the best carseat i have ever used.<br>  <br>  edit* i see some have explained the notch on the bottom of the carseat where it attches to the base.  mine does not have this and this is why it can not sit on a shopping cart.  it actually makes it hard to sit in a stoller to. i have tried in in no less than 10 different strollers and it has only fit in one a jeep stroller.  welll they fit the combi stroller, but i dont have one.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I think all carseats that have a base and carrier separate will attach but I'm not 100% sure. I am pretty short (4' 11") so if I put my baby all the way up there, I cant see her lol. I put her in the bottom of the car or turn her carseat sidways and sit it on top of the sides of the cart (does that make sense?). I would go and look at a display if you can and see where the seat actually connects to the base. Good luck!|`|46tTmMT7aa	I found, with my graco snugride, that it didn't always fit perfectly on all the carts. There were certain stores where it leaned back too far, didn't properly latch to the cart. It depends on what store you go to. But, it did lock in perfectly at a couple stores. If it didn't lock in right, I put it in the basket part.|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	They don't lock into the shopping carts...people just set them there. Some car seats are actually too big for a shopping cart, like the one I got (graco safeseat).<br>  <br>  Addition: You don't have to wait to shop until your husband is around to go with you. You can always use a front pack while baby is small. Granted, it will be a little more work, but it's doable.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	Nope they don't lock on, they have like a strap that goes around to "hold" it in. I personally think they're really unsafe. My car seat moves around too much and you can't see over the top of it to know where you're going. If you accidentally bang into something the car seat rocks like mad.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Mine clipped into some and others it just sat on. As long as you are constantly supervising then it is safe to do.

But if she's married and you're willing to let him raise YOUR daughter as his own, that would mean you have no respect for yourself as a MAN. All you have in this world is your dignity and your word. If you call yourself a man then I wouldn't get her pregnant just because she wants a little girl. That would be like saying it's ok for your daughter to not only cheat on her future husband but go around letting this man think he has a baby when he doesn't. If she doesn't want to be with him, which is kind of obvious since she's with you, why don't you both do the adult thing and let them separate before having a daughter. You man up and raise your own kid. If that doesn't sound like something you want to do, then DEFINITELY DON'T GIVE HER A BABY|`|LgZmCt7qaa	Ok  joke is over. You have to be kidding to have typed such an asinine  letter.<br>     First, having a boy or a girl is simply the luck of the draw, just because you have two girls already does not mean you automatically pump out little girls.<br>      Your 41 she is  23, married and the mother, and i use that term loosely of two boys.  I would have thought that with age, namely you, there would be an increase in intellect ,boy was i wrong !<br>     Are you serious about impregnating this  young female and letting some other man raise the child just because she wants a girl,and just what happens if it turns out to be another boy? Does she plan on giving that one up and trying again?<br>        Just so you know in the future, this site is for people with genuine concerns in their life, and i happen to agree with all the previous  answers, especially the one regarding hearing banjo music.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	lol silly troll,this forum is for real questions.|`|cfiXSkE0aa	no! she's married!

If you don't want to be there get a job and drop out, having a baby isnt' going automatically give you an excuse why you can't go to school. I went to school with women who got pregnant while in school or already had a baby and they managed. That's a really pathetic thing to do.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You want to exchange one stressful situation with another? ... Having a child with hardly any education..

Your baby deserves two parents that are together and married b/c they want to be.  If you got pregnant now, your bf would marry you out of obligation.<br>  <br>  And just think, you will have to start working.  You'll need insurance.  It's several thousand dollars to give birth in a hospital.  If you are on your parent's insurance now, you won't be if you quit school.<br>  <br>  You do need to make some changes in your life,  you don't get pregnant.  You'll regret it.  You might not be able to provide a good life for your baby right now.  It will be so much easier to drop out or transfer.<br>  <br>  You might even be suffering from depression.  Talk to your doctor.|`|hb94oOSeaa	that is one of the most ridiculous reasons to have a child that I have heard besides the one about her bf thinking it would be hot that is.<br>  If you are that unhappy in college why not just drop out? Or you could try to figure out what it is that would make you happy? What do you want to do with your life and how do you want to support yourself?<br>  An education is important but an education that you will use for your future is even more important. Maybe you need to change your courses or maybe college just isn't for you, but this is no reason to bring a life into the world.|`|tzPEckiZaa	I'm sorry you're going through this. My freshman year of college, I didn't feel this way, but my boyfriend did. <br>  <br>  He was just at a point in his life, where he didn't see much of a light at the end of the tunnel. He felt that a baby would give us all a breath of fresh air, and provide him with the motivation to do better, and be a better person. <br>  <br>  Looking back on it now, I'm extremely thankful we didn't have a child. It was horrible timing, and we were both still extremely young. I'm 28 now and still can't imagine having a child or where my life would be right now with his child.<br>  <br>  Hang in there, and seek out professional help if you need it. Sometimes it's extremely helpful to talk with someone about your feelings and not just the world wide web.|`|9mQC5Vihaa	That's the single stupidest idea I've ever heard|`|E76r5xSxaa	That's not a good idea. I'm sure there's cheaper, more mature ways to quit school.

G1j3Ja5Iaa	my hubby and i tried for 1 year and 2 months, and we are also young. my 21st bday is today and he is 24...i called the doctor but just like you said..they said that cuz were still so young, they couldnt really do anything but blood tests or whatever..anyway..we tried doing it on certain days and taking ovulation tests and so on, but nothing ever happened..and finally last month, we did it EVERY OTHER DAY from the day i got off my period, to the day before my next expected period..that period never came and im now 7 weeks and 3 days! we didnt always feel like doing it every other day..but we did anyway (we really wanted a baby! lol) and then after each time, i would lay with 2 pillows under my butt for 15 mins..and then get up and get dressed, and go lay/sit on the couch for an additional 30 mins..then i would go to the bathroom to clean up..try doing this and see what happens...good luck and baby dust!!|`|ObbkCX4faa	I would get a second opinion first of all. Secondly, if your periods are so irregular it would make sense that you haven't gotten pregnant so that issue should be addressed. Also, I know you probably don't want to hear this but sometimes it's just not the right time and it will happen when you are ready. I have 2 kids and neither were planned. I also had 2 miscarriages and those pregnancies were the ones that WERE planned. I wish the best and baby dust to you!
lGcpXteaaa	You know, sometimes i really do stay in my pj's all day! I never get time to actually sit and do my hair or makeup. Unless we are going out somewhere through the day and my daughter will let me sit and do it. Luckily my mother is a hairdresser and a nail technician so i get them done quite regularly :)<br>  I didnt shave my legs for *ages* and i did for the 1st time on Friday for a night out with friends. I joked that i will be cold without my hairy legs :)<br>  <br>  But yeah, i look like an rough old bag most days...oh well....|`|KICQQxLxaa	My hair gets highlighted/lowlighted and cut 8-10 weeks.<br>  I get my eyebrows waxed whenever needed.

I pluck my eyebrows now, and that's about once a month. i only stay in my pajamas all day long on rare occasions like today it's both raining and i'm on my 1st day of my period (sorry tmi) so im feeling pretty crappy.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'm not much into doing hair and nails - never was even before I had kids - but I shaved my legs two hours ago.<br>  <br>  Stay in my pajamas all day long?

It gets very cold where I am and they are so comfy!  :-)|`|zhrGiQsKaa	i shave my legs even day in the shower. i get my hair cut or colored or permed usually every 6 months and i don't like to get my nails done so i don't do that unless i am going to a special event.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I have never been a manicure girl; I'm too rough with my hands for them to last!  The best I do is keep them filed neatly and sometimes a coat of clear or super pale polish done at home. <br>  I have naturally curly hair too, but haven't had it cut in a year LOL!  I know really I need to, but since I don't brush it, color it, blow dry or even straighten it...it's very healthy and looks fine. :)<br>  As for hairy legs, I hate that!  I do it every 3 days or so.  My leg hair is not super thick or coarse, so I can even wait longer, but I like having smooth legs!<br>  <br>  I'd say I'm not a PJ mom ALL the time, and especially not in public.  I make it a point to wear a bit of makeup and look put together if I'm out and about!  :)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I shave every couple of days, but less in the winter time. I usually don't stay in my pajamas all day, but might put on sweats if we're not going anywhere. Otherwise it's a warm sweater and cords or something like that. <br>  <br>  I don't get my nails done. No money, and I have never been one to do much to them. I did get my hair cut like a week ago? I think, but it had been several months since, just because of trying to juggle schedules and such. <br>  <br>  I shaved my legs while in labor with my last child LOL so that's one thing I don't let go TOO long!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Got my hair professionally done: the end of August... which was when I had my last hair cut (I want to grow it out so am waiting to cut it)<br>  Did my own hair: 2 weeks ago for a job interview<br>  Got my nails done:.....?

I have a pajama day every now and then - if I'm not leaving the house that day, who cares?. Been about 6 months since my last haircut - it usually stays in a pony tail to avoid getting baby vomit in it. But I do colour it at home every couple months (to hide the greys that suddenly appeared once the kids came along). Getting nails done is just impractical and unnecessary for me, but it was before the kids too. And I shave my legs at least once a week for baby swim class and more often if the weather is warm, but would shave every 2nd day before kids. It's not that I'm lazy, there are just more important things in my life at the moment.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	This is such a cute question! I'm not sure if I qualify as a mom yet, as my girl is due in 2 1/2 weeks. But I'd love to answer. I stay in my PJ's (disability now) unless I leave the house! I shave my legs only on the days of doctor appointments (once a weeks lol)<br>  <br>  I haven't had my hair done since june of last year, I hate gettting my nails done so like 2 years for that one. I do them my self if that counts. <br>  <br>  I can't wait for my little girl. Also Shaving is hard at 37 1/2 weeks pregnant. I can barely see what I'm doing !|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Ahhh before my baby I would get a mani/pedi every month.  There was a place I could walk to from my house where you got both for $14.  (The only thing cheap in LA, btw)...  <br>  <br>  But we moved to a different city and are in a much tighter financial situation since I hadn't been working for 6 months or so.  So the last time I had my nails done was probably 3 months ago and only because I had a wedding to go to.  My hair?  Ha ha that has been 8 months and I need it done again desperately but again that is more do to the financial situation than not having the time.  Shaving my legs?  Honestly...  probably every 2 weeks or so.  I'm blonde and not very hairy so it takes a long time for it to grow back in.|`|caExWxHbaa	well im not  mom but MY MOM hasn't gotten her hair done in 10 weeks, her nails done in a year, and shaved her legs in 10 months! lol|`|uj1A73ZGaa	Last time I had my hair done was a week before I had my twin girls and they are almost 3months old now. I got a Malibu treatment and got my nails painted. Than for Christmas I got my haircut and donated my hair that's the last time I got my hair done.<br>  <br>  I don't get my hair or nails done much. Even though I work at a salon and am a hair stylist. I do my toe nails too they are always painted. <br>  <br>  Some days I will admit that I stay in my pjs all day. That was when my oldest was getting her 2 year molars, had a high fever, and was super cranky and wanted to be held all day.|`|AA11923558	I had my hair highlighted almost 2 months ago ( my roots are showing terribly now), and i never get my nails done. The last time i painted my toenails was in October. I don't shave my legs I epilate them (a machine that pulls out your hair by the roots) and the last time i did that was about a week and a half ago.|`|BQsVPV9Yaa	Its amazing how I really don't have much time for myself. Just yesterday, 17 days after having my baby I shaved my legs and gave myself a pedicure. I want to go tanning so bad and I need to get my eyebrows waxed badly - but can't find the time! Its true that some moms stay i their pajamas all day! You wake up in the morning and hubby has to get ready, so you're taking care of the baby. And if hubby doesn't have time to watch baby before work then you don't get to shower until he's home from work. My schedule is a lot easier than that and I always get ready in the morning - but I know people who have to live that way!! CRAZY!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Hmmmmm......do I have to be honest???  OK, I guess I will be.<br>  <br>  I have gotten my hair cut once since my son was born...almost 2 years ago!  I haven't had it dyed since before I was pregnant, but I'm actally digging my natural color that I hadn't seen in years lol.  I fix my hair maybe twice a month, but most of the time it goes straight into a pony tail.  <br>  <br>  Last time I had my nails done was also before I was pregnant.  I used to always always keep them with a french tip, that I got filled every other Friday at 3:00pm by a my nail lady named Misty (lol...it still remember even my apt time because I had the same one since high school).  I'm looking at my nails right now and they are in bad need of a trim and a file.  And, they have dirt under them because I was playing outside with my son and his new dump truck.<br>  <br>  As for the last time I shaved my legs.  Honestly in the winter when I'm always wearing long pants, I tend to let them get a little scraggly. I actually shaved them last night, but before that it probably been at least 10 days.  But, in the summer I shave them everyday/every other day.  <br>  <br>  The last time I fixed my makeup was actually just a couple of days ago, but before that it'd been ages.  I used to not even leave the house without makeup, but now I find myself all sorts of places with a bare face.  I actually get a little embarrased when I see old friends or aquaintaces and they are looking at me funny becasue its the first time they've seen me without makeup.<br>  <br>  I have to admit that though I am busy as a full time mom/full time college student/full time babysitter for a friend's little girl, I should take better care of myself.  I'm doing all my college online right now, and there are plenty of days that I never get out of my PJs.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My hair got trimmed and relaxed when my son was a month old. Bc my friends who took cosmetology school did it for me.<br>  <br>  Nails.. I haven't had done since way before my son was even conceived. When I had the money to get them done<br>  <br>  Omg lets not even talk about shaving. I try my best to do it but I have to admit i haven't in awhile. Course doesn't really matter I guess bc my husband and I don't even sleep in the same bed sorta. Doesn't like to have sex with me as much either but whatever....I have to agree with other poster. I think the gorilla or Sasquatch would really think I was apart of there family haha! well its not that bad but it was funny.<br>  <br>  <br>  Well I got one of 3 in 1 wet to dry shavers for christmas so maybe that was a hint =)<br>  <br>  Before anyone says eww gross.

Personally I don't stay in pj's all day though.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I got my hair cut 2 weeks ago lol if that counts.<br>  I got my hair done in may of 08'. and i haven had my nails done since beofre i got pregnant,<br>  <br>  I shaved my legs a few days ago,<br>  <br>  ive really let myself go, but whenever i have a chance to get dolled up, i do.<br>  I did for valentines day.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	Nails? Hair?<br>  <br>  Oh those things I never have time to do anymore! lol.. I can't even remember.

The last time I got my legs waxed was 22.5 weeks ago, just before I had my baby, who is 20 weeks old. My hair was cut over 18 weeks ago, which was done just after I had my baby. I have never have ever had my nails done, though I would love to get french tips. My hair is a frizzy mess no matter what cut I have and I don't have time to straighten, so I was thinking about getting a perm, but apparently they are "not In" anymore and are really bad.......must have missed the memo, lol.<br>  <br>  I don't stay in my pj's all day long, I usually have a shower about 11am, just before the lunchtime rush, then take Daughter to kindy.<br>  <br>  I at least pluck my eyebrows, or if I didn't I'm sure that sasquatch would think I was one of his kind with the legs I'm sporting at the moment. I have gorillas bashing at my door wanting to mate with me.

I last got a pedicure 4 months ago.  I last shaved my legs sometime last week. I don't stay in my pj's all day, but I don't dress up/do makeup unless we are going out(RARE).   Now that I have a baby and a 2 year old, I don't have time for myself at all.  Some days I don't even get a shower because I would rather take that 15 minutes to sleep!|`|eChf0G5Iaa	Nails and hair are hard, but SHAVING YOUR LEGS! That is something that is never a prob for me!            I do my own hair and nails anyway!|`|q1b2OrOZaa	Meh. Not often enough, for sure. The artificial tips? Don't mix so well with baby poo, eh?|`|EZQIOIxxaa	I only put "real" clothes on when I'm going out of the house. I stay in my pajamas all day maybe once a week. I haven't washed my hair in a few days but that's because I have a ridiculous amount of hair. I haven't shaved my legs in probably a week. But the pits get it every time I get a chance to shower every other day or so...that's one thing I refuse to let get out of hand!|`|JWvkEN7taa	My mom like did her nails last week, and shaves in shower I guess...|`|Cgrd1CWoaa	my babyshower|`|TuIrAXLkaa	ummm idk its been a long time but hey I have a jerk for a baby daddy|`|TJusfEnlaa	I went to a hairdresser a few days before Xmas and it was sucha  big deal as I had never left my then 7 month old son before and he was siffering major seperation anxiety, I left him with my Mum and she even called me up aftr an hour to say my son was hysterical and to hurry up... *sigh* Haven't been since but desperately need to cos I have blonde hair!<br>  I live in a really hot climate and wear shorts and singlets all the time so I always have to shave my legs, can't get away with that one! I usually do it at night but when baby is asleep. <br>  And as for nails... I don't think being a mummy of a baby and having manicured nails are a good thing!!!!|`|1895464215f4840121d35c5e1750e025aa	Lol ... I don't know the last time I shaved my legs. I think it was for my 6 week checkup with the doc. That was 5 months ago. I keep saying I am going to get my hair cut but have only made it once to get it trimmed. I colored my hair a couple months after my son was born but not since. Once spring gets here I am sure I will get back into a regular schedule for everything.|`|8c1543nUaa	Some moms just don't find the time or don't think it's worth it to get "ready" for the day. Some days, I can't blame them. I'd say 6 out of 7 days, I do my hair. I shave my legs as often as I used to (when I feel like it!). I always hated having my nails done, so it's been awhile for that. :)|`|iTXnHiwTaa	Winter here so I don't care to shave but its such a pain to shave if i wait longer than 2 weeks.<br>  I have twins and let me tell you, for the first few months it was sweat pants, ponytail and deodorant. NO SHOWERS for 2-3 days at a time... man that brings me back.<br>  I'm slowly getting better...I can shower now but nails and hair and shaving? loooong way off for me.

6lSbmXunaa	Thank you! People at school ask everyone if they're going to wait (I seriously don't know what's going through their heads but this is what the 15 year olds at my school wonder about apparently) and I'm one of the only people who say that I'm absolutely going to wait. And it surprises people that I want to wait. Which is sad.  <br>  <br>  Like the first guy said, sex is for reproduction. And yes, it can be pleasurable, but it's even better when you're with someone you love and actually care for. Not just fooling around because you're horny or something.<br>  <br>  And a few people asked me, "Well, what if they're really bad at sex and you hate it. Then you're stuck being married to them."  And that is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.  You don't marry for "good sex." You marry because you love that person.<br>  <br>  Stick to your morals, you've got it right.<br>  <br>  God bless you!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Liberals are taking over, lol.<br>  <br>  It's becuase people don't believe in god and think abortions are right and think condoms are the answer to everything and you get it.<br>  <br>  Edit: What a lot of people don't get is that the biology of sex was desinged for one thing, and that was for making babies. Not for a teenager to fool about with.<br>  <br>  Cheyenne Nicole: Can't take a joke? Wow, what a mature person. Even the asker agrees that it's funny.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Ah, I hate that.  People think it's wrong to wait until marriage because you "have to test the car before you buy it" which makes them look shallow and stupid.|`|t0mb150gaa	there is nothing wrong with waiting till your married..teens should show more self control and better morals and values then they do in today's society. <br>  But i also think that if you are out of school(over 18) and have a plan for your life then having sex before your married should not be frowned upon as long as there is love then no one has the right to judge.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	you are the one with the right idea! I personally believe in waiting until you are at least an adult in an serious adult relationship..(and by adult I mean over 21) if not marriage. Good girl!! Keep up the good work and steer your own course.|`|MCeh0uIaaa	cause people are dumb. they have their own opinions & people think that they should thumb down when they disagree when they should really use that power to thumb down people who are INACCURATE.|`|ZX2so3twaa	some people just don't wanna wait.|`|2ZXh00C5aa	Height question guru is a certified douche bag. <br>  <br>  <br>  Nothing is wrong with saving yourself until marriage but some believe that when you espouse those ideas in response to a question, you have a sort of "holier than thou" attitude.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why they would react that way, but that's how they feel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Height Question Guru: I can take a joke; you just aren't very skilled in the art of humor.

I don't believe in god, and I don't necessarily think that the only time sex is right is if you are married.  If you are in a healthy, loving relationship, if you are emotionally and financially ready to support a child, and you feel comfortable discussing sex with your partner, then you are ready.  Sex makes babies, so you better be ready for one if you are having sex.  It's almost as if my fellow teenagers don't care about the consequences- having sex all the time, and all these teen pregnancies!  Close your legs, people.|`|mAO3JtPkaa	My husband and I were talking about this same thing a few days ago, we just can't believe how sex means nothing anymore, that young girls, 12-13 years old hand it out like you would life savers candy or a piece if gum! My son (25) won't get married, because every woman his age has a kid or two, and he doesn't want to raise someone else's kids, or have someone else raise HIS kids. He said there are NO young women who want to settle down and be monogamous, that they ALL come from multiple relationships now. Its sad how there is no morality or values anymore.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	You're right. A lot of people don't see the point of waiting because they have fallen head over hills in love and need to do it. It's their choice. I mean, I've got nothing wrong with it, but I do believe that if you are IN LOVE, meaning an adult age to have sex is alright. Underage sex is so uneducated. I'm a virgin, I'm not afraid to admit it. But I know I want to wait to lose it to the right person, and this will be my present to them to show how much I really do love them. :)|`|ioGCMeAeaa	i would totally agree with you, ignore the thumbs down, you are right if you just wait til your married you won't have any regrets then and it would be safer, just ignore the stupid things and the thumbs down, stick to what you think is right. :)|`|giyyEv3Aaa	In my opinion, sex brings you closer to your boyfriend/girlfriend, that's just how I go cause it gets me closer to my girlfriend.

eytlIKITaa	You shouldn't be fertile at all, but it depends on when you ovulate...|`|QSodlfMraa	not that high, and i do not know anyone who got pregnant on the first days of their period.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	You are not fertile at all. When you are on your period your womb lining is being shed because the egg that your ovary released approx 14 days before wasn't fertilised. <br>  <br>  Its virtually impossible to get pregnant on your period if its a true period and not a "withdrawal bleed" from the pill etc|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	Not very but the possibility of getting pregnant is still there. You are most fertile in the two weeks after your period. Hope that helps.|`|LQnKhiVMaa	i fell pregnant 2 days before my period came (which came as normal but was extremely light, and was more like old blood). i dont think its really common, but happens to a fair amount of women x x
H0sJU68Oaa	i am 16 w 5 D with my first pregnancy & I felt my baby move for the first time a few days ago. It was only slight movements & could of been easily over looked.

It sounds promising :) GL X.|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	It could be that your mind is just playing tricks on you and has made your body fake pregnancy symptoms. Wait a few days before testing regardless, as the earliest test say they cannot detect until 10 dpo. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and lots of baby dust! I hope this is your month!|`|txSiQc7Waa	With so many of us TTCers, we can make more out of symptoms than what are really there. A lot of pregnancy symptoms are exactly the same as AF.... your best bet would be to wait until the day af is due and if she's a no-show, test. I wish you lots of luck and tons of baby dust!|`|Dvnk504Haa	I tricked my body into thinking it was preg too made me very upset the day AF arrived. The only way to know is to test! good luck!
hb94oOSeaa	Sit down take a deep breath then go to your local pharmacy and get yourself plan B.<br>  I would then make yourself a gyno appointment and talk this over with your doctor. You may want to do some testing to be on the safe side (not sure how soon you should/could do them)|`|wJcpjDLUaa	If it's a blur, definitely take it.  It isn't worth the worry.  Just go buy it, or if you aren't 18, get someone else to buy it for you.  Everything will be fine.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	I don't understand what advice you need.  Go get the pill and take it, its not like it will hurt you if you didn't do it and take the pill anyways.  If you are worried about STD's make an appointment with your Dr. and get tested for them.

I just found out I am pregnant on Tuesday and I've had cramping, back pain, peeing all the time and light headedness.  My friend however never had a reason to think she was pregnant.  It just all depends on the person and how their body reacts to the hormones.  But there are times I dont feel pregnant...I feel like maybe my period is sue instead, but nothing comes and I still test positive.  so hang in there.  I think once we get to hear the heart beat and see our little one on the ultrasound screen it might finally kick in.  good luck.|`|4cehW3S9aa	I am 14w 2d pregnant and I don't feel pregnant at all.  Noone can tell I am pregnant, and I am slender, but I notice because no clothes fit me anymore.  I have seen my baby on an internal ultrasound twice so that helped a little bit.  I am hoping in a couple weeks I will feel the baby move.  On top of that, I never had morning sickness just tender breasts and frequent urination.
b3tEwY9vaa	Whenever your little heart desires. Preferably after 2 weeks.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	to be safe wait 3 weeks .. good luck|`|9zwSclnLaa	3-4 weeks after unprotected sex is the best time.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	Its harder to get pregnant when you do not have a regular period.

hIzQyflqaa	i dont think she needs to be having milk that often at her age from what i remember but if she needs it that often let her have it, your breasts will supply on demand and they are in tune with baby so maybe try spreading it out longer and then pumping inbetween! some peoples milk just goes and it cant be helped, mine started to run out when my son was 4 months and he wasnt getting enough so i had to switch him to powdered milk! i was disappointed but i am glad i bf for those 4 months!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I'd say your milk is just adjusting to her feeding schedule. It's great that she sleeps so much, and otherwise seems satisfied. Pumping may not produce much because it's not the same as a baby nursing, so don't worry. It sounds like as long as she's filling diapers regularly and eating well, you're doing everything right. If you want to pump to have some extra just in case, you can try Fenugreek supplements. I also found that it was easier for me to get my letdown stimulated by using nipple stimulation.|`|78852a4f1042102a61d00f9918f0a810aa	It took me a week before I got a good supply at pumping. My son went every 3 hours too.<br>  I did it like this. Always pumped (say 8 to 10 min each side) as soon as I woke up in the morning and than afterwards 1 hour or so later nursed my son.<br>  Your breasts over the course of like 4 to 5 days will get the message and you will wake up with engorged breasts. I had 4 ounces each side once because my son was also sleeping a bit longer that day. Make sure you keep on pumping though even though there is not much coming out, because its the stimulations that will make your breast know that you need more milk.<br>  <br>  Also the breast is used to your babies sucking. I had trouble with the pump at first, but I move it around and try to find different angles and the milk comes out fast in different angles...give it a try but dont give up...

c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	Stress can definitely screw up a cycle that's for sure. I know with a little one running around being tired and stressed is pretty much normal, but try having a couple of hours just to relax. No cleaning, cooking, feeding...Have hubby do it! Just relax and unwind. I know it sounds like a stretch, but you can even do it before bed, just lie back and watch TV or something, something mindless to clear your head. <br>  <br>  In my experience, BC screwed me up, but I also had a D&C before taking it as well as hormone problems. So, I can't attribute anything really to JUST the BC..
hitgP4Hoaa	O god reading about you brings back all my labor lol i had back labor all the way. i just getting really bad contractions on my back every 3 seconds but it was on my lower back, but the only thing is my stomach never got tight thought any of it. but it does sound like slow labor because i was like that for a couple of weeks because my water was leaking. i was the same nothing would kill the pain so hun sounds like your little baba could be here very soon. if you want to no any more on back labor you can give me an email no problem at all,<br>  <br>  good luck <br>  <br>  xx|`|82BSdiyCaa	Yes, back labor has the same type of contractions, it's just that the pain and pressure tends to radiate to or from your back. The pelvic pressure is probably from the baby in a low position. It sounds like you are definitely in early labor, but that can last for days. I would wait until your contractions are consistent and at least 10 min apart before going to the hospital.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it sounds like it will be soon!!

You've got to judge the situation yourself because you know your family and we don't. <br>  <br>  I had small animals when I was about that age and I was responsible enough to make sure the lid was kept on the cage so they wouldn't get out. You should always check the cage after it's been opened to make sure it's closed, no matter where the snake is kept. <br>  <br>  I would most likely let my son if we were in the same situation. <br>  What are your concerns about it?|`|yFYFSjwcaa	It depends on him<br>  <br>  If he smart enough to keep a eye on it at all times ok<br>  <br>  But he is doesn't pay attention and doesn't remember to lock the snakes cage you'll have a problem.|`|lXE75yQjaa	I would..but then again, I live in a zoo here. My girls have had room pets virtually all their lives. Never a snake...but I guess it wouldn't bother me a bit, if the child has shown responsibility already. <br>  Of course still check on it, etc. as you can't expect a child that young to be perfect in remembering to care for it.<br>  Not sure why all the negativity..are they poisonous or something? To me, this would be no biggie.<br>  <~~currently lives with a ferret and a guinea pig who are my kiddos room pets|`|vAF4wgVDaa	Sure, Corn snakes are very easy to take care of and a very friendly snake if I might add. The only thing that I would be worried about would be if the snake escaped. They are very smart and sneaky  so I would double check the cage every night to make sure that the lid is closed properly. I would also stress the importance of keeping the cage closed, to your son.<br>   If the snake were to get out it would be very hard to find. Also make sure the snake is getting enough heat, in the day and night. If you son has an extremely cold room or something I would not suggest it but if not then it should be ok.|`|D0M2AXTGaa	Im kind of torn on this one, on one hand, corn snakes are not venomous, and if he is responsible and handles it correctly and doesn't torment it (which im sure he doesn't) then I would say ya. <br>  <br>  But then the mother in me comes out, and says that even if he does those things, the snake could still bite him, which again, it being a non-venomous and very small snake isn't going to be that bad. <br>  <br>  I think overall I would let my sons keep it in their room. As long as he knows what he's doing and is responsible and doesn't let the snake loose or anything. Maybe if your worried, you could let him keep it in his room, but only play/hold it with parental supervision.|`|H6QkoukSaa	Some people are idiots, lol<br>  <br>  If it were some fish nobody would have a problem, just because it is a snake, look out it will bite your face off or eat you while you sleep.<br>  <br>  I let my kids have fish in their rooms, of course I do most of the care and maintenance because of their ages. My cat sleeps where ever he chooses, kids rooms included.<br>  <br>   I think if he wants the snake in his room it shouldn't be a problem if you don't care. The only issue is if his room is messy and the snake gets out. Better the snake be confined to one messy room then have access to the whole house where he could get lost or hurt. The more time that the snake spends with him the better bond they will have anyway.<br>  <br>  I don't even think it should be an issue.|`|5eSSAT69aa	No, because a long, slithering thing in the bedroom might turn him gay. However, a nice gerbil in the bedroom is a wonderful pet ;P|`|g2JlIuRcaa	should a 23 year old man be allowed to keep a pet thai woman in his bedroom??|`|miTZ0bb1aa	sure why not|`|UZhxK9cMaa	hell no man 7 years old?????????? wow|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I wouldn't - because I don't think a seven year old is responsible enough to be the one who has to check that the pet is fine (I don't know a great deal about snakes, but they need special heat lamps and so on I think), and because unless it was somewhere that I'd see it every morning, I'd be worried that I wouldn't always remember.<br>  <br>  Swings and roundabouts here. If your seven year old is remotely responsible, you won't be in his room every morning, he'll be getting himself out of bed and dressed, so you won't be seeing the snake. If he isn't responsible enough for that, he's not responsible enough to care for an animal.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	why not?
x2GQ8n6Oaa	You may find that your breasts get tender in the next few weeks, mine didn't start until I was about 8 weeks, but as other answerers have said, everyone is different and we don't all experience the same symptoms - it's all due to the hormonal changes, don't worry - just take care of yourself and your baby!|`|QSodlfMraa	girl i did not have any sore boobs and i do not want to know why yes it is ok cause if it was not my doctor would have told me cause i am now 22 weeks and i have been going to the doctor since 7 weeks|`|K6rZmVmAaa	I didn't with my first. Don't worry bout it x|`|YxFDiEaCaa	I have two children and each time i was pregnant i did not have sore boobs, everyone is different. We are lucky!|`|ZXsEjd83aa	you're fine.. u and another woman dont have the same body, so the symptoms will be different, but if u want to make sure..u can always go to ur doctor the professional|`|NOz2FRlraa	You're fine. Some people get sore boobs, some people don't...everyone's different.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	Yes, it is defenatly ok.  I am pregnant with my 2nd child and my boobs didn't get sore until about 8/9 wks.  But even then don't be expecting it sweetie.  lol.  Feel lucky and glad if it doesn't happen.  lol.  With my first child, they didn't get sore at all.  EVERYONE is different, EVERY child is different, and EVERY PREGNANCY is different!|`|gEfvPqQeaa	Hi emmab. I'm also coming 6weeks pregnant. You will eventually get them lol.

Take it easy.. It will all come in time|`|RSbbLs5saa	lol you're ok! everyones pregnancy symptoms are different! i wouldnt worry about it too much!
rCjRRDF5aa	You should still take it on day 11. It's very unlikely that one extra day of your period would change when you ovulate.
cfkgnbCNaa	nah, it's just their first.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, you didn't really go into any detail about what you were blamed for. It doesn't sound like you were blamed for anything, really. No matter what the parent's age, first babies cause all sorts of anxiety and paranoia. Are they eating enough? Too much? Are they pooping enough? Are they sleeping enough? Are they sick? Why are they crying? On and on and on. Just be patient and if you are bothered by the conversation bring it up with them. You don't have to be accusatory, just say, "I was really worried when you called me so frantic the other night. I just wanted you to know that I would never give the baby anything or take him anywhere that you didn't approve of beforehand." First time parents are neurotic, no matter how much time they've spent around babies before having their own. To actually answer your question though, yes people can blame you for anything they want to without evidence or proof. They could blame you for starting WWII but it wouldn't go anywhere. Just do your job and keep the lines of communication open.|`|AA10628838	I have been nanny for a family for 10 years who were 41 when they had their first son. They now have two boys 10 and 8. The dad was really very paranoid about his little baby boy not being taken care off more so than the mom. Don't just walk off your job like that.  Instead try to reassure your family about what is being done for their son. The best thing to do is to document what and how much he is being fed and drinks every hour and diaper changes. Make notes of any changes in bowel movements, skin condition, if the baby feels cool or hot, what he likes and doesn't when he is fed. This will also help if the baby for no reason begins to feel  ill or fussy as sometimes it can be food related or the child is becoming ill. Document everything you do with the baby in the way of activities, plus the naps. You can actually track things on the documentations that help to identify problem areas that you can take responsibility for and ask for interaction and help from them to change foods the baby is eating and daily routines. Suggestions and feedback to the parents will make you a better caregiver and will show them you are a caring on hands nanny. Also read as much as you can about childcare and take continuing education courses when possible.<br>  <br>  This may sound like a lot of responsibility because it is. It can also help you avoid problems that could arise and answer problems that come up. If you cannot deal with the questions they will ask you, then maybe you need to start looking for another line of work.|`|jYPeis3Saa	people can accuse others of whatever they want. proof or not. people are stupid.<br>  <br>  id start looking for a new job if i were you, you dont know what else might happen|`|j6yVurY3aa	Trust your gut....If you feel like some thing is not right here, get out now!|`|TYT5vQA4aa	No you shouldn't jus quit, there is no substantial reason to. There is nothing to be alarmed about in the parents behavior. You may be jumping to conlusions a bit. As you said this IS their first child and them wanting to know what is happening with the baby is normal especially if it has to do with eating. The baby not eating could be a serious sign of something. You shuld know this as a nanny! When a baby is born it is important to watch the baby's habits because small things could turn into big things. But in all it seems that the Father is simply concerned and yes maybe neurotic but at least there is a Mother that is level headed enought to see the true problem. You, on the other hand, shouldn't be so quick to jump ship simply over one phone call of concern. When there are new parents inolve a certain trust has to be developed with a nanny. Maybe these parents are still finding it with you, so don't be confrontational or on the verge of quitting if you trully love what you do. Be a nanny and serve to the best of your capabilities. This includes a little humility.|`|PIfaJRuoaa	I was a nanny for 3 families for 6 years before having my own child.  I've never had any incidents with the families where they've accused me of anything or gotten upset with me.  I suppose it all depends on the family you work for, but my suggestion is, work for a family that you can get along with.  It makes work more enjoyable and worthwhile.|`|orLUNzrraa	I can only imagine what it will be like for you the first time the baby falls down and skins his knee or cuts his lip while he's under your care.  Some people just don't understand that occasionally babies won't eat, they fall down sometimes, and, sometimes, they just fuss for no reason that a caregiver can reason out.  Yes, I'd run!|`|rFXt8ygGaa	ya i would run cause its sounds like any wee thing they r goin to be on ur case and make u feel bad
fOzV0oHvaa	Yes it is. I don't think rape counts as an excuse for an abortion either. Why should a child have to pay for it's father's crime?|`|PZYOTy2Haa	I think it depends on the situation eg would you want to keep a rapists baby???<br>  personally i wouldn't really want to get one only if i had to, but its a personal choice and too many people judge!!|`|S5GP2nlUaa	It depends on the situation. If it's for medical reasons then no. If its used as a form of birth control then yes.|`|YLXpwqceaa	Absolutely!!!!|`|PJBjllsVaa	yes|`|oep2L50Baa	yes i really do|`|VS8mactUaa	Well think about it , besides extreme circumstances rape and such, abortion is avoidable if people just take responsibility and keep it safe, and for those that are absent minded enough to not get a pill or a condom there is adoption. The pill or a pack of condoms costs a lot less then an abortion. Its avoidable and its up to the people that dont want children to have a brain,|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Yes...I'm not for it, but I'm not against it either.|`|AA11724307	I just found out I am pregnant less then a week ago and already I love and cherish this life more then my own.  I couldnt imagine ever ending it.  How anyone could....I have no idea.  I think if you created it then you take responsibility for it.  If you dont want a child then you simply dont have sex.  Abortion is irrespoisible.<br>  <br>  edit:  wow...I really love this Simone persons attitude and how she thinks men arent effected by abortion.  So if a girl gets pregnant and the guy wants to keep the baby and the girl think its her body and her choice and aborts...that has no effect on him?  A guy can't have an opinion on abortion yet that child is 50% of him?  Thats a very ignorant way of thinking.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	no i don't think its murder im pro-choice. (btw as a guy i don;t really think you should be asking this at all you would never have to go through it, so really.)<br>  <br>  though i DO think this question is REALLY annoying! and im really sick of hearing it! if someone wants to ask about abortion fine w/e but asking our opinion its just plan stupid! its not needed. none of us want to think about it!|`|4cehW3S9aa	It is murder and only selfish human being do it.<br>  <br>  It is different if the mothers life is in danger by going on with the pregnancy.  Otherwise very very very selfish and should have thought before having sex.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	Yes,I do except in cases of incest or rape.I didn't but then I watched this and it changed my mind.<br>  <a href="http://www.abortionno.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.abortionno.org</a>
q0JTN9QAaa	That person is crazy the safest place is back middle second safest is driver seat, third safes is driver rear, fourth  is passanger and 5th is passanger front/the least safest of all places via AAA.  <br>  <br>  Since your hood is angled up it pushes things above the carseat in the rear and into the roof.  If it comes at a down angle it hits front seat,  Anything you hit coming throw and making it into the back seat are  much more unlikley than a side inpact to either side.<br>  <br>  Of course anything can happen the law of chance says that will happen to someone but the Vegas odds say that is the safest place.<br>  <br>  Percentage wise your child is much more likley to die at every seat other than that one.|`|fa544eab8476aa2f650496936aec45ccaa	My uncle is a police officer and recommends that a child in any car seat be place in the center of the backseat.|`|sOTRIqLCaa	the center backseat. farthest from windows. passenger seat is most dangerous

Since your a 0 now go out and by a size 1 or 3. wear a belt thats not to tight and a longer shirt. No one will ever know they are not maternity pants. Or keep your pants and wear them below your baby belly. Congrats.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	Being that small and pregnant it is going to be hard to find maternity pants for that size at first!  If your regular pants are hurting while buttoned a good trick I seen in magazines were to leave them unbottoned...and use a stretch hair tie and loop it through the button whole and then connect it to the button.  Another thing to do during the first few months or until you get big enough to fit maternity would be to just buy regular pants in bigger sizes!  Good luck...<br>  <br>  oh...and always look for a motherhood maternity store, if anyone has it they would!|`|71e15ac317ae5351e487d5c38939daabaa	Wish I was a size zero! <br>  Anyway, I agree that there isn't much of a selection.

I had gone to Bed Bath and Beyond first and found a few cute bed sets but they were way too expensive for me personally. <br>  <br>  Just think of the stores in your area (walmart, target, pier 1, bed bath and beyond, etc.) and then go to their websites.|`|W7q3KGvfaa	Pottery Barn has some really cute comforters and stuff. if price isnt an issue, then check out their website. hope this helped:) good luck.|`|AA10120592	walmart.com <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5291725" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>  when you said light purple walls this comforter popped in my head. the whole set is beautiful. <br>  target.com also has some pretty ones, but i can't quite remember any of them.|`|FpwRrOwxaa	You could always go to Walmart.

YI31TqNNaa	when my baby dropped, it was all at once, so it did hurt. as far as the discharge, your body is constantly changing over these months, so dont be concerned about that. it is completely normal. ur doc can tell u for sure if your baby dropped, but if i remember correctly, mine dropped at about 35 weeks.|`|IMJ9hNrLaa	Its all normal. If your worried you should ask your Dr. <br>  <br>  <br>  If she's dropped that means she's getting ready to be here!|`|BnpEoMD4aa	whoa. i'm 35w3d and all this exact same stuff is going on with me. i mean... exactly. haha. so hopefully it's okay. the only thing is that i can't necessarily tell that her position has changed, but i feel a lot more pressure in the vaginal area... sometimes even sharp pain. i think it's all just part of the ending point of pregnancy. it just gets really uncomfortable and awkward. we will get through! :)
fcN64i5Faa	When you have clear discharge, it might be the left over sperm from the last time you had sex, still inside of you or it might be your vagina self cleaning itself. We women can do that, if you didn't know.|`|hmOidFp3aa	I love how only one of those answers made sense! She wants a baby, she wants to know when to have sex! Dont tell her to wear a condom, know what you are answering before you do!<br>  <br>  read my last answer, it will be the same! Good luck and I hope we are both pregnant this month!?!|`|sbeoF50gaa	That's what the Dr. told me! That discharge means I'm ovulating. She said it should be clear or even a little white. :) oh yea she also said it will be like mucus, and sticky|`|RR4oRK4Paa	YES.. you are ovulating. Its string, gooey, and slippery. Its OK. No sex tonight.. find other ways/ methods to have fun tonight or just use a condom
ztzEloj5aa	it hurts a little. they freeze it i want to say 2 times to get rid of the top layer of skin cells.<br>  i had it done about 7 years ago<br>  after you will shed dead skin cells and its messy and wet- i wanted to hold a bucket between my legs - its worse then your period. <br>  and its watery discharge - kinda pink in color. <br>  you will have to wait probably 3 weeks to have sex <br>  and yes you can still have kids|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i have never herd of this.<br>  i have heard of people having a termination and getting the cervix numbed so they dont feel pain

yOy5OpqFaa	Oh hun don't be worried at all! I have one too and I am 22 weeks and can never find my babies heartbeat either =/. I can hear him kicking all crazy with it and I can hear my heartbeat but not his. It didn't work with my daughter either till I was like 35 weeks pregnant not a very good thing to buy in my opinion!|`|AA11724307	I heard one of the worst things you can do is buy one of those things.  First off you arent trained to use it and so finding the heartbeat can be very difficult.  Also some people pick up their own and mistake if for the babies heart eating very slowly.  It only causes panic and worry.  Put it away and leave it to the people who know what they are doing.|`|M2VneBW3aa	professionals go to school to do learn how to do this, so it would be very hard for a normal person to try and do it.<br>  <br>  so dont worry about it(:|`|G1j3Ja5Iaa	you shouldnt worry. these things are NOT recommended for a reason..most people have this problem..if your really worried..call your doctor for another scan..but im sure your fine...|`|YGSZgJuVaa	The home dopplers are not as good as the ones your midwife uses. I had the same problem. I couldnt hear one either. Dont worry. The baby may be lying funny. If you are ever concerned, phone the midwife. My advise is not to rely on these home dopplers. You will just worry yourself.|`|mFQydvncaa	ALRIGHTY, CALM DOWN, THOSE HEART MONITERS HARDLY WORK AND THEY CANT BE RELIED ON UNTIL THE THIRD TRIMESTER. THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD HERE IS A LOUD STATIC TAP SOUND THAT WOULD BE BABY KICKS, BUT THE BABY IS TO SMALL AND MOVES WAY TO MUCH TO PICK IT UP ON THOSE MONITERS. I FREAKED OUT MY DOCTOR TOLD ME AND I READ ONLINE THE SAME, THEY ARNT FOR EARLY PREGNANCY!<br>  <br>  SO DONT STRESS ITS BAD FOR BABY! GOODLUCK AND CONGRATS|`|LgBwO3eGaa	those things are a waste of money, i couldn't even hear my sons heartbeat the week before i had him.  i carried until 39 weeks.  they are crap and such a scam.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think this is the primary reason why some suggest you don't buy one of those at home monitors - because if you can't find the heartbeat, you get really freaked out. Are you feeling movement yet? I know it stinks to wait until you really "feel" pregnant, but once you feel movement it should put your mind more at ease. You could keep trying as you get further along - but you might just be causing yourself more stress than needed when everything is okay.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	I understand you, If you don't feel right then go to E.R. to check utrlasound on your stomach and would see baby's heart.
AI2VoFP4aa	butt up is definitely a good thing but that doesn't mean he will stay that way. babies have a Habit of turning when its inconvenient and the only thing you can do is hope they turn back before you go into labor or they run out of room to turn in. im 38 wks and my little girl had turned breech at my last apt. but even when you're feeling them through your stomach theres no real way to know that that's exactly what you're feeling without a dr or an ultrasound telling you so.
HPRlEWu1aa	its all up to u .. none of us know and can tell u not to do something or do something ... if u think u could be ready for this and u think u could picture ur self being attached to ur bf for the rest of ur life, bc u will be weather u stay together or not then go for it . can u picture urself taking care or a little baby that u and ur bf created? bc its a wonderful thing. i cant even explain how much love we have for my belly right now lol, and it brought us even closer then we were b4  .. my mom had mewhen she was 20 .. her life turned out pretty awesome .. im 23 and pregnant, i cant wait. my hubby and i have been together for 6 years, talked about it for every and now we deceide to go thru with it|`|hb94oOSeaa	Wow! This is not a reason to get pregnant. Having a baby should be about having and raising a baby not that your bf thinks it would be "Hot"<br>  If you two are serious enough to consider having a child why wouldn't you first move the relationship into a more serious mode first? Why not get married or move in with each other and see how that goes for a bit and then plan a baby.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	Tell him, if you really want to do this, let's get married and do it the right way. Of course people have the urge to have babies, that's normal. But don't jump into parenthood without a good foundation beneath the three of you, or it could all fall apart and be miserable, especially for the child. I want to repeat that, it's so important: Especially for the child.|`|RPPrfphqaa	if your convincing yourself you dont want a baby..maybe he's not the right one to have one with or maybe you know yourself your not ready for a baby.<br>  guys have all sorts of weird fetishes and fantasies...i've been with my boyfriend for 4 years and he's in love with my feet LOL.<br>  its just a guy thing.<br>  like how some girls think arms are sexy or abs....or someone's lips.<br>  guys have a more advanced obsession and they actually act on a lot of things.|`|Pt40dTBwaa	This may be out of left field, but you may want to consider inflation.  There is a small fetish movement of women who inflate their bellies with air or water to achieve the pregnant look.  Usually this is done with an aquarium pump inserted through the rectum and the intestines are filled with water or air.  If this is a sexual fetish for your boy and not a true desire to have a child this may be the answer for both of you.  If done right, inflation can be harmless and achieve a very convincing look.  There are examples of this on you tube if you are looking for more info.|`|6zPCQ7rPaa	well honestly if those were his exact words, i wouldn't be too eager.the statement itself is immature in two ways. it's wording and it's selfishness. once the pregnancy is over then what. you all stretched out and the fantasy is way over.really think about it.|`|xrA4DxRLaa	Buy one of those things that make you look pregnant, but you're able to take it off. I wouldn't get pregnant just for that, no offense. lol|`|DD9YTs5naa	maybe you should ask him seriously about it|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	"Preggo Fantasy"... In other words,good in theory,not so good in reality.|`|cfdooGylaa	If he's 25 and he said it that way, you two really shouldn't be having children together.
Yn6pM2Xyaa	in 15 days late on a 32 day cycle and have only got BFN's too!  went to my doctor on friday and she felt that i could be pregnant even with bfn's so she ordered a bloodtest and I'll know whats going on by about wednesday.  I definitely have things that can totally be attributed to pregnancy BUT your brain can go crazy when youre ttc babies!  I'd book in an appointment with a doctor, insist on a blood test if they want to rely on just a pee test (been hearing people are having a hard time getting blood tests ordered?!) and then sit on your hands waiting for results!  *baby dust for us both*  best of luck to you!|`|YLXpwqceaa	Is there another reason you could be late? Stress maybe.<br>  <br>  But that doesn't explain the symptoms!<br>  <br>  I suggest another test tomorrow or even waiting a few days....always use FMU!<br>  <br>  If nothing, see your dr because something could be the cause of it.|`|oHNrktxTaa	I know as frustrating this may be. The only thing to give you back to ease your mind is to call your  OBGYN & make an appointment to have blood work done. This will be the most accurate answer.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the BEST!<br>  BABY DUST|`|S5GP2nlUaa	Stop thinking about it, you could be tricking your body into thinking you are pregnant. Either have a blood test done or wait another month and see what happens|`|FeYTPqd1aa	I don't really have an answer, but I can tell you that I experienced that same thing this past cycle.  I wasn't as late as you, but I was five days late with all of the symptoms you had.  I'm never late, so even five days late was a big deal for me.  I got 3 BFN's then my period came after 6 days late.  I know exactly how you feel...so sure it was going to be BFP then so confused and frustrated when a BFN shows up.  <br>  <br>  Two weeks is a long time to be late, though.  I know they say that some women don't ever get positive HPT's, maybe you're one of them.  Or, maybe you ovulated later than you thought?  <br>  <br>  I really hope you get your BFP - Good Luck!|`|txSiQc7Waa	I have a friend that didn't register on htp until she was 8+ weeks along. So definitely make an appt with your dr. to get a blood test! I'm routing for you! (our symptoms are so similar hehe) GOOD LUCK!<br>  <br>  :::::::::::::::BABY DUST COMING YOUR WAY!:::::::::::::::::|`|rCjRRDF5aa	Well if you didn't use your first morning urine, then the hormone may not be built up enough to come up positive on the test.|`|Dvnk504Haa	get a blood test then you will know for sure|`|WdvLcYaVaa	You probably are not pregnant. A test would almost definitely show up by now. You need to go to the doctor to see why your periods are irregular. Good luck!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, it could actually be that you aren't pregnant and just skipped a month due to stress, new work-out routine, other reasons. Or, you could be one those "lucky" women who don't have enough HCG in your urine for an HPT to work. Make an appointment with your doctor for a blood test that will tell you for sure. If you are pregnant the doc can tell you or if you aren't maybe they can shed some light on the missed period and other symptoms. You could also wait a couple days and retest with a different brand. I'm going through a similar thing myself, I've never been late in my life and now am four days late and got neg result three days ago.
miOor5SRaa	If you are irregular & ttc like me you should buy First Response Daily Ovulation test! It helps detect your LH surge which happens 24-48 hrs. before you ovulate. It will help you track your ovulation. The cramps could be ovulation, i get VERY crampy when i ovulate! Hope I could help ~*~*~* BABY DUST *~*~*~|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	Cramps could mean a million things. It may be that sex was too rough and maybe irritated your cervix a little.|`|hIzQyflqaa	try remember when you had your last period! what did you do when you had it? then find out from there if u are due on again or if its something else!|`|Dvnk504Haa	Get the regulation problem fixed or you may be trying a long long time. I have very irregular period so now im on provera and clomid helps heaps with the timing of things. Cramping at the later end of a cycle can be AF aproaching....or that ovulation is about to occur|`|NkGTSqBdaa	Cramps may not mean that your are pregnant and it is very early to tell.

KOwzDLPdaa	I wanted to be pregnant so badly I spent over a hundred dollars on tests! I actually tested everyday from 5 days before my period was due right up until I got a positive test the day after my period was due. Sometimes I even did more than one test a day. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend that method unless you have the money to waste and are very impatient though LOL!!!|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	I did about 4. I had missed my period and we had been TTC. I finally got a positive 5 days after my missed period.|`|AA11724307	I took mine 2 days after my missed period and got a positive right away.|`|mL07bInfaa	I waited until 4 days after my missed period, and only had to take one test, thank goodness since they are so expensive!  It did go positive on the first try...I think the key to getting a good result is waiting until a few days after you miss your period, it is more accurate then...good luck!|`|dGBrlJvgaa	I took one at 3 weeks and it was negative. Then took one a week later and it was positive.|`|Wscsgyd5aa	Take the test a few days after you miss your period.

You can take a test 5 days after a missed period.|`|GUUgeptjaa	With this one I was 3 weeks and I got a faint positive in the morning and a negative in the afternoon and then I waited one more week and I got strong positives throughout the day
8VlDuMFOaa	This should of course be a decision that you and your partner decide, not what others think.<br>  <br>  In my opinion no. There is absolutely no need to put a baby or even a young child through such excruciating pain. It is totally unnecessary and in my opinion a barbaric practice that is out dated and should not be allowed in this day and age unless for medical reasons with the advice of a doctor.<br>  For those that say its cleaner, and less likely to get an infection - my thoughts on that are if you teach him how to clean himself properly, you wont have any trouble.<br>  Like I said, this is just an opinion. I too have a little boy, and for a brief moment "considered" having this done. At the end of the day, I couldn't bare the thought of putting my own flesh and blood through this procedure - and after doing some research and actually talking to nurses and doctors to find out how they do it, was enough for that fleeting thought to be never considered again.<br>  <br>  Its called child abuse if you hit your child, yet ripping off a foreskin is ok? I never did work out how that can be acceptable.<br>  <br>  This is a very personal choice as I mentioned, and I hope you make up your own mind rather than going by what the majority of people think. Do your research, speak to some people and then see what your mind and heart tells you to do.<br>  <br>  btw - I am in Australia, and it is becomming more and more difficult to find a doctor that will do this. It seems to be a trend that is slowly diminishing...depending on what country you are from of course. I believe it is still quite the "norm" to have this done in some countries.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	It's a choice you should make yourself. Personally I wouldn't, but that's just me.|`|oF2kOKlnaa	It is up to your son - it is his body after all.  <br>  <br>  But really, no.  Why cut off something of your son's body that he might want later on?  He is born with it so leave it alone.  We don't mutilate our girls so why do this to our boys.  And don't listen to people who say it is cleaner as that is bollocks.  It is up to you as a parent (or his Dad) to teach him to keep it clean.<br>  <br>  Congratulations by the way - I have a six month little boy who is so adorable.  You are just going to fall in love with him!<br>  <br>  Edit:  Yes, it will hurt him at the time.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Yes it will hurt your baby, They very rarely ever use pain medication.<br>  <br>  I would leave my child as he was born. It would be wrong of me to remove a normal, healthy part of his body without his consent. It's my reponsability as a parent to protect him and his body and his choices and I would be abusing my power if I circumcised him.<br>  <br>  I mean what other part of my childs body will I be able to remove without a serious medical reason?<br>  That's right nothing, so why is the foreskin an exception?<br>  It's no cleaner or healthier to be circumcised. It should be illegal for me to touch my child in this way. I see it as sexual abuse.<br>  Circumcision takes away a lot of sensitivity, so it would be wrong of me to take away his sexual pleasure. That's his birth right.<br>  <br>  Infact I can't find one right thing about doing it. I think if I did it then I don't love or respect my child enough to be a good parent. That's just my opinion.<br>  <br>  It's not my body and therefore not my choice.<br>  <br>  I wish I had the choice and I never want my child looking at me like I look at my parents for doing it. I don't want my son to ever feel that betrayed.<br>  <br>  so I'd rather let him keep what rightfully belongs to him.<br>  <br>  a lot of people call it some useless peice of skin, well it might be useless to a few people but to me it's priceless and a wonderful part of my body I wish to have back.<br>  <br>  It's not my place and not my decision to make<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|AjqO1aJgaa	If he has a medical problem with a tight foreskin (some babies do) then yes.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, do you really think cosmetic surgery on a newborn is a good idea? Yes, of course it will hurt him. Newborns don't magically have no pain nerves in their penises.|`|rFtKFp03aa	It is up to you.... All the men my age (20's) are.. it was uncommon to see a man uncircumcised... <br>  <br>  then within the last 5 years I have more and more friends with babies who are not... <br>  <br>  I have 9 month old triplets - two boys... I had no idea what I wanted to do.. <br>  <br>  I would think all the children around our childrens ages will be 50 / 50 <br>  <br>  It is really up to you!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No don't. It's horribly painful for the baby, it's not necessary, and it's not even beneficial! Most people don't do it.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|AA11693808	It really is your choice. However, I would very strongly advise you not to circumcise him. There remains no significant enough health reason to circumcise. Pediatricians do not recommend it as a routine procedure unless the infant has a medical reason to do it. The pros of it are that your son won't remember it in the future and it is a little easier to clean. The cons are that it is painful, there is a risk of infection and bleeding and the hygiene benefit is offset by a higher risk for urinary tract infections and if you teach your son properly, he can wash and keep it clean anyway. <br>  <br>  Overall I would advise you against it, however it is ultimately your choice.|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	A word of advice:<br>  <br>  Do a thorough research on pros and cons of circumcision and make your own decision. I have found this topic to be as passionately debatable as abortion or religion. Many here will tell you how circumcision is amputation and mutilation and dramatic terms as such, and others will dramaticallt state how the baby "needs" to be circumcised.<br>  <br>  This is something you and your partenr (if you have one) will need to discuss, and for that, other than people telling you how cruel it is, you need to do a medical research.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	I left my son intact. It's perfectly clean. Never had any sort of problems. Will it hurt your baby? Yes. While the negative physiological effects of circumcision have been documented, it’s harm to the psychological and spiritual health of the previously intact baby is immeasurable. Circumcision robs the male of as much as 80% or more of his penile skin. Depending on the foreskins length, cutting it off makes the penis as much as 25% or more shorter.<br>  <br>  Careful anatomical investigation has shown that circumcision cuts off more than 3 ft. of veins, arteries, and capillaries, 240 ft. of nerves and more than 20,000 nerve endings. The foreskins’ muscles, glands, mucous membrane and epithelial tissues are destroyed as well.<br>  <br>  Recent studies published in leading medical journals have reported that circumcision has long lasting effects on the developing brain. Until recently, the myth was promulgated that infants’ nervous systems were not adequately developed to feel the pain of circumcision. The truth, with regard to the perception of pain, is that the nervous system of an infant is fully developed by the third trimester.<br>  <br>  Developmental neuropsychologist doctor James Prescot suggests that circumcision can cause deeper and more disturbing levels of neurological damage as well. the foreskin has three known functions.: protective, sensory, and sexual. More recently, medical doctors have admitted that infants do feel pain, and local anesthesia is often used now prior to circumcision. While this reduces certain responses to pain during the procedure, it does not eliminate them, and it introduces another painful procedure, the injection of the anesthesia.<br>  <br>  The effects of the local anesthesia wear off in a matter of hours. The pain experienced in the subsequent hours, days, and weeks is not affected by this anesthesia. This pain interferes with mother/infant bonding and breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  The foreskin protects the glans throughout life. It serves a sexual function because it is a highly innovated tissue and affects the size, shape and lubrication of the erect penis. It keeps the glans penis moist and soft, adding in foreplay, insertion and intercourse.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dry or painful sex is the most common sexual complaint of women in the U.S..According to a study published in the New Zealand Medical Journal, “Nine out of ten women prefer sex with intact men.”<br>  <br>  <br>  As a mother, a doula and an human rights activist, I beg you...leave your son intact. This procedure is cruel and abusive and robs the child of his rights to be whole. If you have any doubt watch a circumcision, there are plenty of them on the web.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmX6RdRNoqk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmX6RdRNo...</a><br>  <br>  Leave your son to make this decision when he is older. It is not your place to decide.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

In the USA it is declining as more people discover it is bad for children.  Currently the rate is 55% but soon more people will be intact.  <br>  <br>  With an intact boy, all you need to know is do not pull the foreskin back or try to clean under it.  This incorrect advice is often given by inexperienced doctors.  The foreskin is attached to the glans (head of penis, underneath the foreskin) at birth.  It should be left to separate naturally.  Once separated, the boy can pull the foreskin back.  This separation usually occurs from the ages of 0-10 , though it can occur in puberty.  Until it becomes retractable - there is no care.  After it becomes retractable then there is no danger - just tell your boy to wash under it in the shower like any other body part.  It takes 2 seconds.  here is full guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  the glans dries out.

In a way it's typical male behavior but if he sincerely cares about you and YOUR feelings then he would cut down his hours a bit, for YOU. At least he's working, I understand that, but the internet thing is so serious that if he wants to show you that you can trust him he needs to do something you ask of him. I had the same situation with the internet cheating and my husband and I'll be honest it hurts so much but I will give him this, he now does whatever I ask him to do to prove that I can trust him. <br>  I mean how do you know that your husbands not taking a few hours here and there on someone else's computer to do his dirt and then tells you he's working? We as women can never be too careful especially since a mans nature is to roam. And you shouldn't hold on to a relationship because you have kids or because of the money.

With the bad economy he does feel enormous financial pressure. That being said, he still found/ finds the time to chase our 23 month old around the house when he gets home, reads her stories, and makes her feel important to him every single day.

I am sure you would love some time to yourself each day too, but do you ever get it? It is wonderful to be accepting of your husband and who he is, but I would really try to bring up the issues of him tuning out in therapy.

Even with all of that, my husband has been amazing.<br>  He gives me massages, does house cleaning, takes care of the animals and pretty much does whatever I have asked of him.  Sometimes I try to clean and he takes it over.|`|4szKHHtJaa	During my first my husband was fairly adoring. He loved me and my pregnant body and would always to talk to the baby and pat my tummy, etc. I kind of expected the same this time around (our dd is now 2 as well and I'm 7 months pregnant) but have been trying to come to grips that this one just is not as "special" (that's his words) to him as the first. He works a lot too and I know that the little he will discuss, he is worried about supporting another baby/another mouth/another family member.That's probably what he thinks about most about. Sometimes he'll look at me still and go "wow, your pregnant" and I'm like "yeah, have been for a while now". He isn't sure how he'll make room for another being and can't imagine loving another one as much as our daughter, but I know we'll both manage just fine. It will become real to him in his own time. I know our circumstances our different, but you're certainly not alone in wanting more involvement and empathy from your husband. I hope you can all work it out.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	This happens a lot, I've noticed. Men handle responsibility by working and escaping (internet). I know you didn't ask for advice on what to do, but you can help him feel better by doing this (warning, this is hard to do) : Every time you see him, tell him what a hard worker he is. Touch his body and tell him what a hot hunk of meat he is. When he says something funny, laugh. When he makes a comment, let him know how insightful he is. How smart he is. You don't have to lie, tell him these important things that every man wants to know about themselves, that are really actually true. The hard part is don't expect anything from him. Don't expect attention, sex, or any gratification on his part. His cup needs to fill up then overflow before the wonderful loving attention and support spills out onto you. If you expect something in return for these tokens, you will cancel them out, and his cup won't fill, and this could go on for a long time. I know you are pregnant, and need a lot during this time, and you are doing a lot of hard work just by existing at this point, because you are creating another human being. It's hard. I can tell you this having been at the deepest darkest rock bottom point of the well you find yourself in now.  Sometimes you may feel so depressed or frustrated, you don't know if you can help but to scream that he needs to pay attention to you. Do it when he's not around. Cry in private. Trust me please.  <br>  <br>  And even the counseling could be, to him, another aspect of you forcing him to do something he doesn't want to do, he might just be putting up with it. Men don't necessarily explain themselves well to a counselor, and to have the counselor agreeing with you all the time could be reinforcing the idea that he's not manly. Men want to be manly. They want to be in control. That's actually a good thing, though I notice society discourages it more and more. If the man sees that he is in control, he is happy, and wants to be there for you. It's really hard for a woman to understand. It took me a looooooong time to figure out.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Same thing happened to me, I trusted him went without a condom and got an STD. Most men are asymptomatic when it comes to STD's he may say he doesn't have anything but in less he's been tested and recently you don't know. Use the condom and make sure it stays on the whole time if he takes it off, he is disrespecting you and your body!|`|uuceuyRyaa	use a condom <br>  <br>  <br>  or DONT have sex.<br>  <br>  don't be STUPID|`|AA10525436	ALWAYS USE A CONDOM!!! I was once in a relationship and I thought things were perfect. We had sex without a condom and he gave me a bad STD. Never trust anyone unless you have gone with them and both been tested. Sometimes you can have an STD and not know it. Condoms don't only prevent pregnancy. Be smart and don't regret it later. If you get herpes that affects you and your pregnancies later in life.|`|mFQydvncaa	YOU SOUND LIKE YOU HAVENT HAD SEX, OR LIKE YOUR SCARED, IF YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A CONDOM YOU SHOULDNT HAVE SEX. <br>  <br>  IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SEX YES USE A CONDOM, USE A NEW ONE EVERY TIME!!! DO NOT RELY ON THE PULL OUT METHOD AND GO TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD YOU CN BE PUT ON BIRTH CONTROL.<br>  <br>  GOODLUCK AND BE SMART|`|HAEIpcAraa	Of course.  Is a baby worth the risk of not using a condom?|`|PZYOTy2Haa	Definitely. there not that expensive and will save trouble in the long run|`|zVFPuAFTaa	I would say yes you should use a condom. If you can't afford birth control, how are you going to afford a child?
sbeoF50gaa	You CAN get pregnant even if you're on your period. You can also get pregnant even if he "pulls out" The "lubricant" the guy produces contains sperm. I think you can take a test in 3 weeks. Or you can wait for your next period to start to find out.|`|hb94oOSeaa	Yes you are in fact you are going to have triplets- two girls and 1 boy<br>  Congrats!|`|4d5669748fdad422cfff157e567591a8aa	Chances are no, but there is always a possibility. <br>  <br>  For future reference even if a guy doesn't *** in you he can still get you pregnant, it's called pre ejaculation. You sound young, so please use protection. If you have a kid now that is a lot of responsibility and my tax dollars will have to pay for it.|`|RK3oG32Kaa	i highly doubt you are pregnant because you lose your egg when on your period.|`|X0ogo44Maa	I think I need more information, sister

Fy9S6hjIaa	We chose two middle names for our son just because we're not sure if we'll have more than one child and there were two very special people we wanted to honor.  We didn't really like one for first name and it would have honestly been too painful to use the other as a first name.  I personally wouldn't have thought to ever give a child two middle names, but several of my husbands family members have two middle names, so he suggested it.  Many of my family members and friends think that his name is too long, but its just perfect for our little boy.  I couldn't imagine him being named anything else.<br>  <br>  The other funny thing is that our last name is also a very common first name, so if you say it all together it sounds like the has 3 middle names.|`|81nGin29aa	Well, when I get a daughter, I would like her to have two middle names:  Clare Ardith, after my mother and paternal grandmother who died of cancer.  But there's one condition:  My last name begins with a "B", so I don't my girl's first given name to begin with an "S."<br>  <br>  I know of a few people with two middle names:  John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (a.k.a. J.R.R. Tolkien; author of "The Lord of the Rings" and "the Hobbit"), George Herbert Walker Bush (father of Obama's predecessor in the U.S. Presidency), and William Lyon Mackenzie King (a.k.a. W.L. Mackenzie King; a Canadian Prime Minister who served every other term three times).|`|n30k2fy9aa	one, except if its like maryanne or somthing, those compound names are cute i think.<br>  P.S. you hit "f" instead of  "r" in the title question thingy, it looks really weird, oh whatever...|`|miOor5SRaa	Only 1...2 middles is not nessecary, especially if they are catholic then they get a confirmation name OMG just way too long|`|2iXuzHgwaa	Well, I have a daughter named Noah Elizabeth Alissia, and I am currently pregnant with my second daughter at age 22, who I am going to name, Reagan Anne-lise Morgan.

Their names were Ann and Mary, he middles names are Ann Marie. Now my son, he only has 1, after is grandpa. I guess it depends on if their is a valid reason for me. I couldn't just honor one of her grandmas over the other?|`|8EuaEGkyaa	1 middle name=]<br>  <br>  Sometimes people can choose 2 that DO sound good together though!  But i don't like it when the name is really long like Amelia Victoria Isabella!|`|OV6O8Xwxaa	I prefer one middle name.<br>  Its more traditional and 2 middle names just kinda takes to long I guess.<br>  My Dad doesn't have a middle name :)|`|mqNxYMuUaa	ohhh defo one x|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Savannah Scarlett-Belle<br>  Evangeline Ella-Danielle<br>  Liam-James Tyler<br>  <br>  They are my children names.|`|ZX2so3twaa	1 middle name. i think 2 is too many.
c36f730420e4f3afbc8723ca87f206fdaa	You definitely can not get pregnant while you are on your period and there was no need for a plan B pill because the plan B pill just makes you have your period therefore releasing your eggs.<br>  <br>  No need to worry about it too much because the more you stress over it the higher change that you will have a late or lighter period because of the imbalance of your hormones. <br>  <br>  When people say you can be pregnant and still have your period they mean spotting if you have it for at least 3 days or more I think you should be good.|`|cie3oBcXaa	I would say that by taking the morning after pill, it has mucked up your cycle. Give it a couple of months and you should be back to normal with your cycle.|`|nUW4oioxaa	Why is this question always asked and the answer is always the same. Just do a test!!!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	the morning afterpill mucks up peoples cycles, thats all it will be|`|0btrijJCaa	Okay, why did you have unprotected sex in the first place?

Q4sgYeMLaa	I Hope you get help before you do anything that'll last forever<br>  Umm I don't think that you should try to do that.<br>  I mean they say that if you do cut off your circulation you're hand can fall off.<br>  Yeah Basically it'll just kill your hand, not really just fall off but your head will be dead and worthless, so they'll have to amputate it.<br>  You know when its too tight when its really snug on your wrist like uncomfortable tight. Then you're hand will change color, fell alittle strange, almost numb.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Yes, they can cut of circulation, and stop the muscle from moving. <br>  <br>  They can get as bad as amputations.|`|7SCjPftKaa	It will probably cause a small amount of bruising but snapping at your wrist will not just cause you to suddenly die. Choose one that's loose so when you're not snapping at it, it won't affect your circulation. There's really no need to wear so many, though. One on each wrist will do the job. <br>  <br>  At the end of the day, any damage you do with an elastic band pales in comparison to cutting. Hence why counselor's recommend it.<br>  <br>  By the way, you kind of give the impression that you WANT to cut off your circulation "and will it work wen i do?". If you're having suicidal feelings, I suggest you talk to someone.|`|SpYS7VYoaa	No, thats only if they are really tight, it would hurt and your hand would become numb, it can get to a really bad point, but with rubberbands used for snapping, well I've never heard of people dying from that. Just stretch out the rubber bands or get bigger ones. Youd know if it was cutting off your circulation also jsut from the imprints it would leave when you looked under them(they go away though when blood starts circulating properly)<br>  Also, what do you mean will it work when i do? Do you want to die? If so, please please please speak to someone, anyone, even if its me, I use to cut but your life can get better!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Depending on how tight they are. They may just slow circulation to that part of the body. If that happens for too long,some serious damage can be done.|`|8chxrFFQaa	as long as ur hands dont feel weird then its fine. just dont have it too tight.|`|rFXt8ygGaa	can do if to tight but if plenty of room then its safe remember leave room cause u can swell up when ur warm|`|fSO7kfdGaa	Rubber bands only cut of circulation when their to tight. Just wearing them to snap your arm should not tight enough to cause this. If you were to lose circulation take it off at soon as possible to let natural blood flow take place. Their should not be any permanent damage.

6zPCQ7rPaa	yeah it is probably just your brain. way too early to have any stretching or bulging.take it easy on the food.i gained way too much weight in the beginning of both my pregnancies.it is hard to get it off.|`|AA10300801	That all sounds normal to me.  Your belly wont begin to stretch for a while - you are probably just getting bloated.  It happens.  :)|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	yes ,either you are putting on weight or you are a lot more pregnant than you think ,even with twins you would not be stretching yet .
2irmTjQ3aa	At about 24 weeks, maybe a little earlier. But now that I am 32 weeks you can definately feel the movements from outside and even see the movements, it's awesome.|`|X3zl9hZCaa	My husband felt her for the 1st time on valentines day and i was 6 months exactly so 24 weeks for me but everyone is different|`|rKQ9l81kaa	You should be feeling that pretty soon. At this point it could even be any day now. It was that way for me, I'm about 24 weeks now and I've been feeling the baby move from the outside for a while now. The waiting is hard to do I know! You wont always feel it from the outside when the baby moves-just when the baby moves hard enough, which it will. You'll soon begin to notice that baby is more active and gets stronger. It's very exciting.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	There's really no exact answer someone can give you and be correct because everyone is different.  Many different factors go into this like, your weight and the childs size and HOW active they are.  Thinner women tend to feel movement earlier, see it earlier and more often than women who carry more weight. But, if you are already feeling it quite a few times during the day, it should be within the next few weeks!<br>  <br>  ...and I noticed I got a thumbs down on this one, I take it someone PROBABLY took offense to the size matter I mentioned.  Just to let you know I am not exactly thin myself...and I don't mean it to be any harm.  It is a proven fact...if you don't believe me...yahoo it!!!  :o)<br>  <br>  But like I said before, every woman and every pregnancy is different!|`|YI31TqNNaa	i weighed 160 before i got pregnant, and my baby's father felt the baby first move at 20 weeks. honestly, we were both very surprised. he was just resting his hand on  my stomach and felt a kick. it didnt happen too much after that until about 25 weeks, then he could feel it just about any time i lied down. but i suppose it is different for each female|`|mFQydvncaa	IM 20 WEEKS, AND I HAVE FELT MINE MOVE SINCE 12 WEEKS KICKS SINCE 17 WEEKS BUT HER KICKS ARE ONLY A COUPLE TIMES A DAY AND USUALLY IN THE MORNING HOURS LIKE 3 AM AND SUCH. I CANT WAIT TO SEE HER KICKING AND FEEL IT FROM OUTSIDE. I BELIEVE IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO MAYBE ITLL HAPPEN!! <br>  <br>  CONGRATS AND GOODLUCK|`|71e15ac317ae5351e487d5c38939daabaa	I think my husband felt our baby move at about 6 months. But I have alittle more padding (fat) on my stomach, so if you are thinner maybe it would be sooner?|`|AA10525436	Around 23-24 weeks. But much better at around 30 weeks
AA11296427	Are you pretending? *Glares*<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|1s3nddaYaa	girls have been doing that since i was in the 8th grade and im 20. girls are just weird, their are other ways to get attention, and not give off the impression your a whore|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Yeah, I think it's kinda silly too.<br>  I get annoyed when 9 - 13 year old girls crowd around telling us how Keacie and Kaydance are cool names and how that's what they plan on naming the twins they've ended up pregnant with as a result of a loving, fully stable junior high relationship. <br>  <br>  I don't think these girls should be making up dramatic scenarios for themselves. I mean what are they doing? Prepping themselves for their future mistake?|`|8ngDDwhVaa	I know a girl who spread it around my school that she was pregnant. She's 14. It's really anoying. We think she did it because she's embarased she's a virgin and wanted to make it seem like someone would actualy have sex with her.|`|AtnRHgBxaa	I find it worrying that teenage girls havent got anything better to think about than getting pregnant.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Hahahah I was just thinking about this earlier. I saw a girl who said she was 14 and pregnant with quads and she was naming them all 'Heaven' and things like that. *VOMITS*|`|zsx4L2Hhaa	it is dumb and ridiculous.<br>  pregnancy is suppose to be beautiful and treasured.<br>  not a billboard for attention.
Vm7vpqsmaa	i have too little Brothers who do crazy things like that all the time i know how you feel|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Some things are better left unknown.|`|qv0CKH18aa	Hahah. My brother is 14 and I'm 15 and since he's only 14 months younger than me, him and his friends thinks it's "cute" to raid my underware drawer. Boys all ways do stuff like this. Especially if they have a sister, I would know...|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Ughh. Don't worry about it XD That was funny though.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would love a little sibling - consider yourself lucky. I just have an older brother  :)|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Oh don't worry about it. He was probably just curious. It's all part of growing up and going through puberty. Little sisters are worse though.|`|0Kw2yVp4aa	umm i think its hormones or like hes just REALLY weird!<br>  <br>  sry|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	Lol. Funny Funny. Dont say anything to him he is probly going to a weird stage in his life. Boys are will weridos! lol get used to it now|`|RPPrfphqaa	curiosity im sure he seen it and was like wtf is this thing LOL
AA12384954	Everything will be back to normal before you know it.  You will be so busy and sleep-deprived with your new baby that it will all disappear overnight almost.  I never really noticed when they disappeared, only that one day they were gone.  Don't worry and let your body take it's time to adjust normally.  Wax if you really find it necessary; I don't actually remember that part though.|`|fVnbFLsQaa	They're not stretch marks, they're Birth Medals, it's an honour to have them.|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	the line fades but the nipples will never be the same colour again,they will fade but not back to what they were . .wax the hair ...
sbeoF50gaa	take away the things he loves most. Video games, Watching TV, talking on the phone, going out with his friends. It's like grounding but your taking away his privilages instead of sending them to their room where all there stuff is. If they misbehave take away :)|`|kD38Qwhsaa	Well for me it depends on the situation but no matter what don't show no signs of weakness. when ever it came time for me to discipline i always keep it really life situations put them in a scenario that pertain to when they grow up in life and how this will affected he\she.Good Luck|`|3vToYNA2aa	You should start with time outs and explain to him why is that and talk to him why is his behavior unacceptable...he might just need some more attention..try to understand and find a reason why is he misbehaving:-)|`|cz9dogpvaa	spank him|`|45nSn7Rcaa	The same way you should have been doing from birth.  With rules and consequences and 100% consistancy.|`|hChhOhOGaa	What did they do?
JjBwydymaa	Ive never heard of it hun!! I think it should be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck TTC x|`|iBWcAw4Oaa	No, i don't think it does. Good luck with BD :) baby dust xxx.|`|AA11724307	no its fine.  In fact I work at a dentist office and we do work on pregnant people.  Its only really necessary to be care if its during your first trimester.  If your not even pregnant then there is nothing to worry about.  good luck|`|rCjRRDF5aa	Having the filling when you're supposed to be ovulating shouldn't affect anything. If you're really worried though, ask the dentist just in case before they work on your teeth.|`|xwOwsZvEaa	i no where ur coming from but i think it the anesthetic would only b a prob if u were pregnant,<br>  hope this helped<br>  good luck ttc xx|`|JDw1RDcaaa	It will not effort anything
ODM6fORNaa	yes this is definitely common, everything has been stretched down there. talk to your doctor about it and if it bothers you they can do surgery|`|PCK5bJt3aa	I had a baby, and yes your body is never the same but I don't think this extra skin is normal. If you don't feel comfortable with your partner looking, go to the OBGYN they see vaginas for a living so they can give you a better assessment if you need to get surgery.|`|innTNQg4aa	yeah, deffinintely go see the gyno. they can help you a lot more than your partner can. <br>  hope its all good :]
ODM6fORNaa	definitely eat normally. they want to make sure it's a regular thing for your glucose to be high based on what your diet is now. once it comes back again they will ask you questions about your typical diet and then diagnos you from there, then they will probably change your diet.|`|QXREldcEaa	Eat like you always do so you get an accurate result!|`|RjdrO7DVaa	eat normally.  it will benefit you and the baby to be diagnosed properly.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I would definitely start eating healthier because its not going to mess up the test...when you take the test they see how u react to the drink they give u and ur not allowed to eat anything an hour before...so what u have been eating or change to eating wont make up the test!
U8oR3VU6aa	Because it only takes one sperm to make the trek. I know a lot of people who have used a condom and failed. From what you posted I am assuming you mean for birth control and not for disease prevention. If you are asking about disease prevention, it still applies. Because there is an opening near the base of the shaft, (and it only takes a bit of fluid making contact ) it makes the odds a bit less than a hundred percent. I don't believe anything works a hundred percent.|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	I have heard of them breaking ,and if they are not placed on right they can come off during sex making them less afective .If they are used right they are a good protection.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	My husband and I used them as our only source of birth control for 11 years.  There were many times I wished for one of the darn things to fail, but it never happened.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	there 98% because they break..and no sperm are tiny you cannot see them come out...my bestfriend used one and got pregnant|`|Jswomud7aa	There are such things as a manufacturer's defect. Not everything can always be 100%.<br>  <br>  I don't know anyone that has used a condom and it failed without being due to the "user" mishandling it.|`|T48smu01aa	Only 98% b/c they can have holes or they can break....and yes My aunt got pregnant while using a condom and birth control ...it happens but it is very vry rare thats why they say 98%

Some people have hardly any signs and other people have loads.  The most common first sign is a missed period.  Other signs include changes in diet, feeling dizzy, sick or faint, mood swings, sore breasts, increased need to pee and increase in cervical discharge!  Hope this helps!!

ENANtueuaa	My daughter didn't even start potty training till she was 2, and wasn't fully potty trained until her 3rd birthday. There is not rush, she's still young! Just let her go at her own pace for right now, she'll get the hang of it.|`|145RUNQHaa	Firstly relax your daughter will pick up on any stress you have over potty training.you seem to be in a big rush for her to be potty trained there's no need to be.the majority of children are closer to three by the time potty training is well established.i started potty training my son who's not yet two but he didn't seem ready so i'm leaving it for a while.you won't be half as frustrated if you take it slower are you sure she's ready?if so make sure to reward her for doing anything on the potty make it a pleasant experience for her and make on fuss over any little accidents.x
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	It will likely be 3-5 before he shows a dominance in one hand or the other.<br>  <br>  My older two children (11 and 8) are both left handed, but it was about 4 before we were sure of it.  I have a 1 year old and we are still waiting to see what hand she will be dominant with.|`|ODM6fORNaa	start to watch and see what hand he used the most like to pick things up and point at things|`|innTNQg4aa	dont worry about it, just wait and see which one he is. cuz itll probably take longer than four months to know for sure anyways.<br>  <br>  :]
eytlIKITaa	Yes, too soon to be having symptoms...  Not sure how you would get an STD response out of this question besides the unprotected part...|`|PdxMOlcaaa	You didn't mention if you where having problems with your urination.  The cramping and being tired make me wonder if your not having a Urinary tract infection.  Go see your physician and don't have unprotected sex anymore.  Your life is more important than a few minutes of pleasure.|`|kLHq6HaEaa	well everyone is different, and to be honest i had symptoms and knew i was pregnant before my missed period too and my main symptom was diarrhea..i also just didnt feel myself. so you may be pregnant..i highly doubt its a std.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	It might be to soon but i had the same exact symptoms before i found out i was pregnant...but it was about a month later right before my missed period. so u could be pregnant just take a test!|`|TWq0Hmx6aa	Too soon to tell
bQTATDTyaa	Just like others have said, if he's gaining weight he's fine.<br>  <br>  Formula fed babies tend to gain a lot faster than breastfed, and that's fine, it is the way nature intended (slower growth not quick). Also, growth has a lot to do with genetics.<br>  <br>  Also, at 6 months you can start to introduce some solids which will add a few extra calories.|`|AykczQleaa	15% for weight?  Its ok...my son is bottle bed only and is only in the 12% for his weight. The dr said all babies grow differently and as long as he's gaining...then its ok.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Have you tried the platex nipples? They also have those nursing harnesses that you can use like a backpack, they are just a pain.|`|e49178f67a815a64799d8c1237b9affaaa	Tommy Tippee breast to bottle bottles were great when I did it.<br>  <br>  Get your partner to do it in a different room at the start.  Mine would only take it from my husband at the start as she could smell my milk.<br>  <br>  Then she got used to it and took it from me.<br>  <br>  I would also give it a good 15 mins of her refusing it before I gave up.  Then i would wait a good while before offering her the breast in case she got the idea that if she refused she'd get milk from me.<br>  <br>  Try substituting one feed at a time over a period of say two weeks.  So start with the 11 am feed and then once he is accepting it, then move onto the 2pm one.  Try and leave morning and last feed till last as this could stress him out a good bit otherwise.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Your choice, but for the record, as long as he is gaining weight and not losing the percentiles don't matter. <br>  <br>  But for your question, pump breast milk and mix 6 oz of breastmilk with 2 oz of formula and keep upping the formula. Have someone besides you give him the bottle. The playtex drop ins worked the best for my breast fed babies, my 4 month old will ONLY take that bottle while i am at work.<br>  <br>  I have heard that babies who make the switch more difficult that these bottle work, because in stead of having one hole, they have multiple holes like a mother's breast-<a href="http://www.secondnaturefeeding.com/bottlefeeding/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.secondnaturefeeding.com/bottl...</a>|`|FUNhlpiqaa	OMG!!  Don't switch you baby to formula because he doesn't measure up to those charts!  My breastfed babies were always on the "small side," but they are coming out in recent studies that it is healthy for a baby to not have too much excess weight!  I don't know this for a fact, but I read in a book those charts were designed in the 50s or 60s and were only done on formula fed children.  Breastfeeding is what nature intended and it really is best for your baby.  You know your baby better than some chart... does he seem like he is sickly or unhealthy?|`|5ZwIASCgaa	they have new bottles shaped almost exactly like a breast a few people i know love them i would try that...or do have formula have breast milk and maybe if he gets the taste of some breast milk in a bottle he will end up liking it and u can completely switch him. the bottle is called the adiri natural nurser|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	My son is 7 1/2 mths and still will not have a bottle and I've been trying since he was 3mths...they know what they like best i'm sorry to say!! Good luck though...if you do manage to do it let me know how lol!|`|tyJYhyEjaa	My friend had a hard time getting her kid to use a bottle so she bought this boob thing that went on the bottle so her kid would take the bottle.  Maybe u could google adn see where they sell them.  Maybe try diffrent nipples too.

Vm7vpqsmaa	The Odds of Having a Boy or a Girl<br>  You may have heard it from your know-it-all in-law, or a snidely friend who happens to have one-of-each, or maybe even your doctor: after having 2 or 3 boys, you might as well forget about ever having a daughter, because the odds are you're going to keep having boys. Or if you've only had girls, that the odds are stacked against you for having a boy. <br>  Well, my dear, we are about to take a look at data from over 6,000 families in the US, and you are about to become better informed than your MIL on this issue! <br>  <br>  A Lot of Babies<br>  The data used here is from "NLSY", the National Longitudinal Study of Youth conducted by the US Dept. of Labor. The NLSY is a nationally representative sample of 12,686 men and women who were aged 14 to 22 in 1979. These people were interviewed annually on all sorts of topics through 1994, and are currently interviewed biannually. (Data is taken from the Chance Magazine article, Does Having Boys or Girls Run in the Family?)<br>  NLSY Families by Number of Children <br>  1 Child 1,881  31% <br>  2 Children 2,444  40% <br>  3 Children 1,301  21% <br>  4+ Children 463  8% <br>  Total Families 6,089   <br>  <br>  <br>  Note: There weren't enough families with more than 4 children for statistical analysis. In these families, only the first 4 children were counted.<br>  Total Boys/Girls in NLSY Families <br>  Boys 6,389  51% <br>  Girls 6,135  49% <br>  Total 12,524   <br>  <br>  <br>  The 51/49 Boy/Girl Ratio<br>  The ratio of 51% boys to 49% girls seen here is representative of overall US birth rates. There are many hypotheses about why there are slightly more boys born each year than girls, but no one knows for sure why this is so. Here are a couple of the theories:<br>  Males are more fragile (male infants are less likely to survive their first year, and a man's expected lifespan is less than a woman's). The slightly higher conception rate of males is nature's way of evening out the balance. <br>  As Shettles contents, Y-bearing male-producing sperm may have a speed advantage over X-bearing female-producing sperm, more often winning the race to fertilize the egg and resulting in more male conceptions. <br>  Regardless of the reason, the 51/49 ratio remains constant year to year throughout the US population. <br>  Are Boys or Girls Preferred?<br>  The Chance study describes "stopping behavior" -- the tendency of parents to stop having children after having the desired gender or genders. Parents in the US may have a "balance preference", a desire to have one of each gender. Here's what the data shows: <br>  Did the first child's gender influence whether to have a second child?<br>  Parents are slightly more likely to stop having children if the first child is a girl. <br>  First Child Parents Having 2nd Child <br>  Boy  70% <br>  Girl  68% <br>  <br>  Did previous children's gender influence whether to have a third child?<br>  Parents are 6% more likely to stop having children if the first two children are a boy and a girl. <br>  Of parents with two same-gender children, parents of two girls are 3% more likely to stop having children than parents of two boys. <br>  Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child <br>  Boy/Boy  46% <br>  Boy/Girl  39% <br>  Girl/Girl  43% <br>  This table shows families with two same-gender children combined. Previous Children Parents Having 3rd Child <br>  Same Gender  45% <br>  Mixed Gender  39% <br>  <br>  What about the fourth child?<br>  Parents of 3 same-gender children are only 2% more likely to have a 4th child than parents with mixed-gender children. <br>  Parents of 2 boy, 1 girl families are the most likely to have a 4th child. <br>  Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child <br>  3 Boys  29% <br>  2 Boys, 1 Girl  35% <br>  1 Boy, 2 Girls  20% <br>  3 Girls  26% <br>  This table shows families with same-gender children compared to families with mixed-gender children. Previous Children Parents Having 4th Child <br>  Same Gender  28% <br>  Mixed Gender  26% <br>  <br>  Odds of Having a Boy or a Girl<br>  Okay, finally! Let's look at the odds of having a boy or a girl, given that previous children are all of the opposite gender.<br>  <br>  Odds of Having a Girl<br>  The odds of having a girl seem decrease after having each boy, but only very slightly. Even after 3 boys, you are only 6.4% more likely to have a 4th boy than a girl.<br>  Previous Children % Girl Births <br>  None  49% Girls <br>  1 Boy  50% Girls <br>  2 Boys  47.7% Girls <br>  3 Boys  43.6% Girls <br>  <br>  <br>  Odds of Having a Boy<br>  The odds of having a boy seem to increase after having girls, except after 2 girls, when a 3rd girl is more likely.<br>  Previous Children % Boy Births <br>  None  51% Boys <br>  1 Girl  54.5% Boys <br>  2 Girls  46.0% Boys <br>  3 Girls  52.7% Boys <br>  <br>  <br>  Gender and Birth Order<br>  Given the charts above, it looks like you are slightly more likely to have a boy, regardless of previous children. This is probably due to the overall 51/49 boy/girl birth ratio. This ratio, interestingly, varies slightly with birth order; it isn't consistent among first-borns, second-borns, etc. 1st Born  51.0% Boys <br>  2nd Born  52.2% Boys <br>  3rd Born  48.6% Boys <br>  4th Born  50.8% Boys <br>  <br>  Odds of Having an All Sam|`|zlGb9NkZaa	the gender is NOT determined solely by the male. sure, it is determined by the sperm that fertilizes the egg, but YOUR body influences WHICH sperm gets through, an X or a Y. each type has different characteristics & different weaknesses. for example, Y sperm (for a boy) is faster, but doesn't live as long & doesn't tolerate a more acidic environment (uterus) as the X sperm. <br>  <br>  so, timing of intercourse in relation to ovulation & pH of your vagina/uterus (influenced by diet & other factors), as well as your follicular phase (the time between menstruation and ovulation) can shift the likelihood of having a boy or girl.|`|sk46uigvaa	My husband comes from a family of all males, yet we have a 3 year old little girl. Makes no difference.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	Did you know when you ovulated? Did you have sex before the ovulation to get pregnant (likely a girl) or after the ovulation to get pregnant (likely a boy)? The slow long living sperm that make girl babies stick around to meet up with the egg when it descends later on. The fast swimming, short lived sperm that make boy babies get to the egg first if it's there already waiting. Even the kind of discharge you make is more conducive for a girl before you ovulate, and more conducive for a boy after you ovulate. Isn't that neat?|`|RPPrfphqaa	my boyfriend comes from a family of males he just has one sister..<br>  he has 3 girls now.<br>  5yr old<br>  2yr old<br>  and one in the oven..<br>  you just might surprise yourself..<br>  now he's dying for boy LOL|`|S5GP2nlUaa	Hey it was like that in my family too.

You are right in saying the male chooses the gender but there is always a chance of a girl or boy!  I too had this same feeling. ...almost.  Me and my husband were actually wanting a little boy and we just found out we are having a girl.  I thought for sure it was a boy because his father is 1 of 17...15 boys...and he is one of 5....3 boys....so my chances were defenatly leaning toward a boy...but I am prego with a girl!  So just wait it out...and keep your fingers crossed!  Good luck!|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	there is always a chance ! ..and there are ways of helping nature along but its too late for that this time but if you have a boy this time look into timing the conception next time ...|`|4hzUOmEOaa	yes its still 50 50 bc I have a best friend that had all boys in his family and finally his brother had twin girls. so its still 50 50|`|AA10525436	You still have a chance.

You can also google "fertility calculators" and plug in your information to get a more accurate count.|`|byZLMkSzaa	you usually ovulate within 2 weeks after u ended ur period soo for the 2 weeks after your period just get busy!!!
AA12006844	Did you use a condom when you had sex? Just because you have been taking the pill for ten years does not make you immune to getting pregnant. <br>  <br>  You should take a pregnancy test because it is possible if you didn't use a back-up form of birth control.
hIzQyflqaa	usually you dont get morning sickness until around 6weeks pregnant (4 weeks after concieving) so if you think that this bleed may have been implantation and your dates from your last period would make you around 6wks then it is very possible you are pregnant, i didnt get a positive with my boy until i was 8wks preg and this time i got one 3wks 4 days pregnant! good luck|`|wJcpjDLUaa	I would take another HPT.  Just to be on the safe side.|`|8EW3JDmbaa	I dont really know, but I have started to wonder if I am in the same position, my period started 2 days late on Feb 10th but was only 2-3 days. The past week on the 16th I felt faint an nauseous and was actually sick, then all last wek I was very tired. Has a glass of wine on friday night and again felt very sick. This is not normal for me.<br>  maybe I should also take a test.<br>  I think you should take another test to be sure when you say faint negative - do you mean there were 2 lines because even if the 2nd line is there and it is faint it is a positive. test again with you first urine of the day and best wishes I hope you get the outcome you want.
C4ibOR7Laa	hi, getting a negative varies, it took me 21 weeks!!! i thought i was going crazy and thought i was pregnant, but i wasn't, just left over hormones.<br>  <br>  as for trying again you can start trying before a missed period, it just means if you do get pregnant before a period, it will be harder to date, meaning an early scan, which is always nice anyways :)|`|wh3EJtZeaa	Your test will still say positive due to all the hormones still there. I would give your body a couple of months to get back to normal, and also emotionally. If you are not quite back to full health, you might get stressed about the next pregnancy, which is really not good, & cause more problems, so rest up & i'm sure things will all work out fine. Good luck.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I would give your body 4 to 6 weeks to adjust to not being pregnant for your test to be negative.  Then your period cycle should start again.  At least that's what happened with me.|`|S5GP2nlUaa	Wait 3 - 6 months so you can give your body time to heal. Believe me I have has three miscarriages because of not waiting and being impatient.

1ac29c0f1a9a7cbbe46f018e5f6d0f7faa	I replied to your other similar question, because I hadn't seen this one. I'm glad you spoke with your OB, and provided us a little more detail! <br>  <br>  If you're bleeding more heavily than just spotting,  I would probably insist upon labs and an ultrasound, if you haven't done that already.<br>  <br>  If you start bleeding very heavily, saturating pads within 1-2 hours or passing clots, then you need to go to the ER right away, whether you have cramping or not.<br>  <br>  If you do miscarry, it's not because of anything you could have done differently. If it came to the D&C, I would probably do it... Less risk of retained tissue and infection... But please don't think about losing that baby, and have faith! <br>  <br>  Refrain from sex for now (if you're not already). Also,  if you're straining at bowel movements consider a fiber supplement (Metamucil) and increasing your fluid intake! Both intercourse and straining can increase bleeding.<br>  <br>  Now I'll just paste the reply I made to your other question:<br>  <br>  Bleeding during pregnancy can sometimes be a sign of miscarriage, but not always! For example, many women experience spotting (light intermittent bleeding when wiping) and have a perfectly healthy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you're having more than spotting, then I'd call the OB right away.<br>  <br>  If you're not having any cramping and not passing any clots, you are probably fine, but you can't be careful enough with your baby's health! That's why I advise seeking the help of your OB or midwife.<br>  <br>  A small amount of bleeding can be perfectly normal in the first trimester. The American Pregnancy Association (linked below) states that 20-30% of pregnant women have bleeding in early pregnancy, and half of those women do NOT have miscarriages. The Medline article (also linked below) quotes a different statistic, saying that about 10% of women have some bleeding during pregnancy. So the numbers are inconsistent, but the fact remains that for some pregnancies, bleeding is NOT a sign of impending doom. That should be some comfort.<br>  <br>  Depending upon your situation, you may notice and increase in spotting after straining to move your bowels or after an orgasm.<br>  <br>  Everybody is different. Call your OB; an ultrasound and bloodwork can give you more information than we can!<br>  <br>  Also, wear a pad so you can gauge how much you're bleeding. If you notice an increase in the amount or the appearance of clots or tissue, you should head to the ER.<br>  <br>  And by the way, implantation bleeding occurs about 4 weeks after the last menstrual period, not at 9 or 7 weeks as stated by Greeneyed.<br>  <br>  If it's any reassurance, I'm going through the same thing and I've done a lot of reading and spoken to lots of more experienced moms. Quite a few of my friends have had spotting and gone on to have healthy babies.|`|t7iOijRPaa	omg...i wish you the best of luck...<br>  it could be a miscarragie|`|AA11599140	Unfortunately, waiting is really the only thing you can do.  I would probably be in bed as much as you can and let your body rest.

AA11763588	Sperm can hang out living in the body for 72 hours (sometimes longer) waiting on an egg.<br>  <br>  So if you are trying, and you are ovulating now you could have a chance to be pregnant.

4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	There are two types of twins: identical and fraternal.<br>  <br>  Identical twins occur when a single fertilized egg splits into two. This is a random event and is not an inherited trait. It occurs in one in 250 pregnancies.<br>  <br>  Fraternal twins occur when two eggs are released in one cycle and the each egg is fertilized by a sperm. It is thought that the ability to release more than a single egg in one cycle can be a trait that is inherited from mother to daughter. (It's probably obvious that a father cannot pass down ovulation traits to a daughter.)<br>  <br>  Your chances of having twins are exactly the same as the general public. You have no increased chances of having twins.<br>  <br>  The eye color question is hard to answer. We are in the same boat. I have blue eyes and my husband has hazel. All research I have found only talks about blue, brown and green (not hazel). I know that blue and hazel are possibilities, but green might be too. And I don't know the likelihood of each happening. So far we have one biological son with blue eyes (and a son who was adopted with brown).|`|alMWU45waa	for you to conceive twins they have to run in your family coz for non identical twins u need to release 2 eggs and for you to conceive identical twins your egg needs to divide to create two identical babies. and twins normally skip a generation|`|miOor5SRaa	Twins skip a generation normally that will slim your chances but hey you could always hope!

Have the doctor determine whats wrong.<br>  <br>  By the way you do have a pulse in your stomach, and in your arm and leg etc.  you wont feel a fetus's heart beat with your finger.<br>  It is possible for somthing to happen with a date rape drug, although, I don't know how you would not have noticed when you woke up.  But that's never happened to me.....|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	If you had been given a date rape drug you would have lost time ,been out of it for a while so unless you got drunk and don't remember anything that night it is not likely any one raped you .And you can not be pregnant any other way .I think you should go to a doctor .you could have some other problem .|`|sbeoF50gaa	I've heard that the date rape drugs does have the effect of no memory... so that is always possible. But 2 months is too early for you to "feel" a heartbeat, I never felt a heart beat when I was pregnant. 2 months is also too early to feel movement. Your "baby" would only be about half an inch big. So showing is probably unlikely as well. Most women don't start to show until 4-5 months. I'd go see a Dr.  you can go to Planned Parenthood to get tested. They offer the Womens Health Program, which makes your visits free. They also will not tell your parents you went there. Everything they do is confidential. I don't think you're pregnant but it's good to get a check up and possible find out if something else is wrong.|`|NSgjTgOmaa	OFF COURSE YOU ARENT! <br>  <br>  sometimes is all in your mind and you start eating more than what you need, and as a teenager your period sometimes is late.. Mine was like like 5 months and I am not pregnant, i didnt toke anything.
6NS3UUaQaa	I have to agree but another great cute moment my daughter gave me was.... One day she was just sitting on the couch watching T.V and I went to sit next to her she turned to me and kissed me on the arm and then just turned back around. It was the most precious thing ever she was about a 1 1/2 when she did that. She is 2 1/2 now. Kids are  great!!!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	well def when she was born but when i saw her smile at me  for the very first time it just made me feel so happy.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I have to agree with you!|`|e1oky4jSaa	I love when she was born, but I also loved when she told me that she was "proud of me" for decorating such a nice christmas tree. And also when she tells me she loves me, that makes me happy.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Definitly being born but also I LOVE when she gives me huge hugs in the morning and pats my back while doing it LOL...she's so freaken cute!|`|14JQ11AUaa	When we met for the first time :) Then when I was able to make him laugh and giggle for the first time....so darn precious!|`|dK17K1vMaa	I have to agree.  My favorite memory of my children are when they were born.  My fav now would be the random kisses and I love you's.  I have 3 children...almost 6 yr old Emmy, 3 yr old Kyler, and 7 month old Abby.  Abby can't say much but I love it when she smiles and sticks her tongue out...it's just so cute!  My 3 yr old is autistic and he just randomly comes up and gives Abby little kisses on her forehead.  It's absolutely amazing!  I just love my children so much!
eTx3Nfd7aa	yes you prob wont get strong constant movement till you are about 20-22 weeks.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	yes very normal darling<br>  it is very earlier darling. From 20 weeks it is good to check for movements. But baby is still developing and small at this time. so its normal to have baby move alot one day and the next not alot - as they most likely changed position. where ever they like and feel comfortable they go ;) From 24 weeks a chart for movements can be recorded.<br>  <br>  Stay strong darling x Baby is okay.<br>  god bless x very normal|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Your baby is still verry small, its normal not to feel regular movements at this stage - especially if you are active|`|JExgGpgyaa	Yeah, I didn't start feeling my baba every day until I was about 21 weeks or something.<br>  Even some times now he has lazy days where he doesn't move so much.<br>  <br>  At 15 weeks your bub still has LOADS of room to move about, so you won't feel every movement.<br>  <br>  I remember when I went for my 20 week ultrasound, and he was moving loads on screen but I couldn't feel any of them.|`|xocIN0scaa	yes.. they can be very sporadic until almost your third trimester. Very normal..dont be alarmed.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	yea  dey do that alot but wen you get to 23weeks little things will make move alot
32zBW5uCaa	Give her some bread slices, some soft margarine, a dull knife and tell her you need her to butter the bread.<br>  <br>  A plastic bowl, some peanut butter and jelly, a wooden spoon and let her mix it.<br>  <br>  A cup of yogurt with fruit, let her stir it.<br>  <br>  Some potatoes and a veggie brush.<br>  <br>  You need not eat any of her efforts, but she can sit on the floor, away from the stove and feel like she is helping.  Of course, at 19 months, her attention span is short, so you may have to find other ways to keep her busy.|`|NobHLAowaa	How about getting her a seat that won't slide around on the counter and give her some "ingredients" in a bowl to "mix up" ?|`|TuIrAXLkaa	I used to do that do. you just haft to distract her with something else give her a special project to do for you on the floor to make her feel important|`|h6NqNzHAaa	She can serenade you with pots/pans and wooden spoons on the floor while you cook.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	give her an empty bowl and spoon and ask her to mix her special spices for the meal
q0JTN9QAaa	My son likes to sleep oposite the way I try to get him to as well.  She is probably just lazy about building those neck musels up.  They do it at there own pace.  Just give her more floor time.<br>  <br>  If you want to see if she is slow or something does she return smiles, laugh when you laugh.  Maybe try and look when her name is called.<br>  <br>  www.pbs.org/parents  <br>  <br>  This site has a growth development chart that will let you know if she is going too slow or not.|`|hvjWpq2naa	It surely cant hurt to call your pediatrician and ask these questions. your pediatrician will counter with some questions of his/her own that you did not think of, either way you will be reassured your baby is developing normally or you will get to the bottom of it.  I would call.
433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Fraternal twins usually run along the female side of the family so your grandfather has has little, if anything, to do with it. (unless he's your mother's father, in which case your odds may be slightly higher). Identical twins have nothing to do with genetics, it's just down to luck. An egg splitting into two. Twins can skip a generation in many cases though.|`|AA11678263	Identical twins are not dictated by genetics - they occur spontaenously.  Fraternal twins (non-identical) are dictated by the females in the family as the females release two eggs per month instead of one.  Twins can skip generations, but in my family they are every generation.  My nan was a twin but her twin died when they were little, my mum was a twin but her twin was miscarried, and my brithers are twins.  It is highly likely that I will have twins, as may my sister.  Your paternal grandfather being a twin is unlikely to affect your odds, but a maternal one might.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I don't think so. Because it runs through the mother. <br>  So if your gran, your mother, sister, or aunt has had twins - then you're more likely to. <br>  It's pretty much a "gene" that makes you give out more eggs each month - thus more likely to end up with fraternal twins.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You chances are only slightly higher than a person who doesn't have a history of twin births in the family. It's not something you can pin down and say for sure yes or no you will or will not have twins.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	I am a father of twin girls. They were born 3 generations after twins on my wifes side of the family.  I suppose some families can have twins every other generation and others every 3rd. generation.
YmEGCGtnaa	many things usually or sometimes just one thing<br>  here's a list of many reasons:<br>  <br>  pre-eclampsia---a dangerous condition for mom and baby so mom needs to be induced early thus baby born early preemie<br>  <br>  other conditions or infections which would require induction early<br>  <br>  cervical incompetence---the cervix dialating very early in the pregnancy like at 22 weeks<br>  <br>  problems with the placenta such as placental abruption which it tears from the uterus or placenta previa <br>  <br>  or another placental problem: inefficient placenta which the nutrients are not being sufficiently transferred to the baby, resulting in  intra-uterine growth restriciton, which would require induction. <br>  <br>  physical trauma (like car accident, major fall, etc.)<br>  <br>  stress (SEVERE) <br>  <br>  smoking cigarettes, taking illiciit drugs, drinking amounts of alcohol, and even too much caffeine (like 500 mg plus) can increase the risk of preterm labor. Also getting major dental work done (which is why many dentist wont do major work on a  pregnant woman til she is full-term with dr.s permission).|`|bspRfskYaa	Sometimes its unexplained, sometimes its due to the mother having a weak cervix or infection.  Some people are more at risk than others so its hard to say exactly what it was in your case.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	My son was 1lb 8oz. I am glad to see that you are ok. I am very worried about my son. Any way my placenta tore away from my uterus. It was totally unexpected. Sometimes, theres no reason and theres nothing you can do about it.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I just went off of the same pill, Lo-Estrin 24 works differently than other pills because you only take four placebo pills, therefore most women on it have monthly periods only lasting three to five days. Once you start the next month of active pills your period will stop whether there is any tissue left or not. You probably aren't pregnant, but take a test to be sure.|`|GLJkGgloaa	I was on Loestrin and got Pregnant, 3 cycles after getting off Loestrin.<br>  So it's very possible.|`|WUt0jsujaa	I hated loestrin i went for 8 months without a period! It slowly just went away. If you take your pills every day at the same time and don't miss any then you should not get pregnant the chances are very slim. If you miss a pill do not have unprotected sex for a week follow the directions. But anyway if you are late take a test but the loestrin for me made me not get my period at all.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	I got pregnant on Loestrin 24 fe. I also misc carried

1YdeUn1Caa	My father smoked 3 packs a day around my sister and I, plus we had 3 grandparents smoke around us too. We turned out normal healthy kids. Don't listen to the lab rats or the non smokers. They're just paranoid.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	No I would not! I would've said she wasn't allowed to watch him again. Smoking round children is disgusting in my opinion.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	No, I wouldn't let them, if I was there I would take the baby elsewhere while they were smoking/the room was smoky. Why didn't she just go outside or something if there was a baby in the house? I used to smoke and would never think of smoking around a baby or a child. Even if it was my house, I would go outside to do it. That's just common sense and decency.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I wouldn't even let a child in a house where people smoked. Your brother and sister in law need some basic lessons in health. Yes, second hand smoke will hurt your baby. Studies say that people inhaling second hand smoke are getting more chemicals and carcinogens than the smoker. It can cause asthma, lung disease, pleurisy and lung cancer. I would have absolutely gone ballistic on them!|`|85V6cHe4aa	Oh i would have gone crazy!!! Yes its her house but the baby's health comes first and its incredibly selfish to take those risks.<br>  <br>  Don't let her babysit again,i wouldnt trust her-its very harmful as you know,no way have i ever let anyone smoke near my babies.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	no i would not, sorry, after i had done my very best during pregnancy to keep my baby healthy, im not going to let someone smoke around my baby|`|msNXomjTaa	My house is smoke free.  I would never allow my daughter to be babysat in a smoking home.  Period.|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	I wouldn't let her babysit again. But then, if you know she's a smoker, why did you leave your baby at her house on the first place? Even if she's smoking outside while your baby is there, that house must be full of nasty smoke residue all in the air. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think it was very rude of her. However, I'm sure your baby is ok. Better just to let it go, but not have her babysit again.|`|k32ktOLmaa	it DOES affect the baby, A LOT, they did an experiment monitoring the baby's heart rate while someone was smoking in the rOOM and it showed that the baby's heart rate increases in the prescence of smoke. <br>  <br>  <br>  i used to smoke and when i see people walking by with their babies or toddlers i would step far away from them. <br>  <br>  if i were you i would just not bring the baby to her next time and spend some money to find a baby sitter (not a teenager!!)   it might cost a bit of money but i think money is worth the safety of your baby..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|v9rzGYWoaa	I stopped smokeing when i found out I was pregnant my baby is 3now and I dont smoke around her. Dont let them baby sit if they cant respect that you dont want your baby smoked around. My baby is only exposed to smoke from the kitchen (tend to burn things) and thats it|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	I would have said it's my baby's health.  That is so stupid of her to respond like that.  Here in TX they banded smoking in local restaurants because of second hand smoke.  It is very bad for your baby.  Take the baby somewhere else!!!|`|VsSI1Rc9aa	do not let her smoke around your baby.<br>  just find another baby sitter on google or ask your friends<br>  so not let her smoke around it for sure it will be soooo bad for it|`|ZA18KoC9aa	i would have said no- smoking is bad for everyone including small children!|`|FJswVeqbaa	no way....hell no|`|QSL8kwzXaa	No way. Smoking is terrible for you and the people you are around. Scientists have studied firsthand and secondhand smoke and have come to find that, yes indeed, such a thing as thirdhand smoke exists. Thirdhand smoke is the residue left on furniture, carpeting, walls, etc. after a person smokes in that particular area. As you might know, babies love to touch anything they can get their hands on, so having a baby crawling all over a floor and touching things that have been exposed to cigarette smoke will put them at major risk for thirdhand smoke, consequently putting them at major risk for cancer and other diseases. So putting this simpler - don't let her babysit period if she's just going to be smoking inside the house, even when the baby is away.|`|LOat20Hmaa	Its OK to not want someone to smoke around your baby. I do see her point however, its your responsibility to choose a babysitter. If the babysitter comes to your home than its okay to ask her to stop, but if its at her house it might not be okay. My suggestions are to cut her wage, have her come to your home or just find a new one.|`|Ev9Rnm0Xaa	i would say your sister in law is selfish and that regardless of whether its her house or not,thats your baby and in comitting herself to babysitting she is accepting responsibility for his safety and welbeing and smoking isnt really going to be doing the kids lungs much good.|`|WTFkqS3daa	Well, that's YOUR baby. You tell her that, smoking around your baby is a big NO NO !!! And sorry to tell you that, but your brother seems to be a bit insensitive. Of course it's gonna affect your baby's small and fragile lungs !! Come on, that's obvious ! What's wrong with your brother ?|`|8c1543nUaa	Find another sitter. That's so bad for babies. She's so inconsiderate if she doesn't care.|`|S8WzMBFiaa	No, i dont want my baby to smoke (its called passive smoking i think)

Seriously, 8 out of the 9 under age 7 were products of the pull out method. Mine will be the 2nd one in 7 years (out of 10 kids now) that wasn't. Honestly, your odds depend on if you were ovulating.

Ya, we did it for a while and nothing happened, so I'm thinking, THIS IS LIKE BIRTH CONTROL. Little did i know, it got me pregnant. Not once did he ever "cumed" inside me. I am now 23 weeks pregnant. Really be careful. The more you do the pull out method increases your chance of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  If you only done it once, i wouldn't worry as much. But just keep in mind that you can still get pregnant. Be safe :]|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	alot of this answer will come down to your cycle... have u ovulated already... try doing some calculations etc... it really is a risk take and not  the best option. if you are not ready for kids for yours and the life of an unwanted child, go on birth control. hope everything works out the way you want it too. good luck! xxx|`|GJb2OSrnaa	ur chances are stilll the same as unprotected staying in method<br>  <br>  <br>  u know not all the C*m exits at ejaculation, there's sum during intercourse too<br>  <br>  <br>  DEE DA DEE<br>  <br>  if ur that naive bout getting pregers, hope u do, use contraception....|`|sjUNb9zXaa	If you have to use the pull out method,then you should not be having sex,condoms,birth control or abstinence could have possibly doubted your worries.|`|AA10327722	The same as if he went in you.  You can get pregnant off pre *** too.  Wear protection or get birth control next time.|`|hzWtMS3zaa	The "pull out" method is nearly guaranteed to fail<br>  If any of the sperm even gets near your opening, you can still get pregnant. It only takes one little cell to fertilize the egg.<br>  <br>  I suggest you wait about a week and then take a pregnancy test. The longer you wait, the clearer the results. <br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, I wish you the best of luck!|`|A5D62Ycbaa	There's every chance.  As it was this weekend go and get emergency contreception.  You can take the "morning after" pill up to 72 hours after sex, although the longer you leave it the less effective it is.  So if you're in the UK and everywhere is shut - get yourself to the nearest A&E now - you can get it there free!|`|BilLTGLFaa	Yes yes yes you CAN get pregnant! I am currently pregnant from the pull-out "method", which is not really a method at all, it's a gamble. If you don't want to get pregnant, be smart and use a condom and get on birth control.|`|mp3TXe5daa	If you have sex you can get pregnant no matter what! The pull out method does not work, he has pre ejaculate that is loaded with sperm.|`|aYlXO4wCaa	The pullout method is no guarantee <br>  It worked for me and my man for about 1 and a half year then we conceived  our daughter.|`|hIzQyflqaa	that method is stupid, use contraception!|`|LBfD7tbHaa	Not safe use condoms it work if use with care ..........|`|xqqYXUNHaa	That's my method and I'm almost 5 weeks pregnant... It doesn't work every month ...
