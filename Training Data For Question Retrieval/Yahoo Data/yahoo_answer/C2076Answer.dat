Rate the answer 1-5 stars, add a comment if you wish, click submit, you're done. 3 points back.<br>  <br>  For undecided questions.<br>  ===================<br>  Click "VOTE" on any Category. Pick a question, click on the question to open it. Select the answer you think is best. Click on "Vote as Best Answer". You have gained 1 point.|`|3cnGPqt3aa	Do you mean,"How do I choose best answer to one of my questions"?<br>  <br>  Just in case that's what you mean, <br>  After you have asked a question, wait at least four hours, then go back to your question, you will see that underneath all the answers there is a blue tab.  Click the one under the answer you like the best:)<br>  <br>  Above advise about giving best answers is very good:)|`|Xsmkzs9Caa	Here are some tips I find work for me.<br>  <br>  - Only answer questions you know you have the correct answer to.<br>  - Answer questions in the subjects/catagories you feel confident about.<br>  - Relate the subject matter to the person your talking to. <br>  - Don't be judgemental of anyone in your answers.<br>  - Avoid words like No, Don't, Shouldn't, etc. Replace with 'Try to  avoid', 'Consider doing xyz instead'. Negative connotations sway peoples minds into picking someone else.<br>  - Web search the persons question to see if theres helpful webpages, and information to help them.<br>  - Stay positive.<br>  <br>  Hope some of this helps you in your pursuit of getting right answers. Best of luck!|`|MtDMzSQjaa	By keeping quiet|`|AA10289152	Just answer the question Straight..short and clear..
z5fFoTMBaa	This has happened before to my email account a couple of years back. I just waited but forgot how long it took. I don't remember if it went for days, but it was a long wait.

c8DjmWXxaa	nothing is wrong, it's just that your taking too long to choose a best answer, so yahoo gets other people to do it for it you, i always pick best answer the following day,<br>  if you havent picked a best answer after 3 or maybe 4 days then you loose the right to pick and yahoo puts it to the vote, so if you want to pick top answers then do it between 5 and 24 hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  10 points please thank you  lol :)|`|Gd6bmn5Gaa	u have to wait 5 hours to pick best answer i think|`|SFzsT2sqaa	wait four hours and you'll be able to do it.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	The way it is  if you don't take the opportunity to pick best answer it  is thrown out for a panel to vote.|`|3cnGPqt3aa	Wait at least four hours and it should work, if not then it must be a problem with Yahoo:(<br>  <br>  If you leave it more than three days, it will automatically go to voting.

YQOiQLGGaa	=O the red ring of death!! I had that once. <br>  and i think you should phone up the xbox people to fix it. or the place where you bought it from. is it new/fairly new? or have you had it for years (as in has the warranty run out?)|`|MyuexdrYaa	ok. check your wires make shure there in nice and tight. also make shure your xbox is in an area that there is air and that it cannot over heat. next try your other games does it do this for every game. If not then you have to erase all your files off your hard drive just for that game. I had this problem about last month ago. It only did this when i played NBA live. Good Luck|`|2Z4G7aXZaa	Simple answer is to get a cooling fan $30 from you nearest game store.<br>  <br>  If its not overheating you could always try downloading the latest update to NXE
WiXVQEPjaa	Well i wouldnt put up wih that, here take this lead bar and go sort it out, i shall be waiting outside with the car running, :)|`|suPD7c3gaa	It was probably reported because someone thought that answer was a criticism of the question or the person asking the question.  My guess it was someone who didn't even answer, and not the asker.  The REAL problem here is in answering a question that itself is a violation, which that question was.  It's just risky answering those types of questions.  Other than having used up another 5 points just to ask about it, when there was nothing more you could do about it, you can make up those points pretty quickly with answer 3 questions, and voting a question that's in voting.|`|673739cc8cf9ce9f1a5e007efbd067bcaa	Your answer was a violation for chatting. Yahoo wants this site to be for knowledgeable  questions and answers. Questions/answers that you would be the only person to benefit from the answers is considered chatting and not allowed. The question should have been deleted for chatting.  Hope this helps!!!|`|dnG7fhnbaa	It would have been some bored prat who reported you and Y!A wouldn't have read the Q, just your answer...as it doesn't look like a real answer you lost the appeal...I've had loads of perfectly normal Qs and answers removed. :o||`|4EZcG3YSaa	it certainly is, it makes you wonder why we bother!<br>  good morning BTW *blatantly chats*|`|wZAl2zmEaa	the only thing i can think of is that you had "lol" and the person only wanted one word, but that's REALLY scraping the bottom of the barrel for a reason there.|`|SEi4V7eKaa	You may have answered a totally different question, they got mad, followed you to a different answer and reported you. What jerks!|`|a268f9d3496f5966f7a0d59105ab21b1aa	I agree with you you show as quite obnoxious and you should not have been found guilty of whatever rule you are accused of breaking but then again there are sensitive questioners out there who couldn't have a laugh if you paid them ~~|`|CHCPnvksaa	Wow Y! A is pretty retarded, especially if you were calling yourself obnoxious and not the asker. I would try to appeal it again, if that's even possible
jfOSVSQkaa	I would make live chat available for all people asking and answering questions, just like they're discussing stuff in person.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	I would make it so that YA remembered questions I had already visited. That way when I click 'show me another' I get a question I have not already answered.
thW6k4zXaa	I would have different age groups so that 40 yr olds aren't giving advice to 12 year olds. And the other way around as well.  I would also have a real security system.  My question was deleted once because I asked if there were any parents in Florida that had children with Tourretts' Syndrome.  My son has TS and I guess they felt that I wasn't asking a true question.  I was really upset about that because there was a question about if anyone thought that Pres. Obamah felt that his life was in jeopordy and they didn't delete that question.   I think there is a way you can search through your previous answers and questions in your profile.|`|b4d913ee65061c6a12e7e513f4adca24aa	I would have someone on the Site to check things before they Are posted or before the answer is posted as to STOP some of the RUDE answers and some of the PROFANITY or just out right nasty answers that people give. Then we would not have to report the ones we feel are rude or just outright nasty.|`|KN36rGMvaa	I would get rid of the reporting system. It's pathetic.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  -Will
KN36rGMvaa	When you pick best answer you can leave a comment.<br>  If they allow IM or Email you can send them comments that way.<br>  You can leave a comment on your question by clicking on details but you have to be careful because your question can be deleted for chatting.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  -Will

It says the image dimensions are 26px × 190px (scaled to 48px × 351px). You will need to definitely increase the width dimension of your image -- something between 100px and 200px will help. Perhaps you might want to cut back on the height of the image as well.

Xg8Tzjfraa	Never make assumption based on information you find on the internet. And I do believe that if anyone goes to www.yahoo.fr, they can sign up for an email address there too.      Even if not, it would be a poor assumption to make.|`|AA12236042	No.  Could be in any part of the world.  To get a .fr, you go to Yahoo France and register and you will have .fr at the end of your email.

Don't trust anything from there, if it shows up there without you sending them a spam violation it means that they already have an extremely low rating and possibly a violation. The only reason they are allowed to keep up a site is because they use a free host and those are usually not checked by anyone.

I think that the voting list may be sorted by the time left to answer and then, if no time left to answer, by date submitted. <br>  You could try the theory out with this question.<br>  <br>  A tiebreaker will stay as a tiebreaker until someone votes on the question and breaks the tie.<br>  <br>  You can sort the unresolved questions out by reversing the date order and voting on the oldest questions first.

yhX02yuNaa	People are horrible and mean because they're anonymous on here.  If they're having a bad day they can "kick the dog" on Y/A and nobody in their home knows about it.  <br>  <br>  I agree with your assessment that most answers are meaningless.  Some people seem to read just the "title" of the question and reply to that, which is meaningless most of the time.  <br>  <br>  I guess it's better if they're mean and stupid on here instead of being mean to their families.  Just don't take the stupidity personally.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	They find it easy to hide behind their computer because they know there is a very low, if any, chance of a face-to-face confrontation.|`|NEkXzGQoaa	Urgh, I know hey.<br>  I posted a question asking what people thought of my poetry, and all I got was rude remarks about one misspelled word.<br>  So many people here are full of sh*t.<br>  Oh well, its the internet I guess; people can say whatever the hell they want behind the safety of their own computer.|`|VmE0jG0Eaa	You should consider writing better questions.<br>  <br>  You know, questions that are better than, for example, THIS question.<br>  <br>  I question that can actually be answered.

ncCWnApDaa	RAMO(report and move on), that is the only way to get rid of trolls, by answering them you are doing what they want giving them the attention they crave, they like nothing more than to get angry replies, they get a kick out of it, so as I said RAMO.<br>  <br>  As for shutting down categories that may remove the section but it does not remove the trolls, they would simply find other areas to continue posting their nonsense.

03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Go figure.  When someone doesn't like your answer they can report it and usually the Answers team allows it.  It's happened to me several times.  Yesterday someone wrote something really nasty about "Hussein Obama"; I said I didn't know who Hussein Obama is, got reported and it was still called a violation.|`|GpbYrDU6aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Somebody obviously saw that answer as rasict, and reported it, but nobody can really answer why but yourself or the person that reported you.<br>  <br>  <br>  You didn't say what your "mildly comical" answer was, but if it was something that maybe could have been offensive, then, yes, it was reported for being "rasict."<br>  <br>  <br>  In future, I don't recommend going on any topics like that again and replying, to engage your chances of being deleted further, but obviously Yahoo! or whoever reported you did not understand you weren't meaning to be offensive.<br>  <br>  <br>  I can't really say why your answer was reported, unless you tell us what you've said in the answer, it's up to you to decide why.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, you know you're a nicer person than that and didn't mean it, so why are you fussing about it? Don't bother worrying and getting annoyed about something that was basically a pure mistake, if you meant what you said to be offensive then, yes, you were rude. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you didn't, just forget it! It's not worth worrying about if you know you're a nice person! :D|`|AA11252878	To tell you the truth, it was not a very good idea to answer a question like that. Your answer has definitely angered another user and caused you to be reported by the Answers community. Now you should see why that happened. The only thing you should have done was not answer the question, but reported it to the Y!A Team. Just let them take care of the problem and you just move on. Remember the credo here: RAMO-report and move on.<br>  <br>  Even though this may be a joke to you, it has gotten you into a lot of trouble in the process. I strongly suggest you lay off the sarcasm before you risk getting your Answers account permanently suspended. The joke's over, so cut it out. There's already a lot of extremely touchy users on this site, so be very mindful on what you say here. One slip of the tongue and they will report you in an instant.<br>  <br>  Here's more information on what I'm saying:<br>  <br>  One last thing, if you discover a violation and “call out” the abusive post or member, you become part of the problem. It may be tempting to leave an insult or “reported”; however, it’s not an answer and it’s against the Community Guidelines. Take the high road on this one—just report it and leave it at that.|`|nOVSf06Raa	If you see questions that are not of your liking avoid answering them and  remember that not everyone on here takes a joke or humour and there are times that some of them are instigators and do it on purpose just to report others , so to be safe and avoid trolls put your profile and Q&A private  and only answer giving an answer to the question and nothing more .|`|aLZoP73Laa	I think I know which question you're on about! Something to do with feeling lonely. I didn't answer the question because I didn't know whether it was taking the mickey or being serious.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	But you admit to violating the guidelines so getting the notice should not have surprised you.  If you did not like the question you had two options.  Report it or ignore it.|`|AA11408911	Without knowing the full answer users shall be unable to fully comments on the reason your answer was removed, however from the information provided I would have to assume your answer was reported for chatting, and not for being a topic of a hateful nature.<br>  <br>  If you wish to update this question with the rough contents of the answer removed, a more accurate reason could be established. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, if you disagree with the violation, you are entitled to an appeal at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/first_appeal.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a><br>  <br>  If you were sent a violation notice, ensure to include the violation notice reference, a long string of letters and numbers found in the violation email subject line, within the additional information box.<br>  <br>  [ Thanks for the update ]<br>  <br>  Your answer would have been removed for insulting a user, regardless of the nature of the question.

Here are some tips on how to make it noticeable:<br>  <br>  <br>  1 - Write in Caps, for example: HELP!<br>  <br>  <br>  2 - Choose your question to go into a section where you know there are good answers available to help you.<br>  <br>  <br>  3 - Use a wide range of punctuation, like: I NEED HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  4 - Make an interesting title. Things like "Help" or "AHHHH" aren't really exiting, state what your problem is, so people that are interested in your situation will come.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't think people "don't answer your questions", maybe they just cant? Sometimes things are too hard we all end up clicking off them, or maybe confusing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Keep it simple what you write inside, and not too long. People want to be able to read it and relate to your problem, not sit around for 10 minutes reading information, simple vocabulary may be helpful, if it is possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also try doing it at a time of day when most people will be online, like 3.00pm, not 7.00am, when hardly anybody will be online. Hopefully this will help people and attract them to come to your questions.|`|wSucHwmCaa	samee heree;<br>  But make sure you title is appeling so peopel look at it and think they can answer it, and use supportive details!

gGZz2EGyaa	I think the whole point of Yahoo Answers is to find the best answer not the worse.  I suppose if you think that the answer given to a question is incorrect then you could always use the thumbs down.  The other answerer's to the question will always add a note in their answer to say that they think so and so has answered incorrectly.<br>  To have votes on the worst answers I think you would need another site for that perhaps they could call it Yahoo Answers 2 or something similar like your encyclopedia blog.

1hciyvKdaa	You gotta hope someone else bids or hurry email the seller, they do not have to help you, they may have to wait until the end, if you win, offer to pay the start up fees x 2 for the new ad they would have to pay instead of the winning auction bid, they may say yes, they may not even respond, if they say no or do not respond you must purchase. Turn around and list it for sale yourself on Ebay once you recieve the item. You will already have all the packaging so you wont lose money buying that.|`|suPD7c3gaa	You can not retract a bid.  That's why you have to be very careful and sure you want to bid. Get shipping information and any other conditions, ask questions of the Seller if necessary, and research the product... BEFORE placing a bid.

IzCCoKNoaa	Before going to your intended size, you first want to crop your image to remove any unnecessary portions of the picture. After cropping, you can change the overall pixel dimensions to go even smaller. <br>  All photo editing software will have a command for changing the pixel dimensions of an image. Look for a command called "Image Size," "Resize," or "Resample." When you use this command you will be presented with a dialog box for entering the exact pixels you wish to use. Other options you may find in the dialog are: <br>  <br>  Resample - You need this on when sizing down. This enables the software to change the pixel dimensions. <br>  Constrain proportions or keep aspect ratio - You want this option enabled. It prevents the image from being stretched and distorted. When this option is enabled, you only need to enter one value--height or width--and the other value will adjust automatically.<br>  Never, ever resize and overwrite your original file!<br>  After sizing the image, be sure to do a Save As so you don't overwrite your original, high resolution file. You'll want to save as a JPEG file. <br>  <br>  When choosing the compression level, keep quality in the medium to high range. <br>  You want to shoot for a file size of 30 to 100 KB per image. Go small if you will be putting several files on the same page or sending them in one email. <br>  Try not to exceed 100 KB per Web page for the total of all images.<br>  This may sound like a time consuming process, especially if you have a lot of photos to share, but fortunately most of today's software has made it easy to size and compress a batch of photos very quickly. Most image management and some photo editing software has an "email photos" command that will resize and compress the images for you. In fact, Windows XP and Windows Vista both have this functionality built-in. Some software can even resize, compress, and generate complete photo galleries for posting on the Web. And there are specialized tools for both of these tasks--many of them free software.<br>  <a href="http://graphicssoft.about.com/cs/digitalimaging/f/howreducesize.htm" rel="nofollow">http://graphicssoft.about.com/cs/digital...</a>

If they have the right to use your info, however, there really isn't anything you can do.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Probably not.  Most competitions in the rules say that anything you send them, belongs to them and you give them the right to use it as they please.  I would be very surprised if that was not the case.  The only exceptions I have seen is for young kids <12 years old.  So when you enter contests, you better read the fine print.  E-mailing them is not going to help.

9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history.

It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail.

ncCWnApDaa	It can actually depend on the level of the user a level 1 or 2 user will usually be removed almost immediately, while a level 6 or 7 user their content could stay up for 24 hours no matter how blatantly it violates the rules.<br>  <br>  Yahoo has not officially written anywhere that I know of which states violations from a higher level user take longer to be removed, but personal experience on this site has convinced me this is correct, yahoo don't let us know how TC badges are awarded either, but after a while we can pretty much figure most of it out.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying the higher your level the greater your report power, I don't think that is true, what I'm saying is the higher your level the greater your immunity is from reports, they will still be dealt with but just seem to take longer to be rid of, which I don't think is 100% fair since level is obviously no indication of conduct, there are level 1 & 2 users that all act well within the guidelines, while there are level 6 & 7 users who will frequently violate the rules.|`|AA11408911	Community moderation is slightly more complex than simply requiring two people to report content to merit its removal. Every member of the community is assigned a trust level. While this trust level is unknown to users, it is based primarily on the accuracy of reports made by that user on previous violations. Community moderation requires at least two trusted members to report content before it is removed. Therefore it could be a case that the users who reported such content as well as yourself have yet to establish a high trust rating. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, it is believed that resolved content requires more reports of abuse compared to unresolved content. In addition to the reporter's trust level, should the author of the content that you reported have a very high trust level as well, it will require more votes of abuse to have the content removed. <br>  <br>  Essentially if you see content that violates either the community guidelines or terms of conditions, ensure to report such content. If other users report this content is shall be removed and aid your reporting trust level. If content is not removed instantly, it shall still be reviewed by a member of the customer care team and could still be removed from the community. <br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|zDQIPFH2aa	It is more complicated than just two people reporting. However, there are glitches in the system. For example, I have almost 1000 questions I have reported that have been immunized and no matter how many good reporters report them, they will not be removed. These glitches apparently allow reports to be reported on the user end, but they never record on YA's end as a report. With things like "Am I pretty?" questions, 19 of 20 will be removed quickly, but that last one just gets stuck. I have even seen "How to build a bomb?" questions that could not be removed.<br>  <br>  A couple of tips. Always get all the reports in while the question is young. If reports straddle the BA being picked or going to vote, it seems to be a glitch time. The same is true if you straddle a question in voting versus resolved. Also remember to vote NBA on questions you report. That will sometimes help get them removed.|`|thW6k4zXaa	It takes a person like me...an innocent mother of a child with Tourretts' syndrome to ask if there are any parents in Florida with children with TS and what kind of tics are they having.

Some cell phones have voice recorders, or they're very cheap in the store. If you don't mean singing, no matter how bad you think your voice is it's not a very big deal and others probably don't notice. Learn to love yourself. Singing is another story, there's just some ppl that should take classes, and others that just shouldn't sing....

9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. If all else fails go back to classic mail  Hope this helps.

7u77AiBjaa	What is "best" depends on how you are going to use the blog and other preferences.<br>  <br>  I can tell you what services are popular. Wordpress is at the top of the list for people who run a web site and want to incorporate blogging or who want to do "multi-user blogging". Blogger is at the top of the list for people who would rather have a service control the primary web site functions and provide automated tools/features (i.e. developer-hosted blogging). Wordpress can also be used as a developer host.<br>  <br>  Investigate the following free services. Pick one service, register if necessary, and start writing a blog entry through their web site.<br>  <br>  Blogger/Blogspot (<a href="http://blogger.com" rel="nofollow">http://blogger.com</a> ), Wordpress (<a href="http://wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://wordpress.com</a> ), Livejournal (<a href="http://livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">http://livejournal.com</a> ), Vox (<a href="http://vox.com" rel="nofollow">http://vox.com</a> ), Yahoo! Shine (<a href="http://shine.yahoo.com">http://shine.yahoo.com</a> )<br>  <br>  You may want to check out <a href="http://blog-services-review.toptenreviews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://blog-services-review.toptenreview...</a> , which provides a listing of top blogging services and features.<br>  <br>  NOTE: There is a distinction between blogging services and those more for social networking (but have a blogging component). Social-networking would include Yahoo! 360, Facebook, and MySpace. They have features that extend beyond just blogging and are geared toward connecting with other profiles.|`|jANUq4SPaa	Well, the one I use is <a href="http://www.l0lz.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.l0lz.com.</a>  I have a couple commercial blogs there and an individual blog as well.

9BL6LFJ9aa	S orry but they are not OK. I just looked at your questions, They are almost all chatting in Yahoos terms. A question must give an answer which is useful and adds knowledge to All members. Your questions are only useful to yourself. Sorry but that is the rule and if you carry on you may get suspended.Please read Yahoo TOS.<br>  Good luck and be careful|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Anytime your question seeks our personal opinions, such as Does this girl like me. you are chatting.  That is a violation.<br>  Suggest you read the guidelines.  The rules state a question must seek knowledge or advice beneficial to all.  What a girl thinks about you benefit no one but you.  Some other member put it simple, anytime the word YOU is in a question it is chatting.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Questions are removed due to reports by users. Users may have a different viewpoint of what is breaking the rules than you do. The most common reason for violations seems to be 'chatting'. If your questions are not 'serious' and are for chatting purposes only, they will get reported and removed.

suPD7c3gaa	You don't make suggestions here.  There's a forum for that and the link is above on the upper right of the page. You HAVE to ask questions here.  But I have a question for you.  What if the person doesn't want people to know their location?  Sometimes that's the case.  Do you really think Yahoo! is just going to give out that information?  That's personal and sometimes private.  If you want that information about someone you're chatting with... ASK THEM YOURSELF!!  I'm just telling you this so you don't waste your time putting your suggestion on the forum.  Otherwise... good luck not getting this post reported.  It's a violation... you haven't asked a question.
8NTXSKRiaa	I know mine was also deleted n it was neither inappropriate nor offensive. I think it might be becuase many people have taken offense to the question (wu eva those losers were) or like the chick above they might think it is just stupid or wasteful question (which i don't agree becuase most of the question on Yahoo are actually stupid and random that many people wouldn't ask in person to anyone..)|`|nJs0UBDraa	I think this one will be deleted too!!|`|GpbYrDU6aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Questions can be deleted if they are considered "chatting" (Like "Oh, hi!

If you need help with an income those sites can help you. On the counseling thing I am not sure about.
suPD7c3gaa	Call the company that provides the service and ask them.  They'd probably know. The phone is probably stolen though... that would be my guess. If you're going to risk calling them, I wouldn't use that phone to do it..  They may want to deactivate it while you're on the phone with them.  I would think, considering you bought it in a pawn shop, that it probably IS stolen.  So you can either take a chance and call them, or take the loss and destroy and toss the phone.  If it was stolen, you could be charged with the crime if it was reported.  Why on earth would you buy something like that from a pawn shop?|`|gsBkLXUzaa	You bought a phone that is probably connected to an account that has an unpaid balance. Who is the service provider? i would call them and tell them that you bought a phone and it is still active and you want to terminate that account. Then just activate under your account<br>  <br>  eta: and if you bought the phone in good faith then NO you cannot be charged for the crime. They may take the phone from you and return it to its rightful owner, though.
