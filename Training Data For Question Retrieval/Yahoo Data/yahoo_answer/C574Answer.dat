t4HLg1Rdaa	Las autoridades sanitarias de Estados Unidos dictaminó hoy que la circuncisión de varones adultos puede reducir en alrededor de un 50 por ciento el peligro de contraer el virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH) que causa el sida. EFE "La circuncisión masculina puede reducir el riesgo individual de infección y, ojalá, la propagación del VIH en toda la comunidad", dijo el director del Instituto Nacional de Alergia y Enfermedades Infecciosas, Anthony Fauci. <br>  <br>  El instituto forma parte de los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud, un organismo del Gobierno de Estados Unidos. <br>  <br>  La decisión se anunció tras el análisis de dos estudios realizados en áfrica sobre la relación de la circuncisión y la enfermedad. <br>  <br>  Ese vínculo había sido advertido en los últimos a?os del decenio de 1980, y las pruebas clínicas de 3.000 hombres en Suráfrica determinaron que la circuncisión prevenía los efectos del VIH en un 60 por ciento. <br>  <br>  La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) calcula que en el mundo hay alrededor de 40 millones de personas que sufren la infección del VIH. <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, Fauci advirtió en un comunicado de que la circuncisión no constituye una protección infalible contra el virus. <br>  <br>  Se?aló que los hombres, aunque estén circuncidados, deben continuar usando condón en sus relaciones sexuales. <br>  <br>  También se deben agotar todas las precauciones en otro tipo de actividades peligrosas, como en la inyección de drogas, manifestó. <br>  <br>  Fauci explicó que las células del prepucio del pene, que se eliminan mediante la circuncisión, son especialmente sensibles a la invasión del virus. <br>  <br>  Además, esa piel es mucho más frágil que la que le rodea, lo que facilita la penetración del virus en el sistema, se?aló. <br>  <br>  En los estudios, los científicos de los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud estudiaron los casos de 2.784 voluntarios en Kisumu (Kenia), que no estaban infectados con el virus, y los de 4.966 en la misma situación en Rakai (Uganda). <br>  <br>  Al cabo de dos a?os, los investigadores determinaron que 22 de los que se habían sometido a la circuncisión en Kenia habían contraído el virus en comparación con 47 no circuncidados, una reducción del 53 por ciento. <br>  <br>  En Uganda, los infectados con circuncisión fueron 22 contra 43 infectados sin circuncisión, una reducción de un 48 por ciento, según se?alaron. <br>  segun noticias difundidas eso es porque  debemos <br>  ser mas cauteloso  en eso..<br>  saludos<br>  de tu amigo<br>                       frank valentino>>>>>**|`|b1278547da41c5fd1e135989cb56153baa	De pretender hacer la circuncisión en masa, lo tendrán que planear muy bien , porque no es lo mismo, hacerlo en adultos que en bebes, es una operación quirúrgica que necesita su tiempo de recuperación , y el pos-operatorio bastante doloroso.<br>  <br>  <br>  La circuncisión también ofrece algún beneficio al prevenir al cáncer peneano en los varones adultos. Sin embargo, esta enfermedad es muy rara en todos los hombres, independientemente de que hayan o de que no hayan sido circuncidados. La circuncisión puede disminuir el riesgo de enfermedades transmitidas sexualmente. Las prácticas sexuales de un hombre (por ejemplo el uso de condón si tiene más de una compa?era, etc.) tiene más que ver con la prevención de las ETS que con el hecho de que el haya sido circuncidado o no.<br>  <br>  Los resultados de los estudios acerca de si la circuncisión puede ayudar a reducir el riesgo de cáncer cervical en las compa?eras sexuales femeninas, y también acerca de si ésta ayuda a prevenir ciertos problemas con el pene, tales como infecciones e hinchazón indeseada han sido mixtos. Algunos estudios muestran que mantener el pene limpio puede ayudar a prevenir estos problemas tan bien como la circuncisión. Las infecciones y la hinchazón indeseada no son algo grave y por lo general pueden ser tratados si es que ocurren.<br>  <br>  <<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>><br>  <br>  todo  lo que sea beneficio para la salud y para terminar con el tema del "Sida en Africa"<br>  ? es bienvenido!<br>  <br>  un besito ........<br>   y gracias por la información!

czY24Tjsaa	La ladilla es un parásito, sus huevos pueden verse en el pelo cerca de la piel, en la forma de peque?os puntos blancos pegados al pelo.Las ladillas se alimentan de sangre por lo menos dos veces al día, lo que ocasiona un prurito muy molesto que puede hacer que el infectado se rasque provocando irritación e infección de la piel.<br>  <br>  La transmisión se realiza en la mayoría de los casos por contacto sexual, aunque también en raras ocasiones puede suceder al usar prendas que han estado en contacto con algún portador. Además de la región púbica, también pueden situarse en el cabello, las cejas, las pesta?as y el vello axilar y corporal (de las piernas y los brazos, por ejemplo).Cualquiera puede contraer ladillas<br>  <br>  Existen cremas, shampoos y lociones que contienen hexacloruro de benceno gamma o permetrina. Aunque el parásito vive poco tiempo separado del cuerpo, es conveniente cambiar sábanas, toallas y ropas para evitar la reinfestación. no se van con el agua|`|2iVZawSTaa	las ladillas son paracitos muy parecidos a los piojos... se llaman tambien mariposas del amor porque son muy comun q se transmiten por relaciones sexuales.... suelen estar en vello pubico tambien en axilas cejas barba bigotes... el aspecto q tienen es como "cangrejitos" casusan mucha picazon una vez q ya te picaron... se reproducen bastante rapido y son dificiles de controlar.. debido a q perduran en las sabas o toallones por unas 24 hs espernado su proxima victima por asi decirlo....<br>  <br>  la maenra antigua era depilando mucho las partes...<br>  ba?andose no se van( no es una enfermedad de higene o estatus social)<br>  hoy por hoy en las farmacias se venden cremas q los matan <br>  <br>  <br>  estudio medicina 3 a?o y no hace mas de un mes me tomaron un examen q hubo preguntas de ese tema jajajaaj me fue bien.. saludos|`|7LsHNIhgaa	son como piojillos en la pubis y solo se quita retirando el bello ocon shampoo par ladillas ok y se pasan por tenr sexo con gente q las tienen|`|8435Gaesaa	Son como piojos para el vello pubico (normalmente).

You will think you are speaking and making sense but to those who you speak, you will get funny looks because you aren't making sense.  and the comment about not eating and your body storing up the fat is correct.

Se poi lui ti tocca tra le gambe, gli devi dire di no, perchè questo è un forno che brucia. è tutto chiaro ?"<br>  "Sì mamma!", risponde la figlia.<br>  Allora, quando lei rientra, la mamma è ancora sveglia che aspetta e le dice:<br>  "Allora com'è andata ?"<br>  "Ho seguito i tuoi consigli, mamma. Lui mi ha baciato ed io l'ho lasciato fare, mi ha accarezzato e l'ho lasciato fare, poi mi ha toccato il seno e gli ho detto di no perchè sono spine che pungono, poi mi ha toccato sotto e gli ho detto di no perchè è un forno che brucia."<br>  La mamma incuriosita: "E lui che ha fatto ?"<br>  La figlia: "Lui mi ha detto che aveva una salsiccia e mi ha chiesto di fargliela cuocere. Beh, sarà stato due ore a cuocerla, ma quando l'ho messa in bocca, era ancora cruda."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  C'e' un tipo che ha un pene lungo 60 cm. Disperato perche' la sua donna, dopo un'esperienza molto dolorosa, non vuole piu' far l'amore con lui, si reca dal medico e gli spiega il problema:<br>  "Dottore mi deve aiutare, ce l'ho lungo 60cm e la mia donna non vuole più fare l'amore con me".<br>  "Guardi", risponde il dottore, "mi spiace, ma non so come aiutarla".<br>  Tutto abbacchiato, il tipo esce dallo studio del medico e s'incammina verso casa. Mentre cammina, incontra una vecchietta, che vedendolo cosi' triste e preoccupato, gli si avvicina e gli chiede:<br>  "Giovanotto, cosa c'e' che non va ? Perche' sei cosi' triste?"<br>  Lui a quel punto, pur di sfogarsi con qualcuno, le spiega quale è il problema e lei gli fa:<br>  "Io ho la soluzione al tuo problema. Devi recarti allo stagno qui dietro e chiedere alla rana se vuole uscire a cena con te. Se ti risponde di no, il c...o ti si accorcera' di 10 cm".<br>  Scettico ma speranzoso, il tipo si dirige allo stagno, vede la rana, si china e le chiede:<br>  "Vuoi uscire a cena con me ?"<br>  e la rana: "No". Puff, come per incanto, gli diventa di 50cm. <br>  Il giorno dopo, si reca ancora allo stagno e chiede alla rana: "Vuoi uscire a cena con me ?"<br>  e la rana: "No". Istantaneamente gli si accorcia di altri 10 cm. diventando di 40 cm.<br>  Il giorno dopo, si reca di nuovo allo stagno e chiede alla rana: "Vuoi uscire a cena con me ?"<br>  e la rana: "No". TRAC.... 30 cm.<br>  Allora il tipo la sera stessa pensa: Ok ... adesso e' 30cm , ancora 10 cm. e poi sono a posto.<br>  Cosi', il giorno dopo, si reca per l'ultima volta allo stagno, vede la rana, si china e le chiede:<br>  "Vuoi uscire a cena con me ?"<br>  e la rana: "UFFFFFFFFFA...ti ho detto NO! NO! NO!"|`|734c9c60165e34de22e6039ada6cba71aa	pensa alle cose belle cha farai....|`|GjPF4fQVaa	idem, una camminata in solitaria è quello che potrebbe fare al caso, giusto per schiarirsi le idee|`|MNgiGuxFaa	anke io sn triste|`|w2RTikLCaa	affittati un bel DVD da ridere, cosi' ti distrai un po'......|`|48qEbMG0aa	SU COL MORALE|`|0JQaWrFIaa	sport consiglio la corsa, musica tutto volume..|`|Pm3me87faa	CIOCCOLATAAAAAA poi tira a campare fino a domani. domani è un altro giorno.<br>  io solitamente faccio un giretto in macchina per le strade della murgia e contemplo la natura. non ti tira su ma ti aiuta a metabolizzare i cattivi pensieri.<br>  un bacio|`|RzhUQil1aa	prima cosa: Nutella!

Se ricevi questa lettera, vuol dire che è arrivata,se non la ricevi, fammelo sapere, così te la rimando. Scrivo lentemente perchè so che tu non sai leggere in fretta. Qualche tempo fa tuo padre ha letto sul giornale che la maggior parte degli incidenti capitano entro un raggio di un chilometro dal luogo di abitazione così abbiamo deciso di traslocare un pò più lontano. La nuova casa è meravigliosa ,c'è anche una lavatrice,ma non sono sicura che funzioni. Proprio ieri ci ho messo dentro il bucato, ho tirato l'acqua e poi il bucato è sparito completamente. Il tempo qui non è troppo brutto. La settimana scorsa ha piovuto due volte: la prima volta per tre giorni la seconda per quattro. Ti voglio anche informare che tuo padre ha un nuovo lavoro: adesso ha 500 persone sotto di se, infatti taglia l'erba nel cimitero. A proposito della giacca che mi avevi chiesto, tuo zio Piero mi ha detto che spedirtela coi bottoni sarebbe stato molto caro (per via del peso dei bottoni). Allora li ho staccati. Se pensi di riattaccarli, te li ho messi tutti nella tasca interna.Tuo fratello Gianni ha fatto una grossa sciocchezza con la macchina: è sceso e ha chiuso di scatto la portiera lasciando dentro le chiavi. Allora è dovuto rientrare a casa a prendere il secondo mazzo, e così anche noi siamo potuti scendere dalla macchina. Se vedi Margherita salutala da parte mia. Se non la vedi non dirle niente. Adesso ti saluto perchè devo correre all'ospedale, tua sorella sta per partorire, ma non so ancora se avrà un bambino o una bambina perciò non so dirti se sarai zio o zia.<br>  <br>  Un forte abbraccio dalla tua mamma che ti vuole tanto bene.<br>  <br>  PS.

gHBSPweMaa	Si estas hablando de aquellos que se aplican directamente en la nariz, la mayoría son "vasoconstrictores", uno clásico es una sustancia llamada Nafazolina. Este tipo de medicamentos constri?en o cierran los vasos sanguíneos, disminuyendo con esto el "edema" o inflamación de la mucosa nasal, disminuyendo así las secreciones (MOCOS) y la obstrucción.

AA12268495	Oh, yes you can definitely get them from stress! When my Granny died, my whole trunk & thighs broke out in nasty, itchy red hives :( It is super stressful to experience them, especially when there is not a specific reason (like allergies, etc.)<br>  <br>  Try taking Benadryl when you have them ~ check w/your pharmacist to make sure it doesn't interfere w/the medications you are currently on. Benadryl may make you sleepy, but it will help to clear them up & stop the itching. You can also take an oatmeal bath (I think Aveeno makes oatmeal soaks to add to your bath water.) It sounds gross ~ but feels wonderful  on all of those itchy red spots. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|hQQAwdRZaa	try going to  { genniesalve.com } its a new product,and it really helps alot.

Whatever you do, stay away from the computer. It has been proven that watching the TV or computer before bed wakes up your head and makes it nearly impossible to fall asleep quickly which just urges people to stay on the computer for longer. i would read or just put on some music and maybe have a soothing bath or something to relax then try to fall asleep again. I guarantee it will help you. :)|`|UjxYQNRFaa	A bit more physical work and exercise each day will soon see you in dreamland having happy dreams.

En el caso del termino neoplasia se refiere a lo que es una alteracion de las celulas en donde estas crecen de manera incontrolada. Las neoplasias benignas no son cancerosas. Generalmente pueden removerse o extirparse y, en la mayoría de los casos, no reaparecen. Lo importante es que las células de tejidos benignos no se extienden a otras partes del cuerpo. Las células de tumores benignos permanecen juntas y a menudo son rodeadas por una membrana de contención o cápsula. Los tumores benignos no constituyen generalmente una amenaza para la vida.<br>  Y<br>  Los tumores malignos son cancerosos. Las células cáncerosas pueden invadir y da?ar tejidos y órganos cercanos al tumor. Las células cancerosas pueden separarse del tumor maligno y entrar al sistema linfático o al flujo sanguíneo, que es la manera en que el cáncer alcanza otras partes del cuerpo. El aspecto característico del cáncer es la capacidad de la célula de crecer rápidamente, de manera descontrolada e independiente del tejido donde comenzó. La propagación del cáncer a otros sitios u órganos en el cuerpo mediante el flujo sanguíneo o el sistema linfático se llama metástasis.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Benigno= Bueno<br>  Maligno= Malo<br>  <br>  Son tumores que se identifican de esa manera cuando son buenos o malos.

Nell'italiano moderno, questa valenza negativa si riscontra pienamente nella parola merda, ed è mitigata nei suoi molti sinonimi. Il termine merda è considerato generalmente una parolaccia, e il suo uso al di fuori del linguaggio colloquiale è oggi deprecato come offensivo, oppure come espressione volgare per manifestare le proprie idee riguardo le diverse situazioni che possono essere di disagio o negative.<br>  <br>  L'uso come qualificativo e interiezione<br>  <br>  A differenza che in altre lingue europee (inglese ****, francese merde, tedesco Schei?e, spagnolo mierda), l'uso della parola merda come esclamazione per esprimere irritazione non è molto diffuso in italiano, essendo generalmente sostituita da cazzo in questa funzione: ?Merda, non trovo più le chiavi!?. Un caso particolare è la locuzione di merda (o merda di), usata come qualificativo in senso di pessimo: ?una situazione di merda?, una situazione spiacevolissima; ?un uomo/pezzo di merda?, un uomo esecrabile, un farabutto; ricorre frequentemente nelle esclamazioni del linguaggio triviale: ?Che merda di film!?. L'espressione ?essere/stare/trovarsi nella merda? significa essere nei guai. Tra le frasi polirematiche, possiamo citare ?avere la merda fino al collo? e ?essere una merda?. si può usare anche l'espressione ?Che merda!!? per indicare una situazione sfortunata|`|l0gMTnjSaa	ragazza carina di circa 17 anni...

UV9GuH1Haa	Pues Claro.<br>  Los virus no hacen distinción de sexos.<br>  En algunos hombres es asintomático, (Que no tienen síntomas, pero lo pueden contagiar), pero en otros se manifiesta como verrugas, de hecho las verrugas son tejidos infectados por virus que atacan a la piel, pueden ser del papiloma u otros.<br>  En los casos mas graves, si un individuo tiene las defensas bajas puede derivar en cancer de piel o sarcoma.<br>  Los hombres también se pueden vacunar, pero como las vacunas son caras y los casos de cancer poco frecuentes, no es rentable.<br>  <br>  Que Dios te pille vacunado.|`|2Q68VtM9aa	El VPH o virus del papiloma humano es el agente causal del cáncer de cérvix. Es relativamente frecuente, se transmite por contacto y fluidos y no tiene por qué mostrar signos físicos pero en ocasiones da lugar a verrugas genitales. Hay más de 100 tipos y se han clasificado en 2 grupos:<br>  <br>  Los hombres generalmente no presentan da?os visibles pero son portadores del VPH aunque no presenten lesiones. En ocasiones el VPH puede dar lugar en el hombre a unas lesiones en los genitales denominadas “condilomas” que tienen aspecto de verrugas. <br>  La infección por VPH puede aparecer tanto en las áreas genitales masculinas como las femeninas, estén o no cubiertas o protegidas con un condón de látex. Aunque se desconoce el efecto de los condones en la prevención de la infección por VPH, se ha asociado el uso del condón a una tasa más baja de cáncer cervical, el cual es una enfermedad relacionada con el VPH. <br>  De bajo riesgo oncogénico. Pueden dar lugar a verrugas genitales o cambios en las células del cérvix, pero no suelen degenerar en lesiones graves. <br>  De alto riesgo oncogénico. Son tipos que suelen encontrarse en lesiones graves en el cuello uterino y que suelen degenerar en cáncer. Desarrollan mecanismos que da?an la actividad celular normal.|`|RkRerKtpaa	El virus del papiloma humano (VPH) es un virus común.

Noi persone "normali" siamo in grado di leggere l'abominio che tu hai scritto, perché l'emisfero destro del cervello, deputato alla logica, ci permette in qualche modo di rimettere tutto in ordine tuttavia, siamo noi più limitati perché, per errori meno palesi, non ci rendiamo nemmeno conto che questi errori esistano, mentre il cervello di mister RainMan si rende conto di ogni singolo dettaglio, grazie al suo emisfero sinistro.... Non mi sento proprio di dire che il nostro cervello sia meglio del loro, noi comprendiamo delle cose, loro ne colgono altre... Alle volte vorrei non essermi fumata nemmeno quello che si fumano a Cambridge, ma quello che si fumano i cosiddetti "sub-normali", che magari non sono in grado di comprendere quel che tu hai scritto, ma riescono ad esprimersi attraverso vere e proprie opere d'arte, che riescono a fare cose che per noi sarebbero davvero impensabili... Il cervello umano è una gran cosa, pure quando noi pensiamo che non funzioni...

403e839ec0225d0f64fa75237d91f2ddaa	Sorry, but you probably won't be able to use any hormonal birth control.  I am also 30 and have high blood pressure (I do have 2 kids, though).  I have had high bp since I was 15 (so does the rest of my family... it's genetic in my case).  I was on the patch for a few years after my youngest was born in addition to blood pressure medicine, but after a while, the bp meds were not working & my dr. told me I would not be able to use the patch (or any hormonal birth control) any more.  Since I've come off the patch, the bp is better (but I still have to take bp meds to keep it in check).<br>  <br>  I think you can still use an IUD with high bp.  You have to have your dr. put that in, though, and it is a pretty long term birth control method, from what I understand.<br>  <br>  We opted for "permanent" birth control... but we're done having kids (my hubby had this done; the operation is easier for men than for women).<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you can't be on the pill anymore... I know exactly how you feel.  I think I was more upset that I would be going back to cramps and heavier bleeding with my period than the whole birth control aspect of the patch!

C3eLEKnLaa	Credo che l'Anima non trasmigri proprio per niente.  Credo che lo Spirito sopravviva.   Credo che lo Spirito non sia l'Anima .  Credo che ci si reincarni, ma è complesso spiegarti come , e su alcuni passaggi non ho le idee chiare neppure io. Credo che la ns Religione *abbia volutamente confuso le cose* e abbia fatto in modo da non far trapelare queste e altre semplici verità .  Che ci si reincarni o no , questa vita resta l'unica vita che stiamo vivendo adesso, anche se ci reincarnassimo *non ci ricorderemo più niente  di ora nè di chi siamo stati  ecc. *  onde per cui  vale la pena di essere felici il più a lungo possibile , di amarci e di amare il ns prossimo ( ogni religione ha precetti e comandamenti più o meno validi al proposito ) .  Credo che la vita vada vissuta degnamente, con onore, con passione, con volontà , con amore, con impegno , con entusiasmo e con intelligenza.

krJNnYLHaa	I used to work at a YMCA, and I know that the personal trainers are dedicated and well informed.  They are extremely helpful and focused, and are also very friendly.  <br>  <br>  However, I'm not sure that losing that much weight so quickly is healthy--you should lose about 2 pounds a week at most to keep your body working well.|`|q2JmOFGLaa	well there is no way in hell that you can loose 75 pounds in a month and if you start thinking that way you'll get in  a vicious cycle.  It is only healthy to loose up to 5 pounds a week, otherwise it will all come back.  At the very most you should/could lose 15-20 pounds in  a month but it is more likely you'll get around 10 if you work hard and stick to a diet and fitness plan.  Yes personal trainers work if you do what they say and eat healthy.  You could reach your goal weight in around 7 months, or if you hit your growth spurt even sooner.  Don't get too caught up in pounds, though.  Just try to be healthy.|`|AA11962116	I think that is a wonderful idea.  As far as does it "work"?  Exercise and eating healthy foods always works except in very rare cases for people with certain diseases.  <br>  <br>  Remember it's not the "trainer" that "works" but your commitment to follow through and do what the trainer teaches you to do.  The best trainer in the world won't work if you don't follow the program he gives you.<br>  <br>  It's the cardio that will burn calories and help your body use the food you eat AND some strength training will help you build muscle, get stronger, and be "fit' and toned.<br>  <br>  Just remember to focus on getting your daily 3-4 veggies and 2-4 fruit so that you are getting enough nutritious foods and some of the urges for junk food will subside if you focus on the GOOD stuff to eat.|`|046Cj817aa	You are young so it shouldn't be a problem to lose most of the weight that you want to, but I don't think that you should aim for a number so high, I think that 50 pounds is a bit more reasonable. It is good that you are taking care of this now, and a personal trainer is a great support system that will only help you in your endeavor. However I would also recommend going to see a nutritionist because they can help you get back into the habit of eating healthy. <br>  <br>  I am so sorry to hear about your father and I wish you all the luck in the world.
DFJ9m4WKaa	Muscle weighs more than fat. You don't need to gain weight, you need to work out. Its just as simple as that. <br>  <br>  You can eat a lot of fatty foods like fish and meats, which is not all that bad if you are also working out. But if all you do is gain weight, then you'll just get fat around your stomach and thighs that will be very hard to get rid of and you may suffer health consequences later down the road.<br>  <br>  And hey if you really want to gain weight, by the time you're 21, just start drinking beer!... jk that'd be even more unhealthy.|`|OoaZGumxaa	I also have a huge problem gaining weight. My sugguestion would be to start working out more and increase your calories. My doctor told me to drink the Weight Gain drinks you can get at like wal-mart or walgreens. (Like slim fast, only the opposite) He also said to do workouts such as crunches, push ups, because that builds muscle. I have gained about 7 pounds so far, but you have to be persistant and do it every day. With all those extra calories, if you don't work out, they will go to fat, even with a high metabolism. Good luck!|`|2tCmK6Lyaa	carbs give you energy and make you bigger, but not fatter, unless you don't exercise at all. with your metabolism, you should eat pastas and breads to gain weight. drinking milk for calcium is a great way to build muscle. i would also highly recommened protein bars. they build mucle really fast, like within a month or so of eating them almost every day. hpoe this helps!|`|5Y8VZuGJaa	pump iron bro!!! no do pull ups, drink a lot of milk,|`|mppB9ebgaa	normal wieght dude. Start working out, and take the protien drinks.|`|t3OxbttCaa	well to gain weight, eat alot of carbs !!! and to gain muscle??? well u kinda have to workout for that . i dont know if u can GAIN muscle by eating|`|3CWfbsHNaa	I have the same "problem" as yours, and its not that you eat too little.  People like you, my father, and me take in a lot of food, but our digestive system doesn't process as much nutrients as other individuals - most of the nutrients go directly to waste.  That is why that I don't gain much weight even though I eat meat and fish  every dinner, every day.<br>  <br>  What you can do is to start exercising.  Body fitness sheds off muscle fibers, and your body needs to regenerate that muscle fiber.  Now I haven't been doing much rigorous exercise the past few months, so I can't confirm whether exercising can significantly "trick" your body into gaining more weight: yea, muscles do weigh more than fat :)<br>  <br>  Drinking protein shakes/yogurts can also help gain weight.  My father drank Ensure milk (packed full of vitamins, calories, and proteins) and gained 4 pounds in 3 weeks.  It's relatively low in fat, in fact.<br>  <br>  Other than that, 16 years of age, 120 lbs, and 5 feet 6 inches; thats still pretty healthy.  Although I have to admit a little skinny: I just turned 17, weigh 133lbs, and am 5 feet 11 inches.|`|BiQ5h8Ecaa	Get a membership at a local gym... check out bodybuilding.com and this post in particular for a great weight lifting plan <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=998224." rel="nofollow">http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread...</a>  Lifting weights will help you build muscle and tone.

AA11761032	Nope, gonorrhea is only trasmitted through sexual activity with an infected partner or from a mother to her child during labor. <br>  And for a better understanding other sexual activity includes, vaginal, oral and anal.|`|DfYnA7Ikaa	You can get oral gonorrhea from performing oral sex, usually when a man ejaculates in your mouth or puts any sort of body fluids in there.  It usually presents as a sore/strep type throat.  Likewise a man can catch it from giving oral sex to a women although thats a little harder.

La gran mayoria de los hombres lo tenemos "mirando de lado". El pene que en ereccion este totalmente recto es muy poco frecuente. Muchos lo tienen doblado hacia arriba, algunos pocos hacia abajo, y es muy frecuente ver que tiene una desviacion hacia algun lado.<br>  Malo es si lo tenias antes mas o menos derecho (poco doblado), y despues de una relacion muy vigoroza y fuerte dolor lo veas muy torcido o doblado hacia un lado, y con un "bulto" del lado opuesto. Eso se llama (no lo creeras) "fractura de pene". Si...aunque no tiene hueso, el pene se puede "fracturar". Consiste en que las partes "hidraulicas", que se hinchan y llenan de sangre, sufren una ruptura, por traumatismo, y se vierte sangre por fuera de los canales normales. Se forma un hematoma y se desvia el pene por efecto mecanico.<br>  Si este no ha sido tu caso, no debes preocuparte. Pero si tus dudas persisten acude al Medico Urologo, es a quien le corresponde este asunto.<br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte|`|DKezTQUtaa	es normal no pasa nada si lo tienes doblado mucha jente lo tiene asi|`|SNUbNutJaa	Mira vas a necesitar, una tabla, un martillo, un taladro, un cincel,  <br>  y talvez unos clavos dependiendo, jaa no te creas, eso de que este inclinado es normal, yo la tengo hacia la izquierda y se que no es de preocuparse, el problema es si te resulta incomodo a la hora de tener sexo, o también si te la quieres enderezar para ser un "actor" porno. Lo mejor es que vayas con el urólogo, y que te diga que tan grave esta tu asunto, lo mas seguro es que te diga lo mismo, ya tu nomas le preguntas el tama?o del cincel,  jaja no te creas es broma.

4iAMrHd1aa	First thing is to get your cardio work in.  Run.  A lot.   Do it every day for several weeks.  Then add it a half-hour a day of squats, lunges, pushups, etc.  Spend at least 30 minutes total every day exercising! <br>  <br>  After you get good at all that, add in a little weight training if you want additional size.  By then, you'll be comfortable enough exercising to make the proper decision.<br>  <br>  Muscle confusion is important too.  After the first few weeks of running, mix up your routine so that you don't do the same thing every day.  |`|NVGJHsvnaa	well my brother is 19 and 200 <br>  <br>  i suggest working out like me and being very active will help <br>  <br>  im 14 in 9th grade and in good shape but i am very very active <br>  <br>  i only play softball and i get sick some times but that does not bother me <br>  <br>  also i dont have many friends that live near me so i believe that my strong imagination helps alot <br>  <br>  and i cant realy stand being inside not even when its raining|`|CNns60Kdaa	Cut down on eatting and focus on yogurt and arobic activity|`|FRwa1nF9aa	I think you are tall.

The trainers are very supportive and it is quite fun - plus affordable.  <br>  <br>  Quite honestly, you get out of it what you put into it.  There are women there that go just for the fact that they CAN get a little exercise in, and then I know this one woman who's lost 55 lbs in 8 months by going regularly and correcting her eating habits - she looks amazing now!<br>  <br>  If you are looking for endorsement - you have mine!

Faire l'amour donne un regain d'énergie que les femmes tirent de leurs ovaires et les hommes de leur sperme. L'homme doit donc retarder le plus possible le moment de l'éjaculation ou mieux encore, il doit parvenir à jouir sans éjaculation (et oui, il parait que c'est tout à fait possible !). Selon les tao?stes, lorsque la semence quitte le corps de l'homme, ce dernier perd une précieuse source d'énergie.<br>  En retardant le moment de sa jouissance, l'homme permet aussi à sa partenaire d'espérer plusieurs co?ts dans un seul rapport. La femme peut l'aider à se retenir en lui pin?ant le point ? p'ing-yi ? situé à 3 cm sous le mamelon droit. L'homme peut en plus contracter son abdomen, comptez jusqu'à 100 (histoire de penser à autre chose) ou encore s'imposer une respiration plus ample et régulière. Toutes ces astuces calmeront son excitation et feront durer le plaisir !

Tuttavia il fumo determina danni in misura molto maggiore rispetto all'alcol. Non so dove tu abbia preso quei dati, ma dalle mie conoscenze mediche sono sbagliati. Attualmente si stima che il fumo sia responsabile DA SOLO del 30 -35% dei tumori umani, per non parlare degli altri danni (cardiovascolari, polmonari, etc). L'alcol è un "vizio" molto più accettato a livello sociale: un'assunzione modica risulta positiva (riduce la mortalità) mentre l'abuso può avere effetti deleteri, che si esprimono nel proprio massimo solo nell'alcolista, mentre, nell'individuo normale sono ridotti dalla capacità dell'organismo di metabolizzare l'alcol. Su quest'ultima popolazione grava però parte della mortalità dovuta ad incidenti stradali.|`|5c6d0e4bf5a086ad30f0607c19d67150aa	perkè spesso l' alcool è sottovalutato anke se può essere pegggio anke della droga e spesso nn sl tra gli adulti ma anke tra i giovani|`|b72919823af694e439c900eb511b37a9aa	Guarda che la lotta contro l'alcool la si fa da tempo.

5367c3304cf1e90e322d77537b1cb890aa	Hon 13 is the typical age for stating your cycle. I was in 6th grade when I started mine.I don't think it will be a problem talking to your hero about it. But you should also be able to talk to your mother about it. Me and my daughter talk about ALMOST everything. So try to break the barrier with mom too. She might feel appreciated knowing that you would like her advice. Take care and god bless|`|38a52321b2736bfedffcf55448d70c67aa	Just ask her.

3ax1a4scaa	You need to find a way to release this stress. The best way to do this is to find somebody to talk to. When you leave all these thoughts in your head you are only suffocating your mind. It's your minds way of telling you to get it out, so you can deal with other issues. I'm not sure whats causing the stress, but you need to find a way to avoid it. If it's work related, try to take a break, or even a vacation. Your mental health is more important than getting money. <br>  <br>  Go see a psychologist or therapist because it will help you alleviate some stress just from talking to them, and if you suffer from anxiety disorder they will prescribe you a medication that will make your life a lot easier. My roommate has anxiety disorder and it's sad to see what he goes through when he's off his medication. But when he's on it he's perfectly fine.|`|hsYWTY5vaa	Your doctor can prescribe medications for stress.  I take Inderal for anxiety attacks.  Inderal is not your typical panic attack drug, such as Xanax.  Inderal is for hypertension, but it stops the heart from racing, and without a racing heart, none of the other physical steps that are required for an anxiety attack to occur can occur.  If you do ask for Inderal, ask for the regular version, not the long-acting, so it will get into your system faster.<br>  <br>  Want something OTC?  <br>  <br>  1) Rescue Remedy, sold at all Whole Foods and other health food stores. Use every fifteen minutes until you get some relief. It's OTC, no Rx needed;<br>  <br>  2)  Passion Flower, an herbal remedy.  Called "Nature's Xanax."  I used the brand shown at <a href="http://store.sawpalmettoproducts.com/pafl360mgcab.html," rel="nofollow">http://store.sawpalmettoproducts.com/paf...</a> and<br>  <br>  3) meditation. See <a href="http://www.how-to-meditate.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.how-to-meditate.org/</a> to get started.<br>  <br>  Do see your doctor, though.  There are tons of medications for this, and until you get ahead of the anxiety, you will want something.<br>  <br>  Godspeed to feeling better.|`|JrzXTKziaa	After a rather stressful day their is nothing better than booting up a game like Battlefield 2 and loading a heavy metal play-list then proceeding to fragging the living daylights out of someone half way around the world and having a good laugh when it comes back towards me. That usually calms me down and relaxes me to the point I forget about what ever started to bug me.

When I say play its not about savoring it like a slice of meat....start gently, from the bottom of the breasts...work your way up slowly until you reach the summit...the nipple...dont forget the aeroles, the dark patch around the nips....very sensitive part of a woman's breast... dont keep chewing the nipples...kiss-lick-suck should be sequence..or whichever sequence works for both of you..but the point is take the time and experiment...the indicator of the good mood is an erect nipple...and the inviting p-u-ss-y...more about p-u-ss-y and using the p-u-ss-y to excite your girl later..c ya dude...|`|AA11579268	For me I wear a sexy out fit and 1 or 2 times a day is ok|`|2654a2e3d00fed77317e4d21cc816164aa	I would get him in the mood by turning the lights down,giving him a hot oil massage and rub my b.oobs all over him. like to have sex as many times as possible!|`|4023bb1d0dc895f7d43d0853020cbc39aa	Well, I just started dating this guy, so we haven't had sex yet.

I've finally found my current guy's erogenous zone (on his stomach - Weirder, right?), but it's all in the kiss.  That's how ya' get thangs started ;)|`|AA12354487	I start to touch him, kiss him.  I take my blouse off and I'll sit on him and rub up against him!

I have many sexy costumes school girl outfit, french maid, and tons of lingerie. All I have to do is get dressed up and he's in the mood. I also once a month do erotic massage. You can find those books anywhere... i got mine from a library and jsut never returned it cause i moved.... other way around for him to get me in the mood involves kissing on the neck and ears. A good back massage.

ufCpkTacaa	It is probably an allergy... hayfever?<br>  because if the thing you are allergic to is there at night you will breath through your mouth and it will get dry (because your not drinking when your asleep lol) so that will make it sore and some the thing you are allergic to may go down your throat, so you will cough, making it more irritated.|`|6ae2f072d1aa4c5ad3b45f388352d5fbaa	Well, technically, you do feel sick (i.e. losing my voice, my throat is kinda irritated, and I have cough).  These are all symptoms.  You don't have symptoms of nausea, feeling sick.  But you are displaying symptoms of being sick.  You need to go to a doctor to determine the nature of your illness because you may be contagious.  Hope you feel better and I'm sure it's nothing serious.|`|reAE5j7Eaa	It could be allergies.

Most girls I think trim the front though.|`|WqpRy643aa	Its up to you.|`|DfYnA7Ikaa	It is totally up to you.    I would not recommend using a razor on the actually lips of the vaginia or inside really close because you could cut yourself.  If you are intrested in taking that hair off you should wax.    You can just let it grow and not wax at all, up to you.  Most men though will want to have it at least trimmed down.|`|N3RysJo8aa	First your not supposed to shave any where down there, only do it if you want to.

For those with heart burn (gastroesophageal reflux), sleeping with the right side down actually worsens nighttime reflux and for those with obstructive sleep apnea, sleeping flat on your back tends to worsen this condition. Sleeping on your back also increases snoring. Sleeping on ones stomach may obstruct breathing.

AA10944764	Yeah, hi I'm the head trainer at Houston Dynamo MLS. I would keep training this summer maybe find a local college to train at. The main thing is to eat lots of protein (meats, cheese, vegies). Stay in the gym lots of good ab workouts you can do. Also you would probably benefit from some kind of agility quickness program. Also work on increasing your reaction time, just getting your eyes on the ball and trusting you can make the stop. Good luck in your soccer endeavors and hope to see you on the big stage :) <br>  P.S. Here's a list of my favorite ab workouts:<br>     1. Bicycle Exercise<br>     2. Captain's Chair<br>     3. Exercise Ball Crunch<br>     4. Vertical Leg Crunch<br>     5. Torso Track<br>     6. Long Arm Crunch<br>     7. Reverse Crunch<br>     8. Full Vertical Crunch<br>     9. Ab Rocker<br>    10. Plank on Elbows and Toes|`|8c46b279a7fb96614d3adf83e86398adaa	i play soccer too we just do exercises on stratgizing in the actual game but just start running crunches or balll touches are really good for your abs and ball control|`|mZqb6YUbaa	keep working out

The precise cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood. There is some evidence suggesting it is caused by a combination of auto-immune, genetic, and environmental factors. The population incidence worldwide is considered to be between 1% and 2%.[1]<br>  <br>  According to Diseases Database: "A disorder consisting of areas of macular depigmentation, commonly on extensor aspects of extremities, on the face or neck, and in skin folds. Age of onset is often in young adulthood and the condition tends to progress gradually with lesions enlarging and extending until a quiescent state is reached."|`|DfYnA7Ikaa	It could be way too many different things that cannot be addressed with this one question.  Bottom line tell her to see a doctor ASAP.|`|Gx2KJIbSaa	Eczema
DfYnA7Ikaa	You can skip a period while on the pill.  However,  if you have been on the same pill for years and this has never happened to you, it is highly unlikely that your missed period is due to the pill.   It could be due to pregnancy because you were taking antibiotics.  Only certain antibiotics mess with the lining of the stomach, and make it a possibility that your pill might not absorb into the body causing you to get pregnant.     Its not all antibidocs that do this just some and usually it says really big on the label that it may have interactions with birth control.  You can call the pharmacist where you got the antibiodics to be sure.     If you throw up that too can mean the pill won't absorb.  It could also be that the sickenss and antibiodcis just threw yoru cycle off.  That has happened to me many times.  I know its hard but give it a week or so, and if you still have not gotten your period and are testing negative call the doctor.   Good luck.

zovcvRGIaa	Studies show uncircumcised: <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com</a> and there's another study too.<br>  <br>  Most women I've spoken to have either said no difference or uncircumcised. the ones who say circumcised are usually from the USA and speaking about looks rather than function. Brutally Honest's answer is a good example, she just has this idea that's been ingrained into her socially that a normal penis is "unclean". (and no, a normal penis hasn't been linked to cervical problems in women. I believe the study in question originally thought circumcision helped because they found lower rates of cervical cancer in some orthodox Jewish communities. then they realised it was just lack of promiscuity that caused it.) <br>  <br>  I've only been with uncircumcised and it's perfect. I don't know why anybody would want the foreskin missing. It's a normal part of the penis and fun to play with. Giving oral to an uncut guy isn't dirty at all and there's heaps to do with the foreskin that gives them lots of pleasure.|`|R0EB39FGaa	it doesn't matter to me. As long as a guy is clean it doesn't matter. LOL, not every women has the prettiest vagina you know? I don't get why some girls make it a huge deal. It is very annoying.anyways so yeah!|`|korVixJxaa	I live in the U.S. and I've had two uncircumcised partners in the past.  My boyfriend of two years is circumcised (cut), but I prefer uncircumcised (uncut)<br>  <br>  I enjoyed foreplay even more with uncut because the foreskin made the motions easier.  <br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, I don't really notice a difference between cut or uncut. <br>  <br>  Every woman is different though.  You could have one partner that loves it and the next partner might be grossed out.  It is different for some regions though.  Both of the guys that I dated that were uncut were foreigners, so it was normal to them.  And all of the guys I've dated that were cut were Americans, so it was also normal to them.  Many American girls might be surprised to find an uncut penis and might not be sure what to do with it. <br>  <br>  With the first uncut boyfriend, I was very confused and was afraid I would hurt him.  I had no idea how to touch him or the foreskin.  When I began dating the second uncut guy, he talked to me a lot about it and showed me what I could do that HE liked best.  If you live in an area where most men are cut, you could talk to your future partners about being uncut so they aren't surprised or confused.  <br>  <br>  Be proud of who you are and what you have!  Any girl who is disgusted is probably just unsure.  You are totally normal, so don't let any girl make you feel bad about yourself.  There are millions of girls out there (like me) who prefer uncut men.<br>  <br>  In response to the un-clean remark above:<br>  The two guys I dated that were uncut had VERY good hygiene. If they had not, I wouldn't have dated them.  They had better hygiene than the cut guys I had dated.  A girl does notice those things, so be sure to keep yourself very clean down there!  I'm sure you know all about that.|`|ZTggXz5Xaa	Over here where I live in New Zealand, circumcised penises are of a rare occurance.<br>  I have never seen one.<br>  My boyfriend is uncircumcised and he is amazing in the bedroom. Although I have nothing to compare him to.<br>  And no, his penis does not gross me out. I love it. Haha.|`|DfYnA7Ikaa	I've been with both and  honest makes no difference to me at all.  You can not tell during sex one way or the other.  Some women prefer the way a circumcised penis looks if they are performing oral.    Personally I could care less.|`|y0ZO8rbzaa	well it doesnt matter during sex because you cant really tell and besides that we can only feel two inches of your penis. and as for oral. i prefer my boyfriends who is circumsised
BmMkHeObaa	Mood swings are a common side effect of birth control pills so they're most likely the reason.|`|C4JYCZFkaa	it could but everyone on here and in real life (including myself) have gained weight from it.  i gained like 80 pounds on it.  it was horrible.|`|DfYnA7Ikaa	Well the low dose ones are supposed to not cause as bad of mood swings as the full strength ones, but yes it could most certainly be causing mood swings it alters your hormones.  Talk to your doctor.  There are tons of different bc pills out there and there is probably one that won't cause this for you.  I had the same problem with orthcept.  But now I am on Seasonale and don't have it anymore.

vkhc8Co1aa	I say this so often - the flu vaccine is not a live vaccine therefore you cannot get flu from the flu jab. <br>  <br>  However the vaccine only protects you from only one strain of the virus so it is feasible that you could have another strain. But looking at your symptoms it doesn't sound severe enough to be flu, just another stinking cold which is everywhere right now.<br>  <br>  Get Well Soon xxxx|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	Sounds like it.
hcqNXUH5aa	Sometimes when I take Pepto Bismal my tongue turns a dark color.  It depends upon what I previously ate or drank, which then reacts to the Pepto Bismal.  I've heard that the combo of alcohol and PB can cause this.   |`|RvuKTT0Jaa	She definitely had taken a Pepto-Bismol chewable tablet before she went to bed which resulted in her waking up with a black tongue in the morning on those 2 occasions.<br>  <br>  Pepto-Bismol has been known to cause one’s tongue and stool to turn black. This form of “black tongue”, however, is a result of the separation of bismuth from salicylate, forming bismuth trisulfide (Bi2S3) in combination with the sulfur found in saliva.<br>  <br>  Brushing the tongue with a toothbrush and water helps remove the blackness.|`|4lX5Mdaoaa	Has she had a piercing in her mouth? Something simple like a stud? When you have this done sometimes it can get infected and make your tongue turn black. It could be an infection even without a piercing. she could of just cut her tongue with a sharp pencil/broken sweet/crusty bread or anything sharp for that matter. ask her if she has had anything done, or has Had a cut recently.<br>  <br>  does she know about it? If not tell her, THEN ask her, so it doesn't seem out of the blue. if she also has got a lisp it may be an infection. Call her now and ask her, dont leave it to late or anything could happen<br>  <br>  Shambie x p.s: hope this helps. :]|`|7W34uvyyaa	See a doctor immediately, it can be tissue death when a limb turns black.|`|DC4Civrvaa	Yeah, it's an antacid that's doing it.

Are people really that dumb or do they just not read the questions?|`|1e10910b250864ea0ce78f8ff1dcd0e6aa	Yes Medicine could be a cause, if you read on Pepto Bismol it says the tongue might turn dark temporarily.<br>  <br>  But you need to ask her, and see… maybe she’s facing a totally different issue.|`|Hbvquautaa	is she a smoker? have her go to the doc right away you don't want this to progress!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hairy_tongue" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hairy...</a><br>  <br>  |`|uiVyCHHGaa	'black hairy tongue' disease?<br>  on wiki it said that its caused by tobacco often.<br>  contact a doctor.|`|W38fxDTwaa	antibiotics, smoking, I cant remeber the name of the fungus.|`|rZNuErcwaa	Pepto bismol can turn your tongue black. |`|iHvOJQ4zaa	licorice.|`|herWWlg6aa	did she lick your pooper???|`|aGin9bXyaa	My friend's tongue turns black after she takes certain pills.

848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	People who aren't able to stop smoking pot tend to have a seratonin imbalance and without knowing it have self medicated by smoking pot. Because the pot was, albeit in a destructive way, "correcting' this imbalance (at least it felt this way), it has to be replaced with the real treatment for seratonin imbalance in order to be able to stop being craved. So in other words you have to replace it with the medicine you should have had before you started to smoke pot. See your general doctor and tell them that you need a seratonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI aka antidepressant) for quitting smoking. This SSRI will also help with other impulsive/addictive behaviors that you may or may not have like smoking, gambling, shopping etc.<br>  Good for you for asking. This shows a real drive to stop and a desire to get your life back on track. You've taken a huge step by inquiring and that's half the battle. Now all you have to do is to ask your doctor to replace the pot with the true balance your body is really craving. The results take a few weeks, but you will feel like a billion bucks when you've kicked the pot habit.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|Vanf51Pzaa	You can't stop smoking pot because you are addicted.  There will be places where you can get help in ending the addiction.  <br>  <br>  Get help and get out.  <br>  <br>  You will feel so much happier once you have shaken this, pot is a very depressive drug.|`|mBlhKNPVaa	it's a habit...duh. Go seek help before it fries your brain.|`|AA11447210	It's become a habitual behavior, you like the way it makes you feel, thus are addicted to the side effects. Pot itself isn't addictive, but there are some people that can become addicted to anything (even certain behaviors).<br>  <br>  If you cannot stop on your own (simply cease purchasing it) then get professional help to assist you. The fact that it is illegal (in the US) and could cause you more problems in that respect, than the high is worth, should be some measure of incentive to find a way to end (or seriously curtail) your usage.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Why not?<br>  <br>  Everyone KNOWS smoking pot isn't addictive . . . .<br>  <br>  Sorry, bud, you ARE addicted.  You need to see a doctor who can help you get off this stuff with minimal pain.|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	About 15% of the population finds marijuana addictive. If you can't stop on your own, I suggest you seek drug counseling, they can help you beat the addiction.|`|797fa0c2e4b7024ce45d98fa45651a50aa	Because it's become your life source, it's gotcha. I used to smoke all the time for a few years and finally when I wanted to stop I couldn't. Had to ask God for help on that because I just couldn't, and He did help me, and He did help me see how it really is. There's no little bit with smoking it, it's either all or nothing, it won't settle for half your life it wants ALL of it!|`|NxAsYUiLaa	If you smoke it at a particular time each day, then you might be mentally addicted to it - try doing something similar at that time like chew gum or have a cup of coffee.<br>  (but not alcohol or cigarettes) if that doesn't work, try and get help.<br>  good luck!|`|4uPC9iEmaa	It's probably habit, plus, when you stop it takes like 2 weeks to get over all that groggy, moody feelings that come through. <br>  If you can get through that you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Take Care!|`|26w8g54iaa	Your in a rut aka 420 R us lol.

From there, cut 500 calories per day from your diet. This will lose you 1 pound per week. Do not eat less than 500 calories below your daily normal, as your body will go into starvation mode and begin slowing your metabolism (which will cause you to gain more weight). <br>  <br>  In addition, do 500 calories of exercise per day (with about 2 days per week of rest). This will burn another 1 pound per week. Do not exceed 500 calories per day, as you can injure yourself.|`|oY4qlNqaaa	Losing it fast can be bad for your health.  Start cutting corners on what you eat.  For example, don't put mayonaise on your sandwich, don't eat a roll with your salad, cut out soda, tea, coffee, energy drinks, kool-aid, gatorade, etc., don't use butter.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Quit eating so much.

Loose 7 lbs. a week or 45lbs in 1 1/2 months. You better excersize or you will have some loose saggy skin from loosing too much weight this fast. Eat 20 net carbs a day for 2 weeks, every week after that you must add another 10 net carbs onto your diet or you will develope cholestrol problems, get a calorie/carb counter book, so you will know how many net carbs are in every food with a label like fruits and veggies. Eat protein like Eggs, Cheese, Meats, Green Veggies, ect... crystal light, diet soda, splenda or sweet n low in moderation. At some point you wont need to add one any more carbs because you will be able to normal agian, this speeds up your motabolism, and allows your to be able to take in more carbs without gaining weight. You might not start to gain the weight back for a long time but if you do just cut out some carbs and sugars or substitue them, just dont go crazy and eat junk food only. This is a very hard diet to do because you can not eat most things the first few weeks. No milk,cerial,bread,beans,rice,tortillas, no carbs, only low carbs. This is not a no-carb diet, that diet is bad for you, this is a modified low-carb diet my moms doctor friend told her about shes a registered nurse. She has successfully kept off the wieght for 7 years with no health issues she looks great, I've done it  but it's so hard it does work for sure, I lost 45lbe in 1 1/2 months but then I got pregnant 3 more times, I plan on doing it agian with excersize this time.  Make sure you can afford the food to stick with it protein is expensive. Beef jerky or string cheese great snacks. The money issue is my problem right now or I would be on it. You can eat as much as you want just keep it under 20 carbs, eat omlets steak as much as you want zero carbs. |`|4tOWBXh5aa	It depends, if you want to lose it fast but then gain it back when you start eating normally. If you want to lose it for good it will take longer.<br>  Losing weight fast:<br>  -cut out sodium(salt)because it causes you to bloat(retain water)<br>  -cut out carbs (ex. white bread, pasta) <br>  EAT ALOT OF LEAN PROTEINS (salmon is VERY good for you)<br>  exercise :to get a quick tone do 3 sets of 10 pushups <br>  and do alot of situps (this will cause you muscles to tighten but it doesnt last forever!)<br>  <br>  To keep weight off:<br>  -eat about 1500 calories a day(mostly from protein)<br>  -Exercise alot (make sure you get at least 4 hours of cardio a week...you can break it up)<br>  -dont eat alot of fatty or procesed foods- the more natural the better!<br>  -also eat tons of FIBER(but try to make sure its not from eating white breads!)<br>      ****GOOD LUCK***|`|HwJesaVfaa	losing weight fast is not healthy!<br>  losing weight takes time <br>  <br>  you have to exercise and eat healthy <br>  <br>  one thing that will really help is to drink plenty of water<br>  run because that is the best way to work off calories<br>  and don't eat anything 3 hours before you go to bed<br>  <br>  drinks lots of water before your meals too because that will help you to be less hungry <br>  <br>  but don't try to lose weight fast because it is not a healthy way<br>  you want to be fit and healthy<br>  don't do anything that could cause harm to your body|`|hvKt4ovyaa	My suggestion is that you find a friend that is into running and go for a run, maybe not long on the first one though. this is a personal choice though and it will do some damage to your knees after a while, if you are serious about losing weight buy a cross trainer or bike machine.

lF1LkLCTaa	A common cause of nagging stomach pain especially right after eating is a peptic ulcer or a small hold in the gastrointestinal tract usually duodenal (12 inches of the small intestine beyond the stomach) or a gastric ulcer which is hole in the lining of the stomach. The discomfort can be worse after a meal because the stomach acids produced to break the food down as well as the acids from the food itself can irritate and in some cases inflame the ulcer. I would make an appointment with a gastroenterologist and for further examination. |`|FS9fBgyXaa	That's not good.

Reduce your salt intake and carbohydrate intake and you will drop lots of water weight.<br>  <br>  I can't even guess what your caloric intake should be without knowing your size and weight.|`|HI0oQriqaa	read through the questions on here . seems a lot of them are about losing weight. you know how to lose weight . everyone does . it is so simple. so go sit in a corner and think about it . it calls for a change in your lifestyle . you eat too much . you have to stop eating too much. is that so hard to figure out DUH.|`|NeQK1cNjaa	sadly, monster drinks ARE bad for you<br>  instead of laying around all day, find a active sport you like to do<br>  like if its really hot, go swimming!<br>  also, instead of eating junk food, eat something healthy, like apples <br>  if you dont really like apples, dip them in peanut butter or caramel and they will taste delicious and be healthy(well not the caramel) for you!|`|5CzWXtbiaa	Ok first off, Monster could give you heart attacks so don't drink it too often and certainly don't drink it then work out.<br>  <br>  Other than that, don't eat so much, or balance out what you eat. If you eat a whole bunch of junk food, eat a lot of healthy food the same day.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|gyGUD466aa	Monster drinks are bad for you|`|wDuBfBFdaa	First  try to only have three meals a day. Don;t let yourself have any snacks. Eat at the same time every day. NO monster drinks , try to drink mor water, and limit yourself to only three pops a week, and 1 candybar a week.  Try to enjoy drinking water, and workout everyday.  you dont have to eat before you workout, working out will give you more energy, and It shouldnt make you hungry.  Try to start small and change your routine a little bit everyday, so as not to get bored.  With a changing routine you will get the most out of your workout.  Be sure to be very strict to yourself, and keep this up even after you lose weight, to keep from gaining it back.  you can eat more snacks, after you have lost weight.Good Luck and God bless!
Ujxrpoonaa	Wow... Im sure your weight is fine for your height... |`|szVvf7Nkaa	This is what your BMI score 53.3<br>  So, you should be at least between 18.5 to 24.9. <br>  <br>  This is what the BMI score means. <br>  Underweight: below 18.5 <br>  Normal: 18.5 to 24.9 <br>  Overweight: 25 to 29.9 <br>  Obese: 30 to 39.9 <br>  Extremely obese: 40 and above <br>  <br>  For your height to be in the normal range you should weigh 136kg.<br>  I think the best think for you to do before going on any type of diet is to see your family doctor. And then you can  get into a diet program where you have someone to guide you and they can follow up on you to make sure that you are doing okay while you're losing weight.

Every time you get ready to eat something crappy, just stop for a minute and ask yourself what you want more... a healthy body and long life, or the junk food which will keep you happy for a couple of minutes.

When you walk on it, you sink into the couch, but there's still a little spring to help yourself out of it.  Very very effective.  If you don't want to walk on your couch, try setting up a trail of pillows or cushioned (NOT spring) mattresses and walk on those.

En mujeres el crecimiento es máximo hasta los 16 a?os, mientras que en los hombres puede ser hasta los 18 a?os. Una alimentación completa, con suficientes proteínas (leche, quesos, yogurt, huevo, carnes y sus derivados) y energía para estar en un peso adecuado, es lo que necesita el cuerpo para crecer de acuerdo a lo genéticamente establecido. Además, hacer ejercicio ayuda al desarrollo de los huesos y músculos. Específicamente el ejercicio llamado Pilates puede hacer aumentar la estatura porque mejora la postura, pero esto será un par de centímetros solamente. Ya que estás preocupada por tu estatura te recomiendo acudir a un endocrinólogo del crecimiento para que en base a estudios pueda determinar tus posibilidades de crecimiento y el tratamiento médico indicado.|`|64a59456cde962433d39f97607213b3daa	lamentale querer crecer y no poder...

Sometimes those things have hidden dangers that you may not be aware of, that can have a very negative effect on your body. They mess with your nervous system and is basically speeding up the process in your body and that is not how your body naturally is meant to work. You need to watch your portion size and get more exercise. Your body will respond and you will lose weight.

AA12248209	Welcome to the world of women. Lol. Everybody has stretch marks. <br>  Stretch marks are a normal part of puberty for most girls and guys. When a person grows or gains weight really quickly.<br>  <br>  THINGS TO DO!:<br>      * Some people find that sunless tanning treatments (both over-the-counter lotions and sprays and in-salon types of treatments) can help cover up stretch marks. This doesn't work for regular tanning or tanning beds, though, because stretch marks themselves are less likely to tan. And as everyone knows, the sun and tanning beds do more harm than good when it comes to the long-term health of your skin. You also can buy body makeup matched to the tone of your skin that can make stretch marks all but invisible. Although some manufacturers make these cover-up products water-resistant, makeup may not be the best solution if you'll be spending a lot of time in the water.<br>      * Speaking of pool or beach time, the good news is that current fashion favors many styles of bathing suits that also just happen to hide stretch marks. "Boy short" style suits (popular with many athletes because they don't ride up when a person moves) work well for hiding stretch marks on the buttocks and upper thighs. <br>      * Although there are tons of creams and other skin products on the market that claim to eliminate stretch marks, the truth is that most are ineffective and often costly. You can't make stretch marks go away entirely without the help of a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in treating skin problems) or plastic surgeon. These doctors may use one of many types of treatments - from actual surgery to techniques such as microdermabrasion and laser treatment - that reduce the appearance of stretch marks. These techniques are expensive and are not usually recommended for people in their teen years because they are not finished growing and their stretch marks will probably diminish over time anyway.|`|Appr57claa	As far as I know there is NO creams, ointments or oils that get rid of stretch marks, they just fade but not completely. You could try asking your local pharmarcy or GP.

Thus, if 100 women use a method that has a 12% failure rate, sometime during that year, 12 of the women will become pregnant.<br>  <br>  The most effective methods in typical use are those that do not depend upon regular user action. Surgical sterilization, Depo-Provera, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) all have failure rates of less than 1% per year for perfect use. Depo-Provera, or the shot, has a typical failure rate of 3%, while sterilization, implants, and IUDs still have a typical failure use under 1%.|`|vpya9hhOaa	if you are talking about the birth control pill, brands very.  and percentages are lessened by the inevitability of human error!  Depo (the shot) and Nuvaring (the ring) are hormonal forms that both help to minimize the human element.  (the shot is 1 shot eery 3 months, and the ring is 1 ring per month, which means less remembering and potential forgetting by the user).  I think the safest you can possibly get would be to combine your choice of hormonal method (pill, patch, ring, shot, all are 98% effective or higher with perfect use) with condom use (EVERYTIME)  that way if you do forget, you're backed up.  <br>  Check out www.plannedparenthood.org for information on these and more contracteptive options!  good luck!|`|AA12272514	it sends off a hormone which prevents the release of an egg from the ovary. all you have is the endometrium to bleed out during your period, no unfertilized egg.

Mark it down on a calendar and keep doing that until you see a general pattern. Maybe you get them every thirty days. So maybe two days before, take motrin, one in morning and in evening or whatever you usually take.  <br>  Also, if they are really really realllllyyyy bad, it could be this disorder thing that has a symptom where you get really bad cramps. I suggest going to a doctor if these cramps dibilitate you- ex. you're doubled over in pain, throwing up from pain, stay in until they're over, etc.  But if this doesn't happen, don't worry, it's just normal.

In the present study, we examined the effects of exercise training on glucose metabolism, abdominal adiposity, and adipocytokines in obese elderly. Sixteen obese men and women (age = 63 +/- 1 yr, body mass index = 33.2 +/- 1.4 kg/m2) participated in a 12-wk supervised exercise program (5 days/wk, 60 min/day, treadmill/cycle ergometry at 85% of heart rate maximum). Visceral fat (VF), subcutaneous fat, and total abdominal fat were measured by computed tomography. Fat mass and fat-free mass were assessed by hydrostatic weighing. An oral glucose tolerance test was used to determine changes in insulin resistance. Exercise training increased maximal oxygen consumption (21.3 +/- 0.8 vs. 24.3 +/- 1.0 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), P < 0.0001), decreased body weight (P < 0.0001) and fat mass (P < 0.001), while fat-free mass was not altered (P > 0.05). VF (176 +/- 20 vs. 136 +/- 17 cm2, P < 0.0001), subcutaneous fat (351 +/- 34 vs. 305 +/- 28 cm2, P < 0.03), and total abdominal fat (525 +/- 40 vs. 443 +/- 34 cm2, P < 0.003) were reduced through training. Circulating leptin was lower (P < 0.003) after training, but total adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha remained unchanged. Insulin resistance was reversed by exercise (40.1 +/- 7.7 vs. 27.6 +/- 5.6 units, P < 0.01) and correlated with changes in VF (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and maximal oxygen consumption (r = -0.48, P < 0.05) but not adipocytokines. VF loss after aerobic exercise training improves glucose metabolism and is associated with the reversal of insulin resistance in older obese men and women.<br>  PMID: 16373444 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]|`|d98205dbe0c8aeb366af1a73b03a07a0aa	I am also insulin resistant.

They also had HBP and had two children, the youngest was a toddler at the time.<br>  <br>  I think you can do it, but all of that is nothing to take lightly.  You may want to get in the best shape you can before you have kids, stay on some kind of plan while you are pregnant, and get back into shape ASAP.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise I think you might be risking your life. I think that's why the doctors are trying to tackle your health issues instead of talking about what having a baby will do to you.<br>  <br>  You may be very eager to have kids, but waiting a couple of years before you have kids so that you can deal with your health issues will let you have more years with your kids.<br>  <br>  Medication might help you start getting over your issues, but you need to do everything you possibly can to try to be healthy without the meds, because having a baby will put additional stress on your body.|`|73973a1bbf05e60d59590ca014dee183aa	With HBP you could have preeclampsia which could cause the following:<br>  Mild high blood pressure during pregnancy is not necessarily dangerous by itself. However, it is closely monitored because it can be a sign of a more serious condition, such as preeclampsia. After delivery, mild high blood pressure that has not worsened during the pregnancy and has returned to normal within 12 weeks can be termed "transient hypertension of pregnancy." <br>  Severe high blood pressure limits the blood oxygen supply to your fetus, increasing the risk for poor fetal growth, early separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placenta abruptio), and stillbirth. For this reason, you are likely to be treated with medication to lower your blood pressure if your diastolic blood pressure reading is 100 or higher (this is the second, or lower, number). <br>  Long-term (chronic) high blood pressure is a lifelong yet treatable condition. The greatest risk for pregnant women with chronic high blood pressure is their 1-in-4 chance of developing preeclampsia. 2 (When the two conditions occur together, your risk of complications from high blood pressure increases, as does your risk of complications from preeclampsia.) <br>  <br>  Preeclampsia<br>  <br>  Preeclampsia is defined as the new onset of high blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) after 20 weeks of pregnancy, usually with higher-than-normal levels of protein found in a urine sample. <br>  <br>  In its most severe form, preeclampsia is a life-threatening pregnancy problem. Although it is not well understood, preeclampsia seems to start with a placenta that doesn't grow the usual network of blood vessels deep into the uterine wall. This leads to poor blood circulation through the placenta. 3 In addition to causing mild to severe high blood pressure, preeclampsia can also cause problems with blood supply to the fetus and sometimes with the woman's liver, kidney, and brain functions. Women with severe preeclampsia can develop life-threatening seizures (eclampsia). <br>  <br>  Preeclampsia only occurs during or just after pregnancy. It affects about 5% of all pregnancies, most commonly first-time pregnancies. 4 Although preeclampsia typically lasts for up to 2 weeks after delivery, it always goes away after a pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Preeclampsia probably does not cause future high blood pressure. Instead, experts think that women who have preeclampsia also have a higher-than-normal risk of chronic high blood pressure after pregnancy or later in life<br>  <br>  These are just a few of the problems with high blood pressure during pregnancy. You could also have a preterm baby and have problems after your pregnancy with any blood pressure. <br>  <br>  With mitro-valve prolapse in pregnancy the following is what I found. <br>  Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) can vary from mild to moderate or severe and is generally tolerated well in pregnancy. In fact, it may even improve during pregnancy due to the generalized dilation of blood vessels. Most women have no symptoms of heart disease with mitral valve prolapse. In rare instances, complications such as chest pain, palpitations or a sense of a racing heartbeat, and possibly fainting can arise.<br>  <br>  Implications for the Baby<br>  <br>  Mitral valve prolapse may be caused by a congenital condition, or by a weakening of the valve due to recurrent injury and repair. Regardless of the cause, the risk for your baby inside your uterus is minimal. Most moms and babies do very well with mitral valve prolapse. However, if you become significantly symptomatic and the blood flow to your uterus, placenta, and your baby are decreased, your baby will be at risk for growth problems. In these cases, a perinatologist may evaluate your baby via ultrasound to assess his tolerance of the symptoms you are experiencing.<br>  <br>  So I think that I would sit down with the doctors and make sure that they we straight forward with me and let me know about the possibility of getting pregnant and the implications when pregnant and if they don't think that it would be a good idea than maybe you should talk to your spouse about other options of having children. I hope that this helps.|`|9ad1efd308719bdc7a672441d7407b3daa	MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE AND INSULIN RESISTANCE ARE NOT CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR CONCEPTION.BUT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE MUST BE WELL UNDER CONTROL BEFORE PLANNING FOR PREGNANCY AND YOU SHOULD BE UNDER CLOSE FOLLOW UP BY CARDIOLOGIST AND NEPHROLOGIST IN ADDITION.

Eat right get plenty of sleep, avoid drugs and alcohol and that will put you on the right track when your body starts developing.

I am an older man and the last thing I worry about is premature ejaculation.....impotence maybe, but not PE.  There are lots of techniques for treating PE - check them out on the web.  Also check any info on Tantric Sex.  Some doctors are treating PE with selective serotonin uptake inhibitor drugs - commonly used as antidepressants - drugs like Paxil, Lexapro and several others.  These drugs DO work, but there side effects such as decrease or loss of libido, which kinda depeats the purpose of taking the drug for PE.  Good Luck<br>  BTW I tried taking Lexapro for a short time to treat depression...the first time I had sex after starting the drug I went 45 minutes and never did have an orgasm - my wife loved it.  After that I had NO (zero, zip nada, non) sex drive until 2 weeks after I stop taking Lexapro.|`|330f3431a0776829e0a7cc79638a1885aa	They worry about it because as they get older it tends to happen in alot of men.

v18g1xLsaa	It sounds like your getting sick from the stress of exams. I asked my doctor about it, and it really is possible for stress to make you have physical symptoms of sickness. Or you may just be getting sick with something else because your immune system is low, becasue of increased stress this week? I would try to relax, maybe do some yoga or take a hot bath. I would also probably give my doctor a call and see what he thinks. Just try to relax and not let the stress get to you so much. Good luck on your exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.|`|06809c9ada791ec5f29fa8c8f8bef942aa	You can take some tums and some Tylenol  and lay down. you most likely ate to fast and more then you are use to eating, which can cause this feeling in your stomach.|`|1bd4201176097c30d545cb230d0d5e90aa	You may have something serious, especially with shivering.

As far as being sick and food.  The four things to think about when not wanting to throw up is BRAT foods.<br>  <br>  Bananas<br>  <br>  Rice<br>  <br>  Applesauce<br>  <br>  Toast<br>  <br>    Those 4 are easily digested by the stomach.  If you throw any of those up, you may need to abstain from eating.  You also may need to get some sleep.  That's very important.  Stay away from fatty/greasy/sugary food.  Also avoid soda and liquor.  Stick to getting some sleep, BRAT foods and drinking water.  That should help.  Good luck on your exams and if you aren't feeling well in a few days, call a doctor.  <br>  <br>  As far as why, you may be having too much stress in your life, you may be tired, you may be malnourished, it's hard to diagnos over the internet.  Hope this all helps.|`|wPZBWhh7aa	In my opinion from nursing school i would think that you have only stressed your body out over your exams.  Not only does stressing over such a big issue make you tired but it can make you sick as well when you don't eat the right foods.  I would say take some Vitamin C tablets, drink lots of water or gatorade.  Oh and get adequate amounts of sleep.  During exams time people think it is best to stay up studying all hours of the night and not getting any sleep.  But if you spread it out and get at least 6 hours of sleep you are allowing your body to recharge itself including the brain, which you will need come test time.|`|gfMpirJeaa	Better get some Theraflu and go to bed.

I myself am 13, 5'2", and 110 lbs, which is somewhere near your ideal. It all depends on your bone structure whether you appear to have more fat than you need or not.<br>  Second, I would definiely recommend making a big change in diet. I am a vegetarian, so I have eliminated some of the main sources of cholesterol and saturated fat from my diet. Though I am not encouraging you in any way to become vegetarian, I would highly recommend cutting down on big sources of fat and cholesterol, such as red meats, cheese, and any other animal products.<br>  The final thing is exercise. I understand that you're lazy- I'm 13 and I feel the same way. Just find something you like and stick to it. I am a committed dancer, not because I like the exercise aspect of it, but because I simply love it. Also, I have been doing yoga for the past two years, and it has definitely helped to keep my body in shape. At the same time, it is not very difficult to start with and it does not take much energy.

It's possible that you might feel it warm up a little, but you'll know as soon as you enter the room the MRI machine is in.  The entire room is affected, and the magnetic pull becomes stronger the close you get to it, and much weaker just feet away.  You'll know something is wrong well before anything comes tearing out of your body, and you'll just turn around and exit the MR scanning room.  At any rate, you'll never have to worry about this unless you are planning to become an MRI Tech or Radiologist - nobody else really gets close to the scanner.|`|AA10101582	You should have no problem.

Of 100 women who use ParaGard or Mirena, one or fewer will become pregnant during the first year of typical* use. Fewer than one will become pregnant with perfect** use. Fewer pregnancies occur with continued use.<br>  <br>  It is very important to remember that the IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted infections. Use a latex or female condom with the IUD to reduce the risk of infection.<br>  <br>  *Typical use refers to failure rates for women whose use is not consistent or always correct.<br>  **Perfect use refers to failure rates for those whose use is consistent and always correct."|`|516bb19115407f6847fd866f95395bb3aa	Failure of contraception is usually measured by the Pearl Index which is expressed as the failure rate per 100 woman years. Its done by dividing the number of unintended pregnancies by the total months of exposure to pregnancy and then multiplying this by 1200. I guess it sounds a bit confusing like this :) however its quite accurate. <br>  <br>  Some examples: An IUD  pearl index is around 0.5-3.0, which is very good...highly effective. It is only topped by tubal ligation. The oral combined pill is around the same value, just a little higher.  <br>  <br>  Mirenas are believe to fail slightly less than copper IUDs, but in both cases we are talking of extremely small chances, assuming its inserted correctly and there are no anatomical abnormalities or infections. <br>  <br>  Of course, an IUD won't protect you from STDs so better play it safe and keep using other methods of contraception as well. <br>  <br>  You should discuss your preoccupations with your gynaecologist. He/She is obliged to inform you about all the possible complications...but it's no harm to ask clarification! Good Luck!
9vQTIUyUaa	A tendon is a tough yet flexible band of fibrous tissue. The tendon is the structure in your body that connects your muscles to the bones. <br>  <br>  Sometimes the tendons become inflamed for a variety of reasons, and the action of pulling the muscle becomes irritating. If the normal smooth gliding motion of your tendon is impaired, the tendon will become inflamed and movement will become painful. This is called tendonitis, and literally means inflammation of the tendon.<br>  <br>  Tendonitis symptoms can feel like a strong pulling, sharp pain when moving a joint, sharp pain when lifting or carrying anything, a deep ache, or a drawing sensation that seems to follow a straight line through the muscle into the tendon. Tendonitis can make a muscle feel as if it has lost all its strength, as if it will fail if it is called upon to lift or carry weight.

He lectures, teaches and councils people worldwide.<br>  <br>  Since becoming aware of his Psychic abilities at the age of three, Gary has lived a life that few can imagine. His connection to other dimensions has given him the insight and the will to spread his knowledge and help as many people as he can...and help he does!

2eadbcc85dd71c35505e7191dc7604f0aa	When I read your question a light bulb went off!  I am a pharmacy student and we talked about a very similar condition in class this week.  It sounds like you have "sleep paralysis" with "hypnogogic hallucinations."  In English: you have an abnormal sleep-wake cycle.  There are normal cycles when you are sleeping that you are physically paralyzed.  Rarely some people can mentally become awake at these times, but their bodies don't respond.  The hypnogogic hallucinations are similar to the paralysis.  They often present as feeling like you can't move and there is someone else in the room who wants to harm you.  They are often very scary and threatening.<br>  <br>  As one of the other posters mentioned, these experiences usually happen when the person is fatigued during the day.  <br>  <br>  Both sleep paralysis and hypnogogic hallucinations are common in people with narcolepsy.  Narcolepsy isn't always what you see in the movies where someone just falls asleep standing up.  The disorder is usually attacks of sudden weakness during the day and disturbed nighttime sleep.<br>  <br>  I am not ready to diagnose you with narcolepsy, but I do think what you are experiencing would be worth seeing a doctor over.|`|125b86343426d62f4811de637ccf330baa	That has happened to me a lot, and it's really freaky!

All I can say is when you go to sleep your brain likes to play tricks on you, and yes even when you're asleep your brain is still on.  At some point you are waking up and felt your body shaking, at that point your brain signals are not working fast enough. Neurons are the brain cells that manifest all the properties in your mind.  Thats why you need to get plenty of sleep, which help your nerve neurons.

This is per international science my friend.<br>  Good Q<br>  Good luck|`|5737f0111f183aa3e07767b0362ccc9caa	A unit of energy.  But when it is not needed, the molecules that would have produced it become stored as fat.|`|AA10169531	Alternative names    Return to top <br>  <br>  Calories - diet <br>  Definition    Return to top <br>  <br>  The energy stored in food is measured in terms of calories.<br>  <br>  Technically, 1 calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Centigrade. The calorie measure used commonly to discuss the energy content of food is actually a kilocalorie or 1000 real calories. This is the amount of energy required to raise 1 kilogram of water (about 2.2 pounds) 1 degree Centigrade.<br>  <br>  Different foods contain different amounts of energy -- which is why a small piece of chocolate can have many more calories than a similarly sized piece of lettuce.<br>  <br>  However, since calories are a measure of energy, there cannot be, as some diet books claim, different types of calories. A fat calorie has the same amount of energy as a protein or carbohydrate calorie.<br>  <br>  A person's caloric need is determined using a variety of mathematical equations. Age, height, current weight, desired weight, and height are taken into account. Diet is what you eat. Dieting usually refers to eating less calories to lose weight. <br>  <br>  Function    Return to top <br>  <br>  The amount of calories in a diet refers to how much energy the diet can provide for the body. A well-balanced diet is one that delivers an adequate amount of calories while providing the maximum amount of nutrients.<br>  <br>  The body breaks down food molecules to release the energy stored within them. This energy is needed for vital functions like movement, thought, growth -- anything that you do requires the use of fuel. The body stores energy it does not need in the form of fat cells for future use.<br>  <br>  The process of breaking down food for use as energy is called metabolism. Increased activity results in increased metabolism as the body needs more fuel. The opposite is also true. With decreased activity the body continues to store energy in fat cells and does not use it up. Therefore, weight gain is the result of increased intake of food, decreased activity, or both.<br>  <br>  The nutrition labels on food packages indicate the number of calories contained in the food.<br>  <br>  Food Sources    Return to top <br>  <br>  Naturally, different foods provide different amounts of calories. Some foods, such as ice-cream, have many calories; while others, like leafy vegetables, have few.<br>  <br>  Side Effects    Return to top <br>  <br>  Inappropriate dieting (fad dieting) can lead to rebound weight gain. <br>  Altered body image can lead to anorexia nervosa or bulimia. <br>  Diets that are excessively low in calories are considered dangerous and do not result in healthful weight loss. A more desirable method of weight reduction is one that is moderate in calories and that encourages routine exercise. <br>  Children and young adults should not limit calories below the Recommended Daily Allowance because they require a certain amount of calories for growth and development. Better eating habits for the entire family often accomplish the caloric decrease that is required for a child or young adult to reach a desirable weight. <br>  Recommendations    Return to top <br>  <br>  See balanced diet.<br>  <br>  A calorie is a unit of measurement for energy. The unit's name is French and derives from the Latin calor (heat). In most fields, it has been replaced by the joule, the SI unit of energy. However, it remains in common use for the amount of energy obtained from food. Many different definitions for the calorie emerged during the 19th and 20th centuries. They fall into two classes:<br>  <br>  The small calorie or gram calorie approximates the energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 g of water by 1 °C. This is about 4.184 J. <br>  The large calorie or kilogram calorie approximates the energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 °C. This is about 4.184 kJ, and exactly 1000 small calories. <br>  In scientific contexts, the name "calorie" refers strictly to the gram calorie, and this unit has the symbol cal. SI prefixes are used with this name and symbol, so that the kilogram calorie is known as the "kilocalorie" and has the symbol kcal.<br>  <br>  Colloquially, and in nutrition and food labelling, the term "calorie" almost always refers to the kilogram calorie. This applies only to English text; if an energy measurement is given using a unit symbol then the scientific practice prevails there. A convention of capitalising "Calorie" to refer to the kilogram calorie, with uncapitalised "calorie" referring to the gram calorie, is sometimes proposed, but neither recognized in any official standards, nor commonly followed.<br>  <br>  The conversion factor between calories and joules is numerically equivalent to the specific heat capacity of liquid water (in SI units).<br>  <br>  The "calorie" has become a common household term as dietitians recommend in cases of obesity to reduce body weight by increasing exercise (energy expenditure) and reducing energy intake. Many governments require food manufacturers to label the energy content of their products, to help consumers control their energy intake. In the countries of the European Union, manufacturers of prepackaged food must label the nutritional energy of their products in both kilocalories ("kcal") and kilojoules ("kJ"). In the United States, the equivalent mandatory labels display only "Calories" (meaning kilocalories); an additional kilojoules figure is optional. The energy content of food is usually given on labels for 100 g and for a typical serving size.<br>  <br>  The amount of food energy in a particular food could be measured by completely burning the dried food in a bomb calorimeter, a method known as direct calorimetry [1]. However, the values given on food labels are not determined this way, because it overestimates the amount of energy that the human digestive system can extract, by also burning dietary fiber. Instead, standardized chemical tests and an analysis of the recipe are used to estimate the product's digestable constitutents (protein, carbohydrate, fat, etc.). These results are then converted into an equivalent energy value based on a standardized table of energy densities:<br>  <br>  food component energy density <br>  kcal/g kJ/g <br>  fat 9 37 <br>  ethanol (alcohol) 7 29 <br>  proteins 4 17 <br>  carbohydrates 4 17 <br>  organic acids 3 13 <br>  polyols (sugar-free sweeteners) 2.4 10 <br>  <br>  Other substances found in food (water, non-digestable fibre, minerals, vitamins) do not contribute to this calculated energy density.<br>  <br>  As a rough guideline, recommended daily energy intake values for young adults are: 2500 kcal/d (10 MJ/d, 120 W) for men and 2000 kcal/d (8 MJ/d, 100 W) for women. Children, sedentary and older people require less energy, physically active people more.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Versions<br>  The energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 g of water by 1 C° varies depending on the starting temperature, and is in any case difficult to measure precisely. Accordingly there have been several definitions of the calorie:<br>  <br>  15 °C calorie: the amount of energy required to warm 1 g of air-free water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C at a constant pressure of 101.325 kPa (1 atm). Experimental values of this calorie ranged from 4.1852 J to 4.1858 J. The CIPM in 1950 published a mean experimental value of 4.1855 J, noting an uncertainty of 0.0005 J. <br>  20 °C calorie: the amount of energy required to warm 1 g of air-free water from 19.5 °C to 20.5 °C at a constant pressure of 101.325 kPa (1 atm). This is about 4.182 J. <br>  4 °C calorie: the amount of energy required to warm 1 g of air-free water from 3.5 °C to 4.5 °C at a constant pressure of 101.325 kPa (1 atm). <br>  Mean calorie: 1/100 of the amount of energy required to warm 1 g of air-free water from 0 °C to 100 °C at a constant pressure of 101.325 kPa (1 atm). This is about 4.190 J <br>  International Steam Table Calorie (1929): (1/860) W h = (180/43) J exactly. This is approximately 4.1860 J. <br>  International Steam Table Calorie (1956): 1.163 mW h = 4.1868 J exactly. This definition was adopted by the Fifth International Conference on Properties of Steam (London, July 1956). <br>  Thermochemical calorie: 4.184 J exactly. <br>  IUNS calorie: 4.182 J exactly. This is a definition implied by the Committee on Nomenclature of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences (date and reference needed). <br>  The two perhaps most popular definitions used in older literature are the "15 °C calorie" and the "thermochemical calorie". Since the many different definitions are a source of confusion and error, all calories are now deprecated in favour of the SI unit for heat and energy: the joule (J).<br>  <br>  In nutrition, the difference between these calorie definitions is of no practical relevance. This is, because nutritional calories are not measured amounts of energy, but are calculated from food composition. Such calculations use internationally agreed conventional conversion factors, which are generously rounded values that roughly approximate the average energy density of a large number of different food samples. The exact composition of agricultural products varies far more than the less than 0.1% difference between the above definitions of the calorie as a physical energy measure.|`|9c4ba0977879fe7e5ac8296ea78e9de7aa	unit of heat energy in the metric system. The measurement of heat is called calorimetry. The calorie, or gram calorie, is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of pure water 1°C. The kilocalorie, or kilogram calorie, is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of pure water 1°C; it is equal to 1,000 cal. The kilocalorie is used in dietetics for stating the heat content of a food, i.e., the amount of heat energy that the food can yield as it passes through the body; in this context, the kilocalorie is usually called simply the calorie. The amount of heat energy needed to effect a 1°C temperature increase in 1 gram of water varies with temperature (see heat capacity); thus the temperature range over which the heating takes place must be stated to define the calorie precisely. The 15° calorie, or normal calorie, is widely used in chemistry and physics; it is measured by heating a 1-gram water sample from 14.5°C to 15.5°C at 1 atmosphere pressure. The 4° calorie, also called the small calorie or therm, is measured from 3.5°C to 4.5°C (water is most dense at 3.98°C); the large calorie, or Calorie, is equivalent to 1,000 small calories. The average value of the calorie in the range 0°C to 100°C is called the mean calorie; it is 1/100 of the energy needed to heat 1 gram of water from its melting point to its boiling point. The calorie may also be defined by expressing its value in some other energy units. The 15° calorie is equivalent to 4.185 joules (J), 1.162×10-6 kilowatt-hours, 3.968×10-3 British thermal units, and 3.087 foot-pounds; the 4° calorie equals 4.204 J; and the mean calorie equals 4.190 J. Two other calories sometimes used are the International Steam Table calorie, equal to 4.187 J, and the thermochemical calorie, equal to 4.184 J. When the calorie is used for precision measurement of heat energy, the particular calorie being used must be specified.|`|AA12363254	Calorie is a unit equal to the kilocalorie, used to express the heat output of an organism and the fuel or energy value of food.

There is no cure.  However there is treatment only for now.  Acne can occur at any age and be more or less intense at different times and ages.  Medical studies have not proven yet if acne is hereditary or not.  For acne of the chest and back there are over the counter medicines and prescription meds available for treatment.  Wash the affected area daily with an over the counter product that contains salicylic acid like Neutrogena body wash for example.  This should take care of breakouts.  If condition worsens or over the counter products do not seem to help, a dermatologist will possible write a script for meds that go into your bloodstream to fight off this bacteria.  These meds have a 90% sucess rate at stopping acne symptoms.  Again, there are no meds available that cures acne but will make it seem that a person does not have it.|`|0314b7a167d34cf5ec12cf0dfe2d668eaa	I'm not sure, but my Mom has acne on her back and she's uh, well a lot older than you.

Ne pensez-vous qu'il s'agit de qualités essentielles ?<br>  <br>  Si sa timidité est excessive, seul lui peut effectuer un travail sur lui-même afin de dépasser cette timidité, en se faisant aider éventuellement d'un psychothérapeute. <br>  <br>  Mais, de toute évidence, votre fille n'est pas à protéger, elle est à féliciter d'avoir choisi un homme disposant de qualités essentielles pour une vie de couple heureuse.|`|0a835f720c18c6ac9b1d0c0333431a60aa	t'inquiète pas . il seront deux à penser se protéger|`|14abfa236a45097706d14fb884bc0817aa	la laisser vivre sa vie.

Au contraire, il faut faire attention à ce qu'elle ne se retrouve pas dans une situation sociale et/ou financière difficile, où elle devrait assumer à elle seule toute l'économie du ménage pendant que son mari vit à ses crochets.<br>  Bien s?r, le problème c'est que si vous vous mettez en conflit ouvert avec son mari, ou si vous dites à votre fille que son mari est un incapable, elle risque de prendre son parti et de se retourner contre vous.<br>  Donc à mon avis la solution c'est plut?t de ne pas dire à votre fille que vous désapprouvez son choix (même si vous le pensez)  et de ne pas dévaloriser son mari devant elle, mais de lui faire comprendre que la porte est ouverte et que vous êtes prête à l'écouter si elle veut parler des difficultés qu'elle recontre. <br>  Vous pourriez également lui donner des conseils pour qu'elle aide son mari à surmonter sa timidité, par exemple lui dire qu'il s'inscrive dans des activités de groupe voire qu'il aille voir un psy.<br>  Enfin, vous pouvez suggérer à votre fille pour qu'elle fasse aussi un peu preuve d'autorité et qu'elle mette son mari devant ses responsabilités, car s'il veut fonder une famille alors il faut aussi qu'il fasse le nécessaire pour assurer la situation matérielle.<br>  Mais encore une fois tout cela doit à mon avis se passer dans l'ouverture et le dialogue, et non dans les conflits ou les reproches qui ne peuvent qu'empirer la situation. <br>  Bon courage.|`|f6e697fdf39512849d6a2e022586ab45aa	Que faire....

It also has very little calories, if at all. So it can be included in a healthy diet, but you also have to cut down on what you eat and more around more.

But when most people say they want to lose weight, what they really mean is they want to lose weight without altering their current lifestyle. They want to lose weight without changing the foods that they eat, or without getting up off the couch, turning off the television, and engaging in regular physical exercise. Not surprisingly, there is a huge market that offers shortcuts to weight loss through cosmetic surgery, diet pills, nutritional supplements, and various diets -- such as the Atkins Diet.<br>  <br>  There's a growing group of people who leap from one weight loss fad to another, in search of the one thing that's going to finally help them lose weight without having to alter the foods they eat. People don't want to give up their soft drinks; they don't want to give up pizza, and ice cream, and fast food. And they sure don't have time to go out and exercise on a regular basis. So the shortcuts market is absolutely astounding -- $9.4 billion was spent last year on cosmetic surgery alone, and hundreds of millions more were spent on weight loss pills, fat burning nutritional supplements, and low-carb foods. It's a tremendous market, and the public seems to be more than willing to keep spending money on these items, even though the real answers are to be found in something entirely different.<br>  <br>  The reality of weight loss is that there are no shortcuts! You can have cosmetic surgery to remove fat from your thighs, or the back of your arms, but if you continue eating the way you've been eating, your body will just deposit the fat somewhere else on your body -- usually in a place that looks even stranger than when it was on your hips. Even if the cosmetic surgery works out for you, it doesn't alter your blood chemistry, your cardiovascular health, or your level of physical fitness. Meaning that you are just as unhealthy after the surgery as you were before, even though you may physically show less body fat. Something similar is true with foods as well. Many people continue to eat a diet high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and obesity-promoting ingredients, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Then in an attempt to lose weight, they will take a couple of weight loss pills each day, and hope that those pills will some how counteract the entire day of eating unhealthy, obesity-promoting foods. It just doesn't work this way.<br>  <br>  If you really want to lose weight, you've got to do two things. First you have to avoid foods that promote obesity and weight-gain. These are the foods that are consumed by the vast majority of Americans, and are the ones that are the most popular in grocery stores and restaurants. Any food that's processed or manufactured is very likely to promote obesity, or some other chronic disease. Foods made with refined white flour or refined sugar, for example, will undoubtedly alter your blood sugar levels and tell your body to start storing fat. Foods high in saturated animal fats, such as red meat, or foods that are high in hydrogenated oils, like margarine or shortening, will also pack on the body fat, and harm your cardio-vascular health at the same time. Achieving a healthy body weight absolutely requires taking these foods out of your diet for the rest of your life. You can have either soft drinks and processed foods, or a healthy body weight -- but not both. In fact, much of the foods available today in the national food supply are simply incompatible with a healthy body weight, no matter how much surgery you undergo, and no matter how many weight loss supplements you attempt to take.<br>  <br>  The other part of the equation here is physical exercise. The human body simply won't shed excess body fat without engaging in regular physical exercise. Physical exercise gives you a much higher metabolism; it helps you burn calories, even while you're sitting or sleeping. It also increases your lean body mass -- especially when you engage in strength training -- and that results in even more calories being burned when you are at rest. Physical exercise, in fact, modifies your body chemistry in a way that helps your body better use refined foods such as breads or pasta. When you eat those foods without engaging in physical exercise, you're automatically going to add weight. But when you have an extremely fit body that engages in regular exercise, such as jogging, swimming, walking, or biking, you can get away with eating a few processed foods. But still you have to limit your intake of processed foods if you want to maintain a healthy body weight.<br>  <br>  In my own case, I engage in rather vigorous physical exercise several times per week, typically putting in 10 hours of exercise each week. And even then, I don't allow myself to eat any breads or pasta or refined carbohydrates of any kind. I don't consume breakfast cereals; I don't drink fruit-drinks or consume soft drinks. And what I've found is that if I eat a piece of bread or have a sandwich, then those refined carbohydrates alter my blood sugar in a way that makes me extremely hungry three or four hours later. If I had eaten a high protein meal, or a meal high in healthy fats and fibers, I wouldn't be hungry so quickly. So it is these processed foods that are in fact causing the obesity in the first place. And consuming diet pills or weight loss supplements simply isn't the answer to long-term weight loss. The answer is to look at your lifestyle, examine what you're doing wrong that needs to be corrected, and then have the courage to make the changes that will bring you into a healthy body weight and keep you there for life.|`|54e8d622388b04c03cffe3f3f4bcee0daa	you can take calories less sugar in your drinks don't only walk on treadmill but have a regular walk in open area|`|AA11151902	You might find these resources useful:<br>  <a href="http://www.aacl.net/weight-loss/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aacl.net/weight-loss/index.ht...</a>

5d33e8b1817c79bb0b5cc75a6cf91f84aa	Dear Kristen; Biology and nature will come at it's own pace.  You will start your period and probably soon.  I understand, you wanting to start your menstrual cycle and this is completely normal.  Also the discharge your experiencing is normal.  Don't worry, unless an irritation, itch, odor, or additional symptoms appear.  You could have a very low grade yeast infection, which is harmless, eating a cup of yogurt a day for a few days should clear it up, for it restores the normal flora to your vagina, that's if you even have a low grade yeast infection.  Also If your terribly trouble by not having started your period, talk to your mom and see if you can go see an ob/gyn doctor.  I know it's embarrassing and not something many of us look forward to, however it sure answers a lot of questions you may have, and no time like the present to search for a ob/gyn you feel comfortable with.  Thanks for the opportunity to address such a sensitive question.|`|589bd0c75644f69916a6625eb75cb262aa	periods are not fun to have, especially having it every month with the pms and all... the most that i hate about periods is the cramps and heavy bleeding but periods vary in how much you bleed and how long you have it... just enjoy that you don't have it and then after you get it then you will wish you didn't have it. hope i didn't scare or confuse you.|`|8t2xix9Yaa	yes it is kinda annoying to have it...and its not that big of a deal if ur only 13 cuz i got mine when i was 13.. one of the reasons mine didnt come til i was older was becuz i was a bit underweight, so if ur underweight, thats the problem. ya gotta be at least 100 pounds ta get ur period, so if ur that desperate then i guess gain weight er something?? sry if my answer sounded stupid.....;-)|`|1848c606ec57cd6ca132ec3ec8b3bc42aa	dont worry all girls start at different times, it Will happen, believe me and someday your wish you never started, and the clear white liquid is totally normal, just being a girl, hope this helps|`|AA10925430	hey look i was anxious to get them too i gottem last yr when i was 13, but my mum was 11 when she got hers, when i gottem, i hated them trust me its not fun! <br>  <br>  if u ever see a brown mark on ur undies thats proably your period|`|c6b3dbe0b46b4d1beb8cb3443d6a3519aa	maybe see a doctor|`|cede12bf736f1426517d23f2b1acbd66aa	hony, there r no sign u cant rush it i was 12 when i started (im 19 now almost 20 )  i  just didint expect itmy fiend had hers at 8 every 1 is different it ill come|`|b2be12f18756f34814f6ef1dcafbf8f8aa	nope you cant make it come <br>  you have until your 16<br>  wait it out :)<br>  dont feel left out when you start your periods u wished you didnt|`|be494a9b791eec33a4781bc550500b63aa	you cant make it come out<br>  when it comes it comes theres nothing you can do about it.....trust me once you get it your gonna wish you never had it b4<br>  people are different no one is the same <br>  so just wait it'll come sooner or later|`|c617ea781d292035d5e58c93ad4757e6aa	you want your period?!? i'm almost thirteen and i don't have it yet. your friends are right, it is annoying. you want to get your period as late as it is healthy for you.

This process can be repeated multiple times throughout the day. Use ice at the time of injury and for 1-2 days afterward to reduce pain and swelling. Be sure to take breaks between applications, and do not apply the ice directly to the skin. <br>  Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to reduce pain. Only use these medications as directed. <br>  Take an over-the-counter nasal decongestant to aid in breathing through the nostrils. <br>  Be sure to read warning labels associated with these medications. <br>  These medications should not be used for more than 3 days. <br>  Elevate the head, especially when sleeping, to avoid increased swelling of the nose. Prop the head up with pillows or lift the head of the bed by placing large blocks or phone books under the mattress. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Best of Luck

Psychological impotence can often be helped by almost anything that the patient believes in; there is a very strong placebo effect.A useful and simple way to distinguish between physiological and psychological impotence is to determine whether the patient ever has an erection. If never, the problem is likely to be physiological; if sometimes (however rarely), it is more likely to be psychological. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental diseases (DSM-IV) has included a listing for impotence.<br>  Normal erections during sleep and in the early morning suggest a psychogenic cause, while loss of these erections may signify underlying disease, often cardiovascular in origin. Other factors leading to erectile dysfunction are diabetes mellitus (causing neuropathy) or hypogonadism (decreased testosterone levels due to disease affecting the testicles or the pituitary gland).|`|W8pEdLruaa	Everything you need to know on ed is located on this web site in a easy to read manner.

27d984cffcdc89fdac8b54891c0f46d9aa	Cut down the calories to 2000 or so and stay at that level forever.  This may require a change in eating habits.<br>  <br>  Your weight is a function of calories intake (e.g. eating) and calories used (e.g. exercise).<br>  <br>  It might be easier for you to increase your level of activity (exercise) to burn the calories for losing weight if you wish to maintain your current eating habits.  However, since it appears that you want to lose weight fast, then cutting the calories and exercising is the fastest way to go.  And this means that your eating habits and activity level will have to change forever; otherwise, you will just gain it back.<br>  <br>  Just don't drop the calorie intake down to 1500 or 1200 or 900.  That's starving.  Unhealthy.  It will make things worse in the long run.<br>  <br>  Is there a best way to cut calories?  <br>  <br>  General rule is -- Lower fat intake.  Lower carbohydrate intake.  Keep protein level high (or higher if you aren't getting enough already).  <br>  <br>  About a gram of protein per 1.5 pounds of body weight -- your desired body weight, not how much you weigh now -- sounds about right for people not interested in building or maintaining large muscles.  That's a minimum of 320 calories from protein.  The rest (1680) will come from carbs and fats. <br>  <br>  Assuming a 15/85 fat-carb gram ratio, that translates to about 53 grams of fat and 300 grams of carbs per day, to go along with the 80 grams of protein for someone who wishes to weigh 120 pounds.  This will get you to the 2000 calorie limit.  Total mass of food is 53+300+80 = 433 grams.  That's approximately a pound of food per day.  The more you cut fat, the more grams of carbs and protein you can eat since fat has more than twice the calories of carbs and protein.<br>  <br>  If I used a 30/70 ratio, then that translates to 91.6 grams of fat, 213.8 grams of carbs and 80 grams of protein.  Total mass of food is 385.4 grams to meet the 2000 calorie limit as compared to the 433 grams above. More fat means less food to eat and still follow the 2000 calorie limit.  Thus, cutting down fat does allows you to eat more food.<br>  <br>  Just follow the general rule, the details don't matter.|`|40fb7149500145c2aa3349080d776bd9aa	you are more susceptible to gaining the weight back if you loose it quickly. weight loss is all about changing your eating habits. if u do a quick fad diet, u gain it back because your eating habits havent changed. to just get rid of some quick water pounds, just drink lots of water to wash away toxins and eat fruit for a couple of days, nothing else. then go back to your normal dieting, eating only in moderation. whatever u eat, eat half then eat the rest later.|`|8dcff4d465ee0159f2f617b0a7b4d22caa	starve your self.<br>  or diet and extersise|`|5ef55a5d54fef94dbedc7b341d2861f1aa	Your body will not drop the fat until you get healthy.

I think in our generation parents can no longer raise their children and make the choices for their kids. Society wants to raise peoples kids to what they think is better for them. If they think eating healthy in school is going to keep kids from being fat... why are there so many fat kids still?|`|221c18139bc5e0fd18716f967bc198b1aa	i think schools have the responsibility to provide healthy foods that will aid their educational development and physical well-being since they want you to test well and pass gym.  plus in reality i dont think giving kids the absolute choice to choose their foods is even feasible because we all know they the majority of american students will go for the junk food.<br>  <br>  anything else should be allowed, but brought from home.  or perhaps only allowed to be bought with a healthy meal.<br>  <br>  YOU are 106 because you're teenaged and you metabolism is high.

The kids seem to like gatoraid too.|`|7ZqeN1hjaa	bring your own pop|`|d52e3093ea74ab65e562bb3732a1b2ceaa	Yes, it is right.  Kids don't always make the right choices for themselves, so it is up to the adults to make healthy choices for them, whenever they can.  If you hadn't eaten junk food in the first place, you would not notice at all if the fries were baked or fried.  The issue is not just obesity, though that is a factor, the main issue is heart health and clogged arteries and high cholesterol and diabetes later in life.    I'm sure you will still eat some things that are not good for you, but by not having it available to you where you spend most of your time, you've invested in your future health w/out having to give it a thought.  That's what we adults are supposed to do, is take care of our young.|`|f593a3dbf5a630b51d8645895acd5d4aaa	yes|`|u0g0uIaBaa	If it's part of law yes, if not no.|`|42c1974d425360f00a87226743d5f4feaa	If you eat a healthy balanced diet, you don't have to worry.  I think that too many teens are making poor choices.  I don't think diet items are a good idea, but healthy choices are.  Diet sodas are not healthy and shouldn't be in schools either.  Milk, Juices, even coffee and tea in moderation are things that can have health benefits.  Low fat meals are a great idea because so many teens are not eating well.  If you are concerned about losing weight, talk to your doctor about how to eat a balanced diet.  This will help you maintain your weight rather than gaining or losing.  <br>  Schools are just trying to do what is best for the kids, and like it or not you are still kids, to some extent.|`|5072e4f1282aa0c42e190015b81a229faa	Yes, yes, yes. School should be about teaching you to take care of your body - not just your brain... and USING your brain when it comes to taking care of your body. Why on Earth do they have Health class if they serve and sell the kind of fattening garbage that they do?<br>  <br>  Serving the absolute crap that they serve goes against everything it means to be given the responsibility of raising our youth. Letting it continue on the way it is is the equivalent of raising the white flag and saying, "I like how kids today are so fat. Let it continue, and let it get worse. Let us decide."

Shingles is caused by the dormant chicken pox virus in your spinal cord. It spreads along a nerve outward from the spine, and curves around the front on one side of your body.

Don't feel pressurised to lose weight quickly. Make a plan, seek help from a doctor and stick to it. You can achieve whatever you put your mind to. That is something pills can never do for you. Next time you look in the mirror if you don't like what you see then promise yourself you'll change it in the healthiest way possible. Losing weight is hard but you have to look after your health. What good do you achieve losing weight quickly? You'd look like a zombie. Weight loss should be slow, and when you look in the mirror and see those changes you should be proud of yourself, not some ******** chemist. good luck.

Any of<br>  those things might be a sign of an infection, and should be checked out.|`|PurehzDyaa	yeah, it's normal! after ejaculation when the sperm is left untouch for 1 or more hours, you'll see that its white color will vanish. It has something to do with the fabric of your underwear and the contact with the skin.

Trust me, i tried it myself!

AA11546973	A person wanting to become a psychiatrist must complete high school and college before entering medical school. While there is no requirement for a particular major, college students headed for medical school take required courses in the biological and physical sciences (general and organic chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics) as well as liberal arts courses. The prospective psychiatrist may also study social and psychological sciences and psychobiology. Most psychiatrists and other physicians feel that a liberal arts college education is the best preparation for medical school.<br>  <br>  In addition to chemistry, biochemistry and physiology, students take courses in psychiatry, behavioral science, and neuroscience in the first two years of medical school. In the last two years, students are assigned to a psychiatry clerkship. They take care of patients with mental illnesses in the hospital and in outpatient settings. They also have an opportunity to work with medical and surgical patients who may have psychiatric problems or who have difficulty coping with their illnesses. Because modern psychiatry places special emphasis on the relationship between mind and body, students pay special attention to issues of stress and physical illness, prevention and behavior change, in addition to learning to care for severely mentally ill patients. Newly graduated physicians take written examinations for a state license to practice medicine. After graduation, doctors spend the first year of residency training in a hospital taking care of patients with a wide range of medical illnesses. The psychiatrist-in-training then spends at least three additional years in a psychiatric residency learning the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses, gaining valuable skills in various forms of psychotherapy and in the use of psychiatric medicines and other treatments.<br>  <br>  After completing their residency training, most psychiatrists take a voluntary examination given by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, to become a "board certified" psychiatrist.|`|14ad394512d542c10b924db2e8b09cb7aa	A Psychiatrist is a medical doctor, or an MD.

There are also grants available through the MS foundations that may be able to help as well, but I believe these are localized so you may have to get in touch with your local resources. Good luck with this hun, I pray for the best. I've seen patients come through with MS and it is not an easy thing to deal with at all. The patients have a very difficult time dealing with everything all at once.|`|jU4xZF2Kaa	Write to the ADA and ask who has been granted funds in your area.

You should get a copy of the dental treatment which should be listed in sequence (from immediate, emergency work which stabilizes the mouth), to more intermediate and long term care.  In some states, dental care for child and adults is available through Medicaid, a federal-state program designed to provide medical assistance for persons with low household income. Information about this program can be obtained from your state or county department of public welfare. You should contact them to see, presenting the treatment plan to see if you qualify.  While state funded programs has l;imitations on the type of dental work that is performed, the important thing is to stabilize what is already going on so that further damage is prevented.  If you do not qualify for this type of aid, I would suggest using the services of a dental school and work slowly with them to first 1)stabilize the mouth - ask for a payment plan for this section only.  Then see if you can get some grants or participate in research programs related to your childs need.  Learn more about how to get free dental work here: <a href="http://www.dentalclinicmanager.com/discounted-dental-plan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dentalclinicmanager.com/disco...</a><br>  <br>  Joining a dental plan is also a great idea.  You pay for a significantly discounted dental fee with a dentist who has contracted with the plan to provide care to you.  I personally use the services of Dentalplan.com and with a promotional coupon code (vote25), saved an additional 25% off the $119.00 cost.  The rates are too good to be true. You can even review the fees you would pay and the dentists who are in your area before you join the plan.

If you can't lift a weight at least 5 times with strictlly controled form than you are just fooling around, stroking your ego and not on a path to serious strength gains or toward making good gains in mass.  Only very occasionally would sets below five reps ever be recommended and even then it would only be at the culmination of a 7-10 week powerlifting program where target reps start near 8-10 and gradually decrease as weight gradually increases and even then such a plan would not be the way you would want to lift all the time.

The only thing that I have on my native side is my chiselled cheek bones. I'm not saying it in a cocky way at all. Look at johnny depp(he also has native heritage). He's like me in that it's genetics that we have almost no fat in our faces. Now, if you want to tighten your face up quickly, I can show you something I've SEEN Top models do before a shoot or special occasion. It is very safe but temporary. Buy some PREPARATION H and apply very little around your jaw line and under your jaw.Massage it as it were lotion the night before. This will tighten up your skin ALITTLE. It's not a miracle but it does work in the model and bodybuilding industry. If you want very noticeable changes then think about exercising and dieting safely. DO NOT starve yourself.

baa557cef234a37bb809caadfb9425b3aa	C’est le trouble sexuel masculin le plus fréquent, souvent confondu avec l’impuissance par le patient. L’érection est normale mais l’éjaculation se produit prématurément, parfois même avant la pénétration, entra?nant la disparition de l’érection. Ce n'est pas une maladie à proprement parler, mais un phénomène "réflexe" qui toucherait plus de 30 % des hommes. En fait, c’est une difficulté à contr?ler les sensations annonciatrices de l’éjaculation et de l’orgasme Honteux de ne pas assurer, de ne pas être performants, les éjaculateurs précoces sont souvent réticents à en parler. <br>  <br>  On parle d'éjaculation prématurée quand l'éjaculation survient trop vite. La notion d'un temps minimum n'a pas cours. Qu'elle ait lieu avant la pénétration ou 5 minutes après, le problème est le même, il n'y a pas de contr?le.<br>  Il ne s'agit pas d'une maladie à proprement parler. L'homme qui éjacule rapidement fonctionne sexuellement bien… même trop bien. Ses réactions sexuelles sont rapides et dans notre monde c'est souvent une qualité d'avoir de bons réflexes. <br>  L'éjaculation prématurée peut être :<br>  ? Primaire si elle a toujours été présente dans la sexualité de l'homme ; <br>  ? Secondaire si elle survient après un temps de sexualité sans problème. <br>  Mais la distinction n'est pas toujours si facile. Parfois, le moment crucial n'intervient pas trop t?t, sans avoir pour autant le contr?le du réflexe éjaculatoire. Ainsi ces hommes ne s'estiment éjaculateurs prématurés que dans un second temps, lorsque cette belle mécanique n'est plus synchrone. Il ne s'agit pas d'éjaculation secondaire pour autant, car leur manque de contr?le dès le début de leur vie sexuelle permet de les diagnostiquer comme souffrant d'éjaculation prématurée primaire.<br>  <br>  L’éjaculation précoce est un problème psychologique bénin qui peut être facilement guéri dans la majorité des cas. La guérison ne s’obtient cependant que si les deux partenaires sont motivés et prêts à suivre quelques séances de " rééducation ". Cette rééducation consiste à réapprendre à percevoir les signes de l’excitation et à retarder l’éjaculation. L’éjaculation prématurée peut retentir sur les relations sexuelles et entra?ner une anxiété qui elle-même peut entra?ner de réels troubles de l’érection.<br>  <br>  En espérant avoir répondu à ta question…<br>  <br>  Amicalement…|`|4461ed21df7e31de54fdd0308bb4b270aa	branle toi avant de retrouver ton amoureuse|`|PQAtenbAaa	tu as une autre question?|`|24a2d8f26ada7d973917deb45ac14954aa	creme emla une heure avant sur le prepuce ou paroxetine un comprimes tous les jours|`|HPoIbUzIaa	Je te conseille d'acheter la creme Emla.

Disons que si vous en avez la volonté,  40 à 90 jours à raison d'une séance journalière. Ensuite il vous sera plus facile de contr?ler la montée du plaisir et donc de réguler votre éjaculation ..Mais, aussi,  un bon conseil ne negligez pas les préliminaires et faites monter le plaisir de  votre femme sans aucune pénetration vous avez des mains et une bouche servez vous en . Cela vous permettra de lui donner de l'avance sur sa montée de plaisir et à la penetration , avec votre attention, vous monterez au 7 eme ciel ensemble .. <br>  Je vous dis pas comme votre femme sera aux anges car dans votre cas le déphasage peut, à terme,  vous donner du soucis dans votre couple ..|`|LO9AafYBaa	précausse ????<br>  <br>  le près des causses ??<br>  <br>  le pré des cosses ???<br>  <br>  le pré d'écosse ???<br>  <br>  ah non.... précoce !!<br>  <br>  faut peut être se branler plusieurs fois par jour?|`|PPfx0GAdaa	Allez consulter votre médecin, c'est son job et lui saura vous diriger vers un spécialiste si besoin...|`|kAhYx3IFaa	penser a brigite bardot
8577157122e0020b42a7c783e316c195aa	Laying flat on the bench is called flat dumbell benchpress, a good mass builder for the middle and lower muscles of the chest. Moving the bench to an incline position and doing the same is called incline dumbell benchpress, another mass builder which targets the upper chest muscles along with some of the neck. You can also do flat or incline flyes. This is where you lay on the bench and put both dumbells together, arms extended 100% straight above your head and then bending your elbows, bring your arms down to where the dumbells are parallel to the side of your chest, and then back up to the starting position. Do more reps of these since they're for defenition, not mass.<br>  Seated or standing dumbell curls work great for your biceps, just keep your back straight and try not to arch it. Also try hammer curls for the biceps. Instead of turning your palm up while holdind the dumbell, hold it with your palms directly facing your body, and then curl the weight just like a normal curl. This helps work the lower part of the biceps, right above the triceps. Hope this helps you out.|`|3HqAg31Paa	flyes and incline presses for pecs.  and of course curls for biceps. find a harder way to do em, not easier.!|`|1NwzCtfpaa	lay down with your arms stretched out to the side then pull them above you... like a butterfly... i think that will work

fceff0ee3635e88acc3bd4620ef00ff3aa	Well, think about it. Is it better for you to exercise more or less? Do you burn more calories exercising more or less? Don't worry about recovery time unless you're physically injured (soreness doesn't count!)... working through the pain will make you stronger in the long run.<br>  Ideally, you should work out intensely 3/7 days and lightly the other four.
fceff0ee3635e88acc3bd4620ef00ff3aa	Running. It absolutely sucks while you're doing it, but you'll see fast results. Have you ever seen a chubby distant runner? Start slowly and build up, both your speed and distance. And don't give up. For a 5'6" guy, I would say you shouldn't go any lower than 135. You'd probably look very healthy at 140-145, though.<br>  As far as your diet, try to consume around 2000 calories a day. Limit refined sugars (desserts, sugary cereals, white bread) and drink lots of water. You're supposed to drink at least a half gallon a day.

bP960sWXaa	First thing you should do is have them cleaned to remove any buildup (stain, tartar, plaque or left over orthodontic cement) to make sure that isn't part of the problem. Then let your gums react to the lack of braces, usually they get swollen with the braces and if they are and you whiten them it could irritate the gums or you would end up with areas that the whitener didn't reach. Then I would try the Crest Whitestrips since most of my patients have had some measure of success. Dont' brush before putting them on and don't drink or eat anything dark (soda, coffee, tea) for 1/2 hour after since the teeth will pick up the stain. <br>  Best of luck and wear your retainers!<br>  JAMRDH -a dental hygienist|`|oQiiPB9baa	u can get whitening toothpastes. peroxide works but i am not sure of the proper way of doing it.|`|fceff0ee3635e88acc3bd4620ef00ff3aa	Just dilute some hydrogen peroxide with warm water (about half and half is fine) and gargle it in your mouth after you brush for about a minute. It won't harm your tooth enamel and it works pretty well. You'll probably see results in a week.<br>  Also, don't try until you get your braces off, because the peroxide could damage your braces.

bVHnNqzBaa	I have NF1 (neurofibramatosis) and am a pheochromocytoma survivor (no MEN for those doctors out there). NF1 is untreatable and the worst of it is all those little cafe au lait spots or small bumps. I do not take my shirt off in public and have been asked all sorts of questions, from what is that to is that AIDS? People can be mean. I feel for you. Keep up your courage and don't worry what other people may say.

Cataracts do not cause eye irritation. Cataracts are located within the eye lens, not on the cornea where Syd is experiencing irritation.<br>  <br>  Treating the eye is best done by not panicing and letting the system heal itself if possible. Most likely Syd needs a good night's rest and eye relief from the computer. I know you all hate to hear that because we love her on Answers.<br>  <br>  If the problem persists, she may want to try some allergy relief or Visine over the counter eye drops. If the problem continues to persist, then she may want to visit her optometrist for prescription relief. If the problem is still causing discomfort and degenerative vision, then she should see an ophthalmologist. During all this she should be having sex with me.<br>  <br>  edit: Oh no! We just lost Syd!

AA11020187	Ovarian cancer is very dangerous and we have not yet learned how to manage it well. The 5-year survival rate for stage III-IV has remained as low as 12% for more than 30 years now. Tumors of low malignant potential tend to occur most often in premenopausal women and remain confined to the ovary for long periods of time, but even with this diagnosis I would not risk putting off treatment for more than 6 months and I cannot imagine her doctor would agree with this. This being said, I would leave the advising to her doctors. They are the best ones to advise her anyway. If you say anything you run the risk of alienating your son. If they are old enough to get married they are old enough to make their own decisions. I hope everything works out well for all of you.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	You shouldn't advise her of anything unless she asks your opinion.  It is a very personal decision that she and your son must make.<br>  She may want to feel and look her best at the wedding, and is worried that treatment is going to make her very sick.<br>  <br>  If she asks your opinion - I'd suggest that she get married this weekend! Holding off on treatment for 6-7 months doesn't sound like a good idea!|`|IX6dQdP0aa	Putting off treatment will allow the cancer to spread to other areas and may become terminal.

When I'm anxious I get dizzy: this is partly because I lose my appetite and so my blood sugar falls, but also because there are so many chemicals/hormones rushing through my body, list adrenaline. A good diet and some relaxation techniques should help, especially breathing exercises. <br>  But it might also help you to read about depersonalisation. It's very common with anxiety.

Don't hide your face with your hair either, I couldn't tell because of the shadows, are your eyebrows defined? Keep the natural shape of our eyebrows because they look like they really are nice. Its hard to tell from the pic what type of complexion you have, but it appears that your skin is smooth? I would stay away from alot of makeup. Natural look all the way. You have amazing features, make sure you do what you can to create a better image of yourself as a person. That's where it is going to matter. Its not what you look like on the outside that matters its what looks good on the inside, fortunately for you, you do have a beautiful face, once you feel better about your self everything will fall into place.

7fXpLlhBaa	You need to start listening to music. The Beatles, Coldplay, Josh Groban- whatever you find soothing. You also need to take a breather- take time out of your day to relax, whether that is doing absolutely nothing and breathing or taking a bath or a shower. Also, try not to eat or drink anything that has excessive caffeine in it- stay away from coffee or red bull. They might be triggering and accelerating your stress. The last thing you want is your body to be be going full throttle- when I've ever experienced a panic attack I noticed that it was also on a day that I drank a lot of coffee. <br>  <br>  The most important thing? Know that life isn't an emergency... the littlest things really don't matter in the grand scheme of life so convince your mind to take it easy and relax. :-)|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Remember to take time to yourself each day.

I have to keep telling myself that no matter how much I stress or worry it won't change a thing. It won't solve the problem, get the bills paid or fix the economy. So, I will say to myself (obviously I have this problem talking to myself) for this minute I am ok. I have a roof over my head and a bed to sleep in etc. We are not promised tomorrow, tomorrow will take care of itself. Then I remind myself that worrying myself sick will only limit my ability to handle whatever problems I do have and that will make things worse. Plus, you can't think creatively and be a problem solver when you are so caught up in the "what if's" Try to relax. about 90% of what we worry about NEVER happens!

It really works.|`|tvdKaBDoaa	So do I but here are some things I myself are working on..<br>  Take a time out<br>  <br>  Use a daily time-out to manage your stress with a moment to get in sync with your goals, feelings and concerns. Performing a chore does not fully promote the peace and relaxation needed to regenerate your body.  Whether you read, soak in the tub or take a walk, make sure that what you’re doing is not one of the items on your ‘to-do’ list. <br>  <br>  Creating calm<br>  <br>  Tranquil spaces and peaceful music create a serene environment which promotes effective stress management.  Dotting your house with potpourri, candles or oils scented with fresh and natural fragrances subtly help promote relaxation and a peaceful environment.  Create pockets of quiet time to spend in your own ‘time out’ chair during your day.  Replicate the serenity experienced at a spa by spending time  listening to a relaxation CD or table top waterfall in a lowly lit area, or indulging in an at home paraffin wax treatment on your hands or feet. <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember to breathe<br>  <br>  For centuries, many Eastern cultures have realized the benefits of practicing proper breathing techniques as an effective tool to manage stress.  According to Health and Fitness Consultant Sincere Hogan, 8 to 10 breaths a minute when you’re relaxed signifies normal, healthy breathing while 15 or more is the signal you are in stress mode.  “To achieve 10 to 15 breaths, guide your breathing by focusing on long, complete exhales and your body will notice the difference,” teaches Hogan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Meditate<br>  <br>  Practicing meditation is said to be one of the best anti-stress solutions and allowing the time to meditate and completely unwind will decrease your anxiety-driven mental chatter.  In his book Meditation for beginners, Author Jack Kornfield teaches that practicing meditation for as few as ten minutes a day offers terrific opportunity to manage your stress.  Attend a mediation seminar offered through the park district or at a local community college to garner some of the physical benefits meditating offers such as a lowered heart rate and lower blood pressure. <br>  <br>  <br>  Unplugged<br>  Take a break from everything that ‘talks’ at you.   Unplug your television, computer, phones, etc. to create a peaceful change in your stressful routine.  The change will free your mind from distractions and enable it to listen to itself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Laughter really is great medicine<br>  <br>  Those who aptly manage their stress recommend not taking life too seriously.   Infuse laughter into your life and the lives of your family as often as possible.  According to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, studies have shown laughter positively affects the immune system and increases the number and activity of T cells and natural killer cells which attack viruses, foreign cells and cancer cells. <br>  <br>  <br>  A lighthearted attitude and environment can also be beneficial to the rest of your family.   Because children often transfer the emotions and attitudes of the most prominent people in their lives onto themselves, sharing a laugh at the dinner table or while riding in the car lightens everyone’s stress load.  Patty Wooten, owner a consulting business that helps health and social service professionals develop therapeutic humor programs explains, “One gift you can give your child is to laugh with him.  If you're serious or stressed, the child picks up that that's what's expected.”|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Take Yoga and learn to manage stress for example when you feel you are stressing, tell your self mentally that you are okay, and then take 3 deep breaths and think about something relaxing. Example like a waterfall, the beach or relaxing in the park with the sun rays relaxing you.<br>  Take walks everyday in the evening to help you get the stress off and at the same time you do exercise and that will help you physically and mentally too. Good Luck, Relax and think peaceful thoughts.|`|h6dsYbkUaa	You have mental paterns that create your stress. These must be broken. Meditation and Yoga are a great place to start. Also, remove yourself from as many dramatic situations as you can.

Having a nonchalant attitude can help you, but your condition may be physical, so try exercise.  Seriously.  Exercising on a regular basis releases certain chemicals that will counteract your nervousness/stress levels.<br>  <br>  However, that may not be enough.  You may also have to see a mental health professional.  Not to scare you, but if exercise doesn't work, medication might be an option, but definitely the last option.  The source of your stress might also be psychological.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck.

And he'll probably get the point.|`|wAAhMn6Xaa	Well if you just tell him the truth, he'll probably understand.<br>  I had to tell my male P.E. teacher that i was on my period & he didn't really seem that shocked.<br>  =]|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Say "I'm on my period and I need to change my pad." At the very least you'll embarass him into letting you go.|`|AA10554882	This is a very sensitive situation, and you shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable about it for any reason.<br>  <br>  If I were you, what I would do is speak to the principal or vice principal about it - especially if one is a woman that you can speak to easier.  Let them know that you feel uncomfortable approching your male teacher about this, but that it is a problem that needs to be solved. The principal should then discuss with the teacher to grant girls a bit more time when they ask to be excused.<br>   <br>  If this doesn't work, ask one of your parents to call in to either the teacher, or one of the principles.<br>  <br>  If neither of these are an option, right an anonymous note to your teacher that is polite and that explains the situation well. <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|764Hudunaa	just say you are having girl problems and you have to go he will not argue.. if he does go talk to the principal about this he may need to be spoken to|`|wIKvnsb0aa	you could try saying it's a female thing.

KcDRAWrtaa	Yes, it sounds like you're depressed. There are three kinds of depression, your type is the "I'm just too sad to LIVE."  the others are more anxiety ridden and anger ridden.<br>  <br>  You have to be at least 5 of 8 signs/symptoms of depression to be diagnosed, majority rules. and you mostly fit that. anxiety and anger would be other BIG signs. Tell your doctor, it's easy to prescribe and no one has to know if you feel embarrassed!
xLXVSrn6aa	This sounds eerly the same as my situation. I would consider myself depressed. So yes you are depressed most likely. A big key factor of depression is feeling helpless.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I'm going through the same thing, just stick in there.|`|exMPHWKHaa	Noone can diagnose you here on the internet go see your doctor like I did. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, OCD, PTSD, and a social anxiety disorder. It sounds like you might have a mild form of depression.
j7fzuDxgaa	you remind me so much of myself. i did not cut myself or make myself sick but i did not eat for a long time and i used to take overdoes of paracetamol. theses children are bully's all of them are. i guess you cut and make your self sick as a way of blocking out the emotional pain. when i found things hard when i was young i called childline, i had counselling for 5 years lol. its not the same for everyone, but they are so so good. they help you. talk about you and how you feel and the things and people around you make you feel. all about you your feelings your situation and they will explore with you how things can change for the better build on your confidence help you to like you. im not sure if you are from england but i guess there must be something like child line if you are not in the uk. the number for childline is 0800 1111|`|cVtfxiLSaa	Were Kinda The Same...

Does your mum know the full extent of the bullying?  did you tell anyone about the abuse you suffered last year?

Yes, you are having mental health and bulimia problems, and who could blame you? People can be so cruel at times. You need proper help honey - this is far too big and complicated to cope with all this alone, and you have to talk to someone, <br>  <br>  Who do you trust most? Can you talk to them? Possibilities are: your mum, your doctor [a good start], school counsellor, social worker, teacher, vicar. Please talk to someone and ask for help - if you leave it, it's not going to go away. <br>  <br>  I feel for you in your distress; none of this is your fault, but please try to be brave and seek help to face and deal with the things that trouble you.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|HhKOOX8zaa	well, first of all, stop listening to people, they have no life if they feel that making u feel bad is funny, hang out with people that appreciate u..ur family for one and make good friends, but seriously, why cut urself??? wat will that help? by doing that u show those bullys that they're superior and they can trample u like ur some sort of meat. dont let them feel that pleasure. But u should think of all the harm youll do to ur family and people who care about u. killing yourself wont solve ur problems, itll just end them, and not in a way. do this for u, if youve been tormented, u atleast owe it to urself to do something that makes u happy and that makes u feel good about yourself.,|`|OqGQ7WkBaa	dont talk to a family counselor or a therapist, you need to go to a psychiatrist.(from experience) and please, for the sake of yourself; dont cut yourself anymore. Try to punch things or kick things to get it out. cutting really dangerous and in the future you are going to loathe the scars that you have created. ummm i know how hard life is hun and yea ive tried killing myself too, life fuccing sucks but dont end it because you never know what's around the corner in store for you. and in the mean time read the book that i am going to suggest to you. please. there are maricles that come out of reading and living by the words in the book. i garentee that you will find a change in your life for the better if you read this. i have. and no matter how stupid and impossible it sounds, IT ACTUALLY IS TRUE and if it isnt then you are not following what it says to do....

Trust me I was abused for 10 years. You are reacting to what has happened and it is understandable but do see someone sweetheart. See a doctor/psychiatrist/therapist or talk to someone you trust|`|QITDf0IEaa	yes that is bulimia. go and see your GP asap or tell an adult that you know and trust about everything that has been happening. don't ignore it and think it will go away, it won't unless you get help.<br>  good luck.

From the age of 23-25 he grew 5 inches! From the looks of your avatar I assume you are a girl, and I bet you don't grow anymore than 1/2". My friend was 5'7 or 5'8 in 8th grade and she never grew anymore.|`|OPPsfGW8aa	u may grow a little more but not any more than 2 inches<br>  <br>  unless you havent hit puberty<br>  <br>  then im not sure how much you will grow.|`|ich16U7baa	I'd say there is a very good chance.|`|lmKwo7Kjaa	girls stop growing about 20-24 years old so u might be around 5"11,  or 6"1|`|nvc2QTuQaa	to be honest i think you will grow only a little bit more.<br>  all the girls used to be taller than me when i was younger but now that im 16, theyre all shorter than me. they all stopped growing, cause i know i grew, but not really that much<br>  <br>  you will probably grow to be about 5'8.. but dont worry if your a girl its better if your not too tall, because if you are you will be taller than all the guys
FVDbVcnCaa	Depending on how sensitive your skin is, shaving upward will get you a closer shave (more smooth) but it can irritate your skin the most too. There is no right or wrong way to do it, just what works best for you :)|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Well, Bubba!  Guess what?  There is no right way & no wrong way.  It's just personal preference.  Most facial hair has a mind of it's own & if you can't clip that sucker one way - you gotta go after if from another way.  Don't worry about it as long as you get the job done to your satisfaction.
K8TCXwSuaa	If you are talking about Planned Parenthood, then you can feel 100% positive about going there. They are private, confidential and for a lot of people that seek their help; free.<br>  <br>  They would be just as capable at testing you for Herpes as your family physician would. <br>  <br>  Also, don't be scared. It's better to know if you have an STD so you can inform your partners in the future.|`|sKhyRTxYaa	Clinics are just as good as a doctor office. They have actual doctors and know what they are doing. They should be able swab it and send it off for a culture or recommend other ways to diagnose your problem.
O9GB45Tmaa	Any whole wheat is good for a diet. It's high in fibre and keeps you full longer than regular breads and pastas. Stick with foods higher in fibre and lower in fat.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	its better than white pasta or noodles...but pasta is still very dense and calorie rich. whole wheat LIGHT bread would be a better suggestion. i like Pepperidge farm soft wheat bread. each slice is only 45 calories each whereas pasta has much more calories and carbs per serving. a great substitute for pasta if you must have pasta is tofu shirataki. its basically tofu pasta...its super healthy but still acts as a pasta..the texture is a little different but the health benefits overpower the difference. its super low in calories and tastes pretty yummy with sauce and meatballs..the only problem is that they are pretty hard to find. go search it up on yahoo and see where you can get it!!
88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Basically, the more activity you put your body through, the longer it will take to fight the flu.  Althought sleep is considered the best way to free your body to fight the flu bugs, no activity, just sitting up in bed and reading may be just as helpful to your body, as sleeping all day and night. Move your body around every once in a while to help with blood circulation and comfort, just don't over do it.|`|UYaWH7a0aa	Definitely take extra vitamin c and resting overall is just 'hanging out' at home. Don't worry about getting all dressed and gussied up - throw on the robe and slippers get comfy in your bed or on your couch and plan to just relax and 'veg' out for the afternoon. If you have movies to watch do it up and if you drift in/out of sleep while you're just hanging there then you know you're definitely resting! Don't exert yourself and don't be bothered by going out to do errands, etc, and certainly no exercise!|`|IeLBIACaaa	its key to drink plenty of water and fluch yourself out.  taking some theraflu if you can stomach the taste would help alot as well.  sleep is good.|`|YZ1PvyQFaa	Watch movies, lye in bed and sleep take sunshine|`|b49d8eacfd3ce574fd99671e845b3a8eaa	It means dont over do it means relax|`|f7OxVI6gaa	Deffo. You can be up and pottering around the house, just don't go outside, and make sure you wrap up warm even indoors to help your body fight the infection. Although if you've still a fever, I'd say you should stay bundled up warm in bed with a hot water bottle!|`|9963c4bd5414abc46ea860de278146ebaa	Resting means relaxing and not doing any hard work. It does not mean sleeping all the time.|`|YkseyT7zaa	relaxing not exerting yourself
7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	A medical doctor will put you on some type of drug to treat the symptom & not the source.

N3t7uv1saa	yes, the tendons have a fairly good blood supply and heal after a long while.  The tendons, however, have poor blood supply and may never heal completely.  Physical therapy for the break should help some, wearing a brace of some sort will lower, but not eliminate, another injury

(yes im being mean)<br>  <br>  If you want ur stomach to "shrink" eat in smaller quantities. (its better to eat smaller quantities of food and eat a few more meals a day than eating two or three large meals every day)<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, and make ur stomach shrink, eat plenty of vegetables and try to skip dessert (sugar=bad)<br>  <br>  WHen you dont eat for a few days, ur body goes into survival mode and... sure ur stomach shrinks and u lose a few pounds. but when you eat again, your body tends to absorb more nutrition than it really needs incase u plan to do that again. so in doing so, you actually end up gaining more weight in the process. so that would backfire on you pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  if u want to lose weight fast, try not to eat anything fatty or starchy. eat tofu or some other things rather than meat for ur protein and vegitables (raw or gently steamed) and exercise every day for about 30-45 mins a day.<br>  <br>  good luck and hope this helps<br>  <br>  as a side note, if you lose weight w/o exercising, ur skin begins to sag and that would look ugly so exercise!|`|59XDYyi0aa	I didn't even read the rest of the question.<br>  <br>  EAT.... NOW<br>  <br>  I'll tell you why: Your body is smart. It knows how to keep itself alive. When your body stops getting fed, it says oh ****, I must be starving.<br>  It starts conserving energy and buring calories even slower, trying to hold onto that precious food. And when you decide to eat again (3 days later) your body says HOORAY!!!! FOOD!!!! I'm not going to starve anymore!!!! So what does it do? It takes all of the food you just ate and turns it into an ultra thick slab of FAT, saving it for the future (just incase you "starve" again).<br>  <br>  My suggestion, stop eating doughnuts and cheetos and start eating fat-free yogurts and apples. Did you know there are foods you can eat that actually take more energy to digest, than the energy it recieves? Things like celery and carrots.<br>  <br>  Did you know that you carry a lot of water weight? The answer:<br>  Drink more water! When your body gets a constant flow of water, it can relax and stop storing it like a camel.<br>  If you want to TEMPORARILY lose some weight for the.. dance or something... go to a sauna. Sweating looses a lot of water, and uses your body's energy to cool off. BUT! you have to HYDRATE afterwards and get that water back in you after your hot date.<br>  <br>  Cool? alright, be safe.|`|AA10717577	Forget what you heard......not eating and your body goes into a <br>  "starvation mode" which means it won't burn the food off you give it....<br>  you need to fuel your body to loose the weight. See a nutrtionist near you.
vYAgIMLdaa	yep|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	As long as the female is still in the lingerie - yes.  If you are referring to a fetish of liking female lingerie for yourself - NAHHHHHH!|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Yes it is. Men are a strange breed and will find many seemingly unusual things sexually stimulating. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying to themselves, because they have weird fetishes too.|`|vlki0YmHaa	If you get all excited from just seeing it on a rack at a store or something, that's a little weird. If you see it on chicks, that's normal.|`|sCCjAKllaa	As long as it's on her, then yes. If you're gettin ideas of wearing it, that's weird.|`|FrWhdRL1aa	Yes!|`|zEy0uuAFaa	This is a natural reaction for people who are attracted to females.  The lingerie is associated with females, and with parts of females that are usually hidden.  Also it's usually hidden itself.  That makes it all the more enticing in the instances when it comes into view, either on an attractive female, or all by itself.<br>  <br>  Some men become so interested in female's underwear that they get excited by touching it or wearing it themselves.  They may start to wear it often in secret, because it helps them feel good.  This is also a natural reaction to the practice of hiding women's bodies and their underwear all the time.|`|aBCVFc3Kaa	yeah it's common. it's designed to turn u on anyways|`|AFVwmOR2aa	Thats the purpose
jK5f58vraa	Hi, i hope i can help >< <br>  <br>  my brother had appendicitis on xmas day :(<br>  <br>  he had a strange pain in the right side of his stomach, he stopped eating or could eat very little,the pain then moved into his right hip which was very painful to move but did find that sitting down or lying eased off the pain a little but he started too get a very high temperature  all through his body. and he was admitted to hospital that night. i suggest you go to your doctors or A&E(only if like above) because you might have appendicitis<br>  <br>  (Note:my brother had a burst appendix which is more serious than appendicits.)<br>  <br>  hope this helped and hope you feel better! <3 xxx<br>  <br>  Take Care x|`|wAAhMn6Xaa	This is exactly what i had yesterday.<br>  It might be an appendicitis. You better make sure you go today!<br>  But the pain in my right abdomen has gone now so i don't really know what it was.<br>  =[<br>  Good luck.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	Sounds like appendicitis. Go to the doctor.
KhTK3Sjsaa	YES!! I get this ALL the time, believe me- you are not alone, or crazy! I drive myself insane when handing in assignments because i always think they are not good enough- or i drive my professors insane by asking a million questions about assignments. Its not that I'm a perfectionist, but i think its just a lack of self-confidence. As long as you do your best, then don't feel badly. Also, (in my experience anyways) some professors just don't like to give out good marks or reward students appropriately because of their own issues, but try not to take it too personally. I know it's hard because you put a lot of effort into doing your best and when your work goes unrecognized it's not very fulfilling, but as long as you know that you did your best, then that's all that should matter. You should try to please yourself before anyone else. (I should take my own advice lol)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|g19eiYbwaa	yes I hate english, i always feel like im going to get an F on my papers but then i always end up doing well. I normally end up with a final grade of an A but I still HATE english and writing with a passion. I would rather take a million math classes then english or a Lit. class... Okay yea for ANY class i HATE writing papers. but since i write most of them in English classes i hate that class most of all. But about your paper I wouldnt worry to much about it, your always your biggest critic|`|uCtj31SNaa	yes and its ok if its not perfect let it go|`|SmFVG8eXaa	I do this all the time. It's lack of self-confidence. My papers sound like a second grader wrote them and I always hate them, but then I'll get an A.  For the longest time I thought that teachers must not realize how stupid my papers are.. Then I went to college and read other peoples papers and I actually said to myself - Wow, I guess I am a good writer.. because you couldn't begin to understand how badly some people write! So basically, don't be too hard on yourself. It's ok to expect great things, but don't beat yourself up.  I'm sure you're doing well.. and school is just one part of life. You have to enjoy the whole journey!|`|y9tMWuQjaa	I get this, yes, even if i've tried hard. Just hand it in, remember you can re-submit a failed paper and get on with life. It is the only way. Push it out of your head and remember that it is not the be-all and end-all of life.
JXw0U77aaa	Right, so, not eating until you've lost 21 pounds won't work.  First, you won't be able to maintain it; you'll end up overeating, and you'll GAIN weight.  Plus, you'll slow your metabolism to a crawl, so when you start eating normally again after losing the weight, you'll put it all back at lightspeed and gain even more.  <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is exercise and eat healthy.  You have no one to blame but yourself for eating junk food; it's not 'so hard' because it's in your house; just IGNORE it.  Don't eat it!  Develop some will power!<br>  <br>  Sports aren't the only form of exercise!  <br>  <br>  And on top of that, 133 is NOT overweight for your height.  You'll be way underweight if you lose 21 pounds.  So....yeah.|`|xfgVGqvXaa	If you aren't clinically overweight, why worry?  You may feel you look chubby, but other people probably aren't seeing you like that.  After all, the scales don't lie.<br>  <br>  Don't stop eating.  If you do, you will feel terrible, and you will make your body think there is a famine.  If your body thinks there is a famine, it will try to put on lots of fat, to improve your chances of surviving the next one.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email (pete@friendlyfrog.net) if you want to talk more.|`|mYTVka5Taa	I'm 5'4 and used to be about 140. I'm now at 125 (ish) and really all I did was stop eating a bagel a day (don't cut out all carbs, just don't over-do them) and now all the dairy I eat is low/non-fat. Turns out a lot of your daily fat comes from dairy products.<br>  <br>  Also, try doing cardio at the gym. Doing at least 30 minutes of cardio (heart rate, for me probably different for you, at at least 140 bpm) a day can really help burn the fat.|`|3WcCeOqdaa	You don't have to be a sports fanatic.  Try simple walking.  Do some squats and lunges at home - crunches, push-ups (even on your knees if the regular ones are too difficult at first).  <br>  <br>  Drink lots of water and always have water before you eat anything.  It will help curb your appetite.  It's ok to have some junk food but just be sure to eat as much healthy food throughout the day as well.|`|gb4beCZTaa	ur actually pretty skinny 4 ur height..... cause my sis is 5 foot 5 and like 180 pounds|`|lZ57oUNYaa	if you try and lose weight like that ...you will just gain it all back again|`|GZtdISjNaa	No you silly billy. If you stop eating, your body lowers your metabolism so you burn as little calories as possible. Try a vegetarian diet, and excersise on a treadmill (one foot in front of the other, fast. They even give you handles so you don't fall over)
T71cvYdkaa	I hate that feeling of not showering. I have to shower before I go out or it doesn't feel like a good day.|`|AA10638650	VERY normal. When my Dad was in the hospital I had to stay with him & I had to go 2 days without a shower & I felt so nasty & gross. If you liked the way you felt & thought it was sexy to be nasty then I would say that wasn't normal but how you felt is VERY normal !|`|Zi6AnFzFaa	its normal to have greecy hair, that greece is just from the greece from your hands and scalp, when you have a showere in gets off...<br>  I feel nasty and then i miss the feeling of my hair when i first take a shower|`|AA10925430	Very normal, if i dont wash my hair for a day it gets so greasy by the time i wake up in the morning. It feels horrible.|`|NS6YcEQoaa	Yes. Bed head is real and affects thousands every day. After hair is slept on it gets matted down and accumulates grease and dirt. Then from being rubbed all night it becomes static and will be hard to style the next day. Also body soil accumulates on the body, giving a dirty, greasy feeling. |`|NuPtOMi1aa	I hate not having clean hair. <br>  I'm guessing being at a concert all night around a lot of people would tend to make it worse.|`|foBRx21Xaa	I hate it when my hair isn't clean. If I go camping then I don't feel as bad but I really like to feel clean when I get into bed. |`|2cf99691bb36e8205d594c179df58bdeaa	disgusting & sticky|`|AA12307022	During the day your body produces oil, and dirt and dead skin cells get caught on the surface of this oil.  You usually produce more oil on your face and head, and it clogs up your pores and does not allow your skin to absorb as much oxygen (as well as making your hair feel gross :p). Especially if you are used to showering every day, the accumulation of the oil etc. on your skin often makes you feel gross.<br>  <br>  Short answer? Yes, it is normal. :)
AA11707529	You could have caught it just by passing someone who had it, or was getting over it... all they'd have to do is breath near you. Maybe a patient wandering the halls.. Or somebody who passed you at random outside. I doubt it had to do with hospital personnel. They wear gloves, masks, and use antiseptics.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, no matter HOW you got it, pneumonia can kill you.
jWKhoQwZaa	I've had the same problem.  They numb it so it doesn't hurt when they take it off.  The thing is if they don't kill the nail bed it will just grow back and you may have the same problems.  I finally had mine taken off and they just killed the nail bed on each side (I have a partial nail down the center of my toe doesn't look to bad).  As long as you follow the instructions of cleaning and taking care of it, the pain isn't that bad.  Good luck

I just hope that they screen their blood in the Dominican Republic for HIV.|`|gpTOomPvaa	It was probably an ovarian cyst rupturing and causing internal bleeding, which IS very rare, I know this because I had an ovarian cyst rupture which in and of itself can be and usually is very very painful and I myself went to the hospital, however, when I went I did not have any  blood or any other form of discharge so there was no major cause for concern, since having one once you are predisposed to have them other times so I was told to watch for bleeding and as a rule of thumb come into the ER if I experience the same form of pain again because they can cause internal bleeding ...however, they never mentioned anything about death to me so I can't offer and conference on that detail. Hope this helps.
zEy0uuAFaa	Yes, the collarbone is very close to the surface and there are no muscles that cross over the top of it.  If a man has highly developed upper body muscles, the collarbone will be less prominent because the muscle tissue builds up the nearby areas so the collarbone is in lower relief.  Fat deposits can also smooth over the prominence of the collarbone.|`|AFVwmOR2aa	Its fine dont even worry|`|gSx7dFDgaa	yes|`|8ksBt6Xraa	Oh my god! That is absolutely disgusting!

You have at least 6 more years of puberty left with growth spurts occurring along the way.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.  Everything will happen in due time - and NOT before.

After all he did die on the cross to pay for mine and your sins. If you are doubting him this much, then maybe when you have these thoughts you need to pick up your bible and read it. Also remember that these thoughts are a reflection of how you are feeling, not how Jesus feels about you. If your not sure where to start reading in the bible, I recommend you start with the Proverbs. There is 30 proverbs, today is the 26 so start with the 26th proverb.Tomorrow read the 27th proverb and so on. You could also start reading the book of Luke. The book of Luke seems to be the best for someone who doesn't know Jesus that well or is a bit confuseed about him. <br>  <br>  I will pray for you.<br>  <br>      Chris

I have a few, but they seem to go away with the lemon scrub from Origins.  Try expholiators, they work wonders on blackheads.... not wearing makeup helps also.|`|udfFt5Rlaa	Make sure you are opening your pores prior to washing or you are doing no good.  Heat up a washcloth with hot water - as hot as your hands can stand to ring out, then lay over your face, wait until it cools off, do it again and this time while it's still warm take off the cloth, wash with warm water and then rinse with COLD (to close your pores).<br>  <br>  Also I would recommend a scrub (exfoliate) at least once a week.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I exfoliate and then use a Biore pore stip, and then astringent. The pore strip really pulls the blackheads out, and the astringent gets in and clears your pores out afterwards, and also helps to close them up. I do this twice a week
rVnTnuU1aa	I think you just need portion control. Try eating smaller portions of that bad stuff and eat more healthy things with it. Try a small salad with the pizza rather than a meatball sandwich. Try diet soda rather than regular. Eat smaller meals more frequently.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	It sounds to me that you should talk to a professional about this issue.<br>  Youre having huge weight fluctuation issues and that alone is bad.<br>  <br>  By the way, please don't use the word "gay" to mean "stupid" - its insulting to some of us.|`|77U2gV5daa	I'm not sure if that is an eating disorder.  It may be and may not be.  Sometimes I wonder if I also have on because I diet for about a week and then binge for 3 days.  I would definitely talk to your dietitian about this and see if they can't help.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, why don't you try some ways to help you stop binging.  Plan your meals the day before so that you HAVE to eat that.  Go to the grocery store and only buy healthy foods so you will be wasting money if you don't eat it.  Also only allow yourself around $10 every two weeks to a month for fast food.  Don't allow yourself to go over that amount.  Get an envelope and put $10 in it.  When it's gone, it's gone, No more eating out.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|ZY2GT7edaa	well most males tend to eat a lot, but you should eat much healthier foods..or start making your own foods. you can make a healthier pizza with veggies and low fat cheese and not a lot of oil as well as thin crusts. its def. not healthy to do wt u r doing now. i get like that a lot too. but i found that the trick is to surround yourself with all healthy foods so temptation cannot get the best of you. also, busy yourself. when you are busy you can't think of food. do whatever you can, and set a time limit for yourself to eat, and chew slowly and thoroughly as well as drink a glass of water before you eat. good luck, and go easy on the grease and carbs
AA10515207	I have the same weight problem you do including the amount. You're luckier than I am, however, because you seem motivated. I have diabetes which is not helped by all this fat.<br>  <br>  Let's look @ your problems 1 @ a time. Your breakfast is the worst thing you can eat. White bread is the worst. Mayo has lots of calories as does the cheese. Substitute a pita or tortilla for the bread. Ham is salty so you might want to try chicken or turkey slices. Don't eat this everyday or you'll become bored. On other days eat an apple or a pear. It takes time to chew which makes you feel fuller faster. For lunch or as a snack eat celery & carrots, cauliflower, broccoli snap peas, etc. w/ a LITTLE dressing. For dinner have a broiled skinless, boneless chicken breast or a small steak--not a ribeye because of all the fat it has. If your Mom doesn't have a Geo. Foreman grill, get one. I found it to be a lifesaver. Don't eat white rice--all the nutrients have been bleached out. Get brown rice or wild rice. Avoid the teriyaki sauce--loaded w/ sodium. Have a salad w/ the dressing on the side about 20-30 minutes before dinner--it will take the edge off your appetite. Have some fruit or sugar free jello for dessert. If your stores carry Weight Watcher's ice cream, get some as a treat. The fudge bars are the best. I get starved between 9-10:00 & my endocrinologist told me to eat celery--no calories & it takes forever to chew. Make it easy on yourself & cut some up & store in a ziplock bag for easy access. Avoid pasta. Eat tofu if you like it. Avoid fried foods. Buy "lite" deli meats. Eat smaller portions, but trick your mind by putting the meal on a salad plate. Put your fork down after each bite. Don't read or watch TV. Avoid croutons (@ Outback a single crouton is 100 calories. Put low-cal dressing in a side bowl. Dip the tines of your fork in it before spearing the lettuce or fresh spinach.<br>  <br>  There are several exercises you can do that are extremely effective. I would suggest swimming, but if you're like me, you aren't ready to be seen in a swimsuit. Walking is the best exercise. Start off w/ what you're comfortable. Maybe get a pedometer & measure your distance & note how quickly you add more time. Jumping rope is good too--honest! You can do it in your garage or basement if you don't want anyone to see you.<br>  <br>  Don't confuse muscle w/ fat. They are too entirely different kinds of tissue as my dr. explained it to me. To tone your upper arms carry a 1-2 lb. weight w/ you. You can get them in the Sports section of Target or Wal-Mart. It could even be a can the size of Progresso soup!<br>  <br>  The other exercise that works for me is Curves. There have been a couple of mid-teens who came & showed improvement quickly. I pay $42.10/mo. I go 3 times a week--sometimes more because I enjoy it. It's self-directed in that you listen to music & are prompted every 35 sec. to go to the next station. Every other one is walking in place for cardio. It's all resistance--no weights. You come when it's convenient, do your 30 min., stretch, & leave. I lost 23 lbs. & 17" in 4 mo.--& I looked like I had lost @ least twice that amount!<br>  <br>  Stay away from diet foods. They have hidden calories & are high in carbs & sodium. I have a serious lung/heart condition & diabetes. All my doctors have told me to stay @ 1200 calories & no more than 45 carbs/day.I highly recommend The Calorie King Calorie Fat & Carbohydrate Counter.  It made me swear off fast food--no wonder I got so fat. It's only $8.99--a good investment.<br>  <br>  Sweets were the gardesr for me to give up--& still are. Sugarless gum & candies help. Brushing your teeth takes away the craving & your dentist will love you!<br>  <br>  Drink water instead of sodas--a 12-oz. can has 120 calories & about 40 carbs. Diet ginger ale satisfies my craving for carbonation. Be wary of sugar free, low sugar, & light drinks.  Read labels carefully before buying.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I know you have it in you to do it.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	u have to go to the gym an exercise. its the only way|`|k5X78IM3aa	Low fat diet...The doctor gave it to me when I was having problems with my gall bladder.  You do not have to give up all fats...just the ones that are not good for you.  It really is more of a healthy way of eating than a diet.  You will lose & not feel hungry.  I did a Google search for low fat diet & found it.  You can do that...be sure to get the one for GI problems & not Nutri-system etc.  You really do not have to spend extra money for a diet.<br>  <br>  Also, I like to eat veggie dogs & boca burgers...no fat.  With mustard & catsup & the trimmings you can't tell much different from the others.<br>  <br>  The low fat diet is, as I said, a healthy way of eating.  You will lose weight.  Just do not get discouraged.  Good luck.  Nala|`|FyI9qlxBaa	you asked a long question, so you are going to get a long answer;<br>  <br>  i used to eat like crap. the day my mom trusted my to walk to the store by myself, and i started buying donuts, and chips, and candy, and all sorts of crap food! i would sneak ice cream up into my room in the morning before my dad left for work. i always chose the worst food on the menu, and i was obsessed with greasy fried food. <br>  i look back on that now, and at 5'2" and 160 pounds i regret ever eating junk at all. just like you, i can see that i am beautiful under the fat. and i know that i have lots of muscle. <br>  i am very self conscious. and going shopping with friends is the ultimate embarrasment. try buying size XL when your friends are all searching the stores for anything XS. and my cousin is absolutely gorgeous. every guy that i know thinks shes hot, and  although i am no longer teased about my weight, it still hurts to want to look like my cousin. (we go to the same school).<br>  my dad spent years trying to teach me good eating habits, and excersising habits. and now i realize why he did that. he was overweight in highschool as well, and he lost the weight the good old fashion way, with diet and excersize. i look up to him, and i know that if i really put my mind to it, i can lose the weight too! <br>  dont be afraid to go to the gym. sure their are hot buff guys working out in there, but im willing to bet there are just as many people in their trying to do the same thing as you.<br>  i have started eating healthier and walking to school<br>  i also have the Biggest Loser Power Sculp and Cardio Max DVD's that i plan on doing<br>  i really want to lose this weight<br>  and from the sound of it so do you.<br>  you know HOW to do it<br>  so GET UP <br>  and GET  GOING ALREADY!!!!!!|`|ZY2GT7edaa	omg i have the same problem. except i'm relatively fit and run a lot as well as do cross country and track. however, i do overeat tons when i get home from school. the thing i would suggest is obviously diet and exercise. however, don't starve yourself throughout the day..this will cause you to purge in some way. do 5 small meals every day. this may seem like a lot, but not really. each little meal should consist of a mix of protein and good carbs. ex: fruit and yogurt may be a small meal. another is a sandwhich made of whole wheat LIGHT bread (pepperidge farm, i suggest), lean turkey slices, and lettuce. you could do some egg whites with whole wheat toast, and nonfat milk. also, make a schedule and keep a food diary. it'll keep you on track. plus when you start exercising, keep track of it....i would suggest start WALKING a crazy lot, then build up to jogging then running. you could start bicycling too. or swimming...all of these burn tons of calories. <br>  <br>  www.hungry-girl.com is an awesome website. it has tons of good recipes that are low cal, low fat, low carb, etc. and it has food reviews and suggestions...its awesome! they update it every wednesday, thursday, and friday. <br>  <br>  stay strong...and DON"T be tempted!<br>  <br>  good luck to you!|`|xgsZ083Yaa	if you have on demand on ur tv just do the workout videos on there.<br>  the one by jillian micheals works really well...called the 30 day shred.<br>  i already lost 30 pounds off of that. <br>  just drink A LOT of water. nothing else but water.<br>  for breakfast eat fruit and half a cup of healthy cerial...like go lean or something. <br>  have a small lunch. chicken....salad...sandwich on whole wheat bread with no mayo ....keep it healthy.<br>  dinner try to only have lean meats like fish white meat only...no red meats. grilled chicken is really good.<br>  just eat a lot of fruits and veggies. and only whole wheat..no white anything. like brown rice and whole wheat breads. <br>  workout 5-6 days a week.....theres no need to leave ur house (i never do) just do workout videos. <br>  <br>  remember, mind over  matter! you can do it. dont give up!|`|AA10717577	okay....I have worked in fitness nutrition for the past 15yrs. I've helped people, well they have helped themselves, to loose 5-150lbs. No, no diet pills or food prepared....all from the grocery store. It is the only way that really works in the long run because you learn what portions are and what the good foods are....I have people eat what they want - no, you can't overdue anything but it is a learning curve. The weight didn't come on overnight and it won't come off PERMANENTLY overnight either. Start with keeping a food journal...I have clients email me their food journals and I make alterations to it when necessary...in your case I would suggest that you divide the total calories into 6 mini meals, no meal ending after 7PM - get yourself a smaller plate and <br>  seperate it into 1/3 protein, vegetables, and a carb .....start breakfast at 7am and finish ALL meals by 7pm..giving your body all the calories in the evening makes it harder for it to burn it during the day...and may put it into a "starvation mode" - meaning it holds onto the food because it is not sure when you will put more into it.<br>  .As for the exercise, okay, a gym is not always the answer. It can be hard to take that step into it but get some sort of exercise, and WEIGHTS and a dvd......:0)...turn up the music and dance ....they help get the metabolism up and all over as a women it is good for you. Take a multi-vitamin, drink tons of water, - a pedometer is fun and you will see how many steps you are taking...aim for 10,000 a day minimum and 15,000 to see serious weight loss. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and you will see changes. You don't say how old you are, but doing it sooner than later is important. A lot of men and women I worked with had other health issues related to the extra weight they carried.....changes are possible. Go for it!|`|JzitQpZmaa	well you will have lose skin because that is a big number! you can try to get up earlier, eat a bowl of cereal with skim milk. then instead of sharing a white bread sandwich, make yourself a whole grain sandwich. Try walking to school, which would mean getting up even earlier. Also try to eat for dinner something like steamed chicken with vegetables, and to add flavor add a little teriyaki sauce, but not too much, just enough to get some flavor, and try eating it with white rice. Small portions are better, eat at least 4 times a day, but again in small potions. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Stay away from candy, fast food, and flavored drinks. Drink lots of water. <br>  <br>  For exercise, start by doing some walking in the afternoons, or maybe also walk home from school! start small, then move to the bigger things like running, or muscle resistance.

Romaine lettuce is not unhealthy, but there's not much nutritional value to them.<br>  <br>  You also may want to drink a glass of skim milk or have some other type of dairy to get some calcium in, but it's not necessary.

You have to make sure that you're doing it correctly or you can hurt yourself. Also, after the workout, you're supposed to eat a meal that contains protein. Actually, you have to eat 3 - 4 small meals, they all must contain protein so that way your muscles are fed. Take days off, say you work out today take Friday off and go again Saturday. Make sure you get 8 hours of sleep, that is strongly recommended, so that way your abdominal muscles can recover much faster. Remember, you only gain weight and build muscle in your sleep, no other way will you get the results you are looking for without sleep.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.

If they still turn their backs on you, than they're not worth it.  Find new friends that won't take you for granted.

You should avoid opening your eyes is your cornea is hurt. Opening the eye will only hurt your cornea again and make healing longer.<br>  You should have an eye patch, closing your eye. When the cornea heals the pain will be less.<br>  You should remember that the cornea is the transparent part of your eye. If the cornea is scarred you will have trouble seeing.<br>  The prescription they gave you must be something special for you. Try to take it.<br>  Get better.|`|AA10006931	Aspirin doesn't typically do much for pain relief in this sort of condition. Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Advil (ibuprofen) both work well if you take them every 4-6 hours; alternating between the two (so Tylenol now, Advil in 4 hrs, Tylenol 4 hours after that, etc) tends to provide even better pain relief than either one on its own.<br>  Pain aside, it's still going to feel gritty or like there's something in your eye. Not much you can do about that except wait a couple days for it to heal.

dpgXzMenaa	If you've ever had one at all, there's nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon ... or several... the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm and you'll know one way that will give them to you, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|yFJDkZANaa	Don't worry it doesn't mean something is wrong with you. Most of us can't achieve an orgasm through penetrative sex alone. I can't. But what i do is just have lots of foreplay with my boyfriend and he does things to me and it makes it fair.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	Well, there can be a lot of bad things, including mold, floating around in LA.  An infection can lead to low-level allergy.  The inflammation can then make infections easier.

Pl5csTjCaa	to be honest she needs a professional help, it will worsen the situation and tell the truth to her don't lie.|`|AA10925430	By what you say, the first thing that comes to mind is that she is really trying to grab attention from everybody around her, and i think its working. Making up stories is basically a waste unless you have people to listen to it right?

Although she has a good chance if she is young and aware and does something about it before it becomes too entrenched. The root of the problem is low self esteem and boredom. She feels inferior to everyone and believes people think she is boring and not interesting without her stories. You need to ignore these stories and not give her any reaction, don't buy into them or act interested. Instead when she talks about something you feel is true and perhaps boring in her eyes then react and be very interested and attentive. She will realise the stories get her nowhere with you. But she must work on her self esteem and stop seeking sympathy from others. Some inspirational books by people who have been through hardships and survived, shunning sympathy along the way may be helpful as would maybe a visit to the childrens hospital. It may help put things in perspective. Good luck.

lnXQEcQzaa	Just make sure the school is accredited so that you'll be able to take the national exam (a requirement for licensure in most states). Also, make sure that they offer a variety of classes and extra help when needed. The size of the school won't matter when looking for a job.<br>  <br>  I have had no trouble finding work, although with the current economy, I don't see as many clients. I am fortunate to work somewhere where I am paid hourly vs. commission, so I am still getting a steady paycheck. (I make $15 per hour plus tips.) I would suggest trying to get work at a doctor's office or chiropractic clinic as you'll have more steady clients that way. I am very lucky to be able to go back to school at the same time and have flexible work hours....<br>  Good luck!|`|DhZ67kgoaa	Most massage therapists start their own business.  Jobs are really low paying.  You can sometimes find a job that pays more than the $15 an hour you get as starting pay.  A good job would pay you $35-$50 an hour but there aren't many out there.  They are usually really subcontractor jobs so you really still are running your own business.<br>  <br>  You'll be able to find a job if you think you can.

v8Jw4wRPaa	When I started my periods at 13, I had completely regular bleeding until I turned 14 and a half, then a year without them. I am perfectly healthy and the doctor ended up attributing my year without periods to stress and possibly being slightly underweight, since I moved house and schools at that time. If there has been stress in your life, this could well be the reason why your periods have stopped.<br>  <br>  However, having cramps at the times when you should have your period and then not producing blood may suggest that you are having periods but the blood is being trapped inside. This could be due to a more serious condition, such as polycystic ovaries, but is usually fully treatable.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, nobody can tell you without running medical tests, and in the meantime I wouldn't stress about it. You have done the right thing in making a doctor's appointment, and you can only go from there. The added stress may only delay your periods further.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	well, it could be your weight, if you are underweight, or just very light weight, then you might not be able to have a period. also, if your on birth control, that could do it. and periods are very irregular in young ages. im 14 and my periods are all over the place and i never know when it's coming.|`|83Sgczl4aa	it could be a range of things, like others have said your weight or perhaps intense stress. however i'd visit a doctor, i'm sure they can perscribe you something to regulate them again and sort your cycle out!|`|DYBh8bo8aa	how can u wait so long u can have a seriuse ploblem|`|wIKvnsb0aa	Being overly active, such as exercising to the extremes everyday, can cause you to stunt your hormone production and your period.

Anyway I just drink lemonade or Oasis or Appletiser or sometimes squash if I'm feelin healthy.

If you live with your family, ask them if they'll do it.  We could ALL use less chlorine in our water, right?<br>  <br>  The easiest thing to do to mask bad water taste is to add just a little lemon juice to the water- a few drops of bottled lemon should do it.<br>  <br>  Try drinking fruit teas (some herbs are diuretic, so you have to be careful with herb teas) or spice teas.  Lemon tea is really good cold, so is blueberry.  Celestial Seasonings makes a tea called Bengal Spice that makes great iced tea. Just make sure you get tea that's just fruit or spice, not black or green tea with fruit.<br>  <br>  Or, you can get sugar free drink mix, like crystal lite, but the generic kind is cheaper.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, remember that chugging a pint or two of water at a time is just as good as sipping it through the day.  Grab a big glass a few times a day and just drink it.|`|e6qsrwtLaa	I had the same problem, but I realised that water is essential to being healthy.

I feel better actually because I'm just like yay I drank water. lol. But maybe you(we)  just think water is so gross because of all the sugared drinks that we've been exposed to. Water certainly is dull next to a can of Coke. lol =] Plus water has no calories (yay!) and it is the BEST thirst quencher - even better than Gatorade or other sport drinks. I guess my answer is that you tell yourself that you need to drink it and now I don't mind it as much. just keep a glass (or bottle) of it handy and eventually you won't mind the taste as much.|`|AA11848205	Drink ORGANIC fruit juices without artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup.

You just get a drink pitcher and empty two of the packets into the water and stir. Crystal light is the main one but there are usually cheaper store versions (be careful though, some are gross! Wyler's light is a good cheapie...green tea, raspberry, lime, lemonade and pink lemonade!)<br>  <br>  THIS IS THE ANSWER TO DRINKING MORE WATER. You would need a much greater level of aspartame in your system for it to have any negative effects. Forget all that crap you keep hearing about it being bad.

It kills your metabolism and it doesn't actually help lose fat, because the few things that she is eating is being immediately metabolized as fat since that is the body's emergency system of energy and since she isn't eating enough, it's telling the body to create more fat first. Therefore, when she's working out, her body is eating the muscle in order to get the energy it needs that it is not receiving from the nutrients in food. This cannibalism creates chemical by-products that are toxic to the brain and can greatly increase stress and fatigue, and lead to a condition known as ketoacidosis which can be extremely harmful to the body and lead to coma or death.<br>  Tell her the best thing for her to do is to eat small meals 4-5 times a day. But small doesn't mean just a power bar or junk food, it means an actual meal. This will help increase metabolism and allow the body to have sufficient energy throughout the day. Let her know how serious starvation diets are, and she is only doing harm to body by doing this. If she wants to stay skinny, eat more and do low level aerobics for 20-60 minutes 3-5 times a week (dancing is good). Carbs are vital and need to be readily available for energy.<br>  I hope the talk goes well, good luck

An adult female should consume around 1,200 calories a month.  In order to lose weight, you need to work off more calories than you consume each day.

You will get the urge to do it, but you will also give up. Its a normal cycle and its hard to break. Starting slowing and with realistic goals is the only I find to break the cycle. Say I started with drinking one soda a day instead of 2 or 3. Then I gradually went to no sodas. <br>  Getting of the coach to work out was a nightmare. Specially if a good show was on. I would tell myself: IF I work out, I would get a treat. Say like a small scoop of ice cream. or a couple oreos... <br>  Be real with yourself. Weight yourself so you can see results. It will keep you motivated.|`|3PiIh7Qiaa	from your description you sound like a girl with a c cup maybe bigger <br>  so you average body weight should be a about 150-160, but to lose pounds fast in your case would be an hour of exercise a day, for the exercise switch it up every day you can;<br>  run the first day <br>  aerobics the second day <br>  third day any ind of cardio<br>  forth day light lifting/squats<br>  fifth day light yoga<br>  <br>  repeat until satisfied with weight<br>  <br>  remember before any eexercise stretch good and thorough<br>  dont use alot of weights or you will ust gain muscle not lose weight<br>  <br>  along with this you have to eat healthy no fried or frozen foods<br>  eat small meals 6-8 times a day to keep your metabolism up<br>  lay off the soda|`|lj3e3rE4aa	I think anything from entemanns gets your metabolism moving and helps burn calories.

7MD91XXDaa	I end up with very painful and visible varicose veins in my leg when i'm pregnant. This is my 6th pregnancy and the pain in my right leg/knee was so extreme that I had to find some kind of solution. If you have red or hot spots on your leg then you should probably go see a doctor to rule out blood clots. If not, then you can treat varicose veins naturally. Support stocking (about $80) are supposed to help but they obviously won't cure the problem. I was fortunate to find an herb Butcher's Broom and I noticed improvement in my pain level within about an hour of taking the supplement! It has been about 2 1/2 weeks now that I have been using it and my veins are healing! The ugly spider veins and huge bulging blue veins are disappearing! I do not have ANY pain in my leg or knee unless I miss taking the herb. I purchased a product called Sanhelios Circu Caps Higher Dose. My doctor says it is safe for me during pregnancy. I have read that you need to be careful with it if your blood pressure is elevated though.
DiiMh0S3aa	I also am going for the same kind of body (toned but not ripped). The best way that I have seen and what everyone tells me is run then lift light weights but do more reps, more reps will give you the tone body you want while heavier weights will put muscle mass on you. And of course eat right make sure your carbs are whole wheat.|`|FMOFA8ckaa	jogs around your neighborhood, daily walks (you dont always have to run), sit ups (it'll give you a firm, flat, tight, and strong stomach), take a yoga class (stretches the legs muscles to increase a strong looking appearence). and when your sitting down to watch tv stretch during commercials instead of laying on the coach <br>  hope this helped. there really is no medical secret to getting fit, if you stay true to this routine and take care of your body you'll be just fine.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	Do everything you are doing and a few less carbs, and a lil more protein.|`|BCzrcwKFaa	you might want to try something like ashtanga yoga or pilates.  both of those are supposed to sculpt long, lean muscles as opposed to bulky muscles.  <br>  <br>  i can't suggest a menu because i'm not sure how many calories you're eating.  i wouldn't suggest cutting carbs as there's plenty of good foods that have carbs.  maybe cut starches?  like pasta and rice in favor of more fruits and veggies.  try switching higher nutrition veggies for not-so-good ones.  like eat sweet potatoes (backed with no added sugar) for white potatoes and anything for corn (which is very high in sugar and also quite starchy!).  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|M1u6fdZCaa	You are supposed to gain muscle at first...it burns calories much faster than fat.  You should not want to be ultra thin because Victoria's Secret models are thin, yet with a little curve to their figure.  I am about your height and weight; when I got down to 110, I looked sick, not sexy.  You want to look toned; Victoria's Secret's top models are toned, not string bean looking...that's the look I want.  Google Marisa Miller...look at how toned she is and she is VS's top model...that's the look I'm going for.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|C4lwDCkLaa	I hate to tell you this but most of those models are the same height and weight as you but they are also airbrushed to a certain extent. I think you sound very well built and there is probably nothing wrong with you but you could probably just add some crunches and leg lifts to tone if you wanted.|`|sseHOWN6aa	you should eat fruit and vegetables exercise 3 hours a day.you should swim more too that will build up leg and arm muscles|`|4HXRmTVvaa	listen. victoria's secret models have extra testosterone. gisele eats big mac's. they aren't what you consider normal...but it is possible I suppose. run long distances slowly. this will burn more calories quickly, especially in your legs. it will tone them as well. less carbs. I eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. every once and a while do a "wash out", LOTS of water and fruit. you could also try an "all raw diet" to ensure that you're not eating anything cooked in fatty oils. so, sushi (make sure it's okay to eat). I eat sushi at least 4 times a week. it's wonderful and very filling.|`|IYLlupdkaa	run. eat lightly but often (6-7x/day). stretch.
hWQcsZCLaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably situational depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is indicated). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause (endogenous depression, resulting from nutritional deficiencies, hypothyroidism, exposure to toxic chemicals, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause).<br>  <br>   Depression: I KNOW, from experience, how difficult it is, but once you drag yourself out of bed, throw on a dressing gown, and have a little time in the morning light, preferably doing easy stretching exercises, then have a shower, a cuppa, and either fish, or scrambled eggs, and possibly bacon for breakfast. <br>  <br>  These provide a lasting energy boost: no carbohydrates for 2 hrs, or extremely little; a teaspoon of sugar is OK, but Xylitol is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles) or even a LITTLE honey. Splash cold water on your face, to revive you, as needed. No daytime sleeping; only 8 - 9 hrs at night.  Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types, whereas St. John's wort is effective for most people, tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe.                <br>  <br>             It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as Sertraline (marketed in the USA as Zoloft: a commonly prescribed antidepressant) in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation.  Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area).               <br>  <br>             A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor.              <br>  <br>        (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression.             <br>  <br>        (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression.              <br>  <br>        (3.)  Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain).              <br>  <br>        (4.) Use daily, one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 2.c, 2.i, or 11, and/or yoga, Tai Chi, and/or the EFT, in sections 2.q, 2.o, and section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>   whichever works best for you.              <br>  <br>        (5.) Initially, at least, some form of counselling, preferably either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy.                 <br>  <br>         (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule, as per page R, in section 2, at ezy build.            <br>  <br>        (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (the strength varies, but the supplier should be using a standardised hypericin content, so follow the directions)  or  supplements, such as SAMe,  or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).              <br>  <br>       Also, 80% of people in the Western world have low magnesium levels, and these are known to cause depression & anxiety. Try the magnesium supplement types shown in <a href="http://www.real-depression-help.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.real-depression-help.com/</a> Some of these will be available in pharmacies, or supermarkets.              <br>  <br>        An improvement can be noticed in as little as a week, if a deficiency is the cause. Also,  iodised salt is much preferable to regular salt (one of the treatments in books on depression is iodine drops).<br>  <br>   This is a shortened version of the much more comprehensive post, which may be seen on page R, in section 2 of ezy build, above, but to gain full appreciation, it's really best to view the whole of section 2. <br>  <br>  Self esteem/confidence are addressed in section 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I.. (insert activity here)..". Section 47 refers.  On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated: there are many options; one is sure to suit you.     <br>  <br>        Practise one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you . Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".

CA 94609  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/</a> may be worth trying for this, because it approaches the building of self esteem using a different, but equally valid method.

Part of how we feel about ourselves has to do with what other people have told you, led you to believe, or you convinced yourself of, over long periods of time.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a person may even be angry with themselves and show it by becoming depressed rather than angry. With help you'll learn the good qualities about yourself, you learn more about the interests you have and gradually start doing things and adding people who will give more meaning to your life.<br>  <br>  If your depressions is due to a chemical cause you may try medication perscribed for you to help you with this. It's important. It's probably not going to help much to sit around and just tell yourself you're worth something- somehow you just won't believe it.|`|59bI85xoaa	The best way is to see what you can do for others. I mean the people who need help in some way, and cannot do anything to help themselves. You could check online, for local communities, or ask your doctor to give you information on which old people are living alone and get it organised to go there to help with housework, shopping or just give your company. Old ladies need help with washing their hair, and of course they would all enjoy a home cooked meal.<br>  <br>  This could be the start of you being worthwhile, as you would be very worthwhile to the people you help.|`|YYVGibK5aa	Perhaps you should look for stories of people who you feel are more worthless than you.....I'm sure the comparison will make you feel better.<br>  <br>  All joking aside (although honestly it's not completely a joke), being depressed sucks and I struggle with it myself.  However, I am a single mother so there's no room in my life to be depressed.  If I let my depression get to me where it starts affecting my daughters life than I always think that it would make me a very selfish person.

shcnDVHsaa	I'm not an optometrist or ophthalmologist, but I'm studying to be one, so I'll answer your questions.<br>  <br>  First, know that there are some requirements. If a person gets myopic during childhood, it will get progressively worse until the hormone, Human Growth Hormone, has stopped pumping. If you were to get your surgery before this happened, it would get worse right after. There are a few risks, such as dry eyes and difficulty seeing in the night. There are others, but these are the main ones. Keep in mind that your eyeball will remain myopic, which still leaves higher chances of retinal detachment. Prices vary, but when you get this, I recommend going to India. Their prices are cheap and they have the best eye surgeons in the world. They will cost anywhere between 2000 to 4000 dollars. I also recommend when choosing your surgeon, you find reviews, and remember that in the world of corrective eye surgery, expensive is good. You can have this surgery 2 times with today's methods, since you cannot cut your cornea that much. I will tell you about the surgeries that many people use these days.<br>  <br>  PRK<br>  <br>  PRK, or Photorefractive keratectomy, is the oldest of the methods I will inform you fo. PRK, basically involves a small ablation into the corneal stroma with an excimer laser. Then the neccesary corrections are made. The people I would recommend this for are people who want less healing then LASEK and don't like the risks of LASIK, and lower myopia like yours.<br>  LASIK<br>  <br>  LASIK, or Laser-Assisted in situ keratomileusis, is a newer method in which a flap in the cornea is made, and the corrections then made with an excimer laser. I personally would NOT recommend this to you, as this is a dangerous procedure and for higher myopia then yours.<br>  <br>  LASEK<br>  <br>  LASEK, or Laser-Assisted Sub-Epithelial Keratectomy is, in my opinion your best choice. It is the same as PRK, but instead, uses a 20% alcohol solution to loosen the epilitheium. Then corrections are made. These can correct everything from your myopia to much more severe myopia. I really hope you get LASEK, and if you are not eligible for whatever reason, get LASIK.
sXidfK5vaa	Could be hormonal, but I would get to a Dr. as soon as possible.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Likely to be hormonal. But see a doctor, it will certainly put your mind to rest.

v8NfPGUKaa	Logically when the sun shines, plants and grass bloom. therefore sending off ragweed and pollen. BUT YES YOU ALSO CAN BE ALLERGIC TO THE SUN,  While on a med I became allergic to the suns UV rays, broke out in hives, itched something fierce and became severly congested. It is extremely rare.  I would go with the blooming and growing grass etc.  PS I have a dog who is allergic to spring grass only, being the grass that firsts starts growing when winter is over. Once that grass is cut, she is fine. Weird huh?|`|7sMwCCxwaa	It is actually possible to be allergic to the sun. My step brother's mom is. She can still go outside but she can't be outside all day and she has to wear clothes that cover her. Like she can't wear shorts and a tank top.

fMilDRgLaa	In the US you must be 18 to be considered as living donor.

TpxtE1v0aa	Okay, this is just my opinion.  I am a mother of three and currently 27 weeks pregnant with foruth and maybe twins!  <br>  After you give birth, if you had a vaginal birth, your period will last extremely longer that you are used to for up to 6 or 7 months afterwoords.  If you started birth control on the same day that you had unprotected sex, there is a slight chance that you could have gotten pregnant again because number 1 you just had a baby, number 2 you just started the birth control the same day, it is not the morning after pill, it still has to have time to go through your system.  You will be able to tell for sure up to 5 days before your first missed period if you take an over the counter pregnancy test, and you can tell sooner if you go to the doctor and get a blood test.  Your hormone levels will be out of wack but they are anyway because your body is trying to get back to normal from having a baby.  Good luck|`|X43htXqEaa	First of all, I think I would be talking to my doctor about how long these periods are lasting.  They seem long to me.  Secondly, I think more than likely your period finally ended.  As for how quickly you can tell, I believe some of the tests can provide pretty early results nowadays.  Go to Walgreens and read the box on a pregnancy test for the instructions, etc.<br>  <br>  I've never given birth so maybe it is normal to have longer periods thereafter, but I still might be talking to my dr. about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you are okay.|`|atJOyPlwaa	not sure...the pill is kinda dodgy i think really. if youre not pregnant get the injection or the bar to be sure. i had my period for seven days and on the 7th day i had unprotected sex and got pregnant. (and i was 15...aaarrgh)saying that i didnt have the pill in my system.<br>  go to your gp if its within 48hours and get the morning after pill!!! good luck!|`|WpGROxH8aa	You'd have to take a pregnancy test to see if you're pregnant. <br>  But your period shouldn't last more than 9 days.

However it's also very possible that you just finally managed to bleed yourself out (13 days is a really long time! Have you talked to your doc about the extended periods?) You won't be able to tell until whenever your next period should be and you can take a test.|`|wIKvnsb0aa	Just because ur period is gone doesn't mean ur pregnant. But the birth control didn't have enough time to get into your system. There is a possibility. You'll find out next month.|`|ACpZ02opaa	i do think u might be pregnant and if you cant tell by your next missed cycles then go ask the doctors..... how old are u anyway|`|T0r5hofiaa	You will be able to tell in about 2-3 weeks.

eQCsKq4jaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  You are indeed suffering from diazepam withdrawal. <br>  <br>  I must first tell you that you NEED to get medical help. Not to sound too alarmist. <br>  <br>  Benzo withdrawal can (rarely) be fatal. It can cause gran mal seizures, status epilepticus, paresthesia (that tingling you are feeling), psychosis and dozens of other problems. Benzo withdrawal is typically considered to be the worst and most life threatening withdrawal. <br>  <br>  You need to be withdrawn by a medical doctor.<br>  <br>  Normally people reduce the dose over weeks or months or would transfer to a different drug (Librium would be the best) and gradually withdraw. And only pills should be used for detox (no liquid) Or there is rapid detox using Phenobarbital (can be very difficult for some). <br>  <br>  Valium basically reduces the amount of "talk" in your brain by reducing the number of nerve firings. And your body has become accustomed to the extra chemical noise control and has reduced the amount of natural tranquilizer it produces. So your brain has gone from very quiet to now screaming at you. <br>  <br>  Valium has a very long half life (20-50hrs). That is why it has taken several weeks for withdrawal to start. And why even a weekly dose can cause withdrawal.<br>  <br>  Long half-life drugs typically have a withdrawal period of 14 days. And after that most people will be OK. But for a substantial many, a protracted withdrawal will occur. If this occurs, you might have symptoms for months as your brain becomes accustom to the lack of drug.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can get better and feel fine but a slow withdrawal managed by a doctor will make things better now and in the future. <br>  <br>  If you are an actual addict then cold turkey is almost certain to make you use again.<br>  <br>  If you are simply a patient prescribed Valium for a legitimate medical reason and have become physically dependent (more than 50% of people do) then you are simply torturing your self. <br>  <br>  See your doctor or go to an Emergency Room (FYI benzo withdrawal is considered a medical emergency). And I hate to tell you, but if you just started to have withdrawal symptoms they will get worse before they get better. <br>  <br>  Sorry to say all of this. It is a bit alarmist but all true.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. If you have any questions feel free to ask me.<br>  <br>  Sorry for my terrible spelling|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Can you see a doctor and get on some kind of anti-depressant? Why did you go off the Valium? Yes, I think the worse symptoms will go away but going off something cold turkey is never good and if you are having problems with anxiety and depression you need to get some kind of help. I have been through this before and its rough, I am back on the meds. that work for me and feeling much better. Eating a good diet and exercise help too, but I really encourage you to seek professional help. I feel so bad, I really do know how this feels. Take care, hang in there.|`|Sh1tgDHgaa	it will go away,<br>  its just like smoking you get addicted and you quit without and help you body will go trough things and it will feel horrible.<br>  go to the gym and drink lots of water and eat lots of fruits and vegetables <br>  ..get you body to be healthy!
r2MHR06Naa	Yes there are parents out there who have kids that have autism.  But there is also a growing amount of people using "autism" as an excuse for their kids being a brat.  Doctors and schools are to blame, the doctors label a kid as PPD-NOS (which is not a real diagnosis of anything) to shut up a parent who reads crap online about vaccines causing autism and such.  and then that parent runs around saying ohh my kid has autism.  And schools encourage the label so they get more money for special education.   <br>  <br>  Also autism is not reversable by removing toxins.  If a toxin is causing a symptom of autism, which toxins some do, it is a poisoning of that toxin that is the condition, not autism.  Autism is a result of the way the brain forms.  You can only do so much to change the brain.  Infants and toddlers brains are more plastic than adults so intervention with special education techniques can be helpful improving symptoms but not as likely to "cure" autism.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	"misbehaving kid in subway" that tells me a lot.  You have no knowledge whatsoever about autism.  It doesn't pardon misbehavior, I'll give you that, but it does explain it.  Autism is characterized by...well, I don't have to tell you but I think you ought to find out.  This is an article on autism.<br>  <br>  Autism Spectrum Disorders Most people will think of a silent, stony-faced child who sits in a corner, rocking and is completely unresponsive. This is the sad truth for a minute portion of the Autistic population, but most are nowhere nearly so severe. The most important thing you can learn about Autism is that it's a SPECTRUM DISORDER. That means it's like the difference between black and white--white being a normal person, and black being a very severely autistic person. There are many, many, many shades of gray in between the black and the white. I am in the pale gray. I have Asperger's Syndrome. The whole set of symptoms portrayed by people with ASD's (in any range of severity) are: Fixation: this means that they are basically prone to obsession, eg, they become obsessed easily, and tend to stay with that obsession for a long time. Usually a positive one, although that doesn't mean their family and friends won't go crazy from hearing them talk about it ALL THE TIME. This is called perseveration. Delayed Social Skills: they display difficulty fitting into a social structure; they often have trouble in conversation, and may talk about a narrow range of things. likely their perseveration is a favorite subject. Poor Language or even non-existent language: this means they may not speak at all, or are nonverbal. Most, however, do speak, at least a little. All three criterion must be met for a patient to be diagnosed with Autism. Those who fall in two of the categories will likely be classified as having Asperger's Syndrome.   Fits that a severely autistic child may have are caused by extreme frustration they have that they cannot convey what they are thinking.  Complete lack of the ability to communicate frustrates them so much that they do what they know will convey something--they scream and pretty much have a fit. <br>  ..........<br>  Does that clarify a little?  Autism doesn't pardon misbehavior, but it explains why the kid is misbehaving--he can't communicate with people, so chances are when his parents told him no, he had no idea what they meant.  So he kept on doing it.  It doesn't mean he is excused from his misbehaving, it only means he can't understand why it isn't socially unacceptable.  Because to him, socialization doesn't exist.  So he has no idea at all why what he is doing is wrong.  It's the way his brain works.  Sorry parenting DOES NOT CAUSE AUTISM.  sorry parenting is just sorry parenting which results in poorly educated, superficial people who ruin their own lives by doing drugs and conning people.  That's bad parenting.  Sound anything at all like autism to you?  If you are so thick headed that you don't get it yet, I am just going to give up trying to make you understand.<br>  Goodbye.|`|8ryoShBpaa	I wish you could volunteer at a place with such children because you really have to see it first hand and try to discipline them yourself before you realize that there is no disciplining them.  You can try, but when a parent of a child with autism gets them to mind, they are saying a silent prayer of thanks, because it's not that often.  My children no longer have autism.  And let me tell you, everyone who was not a professional, also said they needed more spankings, etc.  It does look like brat behavior.  But, when you give them treatment for pathogens and toxins, and their brat behavior disappears without any discipline, it is quite clear it was because their minds and bodies were very dysfunctional.  I know it's difficult to understand, but realize these parents don't get sleep, and have no rest.  They are constantly praying their child does not fit because those with autism fit over everyting that is new and different.  And all discipline makes them fit louder and longer.  They can not tolerate change due to anxiety and poor concentration.  <br>  <br>  I wish it were over-diagnosed.  I used to think it was myself. After much research, I am saddened to tell you that the problem is much worse than even what it appears to be.

jqa5igfoaa	The "stuff" includes balance games, yoga, strength training and aerobics. The balance games are fun and have made a bit of an impact- my center of balance as calculated by the game has improved. The yoga is enjoyable and challenging but probably not as effective as a real instructor. The strength training is straightforward. The aerobics are so-so and not very challenging but fun. It also can give you balance and Body Mass Index tests. I am an athlete and like to use it just to stay moving instead of hanging out, but it is no substitute for actual activity. But I'd recommend it.|`|7obOHEgTaa	it comes with a balanceboard. it doesnt ?ake you sweat but it sure makes your muscles work. you can run, but only on your place. no movin. but it has fun balance games. you should try it. it also makes body tests for you , shows your bmi and weight (not heigh, you have to tell it) and makes balance tests to show you your wii fit age, but wii fit ages arent that relible. a little.|`|cttRd8Yqaa	it's great, i have one and use it 3 times a week. you get the wii fit disc and board with the package. i've lost 12 pounds in the last 4 weeks. i started at 16 stone. i have also given up junk food so that might go towards the result but i have much more stamina after using wii fit. i would recommend it.|`|9KFfjun8aa	Ya it is really good.

sOUvTcWRaa	I used to always get that same feeling. You have an ear infection. This happens when water goes in your ear and sits. You should go to the doctor and let them examine it or go to the store and buy over the counter ear drops, Tylenol also helps. Don't take showers, take baths and try not to get water in your ear. You should also rest and sleep to where the ear that hurts is facing down, this might help it drain. Hope you feel better.|`|obAU1nlFaa	You need to go see an Ear/Nose/Throat doctor to clean out your ears.  It might be pretty clogged and packed down.

UCPY4AtUaa	I would go the probiotic route instead of taking antibiotics.  Antibiotics wipe out all the bacteria in your intestines (good and bad) leaving you vulnerable to another bacterial infection in your lungs.  That's why you are on the 3rd cycle of antibiotics--you keep making yourself weaker with every cycle.<br>  <br>  Probiotics acidophilus/bifidus can be taken while you're on anti-biotics, but they won't be as effective.  I would give up on the antibiotics and go probiotic.  You can buy these at most health food stores.  The best ones are refrigerated.  Oatmeal, onions, horseradish--3 things good for the lungs.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Read this info here, its citing that acute bronchitis can last 90 days:(<br>  I would watch for any changes that get worse, leading that you could of gotten a second type of infection as in walking pnuemonia or plurasy. Sorry hun, from reading theses links I know know more about my own issues from a few years ago. Take care ok, if you have someone at home, that can cup thier hand and while your sitting up straight hit/pat your back starting low and slowly moving up your back is a tecnique to loosen and bring up mucous, its more used for another illness that the name escapes me now, but since learning about it I have had it done to me and I used with my kids, 5 mins of this every day seems to bring some relief. I hope your feeling better really soon, rest when not at school or work, and the less you talk to less out of breathe you will get, I always found that talking was very hard on me when I was down with broncitis.|`|Gd6CsEAbaa	How did they diagnose the bronchitis ... are you sure you have bronchitis?  <br>  <br>  Was the doctor able to take a culture and sensitivity (Q tip swab) ... this is ideal, because the sensitivity part of the test tells the doctor which antibiotic is effective in killing the bacteria. This is the best way to make sure you are on the RIGHT medication.  <br>  <br>  The likely reasons you are not getting better are <br>  <br>  you do not have infection (virus instead that needs to run its course)<br>  you are on the wrong medication.<br>  you stopped taking the medication too soon.<br>  <br>  I would think that your fevers should be going away faster than they are.  You should go back to your doctor (i know ... again) to make sure they are treating your symptoms properly.<br>  <br>  taking the wrong antibiotics or taking antibiotics when you do not have an infection only serves to weaken your immune system.  <br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT MEDICATION.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope this helps,<br>  <br>  C|`|eMRNVP5Qaa	Bronchitis is most commonly a viral infection, therefore antibiotics DO NOT help, at all! <br>  <br>  Did your physician prescribe you antibiotics? You should not have to take more than one full term of antibiotics, even for a bacterial infection. You should definitely not have to go through three full terms! It is detrimental to your health in the long run to take antibiotics when they are not needed.<br>  <br>  Tylenol, Aspirin, Ibuprofen will help with the fever and pains.<br>  Drink LOTS of water -- it will help with your cough.<br>  <br>  In terms of medical care, I would return to your doctor or go to a new one (!) and ask for medications that will help with a viral bronchial infection (aka, no more antibiotics!). They can prescribe you heavy-duty cough suppressants which will cut down on the increased irritation of the lungs and bronchial tubes due to constant coughing.<br>  <br>  With proper medications, Bronchitis can go away in 7 days or less. I would suggest taking the proper procedures I described above in order to improve your health now and also to avoid problems in the future (due to unnecessary antibiotics, drawn-out illness, etc.)<br>  <br>  Good luck! Bronchitis can last for weeks!|`|AITKiXwUaa	I get it all the time, and eventually they prescribed me an inhaler.  And then a spacer with it, because I wasn't doing it right, haha.  But anyways, the inhaler helped a lot.  The fever shouldn't be lasting that long though, you might want to get your immune system checked out.  And it could also be you developing an immunity to those antibiotics, which can happen when you use them too often.|`|J8XL3u7aaa	have u ever been tested for mrsa but no go back to the doc and tell them that
AA10620596	I had a cyst in a very similar spot, so I am wondering if that is what you are feeling. Is there any pain at the site, or is it just a bump? I had mine removed because it was getting annoying and I was having another surgery, so they just took care of it at the same time. It was benign, and just something that I had. I also had one on the roof of my mouth. If it is not bothersome, I am guessing you have just a cyst. If it is changing in size, shape, or if it is causing pain, I would have the doctor check it out sooner rather than later, though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Squats too will help the quads (thigh muscles).

Mood swings, not necessarily going off on everyone, but possibly random depression, sadness or anger.<br>  3. Cravings for comfort food more than usual (ice cream, chocolate, etc.).<br>  4. Sometimes headaches like to tag along with these other symptoms, along with weakness in your thighs.<br>  5. Your breasts will most likely hurt, or at least be sensitive at some point, same with pubic hair.<br>  6. Random tiredness, fatigue or weakness is quite common too.<br>  7. Bloatedness.<br>  8. White/clear sticky discharge on your underwear.<br>  Midol will help with most of these problems, along with warm baths, heating pads, hot water bottles, exercise, and gentle massages.|`|fvPoiaAXaa	that means you're wayy under aged to be sexually active.<br>  idk i would be worried.<br>  but, its your body whatev.|`|xiFNmvOvaa	If you just started (like you frist time ever) its pretty normal. I had that problem too. It would like come 2 months later. You will probably get back to date after a few.  Either way its normal. Just a little off track. One of those times|`|3ln32Aefaa	if ur at the beginning (if u just started getting it) its normal for the first 1-2 years to skip a few sometimes. but still ask your mom. gl.|`|7MF51EJ4aa	It's normal at your age. Don't worry|`|8jTIWezvaa	No, u shouldn't be worried b'cuz it happens, Its just adjusting. I went through it when i recently started my period, it would only come every other month but when i went to the doctor she told me not to worry that it was just adjusting. Sometimes it happens b'cuz u're stressed so if u are just calm down.  After a while if it doesn't come everyday u should visit ur doctor just to get a check up.|`|zN42Q9vIaa	I would go to a clinic to be checked. Maybe it's just stress.|`|7CtrfI2kaa	depends how old you are and if your on birth control or are you on a steady cycle... stress or change in diet can also mess things up. wait it out and if you miss 2  go to the doctor.|`|8BJPvbQlaa	i dont have my period buttt, did you just start? or make sure you remember back?, did you go to a party and fall out or is there someone at home you dont trust, you could have gotten raped. or maybe your just a tad under weight. i hope i could help without freaking you out.|`|SaYRYczGaa	Dont get stressed.<br>  When I started getting mine it was tottaly crazy.<br>  Sometimes I would get it every 2 months. <br>  Everyone is diffrent but usually your period isnt regular right away sometimes it takes awhile for it to come normally at the same time every month. I sudgest you ust relax and sooner or later it will come. Since your not sexually active.|`|TumUqLfkaa	if could just be stress. Your cylce does change sometime just wait a couple days if it doesn't come go to a doctor|`|eKYBopXTaa	How old are you? Some girls get it late in life, if your worried see a Dr.!|`|fuAW1Ax5aa	Dont worry about! Your just a late bloomer! Your day will come!|`|jZ8O59gjaa	young girls periods are always sporadic...its nothing to be worried about.  I'm 19 and still am not completely regular.  if you not sexually active, you have nothing to worry about!|`|ocmzyS7faa	There are many different things other than pregnancy that can cause a delayed period. Stress and a change in diet could also be the culprit. If you're not comfortable talking about it with your mom, is there an older relative or older friend that you can talk to about it? Your best bet would be to get it checked out at the doctor. It's probably nothing big but it should still be taken care of.|`|uE7wiNWHaa	I think you should try and talk to your mom about it.I do not know if something is wrong but if something is then you would regret not talking to her.|`|wxJbWSYnaa	many women have irregular periods. if you arent sexually active, you have NOTHING to worry about. the first few years of starting your menstration cycle can be irregular...dont worry dont worry dont worry!|`|zSvZsY6Maa	It's not uncommon to have an irregular period when you just begin to have it, especially if you are athletic. It's a good idea to keep a log of when you have it. Some women's bodies do not regulate themselves and birth control will help regulate it. If you don't get it for a few months and don't feel comfortable talking to your mom go talk to a dr.
Zx7fmP3Daa	Right, well if you're feeling better already it is probably just the winter vomiting bug, as you say.<br>  <br>  That amount of water should be OK, but it really does vary between people, and the virulence of that particular bug. If you're keeping it down, carry on like that; I wouldn't eat anything until tomorrow - or when you feel better. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you're well very soon.|`|S8UFA5Mjaa	When you have stomach or intestinal flu, the lining of the GI tract is inflammed and cannot do what it is designed to do--ie--digest food and absorb water.  This is why everything comes back up or you have watery diarrhea.  The idea here is to let those tissues rest so it can heal.  The worst thing you can do is eat before that happens.<br>  <br>  The vomiting/diarrhea treatment plan:<br>  <br>  4 hours after your LAST episode--  clear liquids for 4 hours<br>      *try to sip on some water or have a few ice chips<br>      *Pedialyte is a good choice<br>      *weak tea--no milk<br>      *clear canned low salt broth (not bullion)<br>      *nothing carbonated or sweet<br>  <br>  If you tolerate that and do not have an episode for 4 more hours, move on to the following for 4 hours<br>      *dry toast<br>      *very ripe mashed banana<br>      *saltine crackers<br>      *jello<br>  <br>  If this stays down, try Cream of Wheat, soft eggs, custard, pudding----anything that is rather liquid.  This is a 4 hour segment also.<br>  <br>  From there, just take it easy and eat small amounts.  If you should have another "episode," start over.  Again, the best thing you can do is let your digestive system rest---nothing by mouth!<br>  <br>  A healthy adult will not become dehydrated in a day or two.  You have plenty of water in reserve.  However, if you have a high fever or still can't keep anything down after 2 days, have someone take you to the hospital so you can be rehydrated via IV fluids.|`|234e97b394a4df734de2011bac1d758caa	Wow I'm so sorry! I feel sick too and it's not fun. :( Crackers usually help. They absorb a lot of extra acid/liquid in your stomach (as soon as you think your stomach can handle more solid food), and drinking water like you have been is GREAT, so you don't get dehydrated! Keep that in mind because if you get dehydrated you'll feel worse. just keep up what you have been doing, and I really hope you feel better! :)|`|HmX06zdfaa	Best thing to do is nibble on crackers and continue sipping on water as you have been.Don't move around alot as it will upset your stomach more.Hope you get better
234e97b394a4df734de2011bac1d758caa	I agree with the person above me.. Go have that done. Better to be safe than sorry! :) I'm sure it'll be okay though, don't worry.<br>  Good luck! I hope the pain goes away soon..|`|7qexjhdHaa	May be a heart problem!<br>  Some times ECG becomes clear but you should go for angiography then you will be at the root of he problem
234e97b394a4df734de2011bac1d758caa	Hey! I understand COMPLETELY, the reason I found your question is cuz I'm looking for info myself because I was around some lady at work that said she had a stomach virus. Well, did you have any direct contact with the girl? did you drink out of her cup or eat off of her plate? Or were you anywhere close to her vomit? Or did you touch her hands and not wash your hands afterwards? Supposedly those are the only ways you can catch it, and supposedly it's not airborne (REALLY hope it isn't, haha).<br>  I'm pretty sure you won't get it. Don't worry. And usually if you have a stomach virus you will throw up automatically, you don't have to make yourself throw up.. So maybe she was just stressed out and felt sick? Or maybe she was worrying herself sick? (happens to me, like right now). And if she did catch it, it takes a couple days to develop the different symptoms. Oh, also, did she have diarrhea? Usually people have that when they have a stomach virus.<br>  I wouldn't worry if I were you. :) Just always wash your hands plenty of times each day, and you'll be pretty much protected. Oh, and if somebody vomits, RUN AWAY!!!<br>  haha<br>  Good luck :) Hope your friend feels better!
khe7UuhQaa	Dear Tummy Tantrum, <br>  It sounds like to me that you have bitten by a tic fly. all you syntoms point to that conclusion. Have you been near any woods in the last week. If you find a bite, and a red circle , like a donut, around it, you got a tic bite. Call for Dr. immediatily, and he will give you something to take. This will last for about 2 weeks, after the medicine, BUT you must get too you Dr....OR YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE!!!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I don't mean to be an alarmist, but you need professional, medical evaluation. Insist that a stool culture be done. <br>  It could be a benign intestinal "bug", or it could be as serious as Salmonella.|`|EStHQ30Gaa	This looks to be infective diarrhoea. Get your stool tested. If Amoeba positive in stools, that should be treated. Take a lot of ORS. It restores the electrolytes or salts lost in stools.<br>  Take ispaghula husk in yogurt. It is very good for stomach problems. It absorbs the toxin liberated by bacteria.|`|234e97b394a4df734de2011bac1d758caa	Oh no, I'm so sorry you don't feel well and I hope you feel better soon. Ask your doctor to check your gallbladder, because I have gallstones (I'm getting the whole gallbladder removed) and those are the symptoms I have, and sometimes it lasts for days.<br>  <br>  Good luck and feel better soon!|`|6CYcH8uEaa	those are the first signs of death! just kidding                             i think you really need to go the hospital!!!!!!!!!!!!! they will tell you  what is causing all of that        please go!!!
AA11303646	hi. sounds like it could be a couple of things. the most likely is that you're pregnant. if you know that's not what it is, then i wonder if you're overweight... i am and have been told by my ob/gyn that it can cause weird things to happen with your monthly cycle. also, how old are you? could it be menopause? i would contact your ob/gyn first thing tomorrow and try to get in to see what's going on. there's no point in you continuing to suffer and be frightened. let the professionals take care of it! that's why they're here!|`|cxj3FjKPaa	I don't get my period every month also. What my doctor said is that I just don't ovulate so it builds up my blood pressure. i don't think you are pregnant but you should go see a doctor he may have to put you on meds. that bring your period on. good\ luck|`|TrZMEKIvaa	If you're sexually active, you need to take a pregnancy test. Either way, you need to see a doctor. This is not normal and requires medical attention.|`|FFrXGuxMaa	See your doctor if you don't feel better soon. If you had unprotected sex, you may be pregnant, if you didn't, then it could be some other health problem.|`|QVpYwhd8aa	i would go to the doctor as soon as possible  ur prolly pregnant but if you haven't been sexually active then i am sorry i cant help...don't be afraid to visit the doc.|`|TRioMXpmaa	Doctor!|`|PhNbDHohaa	congrats! sounds like your expecting!|`|e313tCP7aa	u could be preganant! <br>  congrats!|`|4HHTDmm5aa	u might be prego!!!!! congratz !!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|k9gp11PMaa	You are pregnant, go see a doctor!|`|d1d2e8f3c2203e89e2ab460c494b8dc0aa	Have you had intercourse?

bKe04cPKaa	Man, My son is only 4 and when he was only one I was very very tempted to randomly throw ciggarettes at him while shouting "BOO". In hopes of traumatizing him so he'd never grow up and smoke...<br>  :)<br>  Don't know how old your son is but good luck..I'm already dreading the teenage years...<br>  <br>  If you ask me I think parent's role should be much larger than society in teaching your children the importance of not smoking but I know there are outside resources to help you with some good ideas...Here's some links I have found. Good Luck! Hope this helps. :)|`|2AQtMr4paa	Tell him the risks of smoking and he could die or have a life threatening illness, It makes your breath stink, and you teeth will fall out and it makes your clothes and your hair smell and no girls will want to kiss him..... and it turns your teeth yellow|`|COBBcAfraa	you cant choose for your own son. he has his own life decisions he has to make on his own. just talk to him and tell him about it, help him to understand the consequences. good luck! <<3|`|yFG0NhD4aa	threaten to beat him!<br>  <br>  seriously, find proof of what smoking can do to you.  I know kids get sick of hearing all that crap.<br>  Show him how expensive it is...and then ask, if you want to smoke, where are you going to get the money to spend $3 a day on it?  Not from me, so, will you WORK for it?  You want to literally burn up all that hard work up in smoke?  Or, would you resort to stealing?<br>  Show him pictures of lungs, teeth, and send him somewhere where the smoke has stained walls.  Let him see someone w/ oxygen all the time.  Let him hear a hacking wheezing sick older person in the grocery store who can't walk down the isle from smoking cigarettes since they were 15.  <br>  Show him statistics of cancer/death/illnesses due to smoking and how easy it can be to start corrupting your life just from smoking one cigarette.<br>    So, after all that lecturing and preaching to him, he'll not want to be tourchered anymore, and he will never want to start smoking. ha-seriously though!<br>    It's so hard to enstill right values in our children these days when society lets them think the wrong way is the most cool way.  Then, (I tell my son this now) when you are 15 years out of school, you will realize all the "cool" stuff doesn't matter now...what's cool is the stuff you looked down on then!<br>    Good luck!|`|OfZHyuohaa	You could warn him of all the risks involved with smoking and how it can negatively impact him and perhaps cause certain females to not like because he smokes.  Also if you don't smoke there's a good chance that he won't smoke either, not a guarantee, but still sometimes it deters the child from trying it.<br>  <br>  |`|5bWhApJdaa	to be honest, you can't unless you stalk him 24/7...kids are going to do what they feel no matter what. you can be the greatest parent in the world but your child has a mind of his own...just let him know all the cons of smoking and lead by example, but thats about all you can do...GOOD LUCK!!!|`|d7tIhB77aa	lol just beat his ***. r sell him crack

Also, be sure to do warm up singing exercises prior to singing. 
iVFDDRoeaa	Vicodin, even in the small dose that you take is a very powerful drug and it has different effects on different people.  It is very likely that it will make you a little more moody.  If it gets to be too big of a problem then you should let your Doctor know.  Good luck|`|oRMEtsJwaa	it's not a normal response.

CMeelHqRaa	What the skin needs is a treatment that clears pores and kills bacteria, thus preventing hair follicles from clogging and turning into acne. This is what you should be looking for if you want to get rid of those ugly acne.<br>  <br>  Before trying any treatment, I suggest you read this informational source that listed the most effective acne treatments available:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.17acnetreatments.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.17acnetreatments.com</a><br>  <br>  P.S.

I don't know how old you are but I'm an adult and i was getting acne. I started taking probiotic supplements to help digestion and it is working for the acne too.|`|DArJZtS6aa	Answer for the second question - i know picking at yourblemishes can often irritate it and make them worse but usually when theres bacteria in there it isnt going to come out on its own when its deep I poke the deep ones with a needle where the head of it is and then pop it.. then I put byebye blemish on there. particularly at night i do these things |`|Zf4FCnseaa	i heard that in order for proactive to work you must put it on at the same time every day. <br>  im not sure if its true though :/
M0WPpXhUaa	No they are worse because sugar is a simple carb your body turns directly into fat.  In addition to this the sugar causes an insulin response that causes you to stop burning fat and storing it.  Stay away from the sugar.|`|C88VCkvnaa	Too much of anything will make you gain weight. Just don't eat tons of it. :)|`|ZY2GT7edaa	the candy is basically pure sugar. technically it should be better than fatty foods because you need glucose sugar to live. its what provides energy for you. so as long as you don't overeat the candy, it should be better for you than the fatty foods. its when you do overeat the candy when it becomes stored as fat
ZY2GT7edaa	water acts as saliva and coats the pill so that it slips down your throat, whereas with just the pill, there is nothing to help it slip down

uVmwUqhIaa	Let's visualize this for a moment. As you thread a piece of string through your piercing, and perhaps move it back and forth, irritation will certainly occur. I am not quite sure what possessed you to do this, but I am certain that you understand that only jewelry should be used in piercings. Remove the string in your piercing and replace it with the appropriate jewelry. As of right now, it does not sound like you have an infection. Infections are characterized by redness, swelling, pain, and oozing. Make sure to clean your piercing twice a day for the next two weeks so that an infection does not ensue. Use a sea salt soak or diluted Dial soap. Keep in mind to never put string in your piercing again. Irritation can and does lead to infection.|`|Z81bOxq7aa	More than likely, most earrings of any quality have a hypoallergenic posts to prevent infections. Remove anything that is not either real gold or hypoallergenic & clean with rubbing alcohol, (it will sting but thats what happens when you do silly things). Keep doing that until it is all healed up & no red at all & no pain at all & then do it for another couple days just to be safe. If it does not show signs of improvement in the next couple days, go see your Doctor as it may be spreading & you want to catch it before you run into real problems like passed on to the bloodstream! <br>  As long as you have some good quality earrings put them in after a couple days as the hole will heal up when nothing is in it & it really hurts to re do that hole. But do not put cheap junk in there! Costume jewellery is only meant to be put in healthy ears & only for short periods of time. Like a few hours at an event. They should NEVER be left in overnight, you are just asking for more trouble if you do that. <br>  If for some reason you need to put coloured string there put in small gold hoops & run the string thru the hoops not thru your ears.<br>  JTM&AB|`|hCqJMe9xaa	I think it's probably irritated because your ear isn't used to having string go through it. Try washing it out with rubbing alchohol so it doesn't get infected. And try not to do it again. Everything should be fine|`|hRqJ7Ii3aa	Take out the colored string - wash ear with soap or get a ear cleaner like when you got it pierced, clean it twice a day.. most likely it is just infected go to a doctor if it doesn't get any better

HH2rl8V7aa	If you are looking to get the most from your workouts, I would recommend looking into taking whey protein right before a workout session.  It won't boost your performance, but it will however help you break down your muscle and rebuild it to become stronger.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for something to get your adrenaline going, start your workout by sprinting and yelling at the top of your lungs.  No kidding, all those battle crys in the past had a purpose!|`|dHg78Phdaa	If you are really into that and you wanna go crazy on the weights with no limits of the law. Smoke some PCP.

tz5nwLhwaa	Be careful, methadone is some nasty stuff. My son was on it for back pain. Sometimes he would take it and it would just make him pass out. Don't ever take it when you have alcohol in your system, even if it is just Ny-Quil or something like that. Don't even mix it with codeine.|`|AA11707728	So?  Go without any drugs at all.  You might be surprised to find that "withdrawel" is only a mild, flu-like feeling of crappiness.  Yeah, it's not great but it's also something you can face.  And it does not last.  Couple of weeks and it will be gone forever.<br>  <br>  It will be a good experience for you.  If you can go one day without drugs, you can go a lifetime without drugs, if you choose to do so.

AA10605419	Personally, I don't recommend the shot. I got all 3 series in 2006 at the age of 23 and I still have sign affects to this very day. My back aches and I constantly have pelvic pain. I have friends who have similar issues. I'm not trying to tell you what to do...just my personal experience. Also, I believe that it's just a marketing tool for the drug companies because 60% of women have that high risk strands that can cause cancer. I never even heard of HPV that much until this vaccine came out. Besides, the virus lies dormant anyways. I wish I didn't get it:(|`|AA11139731	No symtoms whatsoever|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	I just finished my 3rd treatment last week and i did not get any side effects from any of my injections. But if you think you are having side effects, tell your doctor! Just becuase some of your friends are ok, doesn't mean you are... not to scare you, but you gotta look out for yourself.
CHiEKZrLaa	Before I answer, I have 2 questions...<br>  Was your diagnosis of HPV the result of a pap test?<br>  Have you ever had blood tests for HPV?  (Pretty uncommon tests.)<br>  <br>  Many people who have been exposed to the virus never actually have an outbreak of "genital warts."  So if your recent diagnosis stems from a pap smear, I'd suspect that what has happened is this:<br>  <br>  You contacted an HPV virus at any random point in the beginning stages of your relationship with your husband... the virus remained dormant in your system all this time, until it was detected by virus typing done after an "abnormal" pap smear.<br>  <br>  (The whole reason we perform pap tests is to discover changes to the cervical cells to prevent the condition developing into cervical cancer.  It's postulated that >95% of cervical cancers arise due to HPV exposure.)<br>  <br>  Certainly, the diagnosis would prompt anyone to "check in" on the relationship... but your recent diagnosis is definitely not necessarily an indicator of infidelity in the relationship.|`|a6ff9f59e8aab5e4708f774467c8272faa	Yes, it can take years for abnormal cell changes to occur.<br>  <br>  Most HPV infections are acquired early on...many times with our first sex partner.  The virus enters the cell tissue...here it can stay dormant or quite..but become reactivated years down the line...when our immune system is weakened by age, stress or other illnesses.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if sometime in your life your Pap found abnormal cell changes...most abnormal cell changes are due to HPV...it wasn't until 2003 that HPV testing became standard of care after a Pap smear found abnormal cell changes...at that time the HPV test was done only on a woman 30 and older...HPV screening now accompanies our Pap smear for the woman over 30.  HPV testing has been shown to be more sensitive...the PAP smear alone.  Sometimes a Pap smear will miss abnormal cell changes.<br>  <br>  HPV  DNA testing is done with the same sample taken of our cervix. HPV is not found in any blood test...because it found in the cell tissue of mucous membranes of the cervix...<br>  <br>  At this time there is no FDA approved HPV test that tells us what specific HPV type we carry.  This may change..they are several tests that are in clinical trials.   The HPV test screens against 13 high risk HPV types…low risk HPV types are not screened for since these types are not seen in cancers.  At this time it does not matter what high risk HPV type or types we carry…the treatments are geared to the depth or severity of the lesions found on the cervix…such as CIN 1, 2, or 3.    <br>  <br>  The hc2 High-Risk HPV DNA Test?

Human papillomavirus (HPV), a family of over 100-related viruses, are responsible for a variety of medical conditions, ranging from benign hand or foot warts to genital warts, cervical cancer and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, a potentially fatal disease in children. <br>  <br>  In an article published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in March, the research team reports that a viral replication protein known as E2 binds the circular viral DNA to cell structures called spindle fibers that are present in a cell when it divides, a process known as mitosis. In mitosis, a single cell divides in two, creating two genetically identical daughter cells. By latching onto the spindle fibers of the cell as it divides, HPV DNA also divides and replicates itself in each of the new daughter cells where it can continue to replicate and persist indefinitely. <br>  <br>  “In effect, HPV is able to mimic our own chromosomes, behaving as a sort of ‘mini-chromosome’, independently replicating and keeping pace as the cellular chromosomes replicate and the cell divides,” says Tom Broker, PhD, professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics and co-author of the paper. “This allows the virus to remain in our bodies indefinitely, with the potential of causing serious disease years, even decades, after first exposure.” <br>  <br>  Broker says that virtually all humans carry at least one type of HPV for much of their lives, usually transmitted to the external skin very early in life or to the internal mucosal lining later during sexual contact. For most people, the virus persists at low levels without causing obvious disease, and the body’s immune system keeps it in check. <br>  <br>  However, in some people, the virus can become activated and cause lesions, particularly if the infected tissue is repeatedly injured, or following periods of emotional or physical stress, during pregnancy, as a result of immunosuppressive therapy for immune disorders or organ transplantation, as a outcome of progressing HIV/AIDS, and even as a consequence of aging. <br>  <br>  “This is a major breakthrough in our quest to find ways to treat the myriad conditions associated with HPV,” says Louise Chow, PhD, professor of biochemistry and molecular gene|`|sKhyRTxYaa	The normal incubation time for HPV is 3 to 6 months since a sexual encounter. HPV is and STD it is the most common cause of cervical cancer and genital warts. This does not mean that your husband is cheating or cheated because HPV can lay dormant in your body for years sort of like herpes and surfaces now and then or not at all. He couldve been with someone many years ago and contracted it but its stayed dormant. He can still pass it to you even when its dormant like herpes. You may have lesions or you may have no symptoms at all. You need to find out what type of HPV you have, types usually are numbers. The lower numbers like 2, 4, and 6 actually cause warts on your genitals which you can spread to your mouth and anus. If your numbers are higher like 16 and 18, then your chances for cervical cancer increase. I used to work for an OB/GYN so i know some about this but nothing is better than talking to your doctor. Make sure you ask what type you have(numbers) and this should help with your treatment. There many types. I hope i helped and please please see your doctor. Read the article i found its very helpful.

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	I used to sing, in Church and in Musicals. My voice coach always told me not to sing with a cold, as I would ruin my voice. I would think that asthma or anything  else,that causes you to strain your voice, would also affect your voice.

yDJiiqcsaa	I have that situation and stopped just short of surgery because I talked to many patients and surgery "only made things different" but didn't really "fix it" (They said) . So here's my best advice. Exercises that stretch back muscles (because when in pain, muscles will pull tighter and actually increase the pain by pulling down tighter on the disc). NEVER assume that you are "fixed" and try to carry stuff like the way you did in the past.  Try an "inversion table" - (this was the best trick). It is this thing that suspends you upside down from your ankles and takes the weight off that pinched disc.   Don't do any twisting exercises and don't jog (or anything that pounds your weight on your back).  Here's a "maybe"- find a chiropractor that does "deep muscle tissue massage" (pressing GRADUALLY on the tight muscles) but none of that "jerking/snapping of the back/neck" stuff.   Also learn how to lift things safely and never forget that you are one bad lifting/pushing experience away from returning to bad pain (I helped a man push his disabled car off the road and re-injured myself for 6 months). To answer your question - YES you will be susceptible to re-injuring that same disc again (probably the disc about 2 inches above your beltline ? right ? )  Write me if I can help more.|`|uC75y83Taa	Did you have surgery?  Did they just cut out the part of the disc that was bulging out, causing sciatica? If so, you should have no further problems. Good news!  :)
DVmDWDC4aa	You need to see a doctor. No one on here can diagnose you without a thorough check up. There's many illnesses that can you affect this way, from severe anemia, through to narcolepsy. Unfortunately some people just seem to be like this without a real reason. My uncle was - he had to stop driving as he'd fall asleep at the wheel, but no one found anything wrong with him.<br>  <br>  If its severe enough, a doctor can have your sleep patterns observed and your brain waves analysed.|`|MmfMJq9Paa	Sounds like you need to be enrolled in to some  kind of Sleep study.

KH4z50Yaaa	I would have done the same thing.... I would confront him and ask him what the hell is going on. He better have a real good explanation. If this is true you should check yourself for any STD's. He probably going to say that he left the password on purpose to see if you would go into his account. If you can try to find out the dates he went on these sites and check how many times he visited. I think he is hiding things from you and you stay away for a while to really analyze the whole situation|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Dump him and get yourself tested for STIs and STDs. Good luck! :)|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	ok, breathe and calm down. confront him about it, but don't make it seem like you were snooping. tell him you accidentally signed on with his info and upon finding out you did this by accident, you saw these sites and you were wondering what is going on with him. if he's trying to cheat on you with a pre-op transexual, there has to be a reason. if he denies it, then i think it's time you let him go if he can't be honest with you about stuff like that.|`|dy9C5kYkaa	i think you should ask your bf about this......<br>  if he agrees and he doesn't have true love with you then you should leave him...|`|u7Vp848Oaa	confront him about it|`|NNwEuC8paa	bring it up to him!!!!!!!!!!

It should take away his temptations, and will make your relationship that much stronger. Every man has a really odd fantasy, but most will never admit it. I sincerely hope you try this, you seem quite dedicated to him and i wouldnt want it to end for you two. Good luck!

Maybe he left that there on purpose to see if you would snoop? Anyway I would wait to see if he's going to actually meet up with it. If he does, ditch him. If he doesn't, keep an eye on him for a while and make sure he isn't doing anything you wouldn't do.|`|Py3mMf3xaa	Well as you said, you shouldn't have looked through his e-mail.

muHctmaGaa	I think it's perfectly normal to mourn the end of a relationship, even if it was your decision and for "all the right reasons". There were elements to the other person you liked, even if the bad ultimately outweighed the good. Sometimes you just have to let it take its course. <br>  <br>  I'm glad you chose the responsible thing to do with your pregnancy, though others may disagree in the comments and blame you for it. Abortion is never an easy choice for those who make it. If you feel like more of your situational depression has to do with the abortion and not the breakup, there are secular support groups available. EDIT: If you had the abortion through a licensed medical provider, you should not have compromised your future ability to have children. The mistitled Wise One is spouting pro-life rhetoric NOT corroborated by the American Medical Association.<br>  <br>  I agree with Panda Bear. The best thing to do is to spend time with friends and family, keeping busy. Maybe this is a good time for community service, to take your mind off yourself. The less time you have to dwell, the less time you have to feel sad. Even exercise is a good way to release endorphins to feel better.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	Yes, that is completely normal. Annivarsary grief is incredibly prevelant in women that have had abortions. You risked everything for him....Possibly scarring your uterus and not being able to have children again....Not only that,,,,you murdered your own child, flesh and blood, that has 50% of your DNA.<br>  <br>  I think you should have had the baby then you could have collected child support for the next 18 years...That is your right! It's the law.....Fathers need to pay child support no matter what or they go to jail.<br>  <br>  I hate seeing cases like this when the woman terminates and just lets the guy off of the hook. You had to go through the hell of an abortion, risking your life and your reproductive organs...and he had to do nothing.|`|83Sgczl4aa	of course this is normal, i can't really judge the situation but it seems like you made the right decision so stick to it!<br>  it will take time for you to move on as when you get into a routine of seeing someone whoever it is and whatever happens you will get withdrawral so i'd just wait it out and you'll feel better, for now i'd try to keep your mind off it by going out and enjoying yourself! <br>  good luck! <br>  x|`|OeK9tsh6aa	Hi, I know how you feel im ive been in the same place as you, sorry to hear that. Just keep reminding your self why you had to do this. i think you made the right decision :) Please dont let your self get depressed, im sure you'll find that Mr.right soon and the best of luck! look after yourself. x|`|GGjjtHmHaa	well, i've never gone through and abortion, but i have experienced bad break ups and yes, you will probably feel sad and lonely just because he probably took a lot of your time or you just spent a lot of time thinking about him, and now that you are not together, you are probably thinking about him through a different perspective. you are thinking about the times you had where as before you were probably thinking about the times that you are having. and since he's not around to keep you busy, you are finding that there is more things you can do but since you are so use to being with him, it's just a very different change. once you get use to it im sure everything will be fine. go and hag out with friends or something. i would suggest keeping your mind busy.|`|atJOyPlwaa	i don't have any experience with this but if you feel you weren't ready for it then that's your decision. everything happens for a reason you know. its only natural to feel this, when you are pregnant your hormones change so obviously when you have a termination your body needs time to repair and get back to normal. it is normal and don't worry it wont last forever. you're probably just sad about the whole situation. get a well needed rest till you recover, do something to get your mind off this and when you're better a night on the town would do much good<br>  feel better petal<br>  x|`|pbRQUN9Uaa	Yeah it is normal, try to focus on your future and TRY to forget about your past even though it will be hard... try to keep your mind focused on something else and hopefully your sad and loneliness will pass, good luck in the future.x

Implementing a solid approach to each of these factors will go a long way to assuring your success.<br>  <br>  First, you must adopt a weight gain diet that increases your caloric intake and provides your body with the nutrients that will allow it to grow. <br>  Second, while bodybuilding supplements won't be the cause of your weight gain plan's success, they can add to your ability to successfully provide your body with what it needs. <br>  Third, you must weight train with schedules, methods and routines that are conducive to mass gains. <br>  Fourth, you must monitor your progress and track the methods used.

dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|XadcGNGnaa	Well you should tell your mum, what's wrong with telling her? She went through it too, at least tell her when you start your periods.<br>  <br>  The white stuff is discharge that happens before periods, it can be there for around 1-2 years before you do start menstruating. It can be really annoying so wear a panty liner to make you feel a bit more fresh. Also carry some pads and some pain relief in your bag just in case you start at school or while your out somewhere. Look out for tell-tale signs like tummy cramps, back ache, aches in the top of your legs, bloating and mood swings.

AA11522944	It is perfectly normal NOT to be able to retract your foreskin when you are a child. When you are an infant the foreskin is actually attached to the glans (head) of your penis and naturally detaches itself normally somewhere between the age of 5 and 10.  <br>  <br>  As well as being attached to the glans of the penis the foreskin of a child can also be naturally ‘tight’.  In other words not all boys have a foreskin that is loose and easily retractable even when it has detached from the glans.  It is somewhat normal therefore for the foreskin to require some stretching before it is easily retractable and an inability to retract the foreskin in children does not necessarily indicate a ‘problem’.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is stretched ‘naturally’ when the penis becomes erect or the boy himself manually retracts the foreskin to urinate, wash or masturbate.<br>  <br>  Check out the pics in the link below which shows how a foreskin retracts once detached from the glans and the foreskin is sufficiently loose.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:A_Foreskin_Retraction_Series.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:A_For...</a><br>  About 5% of males cannot retract their foreskin by the age of 17.<br>  <br>  Even when the foreskin is fully retractable there should still be a strip of skin called the 'frenulum' attached underneath... this never detaches. See the following link.  <a href="http://www.foreskin.org/frenulum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreskin.org/frenulum.htm</a><br>  <br>  If it is the frenulum that is stopping your foreskin from pulling back or it seems to be too short you could have a condition known as a ‘frenulum breve’. See these links<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Images/Glossary/frenulum-breve.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Images/Glo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.london-urology.co.uk/frenuloplasty.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.london-urology.co.uk/frenulop...</a><br>  <br>  If the foreskin is detached from the glans of your penis but is not fully retractable because the ‘hole’ in your foreskin is too small to allow the glans to come out AND the foreskin does not appear to be stretching over time you may have a condition known as ‘Phimosis’.<br>  <br>  Phimosis is not uncommon and often resolves itself through puberty as the normal practice of masturbation stretches the foreskin to the point where it retracts fully. To stretch your foreskin simply try to retract it a little more each time you shower, urinate or masturbate. Otherwise you can do stretching exercises as describe in the links below.<br>  <br>  You should NEVER force a tight foreskin back when you are erect or hold it back prior to becoming erect. Forcing or holding the foreskin back can hurt and cause injury including ‘Paraphimosis’ where the tight foreskin restricts blood flow to the glans.  <br>  <br>  If your foreskin is very tight, is not stretching or loosening over time, or still feels firmly attached to the head of your penis you should see a doctor.  A doctor can prescribe steroid creams which assist with the stretching process.<br>  <br>  In extreme cases of phimosis circumcision might be recommended but this is usually a last resort. <br>  <br>  Check out the links below<br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/Factsheet_PenisProblems.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/F...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/tight_foreskin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/ti...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathermag.com/health/boy-care/boy-care2.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathermag.com/health/boy-care...</a><br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgS_BsYpEJnIQjyQ9xkG4EPg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080704035859AA2gWX8">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Agv5irHjawO.lSGw14XGKkTg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080718012622AApCEx8">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Tell your parents, little Bubba!

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

(i know my lingo is a bit un-professional but i am just trying to help you understand). basically, something about oxygen makes you burn calories. so, when you are doing intensive cardio, your body needs to take in more oxygen, and when it does, you burn more calories. so, having that said, i would aim for some kind of activity that makes you huff and puff. the objective is not to workout until you pass out, but work at a pace that tires you enough to feel the burn, but lets you keep going. most team sports are great for this. some other ideas are jumping rope, running, bicycling, and aerobics. basically anything that speeds up your heart rate is fair game. if you would like to look up some workouts, here is a great site for that. you can search any keyword related to working out and find many articles to read. good luck!<br>  <br>  www.bodybuilding.com|`|fdelyVYJaa	Read: How to eat less to lose weight and not to be hungry <br>  from <a href="http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/01/how-to-eat-less-to-lose-weight-and-not.html" rel="nofollow">http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/0...</a>
u8CFwtyMaa	When you were younger, the foreskin was stuck to the entire surface of the glans to protect it. Usually just before the start of puberty, the foreskin will start to detach, and can be pulled back.<br>  You should clean under your foreskin every day. Do the white spots wash off? if they do, then they are only smegma, which is a build up of secretions, and dead skin. This should be washed off daily.<br>  To stretch your foreskin do the following - <br>  Do it in the bath or shower - the hot water helps to soften the skin.<br>  Insert a clean finger under the foreskin, and gently stretch it - don't do it so much that it hurts, as this can cause micro tears, that then heal with scars - not what you want.<br>  It will take several weeks before you see any results, but keep it up daily and you'll get there.<br>  Pulling the foreskin back whenever you pee will help, as will masturbating.<br>  In rare cases the skin may remain stuck to the glans - see the attached link, and if it looks like that, then you may have to see a doctor<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/Botched1sb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/Bo...</a><br>  This is more usual after circumcision, so it probably won't apply to you.<br>  Hope this helps|`|pzLDXL6gaa	When you're young you're not supposed to clean down there, foreskin and glans are attached, so don't worry.

tqoB4exxaa	I was in your exact situation, still am. You're best bet is to get some Weight Gainer formulas, specifically with Whey Protein. I've used Cytogainer and Muscletech Weight Gainers. Both worked very well, but I had my best gains with the Muscletech. The shakes aren't as bad as you might think, and especially if you have one in the morning, one before a workout, and one right before you go to sleep. You will get very used to the taste and even like it(I prefer chocolate, but to each his own). You will still need to eat, and if you're like me you do eat a lot just none of it seems to stick to your bones. The weightgainer formulas have insulin in them(which to my knowledge is perfectly healthy) and insulin helps excite the muscles to build. They have other stuff, but I don't think you want a very deep scientific answer. Basically that is the most important thing, the weight gainer stuff and try to eat as much as possible. Besides that, I used a supplement called Formadrol Extreme, and it worked pretty well, made me really pumped to work out (there is a stack that LG Sciences sells called the Trifecta Stack. Didn't work for me at all, but the Formadrol did). Also, Chicken has the most protein content per fat/calorie out of any meat.
TNTFomKeaa	My understanding is that heroin and vicodin are both derived from opium, as are many other drugs. This means that vicodin can be addictive if you take too much for too long, and it can be dangerous to drive while taking it.

55NKPb82aa	Do push ups or hand stand push up|`|26877bb95083be4fc83c191fd934faa4aa	you could do different variations of pullups, climb rope, decline pushups, different variations of dips, dancing, swimming, karate... anything along those lines. there arent many workouts to do by just using your body weight. however, there are enough to switch things up and not do the same thing over and over again. strength is built up over time. so, my advice would be to work with these exercises and  do as many repititions as you can, for about 5 sets each workout. be careful though, because after a while, your muscles get used to doing what they are doing, and they will begin to stop building strength as quickly. this is called muscle plateau. to avoid muscle plateau, keep your body guessing. all this means, is try to avoid a routine, and never do the same day's workout twice. mix up the different workouts as much as you can. also, make sure you are eating a lot of protein so that your muscles can heal up. doing this will make you stronger, it just takes time. if you would like more advice, message me. i feel like i could help you out much more if we talked 1 on 1. good luck!

It's the loss of iron.|`|bQCfOftxaa	i sometimes feel like all i wanna do is crawl up in bed and "sleep away my period". but in reality...if i get up and move around - do some chores around the house, go for a walk, go to the gym, etc. i actually feel a lot better.  but i know that this is almost "impossible" for some girls because they can hardly move when the get their period (one of my sisters is like that).<br>  but yes,  i do feel sleepy (especially when i first get it)...but i think for the most part it's mind over matter for me.|`|jnOiqcAlaa	Yes, it is. You lose a good amount of blood during your period, so your body is storing up energy to make new blood.|`|VdnAH78Xaa	idk but thats all i want to do during that time|`|yFJDkZANaa	Yeah cos your bleeding a lot and that can cause tiredness,laziness like can't be bothered to do anything.

Efe7wstZaa	Hi alexis.<br>  The real problem with panic attacks and anxiety is that it is a viscous circle. As you experience now, the fear of the panic attack will create anxiety and that anxiety can eventually lead to a panic attack.<br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.<br>  My girlfriend suffered from nightly panic attacks for a long time. She refused to take medication and instead went om some mindfulness courses. They did work to an extend. About six months ago she gotten worse and one night we were surfing the net for a solution.<br>  We found a website with a ebook and a e-course, that really helped her.<br>  <br>  She is not cured yet though, but she is going in the right direction.<br>  And she haven't had a panic attack since :)<br>  <br>  I've did some googling for you and here you go: <a href="http://tips-to-prevent-panic-attacks.com" rel="nofollow">http://tips-to-prevent-panic-attacks.com</a>

I'd go with the colour that best matches the majority of clothes in your wardrobe.  Maybe blue would be good as a wintery colour, and next go an orange or yellow for the autumn - summer time.<br>  <br>  Watch out if you eat foods with a lot of colouring in, particularly currys or similar.  They will dye the little coloured bands a yucky yellowy colour until you get them changed.|`|GBnj1lo1aa	if its possible get clear or silver braces because i found that with the coloured ones they tend to change colour when you eat certain foods.<br>  eg. blue-green-yellow<br>  <br>  it wasnt nice|`|paerqxfMaa	I don't understand anyone wanting colored braces - it just brings more attention to your mouth - I remember the days of "metalmouth" and "tin grin" - if given the chance, I would go with clear.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	I would recomend invisalign... you can barely notice them at all.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.|`|AA12032374	look for foods that are high in fat. and sugar. don't exercise to work off the calories she eats|`|f4ehvRQlaa	tell her to eat bread, pasta, etc, and drink milk.|`|ySB6dZYlaa	complex carbohydrates, like potatoes and stuff.|`|XR3SPPCVaa	have her eat alot of meat steak, hamburgers, chicken etc good luck|`|2VeQdw03aa	nnnnn|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Smear yourself with honey have her lick it off.

If still young, then she'll probably gain a little as she gets older (whether she wants to or not).   I wouldn't worry about it as long as she's healthy.

c0193f44d7d8c3dc36cdfd2185bcdb05aa	Jojoba oil is used as a moisturizer, it is great for oily skin because it doesn't add oil to it like other oils. It is easily absorbed and doesn't leave greasy residue. Lavender is used if you have an infection or inflammation as it it calms and soothes the skin.

On top of this, you've then got the people who didn't warm up properly when playing sport who've pulled muscles etc. etc.<br>  <br>  I don't get this. People who smoke also pay the taxes off their income that then get used to pay for their treatment.<br>  <br>  Similarly, since most people eat too much sugar (and food in general) then we should all have to fork out.

If it hit "straight away" it would be bad BUT it doesn't hurt immediately it takes about 3 seconds for it to REALLY register and then it hurts up  the abdomen (2-3 inches lower than the navel). And then it it would be about 8=9 for a while.   Then the "boys" would swell up for a couple days.

Are you getting enough iron (feeling weak?) I'm no nutritionist, but I do know that if you eat healthier that your energy should improve. Stop drinking pop and eating empty calories. Having too much sugar won't do you any good in this either.<br>  <br>  Green tea is great. I'd suggest 3 cups a day if you're looking for a real energy boost. One may or may not be enough depending on your sensitivity. Absolutely no energy drinks! You'll feel like crap after a while. <br>  <br>  It should be obvious but you should be getting a decent amount of sleep too. Set a regular bedtime. It will be best if you always go to bed and wake up around the same times.

E2IaiCpyaa	Anesthesia has some effects yes.  Not all people react the same to it so i wouldn't worry you will be in good hands.  The nurses are trained well in the post op room.  If you are super nervous when you get there they will give you a sedative to relax you.  You will be just fine.  Keep your strength and positive spirits high so you can get through the surgery.  Best of Luck.|`|5KdXVKrJaa	when i was 14 i had to get surgery<br>  once i woke up i didn't even know i was done i couldn't feel a thing and i ended up falling back asleep in the morning (i had my surgery around midnight) i woke up and had to pee i didn't feel as bad as i did before the surgery but i got my period it is normal to get your period after a surgery<br>  then they made me walk up and down the hallway which sucked they gave me pain pills and told me i could only take a shower no baths because the stitches needed to dissolve on there own<br>  i never really felt sick my medicine made me feel a little nausea but other then that i didn't feel sick<br>  oh i got my appendix removed lol<br>  hope i helped<br>  good luck|`|xJ0HJKlXaa	i'm sorry for you... get well soon!  anyways, some people get sick from the anesthesia, some don't. i didn't when i had knee surgery, i was absolutely terrified too. i sent my self into shock soon after they put the IV in my hand to start me on fluids. they ended up having to give me a tranquilizer, which burns all through your veins. sorry, this probably isn't helping much.... anyways, the last thing i remembered was havoing ot try to switch beds from the wheelie one to the solid one, and seeing the shiny yelllow pearly looking light and the lady saying ok, this is when we would count down if we were going to.... then i woke up and they were like, oh good, you're awake, and went to fetch my parents.  i'm sure you'll be ok, the worst part after being terrified and having to get stuck with a needle was them taking the needle out. that i passe out with.   it was pretty funny later though, cuz i said my foot on the leg i didn't have surgery on felt funny, and when we looked at it, they had stuck my sock form the other foot double on it. and i had mismatched socks too!     have fun wearing the paper shorts, lol....you'll be ok, the nurses will take really good care of you, and the prep beds have little heater things in them to keep you warm :)    get well quick!|`|h6cAhPs6aa	i have had 23 surgeries and there where very few times that i ever got sick,  but a lot of that depends on you.  i don't think you will get sick at all.  not for foot surgery.  if you where having some kind of stomach surgery or something in that area then you might, and even then you might not get sick.  you'll be fine.  just keep telling yourself you will be fine. sometime anesthesia settles your stomach,  because it relaxes you.  you will do GREAT|`|1NTiqmtxaa	it all depends on the person... i have had numerous surgeries already and the anesthesia makes me sick every Time... if it does make you sick the doctors will give you something for it... one thing that always helps me b4 i go under is to think insomniac peacefullyl or think of some person you like or someone to dream about and b4 you know it you will be done... you will hardly ever wake up with lots of pain cuz they dope you up on meds but if u need just say it... well i hope this helps and good luck on the surgery|`|00sn8G9paa	Tell them you want a spinal. I went through a hip surgery and had no problem whatsoever with that kind of anesthesia. You'll also snap out of it alot quicker after surgery. When its over, you'll wonder why you were nervous in the first place. Don't worry about it. They know what they're doing.
LixIw7bpaa	The tension from the teeth coming in, and the pain from your gums is going to cause headaches and nausea. Your doctor may feel that you still have time before you need to get them removed. However you need to tell them that they are sore. They then will pull them for you. You can take advil no more than 6 a day. take 2 in morning evening and before bed. It should help with the pain.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	If your friend is in her 30s and this is a new thing or even a long standing problem, she needs to see her GP. The main concern is that bleeding for more than 7 days each month can in theory, put her at an increased risk from iron deficiency anaemia. Her Doctor will do a blood test and if indicated she will need iron supplements.<br>  <br>  She needs to make sure she is up to date with her smear tests. Any change to menstrual bleeding frequency after teenage years should always be investigated.If there is no underlying cause and it is simply a hormonal imbalance, then the pill may be an option or progestogen Norethisterone.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	She does need investigated for her twice monthly periods. Frequently however there is no apparent cause and the only solution is to control the bleeding with hormones, usually either the combined pill or progesterone.
yT6Mezweaa	I am not trying to label you but are you one of those conspaircy theorists? If so, nothing wrong with that just wondering.. But back to the question,<br>  <br>  I agree with the first answer. Look into moving and starting fresh. I don't know what you like so you will have to do some research on cultures, jobs, and things like that. My suggestions would be, Australia, Argentina, or Japan (really really different in terms of society)<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, oh and when people treat you like "for years ive put up with aloofness from people in society , stan offish behavior, condescending behavior - people treating me as a charity case .<br>  weird intrusive looks in supermarkets - this used to happen with my rage attacks years ago, but since ive been doing well, controlling myself, getting help.."

KhTK3Sjsaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I don't think its a problem if you are truly happy! Lots of people would kill to be in that position! I think it just shows that you are an independent person who doesn't rely on others for your own happiness and that you find happiness within yourself. That is a wonderful quality, I think you seem to be a very positive person who is not dwelling on the present, and instead is looking forward to a bright future!<br>  <br>  Enjoy your happiness!! :)|`|xI4vz1eraa	Blondy, you are fine just the way you are. The hype life isn't necessarily living. Whatever and However you operate that makes your life content is being happy. We share similar lifestyles although I have a significant other but it is like I don't because we are separate most of the time. I enjoy browsing the net, keeping myself entertained and watching television. The beauty of life is enjoying it, clubs are for some not all, like me I'm 24 and have been out 3 times and I love what I do. If you are spiritual maybe God has designed your life this way to be in preparation for your "husband/ baby", to make you guys in sync.|`|AyeYeS2baa	Nothing wrong with that, people tend to view me as anti social<br>  because I LOVE staying home it beats getting into some kind of drama when you go out drinking LOL, and believe me there's ALWAY's drama when you get 300 drunk people in a room|`|NGKwsawdaa	I think that's great that you're happy. That means that you are truly happy within yourself and don't rely on others to make you feel good and better about yourself.
exMPHWKHaa	haha yes first of all Marijuana is not highly addictive at all. People have told you myths about its addiction. Its less addicting then caffeine! Ignore the ignorant responses. Prescription pills such as vicodin and oxycotin might not be as strong as heroin but things such as morphine are very addictive. Desoxyn is meth too and in prescription form and its very addicting. Valium, and Xanax are also very addictive and all the rest in its class of benzos.|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes many are more so,diazapan being one of the worst,pain killers such as codeine based ones can also lead to addiction problems,,cannabis however is not classed as addictive,|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Believe it or not, all three of the 'illegal drugs' you mentioned are also prescribed to people and can be taken legally when prescribed in most states in the US and all over the world.  Marijuana is NOT 'highly addictive' at all.  You can 'want it' but you can NOT get 'addicted' to it at all.  Heroin is 'addictive' but is now 'prescribed' for some who can't take 'methadone' for pain ... these are prescribed for many people who are 'terminal' or who have 'extreme and constant pain' and still must have a life.  Cocaine is prescribed for many eye conditions, especially glaucoma.<br>  Are other drugs as addictive.  Yes, many are addictive when they are ABUSED (not taken as prescribed with little to no 'follow up' by the doctor.  Valium is probably one of the 'worst addictions' since a person must take 'more and more' to get the same results over time.  Heath Ledger took an 'accidental overdose' ... he was NOT "addicted' to his prescriptions, but he 'lost track' of the pills he had taken when, and because he lived alone and didn't 'go out' of his apartment he died with no help.  It's sad, but such things do happen.  Why do you want to know about 'prescription pills' that are addictive in the first place.  No one should take a 'combination' of any drugs without being overseen regularly by a doctor who knows your 'full medical history' and the full list of prescription medication you are on.  That is one of the best things about having a good 'primary care' physician ... and everyone should take that list to both that doctor and to the pharmacist who gives them the prescription drugs ... and if you need to get a prescripiton filled elsewhere, you should at least call the 'main pharmacist' and tell him/her about the new prescription, the frequency and dosage amount, and that you'll be taking that drug for the amount of time ... however long.  That way even if you do become addicted, you stand a better chance of making a good recovery, and having a long and happy life.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	I have known people who have been hopelessly addicted to to prescription pills, infact there seems to be somewhat of a culture here for taking them for fun too, I've known them to destroy peoples lives and personalities along with their relationships, I've even known them to play quite a lagre part in the death of someone very close to me. People can say all they like that theyre not addictive and doctors can go on prescribing them as a remedy for things like depression and anxiety, but its wrong. They serve only as a contributing factor to what may be a simple mental problem, that could be resolved with councilling and support, instead trapping people and dragging them further into their own despair. Its sad that this is allowed to happen, I could go on and on about this. Drugs are not the answer, not for simple anxiety disorders and things of that nature anyway, its just a way to avoid spending time and money on patients who are in need and I think its wrong.|`|Emlhvl7oaa	hi - avoid anything codeine based, i don't know generic names where you may live, but in the uk, proximal, solpadine, and codeine phosphate are given out like candy by G.P 's as pain - killers etc, they are basically opiate which, i have been told makes you forget you are in pain, rather than treat the reason you are in pain, therefore you are more likely to continue everyday tasks - rather than rest the injured limb, leading to more damage - more pill-popping - result ? tolerance= addiction ! try traditional remedies or just rest, don't be tempted to find a quick fix for any pain, you are in pain for a reason, blocking that fact from your brain will not help you.|`|duVTqRM4aa	Just ask Rush Limbaugh.|`|Wf983VOnaa	There is no proof that Marijuana is anything but mentally addictive. That being said,pills containing synthetic opiates(IE Hydrocodone,Oxycodone,Morphine) can all be both physically and mentally addictive over time. Same withdrawals you get from Heroin(trust me! Am 30 days clean after many attempts over the past 5 years to get off Heroin and Oxycontin). <br>  Benzos(Valium,Ativan,Colonopin,) are also extremely addictive if misused or prescribed for long periods of time. Was never much into them,but I understand the withdrawals are pretty bad.<br>  What type of prescription pills are you talking about.|`|dHg78Phdaa	I hate when kids grow up watching TV and they see a anti-pot commercial come on and say how Marijuana is addictive and horrible. The truth is that they are lies. Nothing but. Marijuana is less addictive than caffeine and there are no documented deaths from Marijuana. Its sad how the public is miss-informed by the media and is sponsored by not drug companies, but yes, alcohol and tobacco companies have no evidence against Marijuana, but if it ever becomes legal, Tobacco and alcohol sales will nose dive. Its just a conspiracy. Look all these facts up yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, ya ignorant little girl.|`|NSLE4JImaa	"prescription pills" is not a single entity.  Some prescriptions are addictive, such as codeine or other heavy-duty painkillers (usually opiate derivatives), but others are not.  Marijuana is not highly addictive, heroin is similar in structure to many prescription pain pills, but many other prescriptions are neither addictive nor habit-forming.  Also, it's heartthrob, not heart rob.|`|IDCNOKbWaa	Funk ya they are if not worse because people think that since they have some degree of legality that they're ok to make those leathal combos god knows i have.|`|AA10341358	Oh yes! There are lots of people addicted to Prescription drugs which are liable to cause a lot more damage to their bodies than Marijuana and cocaine in one dose!|`|lPDRQH7aaa	Marijuana is not addictive.|`|4UotaSeiaa	they are not that addictive however longterm use can cause a dependency|`|hqfH47tHaa	HA! Doubt it..especially the last 2 drugs u mentioned.
uJDPFp1Raa	Marijuana is NOT addictive.<br>  Prescription pills  Heroine, and cocaine can all cause physical dependence. If a person is addicted to any of these, and can't find any they will feel physically ill. Depending on the addiction level the illness can feel like mild flu symptoms, or complete misery.|`|tq5vKKWzaa	marijuana is not addictive. prescription drugs can be, based on dependence.
87756LlTaa	Yes.  Some prescriptions are just as addictive as heroin and cocaine.  Why?  Percocet, Vicodin, Codeine, MS contin, and many others are all opiates.  They are variations on the same ingredient of heroin and cocaine.  Benzodiazepines, like xanax, klonopin, and valium activate the same receptors as alcohol.  So, yes, they are as addictive.  <br>  <br>  As for combinations.  They are necessary in many medical conditions.  They become addictive when taken too long or prescribed when not needed.  Some even become addicted when the are medically necessary.  The doctor doesn't intend for this, but it does happen.  Some people go to numerous doctors looking for these scripts because they are trying to numb themselves.   It is very sad, but there are effective and confidential treatments.|`|mYTVka5Taa	Marijuana has a low addiction potential, just so you know.<br>  <br>  It depends on the prescription drug. Opiates, for example, are very addictive. Usually pain killers are the most addictive prescription pills.|`|U2lAi90Jaa	stay away from psych drugs they will mess your life up same as illegal drugs.<br>  <br>  look at Truehope    www.truehope.com   1-888-truehope<br>  <br>  Did lots of drugs in past ended up in Psych Hospital and messed up with Psych drugs for 25 years....but now psych drug free thanks to Truehope.|`|KasFZL7laa	absolutely.  <br>  <br>  but yeah marijuana is not addictive.|`|yT6Mezweaa	Grrr, ignorant people make me mad. lol just kidding.<br>  <br>  Marijuana is *not* addictive in the slightest bit. I don't know why people think this. Probably they think its a drug so it is evil and addicting. People who say they are addicted just have no will power and enjoy getting high which I don't blame them.<br>  <br>  But back to your question, Yes some of them are as addictive as harder drugs like X or Heroine.
4a8c2087c08e27dd972f6e6779709072aa	I've been a diabetic since I was 8 and now I'm 17. I'm not allowed to go on the pump :-( until I learn to count carbs. My A1C is 6.2 because I get so many low blood sugars.

EXYfRJu6aa	I know that you're going to think that this sounds silly but it sounds to me that you're not eating enough. If you are eating too little food it will slow down your metabolism. If you get the proper amount of calories it will keep your metabolism high and burn up the fat that you're trying to lose. I suggest that you find a good nutritionist/dietician(not a doctor) who will be able to go over your daily food consumption and explain the amount of food and the number of meals you will need to eat each day to lose weight..|`|b4wwddhbaa	You aren't eating enough.  Your body is probably in starvation mode, hoarding as much as it possibly can.  You have to give your body fuel if you want it to burn the fuel.  Also, your metabolism slows to a crawl when you starve yourself.  Determine what your daily caloric intake should be, then aim for that goal rather than not eating.  Exercise should increase your daily calorie goal too.  And never skip a meal.|`|1en1Jtp4aa	_You're twisted. I know cause I ran track as a child apparently I ran so fast that I out ran my friends.

xJ0HJKlXaa	hey, i had almost the same symptoms, except tons of pain when i ran and when i did almost anything. i did a 6 month set of physical thereapy after havign an MRI and X rays and other tests, and then went back since that didn't help, and then did a different variant of PT for 9 months, and that didn't help, and they still didn't know what was wrong, and so they did surgery, and i ended up with a thing called a plica. it's when the sac surrounding your knee to keep the fluids in gets folded into your knee somehow, and then gets hard and starts rubbing things like bone and tendons really bad. they took out three inches of it.... it all started when i tore MCL and meniscus when i was 13. i had surgery at 17....   ask your doctor abou tthe possibility of a plica as there is no way to diagnose it without exploratory surgery. they won't so the surgery unless they've tested for other things first though.... but my doctors never even thought about the possibility of a plica. you could easily have gotten stuff folded in during the accident and not noticed the ill effects until now... it took four years for me to reall ybe bothered by it bad enough to go in again. and i play on two soccer teams and run cross country and ride horses and do swim team.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	You don't have the symptoms of peri-menopause yet.  You'll get hot flashes and night sweats, cold flashes, and your periods will get heavier and you'll join the 'black pants society' (due to sudden and intermittent bleeding) ... then you'll go into a 'strange period' where your periods may 'shorten' or you may have one agonizingly long period (one whole year).  Menopause is when you 'stop having periods entirely' that LASTS one full year.  If you take birth control pills, you may continue to 'have periods' because of the pills, and the same goes with taking hormones for the 'hot flashes.'  I'm one of the few who went through the whole of peri-menopause and menopause with 'no hormones' of any kind, not because I 'wanted to' but because my doctor was very worried about me, due to the fact I had two major heart attacks a month apart, and had two 'stents' put into my heart.  Hormones were 'seriously contraindicated' for me.  I'm now about 5 years 'past menopause' ... no more heart attacks (so far, knock wood) and am 'healthier than before' ... I also have no more night sweats and hot flashes, but my hands and feet are constantly freezing, and I have trouble with my 'inner thermostat' ... my husband says I'm 'schizothermic' which seems to be the 'worst' of being a 'crone' ... so far.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	It's a little bit more complex than this.  Certain bacteria have a certain affinity for an age group, and depending on what age you are, you have a risk of meningitis from a certain bacteria.<br>  <br>  In younger people it tends to be neisseria meningitidis (the one that affects a lot of kids/teenagers/college kids), and in older people it tends to be streptococcus pneumoniae (elderly).  The reason this occurs is still not quite known, but it may have to do with immunity and other body mechanisms to keep out bacteria.<br>  <br>  THat being said, I have seen MANY cases of meningitis in middle aged/older people, and although the publicity is more directed towards the younger people (because it is lethal or can cause severe brain damage), it can affect people at any age.<br>  <br>  That being said, it is still quite a rare disease, and your odds of contracting it randomly are quite low.|`|YqQ2SFDcaa	I think (common Sense) that young people are not fully developed and have not experienced different types of bacteria so that's why they get.

I don't know if it happened because I was dieting hard to lose the weight I gained during the pregnancy or if I got up too fast?  I don't know why it happened, but it was a one time thing and I am grateful for that.  If your MRI came back OK, try not to worry.  Just get a lot of rest (I know that is hard with a new baby) and make sure to eat.

jmXooeunaa	You burn approx the same. The first person is totally off. Just think about this. When you run 4 miles... your heart beat will be up around 160 for 30ish mins ( or however long it takes you) and if you walk your heart rate will be like 100 for 1 hour and halfish ( or however long it takes). So running is a short amount of time, but your heart beat is going faster. Walking is a longer amount of time, but your heart rate is going slower. So you should burn the same amount of calories.|`|3WcCeOqdaa	Running or walking 4 miles will cause the same number of calories to be burned, however you just do it more quickly by running.|`|ByVkqiSCaa	absolutely not - it depends on intensity, so you will probably burn 10x more calories running

FicyC2TXaa	Yes they can; they have breast tissue and so can get breast cancer.<br>  <br>  It's rare though. Fewer  than 1% of all those diagnosed with breast cancer are male.<br>  <br>  Most men diagnosed with it are over 60, but through breast cancer support networks I've met a few men with breast cancer in their 40s and 50s.<br>  ===========<br>  <br>  Just for comparison, since there seems to be a bit of a feeling here that breast cancer in men isn't rare. April's pointed out that it killed 450 men last year, which of course is 450 too many.<br>  <br>  Breast cancer kills an average of 112 women every day in the US - that's one every 15 minutes. In the UK the figure is 33 a day.<br>  <br>  In  2005, there were  211,400 women and 1,690 men  diagnosed with breast cancer in the US.|`|flKkoiwbaa	It's rare, but yes, men can get breast cancer|`|mUMMLjDdaa	it is extremely rare, but yes, men can get breast cancer.|`|i4QYyUsRaa	Yes and it is NOT rare.|`|LzJMaw2Iaa	Absolutely.  Breast cancer is a cancer that occurs in mammary tissue, which is present in both men and women.  The reason breast cancer is more prevalent among women is because women, obviously, have significantly more mammary tissue than men do.  The reason you don't often hear about breast cancer in men is that the term "breast" is used to refer to the female body and there is a social stigma attached to referring to the male chest as a breast.  That said, breast (or mammary) cancer is not as rare among men as it may seem it's just not talked about as freely as it is with women.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	Yes, about 1/100 cases of breast cancer are in males.  Usually fairly easy to recognize early just because of the lack of tissue.  Signs are a lump, fevers/chills/sweats/weight loss, and sometimes swelling and lymph nodes on the affected side (in the armpit/shoulder)|`|bc3042b339e70eec48f0ba92ee67e9d6aa	Yes.

3VeqE9Oaaa	Hi Re,<br>  <br>  You need to eat 5-6 meals per day, balances of carbs, protein, and healthy fats. I talk to guys like you at the gym each day....you need to eat things like grilled chicken, talapia, tuna, lean red meat, egg whites/with 1 yolk, oatmeal, potatoes, a drop of olive oil over veggies or a small salad, save your shakes for after training and before bed. You must eat "clean" in order for your stomach not to show your fat, that's the first place it goes. As far as calories, you need to write everything you eat down, and adjust those calories....see what works, and change as needed, if you start seeing fat, cut back, etc. You can't turn fat into muscle! You can build muscle easily though, if you are supporting your training with enough calories, with a balanced diet, this works to benefit muscle building. Also, remember, by eating 5-6 small meals per day, your metabolism will run efficiently, so you build muscle, and you won't store fat. And, remember, don't train everyday for muslce building results.....4-days, that's it!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!  Good luck!|`|f4ehvRQlaa	eat bread and drink milk.|`|0ef851000b538b263ac2c3058c608291aa	get some protien powder, it will build up mass and then you can turn it into lean mean muscles.|`|jvHUsl3uaa	eat a lot more protein and have six meals a day.

tHj6tPyPaa	I would think sugar because its natural whereas splenda although clamming not to have calories probably have chemicals in it or something else wrong with it|`|ThdFMIFUaa	Sugar is definitely healthier. Splenda and other artificial sweeteners have tons of chemicals, additives, and other things you wouldn't want in your body. They actually make you gain weight because a) they mess with your metabolism and b) when you eat artificial sugar, than there is something triggered in your brain that knows you're eating something sweet. When your bloodstream doesn't receive the sugar, you crave sugar for the rest of the day, causing you to overeat.<br>  <br>  Sugar isn't healthy, but it's a much better choice than Splenda. Sugar is okay to eat if you use it sparingly.<br>  <br>  If you want to sweeten your food naturally, try honey, agave nectar, or stevia extract. The last two can be found at health food stores.|`|Mi9J34Niaa	It depends on which you prefer Diabetes (sugar) or Cancer (splenda).|`|6mMAvL7kaa	Splenda is because it is a sweetener and doesn't contain any sugar.|`|YWjB85I0aa	Splenda,<br>  no calories,<br>  doesn't rot your teeth either :}
sO13nCh6aa	They are actually calculating your heart rate (and possibly respiration rate) when they do that.  <br>  There is no way to determine a blood pressure by feeling a pulse and looking at a clock.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	That's pulse rate they're measuring.  They need to wrap that thing around your arm; pump it up and then listen for when the blood flow stops and starts, to measure systolic and diastolic pressure., which they read on the dial of the pressure measuring device (called a sphygmomanometer BTW - pronounced like suh-figmo-ma-nom-itter).|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	She is counting the heart beat count, not the blood pressure.|`|vr996LtZaa	Blood pressure is taken by useing a cuff and a stethoscope. The cuff is pumped up until it restricts blood flow to the lower arem. As the cuff is loosened, the blood will begin to flow and that is the first number measured. For instance, the number may be 120. When there is no longer any sound from the stathoscope, the bottom number is then reached. The number mey be 80.<br>  120/80 is a normal blood pressure reading. The top number is how much pressure the blood id exerting on the artery walls. The bottom number represents the resting ability of the heart.|`|NvMXrbmnaa	Feeling someone's pulse and looking at the clock is the technique used to count the heart rate.<br>  <br>  Taking a manual blood pressure involves a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope. The nurse puts the BP cuff around the upper arm, places the stethoscope in the bend of the elbow and then inflates the BP cuff. The nurse slowly deflates the cuff and listens for the first beat of the pulse. When this is heard she/he notes the pressure on the gauge, this is the systolic pressure or top number. When the last beat is heard the nurse notes the pressure (the number on the gauge) this is the diastolic or bottom number. After the last beat is heard the cuff is quickly deflated the rest of the way. <br>  <br>  For someone young and healthy, the cuff only needs to be inflated to about 130. For someone with known high blood pressure (such as the elderly) the cuff needs to be inflated to a higher pressure to ensure that the first beat is heard. If you hear beating as soon as you are done inflating, this indicates that the blood pressure is higher than the pressure on the gauge and you should inflate it some more to get an accurate reading.<br>  <br>  There are also blood pressure machines. All you do with these is put the cuff around the upper, turn it on, and press start. The machine reads the pressure and no stethoscope is involved.<br>  <br>  Here is a video that is good if you are a visual learner. It adds and extra step in it that helps explain the amount of pressure initially needed to inflate the cuff. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYcSrcLVJHI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYcSrcLVJ...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful!

You can buy at a drug store or grocery store - you do not have to get at Health Foods store, however, you can get there also.  I have also heard that ginger is good for upset stomach.

They essentially do the same thing, help your body recover more rapidly than if you weren't using them. Creatine is a substance that naturally occurs in your muscles and you taking more over the counter will help your body process out lactic acid as well as help your muscles heal after a workout. Protein aides recovery in an indirect way, fueling the creatine in your body to repair muscles. Both would be best for overall, but keep in mind that extra creatine in your muscles can lead to severe cramping due to dehydration. DRINK LOTS OF WATER if you go down that road.|`|4XuzRpE7aa	Creatine is more ''dangerous'' and effective than whey protein but you don't need anyone's advice to take whey protein.It is  more effective when you exercise and helps you gain weight..
AA12317425	An echo looks at the overall structure and function of your heart.  It looks at how the valves are working, how the blood is moving through the heart and how well the heart muscle is squeezing.  If the atherosclerosis is severe enough that it is blocking/reducing blood flow the heart muscle then it could be detected on the echo in the form of a wall motion abnormality (meaning that part of the heart is not moving/squeezing as well as the rest of the heart muscle).  In a normal resting echo the blockage has to be pretty significant in order for it to be detected.  A stress echo is a better way to determine if atherosclerosis is present.  This is where an echo is performed before and after exercise to see if "stressing" the heart can bring about/cause a wall motion abnormality.<br>  <br>  Ultimately the best way to determine atherosclerosis is by performing  an angiogram via a heart cath.

If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women.

Just drink lots of fluids!|`|6vyWV0R6aa	its a great sing it means that your body is throwing out the infection that you have in your stomach or body system dont worry about it but if you need to vommit do it it will help your body take everything out but drink lots of water or drinks with electriolites because if you have the fever and throw up you can get dihydrated|`|1EBn5A6daa	no it's not good, be careful not to get dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids now, your probably getting over the worst of it...you'll be fine
MMe5yPEaaa	its easy.i got a diet list its protein based so you lose very fast.it doesnt give you 3 meals an 3 or 4 snacs.. its pretty strict but you also dont have to starve. i do the diet time by time when i put weight on and it always works..<br>  <br>  the reason that i am typing this all but not the list is that you are just 14.. and i wouldnt like you to have health problems because of it. <br>  <br>  definetelly want the list? let me know..|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|VHmNfHa6aa	First losing 5lbs is easy...you can do that in a week or two.

Q4ggnG0waa	We are all responsible for our own actions.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Smoking didnt cause lung cancer in me, but it did cause leukemia.<br>  <br>  Ultimatly, I blame myself because at the end of the line I am responsible for my own actions.  However, I have to tell you, when I picked up that first cig when I was 13, the health risks were the farthest from my mind.  Most of the adults in my family smoked.  My uncle died of a smoking related cancer, but that wasnt until years later. My aunt had a heart attack when I was 12, but that was more due to other risks factors than smoking.  My mom smoked and never even tried to quit.  I just wasnt worried about something that only might happen 60 years down the road.<br>  <br>  Too bad I was only 21 when I was diagnosed.<br>  <br>  I DO however, feel that the tobacco companies do need to take some sort of responsibility.  Their advertising is limited now, but they used to and sort of still do target young people in their ads.  There is no real reason why they have to add in all those additives that make commercial cigs so dangerous.  I basically feel like the cig companies do everything they can to get people to smoke and keep smoking.   As I said, at the end of the day i am responsible for my own actions, but when and where do the cig companies take repsonsibility for THEIR actions???|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	I was a smoker and am a breast cancer survivor.<br>  <br>  Had my diagnosis been lung cancer, I could only blame myself. <br>  <br>  But as there is a poor link between smoking and breast cancer, there is no one for me to blame.<br>  <br>  In most cases, a cancer patient/survivor who looks for someone to blame, is not working through the acceptance process all the way.<br>  <br>  And by the way, don't kid yourself. We all think we're immune to cancer because we're "healthy," "have a good immune system,"  are rich, pretty, don't smoke, don't go to tanning salons, whatever. No one thinks they are going to get it. For the vast majority of people who get cancer, they really didn't DO anything to deserve it. Get over yourself.|`|U1chPjvPaa	Its called an addiction.

9Eebavmiaa	Well...I had it in for almost 2 years. Loved the fact I didn't have to take a pill, no period, no mood swings...etc. However, I had ovarian cysts something horrible from it. They told me it would leave, and it never did. Just got worse and worse. I ended up with 9 at one time and they all ruptured shortly after I got it removed (November of 08). I'm much happier without it, however 4 of my best friends have it, love it and have never had any problems with it. So, my advice is-if you don't have problems with ovarian cysts, bladder or yeast infections-go for it. If you do, try something else. Good luck!
AA11476749	The sauna makes you sweat, but any "weight" you lose goes right back on with the first beverage you consume afterward.<br>  <br>  Saunas help you with eliminating various toxins/impurities from your body, and are helpful in reducing stress.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	it will not get rid of fat only water weight|`|AOCqOTfBaa	The sauna helps you get rid of this extra salt and thereby gets you rid of the water weight that you have gained. If you want to maintain the weight loss you enjoy from visiting the sauna, you need to keep salt consumption to a minimum in your diet.<br>  <br>  Hence, the sauna does indeed help you loose weight though not in the regular way of melting fat. The heat usually forces the body sweat out the excess salt and toxins and thereby reduced a great deal of your water weight. Combined with a healthy and salt free (or reduced salt) diet, you could enjoy the new found way of staying trim and healthy. Good luck!|`|a50adc767b2a79758a91103f0f987b08aa	One of the lesser known health benefits of saunas is that you can use this relaxing, stress-relieving time to lose weight! We all know that stress is one of the causes of overeating and studies have shown that by bathing for longer sessions (30 minutes or more), you can burn up to 500 calories, which is about what you would burn on a 3-mile run.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	you can lose weight yes, but it is all water weight and you will gain it right back<br>  <br>  best bet diet and exercise|`|gF49d7Jcaa	Not really... after a full-body work-out it can help a bit, not a huge amount though.|`|s7f9ojYMaa	What other people have said is true.  You'll sweat a lot in the sauna causing you to lose weight - this is almost entirely water though, so as soon as your drink the water will be absorbed in to the body again to prevent you dehydrating.<br>  <br>  Saunas are healthy though and great for detox.  Regular use alongside exercise will help muscle recovery and improve your exercise...therefore helping to lose weight that way.<br>  <br>  The best way to lose weight in a sauna is to do some exercise while in the sauna!! Its very hard going but gives you a great workout while detoxing at the same time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|pQNwuyuvaa	Weight loss hypnosis program helps you loss the weight you want and keep it off forever.|`|AA12093442	not a lot. approx an hour or more worth equals less than one pound<br>  <br>  but it feels good and helps create perspiration which is good for your muscles
h6cAhPs6aa	i suggest to go back to your doctor again,  or a spinal cord doctor, or talk to a chiropractor they will look at it again and take some x-rays. etc. that's a long time since you where seen.  go back until your happy with the results.  especially if you are in so much pain. an orthopedic might help you too.
JwecpnBVaa	More cardio and toning exercises, drink lots of water.  Don't eat meat like sausage, stick with turkey and chicken, and always avoid pasta and bread.  You are eating way way way too much, change to eating every three hours, but don't eat so much!  Eat about 200 calories per meal.  Stop eating so freakin much if you wanna lose weight, easy on the carbs and meat for goodness sake.

If they really start to hurt, go see your doctor and they will give you exercises to them back into good shape again; they also might give you painkillers for free if you are in pain.  But try hard not to click them (I know it's hard, I've been in the same situation) it's really bad for them. In your spare time just wiggle them or move them to keep your mind off actually clicking them!  This will also keep your fingers more supple. Hope this helps!

d2FJBJ8baa	umm actually a crown usually comes after a root canal<br>  <br>  putting a crown on a teeth won't stop it from getting worse<br>  the root canal will clean the root of the teeth out and the dentist might put a post in your tooth and then fill it. then comes the crown, the crown is there for protection of the rest of the fragile tooth.<br>  i have 2 crowns in my mouth and it feels fine. it's nothing to be scared of. the dentist will use freezing so you won't feel anything. sometimes there are pain after but it's more like little bit of discomfort but it goes away in no time.|`|733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	Listen people are not overacting to a root canal because I had one supposedly after being put to sleep but I felt everything.  I was strapped to the chair and could not move.  They put something in your mouth to screw out your teeth roots over and over and then they unscrew them like a real f--unscrew and yank them out like a nail .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My hold face was full of blood and when I got out that chair I yelled like crazy.  That's not the half of it when I ran out pass the waiting room I heard the dentist tell his assistant that she had not given me enough anesthesia to deaden the pain.  The worst part is that less than a year later I still had to lose my tooth in the front of my mouth after I had went through all that and I know at least 6 people that had lost theirs after a root canal too. So if I had to do it all over I would simply had a tooth extraction and called it a day.  Besides it cost a arm and a leg!<br>  The only satisfaction I got out of the horrifying experience was half the folks siting in the waiting room left when they saw me!|`|122540ad7c1b7d43a80ccb07741d0171aa	Relax......I used to actually fall asleep while my dentist did the root canal work.  Not due to and medications, I've had plenty of those with no reaction. Just due to a relaxed state of mind. If you don't mind the local anesthetic and having your mouth held open (comfortably) for 45 minutes at time it's a breeze.|`|RNHrRiwsaa	What to expect with a crown? drilling and at least two visits.<br>  what to expect from a root canal? Pain, lots of it.|`|4AL6Nj36aa	I feel your pain! Many people struggle with dentists and are really unsure what to expect. Thanks to today's technology and anesthesia there isn't much pain in either a root canal or a crown. To answer your second question. "Are people over reacting"? The answer is Yes. Todays dentists have a wide range of tools and drugs that are used to make the visit as painless as absolutely possible. The worst pain you will feel these days is the actual injection of the anesthesia or numbing medicine into your gums. I hope I have eased your mind a little bit.. Have a great day! Katrina:)|`|xwZV9jgPaa	i think your mistaken on what your dr said....if they are going to put a crown on they will first do a root canal, its not like they just cover up a rotten tooth with a crown. you need a root canal b/c the infection has gone down into the pulp of your tooth. After they remove the pulp and the root f your tooth they will place a crown over the top of it. Other option would be to get it pulled and for them to put in some sort of a spacer so your teeth don't grow together. It's not one or the other.  Root canals are not fun. Depending on your tolorence for pain and the reaction you have to laughing gas you may be fine. Me....I had to get doped up and take a bunch of valium before I went in. I took my ipod and turned it up as loud as I could. I eventually passed out and when I woke up I felt like I had been screaming the whole time, my jaw and throat hurt so much.|`|1EBn5A6daa	oh no honey they are fine, i've had 5 and still need 2 more, i have horrible teeth, hehehe or just love sweets and cola too much, but don't worry the only thing you will feel is the needle to numb your tooth. ask for laughing gas(nitrous oxide) it helps if your nervous, but don't be you'll be fine and once the root canal is actually done you will never again feel a thing from that toot, not even when you get the cap on because the nerve to that tooth is gone after the procedure, good luck but you will be okay|`|YupMCYHlaa	Some people can't handle -any- dental work.  A root canal is almost just like getting a filling, except it takes longer and it's a little more complicated.  They numb the tooth with novocaine.  Then they drill down the channel in the tooth that holds the nerve (the 'root canal').  The use tiny little files to scrape out the nerve, then they fill the channel with an inert material. Then the top of the hole is capped off like a filling.  It takes maybe 45 minutes.<br>  <br>  After that, the tooth will get brittle, so they usually want to put a crown on it.  The dentist deadens the area with novocaine again. He drills around the tooth to make it sort of a little peg.  Then they take an impression, which is used to make a cap that fits on top of the little stump.  He puts on a temporary crown. In a week the real crown comes in from the lab and you go back and they glue it on.<br>  <br>  The crown is made to penetrate just below the gumline.  I have several crowns, and for me the most uncomfortable part is that they ahve to drill the tooth down around the gumline, and after the novocaine wears off it's a little sore.  Not a big deal though.<br>  <br>  The worst part, for me, are the novocaine injections.  I hate needles. The rest is mostly painless.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	Wrong!<br>  <br>  Joking.

mmVpi8Z2aa	It's hard to descibe what panic feels like.  When I had anxiety problems a year ago, I was dwelling on things that were stupid, like my breathing and my heart.  It felt like they were hurting, but in reality, they were fine.<br>  <br>  A panic attack was kind of like an implosion for me.  I'd think and dwell on something to the point I got scared.  My body would jolt, I'd take a quick, sharp breath, and my heart would beat rapidly.<br>  <br>  A big factor for me was my mental and physical state.  If I was stressed, I'd dwell on things and fret about them.  Panic attacks were more frequent.  If I was tired, they'd be more frequent.<br>  <br>  I'm 99.9% panic free now.  The key for me is to live a relaxed lifestyle, and NOT dwell on things.  Another one is to talk to someone.  For me, it's my girlfriend; since she and I have been together, I've only had a few panic attacks.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

1JbWMSataa	Well, it depends on what you consider low. A "low calorie" diet is usually one that's 1000 - 1500 calories a day. That type of diet, if the right foods are eaten, will help you lose weight, especially in combination with exercise. <br>  <br>  A "very low calorie" diet is typically under 800 calories a day. It can cause nutritional deficits, fatigue, and a very slow metabolism, but is sometimes recommended by a Dr. to very obese people who need to lose weight rapidly.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	weight loss, muscle loss and a slower metabolic rate.|`|oDz0FQpEaa	low energy. <br>  fat loss. <br>  muscle loss. <br>  fatigue. <br>  obsessive calorie counting. <br>  anorexia. <br>  not good really. <br>  you should aim for the recommended daily amount and try to get enough exercise each week.|`|twy8S0L2aa	little weight gain, not healthy in the long run

I am a little concerned that the lesion is painful as this is not at all typical of lipomas which are painless.

dpgXzMenaa	About 2/3 will admit it, but it's probably close to the 70%.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's over 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Even so, about 10% of women never orgasm at all in their lifetime... and since only about 1 in 2000 women who mastrurbate regularly *don't* have orgasms that way, it's safe to say that about 10% of women never masturbate (almost always this is because of negative messages in their childhood... which is a *crime* in my books.)|`|KaDuWf0Qaa	Probably all but the really religious ones that think it's a sin.|`|vweOVGxDaa	Ermmm..

If you are still suffering excessive sweating after trying different methods, then you can try to ask medical professionals<br>  <br>  Also there is treatment like Iontophoresis which is a non-surgical treatment. It is only works for mild to excessive hyperhidrosis. Other treatment is Endoscopic Thoracic Symphathectomy (ETS).|`|oH68ltZJaa	shave your armpits, that will stop you from sweating. it does not make you less of a man, if keeps you fresh and clean.|`|yO7UTJrsaa	Shave your armpits everyday it keeps them clean, and if that doesn't work, wash it like you would wash ur hair.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|SAgCy83Oaa	You didn't GAIN it "fast like" now did you?

Our bodies are made to survive, so if you drastically cut calories, the body will slow down to conserve the energy.  Unfortunately, you have to do it in stages.  the fastest way is really increase the physical activity, so your body's metabolism speeds up to burn the calories.   Couple things that will really help:  don't eat after 6pm.  If you do need to eat, no starches.  maybe a cheese stick, low fat yogurt, or the sort.<br>  Secondly, for exercise, getting into functional training is the fastest way to burn calories.  Mixing up cardio, with functional movements and weights will spike your bodies metabolism.  there is plenty of exercises on the web that teach you this.  dumbells and some resistance bands do the trick.  good luck|`|AA10695203	easy come easy go, you have to understand the faster you lose weight, the faster you will regain it and possibly even more weight, just moderately diet, excercise, like walking, swimming, perhaps jogging even 2 km a day will make a major difference...................good luck!!|`|YWjB85I0aa	Faddy diets don't work<br>  once you stop them you pile on the pounds again.<br>  Its simple, you eat healthily,<br>  cut down on the food you eat,<br>  smaller portions, less junk food, more greens ect<br>  and exercise every day.<br>  atleast 1 hour

87756LlTaa	You should eat and drink something, even if it is small and healthy.  10 lbs in a month is a very reasonable goal, and you can do this with 1500 (or more) calories a day if you exercise 30 mins a day 4-6 times a week.  Going long periods causes your body to go into a starvation mode.  This will increase certain hormones for gluconeogenesis and glucolysis.  When you do finally eat, your body will think that it will have to starve again, and try to hold on to those calories even more.  So, eat reasonably and exercise.  You'll lose your weight, and you won't have to starve.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|2JqdC8VSaa	Yes thats fine, try having lil snacks in between tho , like berrys and buts they help and arnt fatting
RP5NnxgUaa	Possibly. A typical woman's cycle is 28 days and ovulating occurs right in the middle so 2 weeks after you get your period. I always get small cramps and discharge around the 2 weeks mark. It's porbably just that. No worries!|`|dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	yep ovulating...it usually happens right before your period and or right after your period|`|2zLtIog3aa	and that is why I am gay... no offense ladies, but YUCK!!!

Try new exercises and body parts on the same night.  When I would go heavy weights and low reps like you are mentioning I always noticed that I would get sore with slightly higher reps to failure.  Try a weight you can do get 12-15 times, but at 15 you can't do 16 for example (could be any # really).<br>  <br>  Try that and try switching up exercises and routines.  I went with a friend who was doing P90X and did chest and back with him- most exercises are to failure- and I was sore for 3-4 days from that and I can do more than 100 push up and 35 pull ups at once- and I was still sore.  I have not been sore like that again doing that routine, but just the change of pace was great.

K4zsztkRaa	No you are not. It's called using condoms and watching who you sleep with. If you have unprotected sex with someone infected with HIV, your going to get HIV it doesn't matter if you are circumcised or not.<br>  <br>  I think it's easier to have sex uncircumcised, it feels a lot better too. I was circumcised at birth but I am naturaly resotring my foreskin and as I grow more skin sex has more of a gliding motion rather than a griding motion. Uncircumcised sex feels better, the orgasms are more intense and last longer and it's a much easier gliding sensation.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|AA11522944	The British Association of Paediatric Urologists states that ‘There is no current evidence to support an increased risk of penile cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection (AIDS) or cervical cancer’ associated with the presence of a foreskin and that ‘Circumcision to prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) is unproven except in boys with abnormal renal tracts.’<br>   <a href="http://www.baps.org.uk/documents/circumcision2007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.baps.org.uk/documents/circumc...</a>|`|zLUQJxJkaa	No that's false.

They halted the study early because it had already proven their point, but what they don't tell you is that they only had it going for 6 weeks. During that 6 weeks, they circed group was not having sex because of their wound, so OF COURSE they didn't get HIV!!!! America and Africa has the highest HIV rates in the world, they are also the main places where circumcision is common! If anything, circumcision reduces the bodies resistance to HIV! Because of the increased friction during sex that is caused by the lack of a foreskin, both the penis and the vagina get micro tears during sex that make it easier for HIV to enter the body.<br>  <br>  Not only that, but think about it, CONDOMS protect form HIV, not a partial penis! If anything, that is dangerous, because people would be thinking that they are immune to HIV and not use protection! <br>  <br>  *************Even *IF* that is true, it does NOT protect men form oral sex. I would say it safe to say that if they are having vaginal intercourse, then they are giving and recieving oral sex**************|`|zEy0uuAFaa	This story comes from a study that was done a few years ago that found that intact men had a very slightly higher risk contracting HIV than cut men during sex without a condom, probably because of some immune-related cells on the underside of the foreskin.  However, this is a red herring, because the the chance of contracting HIV is hundreds of times greater when having sex without a condom, whether the man is circumcised or not.  The solution is simply to wear a condom and choose your sex partners carefully, not cut off a valuable and sensitive part of your penis.<br>  <br>  There's also a theory that the loss of sensitivity connected with circumcision can motivate men toward more risky sex behavior to make up for the numbness.<br>  <br>  After the damage from circumcision is healed, a man is just as able to have sex as before.  However, some find sex less satisfying because the have less nerve endings left to enjoy it with.  Like the way food tastes when you have a bad cold, because you can't smell anything.|`|K5SGG1QYaa	this is NOT TRUE<br>  <br>  the statistics show a slightly lower rate of aids in circumcised men ONLY because, worldwide, men who are circumcised are more likely to come from traditional, religious backgrounds and are therefore less likely to be promiscuous and contract the infection. in most countries, circumcisions take place only for religious reasons within particular religious groups, unlike in the usa where the vast majority are just circumcised because. if theres any physical difference ie the habitat for bacteria, it would only effect those with unusually poor personal hygene and even then the difference would be minimal (ie less that a percent difference) and would make no real difference if you were exposed to the disease.<br>  <br>  being circumcised does NOT protect you from aids, if you're circumcised you would be just as likely to get aids than someone who wasn't if you slept with an infected person. WEAR A CONDOM.<br>  <br>  about africa, as some guy said above, thats because of the more traditional religious culture thing. circumcision can not be seen as an answer to this problem. even if it were true (which its clearly not), fifty percent better are not good odds, people need to play safe and use condoms, which are one hundred percent effective when used properly.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Condoms prevent the spread of HIV+ ~  circumcision does not.<br>  <br>  HIV is spread through seminal fluid, breastmilk and contact with infected blood... not by contact with foreskin.<br>  <br>  A person who has unprotected receptive anal intercourse has a higher chance of contracting HIV than a person who is penetrative.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	in a 10 year study 98% of females developed ovarian cancer or HPV .<br>  Their husbands were uncut.|`|OTiLeig8aa	Yes you are, and not only HIV, you're more likely to contract other STD's if you're not circumcised.|`|CN0cLscZaa	that is absolutely not true|`|TYFSWhh3aa	nope.|`|zFgYaQ5Jaa	Oh no no no.<br>  <br>   The only way you can get aids during sex is if its unprotected. The sperm of the vaginal fluid/blood will be what spreads it, and a condom stops that all.<br>  <br>   Now, there are rumors about the whole about Uncircumcised men have a better feeling during sex, and that is partially true. The fact that we have the foreskin left seems to make it a much more pleasurable experience... And an explanation? Its because the foreskin is there to protect the helmet of the penis, and without it its sensitivity increases, unlike that of a circumcised penis, which is grown accustomed to the feeling of air, and cloths and what not. [Though, this is just my personal opinion, but I believe it seems valid.] <br>  <br>   Though, at the same time uncircumcised men are at a much larger risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs), as well as penal disorders and what not.|`|RPpJpfvmaa	Yea, your f***ed

Sometimes you can see this bacteria by looking on the top of your tongue, it is often white in color.  This must be removed if you are to control bad breath.

Most halitosis comes from something in the mouth. Food sticks between your teeth, around the gums and on your tongue. If you don't brush and floss your teeth every day, this food can rot. The rotten bits of food cause a bad smell in your mouth. Rotten food also helps bacteria to grow in your mouth. This bacteria can cause gum disease, or gingivitis. Gingivitis also causes bad breath.The things you eat and drink affect your breath. Common examples of foods and beverages that may cause bad breath include onions, garlic, cheese, pastrami, certain spices, orange juice and soda. Once food is digested and its oils are absorbed into the bloodstream, they're carried into the lungs. The odour is given off in your breath. Bad breath may also be a sign of a health problem. Chronic lung infections, liver or kidney diseases and diabetes are some conditions that may cause bad breath.<br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

KhTK3Sjsaa	I would have to say assisted suicide as well. <br>  After watching my grandmother in the hospital dying, she was unconscious, unable to speak, hear, see or anything, but only being able to feel pain and cry out in pain, I would never want to see to that happen to anyone. <br>  Although I love my Grandmother more than life itself, my family and I would just pray that she would die, so that she would no longer have to suffer. We were all aware that she was going to die anyways, and it was her wish to not rely on anything to keep her living, but watching her suffer for over a week until she finally passed on was the hardest thing i have ever had to witness. It was absolutely horrific, yet we all wanted to be there for when she did pass away, so we didn't leave her side. If assisted suicide were legal, then she could have passed away peacefully, and not have suffered such an (unnecessarily) agonizing death. <br>  Nobody wants their loved ones to die, but wouldn't you rather they do peacefully, and at a time when they know they are ready to go, then watch them suffer?<br>  <br>  Just my thoughts!|`|9EVcTnUWaa	A living will what neither of your other answers seem to understand is that in a living will you can put what ever conditions that you want.

In a living will you can state what medications you want given, what types of treatments you'll accept and what measures you want used if you're terminally ill. You can say if you want or don't want a feeding tube, You can say whether or not you want to be on a respirator, you can say how much pain medications you want or don't want.

yFX0mdOhaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You are fine.  My major in college was Kinesiology, and we did lots of tests and experiments while wearing a hear rate monitor.  There is a HUGE difference between laying down, not moving a muscle, being completly relaxed, and sitting up in a chair, or watching TV.  As crazy as it sounds, your heart rate can jump up from the slightest things.  We did tests where we were just putting  a golf ball, and our heart rates were recoded on a computer.  Just walking to the ball made our heart rates jump by 15-20 bpm.  Standing still, our heart rates would jump up right before we hit the ball, just out of concentration.  We did another test where we did the same put, but the teacher offered a gift card to the best putter.  Just that added pressure added like 20-30 bpm on our heart rates.  <br>  <br>  You should expect it to fluxuate all day while you are sitting, thinking, walking etc.  84 is fine!  The only was to get a true Base heart rate reading, is to lye down, be completely still, and be completely calm and relaxed... that's why they say to do it when you first wake up.  Simple worrying about what you are going to do later will add 10+ BPM on your heartrate.<br>  <br>  You are fine!!!|`|0b6b9f60bb6870d870e9293391c0c742aa	There's nothing wrong with a heart rate of 84 bpm. When it gets over 90, then there may be an underlying problem. Actually, if you take it when watching TV, it may just be higher than usual just because you're really into whatever you're watching, especially if what you're watching has a load of action or suspense or even drama in it. This is why it's best to take it when you wake up. I guarantee that if you do you'd notice a heart rate under 80 bpm. My heart rate ranges anywhere from 70 - 78 bpm when resting, so obviously it varies. Don't take it only once, keep checking over a period of time, and if it never exceeds 90 bpm, the  you have nothing to worry about.|`|29cIlSwgaa	Take Long Cardio Vascular Brisk Walks. Ten Minutes Warm Up, 30-45 Minutes Brisk Walking & Ten Minutes Cool Down. If Walking is not fun try Swimming, Cycling, Badminton, Tennis or any other Aerobic Exercise. No Weights Please. Follow up with Meditation and Pranayam Yoga (breathing Exercises) for 15 Minutes. You are young at 20 Years. You should be able to take your Heart Rate to 85% of your Target Heart Rate during Aerobics, which is 220-20 = 85% of 200 Beats Per Minute. Good News is that once your Heart works that fast, it slows down and RESTS for the rest of the day and your BPR comes down. Quieten your mind by yoga & meditation. <br>  <br>   Iam not as young as you are. My Heart Rate was 88 BPM. It came down to 56 BPM (Sitting on my couch in the evening) in 15 Days. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes|`|GyBeE7ofaa	If you want your REAL resting heart rate, you have to take it right after you wake up and before you get out of bed. Otherwise, it's just your normal active heart rate and it's within normal range.  The 6 beats over the limit is insignificant. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you're serious about lowering it though, you should take up an aerobic exercise, like running or even fast walking. No dieting is necessary. After a month, you should see a big difference.

It is not from the sun though.  It is a fungus.  The bed was dirty.  I'm not sure where she would have got it from seeing as she probably isnt lying in any tanning beds:)  It wasn;t a big deal once I finally went to the doc.  She prescribed me some antibiotics and it cleared up completely within a month.  No big deal other than the doc visits equalled about 200 bucks.  Good Luck:)|`|udfFt5Rlaa	Sounds like a fungus.  Crazy I know, my daughter is mixed and so her skin is on the darker side, she came out with the same thing.  The doctor can prescribe something, or if she's too embarrassed, you can try to get her to use Lotrimin.  You can get that at any drug store, it's for jockitch, ringworm, athlete's foot, forms of tinea.  When the doctor prescribed a prescription strength, it took it right away.|`|Gn6EhZXOaa	becky please come back home me and the boys miss you|`|TZW8bIvMaa	Get her to the doctor.

mJFgCvYlaa	Yes, you will definitely lose some weight if you replace soda with water. Half a gallon is a LOT of soda! <br>  <br>  Calculating the calories, it's about 100 calories in 8 oz can of coke, and there's 64 oz in half gallon, which equals to 8 cans... 100 x 8 = 800 calories. <br>  <br>  Typical male's calorie intake is about 2500, so that's about 1/3 of the daily calorie intake for the day!  For females, the calorie intake is about 1900, so the soda's ratio is even higher (42% of your daily calorie intake). By just cutting sodas alone, its like cutting all your food you eat per day in half! And this is a much more effective way to cut your calories than skipping meals.<br>  <br>  I wish you best of luck! Start with baby steps, so you won't give up early on. You might switch to mildly sweet tea, or the flavored water if you're not used to drinking plain water. Once you are cold turkey from soda, you can then move on to the next step such as cutting out candy bars and junk food, and replace them with healthier snacks. Then the third step would be trying some exercises if you can.|`|77b415a109cd2d4e23f60c5ea7484b36aa	<a href="http://www.thedailyplate.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedailyplate.com/</a><br>  You will lose some weight and save your teeth.

Eliminating soda is such a huge step to losing weight. Together with eating healthy and drinking plenty of water, you can lose so much weight. If you find that eliminating soda is hard (as I did) just drink one cup of soda and at least 8 cups of water every day.|`|3WcCeOqdaa	If you drink 1 can of pop per day and suddenly stop drinking that can of pop a day and do NOTHING else, then in a year you will lose 10-15 pounds.  A can of pop/soda (sorry Americans) has 150 calories.  By reducing your caloric intake by that much every day you will start to see results in no time.  And drinking more water is beneficial for weight loss and making your skin appear healthier, etc.|`|Yf5DV9aLaa	yes you definietly will, slowly but you will in the end. good luck, i hate exercising as well so i might do this. water is calorie free, and sugar free, so better for you all round.x

iK3YYRaTaa	Diabetes Type 2:<br>  Type 2 diabetes usually begins gradually and progresses slowly. Symptoms in adults include:<br>  <br>  * Increased fatigue : Due to inefficiency of cell to metabolise glucose, reserve fat of body is metabolised to gain energy. When fat is broken down in the body, it uses more energy as compared to glucose, hence body goes in negative calorie effect, which results in fatigue.<br>  * Polydipsia : As the concentration of glucose increases in the blood, brain receives signal for diluting it and in its counteraction we feel thirsty.<br>  * Polyuria: Increase in urine production is the result seen when excess of glucose is present in body. Body tries to get rid of the extra sugar in the blood by excreting it through the urine. This can also lead to dehydration because excreting the sugar which carries a large amount of water out of the body along with it.<br>  * Polyphegia : The hormone insulin is also responsible for stimulating hunger. In order to cope up with high sugar levels in blood, body produces insulin which leads to increased hunger.<br>  * Weight flactuation : Factors like loss of water (polyuria), glucosuria , metabolism of body fat and protein may lead to loss of weight. Few cases may show weight gain due to increased appetite.<br>  * Blurry vision : Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia nonketotic syndrome is the condition when body fluid is pulled out of tissues including lenses of eye, which affects the ability of lenses to focus resulting in blurry vision.<br>  * Irritability : It is one of the sign of high blood sugar because of the inefficient supply of glucose to brain and other body organs, which makes us feel tired and uneasy.<br>  * Infections : Certain signals from the body is given whenever there is fluctuation of blood sugar (due to suppression of immune system) by frequent infections of fungal or bacterial like skin infection or UTI (urinary tract infection).<br>  * Poor wound healing : High blood sugar resists the flourishing of WBC, (white blood cell) which are responsible for body immune system. When these cells do not function accordingly, wound healing is not at good pace. Secondly, long standing diabetes leads to thickening of blood vessels which may affect proper circulation of blood in different body parts.<br>  <br>  If you was on a low glycemic diet. And exercised everyday. Which means you have not been doing this ,because then you would not be 100 lbs. overweight. You would lose 4 1/2 pounds a week.  and thats walking 2 hours a day.

Numbness.|`|0fe46b4455cf812cd058edb21f73d964aa	Type-II: Nearly 90 per cent of diabetics come under this category. Their bodies produce little or defective insulin. Most of them develop this type of diabetes when they are around 40 to 50 years of age, and if they follow proper diet and exercise, can live on tablets without ever having to take insulin. But usually they don't take it seriously and they end up with insulin sometime in their lives.<br>  <br>  It's also termed maturity-onset diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM. This illness progresses slowly.|`|8c51732b7c8028f90b363e935cfb8e69aa	I hope your not diabetic, its a pain to deal with.<br>  <br>  Increased hunger, unexplained weight loss, frequent urination -- these red flags may indicate early symptoms of diabetes.<br>  <br>  When I found out that I am diabetic I didnt have any of these signs.

RvddYKqjaa	You need to ask a pharmacist about each individual medicine. For some you must have food in your tummy. For others you don't need it, and it's actually not suggested. Some have to be taken an hour before or an hour after meals. Just ask when you get a prescription filled, if the pharmacist doesn't give you a print out. EDIT: Didn't see your additional details. Tylenol has many formulas. Some people get an upset stomach when taking it without food, but most manage just fine without eating. Drink plenty of water with all pills.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	some medicines can be harsh on your stomach if it doesn't have any food in it.  you should probably eat at least a little bit of food before you take any medicine, just to be safe.|`|HOQshwBMaa	It depends on the medecine, however most painkillers will eat away at your liver if you don't eat food with them.

Want your teeth fixed for free?  Enlist in the military.  They will fix them free of charge.|`|NLAek2bJaa	Flossing is the best thing you can do to strengthen your gum tissue. You can not hurt your gums from flossing. Some people say its bad to floss your teeth cause it hurts and bleeds. Well.. thats called bacteria and infected gum tissue. If you floss and it bleeds, bacteria is down under the gums and your body and naturally trying to remove it by bleeding. The more you floss, the less bleeding and pain you will get. Also, the ultimate thing you can do is floss with a knot under the gums. It is painful at first and they will be sore but after the first week of doing it daily, they will not hurt and there will be no bleeding. That is the best recommendations my boss gives to patients. I had really unhealthy gum tissue and I would not floss either. He made me floss for one week with that knot and I will tell it you it HURT. But, after that week, no more bleeding or pain and they were as healthy and strong as can be. Just try it and you will see the difference. This is free advice instead of hitting the dentist office!|`|p5eodXcSaa	Gorilla glue!  Lol!  Buy sensodyne pro enamel toothpaste. And floss everyday. Don't be lazy.|`|hqfH47tHaa	Try chewing Trident...I think they have a special gum out right now that supposed to really strengthen your teeth.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Use Act or Listerine every time you brush and floss.|`|LixIw7bpaa	eating apples are good for your teeth.

It is on manufacturer backorder with no release date.  Basically, for one reason or another, the manufacturers have had to stop producing the drug (many theories as to why), and no date has been given as to when production may resume.  They may have started, they may have not.. no one is for sure.  Percocets are beginning to be difficult for pharmacies to obtain recently as well (as they contain oxycodone), so I am assuming that they are going to be the next shortage.  <br>  I know this because I work in a pharmacy.  I wish I could give you a more hopeful and direct answer, but at the moment this is not a possibility.  All you can really do is hope whatever the problem is gets resolved soon, or get a different prescription from your MD.  Oh, and also your pharmacy cannot call your MD and get a verbal change on a CII Rx as this is illegal.  You will need to get a new handwritten Rx.<br>  Good luck to you.

Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars.

If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women.

dpgXzMenaa	Any  time you want.<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|MHQkgpdqaa	i was 14. <br>  it wasnt to hard. <br>  it hurt at first  but its fine now .<br>   get slim to start off with <br>   be careful of toxic shock you get it fromt hen and you can die<br>   just if you get dizzy or hot flashes take it out and go to doctors !|`|Vf3GJ5GSaa	Me personally i waited til i lost my virginity, but allot of people your age use them.

I made that mistake!|`|RP5NnxgUaa	Really whenever you want. I started trying them out after about my 3rd period, but wasn't succsessful until I had had it for about a year.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	You can use them now!  You are a women, congrats!  What you should do though is go to the store, (with your mom preferably) and find some tampons that are "teen tampons; slight" or "light"  these are little and these are the best ones to get started on because they are little.  Talk to your mom about how to put them in and or read the instructions, it may take a few times to get it right.  Also, don't be afraid to push it up high, it won't get "lost" and the higher it is the more it won't hurt...if it's too low you can feel it and it kind of hurts.  Then you're going to probably still want to wear a pad because these don't have much absorbancy in them, and you can figure out how long you can go without having to change, but this gets you used to wearing them.  Then you can move up to regular or super (or higher if needed)  at no problem!  Congrats!|`|bQCfOftxaa	whenever you want to.  plastic applicators make things easier...and remember if you feel uncomfortable - it's probably not in right, just take it out and try again.  don't get frusturated if you don't get it the first time - it takes a bit to figure out.  but i think you should try them - i just love them - i feel much cleanier and more free to move, also i don't get as bad of cramps if i use tampons (rather than just pads)|`|9iOxl6epaa	i got my period when i was in 5th grade. i started using tampons that day. they are a lot easier, especially in the summer when you go swimming. first try using slimfits or something smaller (not super). also, get some with a plastic applicator. though most tampons come with them. just make sure you double check. <br>  <br>  have funn :]|`|CpevWaQ7aa	There isnt any reason why you should wait.

That doesn't its sellers making such claims, and it doesn't stop the unsubstantiated anecdotes either.<br>  <br>  If this is about someone you know who has leukaemia, please be wary. Wherever there's cancer there's someone willing to part desperate and vulnerable people from their cash in exchange for ineffective and sometimes dangerous 'cures' and 'treatments'.<br>  <br>  The only way Monavie could help someone with cancer is if they enjoyed the taste, in which case it would give them a few moments of pleasure|`|AIjVOdkCaa	The ACAI berry in MonaVie has been shown to destroy leukemia cells, after a study was done at the University of Florida.<br>  No, MonaVie is not a scam.

However, they may never look as small and if they try, they would look emaciated. For instance, a 5ft2 woman with wide hip bones, if she goes less than 36 inches may start to protrude quite badly and her butt may look out of shape. A different person with the same height can have 33 inch hips and still have plenty of fat on them and have a nice round "posterior."<br>  <br>  Women especially should always take their built and frame into account and stick with a weight and size that are proportionate to their frame. A big-boned person should focus on obtaining low body fat even if the result won't appear the same as that of a smaller person. So just don't go overboard, always take your build and frame size into account and stick with a weight and size that you are most comfortable with. In order to determine if you are a large frame or medium frame person, measure your wrist. If it is 7-1/2" around, you are "medium boned." A "a big-boned woman has a wrist that measures about 8".

mJFgCvYlaa	The best approach, I think, is not to think as you're going on a diet, or a try-this-out thing. But, to think this as a lifestyle adjustment, something that you are changing fundamentally to yourself. Since it took some time for your body to get out of shape, it will also take some time to get it back in shape, although most cases it takes shorter time if you stick with it.<br>  <br>  The best recommended exercises to lose fat is ones that works out your cardio, such as running, cycling, rowing, etc. Basically any sport that will make you sweaty and breathe hard, and you can keep doing it will be it. If you don't have a gym membership or done any exercise, try to mix as much exercise in your life as you can. Going shopping? park your car as far as you can, so you can walk longer. Take stairs instead of elevator whenever you can. Eventually try to do some jogging, or whatever exercise you enjoy. What worked for me is bicycling. What really helped me is commuting to work on bike. <br>  <br>  Regarding food, most likely you're getting enough energy, just that you feel tired from sitting all day in an office or school. Once you start exercising, your metabolism will pick up and you'll feel more energetic. On days when I commute, I don't need any coffee at all to stay alert. However, if you started vigorous exercise, you'll need to supply either carbs or protein if you are exercising at that level. Ask Y!A again when you get to that point (or better, a specialist, trainer, nutritionist).<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the larger eyebrows, or what can make the face look more attractive other than losing weight will make your face thinner, and get rid of the chubby chins.|`|v2J0ooWKaa	any sport is good. but keep in mind that if you want to get thinner/fitter you need both weight lifting and aerobic activities. not sure what you should eat though, sorry.|`|k0GTz4hyaa	I would say kickboxing for the sport (burns millions of calories in one session and also works on cardiovascular endurance as well as muscle tone), two bananas gives me enough energy for a 90 minute football match (in conjunction with an energy drink though).<br>  I expect actors look after their appearances more, but I really hate bushy eyebrows hah but that's just me, if they suit you try it.

Give yourself plenty of time to soak the area for twenty minutes or so to soften the hairs, lather up with the quality shave Gel, and be carefull, nicks here can get quite irritated, and be prepared to achieve at least a semierection for ease of task especially near the base. Take your time with the scrotum and be sure to roll the boys around so you expose all the hairs to the razor blade.<br>   Dry off completely and apply a cream called BIKINI ZONE, sold in most drug stores and pharmacies.You may need to reapply each morning for a week or so.|`|DV8AIpjFaa	invest in an epilator.

They are also ordered to determine if a procedure, such as percutaneous coronary intervention – PCI , or a medicine to dissolve the blockage - thrombolytic medicine - has successfully restored blood flow through a blocked coronary artery. Cardiac enzyme studies measure the levels of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase [CPK, CK] and the protein troponin [TnI, TnT] in the blood. Low levels of these enzymes and proteins are normally found in your blood, but if your heart muscle is injured, such as from a heart attack, the enzymes and proteins leak out of damaged heart muscle cells, and their levels in the bloodstream rise. Because some of these enzymes and proteins are also found in other body tissues, their levels in the blood may rise when those other tissues are damaged. Cardiac enzyme studies must always be compared with your symptoms, your physical examination findings, and electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG) results.<br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

IgztWp0uaa	Hi, I just had another repeat a couple of months ago. I was scared too for my first one. Here is what is going to happen...<br>  You are not going to eat the night of or the morning of the procedure. Then you are going to go in and they are going to have you change into a gown, then they are going to put an iv in. Let them know you are really nervous and they might give you a little valium to relax you.<br>  Then you are going to gargle with this really bad tasting stuff  (that is the worst part aside from the IV), then they are going to put some sedative in your iv, it might sting a little, then you will be out like a light!! and will remember nothing. It will be over literally before you even know it, honestly.<br>  After it is over, your throat is going to feel kind of sore. If you feel like you might throw up, or do throw up, make sure they give you something for that (or your parent should anyway).  After the medication wears off, other than a sore throat you should be ok! For your throat try getting some of those glycerine lolipops (not red) and some herbal tea with honey. You can take tylenol, but not Advil to help with any discomfort.<br>  I promise it really will be over before you know it and if you need another one it will not be as stressful as the first time, I promise!<br>  It will be ok, and once you have your diagnosis, it will make your life so much better and you will feel great once you go gluten free! I promise!|`|1gyzz3kxaa	People undergoing the exam in the U.S. typically are sedated with a medication. Medications similar to valium with good amnesia and relaxing effect called midazolam or versed combined with a narcotic like meperidine (demerol) or fentanyl are generally used. More recently a very short acting intravenous sedative, propofol (diprovan), may be administered for deep sedation or an intravenous form of general anesthesia. Occasionally, usually in very young children or people with severe lung problems, general anesthesia is required. The exam is usually not felt or remembered because of the medications.<br>  <br>  Celiac disease affects the upper portion of the small intestine, in the two sections known as the duodenum and jejunum. The examination of the small intestine is usually limited to the first section termed the duodenum though occasionally the second section known as the jejunum may be reached especially when a longer endoscope is used. The resolution of video images are very high with the latest endoscopes and also may have a magnification and color contrast mode to detect very subtle signs of damage of the small intestine.<br>  <br>  The characteristic appearance of the surface of the small intestine in celiac disease include superficial ulcerations that are commonly linear, flattening of the folds, notching or scalloping of the folds and a mosaic like pattern. However, the surface may appear normal and only under microscopic examination of samples will the lining show signs of gluten caused injury.<br>  <br>  Endoscopy can take from 15-30 minutes.  The procedure can take more or less time and varies from person to person.  On average, patients are observed for 30-60 minutes (this can take longer depending on how well the patient is recovering) after their procedure. After you have had something to drink, have been able to sit up, have stable vital signs, and are able to ambulate unassisted, you and your companion will be free to leave. (You cannot leave without an adult to escort you home)<br>  <br>  You can eat and drink normally afterwards, although we recommend starting with a light meal and advancing your diet as tolerated.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	The diagnosis is made by taking a biopsy of your duodenum (small intenstine).  It's a little piece probably the size of your pinky fingernail.<br>  <br>  It'll be quite easy if you're under full, they'll put a camera-tube (endoscope) down your throat, into your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine where they'll do the biopsy.  Should take about 15-30 mins, and usually isn't painful (most adults actually do this while they're awake).<br>  <br>  The biopsy can really prove if you have celiac or not.|`|aa4c3fbc2386cee5e15832eb9767d1beaa	My daughter, who was 3 then, and I each had an endoscopy in 2007.  It was no big deal.  The only thing that upset my daughter was when they tried to give her tylenol after the procedure.  We both ate regular meals later that day.  Neither of us had any problem other than being a little groggy right after the test.

Increase your calories a little though, to about 1500, and also include some strength training.|`|qslROmIMaa	It's possible if you have a good work out plan & your eating, healthy. But, i hate it when people just dont eat, or eat little thats when there body goes into survival mode. So, i say as long as your eating, healthily with a good work out plan. Say, walking 30 minutes (or another type of work out for 30 minutes) a day will be fine.|`|QdtppqFPaa	Yup, my cousin lost 56 pounds in 6 months.  She stopped grabbing snacks at work, stopped drinking soda, and walked every day.|`|83YSCi4Faa	Absolutely possible. Depending on what time you go to sleep, i would say allocate at least 3-4 hours of digestion time before you sleep other than just quit eating at 7. Caloric intake is not much of an issue you can vary anywhere from 1000-2500 calories a day with your exercise and still lose weight. Another thing to try is doing cardio exercises in the morning before you have eaten because you burn strictly fat molecules before you have anything running through your digestive track. Another thing to consider is your water intake, try not to make it a specific number, instead try hydrating when necessary, I tend to drink around 3-4 16 oz. glasses of water a day and eat around 20-50 grams of carbs with exercise and i lost 20 lbs. in only 3 weeks. (I'm 18, 210 lbs, and intake less than 1500 calories a day since 3 weeks ago).|`|v7ZmPEwOaa	Totally, i am in the same boat, need to lose 40 for wedding in september.

4AL6Nj36aa	I don't know why you wouldn't want to brighten up the bottom teeth instead. I do understand that you are concerned with the difference in the overall shades of white but I believe you should consult your dentist and see if there may be a whitening solution for your bottom teeth or an alternative to the lumineers and their shades. Believe it or not, your not alone on this one. But be careful about whitening solutions and teeth bleaching altogether. Good luck to you and I hope that you find the right answer. Katrina:)|`|eyZwqIqsaa	I have veneers as well on the top front. <br>  Unfortunately because they are porcelain, you can not change the shade. <br>  <br>  However, it is very common to have whiter teeth on the top then the bottom.

This encompasses both of the two most common forms of thyroid disease. <br>  <br>  One is called Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimotos gives you hypothyroidism, and it slowly destroys the thyroid by causing inflammation.<br>  <br>  The other is called Grave's disease. Grave's antibodies stimulate your thyroid to product excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, causing hyperthyroidism.<br>  <br>  You should see your doctor, get a full panel of blood tests, and figure out what you have. You need free T3, free T4, and antibodies. Once you figure out what you have, you can be put on meds for it. It is very important to treat whatever thyroid disease yo have, because your thyroid controls your entire body. Untreated thyroid disease can lead to very serious problems.

You mix it and drink it then wait so long before the test. Not sure exactly. I would try and figure out a way to take someones urine in with you. You dont need much and you just have to keep it descrete and warm.|`|KIdUbAheaa	You cant i belive it takes 8 weeks to come out of your system :)
85238f8663a3afab9d258eb0c5ed6a71aa	Yes, that is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  Many of my "less-developed" friends first got their periods from the ages of 10-12. I look more developed than they do, and I got my first period years later than them. Everyone is different--just because your body looks more developed doesn't mean that you will get your period earlier than others. (:<br>  <br>  A girl only needs to worry about her first period if she still hasn't gotten it by age 16. By then, you may want to see a doctor to check if there's something wrong.|`|gF49d7Jcaa	Yep... everyone is different.|`|NNwEuC8paa	yes, everyone is different i got my period early and i still look young and im 20|`|8PqsT1l6aa	don't worry that it is toooooooooo normal.<br>  <br>  it is okay, live happy life, everyone is different.<br>  <br>  if everyone is same no one would be alive.|`|7mLeksI3aa	perfectly normal. everyone is different.|`|VKbtCoejaa	completely normal|`|Plu6OVoGaa	YES!|`|hRqJ7Ii3aa	that is completely normal, everyone gets it at different times and everyone develops at different times<br>  <br>  tell your friend shes fine|`|TFj6Z9Usaa	yea but your friends friend might want to get checked out my a docter. cause periods tell you that your healthy enough to have a child. she may have a desise where she can not have children|`|ZIyZRGftaa	oh yes its completley normal, everyone is different.

Uhh, I am assuming you are female, huh ?|`|AA10350894	A lot of guys can go multiple times! Some may need a few minutes or so to "get back in the swing", while other can just continue on as if they hadn't already had an orgasm. However, It may take longer to reach an orgasm with each consecutive attempt.<br>  There is nothing different or special that you need to do for him to be able to do this, but the more into it that you are the easier it will be for him to continue on.|`|R7zR4aS1aa	Men don't have multiple orgasms the way women think of it,  so there are only two possibilities. First, your boyfriend is young and healthy and can be ready again almost immediately. That is enviable, but not a multiple orgasm. Second, your boyfriend is not really climaxing the first time, but simply releasing fluid. In the first case you don't need to do anything differently, since things are already going great. In the second case he may actually have a problem finishing and need some help from a doctor.|`|9sEM4i5Kaa	I have heard of this before.

Bii5FvqLaa	It may be better to get daily disposables if you don't like the idea of cleaning/ soaking/ disinfecting your contacts every night. However, dailies are usually more expensive. It is true that the longer you wear a pair of contacts the easier it becomes to get an infection, simply because you aren't starting with a fresh, new pair every day. So, daily contacts are easier, but pricier, and monthlies are a hassle but cheaper. It's up to you :)|`|9HPZ6iFyaa	Well, if you want to wear your contacts while you sleep, then I would just go with the monthly ones. But I wear the daily ones where I wear the same pair for a month but i take them in and out before I sleep, it's really no hassle and I chose to wear these ones because I didn't want to get any infections. But i have heard the infections are very rare.|`|nsgeWjspaa	i work in an eye dr office and the Focus night and days are fine as long as you keep them moist and don't try to wear them for 2-3 months change them out every month like you are suppose to.

t81MEJ82aa	Genetics determines how your body stores fat. So you can't pick and choose in what area you would like to gain or lose weight/fat. Also fat and muscle are two completely seperate things, so muscle cannot be turned into fat and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Perhaps gaining weight will make your hips and thighs bigger without adding much weight to the rest of your body, but it's not up to you to choose (not without surgery anyway). If you want a certain part of your body to be more shapely then you'll simply have to work that body part with weights/resistance training. You can target what muscles you want to get bigger, but it doesn't work the same way with fat.|`|BQ1CJGZpaa	u cant turn fat into muscle, they are two different type of tissues. u could tone up the hips and thighs. try jogging and weight lifting.<br>  <br>  don't worry ur not going to get huge muscles|`|pQNwuyuvaa	practically its nt possible to just gain weigh in the areas we wish to ...instead you could consult your local gym instructor ..but again its muscles you will build not weight|`|vEv2YwWdaa	You can not gain weight in one area of your body.  Just go to the gym and work out the areas you want bigger.  The muscle will increase.
rIFqv8nvaa	Spermicidal solution is a very common allergen. It seems both of you are allergic! Throw them away and buy new ones.

Remember not to use any spermicidal products in the future.|`|a1RiSbjTaa	crabs
VM6XG5c3aa	Not a coincidence. Before TSH testing was used they used high cholesterol levels to diagnose hypothyroidism... <br>  <br>  It's important that you take the correct dose of thyroid hormone replacement, if the dose is correct for you, your TSH should remain stable. The fact that it is not suggests that your dose, or choice of hormone replacement, is not correct for your body's needs.<br>  <br>  Though more important than the TSH level is the levels of the thyroid hormones Free T4 and Free T3. TSH is a pituitary hormone, adequate as a general screening to determine thyroid function, but a very poor tool of measurement in adjusting the dosage of replacement hormone.<br>  <br>  It's also important that you take your dose correctly. If you are on a synthetic T4 hormone preparation, like Synthroid, you must take it on an empty stomach (six hours after a meal and one hour before).<br>  <br>  Synthetic T4 requires stomach acid for the first stage of processing, if there is food in the stomach the acid is diluted and other nutrient components (specifically iron and calcium) are likely involved which will bind with the T4 hormone making it unusable by your body.|`|CgF6YYaDaa	There definitely is a connection. The slower your metabolism is, the slower your body works. You need to ask your doctor about using thyroid medication. It will help with your weight, cholesterol, and overall energy level. Good luck.

qKpRCwVXaa	By concreteness I'm assuming you mean tangible or real and as for concealing it the only medicinal advice I can give you is to take some sort of antipsychotic medication, here's a list: <a href="http://www.schizophrenia.com/meds.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.schizophrenia.com/meds.html.</a> Now with schizophrenia three quarters of all patients experience internal or external delusions or paranoia so I would suggest seeing some sort of mental health professional and obtaining a diagnosis before you're symptoms worsen further causing an episode of psychosis. Also, a general way to test whether or not you're having an episode is to have a friend of family member verify if what you're experiencing is real or hallucinatory. Best of luck in your treatment!!!

zFgYaQ5Jaa	In all honesty, its nature. So, if anyone tells you that this is wrong or bad, just ignore them... They let their religion get in their way. <br>  <br>   Now, if you wonder if he's curious there are several ways to do it. The first would be by playing a simple game with him... the game "nervous" is the best game there is to play to figure out if someones ready. You just place your hand on their head and slowly move it down towards other 'areas', and if they want you to shout they'll call nervous, if they don't, they'll let you keep going. <br>  <br>   Though, you might want to make sure what these feelings really are. You may like him, but it may not be as you think it is... take a few deep breaths and simply relax yourself, then think.|`|AA10350894	I am not going to tell you to invite him over for a sleep over and look at some mild porn to see what happens.|`|zEy0uuAFaa	This is normal for young guys like you.  You're just discovering and exploring your sexual feelings, and its natural to explore in all different ways.  You've played around with your own body, it's a natural next step to explore another boy's.  This has nothing to do with whether you're straight or not.  That's something you don't need to figure out just yet.<br>  <br>  Some people can feel threatened by this, so make sure this is a good friend that will forgive you if the idea freaks him out.  If you're getting the vibe that he's interested, he's probably curious too, and you can have some fun together comparing yourselves and teaching each other what you've discovered so far.<br>  <br>  You can bring it up gradually, when you're alone together.  You can start by asking him how big he is, if he gets erections when he doesn't want to, if he masturbates.  Maybe he'll respond and offer to compare erection sizes with you, or he'll be open to masturbating together.  When you start comparing, remember that boys all grow up on different schedules.  If his erection is bigger than yours, or he makes more semen than you, or whatever, it doesn't mean he's "better" or "more manly".  It just means his schedule is different.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	I'm not going to claim expertise on the best method, but I'll give you some suggestions.  The link below might be your best approach.  Contact your local pharmacist and ask them if there is something that they would recommend that is over the counter.  Other things they may suggest include Calamine (which only cools the itch), methyl salicylate compounds (which are anti-inflammatory), lidocaine compounds, menthol, etc.  Since I'm not sure they still offer Piroton tabs in America, I'm not sure what your local pharmacy will have.<br>  <br>  What you are experiencing is the aftermath of damage caused by your immune system.  Much of this damage was likely caused by eosinophiles, which are like the nuclear weapon of the immune system when they get really worked up.  Their job, from an evolutionary standpoint, was to fight relatively massive parasites in the body.  They release powerful digestive enzymes that shred ---- everything.  So, your face wasn't deep fried, technically it was "partially digested."<br>  <br>  There is no fast way to get rid of this.  No miracle is going to help you out aside from providing relief of physical discomfort.  No antihistamines or steroid creams will help you or improve anything at this point.  You have to heal on a cellular level, and that may take a couple weeks based on your description.|`|uZSTgSUcaa	lol man thats funny<br>  yeah it happens all the time.<br>  you need a cortisone cream but i think you cant get that any more<br>  try milk its supposed to be a sooting agent. hope it works i guess?<br>  for you i'd go for natural things and lay off the industrial creams.<br>  and sue olay.|`|CBgDc1Auaa	sweetheart... get yourself an alavera plant... it's a miracle plant... trust...|`|eus7WqzUaa	Dude.

YRJShhKraa	Yes, you are correct that being 15% under your ideal weight is one of the criteria to diagnoses anorexia. However, you don't have to be 15% below your ideal weight to be anorexic, you just have to intentionally starve yourself in order to lose weight. Your ideal weight would be between 108-145.5 pounds. But you don't have to weigh 91.8 pounds or less to be classified as anorexic. Hope this helps! =)|`|gViGPF0Faa	you can still be skinny and not have anorexia.

QfMSJwfDaa	First of all, what you (or anyone else for that matter), should really "want" is fat loss, not weight loss.  Second of all, any safe way of losing fat is going to be at a slow to moderate pace.  The fastest way to lose 20lbs. of weight would be to not eat at all.  But, that's far from safe....  The best way, to lose fat is to adopt a "healthy" diet, and discard all junk food.  In addition to fat loss, a healthy diet will improve the look of your hair, skin, and your overall appearance.  It will also make you feel a lot better.  What constitutes a "healthy" diet?  Well, this is a very controversial subject.  But, based upon my years in experience dieting myself, and observing others, I've found what I believe to be the healthiest diet.  But, I also believe that you should modify the diet (within reason) based on which foods make you feel the best. Everyone is different, and a food that may make one person feel terrific may make another feel miserable....<br>  <br>  Anyway, a healthy diet is one that does not contain any sugar, or processed foods.  Your diet should consist mostly of high fiber vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussel sprouts, salad greens, peppers, sprouts........), lots of good fat (olive oil, nuts, avocado's, and maybe even some real butter every now and then), and a moderate amount (45-60 grams) of protein from good sources, every day.  Some good sources of protein are fatty fish (preferably wild caught), poultry (preferably organic, and free range), game meats (buffalo, venison, cornish game hen....), eggs (algae or flax fed), lowfat dairy (organic, and from grass-fed cows), nuts, seeds, fermented soy products, brewer's yeast, and even sprouted grain products.  Fruit is ok, in moderation, but should not be a staple of your diet.  You should be eating much more vegetables, than fruit.  Also, there are some fruits you should completely avoid, if you want to lose fat (bananas, pineapples, mangos, or any of the high sugar fruits)<br>  <br>  Most people that have problems with their weight, have problems with insulin.  God blessed them with a VERY strong pancreas.  They are the type of people that have "ups and downs" all day long.  They tend to get a burst of energy, shortly after a meal, followed by a big crash.  <br>  <br>  Insulin stores excess energy as fat, and the more insulin you have floating around, the more fat you're going to have.  So, you want to keep your insulin levels low.  The best way to lower insulin is to cut out the foods that are raising your insulin levels, and that is SUGAR!  <br>  <br>  There are only two fuels your body can burn, and that is sugar, or fat.  Ideally, you want to be a good fat burner.  But, unfortunately, most of us have forgot how to burn fat, and are good sugar burners.<br>  <br>  How do you become a good fat burner?  By eating lots of fat, and no sugar, or sugar forming, foods!  Practice makes perfect!<br>  <br>  You should read a book called "The Rosedale Diet."  It would enlighten you....<br>  <br>  Besides diet, exercise is a great way to burn fat.  I would recommend a lot of brisk walking....  At your age, you could just go ride bikes with your friends everyday, or something like that, to get the exercise you need.  Make exercise enjoyable.  Think of things you like to do that requires you to move your body, and DO THEM.|`|Pi8c2pRKaa	Work out.  It's the best way for your age.  Also, do not eat out so much (at least steer clear of fast food) and pick healthier choices to eat.

JwecpnBVaa	Weight is irrelevant to whether a food is healthy or unhealthy, so in this case yes greasy foods will hurt your body, they'll clog your arteries (might not make a difference now but when you are old it will), and it will slow down your system.  Be sure to eat healthy foods that are low fat, not McDonalds types of food.  There is research out right now that eating food high in fat can slow down your brain, which overtime can really hurt you.  Be healthy, if not for yourself for your son because you want him to be healthy and you want to be around for a long time!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	Yes. David Letterman a thin man had SIX (or was it seven?/) clogged arteries bc of his high-fat diet. So, while your body may not use it to store excess fat, it is still being used to give you high blood pressure, cholestertol, etc., over time.<br>  Plus, you may be thin now, but if you eat fastfood continuously, you may not be so thin alter down the road when your metabolism slows. I am not saying this as a curse, I'm underweight too, and ppl have told me the same thing. I know how u feel though---i'm 5'2 and 98 lbs, hate being underweight, and i eat jack in the box almost 3 times a week, which is terrible. but sometimes you gotta eat and run and sometimes the only place for that is fastfood!<br>  But try to eat more healthy snacks like fruits, granola, etc. It will be betetr for your body in the long run.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Yes, it is. My husband is the same way...he can eat all day long and never gain weight.

I have a job where I get to sit around and answer the phone all day and type things in a computer, I thought for sure I would gain weight, but nope.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Yes it is. Regardless of your weight, your body needs certain nutrients, and it also matters what source they come from. Not being fat isn't going to keep someone from having high cholesterol or blood pressure.

IcAO0QuBaa	You should ask the doctor that's a great question that all women on birth control should be asking.|`|9Eebavmiaa	?Never heard of this?

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	If IBS is impeding on your life you need to see your Doctor to sort out proper management. Try increasing more fibre in your diet- this works for 50% of people, but 50% of people also find this makes the problem worse. This is also more of a long term measure.<br>  <br>  The first line drug for management of IBS is Colpermin. If this does not work, you could try an antispasmodic drug or Amitriptyline which acts as a smoother, lessening the spams. I am not sure anything you do now is going to help for tomorrow. The only thing I can suggest is that you avoid all provocative foods beforehand. <br>  <br>  If you go out, make sure you are aware beforehand where the toilets are if you should need to use them.|`|ajPHMliqaa	try cutting out dairy ie milk.........and get some acidophillus capsules from Holland and Barrett..........it improved things for me 100%
o37i9Nazaa	I have ibs too but i learned that the worst thing that you can do in a situation like yours is worry! It tightens up your bowl muscles which gives you pain because there is a major connection of nerves from your brain to your tummy/bowles which increases the pain by a lot.<br>  Theres nothing to worry about! Theres toilets there and im sure if anything happens youll get there in time queue or not! Think about it, if you go out there worring incase your not going to feel well then your not going to feel well. <br>  Just relax and have fun and it will be over before you know it. And if the medication isnt working then I would go and see your local doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ISWNzJwFaa	Sounds intresting I looked IBS up and from what ive found so far it sounds in reach of cure whether people wanna believe it or not.<br>  <br>  ok, first of all i have little experience in this field of study but i have researched alot on hamsters, guinea pigs and other small animals that are simular and theres a very common illness called wet tail. Its to most popular causes are poor diet and stress. The symptoms of this illness are very very simular to those of IBS and the substance used to cure this if noticed in time is a substance called neomycin sulfate and is usually dilluted with water. DO NOT DRINK THIS ..... it can cause respitory failure. Also im pretty sure its neomycin sulfate that is sometimes used in transplants to reduce the bodys reaction to the foreign tissue untill it has time to get used to it. Therefore the cure probably lies withing the comparrison of wet tail and IBS.<br>  <br>  so yea .... my best advice is look at your diet list some foods youve eaten or what youve drank and try limiting it to less food variety and write down what youve eaten on a bad day then experiment and try elliminating all but one so in end it could just be diet and secoundly limit your stress as much as possible ..... plan a schedual out and try as much as you can to stick to it like a bed time and get up time and a rest time during the day where you just take 15 mins and rest let anything go through your mind and if something stressfull pops into your head assume  that its something unstressfull and also plan your diet like this to the whole 3 meals a day thing at a certin time your body will function better in some area if you follow guidelines like this ....... its funny how much ive improved all over in following these things. i used to have really really dry skin and dandruff i was embarresed to do anything i hated my job i was always tired or feeling sick and weak having insomnia but then i did similar things to what i just said and its weird .... skins cleared up tons, i can concentrate way better and am not weak all the time i can enjoy life tons better<br>  <br>  how i did it .... made a schedual and stuck to it, quit my job and got a new one that i enjoy, viewed evrything stressfull event to come as something that im looking forward to regardless of how badly i know its gonna suck, taken brakes and thought the way i told you, and just faced it .... if people are gonna laugh at me or think it was nasty that my skin was dry to hell with them and true friends are all you need and if their true it wont matter<br>  <br>  so yea to me IBS sounds like a stress related problem sometimes the body just needs to rest and adjust so it can replenish itself properly.|`|DAwEx4Egaa	If you're a beer drinker, try switching to something else. There are many conditions that get misdiagnosed as IBS that are triggered by food - especially wheat products. I've also heard from several physicians that IBS is just a name that is slapped on any intestinal condition that they can't identify. You may have another condition like Celiac Disease, Gluten Intolerance, or Chrohns - only your doctor can tell. Some of these can be diagnosed with a simple blood test. If your doctor won't do further testing to get a real answer for you, it may be time to switch doctors.|`|qzCALgT7aa	I suffer the same problem and I think that your trouble is the same as mine, as in it is mostly in your head and worrying about it turns you into a wreck.

GnjhUg9baa	Emo stands for emotional. What you said indicates that you have emotional problems. What this is related to is most likely physical or sexual abuse. Your cutting yourself and wanting to hurt yourself points to a history of actually being hurt. Being EMO is certainly trendy now. EMO grew out of the punk and goth scene. It is a popular trend. But in psychiatry your behaviors would be considered maladaptive coping skills aimed at trying to manage unpleasant emotions and situations. Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen were emotional punks ( sid n nancy) but look at there life story and examine the problems they had. And how ultimately ( though glorified and romantacized ) their behaviors were self injurious and extreme expressions of emotional pain, often these feelings are linked to physical and sexual abuse. So examine your past, and understand your coping mechanisms. Dont just label yourself an EMO ( emotional ) person. At least not if when you get out of high school and the temporary trends and pop(ular) culture are not going to be productive in making you the person you want to be.|`|D5bjv9qvaa	I wouldn't call you emo, but you are self harming - which is not good.

Each type is distinctly identifiable by its specific protein coating that cause a number of illnesses including - typhoid fever, food poisoning, gastroenteritis and enteric fever, from contaminated food products. Salmonellosis is spread to people by ingestion of Salmonella bacteria. Salmonella is worldwide and can contaminate almost any food type, but most commonly, outbreaks of the disease involve raw eggs, egg products, fresh vegetables, cereal, and contaminated water.

JwecpnBVaa	Yes thats wonderful, make sure that the green tea you are drinking is the kind you make yourself with the tea bags, its the best kind for you.  also try other teas like black tea and wu tea, they're both really delicious varieties.  Be sure to add in some carrot or celery sticks, an apple, and some other kind of fruits and veggies throughout the day just to keep your body functioning well and have all its vitamins.<br>  <br>  Instead of tomato soup try something that is more water based with veggies in it.<br>  <br>  Also be sure that you are exercising some every day, at least 20 to 30 minutes!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	That sounds like anorexia unless you are planning on having something else for dinner.<br>  <br>  By the way, as for cutting carbs, you don't have to cut all of them.  Just get rid of the purified, processed sugars like fructose and sucrose, and you'll be fine (Fructose in actual fruit is okay).  Glucose-rich foods like pasta and bread are supposed to be the carbohydrate source for humans, and are perfectly healthy to eat (more healthy to eat them than to avoid them, in fact).  This all has to do with how your liver handles large amounts of fructose and sucrose (like from soda) vs. large amounts of glucose (like from grains).  It's complicated, but just know that higher proportions of the large amounts of fructose and sucrose get metabolized into fat much, much more than large amounts of glucose.  To make it even clearer, just imagine corn syrup and table sugar as being equivalent to a saturated fat source, like butter, and you'll get the idea.|`|u5MMhrfOaa	I will have to agree with liason. you are definitely off to a good start. i'm on a bit of a diet myself.

You could use some green veggies though. <br>  I don't recommend anyone eating the same food everyday, but your approach is pretty good: cereal for your fiber and keep you filled. Soup is also another filler that has low calories, and lots of water and green tea is very good too (hopefully not too sugary, plain would be even better).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about cutting out the carbs, since you are exercising you need some carbs to replace the glycogen burned while exercising. When you add just the right amount of carbs, you keep your body burning fat and the carbs to restore the glycogen in your muscles. So, I would recommend adding some whole grain bread on days when you exercise, or brown rice, or any whole grains you can think of.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	this isn't a good diet.  there are zero fresh vegges in here.  you are off to the right start.  make sure the green tea is diet.  otherwide, the sugar will add a lot of calories.

It's healthier and easier on your body. You want to make sure that you have an all around diet with plenty of carbs, protein, and fat. It simply matters the source that the food is coming from. Calories don't matter as much as people think. You want to stick to foods that provide at least decent nutritional value. So for example, a person is going to better off eating 2000 calories worth of brown rice, veggies, fruits, and lean meat vs. someone eating 2000 calories of fatty meat, candy, doughnuts, etc. All calories are not equal. <br>  <br>  Plus you want spread your calories out and not eat them all in 2 or 3 meals. 3 meals + 2-3 snacks eating every 2-4 hours will keep your metabolism active.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

They were generally ingrown hairs. I don't shave any more and use a depilatory cream instead which is much kinder to my skin. Although I still have a lump sometimes it's very rare now. Some people like myself (and possibly you as well) are more prone to have these lumps.<br>  I do hope your problem is nothing to worry about but I would recommend for your own peace of mind to visit your doctor and have it checked.<br>  Best of luck! :-)

wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers!

ebQJsYTxaa	The chickenpox vaccine does not prevent shingles.  But you cannot get shingles from anybody else.  You can only get chickenpox from someone with shingles, if you are not immune to chickenpox.|`|eodAuMg3aa	No.  The chickenpox vaccine does not prevent Shingles.  Just so you know, and contrary to popular belief Shingles is not contagious.  You would have to inhale the secretions of the actual lesions in order to get shingles.  HOWEVER, someone who has shingles should not be in contact with anyone who has not had chickenpox. For example, If someone has not had chickenpox, they can get chickenpox from being exposed to someone with shingles.  I hope this helps you.

tGEMwgyBaa	If you are on welfare, then you are assigned a dental office to go to. If it is not in your area, welfare has a list that shows the dentists in your surrounding area. As for transportation, try the bus or taxi, friend or family member, some dental offices have transportation services for you. You have to find a way to go to the dentist no matter what, if you don't go, you will get an infection that will end up in your blood stream and then your in big trouble. I work in a dental office and I have seen people that have come in with their faces swollen and their necks swollen from infection. These patients were referred to the ER. You must find a way to take care of this. In the mean time, and I don't normally suggest this but it sounds like you don't have much money, if you have a candle, take some of the wax and fill in the hole or cover the open portion of the tooth so no food, liquid or air can reach the nerve. This is only a temporary fix, you need to go to the dentist. Good Luck!|`|NtAuguxEaa	I think the best thing to do is to save up the money to get it removed. On many occasions people have pulled out a tooth, and then the gum gets infected which spreads to the other teeth, and then it spreads across your face resulting in having half a swollen face. Then you'd have to pay for antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Hope the pain goes away :)|`|RUVfiy3zaa	Take a glass of little hot water and add one or one and half teaspoon of salt, and gargle.|`|NmOQy10saa	Maybe try your local public health office or welfare. If you dont have a job you may qualify for some assistance.|`|3KyVMVncaa	I am so sorry to hear you have tooth pain. An extraction usually costs around $200. Call your dentist and ask if you could do a payment plan. As long as you are paying on your bill it should be fine. If you are up front and honest about your money issues I'm sure they would be willing to work with you. DO NOT take a tooth out yourself. That is VERY dangerous to do! I also wouldn't go to the ER because of the high cost. Trust me, give a call to the dentist and talk to them. Good Luck and I hope you feel better.
s9Pwnb87aa	No, not unless it has been bored out and beefed up.
ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	GERD and acid reflux are the same things, and you described having reflux - which is the vomit that gets into your throat.  Problems caused by acid reflux wouldn't necessarily show up with an endoscope, so a negative endoscope finding only means that you do not have enough reflux to cause inflammation of the esophagus.   <br>  <br>  The best thing to do in your situation is to make sure you have at least 3-4 hours between eating dinner and going to bed, and eliminate things from your diet that seem to aggravate the problem.  Medications like PepsidAC or Roalids may also help.  <br>  <br>  Blood in the stool, if it looks like fresh, red blood is caused by hemorrhoidal bleeding.|`|BJuHbQXfaa	Instead of GERD could it be acid reflux. Because the symptoms that you describe are the same symptoms that I had and I was diagnosed with acid reflux and the doctor put me on Nexium and ever since then I have not had a problem. Acid reflux can also cause all the heartburn and worse. If I were you I would change doctors and get another opinion, because I know how painful this can be. I hope this helped. Good Luck!
LiJ5TQJraa	Go to Sally's Beauty Supply and get a tool called an 'extractor'<br>  <br>  It's a little metal 'stick' looking tool with an open hole at the end. <br>  You can use this to extract the blackheads just like a skin care specialist would if you were getting a professional facial. <br>  <br>  You can give yourself a facial at home like this....<br>  <br>  1.) cleanse your face with an exfoliating cleanser suited for your skin type.<br>  <br>  2.) then use a toner on your face (I use witch hazel toner, its all natural, comes in a giant bottle and lasts forever and is cheap too)<br>  <br>  3.) Then boil a large pot of water until it starts steaming. Get a large towel and hold it over your head while your face is in the steam. Steam your face for about 3-5min. be sure not to burn yourself. you may want to turn the heat down on the stove while your face is under the towel.<br>  <br>  4.) sterlize your extractor with alcohol.<br>  <br>  5.) begin extracting the blackheads. (go to youtube.com and search "How to do facial extractions" be sure to to do it correctly or you may clog your pores and make it worse. Doing extractions does take a bit of practice, but its not too hard.<br>  <br>  6.) after extractions, wet a small hand towel with very cold water, and lay it on your face where you have had extracts, this will help with the redness.<br>  <br>  7.) apply toner again, and follow with a facial lotion for your skin type.<br>  <br>  You can repeat this process every week to week and a half. Remember to wash your face 2x a day, morning and night. Use cleanser, then toner, then facial lotion.|`|Zt6eh6VRaa	The blackheads on your nose are probably sebaceous filaments - they look just like blackheads but are just oil glands and will never go away. Everybody's got them and it is normal to have them. There's nothing to do for them. Even if you extract them they will look the same and will just fill up again right away. <br>  <br>  If you are comparing yourself to pictures in fashion magazines, you are looking at pictures that are airbrushed and are NOT real. Real people have pores.<br>  <br>  Step away from the magnifying mirror.......

Rq1odpuzaa	Calories is a major topic when it comes to weight loss. We need to understand three things: the amount of calories in our food, the amount of calories a certain physical action uses up every 60 minutes, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories. The only thing that definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost twenty five pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|fLKvHHtsaa	2K|`|g2h6qUUXaa	you need at least 1200-1500 calories a day|`|gF49d7Jcaa	2000<br>  So 1990

zEy0uuAFaa	You don't need to worry just yet.  Two things you should know:<br>  <br>  One - In boys, it's normal for the inside of the foreskin to be attached to the glans (what you called the "bell end").  These two parts separate as you grow older, but sometimes they may remain partially attached until age 17 or so.  If your foreskin is still attached, don't try to force it, let it grow apart normally as you get older.  If it is still firmly attached when you reach age 17 or more, you can see a doctor to separate it, but don't let him talk you into a circumcision.  You don't have to throw away your foreskin just because it's stuck to your glans.<br>  <br>  Two - It's possible that your foreskin is actually completely free of your glans, but you think it's attached because the opening in the end isn't stretching enough.  You can help this along by stretching it yourself, gently, with your fingers, until it learns to open wide and fold back and forth naturally.  I'm attaching a link to a webpage that has a number of exercises you can try.<br>  <br>  So, at 13 - don't worry.  This is probably perfectly normal, and you'll grow out of it.  Just practice stretching your foreskin, and be patient.  You have plenty of time.|`|ajPHMliqaa	see a doctor who will give u some cream and instructions on how to proceed...only get circumcised as a last resort|`|i6RlYFo7aa	i don't quite understand your question but<br>  as long as it goes back it's fine<br>  my skin doesn't go past the ridge either<br>  <br>  and if you meant it was tight around the whole head then look up foreskin stretching excercises on yahoo or google|`|UfisV9bEaa	if you go to the doctors you can get a cream that you can rub in to make the skin more elastic, but it is painful because you need to pull it back and it will hurt.<br>  <br>  or for the next week have a hot bath and then peel it back it will hurt you need to do it a lot.<br>  <br>  if this does not work then you will need to have it removed. don't worry lots of people get it. i9 have an uncle that had to have it removed.|`|kUod9ScBaa	Dude, don't worry about it at all!!

I am 7.4 inches erect and I just turned 15 last month, and my girlfriend is very pleased with my size. and besides, if you have foreskin, that enables your penis to grow longer then someone who does not have extra skin! You don't need to see a doctor unless you have pain or something, and I know how embarrassing it can be to tell your doctor/parents that you want them to look at your penis. <br>  <br>   Just be happy with who you are, you're fine the way you are.

You also don't need to but any cream or products. It's PERFECTLY NORMAL. <br>  <br>  Over time, you will be able to pull the foreskin right back. But there is no need to force it at your age. It is of course natural that you maybe think you're somehow different from other guys or whatever because the foreskin can't be pulled back all the way, but eventually it will.<br>  <br>  Just, in terms of general advice, I would recommend that you pay particular attention to Hygiene down in that area. Make sure, that you're washing yourself properly in the shower ect. Also every now and then, try and pull back the foreskin a little. By doing this now and again, you'll free up the skin that's attached. Eventually, the skin will contract all the way.|`|bNbwtQhaaa	you need to stertch your foreskin. i had this problem.

RluCMVUSaa	Yes it is caused by this and if I hit you on the back while you are making a face it will stick... no it is caused by your hormone levels and regardless those would fluctuate at your age... masturbation has nothing to do with it at all and hair loss due to testosterone is age related and called hereditary hair loss so if it runs in the family for premature balding that is the likely cause, your hair would also bald in a pattern google male pattern baldness... you know the flip side of this would be my stepmother who always told my brother that if he would get out and get some that his acne would be cleared... yes you should look into the hair loss and order something for your face, but playing with your pecker isn't the source of your woes, even if you are catholic.|`|AA11785060	Not true at all, and has been proven scientifically to be false.

You can keep it up and don't feel like your are going to go bald, go blind, get acne, or go insane. They used to say that to keep us guys from enjoying ourselves. Don't believe it.<br>  <br>  Your body will create whatever hormones it is going to create and that's it. <br>  <br>  I'm bald, and my brother has a full head of hair. We both masterbated like crazy in our teens. He had acne, I didn't. Go figure. More likely, heredity and diet had more effect than pleasuring ourselves.<br>  <br>  Keep asking questions and don't listen to old wives tales.
j6NULSo6aa	your still young ......the oldest u should be without boobs and period is 16.Trust me im 14 and in 8th grade and i got my boobs in 5th grade and now their huge! take some of mine if you want lol!|`|77NzfiVkaa	You probably don't have it because you are way to skinny!! That will stop your period from happening. If you haven't started by the time you are 16 you need to see a doctor. And gain some weight!!!|`|QJHE3z1raa	you have to be like 100 pounds to get a period<br>  Your clearly underweight which is slowing down the process|`|UADLdXBtaa	You definitely don't have to worry. When I was in HS a girl I knew was a tall skinny boobless lightweight and then when she was 17.. yeah 17! she finally got both her period AND boobs. Puberty is a strange thing and it happens at different times for everyone. For now I would just say enjoy the time you have left because bras are uncomfortable and when I was younger the cramps that came with my period were the WORST pain I have ever felt in my life. I wish I didn't have to have a period and if I wasn't planning on having children someday I would probably voluntarily have a hysterectomy.|`|ujomB7iHaa	don't worry! im 80 pounds and in the 9th grade too. i don't have boobs yet either and i just got my period-it will happen,but i've been told that being thin does have something to do with it and i think why is it just my that doesn't have boobs(im sure you feel the same way) but it will happen,don't worry|`|yyIVrngcaa	wow...you're probably a late bloomer, and very underweight..try going to see your doctor and getting a physical..see what he has to say about your health..<br>  <br>  I was also thin in 9th grade, maybe 95-105 pounds...only til now have i ganied weight..most likely cuz im on the pill...|`|3NAwWRMyaa	74 pounds?!?!?! wow. Anyway, It's not uncommon for girls not to have their period in 9th grade. It's not average but it's not bad. Some girls are just later. Boobs will come with your period most likely.|`|GaOcJOgzaa	Hey I am the exact same way, but I actually weigh 93 pounds. You need to talk to a doctor. I have small boobs and I don't have my period also, but its cause I am skinny. That is the same way with you. Just try to gain some weight (talk to a doctor about it) and then that may help a little.|`|v2rmZu2aaa	Your weight is not normal,.. 74 pounds would be underweight for a 7th grader probably. You dont have your period yet because your tiny. Girls with bigger boobs usually get it earlier then later. Talk to your mom or sister or someone about this. You should get your period by the age of sixteen. If not.. see a doctor|`|7xc8jgLXaa	yes you will get both in time. Some girls don't get their periods until they are 16 or 17. As for your boobs, they will develop when they are meant to (i know you probably don't like that answer lol but it's true).<br>  <br>  Your body just isn't through developing yet...you'll get them =)<br>  <br>  oh and i agree with the other answers...you need to gain some weight so your development can continue|`|qaWtwRGpaa	its not about weght.. well yea.. but u dont need to eat u need to work out and gain muscle.. thats all.... i got my period on the last week of freshmen year... and my boobs grew that summer and i grew 4 more inches in the past 10 months i was 4:11 also!  and after that i feel perfectly normal.. i stopped worrying about what i look like......|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Yeah eventually, It's probably because of your weight. You normally don't get your period until your around 100 lbs. Have fun while you don't have your period it sucks alot.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	You're lucky you don't get your period!|`|h1e6TvFpaa	you need to seriously gain weight and then you will|`|YDB8kpUAaa	How tall are you? If you're really short, like 4 foot or something, then don't worry about it, that's the right weight.<br>  However, if you're not, that's like anerexic model skinny. Get some help, gain some weight.<br>  Try to gain weight until you're about 100 pounds, more or less. That'll be a big improvement.<br>  You're period isn't there because you're too skinny. And you don't have any breasts because there isn't anything to work with! When you can see your bones jutting out, don't expect to see anything much there. As a reference, look at these models. <br>  <a href="http://maremare1225.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/skinny.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://maremare1225.files.wordpress.com/...</a><br>  Does it look like she has anything? No.<br>  Good luck eating junk food~!|`|bgOyAbPFaa	hmm<br>  you should health up<br>  i'm sure thats the problem<br>  or maybe ur just maturing later instead of earlier<br>  L=/<br>  <br>  try herbalife<br>  =]<br>  its really good<br>  its not a chemical or anything!!!<br>  its kinda like<br>  bare minerals for makeup<br>  i dont kno much about bare minerals<br>  but i hear its really good<br>  like natural-wise<br>  <br>  but anyways<br>  herbalife is like a multi vitamin<br>  but for Everything!!!<br>  x]<br>  find someone who sells it<br>  and they'll tell you all about it<br>  <br>  my roommate got into it<br>  and i was like<br>  omg shes just gonna get ripped off<br>  or something<br>  cuz it was like<br>  "u can loose weight!"<br>  but she made me take it for a while<br>  and omg<br>  i felt like super amazing<br>  x3<br>  ok ok<br>  i dont wanna sound cheezy<br>  but herbalife is super when it comes to getting ur health back good<br>  xD<br>  hahaha<br>  its ferreals<br>  x]|`|CPObbqfsaa	dont worry! I always wanted to look older when I was in high school, I developed late... like I grew 6 inches my senior year and gained 30 lbs.. now everyone else my age is jealous because i look young! <br>  Don't worry its natural, when your young everyone wants to look old, and when your old everyone wants to look young! <br>  <br>  Stay healthy!|`|AA11952457	Hey I didn't get my period until the summer of my junior year and my boobs weren't even fully developed till after i graduated. I am pretty skinny too. You have nothing to worry about, trust me.|`|AUo4IGyIaa	Dont worry . . . . your just like me . . . i have no boobs or my period and im skinny. my mom didnt get her period till she was 16. im just like her. dont worry . . your not alone.|`|pD3x19k5aa	I didn't get my period until I was almost in 10th grade and I still have an A cup and I'm in college. It might be partially because of your weight, I was 115 lbs and 5'4'' in 9th grade.|`|ZWsCHjIKaa	you r wayyyy under weight for your age... might have a medical problem.. see a doctor!!
LiJ5TQJraa	Is it ON your ACTUAL ear lobe on BEHIND IT on your neck under the skin by the throat?<br>  <br>  If its is under your ear by the throat, it would be a swollen lymph node thats swollen due to an on-coming cold/flu infection. If it continues, see a Dr. you may have an ear infection, or some kind of lymphatic infection. (this has happened to me a lot)<br>  <br>  If it is a lump ON the EAR itself, it may be a zit inside the skin of the ear forming,(this is common) or it could be a non-cancerous cyst. ( I have one of these of my legs) If its not a zit and does not go away, have a dr.or dermatologist/skin care specialisit look at it to make sure its not harmful.|`|xEBP3Kobaa	It could be just loose skin or it could be serious like a Tumer. just the doctor will no.
okzg0pVsaa	first of all- its obvious that you really care about your "girlfriend" because if you didn't you wouldn't be so worried about "cheating" on her. honestly, there aren't alot of guys out there like that! but i just think that you are young and you don't know what you want. I think the feeling of being with her to you is comfortable and its, easy, in a way. You just need to follow your heart and do what you think its right! As clich'e as it sounds, whats meant to be will always find its way. I hope everything works out for you!|`|Fq8yzJamaa	Your just young ... give yourself time to really explore who you are and what you like ... WITHOUT hurting girls in the process. It sounds like you can be a good friend but beyond that you have a lot to learn about yourself. Save them from yourself ... or you really will have A LOT to feel guilty about in the end.|`|JmNaXTjqaa	sounds to me that maybe your girlfriend isnt the one other wise yu wouldnt be thinking about all the other girls because you would be happy with who you are with. i would end it with your current girlfriend before you do somthing silly like cheat or youget to serious again.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|UhbyuzuXaa	I am married and I never think about other women specially Ex's (that's why they are Ex's) why even hang out with a woman when your comparing her to others ... that's just sad ... I feel sorry for any girl you date.
KolPO87Raa	You didn't mention your height and weight. THC stores in fat cells, and can take up to 30 days to be metabolized. The key word in the above is metabolized. You might test clean by then, but you may want to increase your exercise. The more aerobic exercise you do, the more fat you will burn, thus flushing out some THC. Remember to stay very well hydrated as that will flush out the THC, but only after it has been metabolized. Water alone will not work. Don't try to cheat the test, as most labs that do drug tests are hip to the cheats. In the end it's better to explain a once in a blue moon hit on a joint at a party, than getting caught as a cheat and a liar. Good Luck!|`|LixIw7bpaa	You should. However I would keep drinking TONS AND TONS of water. It will help you get it out of your system faster.|`|c571qVXTaa	Ok, it all depends on how much you smoked 3 weeks ago and how much fat you have on your body. If that was a joint you just randomly puffed for the hell of it and the only one youve had in a while, youll definitely pass. But if you smoked daily and you have a good bit of body fat, chances are youll fail. THC stores in your fat cells and the more fat cells you have, the more THC your body absorbs.|`|EuD4pX0saa	some people says that weed stays in your blood 30 days, but i hope you can pass. good luck
ReaD6u4paa	he is brain is not swelling...he has edema in his brain.as the pressure builds up on the brain..it will stop some of its functions until your uncle dies.<br>  i am sorry for him.i dont know if he will make it.only a neurosurgeon can tell|`|6cwJi5kxaa	it depends. you can get very ill, become retarded if you live or chances are death|`|xI5FyAQDaa	I apologize, I do not have an answer but I just wanted to say Good Luck and I'm sure he will get better. I will pray for you and your uncle.
ReaD6u4paa	yes some people are allergic to amoxillin.you should contact your doctor
FioGtH1qaa	i had an ankle break with ligement repair and was in cast for 6 weeks after cast came off it took about 7 weeks before the swelling went completely down, im sorry if u already are but make sure u keep ur leg elevated at all times, i dont no anyhting about medication for swelling so i would see a doctor, it is worst when your on crutches as u probably no because the cast feels so tite with the swelling, make sure u dont start walking on it to soon like i did. When u are out of cast walk on ur ankle with as much pressure as u can mange using the two crutches then as it gets easier use 1 crutch and u should be walking fine with no swelling. Hope this helps.
aGXankr2aa	One word of warning, the THC can remain in your hair folicles for up to 6 months, so unless you have all-over alopecia, you're in trouble.  Quick question, is smoking a little blow worth going back inside for?|`|tqfkHiEQaa	I'm guessing that the drug use has something to do with you being on probation?... just a guess|`|5nYC6RM1aa	Don't do it...it's not worth it. Just wait until you're off probation. And just to let you know, they take samples from your hair now..not your urine.|`|DuSvfGDLaa	drinking water doesnt work i mean it helps but its not very effective look at the athletes they drink a lot of water but they still fail tests they sell pills that get toxons out of your system in 3-5 days thats prob the fastest way its quite expensive though and they have drinks that are like 60 bucks that get rid of it in 5 hours but they drink wears off after a few days and you can fail a test|`|MiKrWuM6aa	It stays in your hair for up to a year... HA!|`|gPYTkIW2aa	pee alot|`|ICGxM45qaa	You could drink a LOT of water the day before and the day of your test (I'm talking gallons), and when you piss... only use the middle of the stream. What I mean by that is you piss for a second, then start taking the sample, then piss the rest into the toilet/urinal. Any head shop will also sell drinks to clean out your system. The day before don't eat any fatty or greasy foods. Also, don't do any strenuous exercise before you go, as the reason it stays in your system for 1 - 4 weeks (depending on how often you smoke) is that it gets stored in your fat cells (though if you drink enough water your piss would get diluted enough anyway, but why take chances). You can also buy an at-home drug test (costs about $12 at the head shop I used to go to back when I used to smoke) to test yourself right before you go, so you know what to expect when you get there, or so you can find some valid excuse (like breaking your leg ;-) ) ... though if you DO test positive at home, when you go in just tell them up front that you smoked a little weed. Depending on where you live and what you're on probation for, they might not even care (as was the case with my sister's boyfriend)... they're usually looking for real drugs anyway, unless they just want an excuse to violate you.<br>  <br>  Edit: For those idiots that are talking about hair tests... they don't use them for probation violation for the simple fact that it does stay in your hair for a long time, so they wouldn't be able to tell if you had smoked it before you were ever on probation. You only need to worry about that for jobs that use it for employment drug tests.|`|M2uOF5ZEaa	? . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .<br>  <br>  there is no quicker way|`|n6IBfiDPaa	I've heard drinking a lot of pickle juice does it!<br>  But i dont smoke lol so I dunno<br>  <br>  But thats what my brother used to do!

If its 1 day out of the month and you know what day that is, you might be able to do it. The amount of time THC stays in your body is different for everyone. THC stores in your fat cells and the more fat you have, the more THC your body absorbs. Also upping your metabolism helps to rid the body of THC. SO, if you dont have a lot of body fat and stay pretty active AND you only have to take 1 test a month::: Smoke up to 3 days after the test, then spend the rest of the month sober, active, and drink lots of liquids. Youll glide by everytime.|`|dltzzsCraa	There isn't. The probation department isn't going to warn you either before they test you, and weed stays in your system the longest, sometimes taking more than 4 weeks before it stops showing up in UAs. <br>  You had better stay away from it alltogether, trust me. there are some people who just do without it for their length of probation, then i've seen people who refuse to do that and they can be dealing with warrants, re-arrests, court dates, and fines out their ears for 10+ extra years. <br>  I would suggest that if you have trouble stopping start going to NA (Narcotics Anonymous) meetings. Nothing good will come of smoking weed i promise you that.<br>  <br>  Edit: some people are talking about flushing your system, but just from personal experience i will tell you that if you urine is too clear and they suspected you tried to flush you system they will make you wait and pee again and count it as invalid.|`|CV3zj19Kaa	Dude!! Ya gotta go to the store buy Cran juice.. like two giant bottles and just chug the hell out of them..

Good luck -TyE|`|AA11672059	nope. it can stay with you up for 6 months to a year so they with know when you smoke. so the safes way DONT DO DRUGS. and there are other ways they can tell peeing does don help and drinking liquids wont help either.... and there is no magic pill that with take it all away|`|kvIDcbBiaa	It depends on how often you smoke weed.  The more you smoke, the longer it stays in your system.  And it also depends on what type of test your giving.  They have system flushers @ GNC, but who knows if those really work.|`|f882f4264999880641cf3961bd3a845eaa	on the day you're gonna be tested, drink 8 glasses of water and take a vitamin C.
