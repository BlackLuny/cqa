20090226193757AA9cIyf	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Do "Enriched" vitamins and minerals benefit you?	Well, I'm tired of getting 2 sided answers.      My health teacher says "Enriched/Fortified vitamins and minerals do not help you at all! Your liver does not know what kind of enzyme to make to break down that synthetic molecule. It is like some kind of foreign invader and the liver has no clue what to do. The vitamins/minerals go right through your system and DON'T DO ANYTHING! For example fortified bread, grains, and cereal. Those fake molecules are useless."      My food/nutrition teacher is all about fortified/enriched foods. "Fortified/enriched foods is a great and better way to get more nutrition. Fortified bread is a lot better than non-fortified bread. EAT MORE FORTIFIED/ENRICHED FOODS!"      I'm really stuck because they both sound convincing. Can someone tell me, do the synthetic vitamins and minerals get in your body? I NEED EVIDENCE PLEASE!

I've been a bartender through college and now I'm 23. I tend not to drink anymore. Nothing against it, It's just not for me anymore. When I do drink I feel the immediate urge to go drop one off at the pool, I think it's odd. It's nothing bad like diarrhea, it's just a small feeling. Anyone else have this feeling? I mostly notice it when I'm drinking at home which tends to be straight liquor, Cognac and brandy mostly. If i'm out at a bar or something (in a drinking mood) i usually don't notice it.

20090226212105AA7KkgA	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Would you go eat a restaraunt to eat meatloaf?	I saw a movie where a guy was eating a meal with meatloaf, mashed potatoes and vegetables and I don't get it because I would never go eat at a restaurant by myself just to have a meatloaf meal.  I mean to me that's just so lame.  I realize he may of did it because it looked like he finished work late because he was wearing a suit with a tie.  So he decided to eat somewhere before he went home because by time he would get home and cooked something himself it would be much later, 1981 was before tv dinners I guess.  I guess he possibly chose the meat loaf meal because it was the cheapest on the menu and he doesn't make a very good living with his job.  Well I no matter what will never eat alone in a restaurant, especially meat loaf of all things!  Besides, according to the movie that's how you get shot by someone who wants revenge. :-)   Lol, do you know what movie I'm talking about?

20090226210320AArZ2iQ	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	After having alcohol poisoning how long should I wait before drinking again?	I'm 19 yr old male, weigh about 60 kgs, 5' 6'' tall and slim. I had alcohol poisoning around 4 days back when I drank 500ml of Tequila and 333ml of Margarita with some friends. I went crazy after that: lost control of myself, threw up all over my friend's place and they had to call 911. I guess not having any solid food within 5 hrs of drinking and taking in shots made the situation worse, because a week before that I drank 250 ml of Rum without any significant effect.      Anyways after having that alcohol poisoning I had to spend a night in a hospital & was released the next morning. I felt quite weak for almost a day and a half but now I'm quite fine.       Now I was wondering how long should I wait before drinking again so that I don't have poisoning again. Do you think 6 days should be enough?       P.S. -  I just started drinking for about a month now.

He loves it and it is the only thing, other than juice, that he will drink in his bottle. It says that it is a cousin of yogurt and I know that it is very good for you, but I don't know if there is such a thing as too much of it. Please help me. I don't want to give anything bad to my baby.
