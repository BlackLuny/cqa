20090202104451AA4kQrJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How Much Would It Cost To Upgrade My Laptop?	I have an Advent 4211 and I would like to upgrade it. However, I would like to know approximately how much it would cost. I live in the UK and I use ￡ sterling. I would like to:      1. Have another gb of ram, making it to 2gb (1GB 5300 DDR2 RAM )      2. A bios update, for some reason this will bring my Integrated graphics card to 224mb instead of 128mb.       3. A usb dvd burner, as my laptop is a netbook so it doesn't have a dvd drive.       4. An overclock of the Intel Atom processor from 1.6Ghz to just under 2Ghz.      I Know I should just go to the shop and ask there but I would like to know how much it would cost because I'm going to the bank first thing tomorrow morning to upgrade my bank account so I'll just get the money out then instead of having to make two trips to the shop.      Also, because I'm 15, do computer companies not take kids seriously because they might think i'm just a kid so I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't want to get ripped off because I have heard of this happening before; sometimes my friends get overcharged in other places because the owners think that they won't know any difference. Thank you

20090202113117AAc5XxR	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Windows doesn't recognize my newly added 1GB of RAM?	First off I got a HP Pavilion a1320n running XP Media Center. The computer has 2 Slots for RAM, 1 all ready filled with a 1GB Stick. I used Crucial.com's Scanner to get another compatible 1GB of RAM.      I installed/put it in. But when I turn on my computer and go to View Systems Info, it remains 960MB.      I used cpuz and it reads that I have both sticks of RAM in there.  I've switched the RAMs placement, so I know that the new one I bought works, and that both my RAM slots are working just running them at the same time seems to be the problem as it only shows 1GB. So I'm confused on what I should do to fix this.         And here's a chunk of what cpuz says about my RAM sticks:         DIMM #1      General   Memory type DDR2   Manufacturer (ID) Micron Technology (2CFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)   Size 1024 MBytes   Max bandwidth PC4300 (266 MHz)   Part number 16HTF12864AY-53EB1   Serial number 43156E1D   Manufacturing date Week 72/Year 05      Attributes   Number of banks 2   Data width 64 bits   Correction None      Timings table   Frequency (MHz) 200 266   CAS# 3.0 4.0   RAS# to CAS# delay 3 4   RAS# Precharge 3 4   TRAS# 9 12         DIMM #2      General   Memory type DDR2   Manufacturer (ID) Micron Technology (2C00000000000000)   Size 1024 MBytes   Max bandwidth PC5300 (333 MHz)   Part number 8HTF12864AY-667E1   Serial number E80C52E0   Manufacturing date Week 24/Year 08      Attributes   Number of banks 1   Data width 64 bits   Correction None      Timings table   Frequency (MHz) 200 266 333   CAS# 3.0 4.0 5.0   RAS# to CAS# delay 3 4 5   RAS# Precharge 3 4 5   TRAS# 9 12 15         It seems the first one has 2 banks, and the other goes up to 333MHz, might that be the problem?

20090202113423AA1RM2X	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Would you recommend this laptop?	My wife and I are looking to upgrade from a 7 year old desktop to a laptop to increase mobility and save room with our baby on the way.      We are NOT gamers!!      She is a grad student, so she uses it mostly for school and internet (research).  Saving to CD and/or DVD is a huge plus.      I check email, surf the net, and manage iTunes.  Maybe a game here or there (Scrabble, Cards, nothing huge by any means).      Would you recommend this as a good system to go with based on what it has and what we'd use it for?       http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...       Thanks!

I've had my dreamcast since it came out long ago, in fact I have two, and recently I tried to burn a game for it. I had to use one of those "boot disc" things. Now when I try play anything on it none of my 4 controllers work at the initial "time and date" screen. This happens on both dreamcasts. Since this screen is the first one I can't tell if my controllers are broken or if my dreamcasts are broken.   Also, I hadn't played the DCs for years before trying the boot disc and burned game, so I can't say that had anything to do with it.   Has anyone heard of anything like this? Can I reset my dreamcasts back to factory settings some way? I'll gladly open them up if I have to.   I'm just afraid that whatever program I put on that boot disc screwed up the software or something. Anyone have a clue?   A free 10 points if anyone can help :)   Thanks

20090203164214AAxB8rW	Computers & Internet;Security	CONSTANT Windows Malware Issues... It wont go away!?	Hi im in need of a little guidance here... I bought a Macbook Pro last year. I use a number of programs that are Windows only, so I liked the idea of being able to use Bootcamp and run Windows for my software-needs. I purchased a copy of Windows XP from an online retailer and installed it using Apple's Boot Camp.     Everything worked fine for several months until I got infected with some nasty malware. It caused sever enough issues (constant BSOD on startup) that I had to completely reinstall windows. Major pain in the butt, but anyhow I was back up and running. About a month after that, I got another major malware issue. AGAIN, I had to completely reinstall. A week after THAT, its happened again! I somehow am a malware magnet and I cant make it go away. I recently purchased a full version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware thinking this would help prevent this problem but it doesnt seem to be doing the job.     I made a special note last time I reinstalled windows to not download anything I wasnt 100% sure was safe and I stayed clear of any sites that may be giving me malware. Im now in a situation where I am going to have to reinstall windows again today, and I want to know... What the heck do I do??? How do I prevent this issue from arising yet again?    Is it possible someone has targeted my computer directly via IP or whatever and is responsible for the attacks? Or is it possible that the Windows XP disc I purchased is infected and installing a bad copy of XP on my computer?    Any thoughts or suggestions??? Im sick of reinstalling windows so what can I do to make sure I dont get infected again?    Thanks so much!

20090203165312AAJaGS9	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	How do i setup my router/modem and wireless router right and more?	Ok... This is my first time trying out yahoo answers so please bear with me...      I currently live in Norway and i am serviced by nexgentel (12mbps, inn/1mbps, out) and Have one speedtouch modem/router (st546i v6) and one netgear wgr614v4 (not the new version.. the really old one)      The netgear wireless router is fairly old.. and has given me several problems over the year/years I've had it while the speedtouch came with my newly upgraded internet connection and isn't all that bad...      This is how it is setup at the moment..      Phone line/internet line (since we do not have a phone..)   |>   one of those that switches the phone line from phone and adsl    (is it called a switch?)    (also.. we do not have a phone so i am not sure if we should have one..)   |>   Speedtouch modem/router   |>   Netgear wgr614v4   |> Via wireless   My computer (stationary) And my laptop usually both at the same time   |> Via wired Xbox 360/my computer if the wireless is screwing with me      Now what i use the internet for is mostly surfing, downloading legal! torrents and playing everything from WoW on the computer to Call of duty on the Xbox 360, i also use it for watching films from my computer via the Xbox 360.      Also for sake of reference the stationary is in a whole other part of the house as the routers are and i only have 1! 30m wire      Now the problem ive been having is with my Netgear wgr614v4 it keeps disconnecting and whenever i try to download Legal! torents and such it says it has a firewall on... i tried going through dmz, opening ports (port forwarding) etc to no avail. And even though it says my ports are blocked i can still get decent speeds (up to 600KByte/s)      Now the real question in between all this text is what have i done wrong? have i connected something to the wrong something? are there settings I've missed? etc... i have tried several times over the years to fix the whole "Firewall"/random disconnects/speed drops and have gotten almost no results... any help would be appreciated..       If you would like please contact me on my hotmail via mail or just plain old msn at zonnopel@hotmail.com (please don't spam ^^)   I also have pictures of the whole setup if you would like to see it for yourself.. and screen shots of the router setups and such..  so please feel free to ask for them :)      Also.. a little sidenote, The wire that goes from my netgear router does for some reason not work with the speedtouch modem/router, if i plug it into that and into my xbox i am unable to connect to the network.. and if i connect it to the computer i have internet but its highly limited... any idea why that occurs? why would a wire not work with a new router but an old one? (the wire is fairly new)      Please feel free to ask for any additional information i might have missed, and if this is to long please tell me so :)      Thanks      Noah

20090203165619AACfYZ9	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	GTX 260 installation trouble, help!?	Ok, so i just purchased an EVGA GTX 260 for my computer. I also just bought a 400W power booster because my primary power supply is only 500W. So, i first installed the power booster (in a DVD drive slot) with little difficulty, then i installed the GTX 260 in the place of my old, outdated, crappy X1300. It fits fine, is plugged into both my primary and secondary PSU's. However, when i start up my computer, it will allow me to log in and everything, but once the computer has been running, it will shut itself down (instantly). When i go to boot it again, it lasts even less time before it shuts down again. Right now ive left it alone for about 20 minutes and im planning to try again soon.       Info on my system:   500W primary PSU + 400W Secondary = 900W power supply   4 GB of RAM   Intel Core 2 Quad Core processor at 2.4 Ghz   320 GB Hard drive ( x 2)      Also; one time i turned the comp on after it turned itself on, there was a quick BIOS message saying that the system had overheated... But I could feel the card as my computer case was open and it was not even warm, so i unplugged the card, plugged it back in, reapplied power and tried again. Since then i have tried about 4 times and the overheating message has not reappeared.       Can anyone offer any advice? Its really disappointing to do lots of research and spend 400 dollars on upgrades and have problems.       Thanks.

I just used it for music and had some old work files I would like to get off the hard drive. The thing is it won't turn back on. It randomly just turned off on me a few weeks ago and now won't turn back on. I think the computer is just fried so I'm hoping the hard drive is ok.      Is there any way I can get the files off the hard drive onto my other laptop? I was looking at external hard drives but how would I go about doing that if the computer doesn't turn on?      Thanks.

Each worker has anywhere from 1-10 different clients.      I would like to group the client records/rows under the appropriate worker. Something like this:      Worker1_first | Worker1_last   client1_ID | Client1_First | Client1_Last   client2_ID | Client2_First | Client2_Last      Worker2_first | Worker2_last   client3_ID | Client1_First | Client3_Last   client4_ID | Client2_First | Client4_Last   client5_ID | Client2_First | Client5_Last      I'm not great at pivot tables -- but I've tinkered around and can't get anything close to what I am looking for.

20090202152010AAYIzK5	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Where are the missing files that I try to delete?	I have been trying to delete some files that I don't want anymore.   But, I cannot locate them regardless of how hard I try.   I run Windows Vista on my computer.      Usually, I download and save video game files in the DOWNLOADS folder.      I deleted ALL the downloaded video game files from this folder which is now EMPTY. I even emptied the recycle bin after these files went there.      To make sure that they are really gone permanently, I have used both START SEARCH and the SEARCH FOLDER in Windows Vista   and typed in a file's name.      For example, one of those COMPRESSED, ZIPPED that I deleted was named, h110309p.       So, I typed in the name on both search engines mentioned above.   I right-clicked on it and selected OPEN FOLDER LOCATION. Then, I was sent to the EMPTY Downloads folder.      Next, I went back to the search engine, right-clicked on the file, and selected PROPERTIES .  I clicked on the DETAILS tab here which showed following.      file name:   h110309p   type:  ZIP file   folder path:  C:\Users\Dave\Downloads   Size: 152 KB   Date created:  26/01/2009  11:29PM   Date modified:  26/01/2009   11:29PM   Attributes:  A   Owner:  Dave-PC\Dave   Computer: DAVE-PC (this computer)      The GENERAL tab of the PROPERTIES box shows the following.      file name:  h110309p   type of file:  (.zip)   opens with:   Adobe Reader 8.1   location: c:\Users\Dave\Downloads   size: 0 bytes   size on disk: 0 bytes         I think the file is no longer in the DOWNLOADS folder because it's empty.       Is the file still hidden somewhere in the computer? If it is, how do you locate and delete it?       If it is gone, why does the search engine still show the file's name and say it has been moved? Is there a way to get rid of it?      I hope someone can solve my problem. I am really frustrated with it.      I really appreciate your help. Thanks.

The way it is setup is with one directly in front of me and the other up and to the left. On the secondary monitor I can't get a resolution of 1440x900. I can on the primary monitor and thats the best resolution for quality. When i put the secondary monitor in 1440x900 it cuts off a couple inches of the left side of the monitor. I tried the "geometry feature" and it still wouldn't get it all the way to the edge. Its really noticeable when you full screen a movie on that side. Somebody please help me out if you can. I can't stand not having both of them set at 1440x900.  And also, the current setting is 1280x800. Its the only way I can get them both to work but its not crystal clear like it should be. Thanks

My laptop's screen recently broke so while it is getting fixed i am using my parents desktop computer when i need it. My mom when she is not doing other things loves to play games on the computer. she downloads the from iwin or big fish games. (don't worry they don't have virus's on them and she has about 10 spybot things on here!) But there was a time a while ago when she was playing a game (idk which one) but when she stopped the sound mysteriously disappeared and then a couple week later it magiclly turned back on again and NOW it is now working agin and it has been months and let me tell you i cannot live without sound anymore! My mom dosn't want to call dell because then she will be on the phone with them fpr hours and as she would say: she has better things to do, so is there any quick fix for this or does anyone know how this happened and what it means or SOMETHING!

20090202154248AAFOpHQ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What the hell is wrong with my computer?	My computer was on the borderline of crashing last week, so I backed up all my files and did a clean reboot and install of windows XP and all my drivers. It booted fine, except for the fact that my LAN port was not recognized, my onboard audio would not produce so much a a chirp, and some random PCI devices showed up in the device manager, and the only PCI device I had was a wireless N card.   I uninstalled the drivers for the unknown devices, and no problems came about. No matter how many times I reinstalled my realtek drivers for my audio, no audio would work, out of ony of the outputs. The drivers in the device manager said everything was working properly, and onboard audio was enabled in the BioS, so I have no idea what the hell is going on. As for the LAN connection not showing up, I tried the Winsock fix, and that did **** all. I also had my uncle take a look at it, and he couldn't figure it out. I figured instead of pissing away hours of my life trying to figure this out, I just went to BCOM and bought a Dlink NIC card and started installing it.    This is where I'm confused the most:   I installed the card according to how the manual told me to (Install the disk first, turn off the computer, install the card in a PCI slot, turn it on and shabang, it's done). I wore a static protection bracelet that was properly grounded, and when I fired my computer back up, nothing. All the lights turned on, the fans started whirring, but nothing showed up on my monitor (kept looking for video input). I'm afraid I may have bricked my computer and I have no idea how in the hell I did it.   If anybody knows, I just want to know what the hell happened, what may have failed, and how I can possibly fix it.   If it helps, this is what I have installed:   nforce 680i SLi LT (most recent BioS)   Nvidia 8600 GT fatal1ty edition   Linksys wireless N PCI adapter   WD 320GB harddrive @ 7200 Rpm   Intel Quad Core Q6600 stock speed (no overclocking)

I forgot the combination to my Master Lock, and cannot get it off to get my wallet.  I'd rather not cut my expensive bag.  The serial number on the back is 904339.  Does anyone have a list of combinations?  I tried all of the tutorials that involve finding the 12 numbers that click; however, after 2 hours of trying, I have given up.  I also cannot wait the 6-8 weeks it'll take to get the combination from the company since my wallet is inside my purse.  Can anybody kindly help me out?  I would greatly appreciate it!

I have done everything in my power to try to get this to work. I've downloaded every single version of limewire I can find including the newest "Limewire 5." I have checked my firewall and all other things that could potentially block it from connecting. I've even yelled at it! I've tried to download "Frostwire" and "360 share" none of those worked well, and frostwire didn't work at all. I am currently working with Window's Vista, which I hear may be the problem.       Can someone offer anything to help me with this complete frustration!?      ...oh and please don't tell me that file sharing is bad or something, I've addressed this deep down in my conscience and I have come to the conclusion that I am very okay with it. =D

So I've formatted my hard drive..I've gotten my video card drivers, I've installed the motherboard drivers, and..yeah. I've gotten everything up and running sans my sound.      Earlier today I opened up IE7 and went to that Windows Update thing..downloaded four optional hardware updates. Two of them had to do with my sound card, which I assume is a Creative Audigy 2 ZS (SB00350)..or is it (SB0350)? IDK. Either way, it's one of those two.      After I installed those updates, I had sound. I shut my computer off to go do my schoolwork, and when I got back on I had no sound at all. My speakers are plugged in, they turn on, and I'm sure they're plugged into the right spot on my computer. Any ideas? :\      I dunno if a screencap of my Device Manager page would help or not.

20090202164428AAYzhNt	Computers & Internet;Software	Is "WinsxsLite" safe to use to reduce size of winsxs folder?	Got a OEM copy of windows vista.       Want to reduce size of winsxs folder (too many "you may never use" duplicated files in it)      Come cross the internet at the best I can, never find a solution (vlite only works with iso, mines a OEM copy, moving the location of winsxs folder does not make a substantial change to this matter)      Finally, at microsoft's technet, I find a post on Jan 30 2009 that some tech savvy just worked out a batch file that will remove all duplicated files(different version) in the winsxs folder and replace them with hardlinks pointing to the newest version. (brilliant idea personally i think it is).      My question is since it's the latest and possibly the ONLY solution to oversized winsxs (and prevent it from growing out of control over time), has anyone used it yet? In perticular, after batching this task, would you be able to use windows update accordingly? would u be able to uninstall hotfixes?      Thank you!

Ok, here is the problem, I just got a alienware m17 laptop today and it works perfect, but when i tried to play a game i noticed that there is a delay between when a button is pressed on the keyboard and when the mousepad starts working. They both do work, just not at the same time. An example is that in a game i cannot turn my head using the mousepad while using the WSAD keys to move around, i first have to stop pressing ANY buttons on the keyboard then wait half a second to a full second for the mousepad to "turn on". This wouldnt be such a huge problem except for the fact that i just paid 3k for a gaming laptop that cant really play any shooters comfortably.

My current system is a eMachines 3070 with 2GB RAM 160GB ROM.  Under System properties --->   Advanced Tab   -----> User Profile, it used to say 205MB under Owner settings.      It currently states, 1.04GB and I feel as though and I'm assuming it should be using all 2.0GB  of my RAM for my one and only "Owner" user profile.   How do I control this?    By the way, this computer used to be within a network and I dropped all other user profiles.    Question 2:   After getting CCleaner, Regcure registry booster, and clearing out almost all of my desktop items and cleaning out my cache, it still takes a good 1 1/2 to 2 minutes to get ready to surf the internet or be ready to be prompted for the next action.
