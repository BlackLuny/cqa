r1BW5Uhiaa	If things like caffeine make you sleepy, there's a good chance you have ADHD. I have ADHD, and when I have things like coffee, I fall asleep. You could go see your doctor if you would like to be treated. It's a simple chemical imbalance. In fact, some people use caffeine as a subsitute for ADHD/ADD medicines, so it's worth trying.|`|DIzRyRS9aa	you might. I have it and have had it for quite some time, and sometimes my adderall will make me really sleepy but at the same time I can still focus.    The best way to be able to tell is go to your doctors, he or she will give you a few pages to fill out and they can diagnose you from there.    Online sources aren't always the best option. Like say googling "ADHD symptoms". The best way is to go to the doctor, cause the questions they ask are completey different than any symptom that the internet says.        LOL that girl 2 below me.. it made me laugh cause i thought I was the only one who could fall asleep after a cup of coffee while I'm laying in bed at night! thanks for the laugh :-P|`|QRraaOkLaa	There is a reason that doctors don't perscribe over the phone, and over the internet, and that is because there is no way to determine what you have or don't have.

6303924aca31975d4efe5df45761b87caa	This is sort of a Fermi problem.  If we imagine that there are about 100 million taxpayer households in the United States, then we imagine that a typical aircraft carrier displaces 97,000 tons, that means every household "owns":    97,000 x 2,000 / 100,000,000 = 1.94 pounds of every aircraft carrier.    That's just aircraft carriers.    The Pentagon building is also "owned" by taxpayers.  It weighs about 700,000 tons.  So, that's about 14 pounds per taxpayer.    We can't even begin to estimate the "weight" of National Parks, because that would depend on how deep beneath the surface of the soil you're going to lay claim to.    It's a rather silly question, when you get right down to it, isn't it?

I have experienced issues like this also and it does feel invasive and unreasonable. Even though you rent the property, this is still your home and it does not feel good when someone violates your privacy and makes demands on your time. For notice issues, your original contract is always the go-to resource. If the contract does not specifically state a 24 hour grace period allowed for you to accomodate the owner's request, then it is reasonable to have a discussion with the owner about putting some language into the lease that accomodates your needs. I would check with a local real estate attorney about your legal rights, but I believe that since the bug issue can affect other tennants you have to comply with their timing. I know it is an unfair situation and it is really normal to feel angry when we don't have control over our personal space. www.nolo.com is a good resource for you to find answers to FAQ's re: landlord/tenant issues, as well as finding an attorney to answer your questions. I have utilized this site several times with success. Try to take a deep breath and good luck to you.|`|AA10263406	My guess is that they put the note sometime during the day, and will spray after that point in the day? If they gave you 24 hour notice, it doesn't matter when you receive the note.     "I made a written complaint about the bugs on Saturday and was told that they would send the bug man on Tuesday"    Sounds like they gave you more than 24 hour notice if they told you Saturday.     It can't really take 3-4 hours to take everything out of your cabinets can it?
DDYwnut6aa	You may be able to file as head of household if you meet all the following requirements.       1.      You are unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year.       2.      You paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.       3.      A qualifying person lived with you in the home for more than half the year (except for temporary absences, such as school). However, if the qualifying person is your dependent parent, he or she does not have to live with you.     If you qualify to file as head of household, your tax rate usually will be lower than the rates for single or married filing separately. You will also receive a higher standard deduction than if you file as single or married filing separately.|`|AA10469473	Two people can't each pay OVER half of the cost of maintaining the same household, it's mathematically impossible.  So no, at most only one can file as head of household.    HofH has a little bigger standard deduction, and lower tax rates, than filing single.

JTKCPNnjaa	If you are a covered driver on his insurance, then yes you will be causing him a problem at the next renewal. When the policy renews, your insurance company will automatically run reports from various reporting bureaus to see if the status of the driver (violations) and/or car (accidents) have changed. They will then re-rate the policy based on the data collected.  You will likely see a large rate increase if you are "under age". Different companies treat the age criteria differently and state requirements are also different per state. Males under 25 and females under 21 are usually in this high risk group.  If you are not on his insurance, but just borrowed his car, your Dad's insurance will likely be affected anyway. One of the reports that is run is on the car itself. I think they are typically only looking at reported damages on the vehicle, but they may go as far as reporting driving violations with the vehicle. Sorry I don't have better information on this. I will check with someone tomorrow in the personal lines area to see what they can tell me. (I work with commercial policies).    If you have not told your Dad, do it now and save him from finding out on his own when his insurance goes up.  On a side note, don't drive uninsured as you stand to lose a WHOLE lot more if you get into an accident without insurance.    Good luck!|`|kZCgf4mYaa	You can compare how the insurance quotes would change, for example here - autoinsurance.maclenet.com

I bought my gold at $413. Now it's over $900 so I've about doubled my money. There were other ways I could have doubled my money in the same amount of time (not spending as much would have been my wisest choice).    If the economy improves, my gold will tank.

AA11173563	the interest rate is what is sated in the note. The apr is an expression of that rate with the closing cost included. Or for better terms the beneficial amount of the loan.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Interest Rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  When evaluating loan offers its important to understand the difference between the interest rate and the Annual Percentage Rate or APR. Companies are required by law to post the APR next to the interest rate because the interest rate alone is not necessarily an accurate expression of a loans cost. The interest rate is the percentage of the loan amount that the bank is charging you to borrow money. The APR, by contrast, includes other costs of the loan (the upfront fees and any discount points) and calculates them as a yearly percentage of the loan amount. Because of this, APR is a more accurate representation of the true cost of a loan. It is a good idea to compare the APR of different loan offers to get an idea of which loan has the larger overall cost. Visit the GetSmart loan calculator Which mortgage is right for you for help running the numbers.      Discount points   When there is a big difference between the interest rate and the APR, discount points (pre-paid interest) are often the reason. When you pay discount points, you are essentially paying the lender a portion of their interest income up front, in return for a lower interest rate over the life of the loan. A point equals 1 percent of the loan amount and will typically lower the interest rate by 0.125 percent. So if the interest rate is 6.5 percent, you could lower it to 6.375 percent by paying for one discount point.     Other fees included in the APR calculation   The origination fee and any other lending fees -- think of these as the lenders service charges  are included in the APR calculation. These fees can rack up, so they can be a useful point of comparison when deciding between lenders. Private mortgage insurance (PMI), which most lenders require if you have a down payment of less than 20 percent of the homes value, is also included in the APR equation. There are other fees to getting a loan as well, but since these are third-party fees -- assessed by companies other than the lender -- they are not included in the APR.     Some things to remember about APR   The costs included in the APR are spread across the entire term of the loan, in most cases thirty years. Yet very few homeowners keep their mortgage this long. So if you refinance or move in five to seven years, the mortgage with high up-front costs may turn out to be more expensive than the APR suggests. Another thing to consider is that APR is less accurate for adjustable rate mortgages, since its impossible to predict what rates may do in the future. (Consider for instance that in 1980 the average interest rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage was over 13%, more than twice what it is today.)

MmTe8W8uaa	Tax liens are not removed from credit reports until they are paid, even if the statute of limitations expires.  The only legal way to have the UNPAID liens removed is to pay them (even if the statute of limitations expired).    You should dispute the "unpaid" status on your credit report of the lien that was paid in 1997.  Once the status of this lien is corrected, that lien will be removed from your credit report, because PAID tax liens that are over 10 years old are not supposed to be included on credit reports.
MmTe8W8uaa	Technically, yes, you may take the deduction before making the contribution, but I do not recommend this, because if you miss the April 15 deadline for the contribution, you must amend your return, remove the deduction, and repay part of the refund.    The contribution is made when the custodian receives it.  You do not have to put the money in the market.  You may make an IRA contribution and have it go into money market funds, bank CD's, or various other investments that will not decline, and then move it to the market when you want to do so.    The 1099 forms documenting that the contribution was made are not sent until approximately May.  The IRS does not require receipt of the 1099 forms before it issues a refund.  In fact, they claim that some refunds are issued in time for the taxpayer to use the refund to make the contribution.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The IRS gets their paperwork in May.|`|AA11173563	I think you must make it before filing deadline|`|NrvrH4zQaa	Yes, it's OK - but you better make the contribution before April 15!

WgT5l14baa	Corporate executive consider it bad because they don't want to take responsibility for their errors and want someone else to blame when the stock goes down,  Notice that CEOs never talk about speculative activity when the stock is going up; it's always investors recognizing the genius of the CEO.    Some regulators halted short selling on certain financial issues for a brief period because they thought that there was such a high amount of short selling that it was disruptive to the market.|`|ww12lItvaa	It is  "betting" that the stock is overpriced.     In theory an efficient market should fairly price a stock. High short interest indicates a stock "may" overpriced and that the market is not pricing the stock properly. It is saying the market is not working right.    Also it is about short term psychology of the market for that stock or the market as a whole. If it is about the market sentiment it is not about the fundamentals of companies or their ability to make profits.     So short selling or speculation can be disruptive to normal market functioning if it is excessive.|`|0hgTGSZbaa	Short-selling is considered bad, when a syndicate is form to short sell and control the share. It is possible for them to control and determine the price of the share. Especially to its lowest point. When this happens, it can cause panic and concern to shareholders and those who have that share.This will also induce them to sell their shares at heavy losses. If the authorities do not take immediate steps to stop such spellings, it may also cause the collapsed of the company and the removal of the current management by the those short sellers who by now will become majority shareholders.|`|AA10259042	Politicians are always looking for a scape goat and short sellers have always been handy since they do not offer political contributions.  One could hardly blame the bank CEOs since the contribute fast amounts to politicians.|`|AA10566552	Short selling is not illegal (in most cases) nor is it inherently bad.  Short sellers often expose problems with companies by making a bet that the stock will go down over time.  Short sellers can at times have a herd mentality and they can accelerate the decline of a company, but they are a necessary component of properly functioning markets.|`|ghelbcVFaa	Short selling is considered "bad" by the regulatory agencies, most traders, and the media for a few reasons. You don't ask what short selling is, so I assume you know.     You stated that the UK shut down short selling for a short time. So did the US. This was because the felt that short selling was unfairly beating down the market. Let me explain:    Short selling is selling a security before you own it. Regardless, selling a security, especially en masse, lowers the price. After a few really bad days last fall a halt was put on this practice in an effort to stop the strong slides that the markets were experiencing. Once they stabilized a bit, things resumed. Since then on a few occasions you've only been able to short a security when it was on an up-tick. Due to this negative effect that selling has on a price, short sellers become easy scapegoats. Many don't realize, but short sellers also have to "buy to cover" their position, negating the negative effect.    The majority of investors are fundamental or value investors. They buy into a security when the price has been undervalued (some argue that they need short sellers). They hope to see a security rise. Even many swing (1-10 day owners) and day (buy and sell the same day) traders want a stock to rise. When the stock goes down without any bad news, they blame short sellers. Since they are the majority, the minority bears the brunt of the criticism.     Is it justified? At times, sure, but they are trading and out to make money just like anyone else.     Now if you are asking why is short selling bad, not by sentiment, but as an investment, the answer is simple. Risk. If you buy a $20 stock, you know that your per share loss is going to maximize at $20 per share. If you sell short, and it goes up, the sky is the limit on your loss, because any upturn in the stock results in a loss. Additionally, many brokers require the use of margin on short selling. Traditional (and many nontraditional) traders consider this a bad use of resources. To a degree you are right. You are 'gambling' with someone elses money yet you eat the loss. People have made fortunes in short selling, and lost them in short selling. Be careful and use tight stop losses.|`|Xverqpu4aa	You're selling what you don't have.     If markets fluctuate and prices increase. You'll have to buy the product at high prices, only to sell it at low prices as you've already agreed on the deal.|`|CAdFHF9zaa	its basically selling something that you dont own yet,   so if the deal were to fall through and you dont have what you sold, its well..  illegal.|`|h9cEGYO4aa	Its not "bad" and it is legal, not sure what you are asking.|`|RrmO1xkuaa	Well, short selling is still 100% legal. It is bad for the owner, as their foreclosed property is sold for less than it's worth, and all the money that they've spent on mortgage payments now goes as "free" equity for the new owners. Short-selling is great, however, for investors and new buyers, as the first make a lot more money from the deal than from a regular selling, and the second get a discounted house already with equity.|`|P2PNqOJlaa	Most experts know that short selling is not bad and actually leads to market efficiency (without it, the price would only be determined by people who thought the company's value was higher than its stock price, a biased population). However, it is considered to be bad for a number of reasons:(1) it is frequently used as a scapegoat when a stock price falls (consider the guy from overstock.com), (2) people do not understand how it works and think you can "short a stock down" (if you can push a stock price down by shorting it, then you will push it back up when you buy it back), (3) more people are long than short, and if the shorts are correct, the long holders are wrong, (4) in the rare and illegal case in which a short does cause a rumor to profit from his position, it can sometimes become a self-fulfilling prophecy (e.g., if a company needs to raise funds and someone starts a rumor that it is going out of business, it won't be able to raise money and will go out of business) - this is the type of thing that led to the recent ban.  Interestingly, nobody seems to complain when a stock is manipulated UP, of course, they will simply buy it at the inflated price and complain when it falls. Some CEO's actually try to encourage short squeezes, which seems like manipulation to me.|`|dd17NBsUaa	Short selling is only considered bad by those who dont understand the market i.e. politicians.  The buying and selling of shares is done on a free market basis and for every buyer there has to be a seller.  A buyer is naturally positive about the shares they want to buy and think that the price will rise; they go long i.e. hold for long term profits.  A seller is naturally negative about the shares they own and normally believe that the value will fall.     Short selling is where you sell a share you dont own and then buy it back later (usually the same day) at a lower price.  The difference between the two is your profit.  For short selling to work, there has to be someone who is prepared to buy the share from you.  For them to buy the share, they would only be doing so if they thought that the share would rise in value not fall, a long investor.       If the share price rises not falls, short sellers make a loss.  It is normally only fund managers or institutional investors who short sell.  Most private investors do not short sell.     The reality is that the current market instability is not down to short sellers but long investors (those who would normally buy a share and hold it with the view to make long term profits) who are selling as they do not believe there is good long term value in some of the shares that they own.

ZkuYBUByaa	You can take a certificate program to become a medical biller which takes a few months.  But if I were you, I would look into medical coding.  There are a ton of medical coding jobs out there for individuals.  Also, I am a RHIT student (which is i'm going for my 2 year associate's degree) if you do not have any experience in this field, you probably should go the route I am going.  Hospitals usually hire medical billers/coders with at least 2 years work experience.  However, with a RHIT degree or RHIA (bachelor degree) a hospital will hire A LOT faster with no experience.  I am currently in my clinicals at a hospial, a lady with her RHIT got hired right when she finished her degree and hired as a medical records supervisor.  Another lady in that same office finished her medical coding certificate and even interviewed for a coding position but was not hired because of no experience.  So, if you go into this field get the 2 year degree!  Hope that helped!

If he's already decided what he wants to do, I suggest you avoid being legally associated with him as his de facto partner, because if he ruins his credit, it will hurt you too.  So no joint names on accounts, on utilities, or on leases, if you can help it.  The only other thing I can think of is hiding his bills so that he gets behind on one.  That could damage his credit history enough to make them decline him for a loan.  I know it sounds terrible, but it might be for his own good.

If the lease says "security for last month's rent," then you have not actually paid for the last month's rent, but just provided security for it, and must pay your rent on time as usual. If the rent has been raised, you must pay the difference between the final rent and the security for last month's rent. If the rental agreement simply says "last month's rent," then you have paid for last month's rent and do not have to again.

They typically set a price that will drive immediate interest.    Plus they offer no representations or warranties on property.  If you buy a home with mold inside the walls you have no recourse against the bank.  They make you sign  a statement that says they no absolutely nothing about the property and make no representations. So when a regular seller makes those representations there is some value in that and the price reflects it.    Also a bank will agressively drop price every few weeks until they find a buyer.

yJ3GpnXAaa	Firstly, not all overseas eBay sellers are willing to send packages abroad.    The easiest way to find those who will ship to the UK is to use the .co.uk site to search for items that you're interested in.  When the search results show on screen, have a look at the menu down the lefthand side of the page and select the 'worldwide' box (or whichever one you want).    This will then show you clothes that either are already in the UK or where the seller is overseas but is willing to ship to the UK.    If you go to, say, .com and search, the chances are you'll find just the things you're looking for, but the seller won't ship outside the US.    Any overseas listings that you look at will automatically have an approximate pound pricing on them immediately underneath the dollar price.    Keep an eye on postage if you buy abroad because it can be expensive to get packages sent over here.    As far as PayPal goes, it's a doddle.    You don't have to do anything other than pay!  If you buy an item priced in dollars or any other currency, PayPal will deal will take pounds from your account and pay the seller in whatever currency they use.|`|mvDNNC8Caa	iI don't think that will answer your question. you might find that pay-pal is a U.S. co so it works out in $ B4 hand then what ever currency or country you are in. so if I were you stick to dealing direct or though a very very  good friend . that way you will get the best deals and no negative feedback's; so look out don't get stung .  cheers chris.|`|4PhGc9RZaa	I'm not sure.

AA11598210	~~There are placing services where a contractor can pay day laborers for workers, those are the only ones that I know of. They do not charge you, but tend to pay low wages.     Better bet is to go through your phone book and call contractors directly in the trade you are trained in, and ask if they are hiring. My husband is a pool contractor and even though we are not hiring at this time, if he likes someone then we keep the application on file in the hope things pick up.~~

08fca8d3ce700593161cd5877c6d4863aa	Today (February 2) is the deadline for employers to distribute W-2's and 1099's to employees and independent contractors.  The forms have to be postmarked by today so you should expect to receive within the next few days.  Normally the deadline is January 31, but since that day fell on a Saturday, employers have a couple of extra days to comply with the IRS regulations.|`|lGzostFHaa	W-2's had the deadline of January 31st.  Childcare does not send a form.  You will just have to call and get the amount that you paid to them.

I just talked to them today as a matter of fact. The amount they take is the total amount minus collection costs. Those are paid by you separately once you owe zero on the original loan. If you would like more info, feel free to email me
PcGvS4Xuaa	There should be at least one day with some form of training, at least a few minutes of explanation.

Other people that work there are suppose to help you if you need anything
pOFvmrQ5aa	I'm Dan, I work for TurboTax    There has been confusion over this issue.    Prior to entering the amount you received for your stimulus payment TurboTax calculates the "Recovery Rebate Credit" which is what you would get if you did not get the stimulus rebate check.  But when you enter the stimulus payment you received you no longer qualify for the "Recovery Rebate Credit".  So it seems like your refund is going down but that is the way the government program was designed - either you get it in 2008 as a seperate check or as part of your 2008 tax refund.  You got it as a seperate check.    Hope that helps.    Dan, TurboTax Analyst Programmer|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No you are not doing anything wrong.  The software assumes that you are still owed the stimulus until you tell it that you've already received it.  The "refund" figures you see in TurboTax are not valid until ALL data has been entered.|`|AA11333907	I am not sure where you heard that the rebate does not affect the refund but that is incorrect. Neither me or my wife received it so it told us that we are entitled to claim it this year so they added that to our refund. If you already got it, you can't get it again so that's why it deducted
YhZZiV3Maa	My best advice is to ask someone that knows the legalities of tax write-off's.  If your wife stopped selling Mary Kay in 2008, you are still qualified for other tax deductions towards rent/mortgage, utilities, etc.  If she quit selling in 2007, you would get far better advice by asking a tax accountant professional on how to handle taxes for 2008.|`|4e7XRoOSaa	inventory is an asset and you will have to pay taxes giving it to charity would take that burden and turn it into a write off and enable you to help someone in need.

lGzostFHaa	If it is solely you and your wife on your account then you will be covered up to $500,000 (250k per person).  You could also be covered up to 250k per beneficiary PER person so if you and your wife have an account together with 3 beneficiares then you would be covered up to $1,500,000 (3 ben x 250k for each person).      Keep in mind that at the end of this year (2009) that the amounts MAY go back down to 100k per person.  The government will decided whether to extend the higher amounts or let them expire and go back to the normal 100k amounts.  MAKE SURE you factor that in.  The only reason they went to 250k is what is going on with the economy and banks and they wanted people's money secure and wanted them to be confident to invest their money in the financial system.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	The PERMANENT FDIC coverage limit is $100,000 per person per bank.

Go to the IRS web site below and go to page 17 of the 1040 Instructions PDF file to see if you meet the criteria.

7AvSkm9Kaa	I took 2 out of 3 Wilton classes. I learned a ton about cake decorating and have gotten pretty good at it. If you want to get into cake decorating definitely take their classes. Or just take them for fun. I wanted to explore my options and see if it was something I should pursue. If you really like these classes, then consider getting a job at a bakery (grocery store bakery, local bakeries, retail bakery, etc.). If you still like it, go into to culinary school to be a pastry chef. Once you have a degree you can go on to teach, decorate, etc. Good luck!
RNqRnG86aa	It pays to start shopping around for a new policy. The good news is that more than a dozen insurance companies have entered the market since the hurricane-induced meltdown of 2004-06.    Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state's insurer of last resort, has been farming out hundreds of thousands of its policies to startup companies. Firms in that group include American Integrity Insurance, United Property & Casualty and Federated National Insurance. Many have been dubbed poor financial risks, though none has been tested thanks to our mostly storm-free hurricane seasons since 2006.    Companies with stronger ratings have been branching out in Florida, too. One is St. Petersburg's ASI, which recently insured only newer homes, but now is taking on older homes.    If you struggle to find coverage, contact the Florida Market Assistance Plan at www.fmap.org or by calling toll-free 800-524-9023. FMAP helps consumers find coverage. If you still can't secure a policy, an agent will place you with Citizens Property Insurance.|`|Jdj3lInWaa	Wow - any major company should be fine.  good luck|`|2YSKXb8Aaa	Actually any major company should not be fine, many of them are pulling out of Florida shore properties.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Debbie has never tried to write homeowners insurance in Florida, clearly.     The question isn't, who should I go with - it's more like, "Who's willing to take me".  And the answer is, there are maybe three companies that I know of, writing new homeowners policies in Florida.  The ONLY one that's rated, by AM Best, as being Solvent enough to pay claims, is Citizens - the state run insurance company.    Go call a few local agents.  Ask who they have, and ask what the AM Best rating for that carrier is.  If they aren't rated by AM Best, don't take them - because a policy is NO GOOD, if the claim comes around and the company  can't pay.  Sure, they'd be covered by the state guarantee fund - but do you REALLY want to wait three years to get paid?|`|yGIx6wJIaa	Hi how are you?    I deal w/ Homeowners Insurance Companies daily. I study their policies and and ensure they fess-up to their promises that cost "US" Billions of dollars a year.    First, , to start off, StateFarm will honor any claims until the datebyour policy ends, any open issues will still be taken care off, this is not an overnight deal-it's more like a 2 yr phase out, and they will still be insuring vehicles....    The sure and easy way is going w/ Citizens Property. Although they can be "challenging" when it comes to pay for your loss, they are backed by  the Government and that means they wont file Bankruptcy after a catastrophe.    My second choice, (for many it's the first) - Go w/ a better structure -popular Ins. Co. In my opinion, Liberty Mutual is one of those Company. Better structured in a sense that they have been dealing w/ property insurance losses for ages. AND they are huge and insure many other things and have strong Capital.   To me, they compensate a loss (most of the time) extremely well and a very reasonable amount of time......    Average is 3-4 months to process, inspect & pay for the loss, Liberty Mutual does it in 1.5 to 2.5 months.    So, Citizens: Cheaper, slightly less quality        Liberty Mutual : Pricier, Godd Quality.    Just becareful w/ "less expensive" insurance companies, they tend to offer great deals but they fail to allow coverage for things like : water damage arising from your plumbing, and this could ens upcosting you thousands of dollars....    Be good., hope this helps.

O8qdCBzLaa	What happens when you sell a house is that all of the money everyone has to pay into the transaction goes to the escrow company. This includes money from the new lender that pays for the property, fees the buyer has to pay, fees the seller might have to pay, etc. When escrow closes, all of the money is then disbursed to whoever it's supposed to go to. The seller's and buyer's agent get their commissions, any kickbacks to the buyer get paid out, the escrow and title fees are paid, and the existing mortgage company is paid off. The remainder goes to the seller in the form of a cashier's check.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	You'll get the money from their bank at the closing.    But the money you still owe on the house will go directly to the bank that holds your mortgage. You'll only get the balance, if any.|`|AA10788937	You will actually get the money from the closing attorney. Or the attorney at the title office, depends on what you wish to do.

Talk with a lender.|`|VmCncRmoaa	depends where your live    in the UK you will need at least a 10% deposit, the more deposit you have the better the interest rate you will get    on top of the deposit you will also need   solictors fees  surveyors fees  search fees  land registery fees    these add up to approx 3k  and depending on the cost of the house in the uk we also have to pay stamp duty.
Pjm9pg7iaa	Bush's law did change things. In the past, the lender could report the "missing" $230,000 as "Forgiveness of Debt".  One day you owed the money; the next day you didn't owe it. So they could count is as "forgiven".  That money had to be added to your yearly total income. Which was a nightmare. You didn't have enuf money to pay your mortgage, how can you pay tax on $230,000.  So you don't have to pay any income tax to the IRS since you beat the deadline of December, 2009. That is when the law expires..
T6ZT3A57aa	Yes , directors may distribute the entire profits as dividends if they wish. However, this is most unlikely. The directors have a responsibility to operate in the best interests of the shareholders. One of their major responsibilities is to help the company grow it business, thereby creating shareholder wealth. Most companies will have incorporated in their rules one that determines what proportion of annual profits will be distributed as dividends ( usually around 50-60%). The balance is retained in the business as capital for further expansion.
HgdQMWuDaa	Check the lost and found of anywhere you were the time of which you lost it (leave your name and number in case someone turns it in).  Go over every place it could have been.  Next call your credit card companies if you're sure it's not in any of those places (it usually is about a five dollar fee to cancel it and get a new card but often times if you don't cancel it you are liable for any fraudulent spending).     Make a list of everything in your wallet for you and the police. Next notify the police of the lost wallet and its contents (if you so chose to).  Wait a few days, and if nothing turns up, start replacing everything in it, go to the DMV, insurance company, grocery store card, whatever.  Oh and buy a new wallet.

Contact whoever issued the ID you lost about a replacement, and to inform them there may be an ID theft issue.  Say goodbye to anything in the wallet.

TNTFomKeaa	I'm 23 and I'm studying to become a high school teacher. I already know I'll love it as I've spent several years teaching English as a foreign language and coaching swimming and I know that teaching is for me. I find it really rewarding (and about helping people, not making them bow down to me ;-) ). I've even done it when my boss couldn't afford to pay me - I felt that I owed it to my students. Corny but true. Also, I eventually want to get married and give up work to have children - teaching would let me do that much more easily than other more high-powered careers such as law. The downside is the pay, of course.  The next challenge is deciding where to live. I'm from the UK but I find myself becoming unbearably depressed at the thought of spending the rest of my life there, being a tube rat and barely seeing the sun from one end of the week to the other. I'm looking at Masters courses that would let me live and work in a nicer climate and near the ocean!  Good luck with finding your niche!

457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	Medicare rates are geographically adjusted to reflect the cost of living in your area.    You'll have to provide your state and county to get a truly accurate answer.    Everything a person would need to estimate Medicare rates is on the CMS website (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/).  However, it would be difficult for the average person to do without assistance, because the calculations can be very complex.    P.S.  I assume that you're talking about the global rate for physician fees.  Don't forget that there are also hospital fees to consider.  Medicare reimburses hospital fees by DRG rate.  (DRG = Diagnosis Related Grouping)  Every hospital has its own specific DRG rate, so we'd also need to know what hospital you were going to deliver at to estimate the hospital fees.|`|WKfoiiN6aa	I am not an expert on this,however I would like suggest you take a look here http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in... ,there are helpful tips there

At least your date changed, mine still says the 3rd but I spoke with the IRS, and my refund is being delayed due to a "technical glitch".|`|Dv43MoGaaa	Mine did that too and I have called to find out why and never did get a straight answer.  You cannot go by the WMR site or their automated system because what I was told is that both are inaccurate.  It is a big waiting game now to see when it will go in the bank....I think we should be able to charge the IRS interest on our money....they are so quick to take our money and so slow to return it
AA10368727	Yes, you'll get a tax credit for the amount that you spend that's OVER your total annual contribution to the FSA.    The FSA is the best route to go for the first $5,000, because 100% of that amount will be tax-free.  So you'll reduce your taxable income by $5,000.  It won't be subject to federal income tax, social security, medicare, or state taxes (if you have income tax in your state).  It'll put a *minimum* of $1,250 extra in your pocket over the course of the year.    After the federal limit of $5,000, anything that you spend over and above that can be used as a Child Care Tax Credit of 20-35% (depending on your income), as long as the care is being provided for your children while you (and your spouse, if you're married) are either working or looking for work (same requirements as the FSA).|`|pOFvmrQ5aa	I'm Dan, I work for TurboTax    It depends how many children are involved.  If the day care only applies to a single qualified child then you won't get any credit.  If the day care applies to two qualifying children then you would get some credit for the amount you spent over $5,000 but under $6,000 (you get to use $3,000 per child for a maximum of two children to figure the credit).  You don't get a credit for the $5,000 put in the FSA but unless your circumstances are unusual you probably are getting a better tax result doing that, because you don't pay fica or income taxes on the $5,000 and as long as you spend it on qualified child care don't have to include it in income.    Dan, TurboTax Analyst Programmer

hc9PgibAaa	There is no telling how long it will take.  If you do for some reason get your money I would make sure you pay the IRS as soon as possible.

457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	Most state insurance laws use "prudent layperson" criteria.    Meaning...if a "prudent layperson" (i.e. - a reasonable ordinary citizen) would consider the circumstances as an emergency, then the insurance company should process the claim as an emergency.    By the way...hospital claims specify the diagnosis you presented to the ER with, in addition to your final diagnosis.  So, the insurance company should be aware of the symptoms you presented to the ER with, in addition to your final diagnosis.    Its hard to say what happened in your situation, without knowing what symptoms you had that made you feel like it was an emergency.  But you should at least be able to appeal with an explanation of why you felt it was necessary to seek emergency care.    But insurance companies can have tiered benefits ("emergency" use of the ER, and "non-emergency" use of the ER...based on whether or not a reasonable person would consider your situation an emergency).  You can either have a reduced benefit for non-emergency situations, or no benefit at all.|`|y2ZukikXaa	Potentially.  Insurance companies are trying to keep people out of emergency rooms that don't belong there.  I would be surprised if they've denied the whole claim.  Usually they'll just make you responsible for more of the bill.  In other words it wouldn't be odd to have a $250 copay for an emergency room that is waived if you're admitted -- accident being treated different than illness of course.|`|Jdj3lInWaa	Your insurance company should pay as long as you have emergency room coverage.  There shouldn't be a problem with that, call your insurance company again and maybe your agent can help you.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Yes.  They cover what they cover.  Most of the time, if you don't get admitted,  you pay a way lot more for your overreaction.     They aren't denying you coverage - if you look to your policy, it will say, "emergency room visits only covered if you are admitted" or some such.  Blame the doctor, or blame yourself, for not having a life threatening condition.      The policy is what it is - the coverage is clearly worded.  Read it over, so NEXT time you don't have any surprises.|`|AA12071655	Read your insurance under emergency room expenses covered. You'll find you're covered.    Insurance companies are dogs; they'll tell you it's denied and if you swallow it, they saved the money. If you prove them wrong, they'll shrug and say "sorry, honest mistake" and pay up.|`|AA11598210	~~You can try and have the doctor who gave the billing diagnoses code, write a letter to the insurance company stating that the symptoms while not a serious diagnose, appeared to need emergency treatment. This may help them reverse the decision.

ePxILvTDaa	Get a hold of the company that holds your mortgage and see if they will work something out with you for lowering your interest rate. It may cost a few dollars to have this done, but it will save thousands in the long run by doing a re-fi on your mortgage. I did one on my place and it was well worth the extra time and dollars.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Yes, but make sure you have your lender or broker do a cost analysis of the refinance to find out if it's in your best interest to do so. Since it's a 2 point drop, it's kind of a no-brainer that your monthly payments will go down significantly and it's a good idea to refinance. But, you have to compare refinancing and any associated costs with the decrease in monthly outlay.    For example, let's say you save $200 a month on the monthly payment. But, you have to pay a bunch of points or other fees that total $10,000 to have the refinance go through. It would take more than 4 years for the reductions on the monthly payment to equal the $10,000 you're paying up front. Also, consider that your tax deductions will go down by $200 a month, too. So, you'll probably end up owing more in income taxes next year.|`|AA10788937	Rule of thumb is 1 point so you way ahead of the game. Typical FNME loans now have the great rates. I am in the industry. Stay away from brokers, they are just middle men/women. They will do the work for you but charge allot more to get what you can do by visiting the major banks websites and call and do the work for yourself.    You might think you save that much over the life of your loan, but I have never seen anyone go a full 30 yrs on the their loan.    1 problem might be your short time in the loan. Did you have a good down payment? most banks have raised the LTV guidelines.    Also expect 60-90 day rates, with all the refinancing going on loan closing times have doubled.    Make sure when you get your loan you get a lock with a float down option, this way you lock in on the day you apply and if rates drop you can float down to the new rate    good luck|`|lGzostFHaa	If you can get the financing then absolutely refninance this bad boy.

If it's time and a half for all hours worked over 40, then they would get 40 hours at 8.95 for regular pay, plus 5 hours at (1.5 times 8.95) for overtime pay, and the total of those two amounts would be their gross pay.|`|4j7qchZyaa	well what i think is that u should multiple 45 by 8.95 and thats the gross pay   since u dont know what he's beening taxed   know im not quite sure but i think its that|`|6oC6k6hQaa	First of all, to compute overtime, you multiply the 8.95 per hour times 1.5 for a total overtime pay rate of $13.43 (rounded to nearest penny.)  40 hours per week x 8.95 per hour gives you the regular pay PLUS 13.43 per hour x 5 hours to compute the overtime pay for the week...when you add those two together, you get the answer for the wages for the week for John Doe.|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	What's his OT pay.

Pjm9pg7iaa	The standard deduction is $5,450.  For one person.  You could get more than that by itemizing if you had lots of health expenditures and/or home mortgage interest.  A 1,000 a month mortgage payment (interest) would give you $12,000 itemized deduction..

Sorry|`|c649539a309437c894e649c446f570e7aa	Unfortunately, child support is not a tax deduction or even a credit.  Usually when papers are drawn up with a child for the support and custody, etc, included in the paperwork is letting the parent that pays child support to claim the child on the tax return every other year as a dependent.  In other words, my ex pays me child support on our 3 children.  In our legal paperwork, I claim one child every year, he claims another child every year and then we take turns on claiming the third child on our tax returns.    So, no, you can not claim child support unfortunately.|`|radlvH1gaa	the other posters are correct, but in MO, the CP(cust. parent) & NCP, can agree to modify the decree(ie changing from 8:00 to 9, and the tax return claim), if both parties agree to it. this is verbal, so you want to get it on paper, but if the parents get along, sometimes it works without all the cost and drama of court bs. unfortunately, most cp's won't let the ncp get the claim. if you are one of those poor fools who just has a baby momma and a support decree, ...you SOL. get a lawyer

Usually the custodial parent (the parent with whom the child lives) gets the right to claim the child.  If you have a divorce decree or some other written agreement you can claim the child (for example my divorced friend gets to claim his children on the odd years...so he does not get to claim them this year because you are doing taxes for 08 but he can claim next year for 09).  If you have no agreement with the mother in place you cannot claim the child unless the child lived with you for the majority of they year.|`|OYWTG9j6aa	I can not answer for Ohio, but for Federal taxes, payment of child support is not a deduction, nor can you claim the child unless the child resided with you for more than 6-months of that tax year.  An exception is a form that he person with the right to claim the deduction can sign giving you permission to claim the child, but if there is not a strong relationship with the other party, good luck.  I could not find the actual IRS form to have the other parent sign giving permission, but it does exist.  See H&R Block for some dependent issues-link in source box!!!|`|LFTGozfKaa	No.  You have to have custody and the child must live with you for more than 6 months out of the year.

I don't know of any private health insurer, who will write a policy, on someone with Parkinsons.       I don't know of any private health insurer, who will write a policy on someone who is not a citizen, here in the USA.       Put all three of those together . . . no one is going to trade $1,000 a month of insurance premiums, for $5,000 a month in expenses.  They just aren't.  They would go out of business.    Dad is going to have to either do without medical care, or get whatever medical care you and the other kids can afford to pay out of pocket, or, if he's from a country with socialized medicine, he can try to get treatment there.  Although, most of those countries cut off medical treatment at age 70.      Sorry, I think this is just going to be a really hard time for your family.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You can shop around for same, but expect it to be extremely expensive, given his age and his Parkinson's Disease.  You may end up paying more for the health insurance than you could possibly get out of it.|`|RhEhzGbraa	You can try contacting medicare and see if he is eligible.  According to their website      http://www.medicare.gov/default.asp  :    "If you are not a U.S. citizen or a lawfully admitted alien who has lived in the U.S. continuously for a five-year period, please contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 for your Medicare enrollment and eligibility."    The other alternative is to contact the AARP who has health insurance programs tailored towards senior citizens.  The website for AARP is:  http://products.aarp.org/health/    Your other alternative is to check with a social worker in your area for a list of free clinics such as those run by Catholic Charities and other non-profits.    If your father is not eligible for medicare, you might also check into medicaid for him or even SSI under Social Security.  Private health insurance will be prohibitively expensive at his age and might not be available because of his pre-existing condition, i.e. the Parkinson's Disease.    I hope this helps.

7PWfHjAOaa	Sorry Judy1, it appears you are mistaken.  The stimulus check you received in early 2008 will and does affect your 2008 tax return.  It's very simple really, the government gave us a "front" or "advance" on a portion of our next tax return.  Which means, yes, we have to give it back this year.  For example, say you have $500 in Federal taxes withheld on you W-2 (Box 2).  In a basic tax return with no special circumstances you would get all $500 back at tax time.  With the government giving you an advance of say $300 in the form of a stimulus check.  When you file this year the $300 will be deducted from the $500 and your refund will be $200.  However ridiculous and misleading this may be, it is what it is, and we had no other choice.  One major problem with the whole "Stimulus issue" is that the government obviously did not know how much you would make in the oncoming year.  It's unlikely but if you do not have as much Federal withheld on your W-2 as the amount of last years stimulus check, it will not only be taken out of your tax return, you will owe money.  What a sad situation out country is in when the government is controlling our money and what we do with it.  Sorry for the bad news.  Maybe one day we will actually be a free country.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It was never free money, everybody knew that!  It was a cash advance on your next year's return, that's all.  You don't have the choice of whether you want it or not, you're going to get it then or you're going to get it now.|`|AA10469473	No, it doesn't affect your 2008 refund, which is whatever it would have been if there had been no stimulus package or checks.  The exception is if you didn't qualify last year, but qualify based on your 2008 return, you'd receive the stimulus payment added to your refund.    Unfortunately, many of the tax software designers, including Turbo Tax,  took a short cut and calculated the stimulus into your refund for 2008 automatically, then have you subtract it back out if you got it last year.  This is causing massive confusion among people who think it's being subtracted from their refunds - it's only being subtracted if it shouldn't have been there in the first place this year since you already got it last year.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You are entitled to a total amount.  Whatever you didn't get in 2008, you will get in 2009.  That could be zero.
U7nj9Kg4aa	How to get through to them?  Hire a lawyer!  If they are refusing something that is required and it's within the coverage, they have no right to refuse it.  Most financial companies are going through a rough enough time as it is, so I doubt they would want to mess around with a lawyer.|`|RhEhzGbraa	You need to read your son's policy and find out the process for appeal and follow it.  If have already done that and want to take it to the next level, you can contact the Insurance Commissioner for your state and file a complaint and ask them to intervene on your behalf.  All you will need to do is google insurance commissioner and the name of your state in the same line and you should be able to pull up the correct website.  The website will usually have a whole page or multiple pages about how to file complaints related to health insurance denials of coverage.    Do not give up on this.  Your son is too young to be in so much pain.      I hope this helps.

Have you contacted the insurance company to find out why they will not pay due to his age.  I don't think age should have anything to do with it.    I would contact the insurance commissioner in your state and put in a complaint.  They may be able to find out why it is not being covered.  Insurance commissioner offices have departments that handle complaints like these.    My husband just went thru back surgery.  I hope that your son gets the surgery he needs

pposouLYaa	You can compare how the insurance quotes would change, for example here - autoinsurance.undonet.com|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	The raw data shows that the lower your credit score, when lumped in with 1,000 other people with similar credit scores, the higher the claims.  It's just raw numbers, just like 16 year old male drivers pay more.    If your credit is bad due to medical issues or a divorce, you should probably try to find a local TRAVELERS insurance agent - because Travelers, will manually underwrite, if you have a low score based on divorce or medical issues.  Which means, you won't automatically get those higher rates.  But you have to ASK for it.|`|2YSKXb8Aaa	It's odd, but interesting.  Lots of studies have found a very strong link between credit score and their loss potential.  Higher credit score people  tend to have good loss history, while bad credit score people are strongly linked with having bad loss history.  I know it exists, but I agree it doesn't make a lot of sense.  Having a bad credit score does not factor into my driving at all.  But hey, insurers use lots of things to predict losses, and credit scores have proven to be very accurate.    As for what you can do it about it...try and find another insurer that doesn't use credit scores.

qDG7FQsgaa	Lack of personal responsibility.|`|wqV08EcIaa	Lack of financial education.  Nobody teaches you how to use money, besides the lenders.  You don't learn about it in school, and you only learn about it in college if your degree pertains to credit and lending.  Credit is exploited by the lenders and they don't care who they really lend it to, just as long as they get their cut.  That's why everyone is in trouble because we took loan that we could not afford.
MVIIst40aa	it's go up almost nation wide because of the increase in minimum wage.  Many of our restaurant clients have reported to us that they are cutting their staffs in half because of the increase in wage.  Anohter trend we might see this year is employers illegally treating employees as contract workers.  This will avoid not just the minimum wage, but also employment, disability and other taxes for the employer and placing those costs onto the employee.

3b3052873874a18b5ea83205f5549b9aaa	Any bank that gives away free access to FICO scores is not being managed by smart people. FICO is a private corporation that charges a fee every time an individual or a company pulls one of their reports---unless you pay for one of their "packages" that allows you to pull the same individual's report more than once over a certain period of time. Each time the bank allows you to access your FICO report for free (because the bank still has to pay FICO). The only way this would make sense is if the report you're getting isn't really free. In other words, the bank somehow incorporates the fee into one of its services or products that you are, in fact, paying for (i.e. a credit card account, or a mortgage that you're paying interest on)---in which case, they would able to negotiate a discounted fee with FICO.

When you do receive her social security number, you may, if you wish, amend your return using Form 1040X to claim her at that time.|`|O453GOG3aa	You need the social security number, but not necessarily the card.  If you go to the local Social Security office with plenty of id for both you and the baby, you can get a letter that shows the number on it.  You can use that letter to get your baby added as a dependent on your tax return.|`|wADsOOILaa	Don't file until you have the number or it will delay processing of your return.    Call and see if there is a way to get it now.|`|0frJH1zKaa	Yes, you need to wait till you get it. The only time you wouldn't need one is if the dependent was born and died in the same year, hopefully not the case with yours.    http://www.irs.gov/    TaxRef  http://www.pdftax.com/

yAvOmQrkaa	Yes. If you brother was in 12th grade for 10 months in 2008, the IRS considers him a student for 2008.    But the bigger question is whether you can claim him as a dependent on your tax return. You can claim him if you provided more than half of his support in 2008. Support includes his lodging, clothing, food, transportation, medical expenses, and so forth. If so, go for it and save a bundle on your taxes.|`|820d554e7094763dac38ae760d9a7286aa	I assume he lived with you over 1/2 of the year and you provided over 1/2 of his support.  The "student" status of a dependent matters only if he has income.  Since he doesn't, and you support him and house him, he is your dependent.  You also qualify for Head of Household filing status.|`|zTau6hDIaa	Are you his guardian? Did you support him? Did you pay more than 50% of his living expenses (rent, food, etc.)?
5wAAnZPYaa	Is it fair? The employee is ready and willing to work.But he is not allowed to work It is whose fault You {Govt) have to give adequate support.but you are 100% partial,You yourself arrange some bandhs.    If your logic is accepted then It will do to the following:    It is reported that the Govt does not have sufficient funds to pay the retirement benefits and allow them to continue instead of retiring them    If it is true, then they will induce political parties to arrange for bandhs frequently and save the deducted salary by beating the employees in their stomach.|`|TrQ7auS1aa	Be careful while posting such type of statements... Employees r not responsible for bandhs neither for the damage to the property......Some anti social elements r responsible for it, then why should the poor employees pay the price of this..........eployeess businessmen administratos support the bandh bcoz they r afraid of any mishap sucha as riots ,destruction of property etc............they support bandh bcoz they r scared.........  govt should not deduct emloyees pay bcoz they r not at all resposible for bandh,,,,,,,,|`|Trw6QiZjaa	My peers are correct in providing information fopr people misguided like you.  Ultimayely it is not the employees who are resposible. If govt or public forum is good they have to video graph this kind of bandhs and forward necessary case against them. Who will bell the cat?????    Even yesterday there was bandh in Tamil Nadu calling for support to LTTE.

T6ZT3A57aa	In most countries the Federal governments will stand ahead in most matters over State or County jurisdictions.
y7Mwptsraa	In past years, they did do the returns themselves. But, it seems they're trying to get out of that habit. I've spoken to people who've gotten back their blank returns with a letter that basically says, "It's your responsibility. Do it yourself".|`|qR3MYSOIaa	Go to Ufile.ca you can do it yourself for a very reasonable fee, and it's really easy to do.  They ask you the questions, you fill in the answers, and then check off each form you have (T4, rrsp's, donations, rent etc) and then fill in the blanks.  If anything seems off the program will detect it and have you double check it.    Or look in the paper for someone advertising filing returns for a reasonable price.  My sister's friend is an accountant and does this for $20 a person no matter how complicated it is.|`|aifDtz1Naa	Get the return done correctly.  You will be given a copy.  If your situation does not change next year, you can use the previous year to guide you.  If you are relying on them to do your taxes, you will likely get a request for you to complete them.  In the very least they wont bother trying to get you any deductions or credits... But if you have money to toss away......
AHyDHombaa	Sounds to me like Round Two or IRS fcuk ups for 2009.      Most people who were supposed to receive their refunds on the 30th of January had similar problems, ultimately having their direct deposits rescheduled 1-2 weeks later...      I guess check back tomorrow morning and see if it gives you any info.  I don't recommend calling the IRS, you'll just be put on hold for an hour and at the end you'll have no more information than what you started with.

RkfIPD7Iaa	There is no 'tax break' at the moment, but if there is:    1)  It will apply to the 2009 tax year, not 2008.    2) With your low income, you should not have paid any tax.  With a zero tax rate, any 'break' is not going to help you.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	No tax break passed this year will go into effect until next year.
AA10469473	You got the 1098-T because your school's computers send them out to every student.    As to what expenses you can take the LL credit for, go back to page 20 of Pub 970 and read it again, under what expenses qualify: "expenses YOU PAY for yourself...." - if the tuition is waived, you don't pay it, so it doesn't qualify.
0d48b95c977a1e94afbc64b60d0d2d75aa	Just let it fall off as far as the truck goes. They'll probably sell it to a collection agency but they can not take you to court because the agency can not re-age the SOL on the original account. As for the other account, just pay it. It will not boost your credit either way. If you want to boost your credit, either  get a secured credit card for $500 or a secure small loan for 24 months and pay it back in 12.
RkfIPD7Iaa	If you mean you are filing a Canadian tax return for your 2007 and 2008 tax years, yes you can still file it, but not together.  Each return has to be done on the forms for the proper year, and each has to be mailed separately.    FWIW, Cozzy apparently missed the point about you being from Australia.  As a visitor, you pay Canadian tax only on the income earned in Canada.  It's the ATO that gets your world wide income tax.|`|WJ4e4NYzaa	Yes you can claim that. You can claim at the same time as far as when you send it in but it has to be a separate tax return as tax laws change for every taxation year.    EDIT: If your move is temporary and you do not sever your Canadian residential ties, you will have to continue filing a Canadian return every year, reporting your world income. If you are making a permanent move and severing your Canadian residential ties, you will have to file as a part-year resident in the year you move. In subsequent years, you will not have to file a Canadian return unless you have Canadian-source employment or business income or dispose of taxable Canadian property.

H4Fu7yScaa	In years past -- without a doubt you would be getting a raise.    You need to document your attendance / work efforts, then politely ask for a few minutes of your bosses time -- ask for 10 minute during a time when you know he'll be happy (don't ask during the lunch/dinner rush)    Then explain to him that you have shown dedication and aptitude, and that you want a raise.  He will understand that hiring/training a new employee is way more expensive than giving you an extra buck or two per hour.  If your store is hiring other folks / adding staff then chances are you might can pick up some pay, if you are a middle of the road employee, don't expect much -- better to focus your time on getting some education/training elsewhere.  Dude, you work at McDonalds.  that's harsh, but it's true.  Worry less about a raise and more about your next job.|`|1kke1Ps7aa	If you've worked at McDonalds for THAT long and havent worked your way up to "drive through guy" by now you should prly go apply at burger king.|`|yW1wFR2Saa	Damn you should be manager if you haven't been promoted your probably not worthy of a raise|`|vsbKwrZQaa	Definetly.If your review is good(meaning on time and accurately doing your job) then there's no reason you shouldn't .

These two credits are filed on form 8863. There is also the tuition and fees reduction on the front page of the 1040. This credit is limited to a maximum of $4000. See IRS Pub 17 pages 135-136. Hope/Lifetime credits see IRS Pub 17 page233-238.

TwqIpHJLaa	It means you've already been paid $300 and when you figure your taxes this year you will not get a Recovery Rebate Credit unless your current situation results in a credit in excess of $300.  If for example, you have another dependent in '08 (than you had in '07)...you'd get another $300.  If you got married...etc.    If your situation has not changed, you'll not get the Recovery Rebate Credit for '08.    Hope this helps.|`|I7gOLwQbaa	when you file your taxes it asks about the stimulus, because those who did not get a full stimulus are getting the rest in their taxes. For instance if you got 300 dollars back but in July you had a baby, making that baby your dependent you would be entitled to an extra 300 bucks which would be in your refund
xAdfA3aKaa	You need a 1099-misc, which is for independent contract. Please make sure that you were really contract and not actually an employee.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear dk:  I have been represented several clients before the IRS in the past several years and I have been very impressed at their professionalism and their level of knowledge. They are charged with a particular job and they do it well. The IRS has a group of agents called special agents who for the most part are accountants and if they come into your office that bulge in their coat is not a newspaper. If you reported your boss for any reason I am sure the IRS will followup on your complaint. Did you ask for Form 4598 to be filed? It is an official complaint against anyone not complying with the IRS regulations.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear Mark:  If you are separated from your wife for the last 6 months of the year, you can be considered single for tax purposes (IRS rule). Then if you have custody of a child or children you can file head of household. You can also file married filing jointly if your spouse will agree to do that,remember she has the same option as you do. Also remember if you guys get a refund (when filing MFJ) the check will be issued in both names, which some times complicates the issue. See IRS Pub17 pages 20-23.    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provide. Click on my profile to read more.   Errol Quinn  Enrolled Agent   Master Tax Advisor|`|3r2Dp4Dkaa	Depends on whether the children live with you or not. If the children live with your ex, unless she has signed a form allowing you to claim them, you should file single. If they live with you or she has signed the form, then you would file head of household and claim the children as dependents. For more details, go to irs.gov.
0frJH1zKaa	You use form 1040X. No, you can't put tax paid in 2007 on a 2008 return. Instead you must amend 2007.    http://www.irs.gov/    TaxRef  http://www.pdftax.com/|`|MmTe8W8uaa	1. The number of the form to amend any year's forms (including 2007) is Form 1040X.  2. No claim is allowed on the EZ form.  However, when you amend, it does not matter which form you used originally.  On the amendment, you can claim anything that you could have claimed on the regular Form 1040, including the sales tax paid on the new car, if you did not claim state income taxes for the same year.  You are not allowed to claim both sales tax and state income tax for the same year on any federal form.
AHyDHombaa	I think you're asking for it...      Legitimate 1st time homebuyers that are claiming that credit will be under the microscope this year because of frauds that will be trying to claim it illegally.      If and when they do catch on, you'll have a lot more to pay in penalties and interest than just $7,500.  The IRS doesn't take fraud lightly, and yes, that's exactly what you'd be doing if you took that credit.    It's up to you, but I don't recommend it...|`|G3P5htn7aa	Is it really worth finding out what would/could happen???? Probably not.|`|0frJH1zKaa	Yes, you can only claim it if you bought a house.    http://www.irs.gov/    TaxRef  http://www.pdftax.com/|`|jChr0udLaa	It's called tax fraud sweetie.|`|XR03jIndaa	not only will you have to pay it back but  for the next few years your return will be audited. that means delays at the very least|`|7c045f196defd622c0b49c7e450b7322aa	Just enough to fix the error if they catch it this year, but you risk an audit of prior years as well as this one if, or I should say, when they catch it.  And if they don't catch it right away, maybe a couple years down the road, that's when they will hit you with the penalties and interest.
ak3NBmINaa	I doubt you can charge former tenants for what you agreed to rent currently. Why? Because you agreed to the new rent, you rented the unit and you have no expectation that the prior lease agreement is still valid.    Your state law governs, and it probably dictates that you were required to put that unit on the market right away.    You can try anything, though, and in small claims court it won't cost you much to roll the dice.    California has strict rules about how deposits can be spent or returned. I suggest you spend some time googling up "california + tenant landlord law". Also, if you live in a rent-control community, you'll find even stricter rules.    Oh, and btw--in California you must declare the expense and refund the deposit within 14 days of the end of tenancy, but only if the tenant left you his or her mailing address.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Legally, you can require that the tenant who broke the lease be obligated for as much as the entire rent for the lease term as a condition for getting out of the lease. But, the conditions of getting out of the lease should be written up in the lease agreement. At the very least, a tenant should be obligated for the rent missed and the cost of getting a new tenant into the property.    I don't think you can make your tenant liable for the $100 less you're getting per month. I mean, it's your choice to rent it out for $100 less, not his. If you were to rent it out for $100 more, would he be entitled to any of that money? After all, it was because he broke the lease that allowed you to increase the rent. And, I'll bet your answer is no.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	If they broke a lease (written lease) then you do not have to return there deposit at all.....    If the tenant left 7 months into a 12 month lease you can seek the 5 months rent from them --- If on the other hand you immediately re-rented it at $100 lower price then you certainly can go after them for the $100 for the 5 months they weren't there.... Of course you can not seek the rental price difference for longer than what there original lease was.......|`|Au2aI9a2aa	It is called a breach of lease. They are responsible for the entire amount of rent until the lease term is over.  In other words you are now renting for less because of the economy not because of what they owe.  Can you keep there security deposit? Yes if you can prove you loss. Also this must be given to them within 21 days in california of this loss and damages.  You need to check on the tenant/landlord laws in your area.|`|AA11781195	Be very careful!!!  I'm not sure where you're located, but in MA your charges are limited by law.  First, you must be able to prove that you made an honest attempt to re-rent the apartment (i.e. proof of an advertisement in the local paper.)  Second, you can charge for the time the apartment is empty ONLY.  For example, let's say the tenant has a years lease - January thru December.  They move out at the end of July.  You make a good faith attempt to rent the apartment.  You find a tenant to move in on November first.  By MA law, you can charge the old tenant, who broke their lease, for August, September and October ONLY.  Be very careful before you try holding someone liable.  You really need to know what you're talking about!!!  Good Luck.
MmTe8W8uaa	You can each claim the child of your brother or sister if the child:  1. lived with you for more than half of the year,  2. did not provide more than half of his or her own support for the year, and  3. was either (a) under age 19 at the end of the year, (b) under age 24 at the end of the year and a full-time student, or (c) permanently and totally disabled.    Only the person who paid more than half the cost of keeping up the joint home may file as head of household.  The other adult must file as single.|`|XR03jIndaa	one of the questions is "did you pay more then half of the cost to keep up the home".  Only one of you can answer yes to that. not half, more then half.  one claims HOH and the other single|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	Stephen is correct. in addition to his answer, yes you can split the kids up but only one of you can claim head of Household.
yAvOmQrkaa	Wow! I think this is a longer answer than you were expecting...    If the person is an independent contractor:    You should request the person fill out the appropriate IRS form. Often this is an IRS Form W-8BEN (Form: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pd... ; Instructions http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw8ben.pd... ).On that form, the person would write his U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) in box 6. If the person does not have a TIN, the person should apply for one using IRS Form W-7 ( http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw7.pdf ). After receiving the person's TIN, you would issue the person a Form 1099-MISC as you do with your other independent contractors. The person's TIN serves as their identification number on the 1099-MISC.    If the person is your employee:    Generally, wages paid to foreign persons who do not live in the U.S. and who provide personal services are subject to graduated withholding like U.S. citizens and residents. In this case, ask the person to complete an IRS Form W-4 ( http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf ). The person must check Single on line 3, and may only claim 1 allowance on line 5 (unless they are a Canadian, South Korean, or Mexican resident), and write "Non-resident alien" above the dotted line on line 6. Certain foreign persons may claim an exemption from tax withholding instead using IRS Form 8233 ( http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8233.pdf ). Using this information, you would withhold taxes accordingly, and you must add a certain fixed amount to their income when calculation withholding (see page 25 of IRS Publication 515 http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p515.pdf)... Don't forget to withhold social security and medicare tax, unless the person's foreign country has a tax treaty with the U.S. You also need to issue the person an IRS Form W-2, as you do with your other employees.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	You are not allowed to use Form 1099 for an employee (in any country).  For an employee, you must use Form W-2.  Form 1099 is allowed only for an independent contractor.
T6ZT3A57aa	If you have nominated a bank account then the refund should be deposited there. Usually where the returns of income tax are fairly straightforward the processing time is comparatively short.

I am 66 years old and currently in my third semester of college seeking a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering. I plan on doing some part time consulting if I live long enough to get my degree. In the mean time, I am having fun going to school. The hardest thing a young person has to do is find a profession that they will enjoy doing. The money is not worth it if you hate your job.  Good luck and don't settle for less than what you want.|`|AA11791540	first i was going for Business info system got bored then went to major in Psychology just to have a degree. but then again i looked at the costs, and don't have much hope for psychology neither the time waiting. so i returned back to community college working on:  associate degree in Business plus software engineering certificate. hopefully i will finish everything next semester, and they do have internship as well, and much cheaper than university. the one credit cost $79, while the university is like $300 per credit. and i can reach my goal either way.
vJP6yTy3aa	no, genius.|`|Qa0s3HAeaa	Escape to Canada!|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	why would you want to do that.  It is your obligation to pay taxes.    So either full pay or ask for an installment agreement.  If the taxes you owe are for Federal Tax Return visit IRS website and download Form 9465 to request an installment.  The minimum monthly payment IRS will accept for the amount you owe is $25.00 but you should pay more than that monthly because interest and penalties continue to accrue.  Good luck|`|AA10628838	If there were millions would have been doing it all along.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear th:  It is not too hard if you just read the lines-original amount is the amount you reported on your first return. Correct amount is the number you will use now (if this gets too much-just do a completely new 1040 and use those numbers in the appropriate columns). The difference column is just that the difference between the original and the correct.  Do not mail in (can not be efiled) the 1040X for a couple weeks as the IRS should have your original return recorded before you hit them with another one. You can get the 1040X from irs.gov/forms    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provide.

AA10469473	What is your question?
BoAEgaAGaa	First you can choose which is better in any year.      If you file separately then you would lose many credits and deductions.  Even at that, you could be better MFS by moving itemized deductions you both paid from the lower income taxpayer to the higher income taxpayer.  This would lower the taxable income of the higher to pay less tax on their income.  Also in some states like here in Ohio our tax rates are such that MFS is often much better because of the state savings.    You should compute your tax return MFJ and then do each of yours as MFS.  This will enable you to see which way is more beneficial. See Pub 17 page 22 for Married Filing Separately info.    Also a tax professional should have a tax program that will figure it both ways very easily.    Laura H  H&R Block  Senior Tax Advisor 5   **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|CvkTOBZGaa	Hi, I'm Susan, and i work for TurboTax.    for any particular year, you can choose whether to file joint or separate - it doesn't have to be the same every year.    There are a lot of variables that come into play to determine whether your overall tax liability will be lower with one filing status or the other.  It used to be true that there was a "marriage penalty" in the tax code that led to dramatic differences, but those have been reduced, if not outright eliminated, for most people who are filing.  One quick way to find out is to use the TurboTax 2008 Tax Caster tax calculator - link below.  You can input your information then try each different filing status to get an idea what your liability is likely to be.  In simple cases, you are generally better off filing jointly.      One example of a situation where there's a difference is if one spouse has significant medical expenses, where if they filed separately, their income is low enough so that the medical expenses exceed the 2% AGI threshhold for when you can start deducting medical expenses as an itemized deduction, but if you added in the other spouse's income, then they wouldn't be enough to itemize and you would have to take the standard deduction - then from an overall tax standpoint, you might be better off filing separately.  These situations are more rare.    One other thing to consider is that some states have rules that you need to use the same filing status for your state return as you did for your federal return, so depending on your state taxes, that might make a difference.    Hope this helps,  Susan, TurboTax Tax Compliance Service manager|`|t3A9qpQIaa	You can file separate this year but must be joint next year and forward.  I believe it is more advantageous seperately.  Figure both ways to find out.

There is little risk with well established and well known firms such as Microsoft (MSFT) & Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). Make your money work.

Put it into a saving account and let it earn some interest. Unless you really need something then don't spend the money. It is much better to save than spend.
FliE7asyaa	Assuming everything goes O.K. it will be 8-11 weeks. I ran into trouble last year e-filing the injured spouse claim along with my tax return. When you e-file your return you take the risk that the person who receives it at the IRS knows what they are doing. Last year they overlooked my injured spouse claim and processed my return. The refund was offsett and I ended up having to mail in a paper injured spouse claim. It took 15 weeks to get my refund!!  This year I sent everything in thru the mail, just to be safe. Good Luck!! Let me know how long it takes you so that I might give e-filing another chance. Thanks!|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	Per IRS website www.irs.gov FAQ's here is IRS answer:  Injured Spouse    Question:   Can I file my return electronically even though I am filing a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation?

820d554e7094763dac38ae760d9a7286aa	I'm not in MA, but I've done MA returns.  As far as 2007 goes, you have to remember that MA does not let you subtract gambling losses from your winnings.  It taxes you on the total winnings, from which you probably had little or no withholding.  It's the same way here in IL.    In 2008, there is no relationship whatsoever between your federal refund and your state refund.  Other than that, you have provided no information from which anyone could figure out what the problem is.  Did your filing status change?  Your state withholding?  Did you have gambling winnings again?  Any other income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains) without withholding?  Did you claim all the deductions and credits you were entitled to?  Did you get hit with the new penalty for failing to acquire health insurance?    If you paint a complete picture, we can figure it out.|`|hA0QBgDCaa	Did you complete the health insurance schedule?

81wShS3taa	Most likely you will owe more taxes.  You need to file an amended tax return to add the income from the 1099.  An amended return is filed on form 1040-X.  You list the amounts on the original return , the corrected amount that includes income from the 1099 and show the difference between the two.  You need to include an explanation of the changes.  If you are unsure about how to do this, get some help.

Some lenders do charge to run your credit check, some banks wil make the charge a closing cost but it is small, less than $50.    The expense is worth it if you are shopping for the best loan conditions which may amount to a whole lot more.    ----  No, you will not get charged for processing nor underwritting.  Only if they ask you up front, lenders will charge you the credit check.  However, whichever financial institution you choose to provide the loan, if they did not charge you up front, you will find this small charge in the closing statement.

You can keep it in the employer's account, roll-it over to another account, or take it in cash.

zuGKIWfNaa	That link didn't exactly work, but that really doesn't matter.    Banks generally list their interest rates as APY (Annual Percentage Yield). That means how much your money would earn in a year.    So say the APY is 2.5 percent. That means you'd earn 2.5 percent on your $5,000 if you left it in there for one year. So that's $125 for a year.    But you're only leaving it in there for five months, which is 5/12 of a year. So you'd earn 5/12 of $125.

Most insurance companies have a quota that agents must meet on P&C and Life.  Some agents do not like to sell life or they simply don't have the time.  Check with agents and see if you could become a producer for them.  Agents love having a producer.  In TN an agent would give you (a producer) from 75% to 100% of the commission on a policy.  Go visit some agents in your area and see if you can work something out.  Don't settle for less than 75%, I wouldn't settle for less than 85%.  good luck --- and yes there are Life Insurance jobs everywhere.|`|FRqxWj8daa	Western Southern Life.  We are expanding right now.

5BTKscZraa	Your credit card companies are not going to offer you settlements like 50%, for example, if you are current (not behind) on your payments. If credit card companies offered settlements to people who are current on their payments, then everyone would be calling them up and asking for 50% settlements. Basically, the only way you can get into a position to negotiate settlements is to deliberately let your accounts go into default.    Deliberately defaulting on your cards to attempt settlements is a risky and unpredictable move, whether you do it yourself or hire a "debt settlement" firm.  Credit card firms are under no obligation whatsoever to take settlements if you default and they might instead take you to court to try to get a judgement. This tactic will for sure ruin your credit rating.      Credit card debt can be discharged in a Chapter 7 BK filing if you can pass a "means" test, which roughly translates that your income must be below the average for your state. Most BK attorneys offer free consults. Of course you are probably aware that student loan debt cannot be discharged in a Chapter 7 filing.  Another option for the credit card debt is to contact your local Red Cross for a referral to the local Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) in your area. They can negotiate much lower payments and interest rates. They DO NOT negotiate settlements.    With student loans, these are 100% backed by the government against default...because of this, the firms which have your student loans have zero incentive to cut deals/accept settlements.

And the same child can never be claimed by two people - there's 100% chance the IRS will catch it and disallow at least one of the claims.    For her to claim that she paid you to babysit and take a child care credit for it is fraud if she really didn't.  And by the way you would be required to pay tax on it as income.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	The additional $1900 that you will receive as a 1099-C next year(for this year's taxes) goes as UNEARNED Income.   You will be charged taxes on that based on your tax bracket.  For example if you are in the 15% Tax Bracket you will owe about $285 in additional taxes next year.  If everything will stay about the same for this year as it did last year you can use your tax situation this year as a guide.    If you are getting more than about $300 back this year(based on the 15% tax bracket), there is a good chance that you won't owe any additional money, you would just get a smaller refund.  However, if you owe this year, or are getting back less than about $300 there is a good chance you will owe additional money next year.  In this case you may want to go to your employer and have them withhold additional taxes for at least a few paychecks.  Remember this is based on if everything remains about the same and you are in the certain tax bracket.  But if for example you were in a higher bracket such as 33% that $285 would be about $627.|`|AA11694451	You owed $3850 and settled with the creditor for $1950. This means you have an additional $1900 in income for the year. Let's say you already make $30,000 per year. Your employer deducts your income tax (federal and state) based on $30,000 in wages. Well you didn't make $30,000...you made $31,900 which means your employer is not deducting the correct amount for taxes. At the end of the year you may end up oweing for the additional $1,900. It will be a few hundred dollars on your 2009 taxes.|`|OacSIfSiaa	It simply means you will have to report the unpaid portion ($1,900) as income on your taxes.  It may or may not affect the amount of your overpayment (return).    All creditors are required by the IRS to report debts charged off in excess of $600.    Hope this helps answer your question.
dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	you will have to report the amount form the Form 1099 as other income and pay the taxes on the amount.|`|b67w0mM2aa	I had a tax professor in graduate school who told us that "If something feels good, it's taxable." In your situation you will receive a 1099 from your credit card company as you mentioned for the difference between what you owed to them and what you settled for, which is essentially the amount they forgave, or $1,900. The amount of money you have withheld from your paycheck is dependent upon what "with holdings" you originally set up with your employer. Depending on the specifics of your return you might end up without a refund or with less of a refund. To determine how much in taxes you will owe based on your situation I would suggest that once you complete your return for 2008 you calculate your federal income tax rate (take your total tax and divide it by your taxable income). You should do this for both your federal and state return to determine your entire tax owed (I'm assuming no substantial changes in your taxable situation from 2008 to 2009). The negative comes into play when you have a higher taxable income on your return for 2009 and you will owe taxes on that amount.

I used TurboTax last year and it seemed to be just as easy to use as H&R Block.  This year I used TaxAct and it isn't as helpful.  It poses confusing questions and doesn't give you detailed explanations of terms and forms like H&R Block and TurboTax does.     If you know nothing about filing taxes then use H&R Block.  If you understand your deductions or have e-Filed before, then you could probably could get by with TurboTax.  If you have done your taxes for many years and you have nothing that has changed from the previous year then you could use TaxAct.    Of course you could use all 3 online and see how they feel to you.  You don't pay until you file at the very end which is after they tell you how much your return is. :)
vCePK8gMaa	Your only legal option is to serve him the proper Notice to Terminate his tenancy - month to month is usually 30 days notice, but it does vary by state. If your boyfriend does not leave per your notice, you will have to follow through with eviction.    Lease holders can evict subtenants. That is your situation. You have a lease with the landlord. Your boyfriend has a month to month lease with you. You are his landlord. If you want him out, you have to follow the laws. After 3 years, he is NOT a long term guest, he is a legal occupant with rights per your state's landlord tenant laws.    Do not lock him out, put his possessions out or take any other illegal action unless you want to get sued.|`|b5b22241b72a751e94c18311e3dd0dddaa	Legally, you have to formally evict him.

Every state has different rules and counties can have thier own laws too. He has a drivers liscense with your address on it most likely? His has put in a change of address at the post office. It could be near impossible. I would make sure you have your copy of your rental agreemant with you, if you dont have it anymore, go ask for a copy and they will give you one at the office. Take it up to the PD. Ask them, if you can put all his things outside the door and thats it, hes out? If there is a commotion though the landlord could get involved and not happy with you and evict you for this breech of your own contract by having him there, if the landlord walks by and hes saying hes been there three years and wips out his drivers liscence it would not be good for you, unless the landlord really likes you. I would call the PD and ask if you put his things on the pourch, would they enforce allowing him to come back in since hes got a drivers liscence but you have the rental agreement stating he shouldnt be there. You can have your answer right away. Good luck on that. If it gets too bad, and youd rather speak to your landlord about this go do it, but be prepared for the eviction possibly to get you both out.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I like the putting all his crap by the curb approach myself, but that's just me.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	Unless he is on your lease, all you need to do is ask him to leave.

tyM9s3JAaa	Eventually? Maybe. This Year? Not Likely. Sure Sears has struggled the past couple of years, but that is to be expected during a recession. Sears has billions in cash to carry them through these turbulent times and has far less debt than most of their competitors. Not to mention the massive amounts of real estate they could liquidate with their Sears, Sears Hardware, Sears Appliance, Sears Grand, and Kmart stores. In Addition to real estate they have well known household brands such as Diehard, Craftsman, Kenmore, and Lands End that they could easily give up to the highest bidder assuming that things get worse and not better for the company. Unlike many other retailers Sears Holdings Corp is actually forecasting a good year for 2009. So only time will tell, but I wouldn't count on Sears giving up so easily.|`|Su0O55W8aa	It is a possibility that sears and k-mart may eventually go out of business later this year yes, along with many other retailers!|`|mX27tszPaa	Hmm, not that I'm aware of but it seems like in this economy that older department stores are constantly being phased out or shut down by the increase in e-commerce.  Actually, this is ironically causing them to offer more coupons and inventives to shop there, just look at the Kohls ad every week.  Coincidentally, if you are looking for a sears coupon I came acrosss an eHow article that talks about how to get one.  I put that link here incase you wanted it.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4751938_sears-co...    I think sears will be around for quite a while though!
AA10469473	When I appealed my assessment, I went to the county assessor's office and looked up the assessments of all of the houses in my plan (small town, small subdivision of 40 or so houses, so this wasn't too daunting) and their square footage.  Also took pictures of areas in my house needing repair, such as original bathrooms and kitchen while many houses has done remodeling.  And I did get a reduction in my assessment.    Some counties will tell you what they used for "comparable properties" - then your job is to show why they aren't really comparable.    Good luck.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	We had to get comprehensive records of homes that were nearly identical in square footage , age and yard size and compare several different homes in the neighborhood to ours. Every out building, bathroom and bedroom size needs to be comparable. Pools included.  We had to go to a hearing before the tax board which we had to bring all the paperwork to the meeting. The meeting required us to present our information and then the 3 board members made the decision. Yes, it made a difference but don't expect a big reduction in the bill.
kogsyGAPaa	you always have to sign a lease, and always should. It's for both the leaser's and leassee's protection.  Just let them know that it will only be a few months, thats one of the perks of leasing|`|tDC896Ubaa	You don't always have to sign a lease...it's not a "rule" or anything but most landlords do make tenants sign a lease.  You may be able to find someone renting month-to-month and just move in for the 3 months.  Try looking on like craigslist for someone renting month to month or short term.|`|vCePK8gMaa	You are going to have to look until you find a place that rents on a month to month basis AND will accept you knowing that it is only going to be a 3 month tenancy.

AA10274297	Your tax if filing as single, 1 exemption, and the standard deduction, tax would be about $5113.  Your wife filing single, 1 exemption, standard deduction, tax would be about $8113.  Total tax = $13226.  For the two of you filing jointly, 2 exemptions, standard deduction, the tax would be $13719.  So the tax is the same either way (this was what was meant by eliminating the "marriage penalty" a few years back:  that the tax would be the same for marrieds as it would have been for two unmarrieds with the same income).    I think that when you calculated the amounts separately, you counted the entire deduction with each person.  This is double counting the deductions, so it makes each of your taxes smaller than they should be.|`|dd9828f687267720251eb0d68902e8d2aa	There is something wrong with your calculation, I think.  Normally, filing a joint return results in less tax than filing separately.  Have you handled the exemptions and deductions correctly?  And you use different tax tables for joint versus individual filing.|`|AA10469473	The tax system is progressive, which means that the more you make, the higher rate you pay.  When you file a joint return, what you make is the TOTAL for the two of you.  If you file as married filing separately, higher rates are already figured in.    The other thing is that each of you gets an exemption and a standard deduction, totalling $8950 per person.  So $17,900 of your joint income isn't taxed.  But when you just put in one of your W-2's, the program thinks that's all of your income, so takes the whole $17,900 off of the one, when really you only get it once, not once for each W-2.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	When you "only enter your income" or "only enter her income" are you entering it as if you're still married filing jointly? If so, it makes sense that you pay more tax when you add both incomes together -- a married couple that only earned $58,000 or a married couple that only earned $44,000 would owe a lot less tax than a married couple that earns $102,000.    The more you earn, the more taxes you pay.|`|AA11694451	Because your joint income places you in to a higher tax bracket than your two individual incomes filed separately.

Been there done that. And owning a detached home is a lot more expensive than you think with lots more underlying costs etc. Plus, a lot of condos your condo fees pay for the upkeep, you build the equity and viola! Your rich.     It may also be challenging to get a house approved with 3 people on it, seeing that if your still a student, banks are a little more stringent when it comes to lending these days so I'd take the safe route and start off slow.. and move your way up with your GF after...     hope it all works out..

161de69a9833dd88dea520e119827c7caa	Washington does not have an individual income tax, so you will never see Washington income tax withheld.    Oregon does.    As far as what gets withheld that depends on where the company is located and how sharp their HR department is. They often screw up temporary positions and multiple state workers.    If your husband works for an Oregon company in Oregon he probably will only have Oregon tax withheld. Most of the time employers will only withhold the local income tax where you are working unless they have reason to know other withholding is required.    When it comes to filing the tax returns, you are going to file a resident Iowa tax return and a non-resident Oregon tax return. Income earned in Oregon will be taxed to Oregon. All income earned everywhere will be taxed to Iowa. You will have a credit on the Iowa return for taxes paid to Oregon.    So it makes sense to have Oregon tax withheld on your husband's paycheck and Iowa tax withheld on yours.

RTOmb6vxaa	Were I you, I would band together with your neighbors and file a complaint with the city.  If you have an HOA, you can also go that route, though I'm not sure they can do much about it.  Either way, you'll want to jot down the date/time of every incident you can remember, as well as every new incident.  Also, there should be some kind of manager at the house who you can send letters of complaint to.  Make copies of everything and keep a file as you may need court action to resolve the issue.  Good luck!|`|yaaNbLeyaa	My first thought was to complain to the city since there are zoning regulations and/or deed restrictions regarding group homes in most cities.  Even if they're allowed, the city might get involved because of the disturbances or some other violation.  How many people live there and how many caretakers are there?  Codes govern that, too, so you might get lucky if they're violating all sorts of things that might get them shut down.  If I were you, I'd complain LOUD and OFTEN!  The more noise you make, the greater the odds of having the city do a thorough investigation.  You have nothing to lose.  Good luck!
AA11941290	If the property went from Available to Option Pending or Pending Continue to Show or Pending (don't know what State you're in), and your agent does not have an executed contract in hand, it sounds as though the transaction is with another buyer.  You cannot go from available to contingent sale without an executed contract.    Short sales have tendencies toward multiple offers.  If that's the case with this property, notice should have come back to your agent stating other offers were also presented, further, solicting a response from you/your agent requesting your BEST and FINAL offer for the subject property.  If that did not happen, then it's questionable as to the timing of when these other offers may have been received.  Were they already in process before your offer came through?  Perhaps your offer came through too little too late maybe?  Did your agent check with the listing broker, before showing you the property, to find out if there was already any activity on that property?  That is so necessary in today's market for this very reason.    Your agent needs to bird-dog this one and find out what actually happened.  Troubleshooting this episode may provide solutions so that it doesn't happen again.    As for your last question, there are always contingencies with all transactions, contingencies with both the buyer and property.  Efforts are always made sooner than later to clear as many as is possible any outstanding contingencies, but there is a process with every transaction making it impossible to clear them before due process will allow.  If the contingencies with the buyer are not cleared within the expected timeline, yes, it can and usually does go back on the market as active UNLESS there are back-up contracts, in which case it does not go back on the market, but directly to the next one in line.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	make absolutely sure that your Agent ONLY represents you or  he has no obligation to negotiate for you.......only a buyer's agent  will negotiate in your behalf.

4vLt3SqFaa	A number of large companies have housing for employees - even some hospitals but you have to dig deep in their benefits programs to find these.  Disney is one of the largest that makes a big deal over housing for employees.      Air force housing is tolerable for officers with families, for enlisted without dependents it can range from modern barracks to WWII era structures is various states of repair.      As far as combat you are misinformed.  A number of airmen have lost their lives in combat zones including some on the ground in recent years  While overall, air force personnel in supporting roles do not see combat as frequently or in the same numbers as other branches you are still in military service and anytime you join the service you can be asked to lay it all on the line.  If you are not willing to go to war and be in combat the air force or any other service is not for you.  Just so you know, my father had a nice job as a medical administrator at the air force academy then his next assignment was Vietnam.  That is life in the service - one minute as safe and as far from danger as you can be, the next at war.  So join for the right reasons and without illusions about the possibility of combat.

Here are some helpful tips:    1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.    In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.     Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.    Good luck!|`|WoRaXE73aa	This site has a lot of examples on it, but not templates. Maybe it is helpful? You could use it to create a document of your own based on the examples.

0f22faaef7d0fd7f55ebac8094ec4a60aa	In the 1970s the Cryonics Society of California failed because of inadequate financing. The cryonics "patients" were subsequently buried or cremated. The problem at that time was that many of the patients were taken as "charity cases" and many of the others were financed by on-going payments from relatives. The relatives would often stop the ongoing payments, but CSC would still be responsible to keep the people frozen.     Modern cryonics organizations demand up-front payment for projected future costs, which is why the prices seem high. This does not mean that modern cryonics organizations could not fail financially due to fiscal mismanagement and bad investments. There are no guarantees in life. Cryonics organizations could also be blown up by terrorists, or there could be a nuclear war or a meteor could strike the locality of the storage facility. In the struggle to survive, many perish, unfortunately. But that is not a reason to give up on the struggle. Many do survive, and if those who want the future possibilities that cryonics has to offer want to survive, they will work very hard to prevent cryonics organizations from failing.      In the contingencies sections of the cryonics contracts there are provisions for what the cryonics organizations will do if unable to continue patient storage. These include contacting other cryonics organizations for possible storage, contacting relatives or those with an interest to make other arrangements, attempting chemical preservation, etc. If these efforts all fail then there is nothing left to do but to bury or cremate.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	If the management allow that to happen their assets should be frozen.

They are unregulated and limited to their number of investors, unlike mutual funds that are regulated by the SEC and virtually unlimited in the number of investors they accept.

Hedge funds invest in every part of the financial markets. stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, futures and other things. And they can take long and short positions in any investment. and therefore make money when the market drops, and create complex hedging strategies. But they also use large degrees of leverage, with borrowed money, which create a great deal of risk. Mutual funds seek relative returns. Returns relative to an index such as the S&P 500. They seek to do better than the index, but that doesnt mean a positive return. Hedge funds seek absolute returns, positive returns no matter what the market does through shorting and complex strategies of different types of investments which are unavailable to mutual funds..

yCjJJIStaa	There aren't any legal problems with it, unless there are other factors that might suggest age or sex/pregnancy discrimination.  The only real problem with it is that it won't really give you the information you need, because the applicant may not know the answer, and/or may just tell you what you want to hear.    A more revealing version of the question might be, "How does this position fit in with your long-term career plans?"

EsYfnOrkaa	Your accountant can tell you for sure, but many deductions can be moved forward if not taken in the year they were paid. However the best way to handle this is to file an amended return for last year along with this year's return, which will give you the ability to take last years(2007) interest off of last year(2007) and use this years(2008) interest against this year(2008) as well.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	any IRS document can be amended back 3 yrs.|`|736afc7cc6a4a8fd39900662c2379a91aa	make an amendment to the year you did not do the taxes  but then only can you claim it .

For the correction on your 2007 return you would need to file an Amended return.  Go to the IRS website (www.irs.gov) and search their forms for 2007 Amended 1040.  For this year, just file as normal and DON'T forget your mortgage interest this time!  =)

DorePwVOaa	Putting all of that money in a savings account will nearly give you the amount of money you need - $200/month x 12 months x 3 years = $7,200, + the $500 intitally gives you $7,700, so you're nearly there. A savings account earning 2% interest would give you about $50 a year in interest, so that would get you to $7,850.    You could try certificates of deposit (called CDs), which pay a little more interest than a savings account. Hopefully rates will go up over the next three years, and you might be able to get around 4%, which would be about $100/ year, so that would get you to $8,000.    You don't want to do anything with stocks or bonds - those are long-term investments, and too risky for a 3-year period. But since it looks like you can get nearly there just by saving, you should try and figure out a way to earn the extra $2,000, and you'll be fine. That's about $50 extra a month to save - maybe there's some way you can make that, or cut $50/month worth of expenses?|`|NfiXNNGbaa	Stephanie has the right idea, however, CD's aren't something you can add to. CD's are purchased with a min amount, many require $1000 or $2000. What you need is a money market account or savings account that will earn interest while you add to it as time passes. If you're serious about do this you need to make sure to NEVER touch the money once it goes in---discipline---being a military person should help.    join a local credit union, it's better/safer, right now, than a bank...do a little research and ask questions, they are very helpful.  this link might help     http://www.ncua.gov/ConsumerInformation/...
2N6oTOLQaa	You would file with 1040 long form, include schedule C.     On schedule C,  you list the $150 gross revenue, and list out all your expenses which add up to $3,000.     Thus, your total on schedule C is a $2850 loss.     This negative amount will go onto your 1040 form to reduce your overall income. If your income from other sources was less than the $2850, then it reduces your taxable income to zero and you'll owe no taxes. If you had anything withheld, you'd get it back.    Be aware that business losses are a common trigger for an audit, so make sure you have good records. If the loss reduces your income so you can claim the EIC, then the audit is almost automatic.|`|X6rFPI2laa	It would be most helpful for you to see a tax professional about this!

IEre0xoSaa	If your talking about yearly income tax return, up to 3 wks. If you didn't pay for an express return.     If you mean the stimulus check, there isn't going to be a check. On the news they said $15- $30 will be added to each of your payroll checks, equalling out to about $500- $800 per year depending on if your single, or married.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Since President Obama signed the economic-stimulus package into law February 17, I have received many questions about its provisions. And I've noticed that there are a lot of misconceptions about the plan. Here's the lowdown.    Misconception  1: Most people will get their stimulus money as a check this year.    Instead of receiving a check from the government, most single taxpayers will see an adjustment to their tax withholding in their paychecks in 2009 and 2010, giving them about $45 extra per month for the rest of this year (married workers will receive an extra $65). If you're self-employed, you can adjust your quarterly tax payments to benefit from the tax credit. Then you will claim the credit when you file your 2009 tax return next spring, bringing your tax bill in line with your reduced payments.    More from Kiplinger.com:     ? Test Your Recession Survival Skills     ? What the Stimulus Means for You     ? 5 Smart Uses for Your Tax Refund      The stimulus also provides a one-time payment of $250 to recipients of Social Security, Railroad Retirement and Veterans Administration benefits.(People who applied for any of these benefits for the first time after January 31 don't get the money; only those on the rolls in November and December 2008 and January 2009 are eligible.) You'll get the money electronically or by check, depending on how you receive those benefits. Retired government employees who don't receive Social Security will also get a $250 credit when they file their 2009 returns.    Misconception  2: The adjustment to withholding will have to be paid back when you file your tax return next year.    Wrong -- the stimulus is actually a tax credit of 6.2% of taxable wages in 2009 and 2010, to a maximum each year of $400 for single taxpayers and $800 for married couples filing jointly. The credit is refundable, which means that you can still receive the full credit even if it is worth more than your total tax liability.    Paychecks are being adjusted now to get more money into the economy faster. You'll claim the credit when you file your return next year, so your tax bill should adjust in line with the stimulus money (and you might get some extra money at tax time if your withholding wasn't adjusted enough to account for the extra credit during the year, which may happen for some married people in single-earner households).    More from Yahoo! Finance:     ? Boats Too Costly to Keep Are Littering Coastlines    ? Opinion: Have We Seen the Last of the Bear Raids?    ? AIG CEO, Some Staff Get Death Threats Over Bonuses     --------------------------------------...  Visit the Banking & Budgeting Center     But not everyone qualifies for the credit. It begins to phase out for single filers with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or higher, or $150,000 for married couples filing jointly, and it disappears entirely for single filers with AGIs of $95,000 or more, or $190,000 for joint filers.    Misconception  3: The first-time home buyer's credit needs to be repaid.    You may not have to repay the credit, depending on when you bought the house.    If you buy a house between January 1, 2009, and December 1, 2009, you could receive a credit for 10% of the home's purchase price, up to $8,000. This credit does not have to be repaid as long as you own the home for at least three years.    If you bought a first home between April 9, 2008, and December 31, 2008, you are eligible for a tax credit of 10% of the home's purchase price, up to $7,500 -- but the credit must be repaid over 15 years, starting two years after you claim the credit. If you sell the home before you finish paying back the credit, the balance is due in full the year of the sale.    The 2008 and 2009 credits begin to phase out if your modified adjusted gross income is more than $75,000 (or $150,000 if you're married filing jointly). The credit disappears entirely after your income reaches $95,000 if you're single, or $170,000 if married filing jointly. You are considered a first-time home buyer if you (and your spouse, if you are married) didn't own a primary residence in the past three years. The credit does not apply to rental property and vacation homes.    Misconception  4: You can't get the 2009 first-time home-buyer tax credit until you file your tax return next year.    Actually, taxpayers who buy a first home in 2009 do not need to wait until they file their 2009 return (by April 15, 2010) to benefit from the credit. To get the money into the economy faster, the federal government is giving you a choice of claiming the first-time home-buyer credit on either your 2008 or your 2009 tax return.    There's actually a way to benefit from the credit even before you buy your first home. If you plan to buy by the November 31 deadline, you can reduce your withholding on your paychecks right away. The increased take-home pay could help you with the down payment. File a new W-4 form with your employer|`|AA12214443	Usually about 3 - 6 weeks after you file your return.
hu2cZZXFaa	Sub Prime in the mortgage world means B C & D paper which is less than perfect credit or they didn't have verifiable income because they were self employed.     Most of the Sub Prime mortgages are the ARM loans. or Pay Option  loans which are negatively amortized. or interest only loans. These loans for the people who obtained them, are horrible. Obviously they struggled in the past with the financial obligations they had which the banks saw as a risk.    The sub prime mortgages made the market dip because the homes started to foreclose, each foreclosure costs the bank at least 80k + that's where the banks started to fail.. countrywide has the largest sub prime portfolio that's why b of a had to bail them out.. but now look whats happening to b of a then there's JP Morgan Chase, they have a large sub prime portfolio but right now they have a moratorium on all foreclosure loans so they don't loose that money instead they collect on it.. notice how that name isn't in the news much?    Its all bank business & how they handled it. I dont think the people who have sub prime loans are the ones to blame (countrywide is under federal investigation because they falsified documents to get the borrower qualified for these bad loans)      Hope I Helped ( :|`|etEG5KrGaa	Sub prime mortgages were given to people with low credit scores, delinquent credit, stated income or mimimal credit.  Then when these people stop making their payments because they may have gotten a 5 year Interest Only and after the five years, the payment adjusts and is much higher and they can't afford it now. The house gets repossessed. Or they said they made more money than they actually did just to get the loan and the same thing happens. They can't afford it.  So with this happening all over the US, it affects the housing market.

I went and filed at H&R Block on 1/30/09 and it happen to me. I would have not went if I knew I couldn't get the 1-2 day refund. It's very misleading because you don't have to finish filing with them if they would have told you that you were not approved for the 1-2 day refund the day you filed your taxes with them. You could have simply left with no charges and gotten your refund in 8-14 days a much cheaper way. Although you will not be charged all the fees since you will not be getting the 1-2 refund.

You should qualify for Earned Income Credit and Child Tax Credit assuming you passed the income limit test.|`|kMwTqq37aa	You should probably be filing married filing jointly.  You can claim them both as dependents.|`|gaXUIduMaa	In most cases, married, jointly, claiming 2 children.  In a very few cases where one of you are making considerably more and the combined net income would bump you into a significantly higher tax bracket, that filing as married with separate returns can net you with a larger return but it is not often that this occurs.
XHhJ8ffRaa	Nope. Your only choices are Married Filing Joint or Married Filing Separate. To qualify for HOH, you must NOT have lived with your husband in any part of the second half of the year.    You CANNOT file as HOH and filing separate will disqualify you from EIC and other deductions. If you want, you can file form 8379 as an injured spouse so that you get your part back. The best solution is just pay back all the IRS debts so you won't have to deal with this year after year.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	your filing status depends on what you were by 12/31/2008.so since you were married by then you must either file married/joint or married/seperate but you can't file HOH.    since your hubby owes you can still file married/joint but file a injured spouse form 8379 to protect your refund from being offset for his debt.it will delay refund for 8-11 weeks though but it's well worth the wait (if you can wait that long)because then you may get more back and have a much lower tax liability,and did i mention you get credits that you may qualify for by claiming the kids on you'll return (but be sure to allocate the kids in your space on the form 8379)you lose that by filing seperate.|`|hc9PgibAaa	No, you cannot file HOH.  The IRS doesn't care if you got married on 12/31/2008 at 11:59pm.  They expect if you are married you claim married joint or married separate.  You cannot claim HOH because you provided more than half their support.  Also the government provides better tax deductions and credits for people claiming married as opposed to HOH...|`|AA11555162	Why do you want to file hoh?????????????  HOH is an 8k standard deduction and married joint is 10900|`|AA10921553	Do married filing jointly, but file an injured spouse claim. It brackets out his income and your income. It will allow you to "flip" the children over to your side and have none on his side. You will get the monies you are entitled to and his monies will go to pay his back debt. You can file this way every year until he gets his debts paid off.

IRS does issue Tax Refunds, and who told you that you would get it in 7-10 days, Not IRS I sure.
