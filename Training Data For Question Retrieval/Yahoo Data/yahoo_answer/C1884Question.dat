Hi      I finally managed to install windows XP on my Dell 1525 which came with Vista installed. I have found and installed all the sound drivers etc and everything is working fine. The only problem is I can't get the wireless connection going. When you find the WLAN mini card in the device manager it has a yellow (!) next to it. I have tried installing the driver several times which I down loaded from the Dell website and it said it was XP compatable but still no joy!       Can you help?

I suspect it's something trashed in the registry but here's the situation:      Under the list of printer ports (in printer properties) there are the regular items (LPT, USB, etc.) but along with them the names of the various Windows registry hives are listed.  For instance, the list of ports may include: LPT1, USB001, COM, SYSTEM, SECURITY, SAM, etc.      It's weird.  Those items should never be listed here but they are.  Has anyone else ever ran across this situation?

20090309122121AAvmFhQ	Computers & Internet;Software	Need professional help please?	Hello, I have somehow strung myself into a deep problem in my pc (I have a windows XP). I was working with my regedit and somehow locked myself out of regedit. Ive tried gpedit.msc, wont work. Ive tried mmc, doesn't work. My run box isn't there I can no longer right click, cmd has been disabled the only run line i have is command.com, task manager is disabled. Ive tried multiple "regedit re-enabling tools", none have worked. I am pretty screwed, im beginning to think I got a virus because theres no way that I could have done this lest it be some freak accident. And last time I checked I was demoted to a limited account. All that and Im really putting off just taking it to geek squad, last time I went I payed them 150 bucks to tell me i had a trojan and there was nothing they could do about it since it had embedded itself into my hard drive(I trashed that one btw this one ive had for about 6 months and this is the first problem ive had with it).

There are four slots.  I learned that dells dont let you up your voltage so im stuck at 1.8.  Can i buy 2 1gb sticks and add them in along with the old sticks making 3gb? or do i have to take out the old ones and have only 2gb? Thanks!  Also if you can recommend any 2gb (2 1gb) sticks on newegg that would work  it would be greatly appreciated.  I'm looking at around $30-40.  Thank you so much!

20090309145916AAPcIuv	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Need some help with Active server pages?	Hi all.   I've just finished a part time College course learning basic Web Design using DWCS3 and studying HTML, CSS & JS. I'm also looking further into CSS with DW and using the code.       I'm really pleased with what i've learnt so far and decided that i would sign up for another part time college course studying ASP. I assumed that it would be great to further my understanding of this industry but,...   OH MY GOD! What have i let myself in for? My brain is totally frazzled!      I'm into the second 2 hour lesson now, covering the code behind ASP & i cannot get to grips with whats going on! I haven't a clue what my Tutor is trying to tell me... i mean, what are Variables, Server variables, what does DIM mean? What's this... (strItem)? What are record sets and DSN's?      I'm really angry with myself that i've failed to even understand the Basics at the beginning of the course, and the Tutor has told me that after 11 weeks, things will get harder because we'll have to create our own code because DW can only handle so much!      Does anyone have any advice they can offer that will quash my FEARS? Is this a severley difficult subject to learn? Am i wasting my time? Am i just thick? How can i best approach this at a different angle so as to make things easier for myself?       I'm gonna headbutt the wall several times! Help!   But by God, i've paid for this course. It's cost me ￡180 quid and i'm damn well gonna learn it if it kills me!      Please, your feedback, advice & opinions will be greatfully received!      Craig (Dumbass) Worcester, England.

I was looking for a song and only found it on fan pages, it wasn't on the artist's official page. When I looked at the fan pages, none of the music would play. I went to a friend's page and noticed that her song wasn't playing either, even though the progression bar thing was moving and the seconds in the song were increasing like it was playing. Yes, my volume is up - I thought that could be it, something wrong with my speakers, but I tried it on my computer's music player and it worked. Is this a problem with Myspace or just my computer or something? Because I'd really like to have my song. :) Thanks!
20090309143353AAJIjfK	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	A C++ expert is needed!!!?	Write a program that calculates the square root of a number N. The program starts by making a (non zero) guess at the square root. It then uses the original guess to calculate a new guess, according to the formula    newGuess = ((N / oldGuess) + oldGuess) / 2.0;      Have two variables oldGuess and newGuess. Initialize oldGuess to N and calculate newGuess according to the above formula. Use a while loop to iterate such that the difference between the oldGuess and newGuess is less than 1.0E-06. Do not forget to reset the value of oldGuess to the newGuess value in the while loop.    In your program you will prompt the user to enter a positive number. If the number is negative, print an error message and ask the user to try again. For a positive number, calculate the square root using the above method. Find the difference between the square root you obtained and the value obtained from Math.sqrt(). Write out the value the user entered, the square root you computed, and the difference (your square root - Math.sqrt()).

So, i downloaded all this music, and just about to sync it to my iPod, but when i plug it in, and go into iTunes, it's not letting me sync the music. There's no category of my iPod in on my iTunes anymore like there used to be. The iPod is charging though, but i just don't understand what happened. It seems as if something is unistalled, but i just don't know. Sorry this may sound confusing, it's kind of hard for me to put into words for I am no genius when it comes to computers.

20090309144718AANbEzc	Computers & Internet;Security	What should i do about MSN homepage?	not that i want it but theres those msn and msn install icons on my desktop that i never activated when i got vista 2 yrs ago.  clicking either one wants me to install which i always abort.  the other day while finally checking out my toys on Vista and Works i discovered msn homepage was there in template section, i clicked on it, and sure enough that activated msn home page.  THE QUESTION is that the same homepage i would see if i installed from the desk top icon?  would it mess up works or something if i did. if it is the same would i have 2 msn home pages.  finally the only advantage to having it seems that i would have another email which i don't need cuz i have yahoo. (i never even activated email on microsoft vista when i installed-don't need it i got yahoo) what's my next move?

The house has 2 structures: the main part, and a small studio not connected the main house. There is 1 computer in each "house." So the signal must pass through 2 walls. Both computers can access the internet fine, and my PS3 can't (its in same room as computer with adapter). I recently upgraded to a D-Link N router. The router worked fine. The adapter received a just slightly higher signal than the G router, but was very inconsistent. I called D-Link MANY times and could not make it consistent. I switched back to the G router which works perfectly fine, and the PS3 actually reads a signal now(still cant play though).

If you have already tried to download and install the codec, close and restart Windows Movie Maker, and then try to import the file again.   What does this mean, and what do I have to do? PLease help!

Before we get any wrong ideas, no, I don't mean savagely stabbing it in the heart... or hard drive, in this case.       I am currently in joint-possession -with another person, that is- with a really *enter profanity* computer. Seriously, this thing is old, obsolete, and incompatible (1 n33d 2 pwn n00bs in TF2, plz and thnx). However, my stubborn collaborator refuses get a new one.       My question is, does anybody here on the magnificent Yahoo! Answers Community know how to turn off a computer... permanently? This must be done discretely, so, if anybody can inform me of an uber-assassin virus out there, an answer would be great.      Thanks, comrades!

20090309153033AAuAqkR	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Average laptop hard drive temperature?	I have a Dell Inspiron 8100 laptop (bought in 2001) with a Hitachi DK23DA-30 hard drive (30 GB). I am becoming somewhat concerned with heat. The hard drive, when I have only used the laptop for word processing, is about 54 degrees centigrade. As soon as I start using the Internet or playing games such as Rise of Nations or Civilization III (even StarCraft to some extent), it begins to rapidly heat up, getting as high as 65 degrees centigrade, but it usually operates at about 62 degrees centigrade when I am using the internet. It will not cool off until I shut the machine down and let it sit. All this time, CPU temperature rarely rises above 55 degrees centigrade, the hottest I have seen it ever is 60.      Just out of curiosity, is this normal? Is my hard drive failing? If not, what is the average operating temperature of your laptop hard drive, or laptop drives in general?

20090309155058AAJyfMF	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Building a new computer?	I'm thinking about building a new computer system to take the place of my Acer T-180 computer. I've done some research, compared prices and have finally compiled a list of components that I'm ready to purchase. I'm pretty much going to use it for 3d modeling, digital editing, and the occasional gaming. These are a list of parts:      CPU - AMD Phenom II X4 2.8 GHz Quad-core processor    CPU cooling heat sink - Zalman 92 mm ball bearing cooler   Power Supply Unit - Corsair 550Watt 12.2V ATX    Case- NZXT Apollo Black mid-tower case   Motherboard- Asus M3a78 T ATX 790GX   VGA- Sapphire 4850 ATI Radeon   HDD- 1 TB Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm SATA    RAM- G.Skill DDR2 1066 PC-8500 (2x1 GB)   Optical Drive - Lite-On DVD RW+/-   Keyboard- Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000   Mouse- Razor Copperhead Tempest Blue Gaming mouse (*still thinking about something else)   Monitor - Acer 19" lcd widescreen monitor          These are the core components of the computer I'm thinking about building, I was contemplating on buying a copy of Windows Vista 32-bit   but with windows 7  on the way, I was figuring that I would hold off on getting vista since I have it on all my other machines, and wait till 7 is released. I don't know really.      There are other components on my list, but most of those parts I can probably take from older computers. I'm just hoping that everything will work well.       Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. This is the first computer I've ever tried to build, so I'm still a little nervous. I'm still looking around to see if I can find a better deal wherever and more tips when building.

20090309163443AA1mCwn	Computers & Internet;Security	What is the name of that modular network security software?	I remember reading on lifehacker, techcrunch, or somewhere about a modular network utility that included logging, antivirus, etc... It was laid out in a "virtual rack" sort of way. There was a 'community" or open source version and then a version that included some closed-source programs... Can't for life of me find it now.      If I remember correctly, it would run in windows (but may also have run as a virtual machine), and could use dual network adapters (preferred) or a single network adapter if that was all that was available.      Should have bookmarked...   Anyone have a clue what it might be called?

20090309171024AADZaxD	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Upgrading my rig, plan on overclocking, need some info on the relationship between FSB and RAM frequency, help?	Alright, I plan on upgrading to an E8400 with this:       http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.asp...       Motherboard.      The memory standard is 1066, and the FSB on the processor is 1333MHz. I heard that if I put 800MHz RAM in there, it will overclock my RAM automatically, which seeing as I don't have a fantastic case, may cause some heat issues.      Will it auto-overclock?   Would I be better off getting a motherboard with an 800MHz memory standard?      And I plan on overclocking my processor, which as I understand it, has a locked multiplier, which means I'll need to up the bus speed, how will this affect my overclocking abilities and RAM performance? Would getting 1066MHz RAM increase my ability to overclock, or the stability of my system? Any suggestions on threads or guides I should read would be much appreciated, thanks.

I was on facebook and accidentally clicked on an ad and it took me to some IQ test page with eight questions and asked for my cell phone number. I didn't give it (obviously) but when I tried to exit out of it a bubble popped up and said something like are you sure. I clicked okay and closed the window. Then when I went back on facebook (yeah, yeah stupid me) I left the room for like two minutes and when I came back my mom (yes she has facebook) was on her account and clicked another ad by mistake. When I tried to get out of that bubble I got the same message, clicked okay and the window closed. Now I know you can get adware or malware or something like that from those ads but I have Norton and I'm running a scan and it hasn't picked anything up?    Should I be worried about getting a virus or something. I have this secrurity plan where I can take it in anytime I want to get it checked. Should I do this just to be safe? But I can't take it in until this weekend so by then will my computer have already been messed by the virus?   How long until I know I have a virus?

20090309164819AAN8dJ1	Computers & Internet;Security	I password protected a file, now it's saying I typed it in wrong. How can I unlock/see the file?	Okay, so there is this file on my computer that is very, VERY important to me. I put SO much time and effort into it and I put a password on it. When I did it, I was half asleep. Now, this doesn't mean that I made a mistake when I set it, because I'm positive that I didn't. But when I set it, I didn't make a copy of the file. I copied the content IN the file, but when it asked me if I wanted it to be available for other applications after I quit out of Word...I clicked no. Now I can't get access to it and I don't have the content saved anywhere else.      I have tried downloading password recovery programs, but they all have limitations. I have to register and pay for it and stuff, which is a problem, because not only do I not know how to do it, but my parents wouldn't pay some potentially untrustworthy company just to unlock one file that I was stupid enough to stick a password on and mess up.      So, is there a way of getting access to the file without use of password recovery programs, or am I completely and utterly screwed?

20090309171540AA1vBrZ	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Whats the java code for this program?	1.  Use the charAt method to get the first character in firstName and store it in a variable called firstInitial (you will need to declare any variables that you use).   2.  Print out the user's first initial.   3.  Use the toUpperCase method to change the fullName to all capitals and store it back into the fullName variable.   4.  Add a line that prints out the value of fullName and how many characters (including the space) are in the string stored in fullName (use the method length to obtain that information).   5.  Compile, debug, and run.  The output should have your initials and your full name in all capital letters.

20090227101612AA4Dj6z	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Is my video card really that bad?	i have the EVGA 8800 GTS 512   it's always been awesome for me, i can run games like Grid and COD4 on max settings and anti alias without lagging the game down..   maybe not crysis but i never play it that much anyways..      i heard many reviews saying for me to upgrade my video card..      i would've thought they would tell me to do my core 2 duo @ 3.0 or 2gb of ram, or windows xp home (hah)..      what do you think?      i am planning on doing something soon, should i make my ram 4gb? 8gb? or add vista home/premium/ultimate? (they have a service pack coming out soon i think, it's supposed to be sometime before or during june), or should i upgrade to quad core?      i think core i7 and windows 7 is too new and too expensive to be cost effective in the price vs performance ratio, so i'm not goign to mess with building a whole new system until about a year from now at least.

20090227093204AAAb3Rt	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop Battery Will Not Charge?	My laptop has not been able to recharge the battery for few months now. This means I can only operate it when it's plugged into the AC adapter. I was told to buy another battery because it was probably just my old one that couldn't hold a charge. However, I just bought a new battery and put it in, and once again this new battery wont charge. The batteries can still run off the low charge they have so I'm not really sure what the problem is. I think it might be the AC adapter because when I start my laptop, a warning comes up saying the AC adapter couldn't be detected. Once I hit any key windows starts up normally and is able to run off the AC adapter but it just won't charge the battery.   At this point I am very frustrated considering I just threw away $50 on a new battery. Thanks.
