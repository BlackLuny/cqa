Sometimes however you do need inspiration, and some websites such as Cool Nicknames ( http://www.coolestnickname.com ) are good starting points to take ideas from popular names and try and make them your own. Sometimes it's easier to make a new nickname if you can find a supporting image fist, for example an image you would like to post as your avatar within the community. Lastly, there is nothing wrong with picking a simple name and 'jazzing' it up, for example something simple like bubbles could become ~?Bules?~.    All the best   Chrs

All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.

AA11408911	Well Hannah, sadly Yahoo! Answers does not provided rewards in exchange for points. Points are simply required in order to ask questions (each question costs a user 5 points) and are also required in order to increase your level within the community, the more points a user has the higher their level:    Level one: 0 - 249 points  Level two: 250 - 999 points  Level three: 1,000 - 2,499 points  Level four: 2,500 - 4,999 points  Level five: 5,000 - 9,999 points  Level six: 10,000  - 24,999 points  Level seven: 25,000 points +     Different levels unlock news features, for example at level two users can make use of the thumb rating feature and also win a free desktop background. If you make it to level five all daily question and answer limits are removed allowing you to become more active within the community.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Answer as many Qs as you can in one or two sections till you get at least 12% best answers    You can't get one in either P&S or Jokes & Riddles|`|luWaQVOfaa	The Top Contributor badge is definitely a measure of RECENT participation (within the last 1 to 3 weeks).  You can hold Top Contributor badges in up to 3 lowest-level categories at once (except ''Polls & Surveys'' and ' Jokes & Riddles''). Badges come and go on Monday mornings. Yahoo keeps the formula secret, and it's subject to change at any moment. It probably also varies from category to category. Experienced users have formed guesses, but they're just GUESSES.    You probably need around:    ? 30-50 answers per week in the category.  ? At least 20 ''best answers'' in the category within the last 3 weeks.  ? 200 or more total points per week (including all answers, Best Answers, votes, and "thumbs up") in the category.  ? At least a 10% best answers in your chosen category.    If your level of participation falls, you will likely lose your badge. Concentrate on participating regularly and giving high-quality answers in just a few categories to earn or keep a badge.    Good luck.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To be a TC, you need to show knowledge in one to three different categories, except Polls & Surveys and Jokes & Riddles. Choose the three you want to be a TC in, and just keep answering in the categories. Ideally, you need ten percent best answer, but I'm not sure, for I've seen people with seventeen percent best answer overall with two TC badges. Whatever it is, you need to prove that you are knowledgeable in a certain category, and the Yahoo! Answers community will allow you to have the badge(s).

6qsTmMQaaa	Limits are put in place to prevent spam. If everyone could answer to an unlimited extent, then there would be so much spam floating around the site, and I guess the Yahoo! Answers team doesn't want to deal with a lot of spam. However, once you get to level five, there are pretty much no more limits. I guess once you get to level five, the team trusts you to behave responsibly.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	Limits at the lower levels are to allow for a learning curve for new users and to help discourage spammers.     Yahoo! Answers employee Jane said;"These limits help new members get to know a bit more about Yahoo! Answers before they start just asking and answering like crazy. While it may seem really restrictive sometimes, it can also help new members realize what questions are worth more to answers rather than just answering a bunch of polls. If you aren't already, be sure to vote on undecided questions also. Not only will this help good answers be rewarded, but it will also help you progress to the next level more quickly."     :o)|`|wQiGnJepaa	Sometimes people come here and spam every question in a category with links to their web site. For example diet questions often get answers telling to try some magic Chinese, natural herbal, miracle wonder, ultra-slimming tea.

The Error Code 5 is a temporary problem which should go away once you close the additional tabs or windows.     2: You're running the browser-based Yahoo! Mail service, and another mail service (such as Outlook or your mobile phone email service) tried to access your Yahoo! Mail server. Try shutting down your other email services to see if this removes the Error Code 5.     3: If these solutions don't fix the Error Code 5 issue, contact customer care with the steps you're following, up to the point you get the error message:    How are you accessing the Yahoo! Mail service (web or mobile phone)?  Which folder are you opening or trying to open when you get the error?  Which actual email are you trying to open when you get the error?

NDvFr6gfaa	A  dye is useful to change the tone of your hair (you want a little more/less of a certain color), to go darker without a big commitment or to blend grey. However, the reason a dye can shampoo out completely in a few weeks is that it doesn't penetrate the hair enough to make permanent changes or remove pigment from the natural color. This means that it can't lighten your color. You will need permanent color or bleach to do that. You can probably re-dye your hair after a week without undo harm to your hair, but putting a lighter shade of non-permanent color over top won't lighten it. Also, if you're going more than 2 shades lighter, it's definitely worth seeing a professional. I know it's cheaper to color at home, but a mistake can cost hundreds of dollars and several hours to fix -not to mention the damage to your hair.   Dyeing your hair strong colours has its pitfalls but if you don't try, you'll never find out what they are - and the benefits, of having hair that makes you feel happy each and every morning - cannot be overestimated.|`|W40SuZICaa	the independent is the hair w/o the dye. the dependent is w/ the dye.

7u77AiBjaa	You can't do moblogging, since the Yahoo! 360 team announced in October 2007 that they wouldn't fix problems with Yahoo! 360 from that point forward. See http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/blo... .    If you just want to visit your 360 space and you have Internet access on your phone, then just try going to http://360.yahoo.com using your phone's web browser. Click the teeny tiny "Sign-in" link on the upper left of the page. After signing in, the page refreshes and you should click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of the page to get into the 360 space. Then, make 360 space adjustments from there, if you can.      NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it develops an universal profile system (UPS). Yahoo! 360's transition to the UPS (e.g. Y!Profile ) was announced in October 2007 and the Y!Profile actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet.   - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.   - See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for more information on 360 glitches.   - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... .

Here is the main reason to use the .org version = its awesome.  You can do almost anything with it, via themes and plugins.  Plus people will remember your site better if it is joeblows.com rather then joeblows.wordpress.com    Know what I mean?  Use the downloaded version.

The downside is that you don't own it, so you can sell your blog, if you want to. Also they don't let you put ads on there, so you can't make money from your blog. You should also know Wordpress restricts what you can do in terms of customizing your blog.    Basically you get what you paid for and if you host with Wordpress you paid nothing.    If you host with a decent company they will have something called Fantastico installed. You can use that to install Wordpress. You don't need to download it from the Wordpres's site.

If they can't be bothered, then it's a free for all  as far as I am concerned.  .  .  I rarely ask questions because I am capable of finding the answers for myself elsewhere if I need to.

IxoBFCpTaa	>>How to become Top Contributor ?    ?? To become a Top Contributor, keep these things in mind ??    ?? Choose a category ??    ? Pick a specific sub category of all the categories you see to the left of the page. For example, if you are good in science and mathematics, you do not receive a Top Contributor's badge for that category but for its sub categories such as Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc.     ? You can have a badge in up to three categories which will show under your badge on your profile as well as your id card, which is what you see when you scroll over an avatar.    ?? Answer a lot of questions ??    ? Answer many questions in the category that you choose. I would say 25 Answers per week should be a near minimum.    ? Make sure you mostly answer questions you think you will receive Best Answer to. You need a certain percentage of Best Answers and the more you answer without thinking about this, the harder it will become to get a Top Contributor's badge.    ?? Best Answer Accumulation ??    ? Your answers should be to questions you believe you will receive a Best Answer to. Try to answer those questions that have very little or unknowledgeable answers because that gives you a better chance of receiving Best Answer.    ? The Percentage of Best Answers needed is 10% in the category.    ??Activity & Contribution??    ? When you gain the Top Contributor's badge, you have to constantly be on the site.  However, you do not have to not have a life as many people say. Simply 1 hour a day would probably be enough. Remember, this contribution is about 25 answers per week.        ??Here are some Hints??  ? The Y!A staff keeps the formula hidden so users will not abuse their rights. But the formula seems to be like this:    10% Best Answer Percentage   200 points per week    ? Users qualified for the badge will receive it on Monday Morning 12:00 AM California time.  ? Two categories do not provide a Top Contributor's badge because they are only for entertainment; these are:    Polls & Surveys   Jokes & Riddles  ? It is okay to vote for yourself with your only account when your answers to questions are in voting. However, it is not okay to use multiple accounts to do so as this is considered cheating.     ? ? ? ?   ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?      Peace ?  ^_^|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	Keep trying, the answers section is probably the easiest section to get a TC badge in, because of the number of questions open, usually around 1500, which is why there are so many TC's in the category.    Just keep answering questions, quantity is a factor in gaining a badge, you also need to get a few best answers, so look at the resolved questions you have answered, see what made the best answer different from yours. Learn what you can do to get selected as best answer.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Lean everything there is about Yahoo Answers. Become an expert on its history and how it works.

I thought, "I'll never get a TC badge." Try looking for what are known as orphan questions. They're questions that don't have any answers after a few days. Look for those, and answer ones that you know the answer to. You'll usually get a best answer if you do that. Find them in the Yahoo! Answers section.  Also, just be thorough in your answers, and when and if the questions go into voting, vote for yourself. There is no rule against doing that, so don't be afraid to do that.  I hope I've helped.  Good luck.|`|AA10520442	Best Answers are completely subjective.  The asker and the community( when voting )  pick the answer they pick because, well, because they do.  Often there is no rhyme or reason to it.    All I would suggest is that you be as helpful and detailed as you can when answering.
6qsTmMQaaa	It all depends on how many questions you answer. Obviously, if you have fewer answers, and more best answers, every answer will increase your best answer percentage. But, if you have A LOT of answers, and fewer best answers, it might take hundreds to increase your best answer percentage.|`|AA11408911	Well this naturally depends on how many best answers you obtain in comparison to your non-best answers. Remember your best answer percentage is a reflection on how many best answers you have earned in contrast to all of the answers you have provided, in my case every other answer I have given has statistically become a best answer.     Your percent shall rise quicker if you suddenly earn a lot more best answers compared to non-best answers, and will decrease if you obtain more non-best answers than best answers. Also bear in mind that the more answers you provide the more best answers you will need to earn, in my case I need a good 200 best answers in a row before my best answer percentage shall increase by one percent.    All the best  Chrs|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	You have answered 4861 questions so you need 48 best answers from the questions you have already answered to raise your percentage by 1%.  As the number of questions answered increases, so does the number of best answers required to increase your percentage.

7u77AiBjaa	Yes, but you can't get it to automatically play on your Top Page. There are two methods -- one for your 360 blast and two for your 360 blog:    ---- BLAST    See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for details on how to put music in your blast. You can use music that you upload to the web or music already uploaded to the web by other people (faster, easier method).    The song file must be an MP3 file and the web address for that file must end in .mp3. Also, only certain services (music hosting sites, file hosting sites, or blogging services) will allow you to create or use a hotlink to an audio file. So, if you use a search engine to find links, you should definitely check to see if it's working on your page after saving your blast.      ----- BLOG    EMBEDDING MUSIC VIDEO:  There is a sitewide glitch preventing the embedding of videos (and other flash-based objects like music players, photo slideshows, and other widgets) in the blog area of 360. This problem started in September 2008. On some old entries, clicking the "Comment" link or going the entry's "Permanent Link" will allow you to see some objects.    Thanks to the help of some 360 users, they have come up with a few ways for you to embed videos outside of the normal help instructions:    1) A simple deletion of parts of the YouTube video embed code works. See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for details.    2) See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for details on how to convert code for YouTube and Google videos using MY360MI conversion tools. They recently added a tool for Yahoo! Video as well.    3) Create an account on myYearbook.com (http://myYearbook.com ), go to the video section of the site (also located in the bottom center of your profile page), search for the video (or upload the code for one), and use the converted embed code from that site in the "View HTML Source" version of your 360 blog entry. See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for details.      BACKGROUND MUSIC (USING VIDEO):  With the MY360MI YouTube conversion tool (http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... ) in option  2 above, you can select options to hide the video part of the code and autoplay, thereby getting background music in a 360 blog entry.  ______________________________________...    NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it prepares to migrate parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet.   - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details.

Anyone at any level can select a best answer to their question and can vote for a best answer to any question in voting.  You need to be on Level 2 at 250 points to be able to Rate an answer.    To pick a best answer for your own questions.  You need to wait for 4 hours after you submit the question and then go back to the question, you will have a blue tab under each answer, "select as best answer", click the tab on the answer you consider to be the best. Rate the answer 1-5 stars, add a comment if you wish, click submit, you're done. 3 points back.    To vote on undecided questions.  Click "VOTE" on any Category. Pick a question, click on the question to open it. Select the answer you think is best. Click on "Vote as Best Answer". You have gained 1 point.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You *can* choose the best answer, even at level one.|`|MuALb7lxaa	Yes you can. You get emails saying "Heads up, your question may want to be extended" or something of that nature, and you have the option of clicking that and choosing the best answer.|`|AA11408911	All users regardless of level can select the best answer to their question. The option to select a best answer to your question appears once that specific question has been open for at least four hours. It is this four hour waiting period that gives members of the community time to answer your questions.     Once four hours has passed, return to the question via the 'my questions' tab on your Yahoo! Answers profile and the option to select a best answer shall be present under every answer.     Please bear in mind that by default you only have three days in which to return to select the best answer before the question goes into community voting. Yahoo! Answers shall send you a reminder email should you forget.     (And Yahoo! Answers has always had a point system, it's simply been changed around a few times over the years :))    [ Thanks for the update ]    This certainly is odd - certainly something I've not heard occur in the past.

You have to wait at least 4 hours before you can select a Best Answer for an answer to your questions.  Once a question is posted for 4 hours, you will see that "Choose As Best Answer" button.  I don't know where you got the idea it wasn't allowed on Level 1.  You can also vote for Best Answer in the "Vote Undecided Questions" tab that you'll see when you go to any category on Level 1.

suPD7c3gaa	The best way is to click on their avatar to see if they allow email.  If they do, you, of course, also have to have chosen to allow email, or you wouldn't be able to email within Yahoo! answers.  All email addresses remain anonymous at all times when emailing through Yahoo! Answers.    Some might suggest you respond by using the edit feature with your question. If you do that, you risk getting reported for chatting.  Yahoo! Answers isn't like many other forums/message boards where there can be a continuous thread to a comment or question.|`|KN36rGMvaa	When you pick best answer you can leave a comment.  If they allow IM or Email you can send them comments that way.  You can leave a comment on your question by clicking on details but you have to be careful because your question can be deleted for chatting.        Cheers  -Will|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You could e-mail the answerers by going to their profile and clicking the button that says "E-mail [insert user's name here]" However, some people might not have that activated. Thus, you would have to add additional detail by clicking the pencil right beneath your question that says "Edit" next to it. Then, click "Add Additional Detail," and you'll be able to add a response to their question. The user will sometimes come back and check their answer, so they might see the message, and edit their answer.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	Go under edit|`|MuALb7lxaa	To write back or e-mail to the answerer's, you must have your email on your account activated to email anyone on this site. To activate this, go to your profile, and click EDIT and you will see that you can activate your email so others can contact you. To contact them, you go to there profile and hit "Message user", also some users don't allow emails.

0963cb95a32e2b3bc6cd20ab6f60b66eaa	This does tend to be an opinion site. (avoid the Politics & the Religion & Spirtuality sections).   You need to try Science & Mathematics sections for pure unadulturated facts.  If this is an opinion  I'm sorry!
AA12148328	There is a lot wrong with the USA today , so many things have taken a long time to get where we are today . These problems are not going to be fixed tomorrow , it will take time , a lot of time .  We have to think before we decide what can be fixed , and how to fix it .  Remember it isn't just the President making the decisions , it is every politician we have voted into a office , and it takes 2/3ds of a vote to pass a bill .  I believe that Obama will be good for the USA , but time will tell for sure . Give him ample time to make the correct decisions and lets see what happens.  We didn't get into this mess in a year , there have been plenty of blunders , and there will be more , hopefully non severe . No one is perfect  and we all make bad choices , some easy to fix some not .    .|`|0963cb95a32e2b3bc6cd20ab6f60b66eaa	I think Obama will get the stimulus package thru with significant modifications as he believes he must get Republicans (at least some) on board.      He is a well meaning do-gooder who simply doesn't have the Washington experience most Presidents have to have to get things done there.|`|TkXLdosYaa	Obama has no better changes for America than Bush!|`|AA11027952	No politician of any kind has ever done everything they said they would.  Giving them all the benefit of the doubt that at the time they said what they would do if we all voted them into office they really, really ment  what they said.....nothing can be done by 1 single person, because it all goes to votes in the House and Senate.  So, I say some changes will occur (what I don't know) and of course some won't (due to the vote)-I'm just hoping things get better for all of us.|`|Cj2uorAeaa	i personally believe that obama will follow through on all of his promises for change. i think something that a lot of work will go into protecting the environment. he will also probably do a lot to help eliminate racism in the usa.|`|cA3DDRGraa	Great question.  My hopes are that he will be able to turn the economy around and get jobs back here for us.  I hope that the troops will be taken out of Iraq and into Afgahnistan to get Bin Laden, the one who created this mess in the first place.  I would love to see changes so grand that EVERYONE will be treated with respect, regardless of income, religion, or race.  I would love to see that ENGLISH is the language that we ALL speak and not to force us to speak anything different unless it is of our own free will.     gram

Have they changed it?    http://images.google.com/images?client=s...|`|YyXtxeNGaa	I am not familiar with Obama ever having an original thought.  Maybe he has, I am just not familiar with it.  I do know that he has never sponsored any meaningful legislation during his tenure as a public servant.  He has only put his name on other people's bills.    What I do know is that Pepsi has had copyrights on their logos for decades.      It seems that Obama used the same array of colors that appears on Pepsi's past and present logos, does it not?  It seems that Obama used similar patterns as well, does it not?    So I would ask:  Who copied Whom?

F.. k this site, you say what you want, just be mindful of the type of language you use.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	It is chatting.  YA is a knowledge exchange site, not a chat room and is not to be used as one.    Chat is defined in the YA Community Guidelines (link at bottom of every page). There are specific things listed that you may not think are chat, but Yahoo defines it that way and you have to live with it. You should go to the site dizzay.com and see what a YA type site looks like when chat is allowed.    Just stay away from questions that simply ask people's personal opinion or personal information. Those can sometimes be ok, but most of the time they are chat. Stick with questions that only ask for facts, figures, and data like a teacher might ask in school. You can ask for example Paris Hilton's age, but you can't ask what people thought of her dress. You can ask "What is a good SUV for a big family?", but not "What type of SUV do you drive?".    Chatting is asking questions that can only be answered with personal opinion and to which only you and the answerer will give a hoot. You can tell most of these by the presence of pronouns (I,we,you,me,us) or pronoun adjectives (your,mine,ours). If these are present your question will be chat 90% of the time and if you can not rewrite the question without them, it is chat 99% of the time.     People have different takes on violations, but I hope you will reread the community guidelines for other types of questions that are not allowed and specifically spelled out such as Fill in the Blank questions (link at the bottom of the page).|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Asking what anyone is doing, eating, watching, reading, etc is a chatting violation.
