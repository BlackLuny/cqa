20090220134108AAiwf2i	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	100 people take the same exam answering the same question...?	How is it possible that, unless they have copied of the person next to them of course, every single answer will be completely different to the other. You will not find another answer that is word for word the same? This is something I seem to think about a lot and stress out over believe it or not.      I can't work out how hundreds or even thousands of different combinations of words can all have the same meaning. I keep thinking surely there is only one combination, when answering a particular question say, of words that is exactly right, that gives the perfect answer.      When I am reading university textbooks I just can't work out how I'm supposed to remember the text. I don't know how I am going to pass these exams. I keep thinking how I am going to remember this and be able to put it in words come exam time. When I am reading the words of a textbook it all seems to make perfect sense when describing a particular situation and I think to myself well how else am I going to be able to explain this come exam time, what other combination of words would I use?      When you read a textbook how do you actually learn from it? Should you be concentrating on the words or picture in your head what it is exactly that it's saying?       I just seem to have gotten so confused with words these last few years and just can't work out why. By the way I'm 21 and male. I seriously think I'm dyslexic or something.

20090220141226AAkjM8W	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Thinking of going back to college at 30.  Need insight on someone that's done it.?	I'm a recent dislocated worker.  I "officially" lose my job in July.  I currently have an associates in electronics however in the course of my 9 years in the field I've learned that I don't want to move up to designing stuff.  So I've kinda hit my plateau.   I'm seriously considering going back to school to get a bachelor's in accounting which is something I've always liked (money, budgets, finance, etc...).  What I'm curious about is how do classes work at a university.  Are classes spread out over the whole day.  When I went to a tech school I had 4 classes a day one right after the other, 8am-noon.  I want to know because I'm going to have to move back with my parents to do this and have a 30min commute to the university.  Classes spread out would suck.  Also, how hard was it for you all to go back to school later in life (30's or higher)?  Since I'm going to miss enrollment for this fall 2009, does this mean I have to wait until fall of 2010?  I can't start in Jan of 2010?  Any stories or motivation for me would be welcome.  This is a huge decision and will determine a lot in my life.

English Essay - Molly’s next day at home       I try not to imagine what it is like over in the trenches. I keep thinking of Charlie or Tommo lying dead in a ditch somewhere. I miss them both so terribly. Little Tommo reminds me so much of them and that’s the hard part. Yesterday, we were at dinner, all gathered round the table and he gave me this big, cheesy grin. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. He has Charlie’s ears and Tommo’s hair. Sometimes it’s great to look over and see the spitting image of Charlie or Tommo but other times its upsetting because I cant do anything and I’m terrified if the worst happens. The many of people losing their lives in the war and the people who do come back are mostly in wheelchairs, or worse. If I lose Charlie or Tommo, I just couldn’t bear it. I really couldn’t.

20090220144256AAsyOrL	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I be punished for this?	Ok, so my biology teacher strikes me as a complete moron with all the mistakes he makes with his classes. For example, he gives me zero's for not "putting my name" on assignments even when I do, and when I point it out, he gives me half credit. Today, however, he did something that really pissed me off.       So yesterday, someone in my class asked him if we were going to have a binder check today. HE SAID THAT WE WOULD NOT. So, I figured that since we were taking a test today I wouldn't need my binder and he said that we weren't having a binder check, so I left it at home (my locker is currently unavailable to me). When I walked into class however, I saw written on the board "BINDER CHECK TODAY." Apparently he "changed his mind." I lost about 2 percentage points off my grade for not having mine when he EXPLICITLY SAID that we would not have a binder check.      Anyway, do I deserve to lose the points off my grade? I have been working hard in that class as it is my only B and I really do need an A.

Im a senior on the last semester of my high school career, and I have pretty much upheld good grades, and almost a perfect A average.      Well, on Monday I was called up to the office and told that I was suspended out-of-school for ten days, and I would be given a tribunal within those ten days to try and prove my innocence.      Well, there are two rules In the category of the rule book I may have broken. One is "Computer Trespass" and the other is "Computer Misuse" and I was filed under the first one, "Computer Trespass". Computer misuse yields a punishment that is far less severe and does not include expulsion. I strongly believe what I did was Misuse, however I do understand what I did was wrong, and could very well be "Computer Trespass".       I'll explain exactly what I did, and what I used it for. I used the portable version of "Firefox", a free web browser, and went through a proxy into a server to bypass the firewall and get to "Facebook" (Yes, I know that now in retrospect it was remarkably stupid). They called me into the office and had some pictures as evidence of my school account going onto "Facebook.com" and they explained my punishment.       I have two problems with this, one being that I might have been punished for the wrong rule (Thinking maybe i broke misuse as opposed to trespassing), and two being that I received a much harder punishment than others with the same issue.       I will also explain that I hosted the "Firefox" with the proxy already set up on my web server available for anyone to download. Some of the other kids in the school began to catch wind of this, and began downloading the program. I use the program for other things outside of school as well, so I did not notice, and even if I had, what they choose to download is there issue. I am legally allowed to own and run this proxy and host this program, and I have checked with my hoster, as well as Mozilla, the creator of "Firefox". The other students who were caught with the same program were given one day of inn-school suspension and nothing else. I was given a report that stated I distributed the program to other students, which is not true, however even if it were, I cannot be held responsible for what others choose to download onto their school accounts. They found out that I was the owner of the proxy and expelled me when I technically did not commit anything more than the others, seeing as though running a proxy outside of school is 100% legal. So I believe if I am being expelled then that would mean the dozens of other students should be as well.      I have already taken the initiative to e-mail my teachers and ask for work while on suspension and I have also e-mailed my principal hoping he could override the assistant principals decision. My teachers all have e-mailed me back and told me that they would talk to the principal to inform him that I am indeed a good student. My principal has not e-mailed me back yet, and it has been almost a week. I am running out of ideas of what to do. I was thinking of maybe getting my local news involved because my school is a "school of excellence" and any media disturbances would be devastating to their reputation. I am just really upset by this and I am trying to find a way to be allowed back in to finish my senior year. I would even be willing to help them fix holes in their network in exchange, or really anything. I truly am sorry for what I did, all I want is to finish school.      Here is the actual report I got:   "School tech. specialist discovered inappropriate programs in student's folder. It was later determined that student was using program to bypass the school filters and all of the safety protocols. Student also shared the program with other individuals. OSS 10 days pending tribunal Feb. 18-March 3."      Thank you for any help!

20090220151128AAiR91U	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Why is there a religious question on my English test in a public high school?	I'm in Honors English 11 at a public high school in Minnesota. We recently read the novel Bless Me Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya. It is a story about magical realism and has quite a bit to do with Catholicism. One of our test questions asked us to write down two Bible stories that that were portrayed in the book (though the book didn't talk about any Bible stories). The teacher didn't go over the stories that were represented in the book. To me it seems that she just expects everyone in the class to be Christian. I know for a fact that there are a few agnostics, at least one atheist, and one Jewish person. Also, this question was worth 10% of our test grade. I'm just looking for opinions on this and what you all think.

I'm guessing that many people who take this are Japanese, so there will be a significant drop in score with every wrong answer. Alternatively, I could take the Korean with listening and sail through it, but I thought that I would surely get more credit if I took a language that wasn't my mother tongue. Please give me some good advice!! Thanks.

She is currently trying to find another college to go to. I don't know if the husband would be in trouble since he was the one who provided the answers. He is very close to graduation.      Would he be in trouble and get expelled, or would the university let him slide since he is about to graduate this June? It's a shame that they did this. It's better to fail the classes and repeat them again than cheat and get caught.

But the college here (which is actually a whole 5 miles from base and "claims" to be military friendly, won't give him any credit for any of these advanced classes! They say they will only give him elective credit and make him take the high level stuff over again! Even though his degree doesn't require any general electives (just the normal humanities stuff in Psych and Soc). Is this the norm or are we being screwed?! If it is the norm, why in the world are we all psyched up that his college career will be easier because of his training! We can't even get the military to pay for his advanced medical training, and now they aren't giving him any credit for the classes he's already had! Can anyone please give us some advice here? Thank you!

Sometimes it’s great to look over and see the spitting image of Charlie or Tommo but other times it upsets me because I can't do anything and I’m terrified that the worst will happen. The many of soldiers watching people die only to lose their lives themselves, the unfortunate people who are dying, hiding away from all the commotion of the war and then there's the people who do return home to loved ones and friends mostly in wheelchairs, or worse. If I lose Charlie or Tommo, I just could not bear it. They're my life and my life would be gone.         I remember waking up the next day, knowing something was wrong. I couldn’t hear big Joe singing and I couldn’t smell the dinner Mrs Peaceful cooked for us on a Saturday morning. I couldn’t hear Little Tommo either. I first thought that maybe they’d all gone out for a walk. I threw on my dressing gown and went downstairs into the kitchen. Mrs Peaceful was sat at the table with her head in her hands and with tears in her eyes. I Instantly know something was wrong.   “What is it? What’s happened?” I cried.   “Molly, love, sit down.” She whispered.   “What’s happened? Is it Charlie or Tommo? Big Joe? Tell me what’s happened!” I shouted.   “I really don’t know how to say this. Before I tell you, you need to know that Joe and I are here for you. We’re all going to get through this together.”  She grabs my hands and holds them tight. I am dreading what she was going to say next. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know or not. Tears were brimming in my eyes the    “I got a letter in the post this morning. It’s from Tommo. I know this wont be easy for you when I tell you but we can get through this, I know we can. It’s Charlie. He’s been killed. I’m not sure how, or why, but I can tell you that Tommo has promised to visit soon and he will tell you    I was too numb with shock to answer. I felt like the world had stopped and I was froze forever. I couldn’t take in what she was saying. Tears were gushing down my cheeks like rain and I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to crawl away and die. I tried to shout but no words came out. I couldn’t move. I felt like the biggest part of my life had just been taken away from me.   “We can get through this love, come on we’ve got to be strong. We’ve got to be strong for Charlie. We’re a team and we’re going to take anything life throws at us,” she says.   She’s crying too then. She grabs me forward and hugs me tightly. I don’t know if I want to live anymore, I don’t know If I can survive this without Charlie.

20090220161444AAgsYje	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can anyone help me with this romeo and juliet essay?	for the main body of the essay i have to compare the two movies about romeo and juliet, one by baz lurhman   and one by franco zefferelli       here is my essay can anyone tell me how to improve it or make it longer       10 points for best answer   Why is act one scene V of Romeo and Juliet an effective piece of drama?      In this essay I will be discussing why act one scene v of Romeo and Juliet is an effective piece of drama, I will also talk about the themes and the historical and social issues represented within the play.      Romeo and Juliet is written in the 16th century by William Shakespeare, back in the 16th century fathers had the power to arrange a marriage for their daughter, they would often arrange a marriage with someone from a suitable family in order to confirm or increase the social status of their own family, it was common for girls as young as 13 to marry much older men. A marriage was also financial as money was provided money from the husband’s family which meant that if the husband were to die first the woman’s welfare would be guaranteed, people did not marry for love. The best way to improve social status was by having a large house plenty of servants and a big diner table. A ball like the one held by Capulet would be held especially for a couple to meet and to get to know each other.      There are two interpretations of the play one by Franco Zefferelli and one by Baz Lhurman. Both plays have differences and similarities, for example Zefferelli sticks to the original play written by Shakespeare and doesn’t change it in anyway, whereas Lhurman sets the play up to date and changes the play in many ways, such as when Romeo and Juliet meet, and when they die.      In both interpretations Juliet is young and beautiful but there is a difference between the two, in Zefferelli’s version Juliet she has a lot more respect for her parents and she doesn’t argue with them. She has her hair tied up all of the time but only fully grown women had to have their hair tied up, she is also covered up in clothes all of the time which is completely different to the Juliet in Lhurman’s version who is more feisty, for example when she is told that she will marry Paris on the Thursday she lashes out in anger at her parents and causes a huge argument.      In Lhurman’s interpretation pathetic fallacy is used very effectively when Romeo gets revenge on Tybalt for killing Mercuchio, just before Romeo shoots Tybalt a storm starts, which has a dramatic effect on the characters in the play and the on the audience, this is because the bad weather makes an impact on how the play looks to the audience and how the characters act, it makes the audience feel more   sympathetic for the characters.

20090220162909AAHDzvL	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help with expository paragraph?	plzz edit and add more into it      How college can be expensive.      Going to college can be expensive. College tuition and room and board can cost anywhere from $2,000 to more than $10,000 per semester, but other expenses make going to college even more expensive. For example, books typically cost between $100 and $500 each term. Materials are also very expensive. Paper, notebooks, writing utensils, and other supplies required often cost more at the college bookstore than at any local discount department store. For instance, a package of notepaper costing $2 at a discount store might cost $5 at a college bookstore. In addition, there are all kinds of special fees added onto the bill at registration time. A college student might have to pay a $50 insurance fee, a $20 activity fee, a $15 fee to the student government association and anywhere from $500 to $100 for parking. There is another fee if a student decides to add or drop classes after registration. The fees never seem to end. There is money wasted for entertaining oneself, for example going to watch movies or eating out or going to water parks in the summer with friends. College can be very expensive because of all the expenses and fees.

Thanks so much,                                             Alcohol and Tobacco Companies effect on Teens             It is unethical for alcohol and tobacco companies to market to consumers who cannot legally purchase their products and this practice needs to be banned. Alcohol and tobacco companies should not target consumers who cannot legally purchase their products. Why encourage an illegal and deadly act in American society? American teens are overwhelmed and bombarded with advertisements like theses everyday. Years ago in generations past tobacco and alcohol companies did not advertise to young people as much as they do in today’s day in age (Alcohol Opposing Viewpoints 52). Back then children would not dare pick up an alcoholic beverage or cigarette in fear of their parent’s catching them with it. That is not the case with teens today. Children years ago were scared of what their parents thought of them and their parents had more authority over them then parents to today. Back in the 1940’s and 1950’s parents were solely parents to their children where as today many parents try to become their child’s friend and forgot they are also their parent and therefore have to act and take on the responsibilities of one. There are several reasons why teenagers are not the same as they were when our parents were children. With simple research these and so many other questions can be answered.                First and foremost over the years society has made it acceptable for teens to smoke and drink at a young and younger age. Many say if it is not hurting them why is it not ok. What many do not know is both alcohol and tobacco consumption effect the body and mind of a person in many different and at times deadly ways. Parents tend to see drinking and occasional bingeing as a rite of passage rather than a deadly round of Russian roulette (Aretha 83). Cigarettes are one of the most heavily advertised products in America. Of every 100,000 fifteen-year old smokers, tobacco will prematurely kill at least 20,000 before the age of seventy (Hayley 16). The tobacco industry spends almost four billion dollars per year touting their dangerous products. Most teens view cigarettes as having freedom and sexual maturity. The best way to prevent teens from smoking, drinking and viewing it as a good thing is to shop making it attractive to teens. Teens like to act like they are someone special and dangerous. By smoking and drinking they can act out on those feelings. Tobacco and alcohol is attractive to teens because it is illegal and most teens feel like by drinking or smoking they are rebelling and going against what their parents and society wants them to do. The thought of going against what their parents, schools and society is alluring to them and makes them keep wanting to do it over and over again. Tobacco and alcohol companies rank among the top five advertisers in magazines and newspapers (Alcohol opposing Viewpoints 80). Many of these advertisements are seen everyday by under aged teens all over the world.           It has been proven the most advertised tobacco and alcohol companies have the highest sales amongst young people (Teenagers Exposed to Alcohol Ads Drink More 21-22). The more they advertise there product the more people would buy it and that includes underage teens. Some will say the use of tobacco and alcohol is part of growing up and becoming an adult but this is a lie. Many young people go through their teenage years never taking a sip of alcohol or taking one puff of a cigarette. Theses teens are very far and few between. Teens look at the use of tobacco and alcohol as a cool thing to do and a way to become like their peers and because of the impact peer pressure has on teens today (Hick 17-18).  The age when teens are taking their first drink of alcohol has become lower and lower each passing year. Alcohol consumption has even begun with children in middle school. In one study of twelfth-graders, 52% of boys reported using alcohol in the last thirdly days. 45% of twelfth-grade girls reported using alcohol in the last thirdly days (Aretha 17). Alcohol companies know teens are affected by peer pressure and a majority of those that they give the message do not smoke to will probably end up smoking just for the simple fact that they were told not to and the teen is a rebellious sort. They do just the opposite of what they are told to do. It is all about money               Another thing teens are influenced by are their parents. Even through most will say otherwise, teens do in fact look to their parents as examples and that includes when it comes to alcohol and the use of tobacco. As long as adults smoke in large numbers, teenagers around them will take up smoking and that includes teens who have parents that smoke. One UK study shows, that youths who

I want to say that MOST black people. Not all.   I live in a city where the population is mostly black and it never fails. I hear them referring themselves or others as ***** this and ***** that. Of course if I joined in the conversation (I am not black) and said that awful word I would probably be jumped.    So it's ok to disrespect and degrade amongst eachother but if non blacks do the same EXACT thing, we are in the wrong?   I don't get it.   Can you explain this to me?

Well, sometimes i person i'm kind of shy so i dont really talk to him at school but i text him a lot and one day i asked,    "Why dont we ever talk at school"    "Because whenever i walk up to you, you look away" he said.   So after that i started talking to him at school. And then, one day, i got a sheet of stickers ( really random) and i gave some to the guy he carpools with and he put them on his face. Then he asked for some and said (jokingly) he was to lazy to put them on so he asked me to put them on is face for him so i did then his ride arrived so he asked if he could have some to keep so i ripped off part of the sheet and gave them to him he said thanks and left.

20090220154105AAJzBs5	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Are people going to college/university a little too early in their lives?	From my own experience as a university student, I just get the feeling that most students, who are in the 18-22 year old bracket are not approaching their college studies they way they should be. I myself started college at the turn of my 18th year, and although I did (and have done so far) very well to get Honours consistently and although I enjoyed and was pretty well-grounded to my studies as a result of my own intrinsic motivation, I have to say that it felt very awkward to be in a place where everything that I did academically would count heavily for the future. I was still at the stage where all I wanted to do was get out on the Cricket field and hit sixes (sorry for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about here, lol).      I personally notice that many of my peers in University are, well in first year anyway, 18-19 year olds who have been forced into University by their parents. Given that they lack the intrinsic motivation to do well in school, as well as the understanding as to what their college experience will do for the rest of their lives, most of them end up performing very poorly in their courses. Their minds are too preoccupied with other things that they want to do other than college. The concept of "delayed gratification" does not resonate well with them.      Should colleges and universities start imposing a minimum age (far higher than the age of 18) to attend their institutions, as a safeguard to ensure that the thousands of dollars that are being spent on tuition fees are not being wasted (money which might not even belong to them in the first place)? How do you think this issue can be solved? It just seems as if this is a question of maturity more than anything, and finding a student at the age or 18 who truly comprehends what this experience will mean for the rest of their lives is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.       Thanks!

20090220145544AAsrgwd	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	From Community College to Ivy League.. are my dreams impossible?	OK here we go... I'm 23 years old and have wasted a good part of my life being reckless and irresponsible. I did very well in high school with a GPA above 3.5 and an ACT score of 27. I was also extremely involved in a wide range of extracurricular activities. I had one semester at the University of Kansas but withdrew. I then went to community college and withdrew from most of my classes. The classes I didn't withdraw from in time left me with two F's. The withdrawals were a result of frequent and crippling panic attacks. I have since been diagnosed with severe adult ADD, depression and anxiety disorder. I am receiving treatment and have become very ambitious and organized. I am finally in control of my life once more. I have returned to community college and am receiving very high A's in all of my classes, including a 98% in astronomy. I have never been this serious about school. I am very upset that I have wasted the last five years of my life because I know that if I had worked hard right after high school that I would not have to ask this question. I want nothing more than to become an astrophysicist or a cosmologist. I know that I will be flawless in semesters to come, with perfect attendance and a 4.0. I plan on transferring back to the University of Kansas as soon as possible. I know that I am smart enough, but are my dreams of getting into a prestigious graduate school rendered impossible by my past?

20090220145629AAqZteL	Education & Reference;Homework Help	10 POINTS BEST ANSWER- ENGLISH ESSAY PRIVATE PEACEFUL?	English Essay - Molly’s next day at home       I try not to imagine what it is like over in the trenches. I find myself constantly thinking of Charlie or Tommo lying dead in a ditch somewhere, I miss them both so terribly. Little Tommo reminds me so much of them and that’s the hard part; Yesterday, we were at dinner, all gathered round the table and he gave me this big, cheesy grin. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. He has Charlie’s ears and Tommo’s hair. Sometimes it’s great to look over and see the spitting image of Charlie or Tommo but other times it upsets me because I can't do anything and I’m terrified that the worst will happen. The many of soldiers watching people die only to lose their lives themselves, the many of people dieing, hiding away from all the commotion of the war and then there's the people who do return home to loved one's and friends mostly in wheelchairs, or worse. If I lose Charlie or Tommo, I just could not bear it. They're my life and my life would be gone.         I remember waking up the next day, knowing something was wrong. I couldn’t hear big Joe singing and I couldn’t smell the dinner Mrs Peaceful cooked for us on a Saturday morning. I couldn’t hear Little Tommo either. I first thought that maybe they’d all gone out for a walk. I threw on my dressing gown and went downstairs into the kitchen. Mrs Peaceful was sat at the table with her head in her hands and with tears in her eyes. I Instantly know something was wrong.   “What is it? What’s happened?” I cried.   “Molly, love, sit down.” She whispered.   “What’s happened? Is it Charlie or Tommo? Tell me what’s happened!” I shouted.   “I really don’t know how to say this. Before I tell you, you need to know that Joe and I are here for you. She grabs my hands and holds them tight. I got a letter in the post this morning. It’s from Tommo. I know this wont be easy for you when I tell you but it’s Charlie. He’s been killed for disobeying his sergeants orders.         What next? What should I put, can you fix any errors in spelling and change the words around if you like thanks :)

I would like to apologize for my question's lengthiness ^^;; sorry!!         Okay, so i applied to 5 University of CAs last November.    I happened to check out my application last night and i found an error T_T :   I put the wrong score for one of my AP tests. It should have been a 2 but i accidentally put a 3.    (really, an accident;i know you have to send scores later)    I consulted my college counselor but she told me to wait until i get my acceptance letter from any of them. She also said that if it was a class grade, then i would have to write to them immediately. But since it's an ap test score she said it wasn't as important.   But wouldn't it be better to inform the schools NOW, not later?    Is it bad if i notified them now, as in get rejected? lol   If i do it later won't they just have an excuse to withdraw my acceptance?          and!! btw, does a 2 on an AP test affect the chances of me getting accepted?cuz my teachers always tell the students that it's important that u take the AP class and take the AP test to show that you've tried it at least.  i got a high B in the class both semesters and had timing issues on the test -_-;          Thanks for reading!

What led to your interest in nursing?   I find it a very challenging job in a ways imaginable.     3.      Describe a challenging problem you faced on one of your clinical rotations. How did you solve the problem?           Assisting in the OR where Im expected to maintain sterility throughout the procedure.     4.      When you are experiencing a stressful work situation, how do you relax? I calm myself down in a moment and take the situation bit by bit.     5.      Give a specific example of a time when you knew you did a good job as a nurse.      It is fulfilling on my part whenever a patient would recover from specific illness then be      discharged in well condition.     6.      Have you ever been burned out? When? What did you do about it?     Yes, it was last year when I work in ICU/CUI where intense management is needed much. I tried not to exhaust myself by cooling off my mind and body.     7.      How would you respond if asked by the head nurse to do some of the menial tasks for patients that are normally not your responsibility?     I would do it. It's your responsibility to take good care of your patients. While they are still inside the hospital, they do need care. It's your responsibility to attend to their needs, in a proper and menial manner. As a person, you always have to stay humble.     8.      How would you respond if, in a rude and haughty tone, a doctor questioned your work, which you knew to be top-notch and absolutely accurate?     Id deal with him/her with manners and talk over the matter in a right place.     9.      Do you think you will be a career nurse or eventually look for another profession? Why?     Yes, for career advancement.     10.  Why did you decide to become a nurse rather than a doctor?     For practical reason, nursing job is in demand nowadays.     11.  Describe a situation in which you found yourself working with someone who was very sensitive and thin-skinned?     I am extra-sensitive to everyone. In that case, you really have to watch what you're doing and what you're gonna say. Think, a hundred times, before act. And always be ready to say sorry, in case you have to.       12.  Can you describe a situation connected with nursing that made you angry?     When your colleagues criticizes you, or call you names, just because they envy you. Or when the relatives try to do things which they think can do good to the patient. It's your liability of course you have to stop them from doing things which can be harmful for the patient. But believe me, it's really hard to stop the relatives, they would even think you are at the wrong side and that they know better.    13.  We have all tried different ways of showing consideration for others. What are some things that you have done in this respect?     By giving due respect to patient, administering medications on time, handling patient with care establishing patient with care, specially to the relatives of a dying patient, you have to show consideration to their feelings as well as your patients. You have to show empathy. Think as if you were in their place. Give them privacy. And if you have to do some tasks, tell them in a humble, low-toned voice, and in a proper manner.    14.  What are some ways that you feel that nursing can become more professional?     Scrub suits or Nursing uniforms should be made officially for nurses only. Nowadays, I can see janitors, baby-sitters and maids wearing it. Somehow, as a nurse, I perceive it as degrading.     15.  If you were told that the nursing field was closed and that you could not become a nurse, what would your do?     Try other field. Find a way. There are always alternative ways to pursue my career. If not here, I can try other countries.     16.  What types of colleague do you least like to work with?     Pessimistic, the lazy ones, they also seem to be non-efficient, the ones who talks a lot and does nothing. I might as well work alone.     17.  What type of nursing tasks do you find most objectionable?     Nothing in specific. It's more on finding the tasks nurses aren't allowed to do, just because they are "just nurses", objectionable.  18.  Describe a situation connected with nursing that you experienced in the last year that made you angry.     When my mom questioned me. Why can't I work "not" as a volunteer? I don't think she understands. It's hard to find a nursing job in this country!! Neither can I go abroad, I still need 2 years of hospital experience.    19.  How many years do you see yourself staying with this hospital?     As long as Im happy with the work environment.     20.  How do you go about making a decision?     I seek wisdom from God and consult my mother.
