qbmkMWqeaa	No, the mystery gift is for nintendo events such as the one starting today at Toys R Us.  When you go to TRU you click on Mystery Gift and download a special pokemon wonder card.  Then you go to any pokemart and talk to the delivery guy who will give you the pokemon.<br>  <br>  This month it's a Regigigas you can get from Toys R Us.<br>  <br>  The guy tells you to watch the tv because they do special reports about the player and give you other information such as when there are swarms of pokemon you can catch, etc.<br>  <br>  No, currently there is no way to get an Azure Flute other than through a Pokemon event.<br>  <br>  "So far, this item has never been distributed officially anywhere in the world, even in Japan, and as such is only available by use of cheating or hacking."|`|Sofk2yO8aa	yes, your mystery gift is herpes|`|eb6038b63b522b4782eede8c364b6089aa	You have to answer the guy asking questions in the TV studio 2nd floor the right things to get Mystery Gift to appear on your start menu. First tell him "EVERYONE HAPPY" then "WIFI CONNECTION" and when you restart the game it will appear on your start menu. It's only good for Official Nintendo Download Events they usually do at Toys R Us, like level 100 Regigigas that will make the other Regi show up in Sinnoh when sent into the Platinum version releasing on March 22, is available until March 21st. I think the Azure Flute thing is wrong, I think you get a Trophy or something for the 50 streak.|`|ZZTIJLQGaa	Do this to get mystery gift:1) Go to the Jubilife TV station in Jubilife City.<br>  2) Go to the 3rd floor.<br>  3) Talk to the man in the lower room (he’s on the left).<br>  4) The first two words you tell him are “everyone” and “happy“.<br>  5) the second two words are “Wi-Fi” and “Connection“.<br>  6) This will then unlock the Mystery Gift feature on the main menu<br>  <br>  My record at the battle tower is 57 and I didn't get the azure flute.

Pig out in the parking lot on high energy foods like trail mix, peanut butter crackers, honey roasted peanuts, candy bars, and lot of water, then enter the park as soon as it opens.  Head straight to the most thrilling rides, then work your way down.  If you had the time of your life before the lines get too long, just go home and declare the day as being a success.  Otherwise, suffer with the longer lines or go back to your car during the busiest times (1 to 5 pm?) and snack some more before going back in.  Saturdays are the busiest days, while Fridays and Sundays are less busy and weekdays are even less busy, but going on a Saturday in April/May or October/November is a lot less busy than going on a Saturday from June through September.  April/May and October/November are the months we favor, and we try to find other things to do during the other months.  We are total thrill junkies, and these are the things that work for us.
AA10433514	Kings Island has a many great rides and attractions.  I recommend the following:<br>  <br>  Roller Coasters<br>  <br>  Invertigo - One of the best hang and bangs out there.<br>  Flight Deck - Great ride, just too short.<br>  Adventure Express - One of the best mine train rides I've ridden.<br>  Racer - What a classic ride, always a treat to ride.<br>  Flight of Fear - Great LIM launched coaster.<br>  FireHawk - One of the best Vekoma flying coasters out there.<br>  Vortex - One of the best Arrow looping coasters out there.<br>  Backlot Stunt Coaster - Ok, but it's more of a kid's coaster.<br>  Runaway Reptar - Great Kid's coaster, I ride it all the time.<br>  Avatar - Great shuttle coaster, great for us big kids as well.<br>  Fairly Odd Coaster - The only thing I hate about this ride is the name.<br>  The Beast - 30 years later, and still going strong.  Once of my favorite woodies!<br>  The only one I normally don't ride is Son of Beast - It is just too rough!<br>  <br>  Flat Rides<br>  <br>  Drop Tower - One of the best drop rides out there.  Takes my stomach every time I ride it.<br>  Delirium - All I can say is WOW everytime I ride this.<br>  Monster - One of my favorites<br>  Scrambler - Also one of my favorites<br>  Shake Rattle & Roll - I have to ride this one every time I visit the park.  I have rode many of these but Kings Island's is the best.<br>  The Crypt - Although I liked this much better as Tomb Raider, it is still a good ride.  Just wish the themeing was better.<br>  Viking Fury - A must ride, ride gets my stomach every time.  Ride in the very back / front.<br>  Sling Shot - What a great ride, just hate paying the upcharge to do it.|`|Zo0QMB8xaa	roller coasters & water rides|`|popRBGHUaa	Go to the web site, check out their "max thrill" rides, and make a list of their rides starting with the most daring and working your way down.  Arrive at the park before opening time and pig out in the parking lot on foods that will fill you up while providing enough energy to get you through the first few hours.  We tend to throw down a lot of trail mix, honey roasted peanuts, peanut butter crackers, possibly some candy, and a lot of bottled water.  (Once you get in the park, the food won't be cheap, it won't be as healthy, and it might make you sick.)  Enter the park at opening time, and head straight to the most daring ride, then work your way down.  That's a very good way of having the most thrills before the lines get too long.  If you want to spend the entire day there, take a break between 1 and 5 pm, give or take, since those are the busiest times.  Go back to the car to enjoy some more munchies, then return to the park after the lines get shorter.  If you already had the time of your life before the lines get long and you don't want to wait around for the lines to get shorter again, just go home with the satisfaction that the day was a success.  We don't mind waiting up to a half hour for a good ride, but we don't want to waste our entire day waiting in line for the rides.  Therefore, we do the "get there early" thing, go in the early spring and fall, and avoid the parks like the plague during the busy summer months.  During the summer, we go to smaller events like firemens' field days, festivals, county fairs, state fairs, smaller amusement parks, etc. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|mSWkvXneaa	I went there last year and my favorite rides were Firehawk, Backlot Stunt Coaster, and Flight of Fear, the indoor one. There is a new ride opening this April, too, that looks pretty awesome.  It's called Diamondback.  Beast and Son of Beast were huge, and at times fun, but they were EXTREMELY rough.  Son of Beast was worse, but there was one turn on the Beast that cracked my neck and I was sore for 2 days, so be careful!<br>  <br>  Have a great time :-)
AA12389198	First, you have to become good friends with one of your neighbors in your apartment complex. Typically that is Daily relationship 70+. Then have the adult and teenager Sims walk, carpool, or drive to a community lot. If you have younger Sims, the game will give you a warning that you need a Nanny. Then it will ask if you would like to have someone stay home, hire a nanny, or it will say ask.... ____.

Money, your wallet, a hard case for eyeglasses (if needed), and little else.  If you want to smuggle in some trail mix or honey roasted peanuts and hope you don't get caught, do that too.  When we go to amusement parks, we usually pig out on trail mix, peanut butter crackers, honey roasted peanuts, and bottled water before we enter the park, then try to get by on free water at drinking fountains in the park when needed.  Food at amusement parks is usually too expensive and the types of food that will make you sick when you get on the rides.  Yuck.  At Six Flags in New Jersey, there are some rides where they won't let you carry a fanny pack, so we simply stuffed our pockets instead of carrying a fanny pack.<br>  <br>  As for the rides, do your research.  Go to the web site, check out the "max thrill" rides, and make a list starting with the most daring ones and working your way down.  Enter the park as soon as it opens, and go on the rides in that order to get max thrills with minimum waiting time.  Don't trust other people's opinions when it comes to which rides your should ride in which order...just go to the web site and figure out which rides are best for YOU.  <br>  <br>  We haven't been to Kennywood yet, but that will happen in May during an amusement park tour that will include Cedar Point and King's Island.  We've been to a lot of amusement parks, we always do what I mentioned, and it always works for us.  Hopefully it will work for you, too.|`|xJqg0DFSaa	bring cash eat at potato patch right by the turtles ride everything especially the jackrabbit and phantoms revenge just go to whatever ride has the shortest wait the lines don't take as long as they look especially on the racer any other questions email me because theres a lot more

m8f7rnBEaa	It is really a type of card game.  It is Asian in origin.  Instead of using a deck of playing cards, it uses "tiles", which are about the size of 2 dominoes glued together.  The tiles can be larger or smaller depending on the set you buy. A good mahjong set will cost in the vicinity of $100.00.  The game is best if 4 players are involved, but as few as 2 can play.  The tiles are imprinted with suits and values, much like a deck of cards.  For example, you could be holding a 7 of spades in poker or in mahjong you could be holding 7 "sticks", where sticks is one of the suits, just like spades is a suit in a deck of cards.  The objective is to make matches with the tiles in a manner that is similar to gin rummy.  The first person to make enough matches to discard all of their tiles is the winner.  There are various versions of the game.  I am used to the Filippino version, which uses 3 suits - character, stick and ball, all other tiles being throwaways called "flowers".  The game is often used for gambling.  There is a points system where certain types of hands or matches will be worth more or less money.  Like poker. the $$$ amounts can be varied.  When I have played for money, it's usually quarters, dimes and nickels.  Serious games go much, much higher.|`|AA11968008	Everything you need to know about Mah Jong is here: <a href="http://www.sloperama.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sloperama.com/</a>|`|9797TRA2aa	Its a game of four players. No more no less. You basically have to make a pattern with the pieces you have, and every turn you must take a new piece and throw away a piece. You should always have 13 pieces. Once you made a pattern you win. There are many different patterns you can use to win. It's not that difficult once you get to know the game, it's quite simple, all you need to know if how to make a pattern to win.

irFvDZmNaa	If you are looking for the max, try my method for finding the max, and then try to mimic it to find your max. <br>  <br>  Ok! First go to your Y= button, and type in this equation.    -X^2 +3<br>  <br>  That reads negative X squared + 3. <br>  <br>  After typing that into the y= button, press the "2nd" button. <br>  <br>  Then, after pressing the "2nd" button, press the "CALC" button. If you do this, you will then find a list of numbers to press. Read the list, and the MAXIMUM should be number 4. Press 4, or use your arrows to go to 4, and hit enter. <br>  <br>  If you do this, you will see that your maximum point is blinking on your screen. However, I believe they will only find the maximum point depending on what is shown on the screen. Therefore, be sure to set your windows such that it allows the full behavior of your function to show up on the graph. <br>  <br>  Now that you've tried my function, go ahead and see if you can get your function to show its maximum.

A few years ago I visited Disneyland, and I decided to try the Tower of Terror.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but the ride gave me a fear of elevators that go fast up and down.|`|xvT1rqasaa	spiders.|`|popRBGHUaa	I'm 45, and my biggest fear is heights.  Walking on the roof of a 4 story building scares the crap out of me, as does walking on my porch roof, but airplanes and the tallest roller coasters in the world don't scare me.  The safety factor is a major consideration.  I still get nervous on drop rides when I have the opportunity to look down, and the same thing happens with rides like the Condor, but I am working on those things.  They are just rides, ya know?  Safe as safe can be, without needing to worry about splatting on the ground.  My girlfriend doesn't like elevators that have a lot of glass, but I enjoyed that today.  Elevators without glass aren't a problem at all because we can't see how high we are.  We still have to conquer the drop rides and the Condor, but we are especially looking forward to helicopter rides, hot air balloons, sky diving, bungee jumping, and other "safe" thrills.|`|31v7TjzFaa	Are you talking about biggest fear on rides yeah?<br>  <br>  My biggest fear is waiting for something big to happen, like a free fall or sudden acceleration. I've been on a 100 metre free fall which felt soooooo high and it was so scary waiting up there, felt like ages! Waiting in the que is usualy the worst bit though! I waited ages to que up for a ride that shoots you 0-80 in 2 seconds, and I was terrified! I've noticed when I hardly have to wait I don't even have time to think or worry and I enjoy it much more. It's usualy worth it in the end, and knowing you went on it is great too. It's a natural feeling to be scared, especially when your in a dangerous situation like being up so high and going so fast.

Tight, meaning, at a full table you should be playing only around 20% of your hands.  Be very picky about what hands you elect to play from early position (one of the first to act) and loosen up slightly as you get closer to the button.  Be aggressive, when you enter a pot, you are: "in it to win it".  Don't be reckless, but since you are playing tight, you are entering with stronger cards, have a tight table image and respect from the table, hopefully have position & from all this, a lot of leverage.  <br>  <br>  Also, related to this is the "Gap Concept".  It states that you need a better hand to call a raise with then if you were making the raise yourself.  An example is that you are in middle position (one of the middle players to act) and you have KQ suited.  If someone raises before you, you should throw this hand away, because someone has shown strength and you need a stronger hand than normal to compensate for this.  If the raiser is loose, you can lower your standards.  If the raiser is tighter than normal, you'll need to raise your standards for that position dramatically.|`|S0oNR4xNaa	Play only Ace or King or jack or Q hole cards even play some pocket pairs . dont play the hand like<br>  2 7<br>  2 6, 2 8, 2 9, 2 5<br>  3 6 ,3 7, 3 8,3 9<br>  4 8,4 7,49<br>  5 9,<br>  6 9,<br>  J 2,J 3 or high card and a low card.<br>  <br>  becarefull with low pocket pairs like 22,33 ....|`|J5e1L2sBaa	I actually bought a guide off the internet a few months ago.

sGqLX1y9aa	I really think you should get resistance before you buy the second one because if your like me, I like to get the full story in any game I play. Resistance Fall of Man is a really great game with good graphics and easy to learn controls, but then again I really think that Killzone 2 would be more worth your money.|`|TkNv5hGTaa	Yes its different than Killzone 2, therefore they are both fun in different ways. Killzone 2 is more realistic, Resistance more Haloish. Get Killzone 2 first or get Resistance if you want to spend less money. Whichever you want, because Killzone 2 costs $60 so your choice. Right now, I'm playing Killzone 2 because it just came out though.

43zXRpLYaa	You can get a 1 day/1 park pass, a free birthday Fast Pass good for up to 5 friends, or you can get a Birthday fun card to spend equal to the amount of the ticket. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyparks/en_US/WhatWillYouCelebrate/disneyland/index?name=CelebrationsDLRFreeOnYourBirthdayPage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disneyp...</a><br>  ? A birthday FASTPASS? exchange card+ for a certain number attractions at both Disneyland? Park and Disney's California Adventure? Park; or<br>  ? A birthday fun card in an amount equal to the price of a 1-Day/I1-Park ticket** for certain purchases including select merchandise, tour experiences or for Disney's PhotoPass? on-site services at participating locations at Disneyland? Resort: or<br>  ? A 1-Day/1-Park ticket for you to use any time until your next birthday.<br>  <br>  They give you a ticket that says "Resident 2fer Ticket" and at the bottom they have you sign it with your name. It says "Birthday Celebrant" and you sign above that. The thing is you have to give them ID to show it's your birthday. They put that info into the computer. If you already have an annual pass, you will be in the computer already. <br>  <br>  The only person who can get a free ticket is the person who is having the birthday.|`|AA10214265	As others have stated, the Free Admission on Your Birthday ticket can only be used by the birthday celebrant (provided your Annual Pass is not blocked out that day). You would only receive the 2fer ticket if you are a Southern California resident.<br>  <br>  -- BUT --<br>  <br>  Some Annual Passholders have accepted the Fun Card instead of the Birthday Ticket Good for a Year, and used the Fun Card to buy admission for a friend.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	Your teacher is wrong.<br>  <br>  If you have an AP that is NOT blocked out on your birthday, you have the choice of ONE alternate gift.   These include a Gift Card equivalent to a 1-Day 1-Park admission, a set of Birthday Fastpasses, or a free ticket to be used within a year.  The gift card can be used at various stores at the Disneyland resort but can not be used for tickets.  The free ticket is good for up to 1 year and usable only by the Birthday person.  This ticket is non-transferable as it does have the name of the AP holder on it.<br>  <br>  If you have an Annual Pass pass that is blocked out on your Birthday you get the free admission.  But since you got the free admission you are unable to get any of the alternate gifts.

6N3yjlXhaa	Brother or Babylock.<br>  <br>  Brother makes most of the Bernina embroidery machines, but they are more expensive.<br>  <br>  I have both Brother & Babylock.  They are easy to use and compatible with other brands of machine embroidery software.<br>  <br>  To make life easier, select a machine that has USB connectivity and a hooping area for stitching at least 5 x 7 designs.<br>  <br>  There will be built-in designs, but you will want more.  The most economical way to obtain additional designs is via Internet downloads.<br>  <br>  Some companies that sell on the Internet also have free designs you can download.  Embroidery machine companies also have designs for sale and free downloads.<br>  <br>  Without USB connectivity, you will need to purchase a machine embroidery reader/writer box and rewritable card.  $120 and up.<br>  <br>  USB connectivity can be Port A, which is a cable that connects the embroidery machine to the PC - you only need to be connected to send the designs from the PC to the embroidery machine.  <br>  <br>  Or, Port B, which is a removable flash drive (flash stick, media stick - you can get them cheap at Radio Shack and office supply stores).<br>  <br>  Supplies for machine embroidery can add up.  You need stabilizers, embroidery needles, embroidery thread and machine embroidery bobbin thread.<br>  <br>  I keep stocked up when JoAnn has Sulky thread for 50% off.  <br>  <br>  On-line stores, ShoppersRule and Allbrands have good prices on thread, needles and stabilizers.  SR also has t-shirts, sweatshirts and several other items for embroidery, referred to as "blanks".<br>  <br>  This is a great site for techniques & tips - <a href="http://www.emblibrary.com/EL/elprojects/holder.aspx?page=techniques" rel="nofollow">http://www.emblibrary.com/EL/elprojects/...</a>|`|rnfxNYx3aa	What is your price range?  I have the newest Brother that ran me 6K so without knowing what you can afford it is hard to say that 6K machine is what you want.|`|Qs7bxM7Saa	I purchased a used (one time only) Bernina Deco 650 and I love it! As others have replied, more supplies are needed - If your machine isn't already USB compatible, you'll need a reader with a card (about $199 at Allbrands), thread, stabilizers, needles and designs. I think I'll need to get a 2nd job to pay for my 'habit'.<br>  <br>  After using my Deco for about 2 weeks I can see that I want to upgrade already. The stitching area is limited to 4x4 and I want to embroider larger designs without alot of rehooping. I will be purchasing a Hoop-it-all 10 x 10 which costs about $260.<br>  <br>  Check out your local sewing machine store to see if there any refurbished machines. They should lend support and you'll get your new hobby going with less investment.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I know you will LOVE machine embroidery!|`|fdcbc546e5c9d8bf5f0cdc4246767fecaa	My first and I still have is a"Husqvarna Designer 1"  at this time they are reasonably priced, now.  They have some higher but I have 2 of the designers and would not change.  They use the 3 1/2 in disks and after you use them they can be reformatted and reused.<br>  <br>  You can go on the Husqvarna site to look at them.|`|q0HVCvqMaa	Personally I don't like the Brother machine unless you get one of the more expensive ones. I have a Husqvarna Designer S.E. and really like that (I bought it used and that helped the $$). My opinion is that there is more to buy than just the sewing machine such as the reader card, the memory card or stick etc. so be sure to ask about that too.<br>  Happy shopping.|`|N7VTMrAuaa	PATTI ANN HAD GOOD ADVICE, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND IT IS AN EXPENSIVE HOBBY BUT LOTS OF FUN. I WOULD BUY THE MOST EXPENSIVE MACHINE I COULD AFFORD EVEN IF IT HAS FEATURES YOU DON'T THINK YOU'LL WANT BECAUSE YOU WILL  LATER. A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS TO PICK THE ONE YOU WANT AND THEN BUY THE NEXT HIGHER MODEL UP BECAUSE YOU WILL WANT THE FEATURES IT OFFERS, THEY DO TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE SO MEASURE YOUR SPACE TOO.

He should also realize that there is risk in bringing a game to another persons house, and unless you put a LOT of pressure on him to bring that game he should know that it could of gotten broken if you stepped on it or something.<br>  <br>  Game systems don't "break" games that's simply impossibly, I don't know a whole lot about allot of stuff, but I know tech stuff. <br>  <br>  It would of been possible that it messed it up if the Xbox360 was defective, but if it was unreadable as soon as you popped it in, then the disk was already broken. <br>  <br>  I think he knew this, and is trying to get his game replaced for free.<br>  <br>  Get a different friend!|`|L8rVpny7aa	well theres 2 ways out of this<br>  1) tell him that its his problem not yours, hes the one that was responsible for it and he put it in your xbox so its his problem that it messed up.<br>  2) find another friend that has a gamefly or blockbuster rented version and switch the disks.|`|mrucGLykaa	its his fault, tell him HE put in the game, and HE needs to be able to take care of his games|`|Rdm5Nl4Raa	Tell him to f*** himself|`|gu3x37Muaa	His game was probably already scratched and would have broked in his Xbox 360 too.

If it getting in the way of playing then send it back and get another, if it does the same then it's supposed to ... probably. It's isn't the console itself? It only does it on that game?<br>  <br>  Have a look at the manual for the game. The 'controls' area might tell you.

However, another way to do it is: click on start, then click on 'run...', and type in 'regedit' and press OK. Next, you want to click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then SOFTWARE, then Electronic Arts, and then EA Games, then Spore(TM), and below is ergc. Click on it, and viola!

XX0ac9iRaa	If it was one of her fears to have a baby (if she is a romance or pleasureseeker sim for example) then that would explain why she is furious with him. Also if he was having a relationship with another sim they sometimes find out for apparently no reason at all.<br>  Apart from that, I can't think of anything. At least being furious with him isn't the end of the world, you can still keep your relationship up with a bit more effort and it will only last for a few days.

WEaoTNQAaa	I would go with the Xbox. They just cut the price, so it is relatively cheap now, in comparison to the PS3. Also, you don't necessarily have to pay for Live for a whole year. You can take it month by month, which is about 8 dollars. However, the yearly payment for Xbox live is slightly cheaper than the month by month, on the whole. Also, Xbox has some of the best games like Call of Duty and Halo.|`|GsZhp6h4aa	xbox live for a year is $50. get your facts straight man. Right now you seem to be edging toward ps3. It really comes down to which types of games you wanna play. If you think you are going to be playing shooting games or online games more, get a 360. if u like rpg's and such, get a ps3.|`|RPRJ9yabaa	Get a ps3!! way better!!<br>  <br>  <br>  whoever has one add me... mooselove94,<br>  <br>  X)|`|TvwxvhMxaa	NOTE: I answered this question before, so I am restating the facts about each system.<br>  <br>  On the monthly gaming, it just depends on what system you'll like more, and if you play a lot of games online, then i would say go with the system that most of your friends play on so you can all have fun together.<br>  <br>  Its really all on preference and how much you're willing to pay. If price is no object, but you can only get one, overall the PS3 has much better graphics and its a blue ray DVD player to boot. But the graphic quality of the PS3 is only good if you have a high definition TV to play it on. If you just plug the PS3 into any old plain TV it won't look very special. Still good quality, but none of the Pazazz you'd get. Also, the PS3 has different versions which offer and do not offer backwards compatibility, meaning of course you wouldn't be able to play your ol' PS2 games on it. Although its not that big of a deal since you already have a PS2, but its something to note.<br>  <br>  The 360 looks great for any TV you would play on, and it is always constantly having updates such as there has been an update downloading for free that updates your entire dashboard and allows you to create an avatar character like the Wii system, its not important but its cute; especially if you play online. The 360 also overall has a bit more variety of games as opposed to the PS3, I know this because I have gotten more games for the 360 over the PS3, although many would argue, the PS3 when it does, has amazing games released for it. While the 360 just has more numerous games.<br>  <br>  Many games that are released already are available for both consoles so its not the big a deal. Its just what you want out of a game.<br>  <br>  If you want to play games that have shocking graphics and visual aspects I personally recommend the PS3, but only if you have or willing to get a High Def TV. The games are very well made, and overall the PS3's graphics are just amazing compared to the 360.<br>  <br>  The 360 while it's graphics aren't as good as the PS3's are nothing to ignore. The detail is still very well shown, and it doesn't even require you to have a high def TV. It will of course help, but the 360 doesn't need the boost and still looks fine. The PS3 doesn't have its Zah over the 360 without the High Def TV.<br>  <br>  Price wise they're both about the same given the capabilities of each system.<br>  <br>  The choice is up to you!<br>  <br>  PS: If you don't have a High Def TV I recommend the 360 because graphic wise then they're the pretty much the same.|`|GLH7w1eiaa	totally a PS3 buddy its worth it cuz <br>    PS3 <br>  - Blu - ray player <br>  - HDD<br>  - PC WI-FI built in <br>  -  full 1080 P<br>  - Free multiplayer<br>  dont get 360 becuz <br>  - Breaks down very easy  <br>   <br>  i condvince alot of friend to get PS3 and liked <br>  it and bought it i havent touch my x-box pro sine last year <br>  infact i sold it for $400 with Halo 3 and a controller <br>  so PS3 is totally the better buy ! <br>  - HD DVD sucks <br>  - HDD only  microsoft hard drive <br>  - copy PS3 on HDMI <br>  - paying for live|`|TbderdPnaa	honestly it's up to you. ps3 has blu-ray and it's free online but it cost more for the system.  i own a ps3 and i love it.  it is the greatest gaming system i have ever owned and why would the government buy 400 ps3's when they first came out to use for our military look it up it is true.|`|7r9kQwNraa	I have both... and personally i like the ps3 better....<br>  <br>  But it all depends on you... The things u have to ask yourself are...<br>  <br>  - What kind of exclusives could i get for both consoles <br>  ex.... halo 3, metal gear solid etc.<br>  <br>  - Am i going to watch blu-ray movies?<br>  <br>  - Am i going to play online?.....Just to give u a headsup... Xbox 360 doesn't have wi-fi so u have to connect it with a laptop...computer...modem etc..<br>  <br>  Unlike the ps3 which all u need to do is type in a code which is a piece of cake :D|`|WffacvvTaa	U should buy ps3 because it has blu-ray, free online, faster processor, doesn't scratch the games, u can upgrade hdd to 600 gb. Xbox 360 break more often. I just bought ps3 and i love it!!!!!

c5ScseTdaa	There are plenty of sites where you can download the Sims 2 for free, or at least something that purports to be the Sims 2.  You're likely to get some buggy copy bundled with malware instead of the real deal.<br>  <br>  The most efficient method of downloading such a thing is to use a torrent, but that generally requires installing a torrent client.  Some, such as μTorrent, can run while not technically installed.<br>  <br>  As of now (and probably forever) there's no legal free download of the Sims 2.  You're taking your chances wherever you decide to pirate it.  The good news is that Sims 3 is due soon, which will force the price of the Sims 2 down dramatically!|`|MrSWOrEbaa	If you want Sims 3 to be as successful as Sims 2 (EA is heading toward bankruptcy, they're relying heavily on Sims 3 to boost sales) , buy it.

Galactic Battlegrounds is just a star wars themed Age of Empires, but personally i think its way better.  I never really thought I'd like WOW, but after my friends finally drove me into getting it I was glad because its mad fun.  And Tribal Wars is a mmorpg on the interent, (www.triablwars.net), and its a lot of fun, but just like many other rpg's you have to devote a lot of time to it.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	Rise of Nations, imo, was one of the best RTS games ever.

KHSOVxViaa	Gameplay first, though nicer graphics are better than not.<br>  <br>  I get bored quickly with shallow games no matter how pretty, while a clever game will keep me enthralled irrespective of graphics.  It depends on the game though - good graphics can enhance a sense of realism in a simulation, while more symbolic graphics are quite acceptable for a strategy game.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW I just tried to answer your question on vector & raster graphics, but you deleted it before I could post!  You are quite correct - vector graphics came first (oscilloscope technology) and raster graphics didn't widely appear 'til early 70s.  First games console was the Magnavox Oddyssey.|`|BB4Qd9ymaa	gameplay, but graphics are important.<br>  The gameplay is what makes the game.<br>  The graphics of course, are what give the game the look it has.<br>  I would never buy a game just because of the graphics. it has to be fun.|`|wNa9I3BTaa	Graphics and cutscenes all the way.

xjZKpXTTaa	To select PalPark pokemon, you need to first put your Leaf Green game into the GBA part of the DS.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Take the Pokemon you want to trade to the Move Deleter and Delete any HMs that the Pokemon has. If it has an HM, you won't be able to migrate it.<br>  Step 2: Put the said Pokemon into the PC and save the GBA game before turning off the DS<br>  Step 3: You keep the GBA game in the GBA slot and put your Pearl game into the DS slot<br>  Step 4: Turn on the DS and select Pokemon Pearl<br>  Step 5: At the title screen, there will be an option saying 'Migrate Pokemon'<br>  Step 6: Chose the said option and then select the Pokemon you want to migrate.<br>  Step 7: After choosing your 6 Pokemon, go to the Pal Park and search for them. ((IMPORTANT NOTE: I would suggest going onto my source site and research the locations of the Pokemon you are migrating. Each Pokemon has a different area in the Pal Park, like some water types will be in the ocean area, and some will be in the lake area, and others in the pond area. You must research all of the places in order to find the Pokemon before the 24 hour time limit is up and they disappear!))<br>  <br>  Have fun migrating!|`|yztaT9Kxaa	You first need to have gotten the national dex in your diamond/pearl version.  Go to pal park and save.  Turn the game off then on.  on the menu screen there will be an option that says "Transfer pokemon from Leafgreen."  Select that and say yes to all the questions.  Now it will show all the pokemon in the PC on your leafgreen version.  ONLY pokemon in the PC will be able to transfer.  After you have selected six talk to the guy at the counter in pal park and enter the field.  The pokemon will appear in the area that best fits their charactristics.  Like rock types will appear in the mountain area etc.  The park balls work like masterballs so don't worry.|`|2mnCa6lqaa	First you got to beat the game before your able to go to the pal park next you must complete the shinnoh region dex. last but not least go to ur leaf green put the pokemon u want to transfer into the pc box and then go back to ur pearl.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Edit:You also have to see every Pokemon in the Pre sinnoh dex.<br>  <br>  Put leafgreen in your DS along with Diamond/Pearl/Platinum.When the menu for your game comes up.instead of selecting continue...hit migrate from_______.Then,select the Pokemon you want..make sure they don't know any HM moves.Then,when done..go to Pal park and catch your Pokemon.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	First beat the champ and get the national dex. Then you insert a GBA game. On the games main menu it will say "Migrate from XXXXXX". You use the touch screen to select the 6 pokemon.

I speak with my older brother and tell him that we can play Co-op games with XBox, and make use of it for our Holidays, he agreed and he spoke with my dad and then, "OK" GRANTED!!!

jAhFXjfdaa	Huh. Don't be too rude to ask for money. Just buy another one by saving up. Maybe your friends is old, and almost over the warranty is what I'm thinking. Can't imagine about the black marks though.|`|wNa9I3BTaa	If the box tore it up it doesn't sound too friendly to make him pay for it. I'm sure if he knew he wouldn't have let you put it in, but chances are he didn't. I'm still in wonder about the black marks though...Couldn't imagine how that happened...|`|AA12206331	It's probably your friends xbox that scratched your disc, especially if the scratches are circular.  My first xbox did this to my cod4 disc and when I sent it in to microsoft they gave me a new one but a refurbished xbox that broke a year later with the rrod.  Just tell him to call microsoft at 1-800-4MY-XBOX and they will help you!

iskFlGOmaa	"/userandom [mount 1], [mount 2], [mount 3]" etc...<br>  <br>  of course, if you load flying mounts into this macro, then when you are in a place that can't use them, you'll get an error message, and it will go to one of the mounts that are available.  I used to have a macro that didn't display the error message, but I forgot the deliminator to do it

IwICZKL8aa	If your going to trade in man i suggest you sell it on ebay or craigslist because honestly i think gamestop is a ripoff if ur returning , trading ect..

You'd get less than half of what you paid for it, no matter how good the condition of it is. And I highly doubt that you would be able to just trade all this for a PS3 because it's still rather expensive.

You can tell her you won't do anything wrong on the game, you won't be mean, a jerk, anything! If all else fails you mom can have a parent account. With a parent account she can be e-mailed telling her what you did, if you were reported, what you talked about with others. Last one is optional, don't worry. All this can help you!|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Typical teenager attitude. We all go through it. Nothing else in the world matters, beyond your own wants/needs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Instead of going with absolutes, why not try to compromise with your mother? Instead of fighting and putting her back against the wall, which it is when you disobay her, she is your parent after all, why not simply say "Ok, mom, I understand you have fears. I think I've handled the content for the past 4 years without letting it get in the way of real life (this should be a true statement!). But if you want me to stop playing, can we come to a compromise? Maybe instead of playing on weekdays, I can limit it to just weekends?"<br>  <br>  The point of all this is to get you to stop arguing like a child and start acting like a young adult. You'll find many things in life that prevent you from doing what you want to.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	First off are you playing Alliance or Horde? What class, if a priest you have a solid case to bring.

I used to play WoW and it became more than just a part of life.  It kind of consumed it.

wkceLdVxaa	Sonic fans are....Insane. That's probably the closest thing your gonna get to an actual answer.  <br>  <br>  They have never been the types of fans that like "change". And they are whiney about it too.  They whine when a new character is introduced, when someone has their own game (cough)Shadow(cough). They whine when sonic is too slow, Then they whine because he's too fast.<br>  <br>  Another huge factor: Jason Griffith is with 4kids Tv. The station that ruins/ americanizes all anime.<br>  The funny thing is i personally like Griffith's voice better than Drummond's. (Drummond sounded like a brick was shoved up his nose XD)<br>  <br>  I think Griffith has gotten a heck of alot better since the first episode  of sonic X.|`|ltdJj8XFaa	I have no idea myself.

JUWzOTTiaa	Houses install using the game installer, so that means your manual downloads aren't working for some reason. This makes me think that either they are being put in the wrong directory, which has to be My Documents/EA Games/The Sims 2/Downloads (not program files, which was a mistake I made) and you have to make sure you spell Downloads with a capital D.<br>  You have to also restart your game 2 or 3 times to activate custom content if you haven't tried that.<br>  Another thought-Maybe the files are still zipped? Maybe your friend unzipped them and maybe you forgot to?|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Well, the box that says, "Enable Custom Content" doesn't actually have to show up and you can still see your custom content.  But I have a feeling that it does having something to do with it in your case.<br>  <br>  When you do go into the options, first there should be something that says Show Custom Content in the Catalogs.  Make sure this is marked to show it.<br>  <br>  To the right of that you should see something about showing a dialog box on start up.  Normally this is "enabled" by default.  I actually always disable mine cause I can't stand it when I'm trying to load the game and it stops at that screen.<br>  <br>  Below that, you'll see a white star.  Click on that star.  Now you will see "Enable Custom Content" and there should be a tick mark in the little circle.  If there isn't one there, click on it to put one there.  Now exit your game so this change can take effect.  Go back in to your game and see if you can now find the custom content.<br>  <br>  If not, then here is a guide that will help you try to figure out why you're not seeing it in your game.  Some games are just weird and need "extra" help to get the things to show up.  It's a really long guide, but just start at the beginning and try everything they tell you to try.  By the time you are done, you should be able to have your cc in your game.

T5DbLLgQaa	It depends on how large each of the color areas are and how close the areas that are sewn in the same color are from each other. If you are sewing a kit where all the threads are pre-sorted and pre-cut, you have to be very careful and NOT to waste any of the threads so that there are enough threads for you to complete the whole thing. This means obviously being meticulous, and that takes time. I never ever hurry myself with ANY of my cross-stitch works, so this kind of hobby teaches patience very well!! It takes the time it takes to sew an item, and that's all about it!! Please do not let a challenging item to let you down, it will definitely be a rewarding thing to finish it after all!! Good luck, I'm sure you will make it!!|`|154dzJ1Faa	As with any large project, they are all completed one step at a time. In this case, one stitch at a time.  Slowly, surely, and methodically.  It can be daunting when you look at all that is to be done, but that is never a good thing to do.  Look at how far you have come!  And know that it will get finished one day.  If you need instant gratification (and we all do), have some smaller projects you can do quickly, while working on the large one at the same time.  I do that a lot, and so do many others.  The large one is going to take time.. we all know that, there is no deadline, you work on it when you can, little by little, and it will get done.  In the meantime, you have other things completed as well.  The joy is not in the finishing -- it is in the doing.  Some people actually remove some stitching, to re-do them -- and to make the project last a bit longer.<br>  <br>  If you want quick finishing, get large size plastic canvas, and thick acrylic yarn... you will be done in an hour or so.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	Doing one line at a time is how you do tapestry and won't work for cross stitch.<br>  The easiest thing to do is find the centre of the pattern and the centre of the fabric.<br>  Find the largest bit of single colour near that centre line and start with that. Then fill in the other bits around it.<br>  These big sizes do take a long time and can get boring or frustrating at times. When I have a large project going, I have a few small, card sized patterns going as well, so that when I need a distraction I can do another pattern for a while.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!, unfortunately there isn't a quick way of finishing it unless you have someone helping you, but that could produce an uneven stitch.
a74b14a2df8f491b94ca062ec6bd8e23aa	Yes, pins (like what wear on your clothes). I have one for every state I've been to (nearly 30), special event that I've gone too (1994 Olympics, Air shows etc), each monument/place I visit (State Parks, Zoos, NASA etc), and I have them clubs/organizations that I've joined throughout the years. Not every place/monument/special/group has had one available. But for those that do, I always pick up a pin. Which can be expensive. The cheapest one was like 3.95 and I bought the only one available at the Statue of Liberty for $10. I've been collecting them for 16 years (my dad started me on this when I was 6) and I probably have close to 250, so it was expensive to buy them, but not worth anything to anyone but me. <br>  <br>  I also used to collect flyers/brochures from places that went, sometimes I still pick them up, but I don't make a super effort to put them all in the scrapbook like I did when I was a kid.|`|Cm7AsR26aa	i like to keep all of my letters from high school. or just any type of writing someone sent me for instance like cards. letters, notes back and forth from friends.|`|qmFERaEWaa	bottle caps, all different kinds beer, soda, etc.|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	different kinds of energy drinks|`|y1Fihj3Maa	snowflakes|`|szyrw5P0aa	soda can tabs

AA11711593	Nope. Doesn't work that way. They use a computerized algorythm which always changes so there is no way to predict when or how often they will pay out. <br>  <br>  They are, however, programmed to return a percentage of payback during certain hours or days. Guaranteed though that you will ALWAYS lose on slots because the payback is NEVER greater than the input.|`|woNv3t4paa	Thats the normal method. Sometimes happens. The win/quit/repeat won't work. It will be different every time.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	NO lol|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No. They don't know that a different person has started playing them.|`|AA10411829	That's an old wives's tale. Slot machines today are all computer run and work on algorithms that are constantly being randomized. Therefore, if you happen to win a small amount one time, it does not mean you are going to lose, or it does not mean you may win again. It's all 'random'.<br>  You have a better chance of winning if you play blackjack.

Money is made on the amount of traffic coming through your casino, just like any business. <br>  <br>  On average, gambling brings in 10% of amounts played.

szYlTBRhaa	if u mean porygon, u can do either of these 2 things.<br>  1. migrate it over from pokemon fire red or leaf green.<br>  2. when u have beaten the pokemon league and aquired the national pokedex, u can go to the pokemon mansion, which is in route 212. as soon as u enter, go north until u find the house splitting off into two halls. go along the hall on ur right and enter the first room u see. there will be a man and his butler next to him. (with a policeman guarding a statue at the back) now save it b4 u talk to the man. talk to him and he will ask u twice if u r envious of him. after that he will tell u a pokemon (this could either be porygon, cleffa,igglybuff,chansey, minun, plusle, jigglypuff, clefairy and a few more) when he says which pokemon, that will be the pokemon u can find in his trophy garden on the day u asked him. if he says a pokemon u didnt want, just reset the game and u will be back infront of him. talk to him again and he will probably say a different pokemon. keep doing this till he says porygon. then go into his trophy garden (just go directly north of the entrance to his house) then keep trying to find a porygon. the other pokemon u can encounter everyday are roselia, pichu, staravia, kricketune and pickachu so dont be suprised if u keep finding them b4 u get porygon. most of the pokemon u find there can be ranged from lvl 14-20. well hope this information helps.|`|sBYp3dISaa	You mean Porygon.<br>  I think you need to transfer it from Leaf Green/Fire Red<br>  be careful when wrtting pokemon names because it can cause confusion or making it impossible to be found by normal means in the list

I also suggest you to get your item framed or make a separate item for the cushion if you want, using the large canvas.
0nvXYAZUaa	I would say that resident evil probably has better textures, and might even look more realistic.  But Killzone 2 is over realistic.

A pawn's first move, it may move either two spaces forward or one space forward. Every other move it can only move one space forward. That's its only direction and range of motion on a normal move.<br>  <br>  There are two ways that a pawn can capture an opposing piece. The main way is a diagonal forward move--so it can move one space forward and one space either to the left or to the right if that space is occupied by an opposing piece, and then the pawn takes the opposing piece.<br>  <br>  The other way to capture is much more rare and is called "en passant," which means "in passing" in French. A pawn can capture another pawn en passant in one specific situation. If the opposing player moves their pawn two squares (on its first move out of its starting position), and your pawn COULD have captured that pawn if it had only moved one square forward, then you can capture the pawn "in passing"" by moving to where the opposing pawn would have been if it had only moved one square forward. You still only move your pawn diagonally to capture, but in this case, the piece you capture is not actually on the square you move to. You have to do this right away, or you forfeit the right to capture this way.<br>  <br>  There are lots of chess websites that can help explain this if you need.|`|f0c1edc7368ad650ec43a2b4feb3a7cdaa	Under normal circumstances, a pawn can only move one space directly forward. If a pawn has not yet moved during the game, you can choose to move it two spaces straight forward instead.<br>  A pawn CANNOT take a piece by moving straight forward. It must move diagonally forward one space in order to take an opponent's piece. Taking pieces is the only circumstance in which a pawn may move diagonally.|`|jCeylLsIaa	always forward. (1) i square; (2) 2 squares; (3) one square diagonal to take an opponents piece, and landing on the same square (not horizontal); (4) one square diagonal to take an opponents pawn that came from starting square, and passed its line of capture (en passant)|`|AwZt6XZnaa	The pawn moves differently regarding whether it moves to an empty square or whether it takes a piece of the opponent. When a pawn does not take, it moves one square straight forward. When this pawn has not moved at all, i.e., the pawn is still at the second row (from the owning players view). Optionally, the pawn may make a double step straight forward. For instance, a white pawn on d2 can be moved to d4. <br>  <br>  When capturing, the pawn goes one square diagonally forward. <br>  There is one special rule, called taking en-passant. When a pawn makes a double step from the second row to the fourth row, and there is an enemy pawn on an adjacent square on the fourth row, then this enemy pawn inthe next move may move diagonally to the square that was passed over by the double-stepping pawn, which is on the third row. In this same move, the double-stepping pawn is taken. This taking en-passant must be done directly: if the player who could take en-passant does not do this in the first move after the double step, this pawn cannot be taken anymore by an en-passant move. <br>    <br>  Pawns that reach the last row of the board promote. When a player moves a pawn to the last row of the board, he replaces the pawn by a queen, rook, knight, or bishop (of the same color). Usually, players will promote the pawn to a queen, but the other types of pieces are also allowed. (It is not required that the pawn is promoted to a piece taken. Thus, it is for instance possible that a player has at a certain moment two queens.)|`|IVspEiAFaa	When a pawn is moving from its original placig it can move two squares<br>  but after that it can only move one space. A pawn can only move forward. When a pawn atacks the piece its attacking must be on the squre diagonal from the pawn. Pawns can't move backward.Tip: A poison pawn can help you capture your opponents valuble pieces. You set it up so the pawn is able to be easily killed by say the opponents queen. Make sure some other piece of yours like your knight can kill the queen if she captures the pawn. Try to make look not obvious. When the queen takes your pawn{if she or another player with high values does} kill them with your knight. That trick is the poison pawn.|`|sq1HyR4kaa	In chess, a pawn may only move forwards, never backwards, and can only take an opposing chess piece horizontally forwards. If the pawn reaches the other end of the board, then you can bring back any other piece of yours that was removed from the game, and then revert direction.|`|rkJhnvdjaa	As everyone has said, you can move a pawn 1 square etc. etc. BUT, if you get it to the other side of the board without it getting taken, you queen it, and it can move one space anywhere (I think) <br>  <br>  Hope I helped<br>  SirChuklez (:|`|5TbHcKNvaa	Pawns can move two squares on their first go. Then only one sqaure. They always move forward and cannot go any other way but, however they can when they take the opponents piece.

There's also a "water roller coaster" which I loved.<br>      Lotsa other fun stuff in the waterpark. In the hotel, there are two spas and a shop. There is a game called MagiQuest which is a live-action adventure game. gr8_space is the tech center. When I went, not many people were in there. There are tvs, computers, usb pluggy things, and lots of video game consoles. One other thing is that there is a fitness center.

How about something where you can beat people up, like karate? You also get graded as you progress, which will come in handy when you are at the age where you are applying for jobs and want something to put on your CV/resumé under "other interests".<br>  <br>  Or buy an electric guitar and learn to play your favourite songs.

DgK0UaAkaa	PS2 definately|`|0YiHp4lVaa	Style of graphics is different to 'good' graphics. So the fact that, as someone put it, Nintendo makes 'cartoony' games is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  The Wind Waker was one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.<br>  And last gen, if I'm being honest (minus Xbox), I didn't see a game that had better graphics than Metroid Prime.<br>  <br>  So Gamecube.<br>  <br>  And regarding which had better games, they both have their gems, but the PS2 had way more of them. No question about it.|`|qxvSsMTiaa	in my opinion, the ps2 has better graphics than the gamecube. the game selection varies for both systems but one thing ive noticed is that nintendo has aimed their games towards a younger audience where ps2 has more shooting games and games that are for more teens and adults. if you like rated M games i would go with the ps2. hope this helps|`|17EFogOPaa	I think it is the PS2 because the games made by nintendo are mainly cartoony.

For example, it's implausible that the 5th use of an Evade-increasing move provides greater benefit than the 4th use.

cZp2neMDaa	First, some history on Midgar and Mako energy: <br>  <br>  Mako energy is a highly concentrated form of magic that flows around the Planet in the same way that lava flows around our Earth. There is a component in Mako energy called the life-stream. When anything living dies, its body and soul join the planet in this life-stream "lava" flow. When a new living organism is born, it takes a portion from the life-stream into itself. Understanding the life-stream and Mako energy is one of the key components of Final Fantasy 7. <br>  <br>  Mako happens to be a very profitable and dangerous source of energy. The Shinra realizes just how profitable Mako energy can be. By harnessing all this Mako energy as the main source of power in the world, the life-stream is becoming poisoned. <br>  <br>  What the Planet does when it is in danger: <br>  <br>  When the Planet is in danger, the life-stream attempts to heal the Planet by surrounding the wound. If the Planet is dying, or is in fear of dying, it summons its protectors as a last resort at survival. These protectors are extremely powerful fighters called WEAPONS. What gives the WEAPONS their energy is Mako. <br>  <br>  Structure of Midgar: <br>  <br>  The structure of Midgar is as follows: there are 8 reactors for harnessing Mako, all located on the outskirts of the circular city. The city consists of an upper plate, and a lower plate. The lower plate is the slums, and the upper plate contains the entrances to the reactors. In the middle of the city is the largest building and support structure, the Shinra Headquarters. <br>  <br>  Cloud's Arrival:<br>  <br>  At age 21, Cloud works as a mercenary for hire. As an ex-SOLDIER, (the military force of Shrina) his skills are in high demand. He decides to join AVALANCHE in their fight to save the planet from total Mako destruction. He is with them as they blow up the first Mako reactor. After the sucessful explosion, Cloud runs into Aeris, a flower girl from the slums. She is interested in what happened and Cloud shoos her off, but not without buying a flower. At the hideout, which is Tifa's bar, Seventh Heaven, Cloud demands his money from Barret. Barret is the leader of AVALANCHE. After a few choice words, Barret gives Cloud his stash - 1,500 gil, and Cloud agrees on staying with the group for another 3,000 gil. <br>  <br>  Barret, Tifa and Cloud leave:<br>  <br>  Barret, Tifa, and Cloud go on another reactor bombing. It does not go along smoothly and during a boss fight, Cloud drops from the upper plate, to the slums below and lands in Aeris' church on a bed of flowers. Aeris has special powers because she is what is called the Cetra, or the Ancients. <br>  <br>  I'll go into detail on the history of the Ancients and Aeris. <br>  <br>  The Ancients were the original civilization of the Planet. They had special powers to commute with the Planet. This power of communication was heriditary and was passed on from generation to generation. Eventually, an invader civilization, called Jenova, took over the planet and drove out most of the Cetra. At the time when Cloud meets Aeris, she is the sole Ancient left. Aeris' mother, Iflana, was an Ancient, and her father was Professor Gast. Both were killed in her early childhood. Elmyra, her guardian, took Aeris in as her daughter, and Elmyra came to understand the powers that Aeris had to communicate to the life-stream and the Planet itself. Because of this power, The Shrina want Aeris to help them achieve more of the power the Planet has. Also, there is a legend that exists...The Ancients can lead the way into The Promised Land, an area rich in Mako supply. <br>  <br>  Back to the story: <br>  <br>  Cloud decides to walk her back home, since the Shinra are on the loose and are looking for Aeris. He tells Aeris his story of joining Shinra on the way to her house, and she says that she is reminded of her ex-boyfriend, Zack. Cloud says that he doesnt recognize the name. Aeris wants to join AVALANCHE, and before Cloud can protest, he sees Tifa being led away to Wall Market, where they learn that Tifa is being held as one of Don Corneo's prize ladies. Don Corneo runs a pimp business. Aeris and Cloud find their way rather humorously into Corneo's mansion, where they rescue Tifa. <br>  <br>  In the process of rescuing Tifa, they learn that Heideggar of Shrina hired Don Corneo to locate Barret's hideout. Their plan is to destroy the plate above the slums where Seventh Heaven is located, and wiping out the whole sector of slums. Corneo turns the tables in his favor and sends them to the sewers below the mansion via a trap door. Eventually they fight their way to the pillar that supports the doomed plate and they lose the battle to keep it standing. In the midst of the fight, Aeris gets taken hostage by the Shinra. The team of Barret and Tifa go after her in the Shinra Headquarters. <br>  <br>  At the Headquarters: <br>  <br>  While in there, they also discover that Professor Hojo, who took over Professor Gast's work when he died, is attempting to make Jenova come alive again after years of hibernating. Red, Aeris, Tifa, Cloud and Barret escape the Shinra Headquarters and leave for Kalm. They leave because Shrina is chasing them, and because the Shrina put the blame of the falling plate on AVALANCHE. <br>  <br>  At Kalm:<br>  <br>  Cloud tells his "story" to the remaining members of AVALANCHE. His story consists of working with Sephiroth, his first time fighting as a SOLDIER and how close Sephiroth and him were. Their relationship changed after Sephiroth reads books by Gast and Hojo in the Shinraa Mansion. He calls Cloud a betrayer and a traitor, and burns down the town of Nibelheim. From then on, Cloud and Sephiroth have been arch-enemies. Nibelheim was Cloud's hometown. Cloud doesnt fully understand why Sephiroth went crazy and called him a traitor. After the story, the team heads out for the Mythril Mines and Junon. <br>  <br>  At Junon, Cloud disguises himself as a Shinra SOLDIER and learns new information that Shrina is following Sephiroth. Now, why would the Shrina be interested in Sephiroth? Because they believe that Sephiroth is also an Ancient that will lead them to the Promised Land. The team leaves Junon Harbor on a Shrina boat, and Sephiroth is on the boat with them. When they finally catch up to Sephiroth, he vanishes and leaves the team with a nasty Jenova suprise. <br>  <br>  The boat ends up across the ocean, in a resort town called Costa Del Sol. Hojo is on the beach here, and the only key information he gives Cloud is that Sephiroth is headed to Mt. Corel. They leave first thing in the morning for Mt. Corel and the Gold Saucer. The Gold Saucer is the Disney World of Final Fantasy 7. Here you can test your skills at the battle arena, or just play games. <br>  <br>  North Corel and the Gold Saucer:<br>  <br>  Upon entering the mining town of North Corel, Barret recieves a cold welcoming due to the fact that people blame him for the destruction of thier town because he did not want to join Shinra. The people had gotten upset and wanted to blame Barret for anything that went wrong. They quickly use the ropeway and head for the Gold Saucer, where they run into a new character, Cait Sith. He joins your party. After the encounter with Cait Sith, they discover the battle arena. The battle arena is covered with dead bodies with bullet wounds. Could it be that Barret did this because he was upset at his town? They all get thrown in the Gold Saucer prison with no possibly of escaping...<br>  <br>  Unless someone wins a Chocobo race. They all elect Cloud to be the jockey, and with a little luck, Cloud wins the race. With their new car as one of their gifts for winning, they can travel faster. And off they go for Gongaga Village. <br>  <br>  At Gongaga:<br>  <br>  The Turks (the group that does the dirty work for Shrina) are awaiting for them. How do they know AVALANCHE's whereabouts? Maybe it's a spy. After a battle, the victorious group heads for Cosmo Canyon. <br>  <br>  At the home of Red VIII:<br>  <br>  . It is here that they learn that Red's real name is Nanaki, and he is very ashamed of his father. Underneath the Canyon is a place called Caves of the Gi, where Red learns his fathers true heroic fate. They are assisted by Red's grandfather, Bugenhagen. After Red feels better about his father, they are all off to Nibelheim. <br>  <br>  According to Cloud's memories, the town should of been burnt down by now. But it still stands, as un-burnt as it ever could get. Cloud thinks its a cover-up, and some people hint that Sephiroth is inside the Shrina Mansion again. Cloud goes into the Mansion, and discovers Sephiroth once more. This is where Vincent joins also. Sephiroth mumbles something about a "reunion" and invites Cloud to Mt. Nibel.<br>  <br>  At Mt. Nibel:<br>  <br>  After inviting him, Sephiroth leaves Cloud there at the Mansion. Cloud goes to Mt. Nibel and defeats the Materia Keeper. Cloud is then free to leave Mt. Nibel and head to Rocket Town. <br>  <br>  Here, Cloud learns that Shrina used to have a program that financed space exploration. However, something terrible went wrong and the rocket never flew. AVALANCHE encounters Cid and he joins the team. They also get the Tiny Bronco, Cid's plane. They escape to Wutai, Yuffie's hometown. <br>  <br>  Some trouble with Yuffie here, but everything works out in the end with little damage done. <br>  <br>  The team than heads back to the Gold Saucer under Cait Sith's advice. On the way there, they stop at the weapon seller east of Gongaga. He tell you a little about the Temple of the Ancients. This legend intrigues Aeris. As it turns out, he just sold the Keystone of the Temple of the Ancients to Dio, the owner of Gold Saucer. <br>  <br>  Back at Gold Saucer:<br>  <br>  Dio offers it to Cloud, but only if he participates in the battle arena. Cloud does, and no matter what he does, Dio gives it to him. However, during the night, Cait Sith steals it and than hands it over to the Shinra. Dirty thief! Quick! Race to the Temple of the Ancients and see whats up. When you arrive, the man in black will mention Black Materia and then vanish. <br>  <br>  Black Materia??<br>  <br>  Black Materia is the key to Sephiroth's plan. The life-stream gathers around any of the planet's wounds to aid in healing. Sephiroth's plan is to make a wound that cannot heal, and absorb all the life-stream/Mako energy to become the ruler of all. His strategy is to summon a Meteor to kill the planet. Cloud must not let this happen and the gang follows him. <br>  <br>  Here is the confusing part: Cloud actually hands over the Black Materia to Sephiroth at Sephiroth's command. Why? No one knows why......yet. Two difficult bosses later, Cloud realizes that Aeris has left and the team leaves for Bone Village in the northern continent. With the lunar harp in hand, the group enters The Sleeping Forest and than to the City of the Ancients. Cloud approaches Aeris, who is locked in prayer, communicating to the planet that there is terrible danger ahead. Sephiroth comes crashing down and kills Aeris while she is praying to the planet. <br>  <br>  In the morning, the remaining AVALANCHE members head towards Icicle Inn and the Gaea Cliffs in search of Sephiroth to avenge what he has done. Crossing the Great Glacier is no easy challenge, but Cloud feels as if him and his group are up to it. Finally, there is light ahead - It's the crater where Sephiroth is. After defeating yet another Jenova and re-receiving the Black Materia that strange thing happens again.<br>  <br>  Cloud again hands the Black Materia to Sephiroth and than he is thrown into the life-stream. Meanwhile, a Cloud-less Tifa and Barett are being lead to their execution. The Shinra blamed AVALANCHE for the summoning of Meteor. Tifa escapes from the gas chamber and she leaves with Barret on the Highwind (Cid's airship) to search for Cloud. <br>  <br>  Several clues lead Tifa to believe that he is in Mideel. She discovers him alive, but he has contracted severe Mako poisoning and may not live. Tifa stays with Cloud for the moment while the rest of the team looks for a way to stop Meteor and they head for North Corel on a runaway train that is following the Shrina. At a brief stint at Fort Condor, Cid asks to go see Cloud and Tifa again, so off everyone goes to Mideel. After a battle with the Ultimate WEAPON there, Mideel is left in ruins, and the life-stream surges up to help repair the damages. <br>  <br>  Ready to get seriously confused?<br>  <br>  Cloud and Tifa have a discussion about Cloud's "real-self". Ok kiddies, this is where it becomes extremely complicated. And you thought it was bad before! It all sums up to this: Cloud has been lying to everyone straight to their face. He wasn't a SOLDIER. He was a Shinra 3rd class, which translates as effective as a fat police officer in front of a Dunkin Donuts on New Year's Eve. Than how did he get that uniform? He stole it from his friend Zack (does that ring a bell) after Zack tried to stop Sephiroth. The amazing part is that Zack attempted to kill Sephiroth, and failed, while Cloud had the strength to throw him over the Nibel reactor. <br>  <br>  Hmmmmmmmm........Ok let's go back to Professor Hojo for a minute. It's clear that Cloud and Sephiroth have some bond between them. That was made obvious when Cloud handed over the Black Materia after the Temple of the Ancients. Cloud isn't your everyday Shinra 3rd class. He was taken from his mother at birth, and so was Sephiroth taken from his mother Lucrecia at birth. They were going to be a part of a Mako experiment together - to become Super-humans. Sephiroth was deemed the sucess, while Cloud was the failure. <br>  <br>  The type of Mako they were infused with is very important to understanding the story. The Mako energy was the Mako that belonged to Jenova, the invador race to the planet. This Mako is poisoned. Hojo believes this Mako to be of the Ancients, and this is what he tells Sephiroth. <br>  <br>  He believes Hojo, and Sephiroth than goes to fight for the Shinra 1st class, while Cloud is than thrown into Shinra 3rd class. So, in effect, Sephiroth and Cloud are of the Jenova race. Cloud has no recall of the experiment. What he does remember is that he promised Tifa a long time ago that he was going to be a SOLDIER and protect her. He invented this story of him becoming a SOLDIER and than became so used to telling it that he believed it himself. <br>  <br>  This is why Shinra is after Sephiroth, because they think that Sephiroth is an Ancient. If you are thinking "why wasn't Nibleheim burned to the ground?", this is why. Sephiroth implanted that image into Cloud's head so that when the group arrived at Nibleheim, they would think that Cloud was a liar, and abandon him. <br>  <br>  Whew! <br>  <br>  I hope that helps you to understand. Anyways, now that we know Cloud's true past it should be much more easier to understand why Cloud wants to avenge Sephiroth. <br>  <br>  Let's go back to the story. <br>  <br>  After Mideel, Cloud follows the Shinra to the Underwater reactor in Junon. Shinra has been taking Huge Materia all this time this way they can attempt to shoot it out of a cannon so they can break up Meteor. Cloud, knowing that Meteor runs off of Mako energy, knows that the blast of Huge Materia will only help Meteor gain strength. Also, the real problem is Sephiroth. Cloud needs to destroy Sephiroth, in turn, destroy Meteor and save the Planet. <br>  <br>  Shinra is going to use the rocket in Rocket Town to launch the Huge Materia. Cloud intercepts them and goes into the rocket. Shinra launches the rocket, and the team narrowly escapes with the Huge Materia from an escape pod. The team drops off the Huge Materia at Bugenhagens lab in Cosmo Canyon, and return to Midgar after fighting Diamond WEAPON. There, they follow Cait Sith into the back alleys and then underground, and right to the Sister Ray. The Shinra plan on shooting Mako out of the Sister Ray cannon right at the crater where Sephiroth is hibernating in order to break the barrier. Mako does nothing to harm Sephiroth, but it may destroy the barrier proctecting him. <br>  <br>  Hojo is busy overloading the Sister Ray. Why? Because Hojo is Sephiroth's father and he wants his son to suceed. Hojo and the team fight, and after the team wins, it's off to the crater to face Sephiroth for the final time. <br>  <br>  In the Crator: <br>  <br>  The brave team goes down the twisting paths into the heart of the crater for the final match. And, after defeating Sephiroth, Meteor stops a matter of a few hundred feet away from the planet. Aeris is present in the life-stream to make sure the damage done is at a minimum. It is really Aeris that makes the survival of the planet a true thing. 500 years later, Red XIII has his own grandchildren, and they go to visit Midgar. Midgar is overgrown with plants and trees and living creatures. Mako energy is once again rich and pure in supply.|`|FK9sbbaraa	1.a wanna-be zack<br>  2.?<br>  3.?<br>  4.because its been like 20 years?<br>  5.um...shes awesome<br>  6.i havt played for 5 years but assuming what you said,because zack didnt know aeris till they were both dead and up there?<br>  7.O.o<br>  8.o.O hes a vampire?he just likes capes...lol.

I think about it in these terms, the PS2 has a LOT of great fighting games on it including Tekken, Mortal Combat, War of the Monsters (yes that is a fighting game), and dozens of others I can't summon a the moment. The Gamecube, not so many. When I play SCII, I like to use Voldo because he seems so random and unpredictable. I could execute moves on the GameCube and repeat them that I had never even found on the PS2. It had to do with the unusual controller design. And while you dont care about the exclusive characters I just gotta say it, why would a PS2 owner that Likes Heihachi need to buy a diffefrent PS2 fighting game to fight with him when there are 3-4 Tekken games on the same platform that do the same thing.

GH8a2mNIaa	i think that you should have tyranitar. it is harder to beat than the salamence who will die with any ice move. but I think that you should change stone edge to maybe like a thunder or something|`|i7XVQlucaa	You should use tyranitar because it is a stronger when you level it up, although Salamence is well balanced he has to many weaknesses. And don't teach anyone thunder because the accuracy on that move sucks. The moves you currently have are really good moves and I would keep them that way.|`|LlERuqtfaa	i can give u a Tyranitar if u want<br>  <br>  Reply here<br>  Brandonk1127@yahoo.com|`|058719985455d38689f6d963269b4344aa	Tyranitar.<br>  It has Crunch and Ice Fang which are pretty good moves.|`|VWxUK6shaa	I think you should pick the Tyranitar (rock/dark)because in the Diamond version you already got Dialga(dragon/steel) as a dragon type. And Salamence(dragon/flying) has much more weakness then Tyranitar. For example Ice attack are supereffective on both flying and dragon type pokemon that makes ice attacks hit X4 as much as normal and then all the other weakness... rock, dragon and electric that is 4 all together!!! I think you should pick Tyranitar!|`|yEZdicP7aa	I personally like tyranitar. however, like salamence, it will take a while if u start with a bagon or larvitar. Nice team by the way i got a lvl 90 blastoise.|`|iN9V3lmhaa	Tyranitar since ice would finish salamence in one or two turns.|`|r2MUSKaOaa	salamence its way better
4AQPx75qaa	I have all this on my Games n' Music.  Most of the stuff you can get at www.gbadev.com (click Forums, then look under DS Homebrew Announcements).  You'll want to know how to patch files with DLDI, which allows the files to access other files off of your microSD card, such as music and video files.  I have a YouTube page with videos about DLDI patching (I recommend DLDIrc if you're new to it, all you gotta do is right click on the DS program and click Patch).  Then, look at my videos to install programs you want.  I have (or have had in the past) these programs (not videos for all, but some):<br>  <br>  (requires DLDI means you need to patch it, but don't worry, it's not hard)<br>  <br>  nesDS (NES emulator, requires DLDI)<br>  SNEmulDS (SNES emulator, requires DLDI)<br>  Lameboy 0.9 (GB/GBC emulator, requires DLDI)<br>  MoonShell (audio/video/image/text player, req. DLDI)<br>  DSOrganize (multipurpose audio player/recorder, img viewer, program booter, basic web browser, IRC client, calendar, drawing app, and more, req.

Stay away from ROM sites, as ROMs are illegal (and they don't work with the GnM, so don't bother trying), but homebrew code is usually licensed open source and free, so it's entirely legal to use.

WxmNSxNGaa	Tournaments turn into all-in fests when the blinds get high, and if you're playing tight, chances are you're always calling or getting all-in with better starting hands than your looser opponents.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're playing bad players (which almost all home games are a bunch of idiots), you can often sit around and not play at all in tournaments and wait for the other players to knock each other out. I've played many low buy-in sit and goes where I played almost no hands at all until I was practically in the money. I've even won multiple double or nothing tournaments without playing a single hand.<br>  <br>  In ring games with bad players, you still must still play solid poker. You must understand when to call, raise and fold. You must be able to put your opponents on some kind of hand. <br>  <br>  Your problem is probably that you simply are not that good. You don't really know what you're doing, you've just stumbled into a technique to beat very soft tournaments. I'm not trying to insult or degrade you. I'm just letting you know that you need to really evaluate your play, and try and continue to learn and improve. And that's not something anyone can do for you on Yahoo Answers.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	playing that tight, you are a donkey...cash games you play too tight and too low a limit....in tournaments you are just getting lucky that you have good playing hands with so few blinds in the later stages.....|`|85AoQYh8aa	I used to have the same exact problem.  See with the tournies its all about staying in cause when your done your done so the tight game you play will usually pay off dividends as long as you start to play more aggressive in late stages of the tourny.  <br>  <br>  Now with cash games it really takes a lot more aggression to be a winning player.  First of playing very aggressive in cash games, but within reason makes you a difficult person to play against.  This style works in cash games because your gonna take a lot more small pots down without even showing your hand and when you get into a big pot you have a much better chance of getting called down simply because your opponent will not know what you have.<br>  <br>  So to some it up Cash games come out of the gate firing and switch gears every now and then and tournies very tight early and loosen up late, which i think you might have down<br>  <br>  and if you are playing short handed cash games this advice goes double a very tight player at a 6 max table is going to have a tough time being profitable.|`|mGF40LBMaa	It is tough to answer without knowing how you play.<br>  But generally in tournaments you should start out playing like a cash game (premium hand selections) and then loosen up and play a wider range of hands as the blinds go up and there are fewer players.<br>  <br>  Maybe your playing too loose in the cash game?
Vu3J4e0saa	I would suggest wrapping the bow in a small piece of bubblewrap or similar for protection.  I use this to protection spcial embellishments on cards in normal envelopes that I send from Spain to UK and it works|`|uwwvtwtyaa	I've debated about this too since we use boxes and obviously envelopes would be cheaper!  I would suggest putting one in the mail to yourself and see what kind of condition it arrives in!  Better yet, send it to a friend who lives further away (because it will obviously travel more than just if you send it in your home town to yourself) and then have them report the condition to you.  Best way to find out is to test it!  Hope that helps!!|`|AA12384115	People send all sorts of things in regular envelopes.

16e5fd7730a97c9f85ee890bb74f388caa	This is really kind of a tricky recipe because it's like making bread. You gotta make it a few times to get just the right texture. Also, cheaper brands of glue may not work as well because they have too much water in them.<br>  <br>  Combine approximately 2 parts glue to 1 part liquid starch. Stir it up and it will stick to whatever you're stirring it with. If the mixture sticks to your fingers, add more liquid starch. If it won't stick to itself, add more glue. Store in an airtight container in the fridge. If you want the mixture to get tougher and thicker, let it dry out a bit in the air. If you get it just right (and I rarely do,) it will pick up newsprint like the store bought stuff.<br>  <br>  Silly putty is lots of fun to cut with scissors. Also use some playdough toys with it, or ice cube trays, muffin tins, plastic strawberry baskets, etc. Caution: This often sticks to clothes, hair, furniture. Wear a smock and play with this stuff in uncarpeted areas! If you get it on fabric, use vinegar to get it out.<br>  <br>  _____________________________<br>  <br>  Recipes for Slime and Silly Putty<br>     SLIME<br>     Materials:<br>  glue (wood glue works well but white glue will work too)<br>  liquid laundry starch<br>  water<br>  measuring spoons<br>  plastic spoon<br>  1 small cup<br>  food coloring (optional)<br>  plastic bag (optional)<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  1. In the cup, put 1 tsp glue and 1 tsp water. Stir to dissolve glue. Add some food coloring if you want colorful slime.<br>  <br>  2. Add 1 tsp laundry starch to your glue mixture; stir well.<br>  <br>  3. As the new material starts to form, you may have to take it out of the cup and knead it to make the slime form.<br>  <br>  4.

Roulette in particular isn't exploitable AT ALL.<br>  <br>  You can beat blackjack by counting cards, but not in an online casino.  Also the blackjack sniper system doesn't really count cards for you, it does, but all it uses it for is modifying playing strategy which isn't enough to overcome the house edge and falls short by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Basically it forces you to you composition dependent playing strategy which is superior to basic playing strategy but will not beat the game.<br>  <br>  Send the guy and angry letter and ask for your money back under his "guarantee"

If you have a specific card and you're curious, usually it's worthwhile to search for it on Ebay and see how much they're going for on the competitive market.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	it all depends on the card. some cards are worth more than others, for example, a super rare solemn judgment is worth more than an ultra rare red eyes B. dragon. it's a super rare, but it is still worth more than an ultra rare. also, just so you know, secret rare is worth more than ultimate rare, and is also hardder to get/worth more than parralel rare, so switch those. and promo rare is not the same as secret rare, promo cards are usually virtually worthless, exept for some cards, like ccv but thats an ultra. i hope this helps.  :-)|`|QzD3rJtMaa	It all depends on the cards really.<br>  <br>  Some Rares are no more than a dollar, while other Rares, like Blizzard Dragon, are around $7-$10.<br>  <br>  A lot of Super Rares go for $5-$10, but others can go for up to $25.<br>  <br>  The same thing goes for Ultra Rares.  There are some UR that go for $10, while stuff like Allure of Darkness and Plaguespreader Zombie can go for a lot more, $20-$30 and $60, respectively.<br>  <br>  You can't put Secret Rares and Promos in the same category.  Yes there might be Promos that are Secret Rares, but they are in a way different price range.  Secret Rares can range from anywhere between $10-$200 depending on the cards.  Beliel of Darkness is around $10, while stuff like Dark Armed Dragon is about $150.  Darklord Zerato is around $30, while Charge of the Light Brigade is about $60.  So as you can see they are all different prices.<br>  <br>  I can't even begin to talk about Promos as the majority of them are priced relatively low, but there are some that are hard to get and can get pretty pricey.  Promos include anything from Video Game cards to Shonen Jump Championship cards, which can easily reach $3,000.  Some of the older ones have gone down in price.  The original Cyber-Stein, when it was first released, went for around $10,000 and now it only goes for about $500.<br>  <br>  Ultimate Rares are slightly higher priced then their Ultra Rare counter-parts.<br>  <br>  Parallel Rares aren't really worth much, but are hard to find and awesome to try and collect.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but all cards are priced differently.

After this you'll need to create your network setup to play online, you can either use the "network start-up" disk, or use a game that has online (note that not all online games have the yjis option).|`|AA11864737	you need the cord first of all you cant just get online.

Last, but least the PS3 has great graphics, very very expensive, and DID YOU KNOW THAT SOME PS3'S HAVE ALREADY CAUGHT ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10330176	P3 = expensive + best graphics<br>  X360 = best price/value +  good graphics<br>  Wii = good price + FUN|`|09137b9f99879f342e0127e6b4c90049aa	PS3 has the best graphics, if you can get it working. the Wii as the worst graphics but is the best system by far, it is freaking amazing.<br>  oh the Wii will be the best, you can't find them any where, but you can find PS3's, witch shows that every one loves them, so it will be on top.|`|718c777b5d1a38da9a05b9d6a9f5c738aa	Number one the wii isn't in any of those catagories, they are for gaming not graphics.  <br>  <br>  If you're a graphics whore the ps3 has a better graphics engine and processing power for games but as of right now there are only a handful of games.<br>  <br>  The 360 has more games and more stuff for it.  There is more perferial equiptment for it.  Right now the one on top is the 360 but next year it will be the ps3.  It all depends on what games you like.  It's all about preference.|`|AA11053376	The WI = low price+great hardware+good game ideas+not he best Graphics<br>  <br>  PS3 = Expensive+Best Graphics+same idea as PS2<br>  <br>  360 = More pricey than wii but less than the PS3+good graphics<br>  <br>  I would say that the wii will probably come on top because it is very easy and addicting, there are so many different ideas for games for the wii and not so much for the other systems because not much changed with them|`|AA11233623	DONT listen to anyone. i have 360 and ps3.  i thought they would have the same graphics bc they both support 1080i hi def.  they both do but most ps games only support 720i while most 360 games if not all support 1080i. trust. today i did it to the test and 360 was better. dont beleive me, check the bak of madden for example. 360 says 480,720,and 1080 whileps3 only says 480 and 720.|`|17ef779c9a0505dd786f44b8e9b668edaa	When it comes to price, i think Wii comes on top. But Nintendo's graphics aren't getting better with every new system. So, for best graphics, I would say PS3. But of course, it's expensive and (I'm not completely positive that I'm right) rare to find, unless you want to wait hours in a line. But (here's the twist) out of ALL the consoles, i would say xbox 360 is the best, because it's got alot of games, and isn't as expensive as PS3.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|ec2b4be54ac706744ad4a92dd8020aebaa	hardware and graphics Ps3 hands down. but the price is whats gonna kill it. i still plan on gettin one in march.<br>  <br>  i hate to say it but overall 360

They are simply race or battle. <br>  <br>  Therefore I recommend Metroid Prime Hunters!|`|93bf054650be1c783486e4b33ca2b2c0aa	hunters got it this mourin didnt stop till ds went dead lol|`|f830edc7a1dbb5fc835539290e66c428aa	well its up to you but i think the ds is online enables so you might be able to play mario cart online|`|AA11053376	i would get hunters because it is a great game with wifi and nearby lan connection and a good single player campaign

9SfCFSMbaa	A Hanafuda card-making company known as "Nintendo Koppai" was founded on September 23, 1889 in Kyoto, Japan by Fusajiro Yamauchi.  Nintendo roughly translates as “leave luck to heaven."  Though the company has gone through several name changes as they evolved into the game giant we know today, they have always returned to using the word "nintendo."

It messes up big time and it ruins the game. cheating in a game is no way to get the real power of it. i should know, im a lvl 1 god in Elderscrolls series....not much fun going around with a glove that continuously shoots fireballs on a town.
48df71d3f06d9ec010cac1d6bf33633aaa	That's simple, nintendo's waiting for their "WiiConnect24" system to go live. They stated they were going to make SSBB, wifi after all. And honestly, the longer they take to make it, the great of an achivement it will be. As for metroid, i'm not sure. There's something about nintendo, and making their games the highest quality possible. look at Zelda: TP, they took ages on that, but it is an amazing game. So they're doing the same thing with MP3; just have some paitence. Good things come to those who wait.|`|493d5e190deb0d420f35254ce23226b0aa	Im not sure. But thats the way things go usually. It seems like game companies announce a game, get their basic concepts together and then judge how much more effort to put in on it based on the response of it. Thats just what I think though. Since most games that are majorly delayed have a lot of publicity and fanbase behind them. Maybe they just like making people wait? Who knows.
48df71d3f06d9ec010cac1d6bf33633aaa	I hate to tell ya, but you have to: (1) shut off your PC, (2) get back on the download client (3) redownload it.  The same thing happend to me, i tried everything humanly possible. but, after i did that it worked perfectly.
q3DBgO59aa	That's really simple: if you're looking for nice graphics on players, stadiums and crowds, Fifa's the game for you.  If you're looking for ANYTHING else (strategy, playability and an "almost real soccer experience") get PES. I'm brazilian and soccer is the #1 sport over here, you know. 999 out of 1000 people go for PES over here. You should do the same and enjoy yourself! ;)|`|AA11958743	I saw Fifa.

ZvAkr68eaa	oh man, I just love seeing things that I never get to see in my town.  Go online and do a google for a particular city name, plus "things to do"  or the word "fun".  Theres lots of things you wouldnt expect to be fun, but when youre with friends, you can just find something simple and and take your time, joke around, and just be there.  One of my favorite road trip memories is a foot bridge going across a river near waco texas (found it on line by searching for the town name).  Whats so cool about a foot bridge?  Nothing!  Just the fact that I was with my favorite girl, and wasnt sitting at home doing nothing or at work/school doing the same darn things i always do.<br>  <br>  Oh, another good Idea is to pick an ice cream place that you never go to unless you are on a road trip.  My family always goes to McDonalds to get a McFlury at least once every road trip.  It doesnt have to be ice cream, just make some kind of road trip tradition.<br>  <br>  Also, just go to the places where you love to be.  Me, I love hiking.  So if we are traveling to a family get together, I will make it a point to look up a hiking place thats on the way (before hand) and leave a day early just to hit up the hiking trails and then McDonalds.  Again, it doesnt have to be hiking, it can be shopping, movie theatre...  Just look up "things to do in oklahoma city" ....  or any nearby town close to where you are going.<br>  <br>  Happy traveling!!!|`|3FHuS0jmaa	Bring a deck of cards, portable dvd players, lots and lots of music.|`|RqZg4tS7aa	dont plan it, just go were you feel like going and it will be more spontaneous and fun|`|oRzVLX5Raa	stop at gas stations take pictures listen to loud music eat munchies!!!

86a1e9a55e98a4b5d6ac808b5c22e809aa	In Kingdom Hearts Sora became a Heartless for a brief amount of time when he stabbed himself with Riku's keyblade to free Kairi. Namine was created during the time when Kairi's heart left her body until Sora freed her heart in Hollow Bastion. Roxas was created during the few minutes Sora was a heartless just after freeing Kairi's heart.<br>  <br>  In Kingdom Hearts:Chain of Memories Sora is trying to find the door to the light in order to free the King and Riku. As you come to the end of the familiar worlds, the scientist-like member of Organization 13 (I think it was Vexen) draws a world card from the other side of Sora's heart. A world that Sora didn't know, but the other side of his heart knew quite well. The card for Twilight Town. Roxas' town. Roxas is reffered to as the other side of Sora's heart.<br>  <br>  What we aren't seeing during all of this are the events taking place with Roxas. <br>  <br>  While still in Chain of Memories we play through the story of Riku. Watching as he fights off his darkness. In the end we see him choose the middle path, not to Twilight, but to Dawn. This all occurs shortly before Kingdom Hearts 2 begins. Diz shows Riku the now slumbering Sora. Riku decides that he will do whatever it takes to help get Sora his memories back. What that entails is containing Roxas. Once Roxas has been freed from Organization 13 he will begin to remember Sora's memories and they will be able to re-unit Sora. <br>  <br>  However, Roxas is too strong for Riku to beat without the darkness. So Riku allows Ansem to assist him once again (in some aspects). Riku gives in to his darkness in order to save Sora. That's why when we see Riku in Kingdom Hearts 2, he looks like Ansem. With his darkness he was able to defeat Roxas and help restore Sora.<br>  <br>  This is where Kingdom Hearts 2 picks up. We play through Roxas regaining the lost memories. Then we return Roxas to Sora and gain control of Sora.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~<br>  <br>  Sora, Donald and Goofy were sealed inside the chambers because during Chain of Memories Namine did as she was told, and dismantled their Chains of Memories. Meaning what they remembered, was lies, and they couldn't remember the truth. In order to rebuild the chains, they would have to be asleep. <br>  <br>  ~~~~~<br>  <br>  The relationship between Roxas and Sora is the exact same as the relationship between Namine and Kairi. Namine is Kairi's Nobody as Roxas is Sora's.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|5933b2cb4f3f390a3bc9ebe430f6799daa	well actually (besides the fact that roxas is soras nobody) there is none. Sealing sora in the bulb was the help chain his memories together, so roxas had nothing to do with that. Once you become a nobody or a member of Org. XIII you have no connection to former self, that's why sora couldn't remember roxas, or why roxas didn't know why he knew sora|`|DiW863pPaa	Thats basically it. When Sora became a Heartless, Roxas was his Nobody. When Kairi lost her Heart, Namine became her Nobody. Thats why Roxas had to join with Sora for Sora to be revived in the begining of KH 2.|`|KF6di32oaa	Theres 3 kindomheart games????|`|AA10902080	do you remember in Kingdom hearts 1 that Sora became a heartless, at the same time he became a Nobody (get the picture?). In KH 1 Kairi had lost her the moment she was separated, and in the same time, her Nobody was formed though she wasn't turned into a heartless. <br>  now about the "Does it have anything to do with Sora sealing himself in Namine's "bulb chambers" to restore his memories?" question that you asked, actually, I don't really know why. <br>  But I know that Sora-Roxas and Kairi-Namine have a strong relationship between them.
mIpm1k7Aaa	you work it out.|`|o2WEoWp5aa	I think it's that humans in general want something when they can't have it... now that you can play it, you don't want to.

O.O.. I never thought that would happen...I remember wanting to play the game so badly and when I finally have time, I don't.

I would say that if you want to play you should give yourself some motivation maybe try to find some new things you haven't done in the game or try something else like go back to basics and work from there.  I know it sounds like work but it will work if you have the right motivation sometimes you just need to find it in an unexpected way hope this helps you out=).

G2A3iyfgaa	Garchomp by far, dragon type is the best and has many advantages.|`|AA11991193	I go for Garchomp<br>  Now go catch and train a gible|`|EJMZi7Y4aa	Lopunny I hear has some great elemental moves with some good HP, however I say some of its stats just suck. Garchomp is pretty good, but once Ice move and it is wiped out instantly. I would go for Lopunny in originality and the fact it's a Normal Type, but if you're going for sheer power (Draco Meteor people?), go for Garchomp.|`|MSGyHVjmaa	lopunny is a good normal type. one of the elite 4 have one and dude, it is hard to beat. but, but, the champion cynthia has a lv.66 garchomp that almost made me cry because it was gonna beat me! which impresses you the champion having garchomp as an undefeated pokemon or a cheap elite 4 pokemon? i would go 4 garchomp only because is a dragon type. lopunny u can beat it with close combat.|`|Q942pMr5aa	LOPUNNY!!!! (FEMALE)
zEZ2dZK4aa	there's no way to skip it if you already went to iron island and didn't get the roilu egg then that means you didn't have an open spot on your team when you first went to iron island so go back to iron island with an open spot on your team and talk to the guy with the blue hat that you helped through the cave he will give you the egg . . . hatch it and there you go. <br>  <br>  IRON ISLAND is the only place to find roilu|`|OIbBPz3Maa	uhmm i dont think unless you try to get it again because i never skipped. so yea i dont really know cause i think thats the onlyt way to get it other than using action replay|`|AA11417437	Did u say "no" when Riley asked if u wanted one? Well, i can trade u one.|`|10d39HBcaa	All you have to do is go back and get Riolu... i know cause i didnt have room at first either
