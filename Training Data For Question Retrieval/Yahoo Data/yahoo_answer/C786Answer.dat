Add salt ,pepper and about 2tbsp of vinegar to the water then add chicken. The salt and pepper add flavor to chicken pre enchilada seasoning the vinegar keeps the chicken from becoming rubber and helps with the shredding process. Continue to boil chicken(10min) but at med low until you see chicken basically all white. <br>      Remove chicken, discard remaining water and simmer chicken in enchilada seasoning back at med low or low(every ones stove is different) covered. The chicken finishes cooking in the sauce and allows the chicken to be easily shredded...final preparation should be simple putting everything together and baking....A Lot of work but worth it it's a hit at my house I just don't do it too often!|`|BRRyUK1iaa	i great, quick way is to simply buy one of those rotisserie  chickens from your local store. Then simply pull the meat from the bone, discard the gristle and you are ready to use it.<br>  <br>  My local King soopers sometimes carries pulled/shredded chicken in the deli counter.<br>  <br>  You should never boil chicken... poach it I mean. It just leaches the flavor into the water.<br>  <br>  a better way is to buy bone in, or boneless chicken breast and simply roast them in the oven. I will spray them lightly with an olive oil cooking spray and then season with salt and pepper and then roast them 15 or 20 minutes (in that general area for time) then I let them cook and shred the chicken <br>  <br>  you can go a bit fancy and season the chicken ahead of time. Maybe some good cumin. Maybe sprinkle with fresh lime juice before baking. I would say sometimes a dash of smoked paprika or a good ancho chili powder. Something that compliments the enchiladas you will eventually put the chicken into.<br>    But if anything, a plain simple roasted chicken breast that you do yourself, and then shred will probably be your best bet|`|EcdelIHtaa	I love Chicken Enchiladas!!<br>  Well the way i do them is i just boil the chicken and then i'm off to do my Enchiladas...|`|s2gRgCZvaa	i always cheat. i just buy a rotisserie bird in the grocery store and peel off the skin and shred away.
O0AfxH9Eaa	You will not get pure white but what you need to do is use the palest butter you can find. The best I've used is Lescure, Waitrose sell it, it is very pale. the icing sugar's white anyway, of course.<br>  <br>  And there's no egg yolk in buttercream, it's just butter, icing sugar and vanilla for flavouring, but you can leave that out if you want to.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I know wilton makes a powder that will help to whiten frostings that have that yellowish tint.|`|oojO4WAraa	Use Crisco or some solid white shortening instead of butter.

Its pure white color yields the truest colors. <br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  2/3 cup + 3 tablespoons water, divided <br>  1/4 cup Meringue Powder <br>  12 cups sifted confectioners' sugar, (about 3 lbs.) divided <br>  1 1/4 cups solid vegetable shortening <br>  3 tablespoons light corn syrup <br>  3/4 teaspoon salt <br>  3/4 teaspoon no-color almond extract <br>  3/4 teaspoon clear vanilla extract <br>  1/2 teaspoon no-color butter flavor <br>  Makes: About 7 cups of icing. <br>  instructions<br>  Stiff Consistency:<br>  In large bowl, combine 2/3 cup water and meringue powder; whip with electric mixer at high speed until peaks form. Add 4 cups sugar, one cup at a time, beating at low speed after each addition. Add remaining 8 cups sugar and 3 tablespoons water, shortening and corn syrup in 3 additions, blending well after each. Add salt and flavorings; beat at low speed until smooth. Keep bowl covered with a damp cloth until ready to use. For best results, keep icing bowl in refrigerator when not in use. Refrigerated in an airtight container, this icing can be stored 2 weeks. Rewhip before using.<br>  <br>  For thin (spreading) consistency icing, add up to 4 more tablespoons each water and corn syrup.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Changes in Wilton's traditional recipes have been made due to Trans Fat Free Shortening replacing Hydrogenated Shortening.|`|kQcvnhdSaa	As someone said, use pale butter.

Can be used on pasta, too): <br>  <br>    Ingredients (basic):<br>    4 Tablespoons butter<br>    4 Tablespoons flour<br>    1/4 teaspoon salt<br>    2 cups milk<br>    1 egg (beaten)<br>  <br>    In a small pot, melt butter and add flour and salt, mixing well. On medium heat, SLOWLY and GRADUALLY add milk (to prevent clumps). Stir constantly until it starts to thicken (hint: if it seems like it is taking too long to thicken, turn up heat slightly). Once it starts to thicken, continue to stir constantly for a minute more, then take off heat. Add your egg immediately and stir that in as well. This is the basic sauce. Since you are having it with potaoes, let me tell you, it will taste AWESOME if you also add some shredded cheddar cheese to it (if you have some, add it when you add the egg). I usually add about a half a cup or so, but you can add more, depending on how cheesy you would like it. If you do try this recipe and decide that you would like to try it with pasta in the future, you can also add parmesan cheese to it.<br>  <br>   So there you have it!

Qy9nZgBhaa	The earliest record suggesting man's use of animals' milk as food was unearthed in a temple in the Euphrates Valley near Babylon. An archaeologist found a mosaic frieze believed to be about 5,000 years old. This means that milk was first used as food around 3000 BC.<br>  <br>  Of course there is no way to know who or which tribe started using milk first.<br>  <br>  The word "Milk" seems to come from the old Saxon "meoluc" or the Anglian "milc" both related to the old verb "melcan" meaning "to milk."<br>  <br>  Remember that humans are mammals and as members of this group our first food is milk, so is not rare that the idea of milking another mammal would be very ancient. Despite cows are our primary source of milk, the following animals are part of a huge list of animals whose milk is good as human food:<br>  <br>  -Mare, goat, ewe, buffalo, camel, zebra, reindeer......

Slice the remaining garlic. In a 7 to 8 quart heavy kettle bring water and broth just to a boil with sliced garlic and pork. Skim the surface and add oregano. Gently simmer pork, uncovered, until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. <br>  <br>  While pork is simmering, wearing protective gloves, discard stems from chiles, and in a bowl, combine chiles with boiling-hot water. Soak chiles, turning them occasionally, for 30 minutes.

Cut halves crosswise into thin strips. In a 9 to 10-inch skillet heat 1/2 inch oil until hot but not smoking and fry tortilla strips in 3 or 4 batches, stirring occasionally, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer tortilla strips with a slotted spoon as fried to brown paper or paper towels to drain. Transfer tortilla strips to a bowl. Tortilla strips may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, at room temperature. <br>  <br>  Serve posole with tortilla strips and bowls of accompaniments. <br>  <br>  Just make sure to reheat it at school...except for the cold accompaniments.|`|wqL84O8Naa	refried beans|`|bn9UcokFaa	sopapillas and honey|`|JUC8E03taa	This one is pretty easy, very authentic, and extremely tasty recipe from Spain.

You can use it in sauces, splash a little in a foil pouch you make for cooking fish, chicken, pork or whatever in the oven.

jr2yqSJqaa	Both types contain salt but green olives are usually saltier because I believe there is salt added to the jars they are bottled.<br>  <br>  Why they are considered healthy is because they are rich in iron, vitamin E and copper, and are an excellent source of fiber. They do contain some fat, too, though.<br>  <br>  I love ALL olives in every shape, size, color, chopped or whole, fresh, jarred or canned! :)<br>  <br>  If they taste too salty I simply take a few out and run them under some cold water and I'm good to go.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	I love green olives.

The color of the olives depends on how ripe they are when they are picked.  The omega fatty acids in the fat of the olives is what makes them healthy.

AAgX0SDcaa	I have been fasting every other day for the past two weeks. It is much easier for me to fast  for 36 hours  (I drink quite a bit of water.) than to eat small meals. I kind of like the empty feeling in my stomach in the evening, can sleep much better now, and have more energy the next day. Just make sure your diet is balanced well on the days you eat. If I get a little hungry I just tell myself I can eat the next day, and it passes.  I can even smell food and watch other people eat, that doesn't bother me. Just drink enough water, because being thirsty can make you feel much hungrier.  I've lost 6 pounds, so people who say you can't lose weight by fasting for a day don't know what they are talking about. The body doesn't go into starvation-mode until-after 2 to 3 days after the fasting begins. One day won't mess up your metabolism.|`|bspRfskYaa	Can I just ask why you're planning to fast? If it is to lose weight it won't help as the body will just store more fat when you do eat again.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  In that case why not set your own rules and then just ensure you stick by them.  I think it is important to have plenty of water and chewing gum will fool your mind for a little while that you're eating.  <br>  As for resisting the temptation that is going to be hard but try to stay away from places where food is served or other people are eating - try to fill your day and just be really busy s that you don't have time to think about being hungry.  <br>  Usually people fast for religious reasons and that helps them to succeed as they are focused on that, why not ensure you get a big treat on a saturday if you succeed all day.|`|DIA8RRe2aa	I agree with the other answer, if you are doing it to diet, don't bother - If you are doing it for lent or some other spiritual reason, then you should at least drink lots of water, chew ice and meditate and pray...|`|5QicX6O4aa	If you are referring to Lent & fasting---it's NO MEAT on Fridays.<br>  <br>  List is endless, like fish, pastas, salades.....etc. Not hard at all.|`|Ho3lRmDMaa	If you are trying to loose weight there are safer ways to do it.

Plus there are other ways to exercise self control. Give up your favorite food for lent, give up refined sugars, stuff like that|`|XCXHgfUyaa	why fast? religion? well i know my friend does it on tuesdays shes so occupied all the time cuz she is hungry but she is strong i give her that, she even comes to the caf with me, ill buy her some water for that, but it is extremly hard to concentrate, possibly do it on a saterday when you dont have work or school and can relax...|`|CnBMe52naa	If you are doing this to cleanse your system, you should consume lots of water and some anti-oxidant juices such as cranberry and blueberry.  Vitamins are just fine when doing this.<br>  <br>  If you are doing this to lose weight, you are doing it for the wrong reasons and it will actually be counter productive as you will cause your metabolism to slow down to compensate for the lack of calories.

The peas and vegetables should be very soft and begin to fall apart.

Stay away from casseroles.  You can easily marinade and BBQ beef, pork, lamb, fish and pork - and grill veggies too.  Or, you can bake the same things - just don't coat anything in bread crumbs!   Instead of BBQ sauce, do a dry rub with chili powder, paprika, onion or garlic powder, cumin, salt & pepper.   You can make your own BBQ sauce by reducing (simmering) no-sodium tomato sauce with those same spices, plus lots of crushed garlic.  You can also substitute Splenda for sugar if you feel you need any sweetness in anything.  When you make chili or spaghetti sauce (you can serve it over spaghetti squash); add 1 c. of finely grated carrot to give it a natural sweetness|`|AA10928232	Rotisserie or Baked Chicken<br>  Mashed Potatoes<br>  Steamed Carrots<br>  <br>  Hamburger Patties in Gravy (thicken w/ cornstarch)<br>  Steamed Rice<br>  Green Beans<br>  <br>  Tuna Salad w/ boiled eggs, pickle relish, mayo, mustard, Stuff in a Tomato, serve on salad greens, Boiled Eggs<br>  <br>  Grilled Chicken strips atop a salad of green lettuces, corn relish, black beans, corn tortilla strips, and pineapple.

Horrid disease to have. You can make risotto using olive oil rather than butter, and no parmesan: mushroom, mixed shellfish, asparagus and smoked trout are my favourites. Your 2-year-old will probably like it too.|`|7GrncwiYaa	You can do a google for gluten free recipes.  When my husband ,a year ago had to limit wheat and dairy some of those sources provided were wonderful!  In the market ,natural foods section, you can find all sorts of gluten free, wheat free flours.  One of our favorite chicken dishes uses clarified butter and ground almonds.  To clarify butter, heat it until it froths and the milk solids brown. Pour through damp cheese cloth, the browned milk solids will be left behind. Or let the butter melt slowly until the water, milk solids and butter fats separate. Chill and you can then lift off a disk of butter fat leaving behind milk solids and water. For 4 chicken breasts, pound flat, dip in melted clarified butter, roll in 1 to 11/2 cups ground almonds and bake at 375 for about 20 min or till cooked through. Brown rice made with a bit of broth and steamed veggies go well with this.  For bread crumbs I crumble sprouted grain bread (I am lazy and use a food processor). For thickening gravies,I whisk in potato flour. <br>   A change in diet to lose weight seems so much easier then leaving out flour, sugar and dairy, at first it is so over whelming as so many foods contain these ingredients. It does get a little easier as you get familiar with the options that are out there now.  We have a limited supply of wheat/gluten free options but as the demands rise the markets are getting better at stocking.  Bob's Red Mill has a wide selection of products that are most helpful and flavorful. They have a web site with very good recipes as well.  <br>  Most markets natural foods section also have a supply of different "milks" such as almond milk, hazelnut milk, soy milk and rice milk.  My son loves the nut milks. These can replace regular milk in most cases.  In my husbands case 'soured' milk products are ok, like yogurt and sour cream as the body handles them differently. Maybe the doctor can tell you if that would be the same for your guy.  <br>  Best of luck and have fun trying new foods!!|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Beef Pot Roast --<br>  <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  2 teaspoons olive oil <br>  4 pounds boneless chuck roast <br>  1 onion, chopped <br>  2 cloves garlic, minced <br>  2 bay leaves <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). <br>  Heat a heavy Dutch oven on top of the stove over medium high heat.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	As a former chef one problem is there is more water in it, and less fat, so to compensate, use a bit more flour and a tablespoon or 2 of oil, it was meant to be a light spread type item, it is like whipped butter and lite margarine, they are adjusted to be lighter in volume and calories so they had to remove something. So if you make cookies cream the butter and a bit of oil or shortening with the sugar, and add 1/4 cup more flour to compensate for the moisture, if you use eggs only use the yolks and keep the whites for other things, even freeze them to use in meatloaf, meat balls and stuffing's as a binder|`|zawmsUO1aa	Light butter is intended to be used primarily for spreading and topping.

nBaRuZ5xaa	Although Mint Tea is a favorite beverage of Moroccans, some also like to drink their tea plain or with other herbs. Sheba, also known as absinthium or wormwood, is known for its bitter quality and medicinal properties, but when steeped with green tea it is very aromatic. Sugar, of course, will counter the bitterness.

Our favorite recipe (from Quaker Oats and Toll House Chocolate Chips) is below:<br>  <br>  FAVORITE BROWNIES<br>  Makes 2 dozen<br>  <br>  1 teaspoon vanilla<br>  2/3 cup softened butter or margarine<br>  1 cup granulated sugar<br>  1 cup rolled oats<br>  1 tsp. baking powder<br>  1/2 cup chopped nuts<br>  2 eggs<br>  2 c. (12 oz.) semisweet chocolate chips, divided<br>  1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour <br>  <br>  Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Beat sugar, butter or margarine, eggs and vanilla until smooth.  Melt 1 cup chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave on medium power for 30 seconds at a time, stirring until smooth. (In the microwave, chips will appear to hold their shape when they are actually melted.)  Mix chocolate into the butter/sugar mixture.  Add flour, oats, baking powder, remaining chocolate chips (and nuts) and mix well.  Spread batter into prepared pan.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until brownies pull away from the sides of pan. Cool completely, then cut into bars. <br>  <br>  VARIATION<br>  <br>  Use 1/4 Cup chocolate chips and 3/4 Cup mint chocolate M&Ms for one cup of chocolate chips, crush the mint M&Ms before adding.<br>  <br>  The brownies disappear so fast that I often have to make them twice during one week for us to get a full brownie "fix".  I hope you get a chance to try them.  (Don't worry when they fall during the cooling process.  They will end up being fudgy.)|`|hD1MZaanaa	1 one big fart #2 with little maggets on the side #3chopped up poop<br>  #4 try doing some chin ups #5 sumthing sweet to smile|`|kyUiaDgyaa	Just look up the recipe in a cook book or buy you a box of brownie mix and follow the directions

This can result in hair loss, fatigue, tooth decay/tooth loss, decreased immune response, heart palpitations, weight loss dizziness, scurvy, anemia, vision impairment, decreased liver and kidney function, loss of muscle and muscle function, fainting. In females, menstrual cycles will also stop. Children suffering from malnutrition will also stop growing.<br>  <br>  Short term-<br>  Hunger, fatigue, weight loss, loss of concentration, possible hair loss, dizziness, bad skin.<br>  <br>  Nature Valley granola bars are meant to be a snack, not a meal. As such, they have a very low nutrient content per calorie. In fact, an average bowl of any dry cereal, should have substantially more vitamins and minerals than a Nature Valley granola bar.<br>  <br>  Links- <br>  1- Nutritional data for the "Oats and Honey" Nature Valley Granola bar<br>  2- Nutritional data for Post "Honey Bunches of Oats" cereal, for comparison. (Click on "nutritional information, then you can scroll down using the red tab, for the entire list of vitamin/mineral content)<br>  <br>  You'll see that by comparison, you'll get more volume of food to eat, and far more nutrition, per calorie, as well as fewer calories eating a bowl of "Honey Bunches of Oats" than you would from two Nature Valley bars. One 3/4 cup serving of Honey Bunches of Oats is just 120 calories, even if you add milk, you're only at 160 calories. Still... For proper nutrition, you still should not subsist on cereal alone. You need to eat a variety of foods to ensure that you get all the flavanoids and trace minerals that cannot be obtained from a single source of food alone.|`|98a1aa89f409b8433bf738429e4cb1fdaa	Your body would go into starvation mode.  You need at least 1000 calories a day, unless you are really tiny, inactive, and not growing any more.  Growing teens, athletes, construction workers can burn more than 2000 calories a day.  <br>  <br>  When you are starving, your body actually makes less heat and more fat, to try and keep you alive until you get more food.  <br>  <br>  Plus, granola bars have a lot of sugar, and a poor source of vitamins and minerals, so you'd get weird deficiency diseases, as well. <br>  <br>  And if you drank enough water, all that sugar and fiber would give you painful gas and screaming diarrhea.  <br>  <br>  And if you didn't drink enough water, all that sugar and fiber would give you painful gas and cramps.  <br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, move your muscles.  even if you are stuck in school all day, you can pick one muscle at a time, tense it up.  Count to 5, relax, and move on to another.  It's something to do while you wait for papers to be passed out or collected, the bell to ring, etc|`|sUeZ5duGaa	You would probably have malnutrition.

Slice and cook the chicken in a 'dry' or lightly oiled fry pan (stir frequently).  Grate the cheese and have the tomatoes and onion diced small and line everything up.  Place a taco and cover half with cheese to about 1/3 inch.  Add some chicken, green sauce, and fold the taco in half.  Do this until you have enough to serve everyone two-three quesadillas.  Using a hot dry fry pan, place each 'taco shell' in and fry it quickly on both sides, remove and put into oven until all are cooked (be careful, because they will 'ooze cheese').  Place onto a plate using two and cut each into thirds using the 'pie slice (sort of triangular).  Place some tomato, onion in the 'center' and dust with chili powder.  You may also add sour cream (use 'fat free' for the best flavor) and serve ... total time ... 1/2 hour at most.

C3LiKhm8aa	Some things to think about.<br>  <br>  Did you follow the recipe properly?  Most first time bakers add too much flour, thinking that the dough shouldn't be sticky at all, when in actuality, flour and water make paste, so naturally the dough will be a bit sticky.<br>  <br>  Did you use weight or volume to measure the flour?  If you used volume, how did you fill the cup each time?  The proper way is to fluff the flour and then fill the cup carefully.  Most people have too much flour in a cup of flour.<br>  <br>  Did you knead the dough long enough?  You should knead for about 8 minutes for a typical dough, then perform the windowpane test.  Pull up a piece of dough between your ifngers and try to make it into the shape of a window pane.  If you can stretch it without tearing so that you can almost read through it, then the doughhas been kneaded enough.  If it tears, then knead it some more.<br>  <br>  Did you let the dough ferment enough and then fold it and let it ferment some more?  For a typical dough, you should it rise for an hour, then gently knead it for 15 seconds, and then let it ferment for another 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  Did you let the dough rise after it was shaped?  You should poke the dough with your finger right after you shape it.  the dough will spring back quickly.  After rising for the proper amount of time, if you poke it, it will slowly recover.<br>  <br>  DId you keep the surface of the dough from drying out as it rose?  One way is to cover the dough with a towel and spritz the towel every so often.  The purpose is to keep the dough from drying out so it can expand properly in the oven.<br>  <br>  Did you bake at the proper temperature?  Check the oven temperature.<br>  <br>  If it was a bread made from mostly flour, water, salt and yeast, did you use steam in the oven?  If it was this kind of dough, the oven temp should have been well over 400F, probably up to 425 or even 440F.<br>  <br>  Those are some questions; the link below is to a site that can give you a lot more information.|`|fBSgY0C9aa	did it rise much?? maybe you should put more yeast in and let it rise longer....just get another recipe becuase maybe your recipe had an error. also maybe the dough was too dense(too much flour).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Bread-without-a-bread-machine/" rel="nofollow">http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-M...</a>|`|KZ0ERprraa	add yeast|`|FJpPCVTCaa	depends on the grain you used, whether it's white flour or whole. if it's too dry, didn't get proofed long enough, too cold in the room, type of yeast (quick rising usually works best in bread). adding coconut milk gives it a little sweeter flavor and also helps leaven the bread for a little more for a fluffier texture.

d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	DIET and NUTRITION<br>   <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  While the science of food combining might seem complicated, putting it into practice is easily accomplished when you adhere to the following guidelines: <br>  <br>  Do not combine carbs with highly acidic foods. This could be bread with citrus, like toast and orange juice for breakfast. <br>  <br>  Do not combine protein with fat. This could be eggs and cheese with butter. Simply accomplished by not cooking an omelet in butter. <br>  <br>  Do not combine protein with acidic fruit. This means not putting tomatoes on a hamburger or oranges as a side with your eggs. <br>  <br>  Do not combine sugar and starch. This removes jam on a muffin or buttered toast. <br>  <br>  Do not combine protein with carbs. This will bring an end to those "meat and potato" dinners Americans are so fond of. <br>  <br>  Limit yourself to one starch serving at any meal. <br>  <br>  Limit yourself to one protein serving at any meal. This means skipping ham, sausage or cheese omelets. <br>  <br>  Melon should not be combined with anything. <br>  <br>  Milk should not be combined with anything. <br>  <br>  Don't feel as though food combining limits your options. At first it will feel like a balancing act, but you will find the rhythm and make it work for you. Breakfast will fit with on-the-go types as you'll eat just a single piece of fruit. Heavy veggies at lunch - a salad sans tomatoes, cooked green beans, peas or asparagus with one serving of rice, bread or potato. You'll enjoy another salad for dinner with three vegetables - two should be no starch.|`|9gPlIs3Xaa	I read about it in the You Are What You Eat book - I know that isn't really the answer but I reckon buy the book it is a good read too about other health aspects and weight aspects of eating.

I can't remember if it was some sort of dietary deficiency that made them want to do it; whether is was some sort of craving of pregnant women.<br>  <br>  Now are you sure the black woman was American?  She may have been black, but her ethnicity could have been Haitian, Dominican, Jamaican, African, etc. Now I cannot say if they do or did that sort of things in their particular country or not.  But if they did, I am sure it was related some sort of dietary deficiency as well.  Or one of those "old wives tales" that dictated a lot of things people use to do "back in the day"<br>  <br>  My girlfriends daughter is puerto rican and is 21 years old, and during her pregnancy she used to sneak and eat soap.  Now do I think all puerto ricans eat soap?  Noooooooooooo.  They only found out during her prenatal blood tests, because something or another was very high.  They treated her with something (maybe vitamins) and warned her to stop eating the soap ...lol.  Thus, the dietary deficiency I mentioned previously.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|AA10027242	Maybe she had pica.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Eating cornstarch and laundry starch are suitable when you can't find any good clay to eat.

b916f6962d68b4ccca7c451250580511aa	If you succeed in your goal, you should consider giving it up and becoming a vegetarian. I have been vegetarian going on 12 years and my last visit to my doctor was excellent. I take a multi-vitamin and B12 regularly too. I have not noticed any weight loss, in fact I look the same as I did 12 years ago but everyone is different. Vegetarianism is a very healthy lifestyle and has many positive benefits for you, animals and the environment. Feel free to visit my sites for more information.|`|AA11657757	Try recipes from www.vegweb.com <br>  You will definitely reduce your cholesterol intake, as the bad cholesterol only comes from animal products. Weight loss isn't guaranteed unless you are reducing the amount of calories you eat. If you are making meals that are fried, with lots of cheese, then you won't be losing any weight. You can be an unhealthy or a healthy vegetarian. If you are eating right, you should feel better, more energetic, and proud of not giving in.<br>  Good luck!|`|5AbCtkWFaa	As long as you don't replace the meat with dairy and eggs, you should notice some lowering of your cholesterol, especially if you throw in exercise.  And if you modulate your caloric intake, you might lose weight.  If you eat a variety of foods, you should be healthier.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you've decided to do this--thank you.|`|ARccSWfkaa	You'll probably lose at least a couple of pounds, and you may feel more energetic and healthier in general.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Maybe.. (:|`|CeXKPtCRaa	High fiber diets result in a reduction in cholesterol, but weight loss will still depend on a number of things, including fat intake, caloric intake and exercise.  Just make sure you get complete proteins!<br>  <br>  Just remember that this is still a temporary diet.  If you want to maintain fat loss (which is more important than weight loss), you need to keep a steady diet after lent, keeping the right amount of calories (lower isn't always better), and same with fats, carbs, etc.  Otherwise, once you stop, you'll gain everything you just lost!|`|UejZWThIaa	I'm sure you will it happened to me since I became a true Vegetarian in the middle of October 2008 of last year I have noticed big changes since I gave up eating all meat, I have lost weight/have more energy/Not as tired as I used to be/I have not gotten sick with colds/flu/ear infections you name it since I gave up meat and I feel great way better then I did when I ate meat I didn't grow up as a Vegetarian it was a choice I made a long time ago, and I would never go back to eating meat because it makes me have a bad stomach ache if I try to eat real meat or things with Gelatin in them so I have to eat Stony Field Organic Yogurt with no Gelatin in it and I chose not to drink cows milk because of the way they are treated to get the milk so I drink soy milk instead which I love because my grandma used to drink it and I grew to like it, I can eat Cheese and Eggs though those don't bother me as much as the rest so you might notice some changes it just depends on your body I guess good for you going Vegetarian you will feel a lot better in your life and be way more happy I know I am because I know I don't have to have killed animals to live I hope you find happiness in your choice I know I did.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	You may have a slight swelling in your purse at the end of the week!

Big bags of peanuts are always good, too and you can do popcorn for folks who aren't fond of Crackerjacks.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the decorations -- party stores, craft stores, dime stores.  Get some red, white and blue bunting or plastic banners and string them up.  Arrange a couple of bats in a corner, with a glove draped over the handle of one.  Maybe have a few baseballs scattered around the place and a some Reds logos _everywhere_.  <br>  <br>  Here's hoping my team plays the Reds for the pennant!

And as far as I know, it's never been the "norm". <br>  <br>  4) We also have prostitutes. Russia has mail-order brides. And when have Chinese women killed rich men? I have personally never heard any reports of this, at least not widespread ones. <br>  <br>  5) Again, it's a less-developed country. This exists all over the place.<br>  <br>  And again, "enlightened racists" don't exist. Racists are always ignorant.
rtuunGMSaa	If you're talking about sweetened condensed milk, the flavor and consistency is basically the same as the real thing. It's not chalky like others have said. Maybe the EVAPORATED milk is, but not the CONDENSED.<br>  <br>  I've been making magic bars for the past 15 years.<br>  <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/magic-cookie-bars-from-eagle-brand/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/recipe/magic-cooki...</a><br>  <br>  2 years ago I changed to the fat free sweetened condensed milk. There was no change in the flavor or texture of the cookies. And no one in my family (who have been eating them for 15 years) noticed the change. I use whatever is on sale; Eagle, Value, Kroger, Giant Eagle... All with the same results<br>  <br>  The only difference I noticed is the nutrition label. <br>  Happy baking!|`|saBZQJMUaa	It pretty much tastes like water with chalk in it!|`|dPlkKe7Maa	yes it gross!!! lol!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I don't like ANY low-fat milk, so - no.

uJPzCKFTaa	I used to work in a deli, and when we were making party trays and sandwiches for parties, we always figured 1/4 pound of meat per person, so for 16 people you would want to get get a 4 or 5 pound roast or 4 pounds of deli roast beef. Of course, you might want to get a little extra, because some people like to have seconds! <br>  <br>  Also, for cheese, you could do one or two slices per person. Good luck!|`|5veU5nSwaa	I would get several pounds probably 3-4 at least but not everyone likes sharp provolone so you may want to get several types of cheese, also not everyone likes roast beef, so you may be better off with a platter of some sort where they can choose there own. You wouldn't want a guest to go hungary because you provided no options.
KJmuHxcCaa	scramble them|`|rtuunGMSaa	If you're frying them (scrambled or whole), use a low heat setting. About a 3 or 4. Preheat the pn before adding the eggs.<br>  Use a little oil or butter to help the eggs release from the pan. <br>  Be patient. Cooking eggs too fast will make them stick and leave that yellow crust all over the pan. Not fun to eat or clean.  <br>  <br>  If you want sunny side up eggs. Keep the heat on low, but add 1 tablespoon of water to the pan after you add the egg. THen put a lid on the pan for a minute or so. THe steam will cook the top of the egg without hardening the yolk. Perfect for dipping! (Don't peek too early or you'll lose the steam.)|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Poached with hollandaise sauce. I poach mine in little curved coffee cups to give them shape.

2RzEaod9aa	That's actually a really good question, but you must remember that people do this for, well, just about everything. We get into huge arguments about religion, when there's really nothing WRONG with believing in a god/gods/goddesses or not. No one gets hurt just for believing in a higher power (it's only when people use that to cause pain that it gets bad, but belief in and of itself isn't bad or wrong), but people will still insult each other, look down on each other, and even get into fights over who's right. Same is true with politics.<br>  <br>  In the case of animal rights, some people believe it is their right to eat animals. I used to be one of those people. I suppose it's akin to thinking it's right to own slaves. Just because you *think* another being is beneath you doesn't mean that they are, and it certainly doesn't give you the right to abuse that being. There's a reason that great thinkers like da Vinci, Edison, Einstein, Gandhi, and I believe Newton were all vegetarian and usually said something about it. We like to separate ourselves from animals, but remember that we did (and some still do) the same thing with other races or opposite genders. <br>  <br>  I guess when you feel insignificant and insecure, it only makes sense that you wouldn't understand how to feel significant and secure without treating others the same awful way that you feel.|`|b9uOax0aaa	Some people would give animals the same rights as humans.  that is wrong.  Animals are just that, animals that fill their niche in the food chain.|`|AA11363680	They are contradictory views. If you tell me that animals have a right to live and should not be eaten, but I think that livestock exists to be eaten, one of us is likely to take offence.<br>  <br>  I personally fully agree that animals should not be abused and should not suffer needlessly. Unfortunately, most of the really vocal supporters of animal rights take things beyond that. Then in response to their verbal attacks, the more ignorant amongst the meat eaters also respond with immature babble. So both sides keep stoking the fires and irritating everyone else caught in the middle.|`|WweVOrPZaa	I think everything causes controversy in us. Because we are humans, and we are primates, who are aggressive in nature. Chimps like to shout over everything, and so do people lol. So in general, people are very much animals. We just tend to think that we're the only animals who matter in this world. Which is very much like a primate to think that way.|`|ssdl5qL5aa	Hamburgers are no where near delicious by the way. If you eat that, you are eating, dead, rotting, decaying flesh from a dead being. How is that sexy? Disgusting. Spoon into some beans, not beings. <br>  <br>  I'll never understand the lack of compassion towards innocent, beautiful, wonderful, creatures that cannot even fight back =(|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	I think it boils down to whether you think animals should have rights like people or not.|`|EDpvAf6Zaa	Like on most topics (like politics, religion, abortion, etc), people are very opinionated. They think that they are 100% right, whether they believe that animal cruelty should be stopped (like me), or whether they think that it's human nature, most people tend to be very close-minded about it.<br>  I live in a very small farming community, and as a vegetarian deal with verbal abuse from the hicks quite frequently. I don't get it, either. I'm not a super in your face vegetarian. I don't support PETA. I don't look at somebody eating their meat and scream "murder!!"  Why would anyone shove a hamburger in my face? It's like reciting bible verses to an atheist. <br>  People are dumb sometimes.|`|To3bVdjPaa	"They claim to care for animals, yet their actions suggest they care only about removing animals from the "domination" of humans - even if it means killing the animal."<br>  <br>  That was the justification for killing all those animals they took in? To me, that just goes to show more that this is not a group to be supporting (if the terrorism connections weren't enough), if they see a life lived comfortably as a companion in a home where they are loved, as worse than death because there is still the human being taking care of the animal. And I support animal liberation *in theory*, but the better thing to do would be to stop breeding them so much, and as long as people aren't doing that, I don't see how any rational person and such or organization can see it as better to kill than to even try to give a home.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Probably because people don't like being made to feel guilty about eating meat? It's part of our culture and, well, hamburgers are delicious. I don't think it's a matter of being offended that people support animal rights... they're more or less defensive about being ambivalent about it.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	The problem is animals are delicious and people want to take that away.  I am going to go fry some bacon while I think about animal rights.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	In all honesty, I can tell you why I get mad when people start hollering for "animal rights". PETA is why. They are the biggest bunch of hypocrites and liars on the face of the animal rights movement. They're also the most well-known and visible of the animal rights groups. Asking why the controversy is like claiming to wonder why no one supports Hamas even though the Palestinians elected many Hamas leaders. Because they're terrorists, that's why. And so are the people at PETA.<br>  <br>  Did  you know that in 2007 PETA found adoptive homes for  less than 1% of the animals they took in? They euthanized some animals surrendered by their owners before they even pulled out of these people's  driveways. By way of contrast, the Virginia human  societies found  homes for an average of nearly 65% of the animals they took in. <br>  <br>  I believe very strongly in the humane treatment of animals, even for non vegs. No one wants to think their food has been abused or terrorized before hitting the market. At the same time, I refuse to give PETA anything more than a nasty email, a dirty look and some well-placed harsh words when I bump into them. I treat them the same way I would  treat any other extremist or terrorist, period. They claim to care for animals, yet their actions suggest they care only about removing animals from the "domination" of humans - even if it means killing the animal.  <br>  <br>  I especially despise PETA. I really,  truly do. I used to support them with my money thinking it was going  to do  some good to stop unnecessary animal testing and the like. When I found out what murderous douchebags they were, all in the name of keeping animals from being "slaves" to humans (my pets are very well cared for and spoiled rotten, thanks), I became  so  enraged I stopped payment on the check I had just mailed them, shot off a nasty letter and immediately stopped supporting them. <br>  <br>  Are all animal rights activists like PETA? No, I know they're not. Unfortunately for them, I now no longer trust any of them. I do not want my money going  to enable the slaughter of a beloved pet, given in trust to a group who implies they will  attempt to place it - and has a worse record than the local pound. <br>  <br>  From an article I read: PETA assails other parties for killing animals for food or research. Then it kills animals -- but for really important reasons, such as running out of room. A 2003 New Yorker profile included PETA top dog Ingrid Newkirk's story of how she became involved in animal rights after a shelter put down stray kittens she brought there. So she went to work for an animal shelter in the 1970s, where, she explained, "I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through (other workers abusing the animals.) I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day." <br>  <br>  Another PETA hag, Andrea Florence Benoit Harris, was facing felony charges for stealing a hunting dog, which she evidently planned to "euthanize."<br>  <br>  That is complete BS, IMO and anyone who supports such practices and claims to be fighting for animal rights should be deeply ashamed of themselves.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Absolutely; triglycerides come from meat, particularly red meat. Going veg would lower them considerably.|`|AA11657757	If you eat a healthy, low-calorie vegetarian diet, it will help you lose weight. Avoid cheese, too.<br>  <br>  What's the best way to lower triglycerides?<br>  Healthy lifestyle choices are key. <br>  <br>  Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing the excess pounds can help lower your triglycerides. Motivate yourself by focusing on the benefits of losing weight, such as more energy and improved health. <br>  Cut back on calories. Remember that excess calories are converted to triglycerides and stored as fat. Reducing your calories will reduce triglycerides. <br>  Avoid sugary and refined foods. Simple carbohydrates, such as sugar and foods made with white flour, can cause a sudden increase in insulin production. This can increase triglycerides. <br>  Limit the cholesterol in your diet. Aim for no more than 300 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol a day — or less than 200 mg if you have heart disease. Avoid the most concentrated sources of cholesterol, including meats high in saturated fat, egg yolks and whole milk products. <br>  Choose healthier fats. Trade saturated fat for healthier monounsaturated fat, found in olive, peanut and canola oils. Substitute fish high in omega-3 fatty acids — such as mackerel and salmon — for red meat. <br>  Eliminate trans fat. Trans fat can be found in fried foods and many commercial baked products, such as cookies, crackers and snack cakes. But don't rely on packages that are labeled "trans fat-free." In the United States, if a food contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, it can be labeled trans fat-free. Even though those amounts seem small, they can add up quickly if you eat a lot of foods containing small amounts of trans fat. Instead, read the ingredients list. You can tell that a food has trans fat in it if it contains partially hydrogenated oil. <br>  Avoid alcoholic beverages. Alcohol is high in calories and sugar and has a particularly potent effect on triglycerides. Even small amounts of alcohol can raise triglyceride levels. <br>  Exercise regularly. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most or all days of the week. Regular exercise can boost "good" cholesterol while lowering "bad" cholesterol and triglycerides. Take a brisk daily walk, swim laps or join an exercise group. If you don't have time to exercise for 30 minutes, try squeezing it in 10 minutes at a time. Take a short walk, climb the stairs at work, or try some sit-ups or push-ups as you watch television.
AA12169482	I can give you an easy way to make cabbage salad that taste good, well to me it does.<br>  You chop up a 3/4 or half of a raw cabbage, then chop up tomatoes, cucumber, cilantro, some fresh avocados, then add one teaspoon of olive oil, lemon or lime juice, onion powder, garlic powder and mix well, then eat with a lean protien...it taste really good and fills you up, and more importantly it's easy and good for you|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Depends what sort of "diet" you mean, low fat, low carb, gluten free?

I doubled the recipe for a Persian New Years Eve Party and after I began making it realized that I had forgotten to buy double the Pomegranite Juice - so for the additional 4 cups juice that I needed I added Chicken Buillion - so I ended up with 4 cups of each for the double recipe. What a hit this was! (and not purple this time without the extra juice! I had made this dish before using a different recipe that also called for cubed Summer (is that the Orange?) Squash. The Orange Cubes give it a nice touch of color and flavor! People raved! Yum!|`|FhKfyxWlaa	No, I have never tried it.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	Pomegranate Stew with Chicken (Khoresh Fesenjan)<br>      *   2 tablespoons olive oil<br>      * 1 1/2 pounds chicken legs, cut up<br>      * 1 white onion, thinly sliced<br>      * 1/2 pound walnuts, toasted and finely ground in a food processor<br>      * 1 teaspoon salt<br>      * 4 cups pomegranate juice<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon cardamom (optional)<br>      * 2 tablespoons sugar (optional)<br>  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken and onions in skillet, and cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix in pureed walnuts, salt, pomegranate juice, and cardamom. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (If the sauce becomes too thick, stir in 1/4 cup warm water.) Mix in sugar, adjust seasoning, and simmer 30 minutes more.<br>  <br>  Fesenjan<br>  (Persian chicken in pomegranate-walnut sauce)<br>  <br>  Fesenjan, also known as khoresht-e fesenjan or fesenjoon, is special occasion food in Iran. It is traditionally made with duck or pheasant in the north of the country along the Caspian Sea. A thick, rich, sweet-sour dish, fesenjan improves in flavor if served the next day.<br>  4-6 servings<br>  <br>      * Butter or oil -- 1/4 cup<br>      * Chicken, cut into serving pieces -- 2 1/2 to 3 pounds<br>      * Onions, thinly sliced -- 2<br>      * Walnuts, finely ground in a food processor -- 2 cups<br>      * Stock or water -- 1 1/2 to 2 cups<br>      * Pomegranate syrup or molasses -- 2/3 cup<br>      * Sugar -- 1-3 tablespoons<br>      * Salt and pepper -- to taste<br>     1. Heat the butter or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium flame. Add the chicken pieces a few at a time and brown on all sides. Remove to a plate and set aside.<br>     2. Add the onions to the pot and sauté until translucent.<br>     3. Stir in the ground walnuts and stock or water and return the browned chicken pieces to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes.<br>     4. Stir in the pomegranate juice, sugar, salt and pepper. Simmer for another 15-20 minutes until the chicken is tender, the sauce is somewhat thickened and the walnuts begin to give off their oil. Adjust seasoning and serve with plain white rice.<br>  <br>  Variations<br>  <br>      * Use duck or pheasant instead of chicken. If using duck, trim of all excess fat before browning and spoon off any excess fat as the dish cooks. Cubed lamb or meatballs are sometimes used instead of poultry.<br>      * Pomegranate syrup, sometimes called pomegranate molasses, is available in most Middle Eastern and health food stores. If it is unavailable, you can use an equal amount of frozen, concentrated cranberry juice. The flavor is roughly the same. If using fresh pomegranate juice, use 1 1/2 to 2 cups and cut back on the stock or water.<br>      * Add 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom or 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon when sautéing the onions for a richer flavor.<br>      * Add a little more sugar if the sauce is too tart, a little bit of lime or lemon juice if it is too sweet.<br>      * The chicken can be marinated in a few squeezes of lime juice for a few hours if you like.<br>      * A peeled and cubed eggplant is sometimes added. Sauté the eggplant along with the onions. You may need to add a little more liquid to the simmering stew.<br>  <br>  Kefta (meatballs)<br>  (Middle Eastern spiced meatballs)<br>  <br>  Spiced meatballs are common in one form or another from Morocco in the west through the Middle East (kefta or kufta), to Greece (keftedes), Turkey (k?fte), Armenia (kyufta), Iran (kufteh, or koofteh) and all the way to India (kofta) in the east. All names for these little balls of wonder derive from the Persian verb kuftan, which means "to grind."<br>  4-6 servings, or about 20 meatballs<br>  <br>      * Ground lamb or beef, or a mixture of the two -- 2 pounds<br>      * Onion, minced -- 1<br>      * Fresh parsley or mint, finely chopped -- 1/2 bunch<br>      * Ground cumin -- 1 tablespoon<br>      * Cinnamon -- 2 teaspoons<br>      * Allspice (optional) -- 1 teaspoon<br>      * Salt and pepper -- to season<br>      * Oil -- 1/4 cup<br>     1. Place the ground beef or lamb, onion, herbs, spices, salt and pepper in a large bowl and knead together well. Wrap in plastic and chill for 1-2 hours to allow the flavors to mingle and make the meat easier to handle.<br>     2. Form the meat mixture into balls, patties or ovals the size of a small egg.<br>     3. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium flame and, working in batches, sauté the meatballs until browned on all sides and cooked through. Browned meatballs can also be finished in a 350oF oven.<br>     4. Serve as is or in pita bread as a sandwich with tzatziki sauce.<br>  <br>  Variations<br>  <br>      * Keftedes (Greece): add some breadcrumbs and a little red wine to the meat mixture.<br>      * K?fte (Turkey): add some breadcrumbs and form the meat into a sausage shape on skewers. Oil the meat well and grill over hot coals.<br>      * Before frying, you can roll the kefta in some flour and shake off the extra to help them brown.<br>      * Experiment with different seasonings--coriander, cayenne, sesame seeds.

pMFLqU0Yaa	Classic mashed tater mix-ins include:<br>  <br>  Roasted garlic<br>  Cream cheese and herbs (or just the herbed cream cheese from the market)<br>  Cheddar, crisp, crumbled bacon, sliced green onions and sour cream (mixed in the taters, of course)<br>  Carmelized onions<br>  <br>  Pretty much whatever you think tastes good ON a potato will taste good in your mashed taters, IMO.<br>  <br>  Play with it. Playing with food is fun! I actually get paid to play with food. I'm sooooo lucky!|`|1RTFKnwMaa	Mashed potatoes are wonderful because you can do so much!  You can add just a bit of mayo to make them creamy.  Or, you can mash them with their skins still on for some extra texture (I recommend this most with red skinned potatoes).  Adding cheese (any of your choice, but I prefer shredded cheddar) makes for really good potatoes.  Garlic and many different herbs make wonderful add-ons too!<br>  <br>  Now, something that I personally enjoy doing, is adding barbecue sauce to plain mashed potatoes.  Not too much, just enough to get the flavor good and throughout the potatoes.  You can mix together many of these suggestions, but I recommend using only barbecue sauce if that's the one you go for.  However, who knows?  You might like the barbecue sauce with cheese or with garlic.  Experiment and find out!  <br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful!|`|RO02uqhnaa	Depending on the amount you make, a spoon or two of Horseradish and some sour cream is amazing.

Top with plenty of butter or sour cream.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Use red potatoes, and leave the skins on.Then mash them with grated cheddar cheese and crumbled cooked bacon.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Garlic and Parmesan cheese. YUMMY!|`|v0LWgN33aa	Have you got enough to go skiing on?|`|6SqxGQsqaa	everyone has their own tastes, im more of a simple girl, my ideal mashed potatoes are roasted garlic (garlic roasted with olive oil of course) salt, pepper, butter, and cream. and thats it! trust me, that is thee way to go, you can really taste the simplicity of the potatoes instead of having a mashed version of a baked potato, and its just soo good.|`|nxeQFPEfaa	Well, what do you usually do with them?<br>  <br>  My absolute favorite is loaded. With lots of shredded cheddar, crumbled bacon & a dash of chopped green onion.<br>  <br>  Another fave is with tons of cracked pepper & parmesan cheese.<br>  <br>  Lastly for a pleasant not too "out there" variation mix in a dry packet of ranch dip mix. Its really good.|`|Rl2Jcpqlaa	Use red potatoes, add roasted garlic and cream, -shredded gruyere cheese with some kosher salt, and fresh cracked black pepper on top!|`|AA10732209	I put 2 or 3 garlic gloves in mine or more garlic depending on how much i'm making , my family loves it.|`|BRRyUK1iaa	whole foods used to have a great sour cream and fresh basil mashed potato.<br>  <br>   but, good ole skins on, mashed. with fresh chives is still my fave|`|alIO8ic0aa	I mix a couple eggs, salt & pepper and then fry them to make potato pancakes.|`|icm5gtYnaa	sometimes I boil eggs and them mash them and beat them into the mashed potatoes with mayo........it tastes great!  =]|`|76a2abe8e583e9295d0577810103916baa	Use it as a body scrub
tgUapnKbaa	I love them roasted. Whenever I roast beef, chicken, or turkey I cut up carrots, onion, and celery and add about a quarter inch of broth to my roasting pan and let everything roast together.|`|RO02uqhnaa	I like to quarter them (cut in half long ways once then once across).<br>  Dress them in a little olive oil,salt,pepper and DRY dill and roast them til they are caramelized and done. About 400 degree's|`|NX4LYXkqaa	As a salad u can use you make curry You can make sweet dish too|`|sDKCX43caa	I normally chop into bight sized pieces and steam, lightly salted.<br>  <br>  This looks quite nice if you are looking for something new.<br>  Ingredients:<br>  6 medium carrots, thinly sliced<br>  1 apple, thinly sliced<br>  1 level tablespoon margarine, mono- or poly-unsaturated<br>  1 teaspoon grated lemon rind<br>  2 tablespoons water<br>  1/2 cup reduced fat grated cheese<br>  1 tablespoon chopped parsley<br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  Method:<br>  1. Arrange carrots and apple in alternate layers in saucepan. <br>  2. Dot with margarine, sprinkle with lemon rind and water. <br>  3. Cover, cook over gentle heat until tender about 20 minutes. <br>  4. Sprinkle with cheese, cover, steam further 5 minutes. Serve sprinkled with parsley.|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	kt's answer works.  <br>  You can also cut them in diagonal, uniform slices, then steam them, and add a bit of butter and a little rosemary or other herb.<br>  They always taste wonderful from a pot roast, so you replicate that flavor by cooking them in beef broth with some onion slices, fresh ground pepper.  (You could experiment by adding whatever seasonings you add to pot roast, just in small doses, such as half a bay leaf, some fresh parsley, etc.)<br>  Type "carrot recipes" into your search engine for additional ideas.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	1 bag baby carrots<br>  4 tablespoons butter<br>  1 cup brown sugar<br>  3 cups water<br>  <br>  In a saucepot, steam baby carrots in 3 cups of water until tender.<br>  While carrots are steaming, measure 1 cup of brown sugar into a microwavable container and heat in microwave for 1 minute. Stir.<br>  <br>  Pour sauce over carrots before serving.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have also served them with tomato juice and a sprinkle of Cinammon. Don't knock it till you try it..they're really good that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Butter, salt, pepper, and a few sprigs of fresh dill add a savory flare.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	I love to cut carrots into 2 inch pieces, or use baby carrots, and cook them in a small sauce pan with a few tablespoons of water, a big pinch of salt and pepper, and a big squirt of honey.  When the water cooks off, I add a tablespoon of butter.  DELICIOUS!|`|2LYIMahxaa	You should try mashing them up like potatoes. Slice them in half inch intervals. Cover them with water in a pot, bring them to a boil, then simmer for about 15 minutes. Add sea salt, pepper, a little butter and a pinch of nutmeg after mashing.

0HaDZEhUaa	i'm not sure what you're talking about but i think you can still buy them:
6SqxGQsqaa	lol, its possible, but i dont think so. when i used to work at carls jr i remember going to mcdonalds and bringing it back and eating it at work. lol, no one ever told me anything. but im sure something would be said if you were drinking pepsi at a coke factory.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	It would be tacky - but unless you are an executive, or public representative of the factory - I doubt getting fired would hold up in court.  I'm sure your co-workers and boss would give you a bad time about it.  Some joking, some not.<br>  <br>  But you could get fired for a few other reasons.<br>  <br>  1) You are paid to work, not to stand around and drink soft drinks - do you ever see the cashier at the store drink coke while he/she is checking out your order?  Does a waitress ever drink while she is taking your order?  <br>  <br>  2) If you are working in the actual factory where they make the product - it has to be food safe and sanitary all the time - so health laws prohibit people from eating and drinking when around the production line.|`|pt6wIlS1aa	LOL, I'm a Pepsi fan, too. I doubt that drinking Pepsi would be something they could fire you for. I want to say that employers don't have the right to tell you what you can and cannot eat and drink on your breaks or at lunch, or even at your desk if you have an office job. But what if you were working for a vegetarian food company? Probably they could forbid employees from eating meat on their premises, so why shouldn't other employers be able to restrict people from bringing competitors' products into the workplace? I don't know what the laws are.<br>  <br>  If you're an employee, there should be an employee handbook that tells you what the company policies are. Or you could ask your boss there. <br>  <br>  If you're not an employee, you could email the company and ask.<br>  <br>  My guess is that employees get free Coke products at work but would have to purchase their Pepsi, and that the soda pop machines at Coca- Cola don't carry Pepsi products.|`|NToMH3vkaa	but thats just like eating Mac Ds in burgerking LOL. but if u worked in a coke factory u probibly would get free coke|`|f2uqEIksaa	haha not unless youre a sales rep. or something|`|2LYIMahxaa	My friend told me that he could be fired if he was seen anywhere drinking a Coke when he worked for Pepsi, even if he was not working. So I imaging the same would go if he worked for Coke.
jHcblhmVaa	Don't forget the reds for the other guests.  If her favorite wine is white or blush.  Keep the dinner and appetizers on the light side.  Nothing to bold.  Cheese, crackers, chicken, Think about a fondue as one of the appetizers.

r0xeCZAQaa	It is easy to go from vegetarian to vegan, I think, if you just stop eating animal  products (dairy, eggs, honey, etc)<br>  If you eat natural foods, i.e., if you shop the outside edges of the supermarket (only whole vegetables and fruit), and prepare your meals from scratch, you can be vegan very easily. <br>  <br>  If you are accustomed to eating prepared and packaged foods, including breads, pasta, mixes, frozen foods, etc., you will have to learn to read the ingredients listings of the foods you think look good -- pick up the package, turn it over until you find the ingredient listing (small print listing of everything that is in the product).  You may see names you do not know. Google them or go to Wikipedia to find out what they are. a safe way to know if you want to eat an ingredient is if you can pronounce it (that definitely leaves out things with lots of alphabet letters)<br>  <br>  If you want vegan recipes, go to <a href="http://www.vegweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegweb.com</a> and key in "vegan recipes" or go to <a href="http://www.veganchef.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.veganchef.com/</a> and click on recipes|`|bjgKzYCyaa	Careful on the soy...not very good for you!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skrewtips.com/2008/02/08/oh-soy-bad-how-we-are-mislead-about-the-benefits-of-soy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skrewtips.com/2008/02/08/oh-s...</a>|`|FJpPCVTCaa	congrats on making the transition xD i'm not that decadent of a vegan so i don't know much about processed vegan foods. too expensive for me D: but pineapples are one've my favorite power up foods XD|`|pZjj3adpaa	Most of the products with red food coloring have Red No.4 which is derived from Cochineal Bugs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veggieglobal.com/nutrition/non-vegetarian-food-additives.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.veggieglobal.com/nutrition/no...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Soy is bad for health? they haven't proven it yet. Okinawans, Chinese Japanese, Koreans love Tofu and they have a very healthy body. Okinawans are the the oldest people in the world. it is normal to see someone over 100 years old climbing a tree in Okinawa. They have the lowest rates of breast cancer and prostate cancers and the love soy. The only bad thing that is proven about soy is soy allergies and 60% of US soy production used as Animal food. Imagine that. Most of the world's soy are produced in US and soy has a lot of nutrients. Instead of using it as animal feeds, why not use it to feed billions of hungry and malnourished people? particularly Africa?<br>  <br>  No one said that American, French and Italian Diet are Better than Asian Diet. They are loaded with Fats and trans fats like cheese.<br>  <br>  The only reason why South East Asians and Indians Have low life expectancy is because we have not enough money to have a healthy lifestyle and wide spread epidemias. But if we have all the wealth that the westerns have, we will have a very high life expectancy. higher than westerns.<br>  <br>  Rice is better than bread because rice has good carbohydrates, low calorie, and it is gluten free.<br>  <br>  I'm Asian and I'm proud to be a Filipino.<br>  Wish you can understand my English.

NrJBWdKUaa	When I turned 13 (i'm still 13) i had a sleepover pool party too! It was at my own house though, so I'm not sure if the hotel will let you do a whole lot. I went to a dollar store and bought BIG HUGE bags of assorted candies, and put those in gift bags. I also put blowing bubbles, lufa's (shower things) pencils, chineese finger traps, stuff like that! I had a game, (idk if the hotel will let you do this) but it was were all my friends sat at the picnick tabel with a paper plate in front of them and a gumball in the middle. My mom squirted whiped cream all over the plate and when she said GO, we had to dig for the gumball with our mouths and the first person to blow a bubble won. Hope it's a good party! You will finaly be a 'teenager'!|`|TfOfVRYnaa	Make out and take pictures. Thats what all young girls do at sleepovers|`|icm5gtYnaa	you could just order pizza or make a buffet style dinner.<br>  as for party bags, put candy, jewelry, and makeup! :)<br>  play games and gossip. =]<br>  good luck, and have fun!|`|Y0pFoz4caa	you need all different kinds of chips, hotdogs, burgers, and cotten candy. <br>  u should definatly have both<br>  get some party bags wit candy<br>  music in the now<br>  DJ<br>  Good Luck|`|Sa0W5Lwuaa	get music , take pictures , magazinesss  ; im sure you'll find something to do .

4tC1bCfPaa	Hmmm...I know how you must feel, I want to get an ice cream, but we're gonna go rent a movie, so, I'll just eat the ice cream later.<br>  <br>  I would save it for tomorrow, three reasons why:<br>  <br>  1) You will need it if you are going to wake up that early.<br>  <br>  2) Drinking it right now will give you lots of energy, and you will not be able to go to sleep, and remember (you need to wake up early.)<br>  <br>  3) It tastes better in the morning.|`|5LzhZ6pXaa	Drink it half now and half before boating. If u drink a whole can, not only is it unhealthy, but u will crash hard and be tired tomorrow. If u drink half of it tomorrow, u will have the energy without getting hyper and crashing. Hope I was able to help. =)|`|56yAcQ3Taa	hm...well..<br>  since it has caffeine it will probably give you dreams.<br>  id most likely say tomorrow, but then ul be really tired at like 10 am<br>  i say drink it now, ul get into a deeper  state  ofsleep and be more awake tomorrow<br>  peace<br>  Maddie :)|`|5dUmoDOQaa	i wouldn't drink it. energy drinks give you a boost for about an hour and then you crash. stick with fruits, juices, and protein. but if you really want to drink it, drink it when you are about to go boating.|`|Obv6CdnFaa	if you drink it now then you cant go to sleep cause of the energy boost and you will be tried for tommorow. so save it for the morning.|`|REX2MvVxaa	TOMORROW.
uwEEgZppaa	Yes and the outcome will be a great meal !|`|Bv3Dm11paa	I'm not sure, but personally I would use a separate bag for chicken, you can never be too safe when it comes to raw meat.|`|icm5gtYnaa	I think so, but then the onion might make the chicken also marinated in onion so if that's okay with you, go for it!  =]|`|RO02uqhnaa	It would work fine....the veggies would add flavor to the chicken.

1K8NPRUOaa	catnip might make you feel sick. if you did eat catnip, go and see a doctor immediately.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Are you a cat?|`|GWoW1o5oaa	Catnip can produce a mild euphoria in humans, but it is not harmful to eat.  My guess is it was dried.  It might be expanding in your stomach as it rehydrates as well as reacting with the digestive chemicals causing bloating and gas.  It can happen with large quantities of poorly chewed vegetables.  Take a large glass of water.|`|w9GrWPrTaa	people arent supposed to eat catnip... thats why its called *cat*nip. but no its probably just like messing with your stomache because people dont eat that stuff!|`|5QicX6O4aa	I never tried it, but cats seem to get super high eating catnip.

I season with garlic salt, a bit of oregano. Salt. pepper. and a few dashes of tobasco sauce.<br>  <br>  then i just warm the beans and simmer gently for just a minute or two. Just enough to meld the flavors. Then I let them cool slightly.<br>  <br>  I use the steamer attachment on my rice cooker to soften the tortillas. make them easier to roll up. I have never been good at using a microwave to make mine soft. I always seem to end up drying them out. But once the tortillas are soft and pliable I spread equal amounts of the bean mixture on the tortillas. I top with shredded cheese. and then roll them up.<br>  <br>  If I am going fancy, i add shredded chicken, or precooked rice. Sometimes I make extra rice a day or so ahead and freeze it just for this reason.<br>  <br>  You could add all kinds of your fave ingredients. Whatever you like best. Shredded cooked beef. Tofu... cilantro, sliced olives.<br>  <br>  Then I either lay them out on a baking sheet and warm thru when I am ready or I microwave them one at a time as I need them.<br>  <br>  that usually makes about 4 plain or 5 or so if you make it with chicken and rice. Whats great is, that even when cooked again. the beans dont get nasty and runny. There is still good texture and a good flavor.<br>  <br>  on a really fancy night I will make home made green pork chili and smother them in the chili. I then slather on the sour cream and the shredded lettuce with more cheese, diced tomato and diced avacado|`|RO02uqhnaa	Black beans....definitely|`|2Pi6bJofaa	Personally I love kidney beans on just about everything :)|`|AA12281294	pinto beans and black beans.|`|n6uydCoYaa	pinto and/or black beans|`|AA11091315	Black=best beans|`|yXno8yIkaa	I use beef, onion, refried beans, tomato sauce and cheese, hot sauce and spices too.
Fyd0CaqTaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I remember those days, when I had to make a few parties and was ready to give birth anyday after that. And to think of it I do have 4 so I have been busy. Ok this is a MUST you have to follow every inch of the instructions. <br>  <br>  Get a box of Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Classic Yellow cake; this is what we going to do after. <br>  <br>  1. You are going to preheat the oven at 350′F if you are using a metal pan but if you are using a glass pan then preheat at 325′F<br>  2. In a clean bowl pour 1 box of Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Classic Yellow cake then you going to put in 1 1/3 cup of tap water then, 1/3 cup of vegetable oil and now 3 large eggs. After you get all that in the bowl mix well by hand try to get all the lumps out, if you cant don’t worry, you are going to mix it for 10 minutes after that set aside for a moment.<br>  3. Grease your pan all over with butter or shortening then put 2 tablespoon of white plan flour in the pan as well and move it all over that is called dusting so the cake don’t stick to the pan. <br>  4. Now take your cake mix batter and pour it in the greased and dusted pan. Now bake for 15 minutes or till done, all you have to do to cake if done is to stick a tooth pick in the middle of the cake and if it comes out clean it is DONE!.<br>  5. When done you can to places it on a rack to cool down for 15 minutes before you frost it.<br>  <br>  Now you can put what ever forsting you want.<br>  <br>  I do hope this works for you. I am sure your husband will be excited when he sees that you did this all on your own and I am sure it is going to be tasty because, just going out of your way to do this is wonderful. Best wishes to your husband for his birthday and good luck with everything take care and Happy cooking!!!!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Make sure the pan is greased and floured well ..... Let it cool for at least 10 min, before turning the pan upside down.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Follow the instructions to the tee. Really grease your pan well... I use Pam cooking spray, and my cakes always come out well. Check the center of the cake with a toothpick before removing it. If it comes out clean, the cake is done. Make sure you let the cake cool for about ten minutes before you attempt to remove it from the pan. Loosen around the edges with a knife first.|`|icm5gtYnaa	you can try adding a teeny bit of extra water to the mix to make it more moist, if that's what you want. just check the cake with a toothpick to make sure it's ready and use a good amount of cooking spray. I line the bottom of the pan with wax paper so that it definitely comes out and doesn't break.  =]|`|c94c80587af5eed796ab6a66f276df15aa	to keep it from getting stuck make sure you butter/grease the bottom of the pan really well and then also put flour on the pan. this will keep it from sticking|`|Dil6DihTaa	Betty Crocker always works for me. Just make sure you follow the directions exacty and grease the pan! Good Luck! :)|`|4d80afe3510fcec9f8c8cce72cafd379aa	Follow the directions-don't try to change it to make it unique.  Make sure you grease your pan really well and then cover it in a light coating of flour (throw in some flour, shake it around, and dump whatever didn't stick).  You can also take parchment paper and cut out a shape that fits the bottom of your pan (just the bottom).  Put that on top of the butter and flour and when it's time to take your cake out just run a knife around the edges and it should come out easily.  Check your cake before the minimum time.  If your oven runs hot you'll burn it or overcook it before you hit the minimum time so it's best to check early.  Check it with a toothpick-when it's mostly clean and not gooey it's done.  You don't have to wait until absolutely no crumbs stick to it.

4Zd1cQXaaa	If you actually enjoy the flavour of an alcohol, there is no reason to cover it up.  I think most people use vodka because it's neutral, and easily masked, and jello shooters are usually meant to be eaten quickly, with little concern for well being, so anything doesn't taste absolutely terrible is ok.  If you were using Southern comfort, I would use Lime Jell-O (make sure it's Jell-O brand), and add some lime juice in with the liquor.  Alternatively, you could use orange Jell-O, and an orange liquer to compliment the flavour.  <br>  <br>  Hope your party goes well! Cheers|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Uhhh, don't do that... jello shots should only be made with vodka, which has a neutral flavor.

Great fruits to use are bananas, berries (including strawberries and blackberries), pineapples, mangos, and/or kiwi.<br>  <br>  Second, add an ingredient to the smoothie as a thickener. Good choices include low-fat yogurt, low-fat frozen yogurt, a can of frozen juice concentrate, frozen fruit, or a cup of ice. How much of these ingredients you will use depends on how thick you want your smoothie to be.<br>  <br>  Third, you will need a liquid so everything will blend smoothly. You can add skim milk, soy milk, fruit juice or even water (some smoothie makers use flavored water). Start with 1/4 cup and then add more if needed.<br>  <br>  An extra option to enhance flavor is to add a sweetner, cinnamon or vanilla extract.<br>  <br>  A good rule of thumb for the ingredient measurements is to make your smoothie with 1 part fruit, 1 part liquid, and 2 parts thick base. For example: for 1 smoothie (a little over 1 cup), you would use 1/4 cup fruit, 1/4 cup liquid, and 1/2 cup thickener. But these measurements are not set in stone. The great thing about smoothies is you can experiment to get exactly what you want!<br>  <br>  Put all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Serve immediately or refrigerate. You may want to serve in a chilled glass if serving immediately.|`|RO02uqhnaa	I drink this almost everyday for breakfast.<br>  1 banana<br>  1 cup yogurt(i like plain for the tang)<br>  1 package instant oatmeal<br>  1 scoop vanilla whey protien<br>  1 tbsp flax seed oil(optional)<br>  1 cup frozen berries of your choice<br>  Skim milk til desired consistency is achieved.<br>  <br>  It is a LARGE smoothie, but I'm a pretty big guy, so the recipe could easily be cut in half.

Painted ornaments will need to be sealed with clear varnish.<br>  <br>        Store your salt dough in a sealed container in the refrigerator, but usually not more than a couple of days.

Any large predatory fish will have a certain amount of mercury in its body, because they eat other fish which also have mercury.  Skipjacks have a relatively short lifespan (compared to other species of tuna) and so will have less opportunity to build up mercury in their tissues.  The older and larger a fish grows, the more mercury will accumulate in its tissues.

Add an egg white or two and mix until incorporated.<br>  <br>  Chop some Fresh basil (fresh is much better than dried for this).  Basil is a must, I also use some fresh parsely when I have it on hand, definitely adds to the flavor.<br>  <br>  Mix the chopped herbs in with the cheese, then fold in the cooked spinach. Stir together until all of the ingredients are mixed thouroughly.  Stuff into cooked pasta shells.  Cover with a bit of red sauce, bake at 375 for 20 minutes or so.
