20090205163755AAhP2mC	Health;Optical	Transitions lenses trouble?	My father recently purchased Transitions lenses from a provider here in Maine. At first things were great. With in a few weeks, he noticed a small imperfection inside the glass. It looked as though there was foil inside the glass, and that the foil was crinkling up. It got worse, and showed up on both lenses, in several spots. We took them back to the provider and they insisted that my father had scratched the glass, although this imperfection is CLEARLY not on the surface of the lens. They refused to replace, fix or refund the glasses and my father has worn them, with these crinkles for almost two years. I know it effects his vision, gives him headaches, etc. He paid a pretty penny for these glasses- for the whole visit and new glasses it was about $500 dollars- and we would like to know if we can make either the Transitions company or the eye care provider to come good on this deal.    Any suggestions?    Oh, and I've looked at Transitions.com, did the "ask a professional" thing, there is no Contact Us or Customer Service... so I dont know how to contact them.

Yesterday, from 2 in the afternoon until I went to bed last night, the skin of my cheeks felt like they were on fire. It felt like being embarrassed/being sunburnt, b/c they were red, hot to the touch, and felt like they were on fire. For all intents and purposes, it looked like I was blushing, but there was no emotional part behind it. So please don't tell me I was embarrassed, b/c I wasn't. It came on suddenly and thankfully went away sometime during the night, but who knows what it was and if it will come back? If you guys have any suggestions, please let me know.

20090205170046AAziAbY	Health;Diet & Fitness	How does training on the hardest difficulty with a stationary bike affect your body?	I often cycle on a stationary bike using a difficulty (around level 8-10) which I can ride at 40-50kph comfortably and can go over 65kph in short bursts. I can ride this way for at least an hour if i really push myself so you can see it isn't extremely difficult.      The other day, I decided to try going on max difficulty (which is level 16 on my bike) for a little while. My aim was to give everything I had for 30 seconds. For the first 20 seconds, I rode between 40 and 45kph. For the next 10 seconds, I cycled at over 45kph. I pushed myself to the absolute limit here and had to get off the bike immediately. Straight away, my legs tightened up and I could barely stand my legs felt that weak. I had a shower and once i got out (which was something like 20 minutes after I finished riding), my legs still felt really weak and I could barely climb the stairs.      This got me thinking..    If I can cycle at level 8 for 30-60 minutes, I can increase my fitness and aerobic endurance.    How does the body respond to cycling as fast as you can on the hardest difficulty for 30 seconds? Does this improve leg strength, or muscular endurance..??      Could someone please help me figure this out?   Thanks heaps in advance.

Well, basically I always feel VERY compelled to do this... everytime I am alone I result to this. I walk frantically around the house and I put on my Ipod on as loud as it can go. For some reason I "daydream" but I am very much awake and I am still walking around the house. I fantasise about many things but I'm either having a lot of fun and with friends or sometimes I fantasise that I am badly injured and my family and friends are worried and it seems like they really care about me. I sometimes do this for hours and I also do it everyday. I have this weird compulsion to do it and my "conscience daydreaming" (if thats what you call it) seems so vivid and life-like. I have no idea why I do it but it always involves music and me walking back and forth around the house. I look forward to doing that most of the time. I honestly have no idea why I do it or if I am the only one who does. If you can help me in any way to tell me why you think I do it, or help me understand the reason behind why I do it, or how can I stop, I would greatly appreciate it. I know this is a really odd request but I've never asked anyone before I know I'm weird but thank you soo much! :]

20090205170026AAojvOL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	I had sex with a guy on jan 1, 2009. I took a std test on jan 16, 2009! On jan 23 my dr said i tested positive?	for type 2 herpes. Is it possible my antibodies build up that much to register on the blood test? I thought it took a month to 3 month for antibodies to test positive on the blood test.      I tested positive for type 1 herpes 6 months ago. I figured i would add that in. The only reason of why i tested for std's was cause i was going to sleep with a new partner. Thank gosh i found out i tested positive before i had sex with this new guy. I would of felt really guilty if i had sex with him and then found out i was positive.      I have had other partners to but i am just trying to figure out if it was this guy. Cause of the antibodies. Thanks every one.

Age: 15   Gender: Male      My parents left, I decided it'd be a good time to quickly do it   So I found a video, and got to work   I was right there about to finish when I hear the unlocked door start to open, and all hell breaks loose in my mind   I tried to apple+q and quit it ASAP, but firefox has to confirm a quit   So the door opens, and I am beyond scared, so I just mute, go to iTunes and browse around      But now I'm scared if I got caught...

20060630153410AAdaI3T	Health;Mental Health	For teenage girls!?	I have a webpage up that has advice for teenage girls (even mentions cutting) from an American pychologist (Dr Mary Pipher) who only works with teenage girls. Please let me know what you think of it and any suggestions you have. It takes only 3 minute to read.    Also it is an American perspective or view so if you are outside of America, does it apply to your society? Do girls outside of America cut themselves? How come boys do not cut themselves? If you have very good advice, I can add it to this webpage so many teenage girls can see it, especially since it is only 3 minutes of reading now (but it is the best info from her whole book).    http://phifoundation.org/teen.html
20060630080004AAOsJDD	Health;Other - Health	Blistered tattoo???	I'm in the process of having a tattoo removed.  I've had 3 treatments.  The last treatment I had hurt a lot worse than the other two, and the nest day when I woke up and took off the banage, the WHOLE tattoo is a giant blister.  It's so big that I'm afraid if I move my ankle the wrong way it's going to pop.  I called the doctors, and they said that it's normal, and to just keep it covered.

20060703222003AA4c08k	Health;Mental Health	My situation?? I have anxiety and depression!?	I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Last yr I started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and iv'e been on zoloft ever since. well, recently I stopped seeing my therapist because she wasn't really helping me, and I'd always get frustrated when I saw her. on top of that I stopped taking my zoloft because I kept forgetting. Now i feel so stupid, because I have absolutely no motivation to do anything good for myself. I don't call people or go out or do anything, and on top of that I don't even try to make myself presentable when I go out. I am trying to take the zoloft every day again but I have a feeling it'll take a few weeks to kick back in. What should I do in the meantime to make myself feel okay and motivated? I haven't seen my therapist in over a month, but like I said, when I see her I get frustrated, and I'd feel bad if I asked to see a new one. I need feedback!

I have never been with a man before that I could not somehow reason with or to see the other side of something, but when he made his mind up there was NO reasoning with him whatsoever. Everything was like black and white to him. There was NO middle of the road. He even said to me after I tried rationally and calmly  to make him reconsider  about splitting up with me after 6 years that "Everything you have just said makes sense, but we are still breaking up"!  Is this a narcissist type of behaviour? He could be SO immature! He is 52! I felt as though I was banging my head against a wall.He never gave me a valid reason for separating. He was supposedly the love of my life. He acted like I was no fun anymore or he was bored and wanted to move on to the next thing.And of course he had a new woman almost immediatley .All he kept telling me was "I Just want to be alone."  Is  this behaviour some sort of mental illness?

20060804060355AAbS320	Health;Diet & Fitness	Body fat Vs Belly fat. Any experience?	I'm trying to lose my belly and love handles, but I dont know if I'm doing the right thing. I'm exercizing almost daily, gym (30 min) and on the weekend I have a vigorous kayaking activity for at least 2 hours on saturdays. I also go hiking for 3 days occasionally but I walk for 3 days in a row 7 hours a day. Now what is happeneing here, is that I went from 235 lbs to 199 lbs in 6 months but my belly is still there. Love handles too. I hate both of them, and I'm not really motivated to do more exercize cause I lost so much weight but the belly is still there! Am I losing body fat like gradually from the whole body and not losing it from my belly? What will my belly goes away? More exercize? What can I do to lose more fat from my belly? My diet is ok...not restraining too much but avoiding crap like fastfood, sodas, chips, fats and sugar treats like bars or chocolate. Thanx!

Ciao,      in qualche post precedente scrissi d'un problema all'orecchio. V'era un tappo di cerume che, pian piano, s'è tolto via (con il Debrox maggiormente ma anche con la pulizia parziale fatta dall'otorino). Quest'oggi sono andato dall'otorino e ha detto che è pulito e non c'è più il tappo. Eppure io sento sempre la sensazione di "attappamento" (anche se in forma più lieve) che avevo prima.       Mi ha prescritto il Fluimicil 600 in bustine per 10/15 gg presumendo possa essere catarro. Voi che ne pensate? avete avuto esperienze analoghe?

20060725104407AAdVcPC	Health;Mental Health	A dream I had?	Hi everyone, I had a dream last night about my deceased grandmother who passed away over a year ago. The dream felt VERY real, like I was back at her house up north, same setting, same living room, etc. I saw her come up to me, in the dream, and I asked her how she was and she said was she doing fine and asked how I was, and it felt very real. She told me she was doing fine and everything would be ok, and asked me about my career and told me to stay with it. I hugged her but I didn't touch her, it was like she was a ghost.      At the end of the dream, my grandmother's face slowly faded and then a lady I had seen at a store earlier in the day appeared and kind of faded in to where my grandmom was standing at the door, which was WEIRD. Now, I remember talking about my grandmom earlier in the day, but sometimes I do dream about her from time to time.      Does it seem this could have been real contact in a dream, or just me thinking of her and then dreaming this? never had this before.

20060813144531AA4gVfb	Health;Diet & Fitness	I am 28 and I had gall bladder surgery done in early July and now I have gained weight.Wat is this so?	Firstly, right after my laproscopy (gall bladder surgery) I switched to a light diet such as soupy noodles, brown rice and bland porridge and in smaller portions too. It was more for health than aesthetic reasons that I do so and I have no problems with my new diet. I am also not a fan of the Atkins Diet; I believe in eating well nutritioned meals rich in veges,fruits and less of fats. However, despite the almost fat-less diet,I have gained more weight than before my surgery.A few chinese friends told me it is water retention and my doc says its from gas that causes the bloatedness, hence the appearance of looking fat.Both says it will take a few months for the water/gas to go away.As such,I was advised by all not to exercise b'cos my body is still recovering from the internal wounds.Before my surgery I was never an exercise person but I figured I wanna work out after the surgery to get back into the pink of health.So if it isn't the new diet or exercise,what is causing my weight gain?

20060831200140AAYYTqi	Health;Diet & Fitness	Question about weight gain/loss..?	I have a screwed up eating cycle... where I eat pretty much nothing all day (no appetite from habit/anxiety), but at night..  I'm very hungry and eat quite a bit.  However, there's still no way I'm eating 2000 calories in a day .. which I presume I'm also burning.      Therefore, the question is..   if I'm eating at night and then going to sleep, is that going to turn into fat since I'm not going to burn much while sleeping - or will my body still burn it off to compensate for the lack of calories earlier in the day?  I was under the presumption that eating less calories than you burn = loss of weight.

Ciao,      da un po' di tempo, vedo che in certi momenti della giornata (la mattina appena svegliato e la sera) la vista si fa meno nitida. Sembra come se faticassi (e non poco) a mettere a fuoco quanto è lontano.       Premetto che, per di più, ho l'occhio sinistro pigro (così lo chiamano) e quindi tende già di suo a "lavorare" poco. Vorrei far qualcosa per tentare di aver più sollievo e non avere questi fastidi. Ho provato tempo fa, circa un'anno fa, ad andare da un oculista ma non mi ha dato alcuna terapia, alcuna prescrizione di lenti... Al sinistro mancheranno un paio di gradi mentre al destro sembra di ricordare che sia OK. Che faccio? vado dall'oculista (magari un altro) o vado direttamente dall'ottico (dove certo fanno anche visite)?      In tutta franchezza, l'affaticamento visivo (e le difficoltà che citavo) non sono costanti. Mettendo degli occhiali, potrei risolvere, secondo voi?      Grazie e ciao,

20090203044737AAb5SUM	Health;Mental Health	Why is it so scary when a balloon pops? I have been afraid of popping balloons all my life. How do I fix me?	Can I be fixed.  I am tense when I see balloons that are over filled, I feel sad/angry/depressed when I see one that has already been popped.  It makes me very tense and I feel like my heart is going to jump out of my chest when they are popped.  I wish I didn't feel like this, it is just a stupid balloon.  I can't pop one because I am too afraid.  I really don't want to tell anyone I know about that and no one really knows how it makes me feel.  I usually walk away or find an excuse to leave when I know they are going to pop, and if one does pop, I hide how it makes me feel.  They really scare me bad and it was hard to hide, but I have learned to deal with it enough to where I can hide it a little to where no one notices.  It still scares the hell out of me and I can never pop one, not that I want to, but in my job, I run across one once in a while that I have to get rid of because it is somewhere it shouldn't be.  I manage to pop them with something sharp, but it is hard to do that and leaves me very tense, nervous,  and sad for a while.  I don't want anyone I know I am afraid.  Any advise besides something like "man-up."  I assure you I am afraid of nothing else, but I am shy around girls.  I will never back down from any man however.  I am a small town southern man, I just have that one problem.

Does anybody agree that it should be banned, deleted, or anything they'llll take it off the internet? I think it needs to be removed as soon as possible. Anorexia Nervosa is, as doctors say, a disease caused inside the human brain. When the person affected looks into the mirror, they see a bigger person than they actually are. So why has somebody MADE a website on How To Be Anorexic? If people want to loose wieght, perhaps they should cut out chocolate, go to weight watchers, or something healthy. Wanting to be anorexia isnt normal - my apologise if that affects people or upsets them - but it is not, and if people actually go to that website looking for /help/ then they should consult a doctor. The person who created that website is proberly responsible - though I doubt they even realise it! - of the deaths of many people, including young girls, only thirteen years old. Its completely disgusting, that website.    Does anybody agree/disagree? State your reasons too, please.

20090203052239AAV4eua	Health;Alternative Medicine	ABOUT COFFEE ENEMAS...?	ABOUT COFFEE ENEMAS:      Recently I have become deeply fascinated with cleansing & enemas (I'm on a self-designed, very detailed multi-layered cleansing regimen from yesterday until April 1st, & last year I successfully completed an 18-day Master Cleanse), and coffee enemas sound awesome!  Problem is, I'm moderately - severely caffeine intolerant (spawned from the unholy union of bulimia + habitual caffeine overdose back in High School, but I digress).  I typically check labels very carefully for caffeine content, & I don't even drink anything "decaf", as it will severely injure my stomach, which now has a thinner lining due to my shenanigans in younger years.  I am 29 years old & have boycotted anything with caffeine since I was 17.  How likely is it that my stomach will be harmed should I decide to take my coffee the other end instead?      BTW, some of you may make some sort of correlation between my juvenile eating disorder & my current cleansing adventure - no worries, as I'm entering this endeavor with a clear & healthy mindset as a fully conscious adult, & I'm constantly researching nutrition so that I can do everything safely as well as effectively.  Eating disorders are SO high school...LOL!  Thanx in advance for all your help!

Okay I've been monitoring for months now because I found my "anxiety" is mainly caused my blood sugar changes.     Anything under 80 makes me shaky, my chest tight and my heart rate fast. This is normal though, I know. But I've had readings as low as 50 after 2 hours of eating so the doctor said I'm hypoglycemic.     On the other hand I've had reading (only once or twice) that go around 140. Anything over 100 and I'm "anxious" tight chest. Racy heart and loud heartbeat. Is that normal ?    & lastly, immediately after I eat my blood sugar drops about 20-30 points and I feel it. It's horrible. I hate eating because of it. Is this also normal, and if not what the heck could that be ?    I've read reactive hypoglycemic issues occur 1-2 hours after eating and that blood sugar should only go up after eating.     Can a person be acclimated to low blood sugar so slightly high reading (~100) give them the same feelings as low blood sugar ?          Anything would help. Thank you.

20090203054831AA10sJF	Health;Diet & Fitness	What's the difference between women who have bigger shoulders and ones with smaller shoulders?And more?	I mean some women have flatter body and bigger shoulders even with small bust ex.Kate Bosworth, Cameron Diaz, Keira Knightley and some bigger bust but small shoulders ex. Scarlett Johansson, Kate Beckinsale. Some big shoulders and big bust ex. Angelina Jolie, Lindsay Lohan, And some with small shoulders and small bust Mena suvari, Kelly Clarkson.   Others have combinations like:small shoulders & bust but both bigger comparing to the rest of the body ex.Sandra Bullock, Pink   Others big bust and shoulders but smaller comparing to the rest of the body ex. Jessica Alba, Charlize Theron      Some of all the above have stronger arms,hands & legs (ex. Adriana Lima)   or stronger tummy and pelvis (ex. britney spears)      With men is more simple(i think) but women have many different combinations.      So my question is, is this all about DNA or it depends on what you eat & how you live?   How do we define "Healthy Body" if there are so many different ones and if the one that is healthy for you is unhealthy for someone else?    (ex.If a woman has too thin weist it will be unhealthy to put 2-3inches only there with some way though a woman who had always big tummy it will be wrong to take it all out with liposuction)

20090203055324AA0Efpx	Health;Mental Health	My bf is ill, has begun to smoke weed again, what should i do?	my long term boyfriend of 4 years began smoking weed about 2 years into our relationship. he smoked it every day for around 6-8 months whilst we lived together. when he could not get hold of any from his contacts, he would get angry and talk about it all day, the next morning he would try again and would carry on this cycle until he got hold of some. sometimes i would smoke some with him too but not very often. he then moved to university which put strain on our relationship as we could not see each other as often. he carried on smoking weed for a couple of months into university and then stopped. he had stopped for about a year now and during last year he displayed symptoms of bipolar. so he got diagnosed properly and is on medication to keep his moods calm. i dont know if the weed had anything to do with his personality changes. so now he has begun speaking with his old friend and has gotten high twice in two weeks. and wants to do it a few times a month. but i told him i werent happy with this as i know he will want to buy it regularly. he is very difficult and doesnt respect my opinion on this. i love him and i have told him i will leave if he does it and that i am not interested in it anymore, he told me i was making idle threats and to stop being stupid. i know i am silly for sticking by him as he gives me no consideration, he says he should have a free choice to do what he wants. he always wants things on his terms and gets angry if he doesnt get his own way. what are your thoughts?

So i went to the clinic a few weeks ago and  i had Bacterial Vaginosis. It was nothing to me because i've had it before but they gave me a 3 day supposatory and i could have sex after he medicine was done. This time the clinic gave me oral medicine called metronidazole tablets. i didnt really read the paper they gave to me (silly me!!) and i began to take the medicine. Yesterday was my first day taking the pills and today i had sex. The paper says not to have sex until 10 days AFTER the medicine is completed. with me having sex before the medicine was complete, will i have to stop the medication or will i get sick. Most importantly will the medication be unaffective? Or because i had sex so early in the medication, will it not really affect it?
