IPoaeWXPaa	Very weird, sounds like it was probably the random red drink you drank.<br>  Could have just been one of those weird nights though when ur body can't handle it whereas usually it can handle ALOT more lol!!<br>  By the way, cider and Jack Daniels...you sound like my kind of girl!!|`|cb7bdc5ff397b28d0e2312a0800253a8aa	how old are u,just b careful when u drink next time,stick 2 one drink an c how you get on,if you still black out its time 2 give it up chick,im not being mean,im in aa me self an thats how it started for me|`|TCpWVW4Raa	Well you had cider, rum, vodka and whisky.. That's a nice mix by itself sounds like you were just drunk to me.|`|Cw0OjQU0aa	It could have been or you could just be more sensitive, do you drink regualrly?|`|sr7jX2wYaa	I honestly  think it was the mixing of  the different alcoholic beverages, & it  suddenly  hit your  system like a poison, causing you to throw up. Everyone's metabolism  is  different, & that could be why your friends  did not  get  sick  even  though  they had everything  to drink you did, except  the mistake. That could  of mentally caused you distress &  to react physically since  you  had  already consumed plenty of  other beverages. I honestly  don't think the  drink  was spiked, for the  fact  you said  it wasn't yours & you picked it up by accident, No one  could of  known you would  do that to spike it*|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Yeah very possibly - drink spiking is now quite common. The best advice I can give you is never to leave sight of your own drink and don't drink anything offered to you by someone else, even if you know that person.  Don't ever go to the loo and leave your drink on the side.  Take it with you.<br>  <br>  Don't want to alarm you but what happened to you could easily have lead to 'rape' or worse.<br>  <br>  Take extra care and stay close with friends whom you know you can trust.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I'm sure you just had too much to drink and that's what made you sick. Maybe you had something dodgy to eat and this caused it. You would know if you had been spiked as you would just not remember anything at all.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	Never drink wine with spirits  the grain and the grape dont mix!  It may have been spiked so be careful.|`|Mw8RehZOaa	doubt it, youve mixed ur drinks and thats the end result. be more careful in future|`|v1uNUcwCaa	well if you are used to drinking that much at once then it sure sounds like that red drink was spiked... <br>  it wasnt your drink in the first place... <br>  so it probably wasnt meant for you. <br>  <br>  i speak from experience coz both me and another friends drink got spiked on my best friends 21st bday. i can remember everything up until about 10pm. we started at 8pm in the local and then we got a taxi to the club, we had just arrived at the clubs VIP bar... then the next thing i knew i was in my best friends flat and she was wiping this brown sick off me... it was also 2 hours later. i hadnt drank all the spiked drink so i wasnt too bad. my other friend had drank all hers (down in 1) was in a worse state than me.<br>  <br>  i must warn you to be more careful next time you are out. this is what i always try remember now...<br>  <br>  if you didnt buy the drink or you didnt see it being bought for you dont drink it. <br>  if someone offers to buy you a drink go to the bar with them so you can see theres nothing put in it. <br>  and take your drinks with you when you go to the toilet ect...<br>  <br>  a couple date-rape type drugs will make you throw-up some vile brown coloured stuff...at some point. (luckly my friends had saw the guy who did it and looked after us and reported him so he got arrested). <br>  <br>  if you threw up some vile brown stuff then you may have been spiked with Rohypnol (im not sure how you spell it) chances are you may start having dodgy flash-backs coz we did.

Whd6tqLzaa	Nope. You can line the pan outside with the alum. foil (for cheese cakes) but not inside. <br>  <br>  Use parchment or wax paper. Trace your pan, cut the paper into circles, place them on your greased pan and make sure to grease the paper circles. You can find wax or parchment paper in the corner grocery.<br>  <br>  If you grease your pan well, you don't really need the lining. For cakes as big as 10 inches or more, its wise to use a liner. The cake will come out of the pan without any trouble.<br>  Good luck.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	No don't use foil. If you don't have wax or parchment paper then just use shorteing and a light dusting of flour.<br>  <br>  The foil will  stick to the cake and leave tiny bits of metal in the cake.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Please don't even go there. Grease your cake tin well with butter, and what I do extra is dust it over the butter with all purpose flour, and discard the remainder, add your cake batter as normal. Once cooked allow to cool to lets say a manageable handling heat, use a knife carefully around the sides, if you greased the pan properly. you should be able to carefully turn it out onto a cake rack and allow it to cool. before you start to dress it.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|QXQWDw1qaa	NO... unless it's an Angel Food cake you can just spray the pan with PAM or any food spray and then dust it with flour.|`|AA11786341	foil would make tha cake bake too fast dont do it<br>  <br>  just greas the pan liberally and maybe flour it,too|`|1jIzBUkhaa	don't do that , it will effect the cooking <br>  use wax paper <br>  or just oil and flour your pan|`|LQt5Au13aa	either spread the pan with butter or coat it very well with some pam (cooking spray)|`|Cw0OjQU0aa	They didn't listen^^^<br>  <br>  JUst grease with butter
ozWi3TJlaa	In 1802, the  Oxford English Dictionary  defined Hamburg steak as salt beef. It had little resemblance to the hamburger we know today. It was a hard slab of salted minced beef, often slightly smoked, mixed with onions and breadcrumbs. The emphasis was more on durability than taste.<br>  <br>  Immigrants to the United States from German-speaking countries brought with them some of their favorite foods. One of them was Hamburg Steak. The Germans simply flavored shredded low-grade beef with regional spices, and both cooked and raw it became a standard meal among the poorer classes. In the seaport town of Hamburg, it acquired the name Hamburg steak. Today, this hamburger patty is no longer called Hamburg Steak in Germany but rather "Frikadelle," "Frikandelle" or "Bulette," orginally Italian and French words.|`|8WM0Q46Maa	Well originally it started as a steak in a small port city called "Hamburg"<br>  it was called the Hamburg Steak.Which was made out of meats such as beef or lamb. Then later through time the burger was developed and they used the Hamburg steaks for what we now call patties, thus giving us Hamburger :]|`|5p2cDupSaa	They used to be made out of ham until someone discovered cow meat.|`|4ie1yCnZaa	idk sometimes they are called beef burgers|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	its weird huh.<br>  Many people name things that are acutally the total oppossite!<br>  trying to make things interesting, and make your brain work..<br>  =)<br>  hehe.<br>  =D
sOpIMeJSaa	Sea Food Gumbo:<br>  SEAFOOD LOVER'S GUMBO  <br>  <br>  Once-a-year expensive but freezes well and makes enough for later. Moderately Low Sodium<br>  <br>  You will need a very large heavy pot (at least 2 gallon) for this recipe!!<br>  <br>  Quantities and kinds of seafood can be amended to account for taste, availability and pocketbook without damaging the recipe.<br>  <br>  SEAFOOD:<br>  <br>  1 lb. fresh white fish, cut into 1 inch chunks (any firm white fish will do)<br>  2 lbs. fresh shrimp, heads & shells removed & used for fish stock)<br>  2 lbs. fresh lump crabmeat with shell fagments removed<br>  2 pts. fresh oysters<br>  1 lg. can (approx. 2 cups) baby clams, strained (use juice for fish stock)<br>  8 c. basic fish or seafood stock<br>  <br>  VEGGIES:<br>  <br>  2 c. onion, chopped<br>  2 lg. cloves garlic, minced<br>  2 c. fresh celery, chopped<br>  2 c. fresh sweet bell pepper, chopped<br>  2 c. sliced fresh okra<br>  1 lg. can (approx. 1 lb.) canned whole tomatoes, crushed & drained<br>  2 c. tomato sauce<br>  6 c. white rice, cooked<br>  1 c. butter<br>  <br>  SPICES:<br>  <br>  4 tsp. gumbo file powder<br>  2 tsp. ground red (cayenne) pepper<br>  2 tsp. white pepper<br>  2 tsp. ground black pepper<br>  2 tsp. sweet paprika<br>  1 tsp. dried thyme leave<br>  1 tsp. dried oregano leaves<br>  1 bay leaf, crushed<br>  2 tsp. Tabasco sauce<br>  <br>  BASIC FISH OR SEAFOOD STOCK: this is best prepared ahead of time. At my house, over the year, whenever we have seafood or fish, fish bones, and shells from crabs, shrimp, and occasionally lobster are boiled for stock and frozen. When making the stock, always boil the discards for 12 to 36 hours, depending on your schedule, etc. then remove and strain the broth to remove the solids. Return the liquid to the pot and boil to reduce until very concentrated. The volume will be determined by the amount of time you have to devote to the task, but I always try to reduce it to about 1/4 the original volume. The resulting stock has concentrated flavor and can be reconstituted with water to meet the need. Freezes well.<br>  <br>  GUMBO: Combine the seasonings in a small bowl and set aside. In the large pot melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, bell pepper and garlic. Cook these until they start to get soft, stirring constantly. Increase the heat to high and stir in the seasoning mix and okra. Cook 6 minutes stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium and add the tomatoes and tomato sauce. Continue cooking for 5 minutes stirring constantly. During this time, the mixture will want to stick to the bottom of the pan. Continually scrape the pan bottom with a spoon. The scrapings will add to the flavor of the gumbo as well as decrease the file powder's ability to thicken. Add the stock and bring the gumbo to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. When the time is up, add the seafood and cover the pot. Allow to sit covered for about 10 minutes before serving. Serve over the rice. Serves 12.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Definitely.  I love fish tacos.

I made some the other day. I made them with one avocado, chopped zucchini and squash, onions, peppers, and various seasonings like hot pepper flakes, parsley, cayenne pepper, etc. I put the chopped up veggies in a pan of vegetable spread on low heat for about 5-7 Min's. Then add some kind of sauce. It might sound a little out of place in a fajita but I used pasta sauce. You can't even recognized the flavor, but you need something thick to keep them juicy, but you can use some other type of sauce that you like. Cook them for about 10-15 Min's and let them simmer for a bit. Heat up your wraps and you're ready for some tasty meatless fajitas!

For the best quality vodka mixer, get orange juice and Red Bull for the orange julius flavor. <br>  <br>  Vodka And A Mixer<br>  Orange Juice is a tried-and-true vodka mixer. Don't get the cheap stuff. Simply Orange Juice makes a great screwdriver. I prefer high pulp, but that's up to you. <br>  <br>  White Grape Pomegranate juice masks vodka particularly well. Welch's sells it if you can find it. It's easy to drink even a half-juice-half-vodka mixture of this. <br>  <br>  Red Bull is the staple of the younger club crowd. This is what I drink in bars because it's easy to swallow, has caffeine to perk me up, and tastes consistent wherever I go. <br>  <br>  Sugar Free Rockstar is my energy drink vodka mixer of choice when I'm at home. It comes in 16 ounce cans and is cheaper than Red Bull. <br>  Mountain Dew takes some getting used to. The "Dewdriver" is a little bitter at first, but I always end up craving another. <br>  <br>  Sprite has a nice taste that makes it a good mixer with vodka. <br>  <br>  Vodka And Multiple Mixers<br>  Orange Juice and Red Bull taste like an orange julius. Add vodka to a glass, then fill 90% with orange juice, and 10% Red Bull. This is probably the best vodka mixed drink I've tasted. <br>  <br>  Peach Schnapps and Orange Juice with vodka, otherwise known as a hairy navel, is a sweet drink that's good to sip on. <br>  <br>  Apple Pucker with an apple flavored vodka and some sweet and sour mix is all you need for an Appletini. These super-sweet drinks are great for small parties. <br>  <br>  Hope these help!|`|I8iKjRkBaa	I love Bloody Mary's. Tomato juice and vodka with a splash of Worcestershire sauce and salt.

BhFeii5Xaa	Yes, you can use the shells but they break too when I cook them too much before stuffing. <br>  <br>  Simmer your manicotti for just long enough for it to get un stiff, but not quite soft yet. I usually leave mine to simmer for about 7 minutes.<br>  <br>  Or you can layer the stuffing on lasagna noodles for the same effect.|`|83bf204290aa65d6f0c40248138b8013aa	yes sure, it's all pasta. It'd look good too. <br>  Bon Apetit|`|hV43wyvJaa	sure, people make stuffed shells all the time. do exactly the same thing<br>  <br>  Question though: are you cooking the manicotti to al dente or even a little shy of al dente before you stuff them? That's what you are suppose to do.|`|AA10928232	Yes, you can.<br>  <br>  Or, don't cook the manicotti noodles first.  Just soften them in a pitcher of hot tap water.  They stay firm enough to hold together while you stuff.<br>  <br>  BTW, the easiest way to stuff is to use a decorating bag.  Put your cheese mix in there and jab into each end of the manicotti noodles.

Combine very lightly with a fork. Using your hands, lightly form the mixture into 2-inch meatballs. You will have 14 to 16 meatballs. <br>  Pour equal amounts of vegetable oil and olive oil into a large (12-inch) skillet to a depth of 1/4-inch. Heat the oil. Very carefully, in batches, place the meatballs in the oil and brown them well on all sides over medium-low heat, turning carefully with a spatula or a fork. This should take about 10 minutes for each batch. Don't crowd the meatballs. Remove the meatballs to a plate covered with paper towels. Discard the oil but don't clean the pan. <br>  For the sauce, heat the olive oil in the same pan. Add the onion and saute over medium heat until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add the wine and cook on high heat, scraping up all the brown bits in the pan, until almost all the liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, parsley, salt, and pepper. <br>  Return the meatballs to the sauce, cover, and simmer on the lowest heat for 25 to 30 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through. Serve hot on cooked spaghetti and pass the grated Parmesan. <br>  <br>  --“Barefoot Contessa Family Style” cookbook|`|l4tZTALfaa	I like these real well<br>  2 lb ground chuck<br>  1 lb mild sausage<br>  2 eggs<br>  2 lg onions diced fine<br>  2 cloves garlic <br>  1 cup rice washed and drained well<br>  1 tsp salt<br>  1tsp pepper<br>  mix well and make about 1 1/2 in meat balls<br>  1 lg can v 8 juice <br>  put into lg pot and start to simmer with 3 cups water<br>  then add the following<br>  celery diced into chunks about 3 stalks <br>  1 lg onion<br>  1 can stewed tomatoe chopped<br>  and the meat balls one at a time lightly stur and simmer on low untill the meat balls are done about 2 hrs keep an eye and add water as needed meatballs will stick best if you can use a non stick pot or crock pot this overnight|`|xywgBurHaa	Forget it !! <br>  <br>  Best to go to a supermarket,<br>  You don't dirty any pans that way.|`|OcIYgqtyaa	BEST EVER BAKED MEATBALLS  <br>  <br>  2 lbs. lean beef<br>  1 egg<br>  1/2 c. plain bread crumbs<br>  2 tbsp. onion<br>  2 tbsp. parsley<br>  1 tbsp. garlic salt<br>  1/2 tsp. pepper<br>  <br>  Heat oven to 400 degrees.

That makes no sense to me at all.  <br>  <br>  This usually happens because the temperature of the pan has dropped.

It's not difficult, as long as you take multivitamins and don't lose out on nutrients. There are alternatives to like every meat, so you can eat whatever your parents are eating, just the healthier, veggie version! And they don't really taste too different from real meat. |`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I became a vegetarian because I didn't like the taste of meat or fish - simple. Google vegetarian meals, it'll come up with loads of choices. Or go buy a book from the store. If you are truly dedicated to becoming a vegetarian, don't just go cold turkey. Slowly cut out the meat from your diet to allow yourself to get used to it. And if you really are concerned about the treatment of animals, why not buy organic/free range meat or whatever it's called? From what I know they're treated better. That way you could have it the best of two worlds. Either way, good luck.|`|e4b5vMGUaa	Becoming a vegetarian is a decision that may take more than a day. It's not easy to immediately quit meat. Although some people can and do. A very important thing to consider as well is WHERE your meat comes from and WHAT is inside it. Almost none of our meat comes from a friendly farm, it is mass produced in and treated with hormones and genetically modified. So really, a lot of meat isn't even GOOD for you!!! Personally I am not a vegetarian but I have a lot of respect for those who are. I do however eat meat as little as possible. Vegetarian options are very tasty and good for you. When I do buy any milk, poultry, eggs, meat or fish I look for organic, cage free and hormone free products, They cost a bit more- but our health and our environment deserve it. If you have the ability and drive to become vegetarian do it! But at the very least know exactly what you are eating.|`|32zBW5uCaa	There are some really tasty veggie substitutes for meat at every supermarket.  I have had dinner at a friend's house many times, she has served the substitutes and I find them to be comparable to meat.

It's not enough reason to change your diet completely. <br>  <br>  What you can do is boycott the food chains and companies who hurt and abuse animals such as KFC.<br>  <br>  But, if you really want to try, good luck. A good website is:<br>  www.vegcooking.com or www.veggie123.com for more information.|`|EiI2sFxJaa	All I see when I watch that video is dinner|`|AA11336573	Well i'm a vegetarian because of health reasons more then peta reasons- I think they've gotten a little kooky with the whole ben and jerry's deal... but vegetarianism is really a more healthy choice I think. And if I can help some animals from getting eaten while I'm at it then great. I've heard that being vegetarian can help the world hunger situation, but that mostly has to do with the high consumption lifestyle the average american lives. I reccomend you google vegetarian health benefits and see what comes up. There are a lot of good things about it. It can even help with pollution because the demand to raise livestock simply for the purpose of killing is much less. Pity for animals is not a bad thing, people can get really mean towards folks who are just sympathetic. If you feel bad about eating animals, then don't do it. If you believe Genesis like I do, then it just makes more sense not to eat the animals God put on the earth to keep Adam company. He told Noah they could eat them because there were no plants left after the flood. |`|AA11612723	I have been a vegetarian for about seven months now.  I just went cold turkey (cold tofurkey of coarse).  At first I tried being very careful in trying to make sure I was getting all of the nutrients I need in a day, and lately I just figure I am doing alright with my diet from experience.  I eat basically the same foods as before, but without the meat.  Pastas, rice, breads etc.  <br>  I have always had a desire to be a vegetarian, though did not have the will power.  There are four major things that tipped the scales for me becoming vegetarian.  1.  I now work at the Division of Cardiology at a local university, many cardiologists are vegetarians, and believe this is a heart healthy diet.  2.  While working in Cardiology, we have vendors coming over regularly and providing free food (I know, controversial, but that is not the subject).  I figured great, free food, and ate very large servings of meat three times a week for a year.  Because of this I just got sick of meat and did not even want to look at it.  3.  Because I ate so much meat (and other factors) my blood tests and blood pressures all came became undesirable numbers.  4.  I now have a dog and a cat (never had any before) and realize that the only difference between what animals are okay to eat and what are not, is where you live.  In many countries my dog would be considered dinner.|`|IAa8IuZXaa	I feel your pain.

Then kill the flame.<br>  When the pressure comes down (stem escapes), it should be through. <br>  Throw in your parsley or silantro, your veggies if you wanted them rawer, and the oil.<br>  That is called Kitri.<br>  The former is called rice and dahl (beans).|`|nn8AdxnZaa	it really not as hard  as most ppl think, well at least for me it wanst.<br>  i think wat makes it easier is that im a vegetarian because of my discuss with animal cruelty. <br>  and as for food u dont just have to eat salad and veggies.<br>  i get food from giant eagle. they have stuff like meatless chicken nuggets, hot dogs, burgers, chicken patties and a whole bunch of other cool stuff that is meatless but tastes delicious. <br>  some good brands are morning star and boca<br>  hope i helped|`|RCXAsevraa	i'm a vegetarian and i found it hard the first few weeks but you can cook spaghetti or lasagna and then just replace the meat with quorn, as it is a meat substitute, and really you can not taste the difference and because quorn doesn't have the fat which meat does you don't put any weight on when eating it. I'm sure you can find plenty of vegetarian recipes on the internet!|`|JFGflKP4aa	I just became a vegetarian about 8 months ago. I do love it but it is difficult for a while. If you are really interested you just have to be committed. There are a bunch of websites to get you started: <a href="http://www.vrg.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrg.org/</a> or goveg.com. They both give you recipes to get started and help you know what items to avoid. Just make sure you get enough protein in your diet to   stay healthy because that's what keeps your immune system going. Soy or Whey protein powder is good with some soy milk (just a suggestion). Its something good to try because I personally feel alot healthier, and lost some weight from it. Its alot of work, but believe me it feels great. |`|gmeAkEk5aa	I read the book "Skinny *****" which helped get me started, and I ordered a free vegetarian starter pack from peta. These resources helped me find online communities that share experiences and recipes.<br>  Some people would recommend converting in stages, cutting out red meat, then pork and poultry then fish, but after learning the awful truths of meat I made the entire switch to vegan-ism quicker that overnight!|`|rWeLXPDiaa	it is not easy but if u r determand i am sure u can do it!!!!!!|`|UYZ2oD3taa	Hey. Its good that you are considering it. You are doing yourself, the animals, and the environment a favor.<br>  <br>  I did it for a little over a year, now i eat white meat.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you start off slow, eliminate the red meat first, then gradually start eliminating the white meats.<br>  <br>  Make sure you eat plenty of beans, as they are rich in protein. |`|uZ5xTHFKaa	i am a vegetarian, when i first went vegetarian i slowly cut back on meat, then i ate none at all, and started eating alot of quorn stuff, i have been vegetarian for 8 months (i no it doesnt seem that long yet) but i would never go back to eating meat now.

hDF0uIQ4aa	Anything that eats plankton has iodine.  They absorb the iodine from the plankton they eat.  Crustaceans, like shrimp and lobster, eat plankton.  Mollusks, like squid and octopus (cephalopods), and like scallops and mussels (bivalves), do not contain any iodine because they do not eat plankton.<br>  <br>  Not all seafood allergies are caused by iodine.  My wife is allergic to shellfish, but not to iodine.  It's something else that makes her allergic.<br>  <br>  Some other answers refer to salt as the source of iodine.  Iodized salt is very common, but iodine is not found naturally in salt - it is added during production.  Non-iodized salt is available in any grocery store.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Your friend will soon develop goiters & thyroid problems if she doesn't get any iodine, are you sure that why she "can't enjoy shrimp"? Does she ever put salt on her food? It's chock full of iodine!<br>  <br>  I think she's confused...|`|YsQQ30YJaa	All shellfish do.|`|AA11453909	Most foods contain minute minerals such as iodine, magnesium, potassium. I just don't know why your friend is afraid of eating seafoods.<br>  <br>  But he/ she should be aware of mercury which is carcinogenic. I don't think he/ she should be afraid since food producers are cautious of mercury poisoning.<br>  <br>  This is a misconception that your friend is afraid of iodine and other minerals which is sufficient when it adds sustenance to our bodies.<br>  <br>  Your friend should not be alarmed by it.|`|XZpIxLWAaa	Yes, they do.  As for salt having iodine, kosher salt or sea salt does not but ordinary table salt often has iodine added to it.|`|jhCxUUxjaa	i think salt has iodine so if they add salt to those meals im guessing she cant enjoy  that either
doz7RIoeaa	You are not doing the testing yourself. You are also not supporting it even if you are in the same org because it is not you who requires the testing to be done. You do not buy the animals yourself using your own money but only order them as a part of your administrative duties.  Neither did you unnecessarily volunteer to work there but only  to earn a living to provide for your family  ( a very ethical thing to do by the way). You are not being paid to for the animal testing but for the administrative duties you perform. Seeing all of this, I don't see why you would consider your job unethical at all. <br>  <br>  <br>  The only thing I found curious is this: "...though prior to becoming vegetarian I would occasionally order pigs and mice for testing (others ordered dogs and newts, but fortunately I did not.." Seemed like that you consider some animals to be better (dogs and newts) than others (pigs and mice)and that the latter would be somewhat acceptable for testing while the former totally aren't. I know this is probably not the case but it did sound like that when I read you statement|`|FicyC2TXaa	It's a rare and very fortunate person who gets to work for a company or employer whose ethics completely coincide with their own.<br>  <br>  Keeping a roof over your head and putting food on the table comes first.<br>  <br>  Edit** I'm guessing that the people who've said they couldn't do it or that you should get another job are teenagers, am I right? And being more or less kept by parents, yes? Never had to hold down a job or take whatever job they could get or were trained for in order to pay for accommodation, food, clothing, heat etc?  Never known the fear and misery of unemployment? Just a guess, of course.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	Well why are you in that line of work? Yea you are not the one actually doing the testing but I'd still feel hurt being in the same building with it! <br>  If you can deal with it, then whatever. if its the only place you can work then I guess it will do.|`|5KQKGqObaa	Well all i can say is to try to get  job somewhere else if possible.|`|JINK3IHiaa	Are you doing the actual testing? From your question, I'd say no. So no you should have no qualms.|`|UUsTlBrqaa	Yes you can still work there as a vegetarian and animal rights supporter but it is now your moral obligation to try and change things.  Suggest to some of the higher-ups to research alternatives.  Alternatives to animal testing like computer models and cell cultures have been used since the 1980s and have been found to be more economical, less time consuming, and more accurate for comparing how a human would react to something.<br>  <br>  Also you could let people in the community know that there is testing going on and could direct them to the person they can write letters to to reduce or stop the testing.<br>  <br>  Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing: <a href="http://caat.jhsph.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://caat.jhsph.edu/</a><br>  Read "Animal Liberation" by Peter Singer
DT2mU1jOaa	Yes, of course sake can make a person intoxicated. It is a fermented rice grain-beer.  The amount varies from person to person and one situation to another.<br>  <br>  Not a wine and not a beer read below they are good articles. Actually, it is a special drink that is not wine nor beer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_wine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_wine</a><br>  <br>  Sake is the english term but it is not quite right. Nihonshu (日本酒, literally, "Japanese beverage"?) is used to distinguish it from other beverages. In English, the word "sake" always refers to Nihonshu.<br>  <br>  Sake/Nihonshu is NOT 32-40% alcohol but do not take my word for it read the articles from above.<br>  Centuries later, chewing was rendered unnecessary by the discovery of kōji-kin (麹菌 Aspergillus oryzae), a mold whose enzymes convert the starch in the rice to sugar, which is also used to make amazake, miso, and soy sauce. Rice inoculated with kōji-kin is called "kome-kōji" (米麹), or malt rice. A yeast mash, or shubo (酒母), is then added to convert the sugars to ethanol. This development can greatly increase sake's alcohol content (18%–25% by vol.); as starch is converted to sugar by kōji, sugars are converted to alcohol by yeast in one instantaneous process.|`|PhPOLgHGaa	well it a form of wine so ya, you can get a buzz and i am sure you could get drunk if you drank enuff...as far as to how many glasses..that solely depends on the person...some ppl get buzzed or drunk off one glass wine or drink or one bottle of beer others have to drink like a case..lol..<br>  <br>  body weight has little to do with it, but its all in the persons tolerance.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Be careful drinking that stuff, especially if served warm. You can catch quite a buzz from sake and it gave me one my worst hangovers in my life. <br>  <br>  If it starts to taste pretty good and you can drink it without grimacing - you're halfway there. |`|6iiRFN2Faa	Sake is between 32 and 40 proof, so yes. It's hard to say how many glasses, because it's usually served in tiny cups and refilled, but think half the total volume as it would take of your usual red or white wine.|`|S8PYZT8Vaa	Definitely!  The amount depends on the individual's personal alcohol tolerance.  For example, not long ago my mom and I went for sushi and she was giggling after the first small cup, while it took me a couple more before I felt a hard buzz.|`|IVy35SE2aa	Yes, it snuck up in me after just a couple hours of eating and drinking.<br>  I was having a good time and didn't register how many I was enjoying<br>  at least I can't remember much about it.|`|PPLxDKYwaa	Well, it depends on the person really. You can get really drunk off of it as it is easy to drink and it's content is stronger than beer.|`|1pkpLtD9aa	Yes, it is liquor.<br>  Each type will have an alcohol rating on the side, as do most liquors.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|OKKQy2GCaa	<br>   Hell Yeah! Maybe around two for some. Depending on where you get <br>  <br>   it, it is served very hot. 
VMtO0fLOaa	I think one or more ingredients where expired, may be the cream of tartar or maybe the baking soda.<br>  <br>  maggi|`|WVP1v18Raa	It could be that your cream of tarter is old. Or the oven is not at the right temperature. Get an oven thermometer & set your oven & check it & I would buy some new cream of tarter as well. I hope this helps. That is the same recipe I use. The butter flavor shortening just adds the butter flavoring, so I do not think that or the sifting were the problem. <br>  <br>  Also when you measure your flour, do not scoop the cup down into the flour. That packs it in the cup & you will wind up with too much flour & a tough product. Always stir your flour until it is very light & then lightly spoon it into your measuring cup gently.

54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	Mix the grapes about half and half with water and cook, stirring constantly,  until they are complete mush. Strain the mush through a colander or big sifter, mashing it through with a big spoon. The colander will catch the seeds and most of the goody will strain through. You'll get a lot better tasting and more colorful jelly if you leave the skin on, it'll all cook down. After you get it strained, re-cook it with the sure-jell or fruit pectin, whatever you are using. Bring it to a full rolling boil for about 20 minutes, then add the sugar. Cook another 15 minutes and it's ready for the jars.<br>  <br>  Jelly is very tricky, be sure and cook it the recommended amount of time and use the proper amounts of your ingredients.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't jell freeze it and it makes really good grape juice concentrate.|`|pNxuvKUOaa	You'll have to cook the grapes then put them through a collander or a food mill to get the seeds and skins out.

OnY5tHZaaa	dude i asked the same question like 3 days ago and i completely agree I'm sick of stupid people saying how it is the worst thing n the world while clearly many legal substances are infact a lot worse for you.  I'd personally rather hang around people who are high on pot then drunk, i mean drunk people get violent, but people who are high on pot just sit on the couch and laugh for 10 hours, plus no matter how much pot you smoke you can never OD but we hear of college kids who die of alcohol poisoning all the time. and for all the people who say pot is bad give me examples, i know it kills brain cells but a lot less than a night of binge drinking. and they use it for medicinal purposes plus if they legalized pot the prisons would be less crowded and the government could tax it and maybe help improve the economy. Some say it's illeagal because alcohol is a white man's drug and white people in the 1930's and 1940's were racist so they banned marijuana, which was considered a "Mexican and black" drug. Marijuana is completely natural and totally American (George Washington used to be a hemp farmer). I think we should regulate it like alcohol and tobacco. You aren't allowed to make your own alcohol or tobacco without the proper license.|`|JINK3IHiaa	Cannabis is like tobacco, can cause metastatic lung cancer, foreign studies have shown. It's not well publicized due to it's illegality, therefore it cannot be legally studied, and those who get lung cancer form smoking it are generally older and don't want to admit they smoked marijuana. So They are equally dangerous, due to marijuana's lesser known effects.|`|wLKKGB3taa	Im against both. People like you who say its okay to do one thing because the other is worse are delusional. Their both bad. Deal.|`|1AdzD6bmaa	"Everyone" doesn't think that.  |`|IjYiTimiaa	Ok, first of all, just because something is a plant does not make it inherently good for people. Go roll around in poison ivy and tell me it's great for your skin because it's a plant. Smoke some and let me know how that goes.<br>  <br>  Alcohol is also a part of nature. Man cannot make alcohol, it can only be made by yeast. It does this by consuming sugars and converting them into CO2 and alcohol. Man does encourage this process and makes alcoholic products.<br>  <br>  All that said, people think marijuana is bad because of misinformation spread by the government. It was outlawed mainly for political reasons. You can look that up yourself. <br>  <br>  Basically, people are taught from a very young age that it is bad, and on top of that it is illegal. That is why most people think it is worse than alcohol. End of story.|`|87C0uAjYaa	Ignore the straight edge *****. Marijuana is FAR more dangerous for you than alcohol for the sole reason that if they catch you with possession they'll haul your *** off to jail. Other than that, yea, marijuana has NO negative effects, and alcohol can be chemically addictive and kill your liver. 'Nuff said.|`|hwWghZY8aa	i agree to a point...at least i don't remember ever hearing of a person being killed by a buzzed driver...man...i'm an old hippie btw...been there...done that...but i have been so high at times that i didn't know front from rear...maybe that's why i put my pants on backwards|`|AA12201234	Well since I LEGALLY can't get in trouble for drinking alcohol, I choose that over pot.

Cannabis on the other hand, if consumed through a vaporizer is practically harmless. it doesn't kill braincells. it just stimulates them. how many people die from cannabis? none that I have ever heard. dependance? slim to none, for me at least. should it be legalized? yes. and regulated just like alcohol is. its quite a shame imo. I can go on and on, but I dont want to waste my high typing all night. peace!|`|tqiyiQquaa	retard!<br>  Both r bad so don't do it...<br>  man ur brain is messed upp!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11307468	You seem to forget that alcohol is a product of fermentation, a process that occurs in nature.

f2d9c213ef900a74f5759771f3fb61a7aa	I understand the point you are trying to make . The problem is you have a few facts wrong . Woman make eggs and they are released every month ( your period) if you have sex and an egg becomes fertile..a baby begins to grow .<br>  <br>  Chickens also have period except there eggs are quite large ( compared to them) .If they do not have sex with a rooster , then the egg is not fertilized but is laid by the hen and so No chicken is growing in the egg ..It is just a period , nothing more . Most hen houses Do  not keep Roosters at all and so no chickens have sex, no eggs are fertilized , no baby chicks growing inside the eggs.<br>  <br>  The reason I do not eat eggs is the conditions the poor female chickens endure , their horrid life of suffering and also All male Chicks from laying hens that are specifically fertilized and allowed to hatch will be killed immediately and quite commonly they are put on a conveyor belt alive and chopped up alive by a machine made to do that .Then they become fertilizer .The girl chicks grow up to go into the same fate as their mothers.  The whole process and lives of laying hens is very bad until they are used up and then killed to become cat and dog food.. Remember Birds feel pain and have emotions!<br>  <br>  Vegan Forever|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Eggs purchased at the grocery store do not have any baby chickens in them.   The ovum has not been fertilized by sperm from a male, as no roosters are around females at an egg laying facility.

While the morning cup of coffee or tea perks up your mood most people can't stop at that. Almost every office goer develops a craving for the next cup and subsequently, a heavy fatigue sets in by late afternoon. Even if endless cups revives you at this time of the day, a total collapse is inevitable by evening.<br>                  Irritability, fatigue and gloom along with an uncomfortable sensation are the  usual symptom. what is worse is that finally when you try to sleep away  your blues at night, you just can't. That's no the end. The next morning you get up tired, thirsting for a steaming  cuppa  to settle your mood.<br>                  Thus begins a coffeeholic's journey. At the end of which, apart from developing dark circles under the eyes, you also acquire acidity problems, irregular palpitations and more.

Usually the price you pay is about 3x what they are paying for the meat to account for overhead costs.

However, there are many other kinds of alcohol (such as methanol, rubbing alcohol or isopropanol, butanol, and many others) and each one has a different freezing point. Water freezes at 0 °C and the coldest most home model freezers will go down to -18 °C. That is why alcoholic beverages won't freeze in your home freezer. However, most alcoholic beverage are not pure ethanol, but instead a mixture of water and ethanol. The freezing point of the mixture depends on how much of each component is in it. For instance, something with only 1% ethanol will freeze just a little below 0 °C, whereas something with 95% ethanol will freeze pretty close to -114 °C. How much ethanol is in a particular alcoholic beverage is listed on the bottle, either as a percentage or as a "proof" which is just 2 times the percentage (100 proof = 50% ethanol).|`|B9C8pDLvaa	as you are aware vodka dosnt freeze. i have had unopened bottles of vodka in the freezer. no worries.<br>  <br>  *cheers*|`|xMJ2r7Vcaa	yes

When the sausages are cool enough to handle, cut them diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices and set aside.<br>  <br>  Bring a large pot two-thirds full of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water, add the pasta and return to a boil, stirring as needed. Cook according to the package instructions until the pasta is al dente (tender but firm to the bite). Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water, and return the pasta to the pot.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until nearly smoking. Add the garlic, rosemary and pepper flakes and sauté, stirring constantly, until the garlic is tender and translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the escarole and sauté, stirring often, until the leaves are tender and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sausages and the reserved cooking water and cook, stirring, until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.

Sprinkle the breasts evenly with the chopped or dried sage. Top each breast with a piece of prosciutto, then divide the cheese slices evenly among the breasts.

Transfer to a serving platter and tent with aluminum foil, being careful not to allow the foil to touch the cheese.<br>  <br>  Increase the heat to high.

You are eating a large amount of simple white carbs and in women, this can make you retain weight, especially around the midsection.  Oatmeal is a great breakfast food.  I make it with unsweetened Vanilla Soymilk to add good protein and flavor and sometimes throw in a handful of frozen blueberries.  <br>  <br>  Lunch could be a veggie burger on a whole grain bun with lots of veggies and non-fat condiments.  No cheese, mayo, 'special sauce', or anything creamy based.  I sometimes do 2 veggie dogs without a bun, or with one bun split for the two.  It's a good high protein way to have a filling meal.  Serve it with a side salad with low-fat dressing. <br>  <br>  For dinner, a nice mix of asian veggies with tofu or mock meat served over a brown rice or whole grain pasta would be excellent.  Just watch that you don't use too much oil in sauteeing and that the sauce you use isn't loaded with sugars.<br>  <br>  The kraft foods website has a good journal and I think that webmd might have one as well.

ozWi3TJlaa	Some hams come with mold on them intentionally and it has to be cut off prior to cooking.  As long as your ham doesn't smell bad (a very distinctive odor, you'll know if you smell it), then just cut off the mold and proceed with your recipe.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  When I mentioned intentionally moldy hams, I was telling you the truth.  Here is further information I cut and pasted for you...if you go to the website, you can get even more information about how to tell if your ham is edible:<br>  <br>  Country hams develop an unattractive layer of mold during the curing process. This is normal and an indication of proper aging, much like fine cheeses. The mold resulting from the aging must be removed before the meat is cooked.<br>  <br>  Country-cured hams are cured with a mixture of salt, sodium nitrate (saltpeter) or nitrite and sometimes sugar and other spices. The salt draws out the moisture, leaving an enviroment inhospitable to bacteria growth. The nitrate or nitrite not only protects against botulinum bacteria, but also gives the ham its deep rosy pink color. Sugar is a tenderizer, and additional spices give various corresponding flavors.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	NO, toxins are the chemical residue from the living organisms.<br>  Just trim away any mold, internally the ham should still be OK.|`|nOVSf06Raa	I agree with the above answer cut the moulded part off .|`|I7Ee17s0aa	Cut off the moldy pieces and taste the left over ham.  If it has an off flavor, or leaves an aftertaste, don't use it.  Also, you didn't mention how old the ham was that you want to use, or if its been properly refrigerated.  You might want to contact your local grocery's meat dept. to inquire about expiration dates.|`|fBW54cAraa	Molds that grow on food are usually water-soluble, which means that the toxins can make their way into the ham and end up in parts that look fine.  Those toxins are not living organisms and some cannot be deactivated by high heat.  Don't risk it, throw the ham away.

xrRZeROmaa	Prep Time: 25 minutes<br>  Cook Time: 02 minutes<br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>   You don't need an occasion, just the desire.<br>  <br>     * 4 twinkies<br>      * 1 cup flour<br>      * 1 tablespoon malt vinegar<br>      * 1 teaspoon salt<br>      * 1-1/2 cup water<br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  Chill Twinkies. Completely combine other ingredients. Dip Twinkies in batter and fry in hot oil in deep fryer. (Oil should be at 350 degrees F.  To test, drop in a couple of drips of the batter.  If they pop right to the top, and start spinning and turn brown, you are ready to go.)  Only cook until golden brown about 1 or 1-1/2 minutes.|`|nOVSf06Raa	That sounds like a good idea , here is the recipe<br>  <br>  <a href="http://baking.about.com/od/fairandcarnival/r/friedtwinkies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://baking.about.com/od/fairandcarniv...</a>|`|DqEyrDYhaa	you need to make a batter for them...hold on I'll get you the recipe<br>  <br>  6 Twinkies <br>  Popsicle sticks <br>  4 cups vegetable oil <br>  Flour for dusting <br>  1 cup milk <br>  2 tablespoons vinegar <br>  1 Tablespoon oil <br>  1 cup flour <br>  1 teaspoon baking powder <br>  1/2 teaspoon salt <br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  1. Chill or freeze Twinkies for several hours or overnight.<br>  <br>  2. Heat 4 cups vegetable oil in deep fryer to about 375 degrees.<br>  <br>  3. Mix together milk, vinegar and oil.<br>  <br>  4. In another bowl, blend flour, baking powder and salt.<br>  <br>  5. Whisk wet ingredients into dry and continue mixing until smooth. Refrigerate while oil heats.<br>  <br>  6. Push stick into Twinkie lengthwise, leaving about 2 inches to use as a handle, dust with flour and dip into the batter. Rotate Twinkie until batter covers entire cake.<br>  <br>  7. Place carefully in hot oil. The Twinkie will float, so hold it under with a utensil to ensure even browning. It should turn golden in 3 to 4 minutes. Depending on the size of your deep fryer, you might be able to fry only one at a time, two at the most.<br>  <br>  8. Remove Twinkie to paper towel and let drain. Remove stick and allow Twinkie to sit for about 5 minutes before serving.|`|I7Ee17s0aa	I associate deep fried twinkies with State Fair food!  I have no idea how to make these indulgences, nor do I want to learn, but I suspect that a light batter is in order before frying.  I'm also thinking that a deep fryer is necessary in order to get them done on all sides quickly before they disintegrate.|`|8D2AyYOsaa	It would be great 4 slumber parties and for just relaxing and watching ur favorite movie or tv show. just get a deep fryer, or a big pot full of oil..then go 2 walmart ro ur local food store, and pick up twinkies. stick the twinkies in the fryer, and then ur all done. it taste  better with a deep fryer. and u should try it with ice cream|`|u4liwDhAaa	I to thought of fairs as an occasion for deep fried twinkies but a slumber party would be great too.

lpQZYEpgaa	Spicy Chocolate Cake<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  2 cups sifted cake flour<br>  2 tsp. baking powder<br>  1 tsp. ground cinnamon<br>  1/4 tsp. ground cloves<br>  1/4 tsp. freshly ground pepper<br>  1/4 tsp. salt<br>  2/3 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder<br>  16 Tbs. (2 sticks) unsalted butter<br>  1 3/4 cups granulated sugar<br>  2 eggs<br>  1 tsp. vanilla extract<br>  3/4 cup milk<br>  Confectioners' sugar for dusting<br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  Have all the ingredients at room temperature.<br>  <br>  Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 325°F. Grease and flour a standard 12-well muffin pan.<br>  <br>  Over a sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, salt and cocoa powder. Set aside.<br>  <br>  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy and smooth, 30 to 40 seconds. Gradually add the granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl, then fold in the vanilla.<br>  <br>  Reduce the speed to very low and add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the milk and beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just blended and no lumps of flour remain; stop the mixer occasionally and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Divide the batter among the wells of the prepared pan.<br>  <br>  Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto the rack to cool slightly. Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving. Serves 12. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Black and White Cookies<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  2 cups all-purpose flour<br>  1/2 cup sugar<br>  Pinch of salt<br>  16 Tbs. (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut<br>   into small pieces<br>  1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk<br>  1/2 tsp. vanilla extract<br>  3 Tbs. unsweetened Dutch process<br>   cocoa powder<br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add the butter pieces in 2 additions, pulsing after each addition, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and pulse until the dough holds together. Divide the dough in half. Transfer one-half to a lightly floured work surface and knead in the cocoa until incorporated.<br>  <br>  Lightly dust the work surface and a rolling pin with flour. Roll out each dough half into a 3-by-9-inch rectangle, 1D2 to 3D4 inch thick; trim the edges to even out. Place each rectangle on a large baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat the whole egg until blended. Set aside.<br>  <br>  Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Using a sharp knife, cut each rectangle into 4 strips about 3D4 inch wide (you should have 4 strips of each color). Arrange 2 chocolate strips and 2 plain strips in a checkerboard pattern, brushing the beaten egg between the strips and gently pressing them together. Repeat with the remaining dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and use a knife to square off the edges of each block. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Preheat an oven to 350°F. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets or line them with parchment paper.<br>  <br>  Remove the blocks from the refrigerator, unwrap and cut each crosswise into slices 1D4 inch thick. Place them 1 1D2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies feel firm when lightly pressed, about 15 minutes. Let the cookies sit on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. Makes about 5 dozen cookies.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Eat fresh fruit.

xrRZeROmaa	slice your breast meat thinly, about 3/4 inch.  Place the raw meat inside a plastic bag, and put it on a hard surface, like a cutting board.  With a meat hammer, or the edge of a plate, pound the chicken until it is about twice the size, and half the thickness.  Dip your chicken in seasoned flour, (salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder), dip it into buttermilk, and back into the flour.  Let it rest under  damp towel till the breading is sticky all over.  <br>  <br>  Pan fry the chicken in enough oil to cover it half way for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, and put it on toasted French roll with anything you wish.  I like mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado.  It's just as good plain  You can spray the chicken with a pan spray like Pam or Crisco, and bake it in the oven till golden at 350 F.  About 20 minutes, if you don't want to pan fry.|`|lpQZYEpgaa	Grilled Cuban Chicken Sandwich<br>      If you dont have ham, just leave it off the sandwich!<br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  For the marinade:<br>  <br>  2/3 cup mayonnaise<br>  1 Tbs.

Transfer half of the mayonnaise mixture to a shallow glass dish. Add the chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate the remaining mayonnaise mixture until ready to serve.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, build a charcoal fire in an outdoor grill with a cover and let burn until the coals are covered with white ash. Leave the coals heaped in the center of the grill; do not spread out. For a gas grill, preheat on high, then reduce the heat to medium.<br>  <br>  Lightly oil the grill rack. For a charcoal grill, place the chicken breasts directly over the coals. Grill, turning once, just until seared on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the perimeter of the grill rack, not directly over the coals. Cover the grill and cook until the chicken breasts feel firm when pressed in the centers, about 10 minutes. Cover each breast with a slice of ham and a slice of cheese and cook until the cheese melts, about 1 minute. For a gas grill, cover and cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, for about 15 minutes total, adding the ham and cheese during the last minute.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, spread the rolls with the reserved mayonnaise mixture. Fill the rolls with the chicken breasts and pickles. Press the sandwiches together firmly. Return to the grill and cook, turning once, until the rolls are lightly toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Cut the sandwiches in half and serve hot.
