MJEiCkt0aa	It is more than enough time!! I'm the same height as you and weighed 65 not so long ago. And in 3 months i had lost 7 kgs by just eating less and walking. Make sure you drink lots of water and NEVER skip breakfast! It's boosts your metabolism. If you don't eat breakfast your body will slow down and not burn as much calories as compared to when you eat breakfast.  Have cereal for breakfast with fibre, have a healthy lunch and a light super before 7. If you feel hungry in between snack on yogurt and a fruit. It's healthy, your metabolism won't slow down and you'll get proper nutrients. You seem disciplined and determined so you will definitely lose allot of weight. I know weigh 50kgs as a result of what i'm telling you. I started doing this a year ago and started seeing splendid results after just a month! And i didn't even exercise much at all, just walked allot.    Good luck and God bless|`|rl11rrqVaa	It is possible.  As u already have started to Control ur diet,  exercising will definiatly do the trick!|`|221NJw88aa	Do regular exercise.  Increase the amount of salad in the food and drink water before meal and avoid fatty good. Do not take junk food and include fruits in your diet. In this way you will get all necessary minerals and losses weight with out any health problem. Best of luck|`|O23lK3IUaa	Yeah it is poss. if u keep exercising that much & keep eating how u do but try eating heaps of salad i mean HEAPS .|`|s65op1hGaa	It's possible of course, but you're not going to lose weight if you are eating badly. So exercise & eat healthy you could be at your desired level in 3 months sure.   But don't stop eating, it really only makes it harder to lose weight.|`|zrUbBiFdaa	take your 2 meals and break the same amount of food into about 5 very small meals, if you only eat 1 or 2 meals a day your body goes into a sort of starvation mode and it holds onto all the calories and fat. do this and keep up the same amount of exercises routine and you'll definitely get rid of some weight fast. best of luck ^^|`|xItSR9Z7aa	You will reach your goal alot quicker if you combine exercise, with proper nutrition.  Also, you'll be able to maintain your desired weight for longer if you combine the two. Never, never, never skip breakfast!    http://flatabs2009.blogspot.com/    Good luck!
uFRIsdC7aa	Remedies  Folk  Acidophilus Take four acidophilus capsules three or four times a day with milk. The milk is an activating culture medium for the bacilli. This will soothe the sore and speed up healing. If you do this when you feel a burning or itching at the onset of the cold sore, this remedy may inhibit the formation of the lesion.     Aloe When the tingling starts, try rubbing juice from an aloe plant on the affected area. If you are traveling, take a bottle of aloe gel with you just in case a sore begins. This remedy is especially effective if used at the first sign of a cold sore, but will also stop it later on, too, and will begin the healing process immediately and keep the sore from "blossoming."   http://www.health911.com/remedies/rem_co...  READ MORE.|`|g4Cpi1fnaa	use Carmax!!|`|0fUzzF13aa	I would use abreva to heal the sore and try some concealer to cover it up a bit. Don't pile it on! Then use some foundation all over your face, but not a lot because you want a more natural look. There are green concealers that help neutralize and cover up red spots that you may have. Don't forget some lip liner and a nice lip gloss!

PrS7So5Yaa	According to "Eat This, Not That!" the best foods are:    1 cup low-fat yogurt or 2 tablespoons of mixed nuts  Red bell peppers  A cup of peppermint tea  A handful of sesame seeds.    Here are some other foods I found that help you get calm:    FIND CALM     Oatmeal:   Ah, the joys of carbs. In just 20 minutes (the time it takes to digest a bowl of oatmeal) they can have you grinning like you've popped a Valium. "When you eat a carbohydrate, your body sends an amino acid called tryptophan into the brain to trigger the manufacture of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel tranquil and better able to cope. Without carbs, your brain actually can't produce serotonin. That may be why dieters who swear off starches tend to get angry, tense, and depressed after just two weeks. But that's no license to OD on glazed doughnuts. You want carbs that are rich in fiber- like whole wheat pasta or beans- so that your body will absorb them slowly, keeping serotonin flowing steadily; otherwise, you'll digest them in a jify, causing a quick mood boost followed by another emotional low.     Pistachios:   A handful is all you need to tame stress. Pistachios contain fiber, antioxidants, and unsaturated fatty acids, all of which have been linked to lower blood pressure in studies. And just 1 1/2 ounces of these nuts blunted the effects of stress on people taking a math test in a Penn State University study. Participants still found the test to be stressful, but their blood pressure response was lower than when they took the same test while consuming a low-fat diet.     Milk:   There's a reason your grandma touted warm milk as a sleepy-time beverage. Whey, the protein in milk, has been shown to decrease anxiety and frustration. The calcium in dairy has also been shown to calm muscle and help keep blood pressure in check, though these effects can take up to a couple of weeks to kick in. In the meantime, start a ritual of heating up milk, adding cocoa powder and a bit of stevia, and sipping it before hitting the sheets. Ritual itself can be a stress-reducer. Plus, warm drinks are naturally soothing and digest faster than cold ones.     Avocado:   Not only is it thick, creamy texture inherently luxurious but avocado is also high in monounsaturated fat and potassium, both of which help lower blood pressure. Monounsaturated fat also helps keep receptors in the brain sensitive to mood-boosting serotonin. (Not to mention that getting too few calories from fat makes people very grouchy.) Half an avocado a day should do the trick; slice it and add to a green salad, or mash it up to make instant guacamole and eat it with baked corn tortillas.     Wine:   Go ahead and indulge in a drink (or two) with your dinner. In addition to offering disease-fighting antioxidants, a glass of wine acts as a central nervous system depressant; it initially relaxes us and lowers blood pressure. Just don't overindulge. Too much depressing of the central nervous system can leave you feeling well, depressed- not to mention hungover the next day.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	I am not sure that any foods will help but exercise will.|`|WMMG7Fhwaa	I would not use food to help stress. This is how obesity starts. Try healthier solutions. What reduces stress for me is exercise! Try it! :):):) Hope this helps
BLTq0vLWaa	Your already half way there mate, as you have already admitted you eat the wrong things, and even wish to stop smoking (Am i right?) which is very impressive ;) I'd suggest you visit you local NHS clinic to get help and advice on stopping smoking, best place to start.    As for diet you should cut out the Junk food completely and only have a small intake of fats each week. You should mainly Stick to carbohydrates such as wholemeal and rice etc, and proteins such as chicken, Fish such as tuna, Steak and turkey.  The main bulk of your meal should be from vegetables anything from leeks to cherries and nuts.  Fruits such as oranges, banana's and apples are also strongly recommended and will even provide wth a source of energy.    As for exercise stick to Cardio exercises for the time being such as running, swimming and cycling even rowing. and try to do one of those latter for 10 minutes each day resting on one day, and increasing the intensity and duration each week.   Mix the cardio excersises with bodyweight excersizes such as lunges, squats and crunches  for a greater benifit, do this in intervals and it will be easier for example:    Mon - 10 min cycle - 10 lunges  Tues - 10 min swim - 10 squats    I strongly recommend you go down to your local Gym if not to sign up them just to talk to one of instructors about nutrition and exorcise routines. They will be glad to help.     Try and do this with some other friends or family, it will make it more enjoyable and easier for you all ;)    Good luck|`|mmMgfhf2aa	I don't think you can target specific areas with diet and excercise. You may have to save up for Lipo!|`|3y96DmJdaa	I have just joined slimming world, they are realli good, the amount of weight people are losin in there first week is scary, One girl lost 7 and 1/2 pounds in her first week. Plus you dnt have to starve you can eat loads. You should have a look|`|xItSR9Z7aa	I too tend to gather weight around my thighs and abdomen.  You admitted you eat the wrong things, well, start eating the right things.  Lots of fruit and veggies, brown rice, pasta and bread.  Lean meats like chicken and fish.  Cardio exercises like running and taebo and great for getting rid of lots of flab.  Also, lunges and squats are awesome.    http://flatabs2009.blogspot.com/    Good luck!|`|YJGEEJhWaa	do 500 situps a day, 250 in the morning and 250 at night, they'll get easier and easier to do the more you do them, cut everything you eat in half, replace fizzy/alcohal drinks with water and herbal tea ( i love peppermint) try do 30 mins of cardio a day as well. you dont have to cut out all your bad foods just dont eat as much and replace 1/2 with good food! the weight will fall off -good luck -x|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	Diet:  nuts  green, orange, yellow, red veg - especially peppers and bananas  fruit  lean meat - chops, steaks, skinless poultry, venison, rabbit, fish  oats  eggs  semi-skimmed milk  olive oil  wholegrain, shredded wheat, wholewheat pasta, wholemeal (all sugar free)    exercise:  cycling (running does nothing)  crunches  twists  lunges  squats    Really recommend the diet for a few weeks before getting into the exercise regime     For more info get:  Abs Diet by David Zincenko  or  http://www.truthaboutabs.com/ab/?hop=m23...

xvey8ixPaa	This is a realy good questions to ask an eye doctor who would be able to determine more information in an eye health exam. There is not enough info here to know if you have any refractive error, or just tired eyes.

TORBP6QIaa	I remember seeing a site ages ago that you could input your size and it made a little picture of you.  I am pretty sure it was a website with something to do about dieting.  Now that I think more about it...I reckon it was actually on a weight-loss forum.  It was while ago and I have no way of finding it again other than embarking on an internet search.

9ko5WUFkaa	I love it - I'd do it all day every day if I could.  Sadly, I live in a cool climate island and availability makes it difficult to always have some on hand.  I'd grow my own but I live in a rented flat.    It's no-where near as bad as some people will try to tell you - if they'd only do some research instead of blindly believing what they hear in the media.  Really, it's not even a drug, it's a herb.  If someone buys other plants for smoking, such as Damiana, Cat Nip, Passion Flower no-one says they are smoking a drug, they are smoking herbs, even though there are mild psychotropic effects.  A drug is those horrible chemical concoctions, often pushed by doctors.  Simple over-the-counter and off-the-shelf painkillers cause thousands of deaths every year (and kids can buy them easily) yet there has never been a single death from a marijuana overdose.  Makes you think, huh?  It should.  If you disagree with it, look it up and find out the truth.  Governments don't like it because they haven't worked out yet how to tax something that people can grow themselves.    Oh, and if any one ehre is gonna get on their high-horse and say how bad pot is, I ask you - Have you ever had a drink of alcohol?  Even the wine at church?  If you say yes, you are/have been a drug user, and a very dangerous one at that!|`|pP3131WYaa	eww ur going to b ugly|`|vTQMIxvnaa	r u sick??? actually i know the answer........|`|51mloGCSaa	weed for babys pill for big boys|`|aY6EjDwjaa	my mate dan got into weed, and the smoking it didnt do much but change his attitude, but WHATEVER YOU DO dont get into dealing, or you'll get stabbed and sent to jail     BAD TIMES     but yeah dont do drugs blah blah blah|`|wP480B6Waa	as beiing a parent of 4 kids I think its a terrible thing that was introduced to children even teens.

As long as it doesn't get it the way of other things that you do, such as meeting friends, or school / work, then do it a much as you like.  I assume that you are going through puberty, and this can happen.  If you really want to cut down, then try to do it gradually, just do it less for a few days, then if you cn manage that, reward yourself with a good session.  Then try to cut back more, again rewarding success.  Don't worry too much, and have fun.  Hope this helps|`|2HH1PSnVaa	What's mastributing?|`|k6CSa9caaa	chill out, theres no harm in it.

MeYILJeSaa	:( It just sounds like you have a really crappy period. Some people get really really bad cramps, others don't. If you are worried that it might be something else though, you should see a gynecologist.

In the meantime, make your man take care of you.|`|9OyIL8P9aa	Getting pains and cramps everywhere during a period is normal.

AA11620807	Sweetie, I'll answer after this initial "yes big bro" themed comment..... GET CHECKED NO MATTER WHAT! MY sister was 'low risk' but ended up having cervical cancer that spread.... She died an ugly death because she waited to see the gyn..          Doctors are rigorously trained to be detached to an extent that they don't 'identify' with the patient. Its for their own sanity, but ALSO for cases like yourself.  Your doc will be professional, but view the actual details in a strictly clinical sense.           He/she will see DOZENS of sexually active women every day. Also, a pap smear is so incredibly routine...... I suspect that when you've gotten it done, you're going to be chagrined at how nervouse you were.|`|efRDPZayaa	Actually I dont think the gyne doctor will think much at all. If he/she experience, he/she should be seeing it thousands times. To a gyne doctor, it will be just a cold/flu to a family doctor. So nothing to worry. I can reassure you.     I would suggest you get the HPV vaccine, it is very effective against high risk HPV which cause cervical cancer.    Hopefully that helps. Good luck.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Gynecologists most likely don't think anything because they see so many patients. Everyone is different down there. As far as the test itself, don't be afraid. It's not that bad and it doesn't take very long. It's over in a matter of a few minutes. Just breath slowly and relax. If you tense up, it might hurt a little but since you've had sex before you probably won't even feel much. Also, make sure you take a light pad to wear when you're done because you may have light spotting afterwards but it's not bad.|`|i4NkPeATaa	It comes down to professionalism here. You can not control the thoughts of the gynecologist. They see women from all ages and social backgrounds. Just imagine how many girls (under 18) they see each year that are starting to have sex, then they see those same girls later having unwanted babies, abortions or having 100% preventable diseases. Maybe they think "whore" but I'd guess they think "stupid" more often.     If they are Professional you will never know how they really feel.|`|Lo23vA2Oaa	Hahaha nooo   It is their JOB. Part of it is to not be judgmental. Trust me if a person is willing to stick their head between your legs and deal with your infections and etc.. they're not very judgmental.|`|Msgw6Z7xaa	Sweetie the doc sees about 20 or more patients a day and more than likely 9 outta those 20 ppl have something wrong with them. they became a doc to help ppl not to judge ppl. so im sure if you have something the first thought will be how to help you not what to lable you as. he/she deals with things like that everyday so im sure that he/she isnt gonna go takin time to judge ONE person outta millions. n dont just not get checked cause your scared you'll have something its best to get things taken care of before things get worse.
cnnu1IFtaa	You can self certify for the first 7 days that you are off sick - your employer should have a form for you to fill in, and I wouldn't have thought you would need any more than 7 days off with a simple chest infection.|`|vaacRAi0aa	Go to your GP. Just get one for 2 weeks or so until it clears up.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	You are not generally entitled to receive a sick note from the doctor until you have been off for over a week, as the first week is self-certificated.    Your circumstances sound a little different, although thinking about it, not really.    Your employer will already know the dangers of working with these people and the risks, you should phone in sick for the first 7 days, then if you are still ill get a doctors note.|`|H5RF5w4daa	go dr's and ask him for one but explain why|`|DLuDg2vyaa	my dad is in the same situation, he works in a care home, so it is also very important not to give the elderly people any germs.    Yeah you will get a sick note, if you go to your GP.    It entiles you to go on the 'sick', this means that you will still get paid, because you work in an enviroment like a hospital i guess.

If so, try creating a light background noise (white noise) that suppresses other noises - like a table fan. If it is the light, try getting a sleep mask.     Otherwise it could be stress, if you know something is bothering your or causing you to worry. If so, that is the problem to address, and resolving that will take care of your sleep issues.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Stress.|`|vpa5EFn7aa	unusual unconcious activity is very common    an example is that if you constantly wake up at 4 am it supposedly means your depressed.

xvey8ixPaa	there are many things it could be that are really simple, like an ocular migraine to more serious things like retinal detachments. Eye color can change in life at any time. It is more a heredity thing. But, it can also mean something is up. Do not jump to conclusions. Call the Ophthalmology office and see if there are any openings that are sooner and ask to be put on their cancellation list. Call another office to see if you can get in sooner than a month.

ufgv7oTjaa	As much as I wish I could say otherwise, glasses, contacts, or surgery are the only way to improve your eyesight.  I've been looking for other options for almost 20 years since I first had to get glasses and I have found things that improve the health of your eyes (which can help them from getting worse), but they can't make the actual visual acuity better. Most of them are natural herbs and vitamins that help maintain the health of the eye and I can mention a few if you'd like.  The main reason is because vision problems are a physical problem (the physical distance between the retina and lens), not a chemical problem that can be changed with drugs, herbs, or supplements :-(    I've heard of eye exercises that some people try, but based on a lot of research I've done on them, there is no basis to say that it will improve your eyesight at all long-term. All that's left after all that is surgery or glasses/contacts. Sorry.    Now, as far as KEEPING your eyes healthy, absolutely! There are a few herbs and a lot of nutrients that can help keep your eyes healthy. The most popular and beneficial ones would be Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Bilberry, Eyebright, and most antioxidants (Vitamins A, C, and E, Zinc, Selenium, "super-fruits", etc). I wear glasses to correct my vision, but I've been taking Lutein and/or Bilberry for the past few years after I found out about this and I've noticed that my eyes don't get as tired, my eyes adjust and focus easier in the morning, and my vision doesn't seem to have gotten any worse. I can also tell after a week or so when I haven't been taking anything. Good luck!|`|e71MWgJJaa	you can get contacts if you are willing to touch your eye. that helps me alot its like i have 20/20 vision now. if you wear them every day your eyes will slightly get better.

Primary symptoms come from the narrowing of vessels that supply the heart, causing angina, and the brain, causing deterioration of function.

It is now so widespread that Dr. Paul Dudley White, the noted heart specialist, recently described it as "a modern epidemic."As the disease progressessometimes over a long period of timethe vessels that carry the blood from the heart to the body's tissues become stiff, and their inner surfaces roughened and thick. These conditions lay the groundwork for the three most common causes of death and disablement in America: heart attack, heart failure, and stroke.

GAy86ppQaa	Hi,    Assuming an endoscopy, this is a small camera placed either down your throat or inserted via your anus - depending what part the doctor wish to examine.     The sedation can be an injection or tablet to put you either to sleep or to make you very drowsy so you cannot feel the effects of the examination.    The anal entry itself isn't pleasant (my mother had it done 3 times as she has ulcerated colitis) but it does help the doctors/surgeons see what is wrong.    On a lighter note, if they are going to give your friend a seduction (as opposed to sedation), be happy if the doctor is a George Cloonie lookalike (assuming she is female) or have him arrested if he isn't lol.    Hope this helps    Richard|`|S5H0NmEWaa	A seduction? That would be nice. You might mean sedation - that's when they put you to sleep so they can take a look at your insides.    Hospital visits are rarely pleasant, but they're also often very routine. Nothing to worry about. If you have any concerns contact your GP or another medical professional to ask what will happen to you. It's impossible to say exactly without knowing what you have been sent in for.|`|dyQNG6V8aa	Do you mean endoscopy?  And possibly sedation?|`|9e1405bf185a865f8b87ab7c9380d12caa	I assume as has been stated you mean endoscopy. This means she will get a camera put down her throat. You can have this done with or without sedation but I would recommend it.

evxuwNGTaa	it sounds like you are doing good things but working too much on muscle strengthening. focus on cardio more (situps are fine too) and try ot to eat high protien stuff. also sounds like toure not taking in enough calories to burn off fat, therefore making it hard to lose weight.     focus on CARDIO only for right now and eating foods with less fat grams, not calories. Then when you lose the weight you want, you can start toning and shaping your body by doing squats and push up and other muscle strengthening exercises.    hope this helps! and if you happen to not see any improvement, then consult a nutritionist. There may be a medical problem that you dont know about, preventing you from losing wieght.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You are lsoing slowly and gradually, which is the safest and healthiest way to do so and stays off. Don't worry about how fast you are losing it. And your metabolism changes as you get older, and having children also affects it. So consider your change in diet to be permanent in order to stay healthy. You don't need crisps, cakes etc. in your diet, they are empty calories ( a little chocolate never hurt anyone though). Consider lifting weights, this burns your metabolism at a higher rate and keeps it going longer, plus tones very quickly. Don't worry about the pounds on the scale but rather how you look and feel, you may find this works much better for you than what you are doing now. I'm talking about light weights and lots of reps.|`|h3rN7snkaa	Well you are getting older so your metabolism is slowing down.   Are you eating the right foods on your diet?   Make sure you eat breakfast, thats what get your metab. going in the morning.   Breakfast:   -Cereal and eggs  -Toast, eggs, yougurt  - Toast, lean sausage, bannana   Drink: Skim milk!!! (fat free) if you really don't like it, atleast 1% and a small cup of water.   (mix and match these, just make sure its balanced)    Lunch-  -Sandwhich with meat (turkey, lean chicken, roat beef) 1 slice of cheese, mustard, and veggies you like. NO mayo. Replace lettuce with spinach, you won't even notice.   -Baked chips (good snack if you need one) cheetos are good.   -FRUIT! Defiinitly eat a bannana, apple, or somthing else with your lunch.   -A sandwhich substitute would be a tuna salad without mayo! Just drain tuna, but don't mix it with mayo. Now take some spinach, lettice, tomatos, onions, carrots, pickles, and put the dry tuna in the salad and mix it around. Put a vinigrette dressing or somthing, but not a lot.   Eat fruit with this to.   Drink: Water!!! Try to down a full bottle at lunch.     Dinner: Soup and toast is great for dinner. Its a light meal. Maybe a smaller piece of chicken with some veggies and a little pototas would  be fine. Baked beans and rice are delicious, add some ketchup and tabasco sauce, its great!   Again drink water!    Small snacks through out the day: (try to eat one in between lunch and dinner)  -Jello w/ fruit in it  -Veggies and a small amount of dip  -Fruit or yougurt  -Whole wheat toast and 1/2 table spoon of Peanut Butter.     Also I don't think your exercise is one to lose weight, its more for building muscle. It would be better to do light exerise for 30 minutes everday then a lot of it 3 days a week. The cleaning is good though.   Try to do 10 sit ups, 10 crunchs, some stretching, and any other you find nessacry. Then jog (don't run, jogging builds lean muscle) for 15 minutes. Do this everyday. Take up a dance class to, they are lots of fun and great for a leaner body.   Good luck!|`|afVR8dVRaa	well un lucky for you, your metabolism doesn't seem to be very high so the only thing i can suggest is eating less..

0ogTVAHbaa	Desquamation - The shedding of the outer layers of the skin.    Here is the Physiology    New skin cells are created in the stratum germinativum, the deepest layer of the epidermis. From this layer, the cells begin their migration to the skin's surface. Once the cells reach the uppermost layer of the skin -- the stratum corneum -- they are essentially dead. These tightly packed cells of the stratum corneum continuously fall as newer cells push their way to the surface.    The entire process, from cell birth to sloughing away, takes approximately 28 days    My answer to your question is Stratus Corneum and/or Epidermis.

rKW6x4Yoaa	I've had acne since I was a teenager. I did take Accutane and it helped for a while, but the acne came back, though less severe. I'm 26 now. I recently changed my diet to cut out refined sugar and refined flour and started eating more raw veggies because I suspected blood sugar issues. Surprisingly, (because all the dermatologists I went to as a teenager said diet has no affect on acne) my skin cleared up very quickly. It's been 3 weeks since I changed my diet and I haven't had a single breakout. Google "sugar and acne" and you can find out a lot of the science behind it, which is what I did only after noticing the results. So if you have a family history of type 2 diabetes or reactive hypoglycemica, I would give a change in diet a try!|`|WkcPWmR9aa	try to read this post, I think it can help  http://www.promdinurses.com/2009/01/dise...|`|ChSrd2ftaa	Adult acne are stubborn. I'm afraid that accutane is the last resort for such condition. However, if you don't wish to go for that (even I'd do the same), you can continue with the things you have been doing all these years. It will gradually go as you turn older.  I used a topical lotion named Erytop which worked well for me but after continual usage of this for 5 years, it stopped working. My skin got used to this. Then I took glycolic peels which gave relief for 5 months and then I was back to the same condition. I am still trying things to keep acne at bay, don't think one can totally get rid of them.

Once you have a relationship with God you will discover the point of being alive.    How to start a relationship with God:    (Speak in your head, or out loud where you are):  Admit to Jesus that you have done wrong and that you want to change and do right.  Believe Jesus is God and receive Jesus as your savior.  Commit to and follow Jesus.    If you do not believe me, ask God to reveal Himself to you tonight in your dream and ask Him if He is Jesus; or ask God to speak to you and ask Him if He is Jesus. Wait and see or hear what He reveals to you.     Next, play Christian music (89.7 FM available on radio or online), talk to God (in your head or out loud), read the bible (bible.com free bible reading online) and attend a good church that believes that Jesus is God and follows what the bible says.

It has less to do with age than with your health and activities. Where you are now sexually active, this would be a great time to get into the routine of an annual visit. Your gyn can help you with selecting birth control and answering questions you may have. And if you end up with an urgent need to see a gyn, you'll already have an established relationship with a provider who knows your history.

I wish you the best of luck - that's a really tough situation.|`|v7UR00HLaa	Get even, sleep with your sister|`|QYXij5Wcaa	From my opinion:  Since it was a one-night stand, it wasn't with one whom he loves and since it was from a night out from his friends alcohol, drugs and peer pressure all played into his wrongdoing. If it is inevitable enough to say that you two have a strong relationship, then stay with your husband. However, make it evident that he must build your trust up. Some punishment and scorn from your side could be justified.    Though, if it is likely his behavior will continue, then a divorce perhaps is necessary. Your emotions are perfectly justified and a small amount of time away to get your thoughts out is completely fine. Don't play victim and leave your residence, rather give him the boot. When you are ready and he is crawling back in with roses and such, you may welcome him into the household.    Sex is not always a sign of bond, emotions and experience are the greater player in strengthening your bonds.|`|Hhwzp6Iwaa	What you are going through right now is not an easy thing.  You feel you have been deceived and taken advantage of and you have.  It's easy to tell you in your time of hatred, disgust and even revenge to divorce your husband and move on with your life.  It's easy to tell you that because this is what the world is showing us on a daily basis.  Hollywood is the PRIME example for this.  People like or say they love each other for a short time then they move on because they are not happy with their current situation because they are based off of pure emotions.  What your husband did was not right and by all means was degrading to you.  What you have to understand is that we are all human and we are going to make mistakes no matter.  Was your husband influenced?  Yes?  He needs to come to grips with himself and realize that he is not a little boy anymore and that he is not SINGLE anymore.  Men tend to want the best of both worlds and we can't do that.  We will say mean and evil things to women and do the most horrific things to them thinking that it's ok, because we are modeling ourselves after our own flesh and carnal being. My advice to you is to do what Jesus did and forgive him and this is why.  Our purpose in life is to live as righteous as we possibly can and walk in the footsteps of Jesus Christ.  We are suppose to forgive those who betray us.  Read Luke 6 in your bible for reference.  I know it's hard to forgive him because of what he did but we are human and we are going to make stupid stupid mistakes.  You will be a better person by doing this and in return your husband should change his ways.  We need stronger women in this world to help support us men.  I humble myself as much as possible because my wife has stood beside me for 10 years and now I am a TRUE MAN OF GOD and she will tell you my life has changed for the better.  I use to be a cheater and would say things about her weight and say other mean things but where did that get me? NOWHERE!!!  Your husband has to let his past go and realize that he can't do that anymore and if his friends are telling him to do it knowing that he is married then they TRULY are not his friends.  My whole point in all this is that if you really want this to work and for your husband to change you both need to go to the Lord with all your problems and concerns and begin to walk your lives with him.  He wants the both of to come to him so why not take a bad situation and turn it into good by going to God.  Don't let society and earthly things come in between what God has intended for you to have.  Don't let people's influences distract you and get you off course.  People may say you are dumb for taking him back and that he will do it again, but what do they know.  They have their own problems but have to talk about other people to keep their minds off of their own broken homes.  Listen I know you feel neglected and left alone, but I am here to tell you that you are not alone.  God is there for you and he is waiting for you to open your heart and let him in and take over your life.  Both of your lives will change.  God gave his only begotten son to us for whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.  If you truly want to be blessed and want your marriage to work and have peace and joy go to God.  You can have money, fame, and power but if you don't have God you don't have anything.  Tell your husband you want to talk to him and take it to the Lord.  He will heal your broken heart.  Drop to your knees and Pray.  Get some worship music and if you want to keep your mind off the situation for the time being begin to meditate on all the wonderful things GOD has done for you throughout the years.   No more crying.  This is a human thing that we do when we hurt.  It's time to stand up strong and make a better living for you and your husband.  Pray for him and ask God to make him a better person and husband and soon to be father for you. I am only here to help you.  I have been down that road of destruction but have seen the light at the end and it's REAL.  I don't know you but I know you will have LOVE, PEACE AND JOY again and NO money or NO ONE can take that away from you because it's a gift from GOD.  I could have told you to divorce him and leave him and take his money but would that have made you truly happy?  Dig deep into your heart and forgive this man and have the stick to it ness.  This will make you a much stronger person SERIOUSLY.  I want to see you get through this and make it work.  I look forward to hearing about your progress.  Remember ask GOD for forgiveness now for both of you and to turn your lives around and focus on him.  GOD BLESS.|`|teAtI3Itaa	Divorce  once a cheater/always|`|JLayHNZCaa	Decide if you can live with it?  Can you handle it?

He will always be a cheater, you may work things out but what is done is done.    Dont be confused he proberly really loves you this is the most important thing. If you cheated on him he would be calling for blood.    Can you forgive him and move on really question yourself. If not move on.|`|2HH1PSnVaa	Cry about it
tK1yoGTkaa	First off I am sorry for some of the immature answers you will get in this forum (it's peppered with teen boys).    Seriously though, you are angry and depressed for a reason.  What he did is totally unconscionable!  Follow your instincts and leave him! For any one (man or woman) to be unfaithful after just 5 months shows that he or she doesn't love the other.  No matter what he says he doesn't love you (there is no way!)    Believe me, I am a man.  I know about the biological urges we men have.  One thing I have found is that once a man truly loves his partner the bond he has with that woman and the ramifications of losing her take over and he can more easily resist those urges. I have been married for 10 years to my loving wife. I've been there!    Oh, he is going to say all kinds of things honey.  He has alterior motives (possible change in financial situation, lost friendship with you, change in social status among friends and colleaugues, shame with his family). And to keep you he's going to give you the whole crocodile-teary, flower-giving, bended-knee speech. Don't fall for it!    Guys like that whom are unfaithful after just 5 months WILL do it again!  There are many other decent men out there that are more deserving of your sweet love. You will feel depressed for a while, I know. But you should know this: YOU haven't failed. Go back to New York. At 25, you have plenty of time to find the right guy.|`|TsjqzanQaa	People are tempted and make mistakes.    If you really love him, then you will have to forgive him and learn to live with this.

Q3wDaHITaa	I am so sorry that this has happened to you. You deserve to be treated much better. If this man has already cheated 2 months into the marriage, chances are he will cheat again. You do not need to be treated like a doormat.    I would advise you to do the following:    1. Go to your GYN and get a full STD test. This man not only hurt you on an emotional level. He also showed a complete disregard for your health. You need to make sure everything is ok.    2. If you don't already have one, get your own checking account and put all of your money in it. This will be useful when you do the next thing I am telling you to do.    3. Go into New York (I'm assuming you mean the city) and start looking for your own place. With the way apartments are here, you can have a new place by Feb 1st (depending on how much money you have saved)    4. Once out of the house (or before if you prefer) contact a divorce lawyer and get rid of him.    I hope everything works out.|`|oJKa5B1jaa	you should watch THE WOMEN.  maybe you should clear your head alone for a weeked but dont lose hope yet. it doesnt have to be the end.    and whatever you do...DONT GO TO CHURCH.  no joke.|`|AA10313787	divorce court?|`|hpFsK6DXaa	Go to church.

Same thing happened to me, except I'm the husband and my ex-wife cheated on me.  I took some time and ultimately came to the conclusion that I would never be able to forgive her and forget what happened.  Also, I felt that I would not be happy inside if I just went on pretending it never happened.  5 years later, I'm re-married and happier than ever!    Remember, that this is a decision that only you can make.  Which is why the time apart would be helpful for you to really search your feelings without any pressure from him.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	was she hot? cause I mean, if she was really hot I'd consider that mitigating circumstances|`|rLsphyqhaa	Sounds as if he had a night of bad things and now he is between a rock and a hard place. He does not realize he had steak at home and went out and got some hamburger on the street. So You do need some time away from him to clear your head. The he needs to understand that he does not need to go out looking for some hamburger when he can have steak every night at home. Now that does not mean you crawl in between the sheet every night however it does mean that he has a great life with some one who loves him and was willing to do just about anything for him with I'm sure a few rules of engagement. He needs to be reminded of the vow es you both took. Better or worse sickness and health richer or poorer until death we part.|`|mXYxRsB5aa	It might be a good idea for you to get away for a while so you can think about what you want to do and if you want to forgive your husband. If it was just a one off and you really love him you might be able to get through this. But if you do decide to stay with him i would let him know that if he did anything again that would be it and the relationship would be over.   You deserve to be treated with love and respect and every relationship needs trust   Hope it all works out for you hun , good luck|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Be realistic. If he did it once 2 months into the marriage, he will do it again. He got caught once, but maybe he cheated countless times in the last 2 1/2 years. Whether to stick with him or dump him is up to you. But realistically, expect more of that stuff in the future as it is absolutely not the behavior of a faithful husband.|`|yUnQahGoaa	I think you should go back to NY alone. Take some time for yourself try to relax and then think it thru. And, I'm sorry but I don't care what "excuse" he wants to give you, nothing is acceptable. You just need to decide if you think he'll do it again, or not. Is he worth keeping in your life? I know it's rough, good luck tho I hope everything works out for you!!!

6pCQTT4saa	Very good, the diet looks fantastic.  The one thing I've found helps enormously is telling others in your family about your new diet and trying to get them to do the same thing.  That way you can all watch each other's backs, making sure you all stick to the diet.    For something like this, family is your greatest strength.  Also, having a friend who's frequently around can help you.  Just make sure someone is holding you accountable to your diet.    A checklist also helps.  Make a list of days and which ones you kept your diet and which ones you didn't.  Having something to check off just makes things easier.    Also, try exercising and watching less TV.  Watching TV is a huge killer as far as weight, because it makes you more sluggish and more susceptible to bad eating habits.    I think exercise for the sake of exercise is usually quite boring and hard to stick to, so find some sort of intense sport you enjoy and get good at it.  I do free running, you might try climbing trees or taking long hikes (uphill is great!).    Above all, just be confident and motivated, and don't let yourself slip off of your healthy lifestyle even once, because that's all it takes.|`|Mg9udqEGaa	Put a picture of a fat person on your refrigerator door!

Underactive thyroid leads to dry skin and hair, coarsening of features, slow pulse and general metabolism and often eventually weight gain. The patient classically feels cold and is cold intolerant.    Overactive thyroid results in the patient being hot and sweaty with a rapid pulse. They are fidgety and anxious and sometimes lose weight. They may also develop exopthalmus, protruding eyes.

Overactive thyroid tends to make people restless, fidgety and anxious, whilst underactive produces lethargy.

A sensible diet and exercise are the only safe ways to lose weight.  I'm guessing you are just to lazy to put in the work and want an easy way.  I sure hope no-one helps...    and no, the effects are not long term.  When you eat and purge, or don't eat at all, your body goes into a survival mode.  When you next eat/start eating again you body will hold on to extra fat and nutrients in preperation for the next starvation cycle.  You will put on weight very quickly and more than likely more than you lost.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	How about this - go vegan. Why? Cause while you are trying to find food you can eat, your food content will be cut down and the food you do buy, will only be healthy. Ever seen a fat vegan? NO. Cause it's a very healthy diet. No meat, no dairy, no eggs. No eating out, no fast food, only natural carbs.   If you go bulimic - you'll put all the weight back on when you start to eat again. So try making a long term change instead. Think about it.

Woman usually get their urinary tract infection after sex. Typical symptoms are burning sensation upon urination. Other symptoms includes frequency, urgency, etc.     Go to your doctor. He will probably give you some antibiotics, and analgesics. Ciprofloxacin for three days, and phenazopyridine for the pain will do it.     Next time, try drink more fluid to flush out the bacteria. Also go to the bathroom to void after sex does help to flush the bacteria out, and avoid spermatocide    Hopefully that helps. Good luck

It may not be anything to worry about, but there is a reason and you should be told what it is by a professional, not "one of those things".  My son's lips turn blue when he has a seizure, but I know that's because he doesn't breathe during a seizure, so lack of oxygen is why for him.

Please dont listen to all the reactionatlist that jumped to the worst possible conclusion...  There are many other causes other then oxygen issues or acute respiratory issues...  Without a full exam and blood work they really shouldn't be spouting such inflammatory diagnostics...|`|QGuxbItCaa	Don't worry. Obama has blue lips and look what that got him.|`|o9qWYVA9aa	That is a sign as you probably know by now of low oxygen concentration in the blood stream.  That is pretty serious.  I would seek a second opinion.  Do you remember if they took oxygen saturation by placing a device over the tip of his finger or on his ear?  That measures how much oxygen is in the blood.  95% or higher, you're good.  92%, we get worried and give a little breathing lesson.  Below 90% we start giving oxygen.  Next time you go, ask about this.  If his sats are good, you really do have nothing to worry about.|`|W1q9hV2Naa	I would have his circulation checked and also his ability to receive oxygen to the upper region of his torso.  Or maybe he has great circulation and is one of the lucky ones that have great blood flow to his lips.  If your worried go she a specialist, maybe consider an allergy doctor to see if maybe it's something in his diet.  Good Luck and always keep your child's best interest at heart, you sound like a great mom.|`|tACJnpI1aa	I would think that maybe it has something to do with your drinking water. Water that has a high concentration of Nitrates has been know to cause something called "blue baby disease" and maybe it is affecting your son differently/less agressively. If it is on and off and only his lips it is nothing to worry about. But you should get a nitrate testing kit to test your water.    I came up with a way to remove without electrolysis. You can message me if you like. It's kind of complicated but not that expensive. You'll just have to buy yourself a few items or a simple chemistry kit.|`|m4mZMIMjaa	Um..... That ain't no skin condition, honey...    Seriously though, blue lips is typically a sign of poor oxygen flow, however, as a child I was exceptionally tiny and thin; every time I went to the swimming pool my lips turned blue due to cold.      Basically, two things I would be monitoring are his body temperature, and, perhaps, what you're feeding him.  Maybe he has an allergy that contributes to decreased oxygen and air flow.  It's also possible he has issues with his circulatory system (seems most likely to me).    I'm guessing that you have taken him to docs other than pediatricians, though if you haven't I'm not educated enough to tell you whom to take him to.    The fact that he is 2 1/2 tells me that he is becoming vocal.  Have you noticed him complaining about feeling poorly when his lips are blue?  If he hasn't been, perhaps the docs are correct.  Maybe it really is no big deal (as it was with me and the cold).  Pay close attention to your son to gather more information.  Ask him how he feels.  Observe his energy level.  If he is having difficulty breathing or is not receiving adequate oxygen then he will likely behave as though he is sleepy.  If he is running around, however, then he is likely fine.      I have no instantaneous diagnosis, but with more information, if there is truly a problem, you can go to your doctor and tell him exactly what is wrong with your son.  I've noticed that sometimes, with doctors, it's important to sound exceptionally confident so they will take you seriously (as it is with school employees- which you will soon learn).    Use sites such as web MD and google symptoms.  You may come up with something that I haven't.    To sum up: if there are no other symptoms besides blue lips, I wouldn't panic. but if he's lethargic, sleepy, or has difficulty breathing, I would certainly continue my fight.    I hope I helped, and I wish the best for you and your son.    Heather

mXYxRsB5aa	Statistics show that having sex unprotected with an HIV positive once person leads to a 1/2000 chance of contraction. Cases are usually for those with repeated intercourse.|`|396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	A man is seven times more likely to pass it on to a woman than a woman to a man.  If the woman is on Anti-retrol viral meds and the man wears a condom the odds are almost nonexistent.      I have a full AIDS diagnosis and was living with a man who was negative.  We were intimate many times before I knew and he is still negative.  It is easier to pass it to a man if he has open soars in his genital area like herpes.  I have read that when you have an STD that you are five times more likely to catch it.  Im sorry I don't have a source to give you, I have learned all this from reading everything I can get my hands on about the disease.  The very best place to find the answers to your HIV questions if the CDC website.|`|s6stLtvLaa	Mine actually comes from personal experience.  My husband and I have been together for almost 5 years, 4 of those year we have had unprotected sex.  To this day his is still negative.  We now take precautions (like condoms) to make sure he stays negative.  If a woman is on viral medication that is effective in keeping her viral load under control and a condom is used then the odds are ALMOST 0.     As for sources, you can find it all over on the internet, or read an HIV/AIDS fact book. Someone mentioned the CDC website earlier and that is a great place to start your search.|`|AA11080047	i would say 100% certain of catching hiv even using protection i would leave well alone.|`|0PkFuZMwaa	chances are slim as long as he wears a condom maybe two  lol|`|AA10808686	Congrats!  You now have HIV.
YYFCPfaDaa	Yes. In fact HIV infection is already managed as a chronic disease in the developed world. Anti-retroviral medication, while expensive, can now delay the multiplication of the virus and keep the viral load down, consequently keeping CD4 counts high and maintaining efficient immune responses. Its not infallible, and people will still die from AIDS, but HIV is no longer a death sentence, and in fact a HIV positive person can hope for a life expectancy as good as someone without HIV. This is not the case in the Third World of course.  Another factor is anti-retroviral treatment given to newborns, which reduces the transmission rate from mother to child to near zero.    Aussie babe isn't entirely correct. HIV only rarely causes life threatening illness in and of itself (can cause diarrhoeal illness, encephalitis and meningitis), but aside from these rare cases does not kill. However overwhelming infections only occur when high viral loads kill off the CD4 White Blood Cell populations and lower the immune system. Current anti-HIV meds prevent this from happening, theoretically indefinitely.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	you're right, that is a possiblity, and isnt it a horrible thought. did you know that in countries like africa, they believe they can cure aids by having sex with a virgin child. horrible isnt it. They are spreading it further through simple ignorance, not knowing how this disease works. I do hope for a cure soon.|`|Likst1Mxaa	In theory yes.    Biut in reality no. HIV leads to AIDS because the person catche sanother disease an their immune system cannot fight it... therefore it isn't the HIV that kills them, but the secondary infection which can lead to death/AIDS
Rk46lIBwaa	I am afraid this is basically just Tea Tree oil and its effects are marginal. Better to try Loceryl lacquer, it is expensive over the counter and therefore much cheaper to get a prescription from your GP. Even it must be used for at least 6 months to clear a toenail and often very much longer.

6ZmiuwWDaa	When you pump the iron your muscle fibres break, and will re-grow stronger due to the intensity of the exercise, thus eat protein as it helps to repair the damaged tissue, it is important to keep it up in order to adapt to it.  Being strong is being able to lift your own body weight and also lifting heavy weights, so when working out, do such exercises as Chin-Ups, whilst you progress as getting stronger, and heavier, try to have the ability of lifting your own self along the way, it is important.  Drink water, drink milk.  Do not snack at all.  Do cardio (Running, jogging, sprinting)  Sleep well (When your body says I am tired, do not ignore it to stay up and watch your favourite show, your body *needs* that rest.  Stretch, it is just as important.  Eat, when your body says eat; stop when your body says stop. (Do not stuff yourself or youll find yourself doing 5 miles)|`|sleETnrdaa	do weights, eat right|`|tY6nmpOAaa	do regular exercise and eat healthy food and most important thing is sleep well
p3NsXo0baa	Well i hopep its pregnancy for you but not for me as i only had a baby 6 months ago!! Im having the exact same thing. Although my vagina feels irritated and i had brown discharge. My period finished 5 days ago.  Im going to the doctors tomorrow incase its an infection. Mayeb you should do the same thing.  I dont think that would be a sign of pregnancy so soon.
AA10651540	Well I cant be sure if that is what you have but I think I might have it as well. I am in college and about halfway through the first semester I started having trouble falling asleep. First I could not get to bed until about one and I had to get up at 6am but then it started getting to the point where I could not get to bed until 2 am. I was fine during classes but when I would get to my apartment in between class I would just want to sleep so I would take a nap and so I thought my napping was why it was getting worse. So then I stopped napping but it still is getting worse. Now I am in the second semester and I cant get to bed until 3 or 4 (it is currently 4:40am) and on some days I dont go to bed at all now. I have scheduled most of my days so I don't have class until 1pm but two of the days I still have early class and it is so hard getting up for those. I thought maybe it was caused by the stress of school but I am junior so it is not like this is my first year. Well since it is going to be 5am so I guess I could try falling asleep lol. Good Luck!

Rk46lIBwaa	No one can tell whether your GPs diagnosis was correct, nor his prescribing appropriate.    If you are concerned why not have another chat with him?|`|Vhq3GURQaa	No one online can advise you. Please, do not let them. If the Doctor is someone that you trust and you have been honest with him then why would you not follow his advise? The people who love you want you to be healthy and happy. There is not the stigma associated with mental health issues like there once was. Primarily because so many suffer from depression. Again, do not be influenced by online non professionals. This is a decision for you and your doctor. For me, anti depressants were very good. Everyone is different. I think anyone who would tell someone online not to do something is showing their own ignorance. Why not consider a second PROFESSIONAL opinion? *edit* I notice that everyone who told you what to do has low rating at giving good answers. Again, I stress the importance of professional opinions. Not computer wannabes.|`|c2f7ef4507c724db34ebbcc925ef59e1aa	I think the way you feel is very common and I'll always say that doctors aren't always right- if you're sensible enough to look after yourself then you should know what's best for your own body. If you don't think you're depressed, then chances are you're not. However, antidepressants are often prescribed for more than depression, and you may find they help.    Everyone's experience of anti-D's is different and they may affect or help each person to varying degrees. I think that after a month you should know whether they're helping or not, and generally this appears in the form of you being able to cope with anxiety and melancholy better. It's not a quick or obvious fix. Equally, after the same amount of time you should know if they're having no effect at all, in which case you can stop.    I think your doctor is a bit hasty prescribing lexapro if you haven't tried counselling or even some alternative therapy like Rhodeola/St John's Wort or Yoga first. I'd go back and voice your concerns. Chances are it's a very low dose he/she's prescribed anyway and will just give you a gentle lift.    As for friends and family- IF you do decide to take the pills, your family should understand and support you. I don't understand why a stigma is still attached to antidepressants when so many people from all walks of life are taking them, and rarely with the side-effects people assume. Your friends don't have to know- unless you make it obvious when you take them nobody would ever guess you take them and it's also none of their business unless you want to tell them.      If you really believe the way you feel is temporary and external, I'd say follow your instincts, ride it out, and find some other way of dealing with it. If you don't think you can get through this without a nudge in the right direction, give lexapro a go and you're not bound to keep taking them.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	how deeply has your doctor looked into your symptoms?  Has he prescribed them after a lot of consideration or did he prescribe them to get you out of his office quickly?    I have never heard of Lexapro myself, but searches show that it is similar to an anti-depressant I was prescribed called Citalopram which helped me through post natal depression.    Personally, I think you should make an appointment to re-assess the situation with your doctor to figure out whether it is the best course of action for you or not.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	I'm very happy that you're hesitating before taking the antidepressants.  I think they are over-prescribed because it's easier for the doctor.  I call them "shut up pills".  The doctor gives them to you so you're artificially feeling better and you "shut up".  Many people take them even if they're not better just because the doctor said to.  You need to look at the real causes for you anxiousness and feeling down.  It could be a simple matter of changing your diet or doing something for someone else.    Before you take any kind of mood altering medication be absolutely sure there is nothing else going on with your body.  Have your vitamin levels checked (low levels of Vit D can made you feel depressed).  Have your TSH (thyroid) level checked, having hypothyroid can make you feel depressed.  Think about how you eat and how much exercise you get.  Do you get plenty of fresh air?  Do you volunteer to help others?  Nothing makes you feel better than to get outside of yourself and help someone else that may be less fortunate than you.    Take your health into your own hands, you'll feel much better for it.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Take them if doc prescribed them    I am on Lexapro|`|V4eh2yfcaa	Yeah if your feeling down your doctor had prescribed them.    But be careful you don't get dependant on them.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	You dont sound depressed so if it was me I would not take them.  Your a bit down and anxious and that is very common in this day and life.  Just try and buck yourself up a bit, be with upbeat, funny people, dump the depressive people for a bit and tr and keep yourself busy to take your mind off how your feeling.  Exercise might do it for you.  Good luck to you.|`|hpFsK6DXaa	I'm the kind of person that is against pills and medications. I was told to take pills for a reason that at the time was very serious. I threw very expensive pills down the toilet. Looking back today. I'm happy I did. Life goes on. Hopefully you can manage your problem without pills.|`|213Tajn3aa	yes drugs are fine|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	take them for a while they may help|`|R4WX5twzaa	So your doctor gave you pills for depression, and you're depressing yourself by wondering whether or not you should take them. How ironic.    I'm the kind of person who is very against anti-depressant pills. In my experience, they only make you worse, and I'm not going to go into detail because that wouldn't accomplish anything. The best and most natural form of anti-depressants is good ol' fashioned exercise. You wouldn't think that exercising would make any difference at all, but once you start going for walks or runs or lifting weights or whatever floats your boat, you will notice a world of a difference, I promise.|`|HLjQCwXXaa	lexapro made my cousin tired and dizzy, and it made my neighbor sleep all day. it can also cause weight gain. if you decide to take anything, you should take zoloft. i'm taking it now, and it works really well. it doesn't cause weight gain or make me tired or anything.     i don't think that taking antidepressants when you don't need them can hurt you. i think you should give it a try, and if it makes you feel better, then keep taking them.     good luck, and whatver you do, i hope you feel better soon! :]|`|NAIkcKssaa	Lexapro works wonders for the right person. Everyones body chemistry is different. If you are concerned about this you really should talk to your doctor. There are other ways to deal with anxiety and depression. Personally meds have worked for me but they are not for everyone really you should be asking yourself and doctor not us. This is personal and is something only you can know. we do not know your situation. Hope this helps. If you do decide to take lexapro know the side effects.
nRNsfbE9aa	In the manic stage it's easy to commit suicide. I was diagnosed with it myself around 2 years ago and know when I injur myself while going completely insane I can't feel it (like deep cuts from hitting things causing massive bleeding).

GXiCrhVYaa	The simplest answer is that a person is experiencing mania and major depression at the same time. For example, a person may be highly energetic and doesn't feel any need to sleep, as in mania, while having very bleak, even suicidal, thoughts, as in major depression.     What seems to be happening is that the person is undergoing rapid alternating moods, like sadness, euphoria, racing thoughts, along with dark, bleak thoughts and feelings.|`|ETcBRko3aa	It can be something like this:    being really tired (depressed) but having alot of racing thoughts (mania)  crying alot (depressed) and talking alot or ranting (mania)    See?|`|WkcPWmR9aa	try this http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/12/mood...  and other related topics
PGkR813Jaa	You are eating a lot of protein in your diet and not much carbs or iron.    Sensitivity to cold. Aching joint and absolute exhaustion and tiredness can be caused by anaemia. Or your body is trying so hard to maintain itself without the support of carbohydrates, the bodies preferred use of fuel.    Yes I do think you need to see your Doctor to arrange a blood test to check your iron levels and what not.    In the mean time try increasing the carbs in your diet.  And keep up with drinking your water.  The peeing is annoying but means that your kidneys are working well and filtering efficiently.
K60MPna1aa	I don't think in your case it increased your odds. N-9 is corrosive and can cause lesions on delicate tissue (vagina, anus) therefor making it easier for the virus to transmit to that person or from that person via the lesions.

0GIEZGY6aa	Oscillopsia is a visual disturbance in which the visual field appears to move, often caused by acquired (not being born with) involuntary rhythmic eye movements (nystagmus).  It can happen in children but is pretty rare in general.    You might ask your daughter's pediatrician what they recommend.  They may suggest seeing a neurologist, occupational therapist, or an ophthalmologist.

To reduce swelling and speed healing in the first 48 hours you should have been doing R.I.C.E.:    Rest: Don't walk on it if its really painful or makes you limp (use crutches if needed).  Ice: Ice the ankle 20 minutes every 2 hours for the first two days after injury.  Compression:  Keep the ankle wrapped up with an ace bandage or equivalent (firm, but not so tight you stop blood from getting to your toes).  Elevation: When you can, keep your foot elevated (above your heart is best).    If you have been doing this and the swelling is not going down, get to the doctor ASAP.    Either way you probably still should see a doctor, preferrably one at a sports clinic.  Even if its not broken, a doctor can forward you on to physical rehab (if you are active in sports, rehab will help you get back up to full strength faster and can help prevent future sprains).    Note: Never apply heat to this type of injury until the swelling has gone down.
ahjqc9Ifaa	Your sinus infection may be part of the good old common cold, William, with normal lung involvement. A phlegmy cough is not fluid in the lungs.    Nothing in your description makes it sound like anything more serious than a cold, quite probably the virus that started your sinus infection. You should continue the full course of amoxicillin and use the nasal spray as ordered. Check with your pharmacist about whether you can add a cough suppressant to the drugs you're taking; they'll know about possible interactions.    If you're done with your antibiotics, regular sinus care plus cough care is the way to go. As a chronic sinus sufferer, I've tried just about everything. Here's what works for me lately:    --Mucinex-D (Who decided personifying snot was a great ad campaign? Nevertheless, the stuff works)  --Hydration, drinking enough water or other liquids that your urine is almost colorless. This thins mucus in your sinuses enough that it can escape.  --Moist air. 1) Try a humidifier in whatever room you spend the most hours in (usually the bedroom). If the noise bothers you, run it for several hours before you sleep, then turn it off while you sleep. Be aware there are a lot of terrible cheap humidifiers on the market. I've returned two this year! 2) Go outside and get some very light exercise, like walking, for fifteen minutes. Yes, even if it's winter. Carry Kleenex; temperatures below the mid-fifties can cause sinuses to drain. 3) Get around steam when you can. Take an extra shower, or be the next one in the bathroom after somebody else's shower. Be the one who opens the dishwasher. Breathe deep over your tea or soup, or simply boil up a nice cup of hot water and breathe in; you don't have to drink it.  --Hot liquids. Yes, chicken soup, hot tea, and other mom-ish cures really do help break up congestion in both the head and the lungs.  --Spicy food. If it makes your mouth a little hot, it can also break congestion. Every Chinese restaurant has hot-and-sour soup!  --Neti pot. It seems freakish and like you might drown, but once you get the hang of flushing the sinuses on either side of your nose with warm saline every day (even when you feel fine), you'll find it really helps clear sinus infections and prevent future ones.  --Afrin nasal spray. This long-acting decongestant, which used to be available only by prescription, takes several minutes to kick in, but it lasts a good twelve hours. Often it's the only way to breathe through the nose while you sleep.

0MunIx8raa	My son was this way for a very long time until I aggravated the doctor enough to really get to the bottom of it.  He has very severe allergies.  We had to experiment with lots of different medications and testing.  When he couldn't breathe through his nose we finally found medications that work for him.  Try taking an otc allergy medication.  Claritin is a good one, or the generic version Loratidine.  This is what my son takes.  Zyrtec is good too.  Then get nasal spray.  Try otc saline solution first, if that doesn't cut it, then go to Dr. and get prescription for Nasonex.  Your sinuses are most likely swollen and irritated and that's why you can't breathe through nose and why there is a little blood.  This will take a few days to get in your system to make it better.  My son stopped the snoring and he can breathe through his nose now.  He's been on Nasonex and Claritin for about 5 years now.  Worked wonders.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	As a chronic sinus sufferer, I've tried just about everything. Here's what works for me lately:    --Mucinex-D (Who decided personifying snot was a great ad campaign? Nevertheless, the stuff works)  --Hydration, drinking enough water or other liquids that your urine is almost colorless. This thins mucus in your sinuses enough that it can escape.  --Moist air. 1) Try a humidifier in whatever room you spend the most hours in (usually the bedroom). If the noise bothers you, run it for several hours before you sleep, then turn it off while you sleep. Be aware there are a lot of terrible cheap humidifiers on the market. I've returned two this year! 2) Go outside and get some very light exercise, like walking, for fifteen minutes. Yes, even if it's winter. Carry Kleenex; temperatures below the mid-fifties can cause sinuses to drain. 3) Get around steam when you can. Take an extra shower, or be the next one in the bathroom after somebody else's shower. Be the one who opens the dishwasher. Breathe deep over your tea or soup, or simply boil up a nice cup of hot water and breathe in; you don't have to drink it.  --Hot liquids. Yes, chicken soup, hot tea, and other mom-ish cures really do help break up congestion.  --Spicy food. If it makes your mouth a little hot, it can also break congestion. Every Chinese restaurant has hot-and-sour soup!  --Neti pot. It seems freakish and like you might drown, but once you get the hang of flushing the sinuses on either side of your nose with warm saline every day (even when you feel fine), you'll find it really helps clear sinus infections and prevent future ones.  --Afrin nasal spray. This long-acting decongestant, which used to be available only by prescription, takes several minutes to kick in, but it lasts a good twelve hours. Often it's the only way to breathe through the nose while you sleep. Using it more than once a day for more than three or four days can cause it to become habit-forming (so you can't breathe without it), but reserved for the worst nights, it's a godsend.    Feel better soon!|`|hpFsK6DXaa	Hot chicken noodle soup. Rest.|`|HBK9aIhxaa	If your symtoms persist go to a doctor, you may have sinusitis

Its all part of the annoying survival instinct that is hard wired in your brain.|`|oJKa5B1jaa	maybe you are gaining muscle and losing fat  and less than 1000 a day with excercise is kinda pushing it    so dont listen to that other person|`|QKUfFdOUaa	try some selected yoga regularly to control weight|`|7PGWd3odaa	Your calorie intake also depends on your weight now and height. Yes, 1000 calories is pushing it. Are you trying to loose weight or just maintain? When I lost weight, I ate 1200 calories of healthy foods a day, spread out into 5 small meals. And I walked and did toning excersises alternating every other day. It could be muscle gain, and 1000 calories could be too little for your height and weight and your body could be holding on to the fat thinking its starving instead of getting rid of it.
wJdCXU27aa	that is my worst time too. I have found a few things that work- I always brush my teeth after dinner. The mint makes chips and chocolate taste like crap. If that doesnt' work have a tea- I know that sounds like "sure a cup of tea?!!?!?!"but I found getting up and making a cup of tea was kinda the same as getting up and getting something to eat. The more junk you eat the more you want.   I have lost a bunch of weight taking hoodia- it has suppressed my appetite and made me feel less hungry- It doesn't sound like you want to take supplements and that is probably the right decision for you. I have found that since I have hit 38 years old I needed as much help as I could get. I also take slimquick packets-they've helped also. I hand it to you- just keep trying, mix up your evenings a bit and get out of the habit of eating after 7pm/8pm.

Avoiding temptation and eating healthy is the number one strategy and will pay off well in the near future.    To test if you can really avoid temptation, even with all the food in the house, try the steps below:    1. Hide it - get it out of sight.    2. Wrap it in "plain brown paper" and stick it in the freezer.    3. Put it out of plain sight and practice sitting next to it without eating it. Do you think you can overcome the temptation ?

ufgv7oTjaa	First off, congratulations for WANTING to quit smoking!!    As far as answering, there are a lot of ways, and it also depends on how much you've been smoking. The best ways are slowly lowering your dose (takes a long time sometimes), or going cold turkey (which is faster, but harder). Either way, the last thing is making the decision to quit, so you'll eventually have to deal with the withdrawal.    For the most part, when you deal with withdrawal, you'll just have to tough it out, but there are some things that can help cleanse out the toxins and may help to minimize some of the effects of withdrawal...  Drinking water will help to detox, and taking some supplements that work as cleansers may help as well. Specifically, Apple Cider Vinegar, Green Tea (decaffeinated), Chlorophyll (fantastic cleanser), and even good amounts of fiber and water helps some people (although it's not very comfortable for the lower level of detoxification you get).    All that being said, it's likely that the symptoms should stop relatively shortly after your last smoke (it's never as long as it feels like it is). Your neurotransmitters don't take too terribly long to scream for something they are addicted to after you stop.  Another important thing to note is that no matter how bad it gets, taking more of the drug (and yes, nicotine is a drug) will only make the withdrawal last longer and will be harder on you in the long run. Good luck, and congrats again!|`|hoOU6HDbaa	A strong will power & "cold turkey".|`|e71MWgJJaa	people says it helps to chew gum and what about just stipping dont think about it think about how bad it is for you and that  you should never smoke again.|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	Masturbation. Every time you feel the urge to smoke, go masturbate. Most of the time, this will be a major inconvenience, but be persistent. You may find yourself at work, or amongst friends, or whatever, but make a point in secluding yourself to do it. Usually the urge will subside before you've managed to slip away, then you can skip it, and get back to what you were doing. If not, well then have fun! It's impossible to want a smoke while you're getting-off, and getting-off is more satisfying than nicotine anyhow.|`|XKTZbxBPaa	There's a special type of addicting gum to help stop smoking that you can find at your local pharmacy. It is very expensive, at least $40, but any type of chewing gum or bubble gum works.|`|hpFsK6DXaa	Will power. Listen to me.

AA12140689	Im 26 years old and have Aspergers syndrome. I havent had problems getting jobs. Its harder to stay at the job for long though. I usually end up either hating the job or how Im an outcast among the staff or how all the work is dumped on me while someone else tries to steal the credit for it or how my bosses ignore me when it comes to promotions. When I'm becoming miserable at a job I quit and if I notice that my employer is getting less satisfied with me I usually quit before they fire me. I usually change jobs every 1-2 years.    I dont tell employers (or potential employers) that I have Aspergers syndrome, because Im afraid that would scare them away from giving me a chance in the first place, because most people are ignorant about AS.|`|VjkDIvezaa	Don't tell the people you are working with. They will make it harder on you. I just tell the boss and he understands why i can't do some things like answer the phone (which i hate, idk if it is an aspie thing or i'm just weird but I hate the phone) But the other workers don't need to know as long as your boss knows.|`|AA11759000	ooo this winds me up, i have AS, i notice someone here says "mental disorder".    ITS NOT A MENTAL DISORDER....!!!    If most of the planet had AS then all you "NT" (normal) people would have the "Mental Disorder".... heres what i noticed...    I started to tell people i have AS, however it didnt work, the worse was those who "knew about it" where the worse as they knew nothing, just used the AS word a few times heard a few romours then become experts on facts they had nothing to do with it.    What i started to do was pointed out the FACT.  "if i come over as knowing alot its becouse i do, i have the ability of learning VERY fast and on my feet", this will explain WHY you are like you are rather than using the "AS" wording.  However learn that you dont always need to tell the "WHOLE" truth, hold facts back you think you need to, then once your employed you can tell them that....    However depends on your country, most wont like it as you know more than they do and wont employ you purley on that fact...|`|s5xOMGcbaa	It is hard to get on disability for a mental disorder. First you have to prove to a court that your disorder prevents you from A) Daily living skills, B)Social Functioning, C)Concentration, persistence or pace, D) episodes of deterioration or decompensation.  A doctor and friends who have witnessed and know the problems you have because of Aspergers would be very useful to prove you can't work.|`|1NA1KvA8aa	Go to http://www.spectrumites.com/ and check out the forums - perhaps you'll find some support there.     It is quite common for Aspergers to be misunderstood - it can truly be disabling in a lot of people (and if you take the new ADA definition of a disability into account, nearly anyone with AS is technically "disabled"). People don't understand that it's not like the stereotype; we're each individuals. Some aspect of the stereotype may fit us, others don't.  As far as whether you qualify for disability payments, it depends on your situation.  If you can't find work because of the condition, then your chances are much greater.  I have a job and go to school, thus I am ineligible, despite being considered disabled.     I'm lucky that I'm accepted by my coworkers, and one of them truly embraces my quirkiness. I have suspicions that my boss may even have HFA, as we're so similar it's scary lol. My mother, on the other hand, will have nothing to do with it, and refuses to believe my diagnosis.      It's hard, but I'm slowly learning that you can't control what other people think. All you can do is be yourself, however odd or awkward that person may be. If someone can't accept you for who you are, why would you want to associate with them, anyway? Granted, for jobs and such, this is definitely easier said than done.     All I can suggest is find some solid support, people who will actually support you emotionally, and not criticize you or try to "fix" you. Whether you find  it at Spectrumites or elsewhere, you really do need it.
NcNxIsynaa	I was at the GYN office with my husband after the exam he stood up and said Michelle you have cancer....I looked over at my husband and started to cry.....he just laid his head down on my shoulder...the doctor then went on to do a biopsy in the office....which hurt like hell..but my husband stood there the whole time holding my hand....after that I met with another doctor there in the same building to schedule a colonoscipy and the rest is history...I do remember the phone call I get at home from the doctor telling me the results of the biopsy....he told me the type of cancer I have and that I am stage 4 malignant....I started crying on the phone, thank him, hung up and just sat right down on my kitchen floor and cried like a baby,,,,but you know what Dave after that I changed my whole mind set....I am going to beat this beast..it is NOT going to beat me....|`|QkYzOuPdaa	Eleven years ago I was in hospital waiting for an angiogram when a young intern casually mentioned that my blood counts indicated that I had leukemia.I was unaware at that time of the many types of leukemia there are and assumed he had just given me a death sentence.I was devastated and so shocked that I asked no questions.After I had recovered  my main concern was how to tell my wife and children.Luckily I delayed (through fear) telling them and the following day had a chat with a consultant who told me that I had chronic lymphocetic leukemia and while there was no known cure it did respond to treatment and I could look forward to many more years with my family .I have just finished a five month course of chemotherapy and had a bone marrow scan which my consultant was extremely  happy with .He assured me that I would not need any further treatment for some considerable time.So I am quite happy but I have never forgiven that young intern for the callous manner in which he told me of my condition without also informing me of the treatment available|`|NvPD6VBoaa	I don't think I will ever forget.  It was this past October and I had a colonoscopy (age 46) for some bleeding I had just seen.  They were all shocked.  I was awake during the procedure and as they started the dr said "Oh, there it is cancer".  I found out that Friday and Wednesday they did surgery and removed 12 inches of my colon.  Thank god it was stage 1, and didn't travel and was not in the lymph nodes.  The hardest part was that same day the did a CT scan to see if it had spread.  Watching my two children ages 24 and 28  and my husband about ripped me up.  I think it was harder for them, than it was for me.  When you watch your loved ones hurting, it broke my heart.  When they came in with the results of the CT scan that it didn't spread....that's when I lost it.  I have a new outlook on life now....don't let the little things upset me...it has definitely changed the way I perceive life.|`|YVKcrcdZaa	I had a high PSA, which indicated that I may have Prostate cancer. They did a biopsy and told me it would take two weeks to find out the results. A week later I was seeing my primary care doctor, and she checked the computer for results of the biopsy. She started crying and informed me that I had prostate cancer. I was not afraid and spent some time consoling her. She then sent me to the Urology Clinic, where they told me I needed an operation to remove my prostate gland. My feeling was that I could beat this. I was never scared, I had a positive attitude. Afterward I had an orechietomy to remove my testicles. I have survived for five years now, and there is no sign of cancer in my body.|`|pEaR7iuxaa	Hi Dave  i hope you and your wife are ok   i have spoken to a lot of people about there feelings at this moment in there life and the same words come up fear, confusion, how can this be happening to me, denial, death, scared,   then you have people who say Straight away i am going to do all i can to beat this   as i have said before we are all indiviuasl and the way we are brought up through are lives will show when we are faced with cancer      i have answered quiet a lot of your questions and cant get my head around the way it has gone for you you live in the USA    and they still tell people over the phone you have cancer ( not acceptable )  the high pressure job your wife starts in the middle of treatment did no one tell you how much this was going to take out of her ( i no it is important for your wife to try and carry on as normal but starting a pressure job is that wise you should have been given more advice on how she was likely to feel )  going to a support group on a night like you did well that is just wrong for you and the others   how can they welcome a new member when mourning the loss of one   how can this be helpfull   from your questions you did not get any emotional support any where along this journy    no financial advise   no help on how do cope with the affects of the treatment     i no from experiance it is possable for peolpe to slip through the net and also get no support   and some people wont to deal with it on there own     I have a question for you " what has obama said he will do to help people with cancer "  cos from the way you have been left  to deal with this on your own there needs to be changes     i really feel for you and your wife as your journey did not need to be like it has   someone needs to take a look at what is going       now i no why you have asked so maney emotinal questions on here you dont have anyone elce     i am so sorry you and your wife have been treated like this   and my thoughts are with you and your wife at this difficult time|`|JZG7vpUlaa	I'm a bit odd I guess.  I've had 3 rounds of breast cancer and every time I knew before the doctors got the words out.  The first time we were on vacation and I noticed an indentation on my breast.  There are benign lumps, but not benign indentations so I stared into that mirror and said "Hanora, you are in deep sh*t".  I then proceeded to enjoy the rest of the trip and saw my doctor the day after I got home.    The other times I knew because of the reactions of technicians or the scheduling of further tests.  I felt a bit bad for the doctors actually.  They were clearly girding themselves for delivering bad news and the bad news was old news to me.  I have yet to cry about my cancers, just not my style.    I think that it might in some ways be harder for spouses, because they are relatively helpless.  The person with the diagnosis has decisions to make and is focused on getting ready to deal with this.|`|P544Sbmqaa	I had been having several health issues.  First was bleeding gums.  I went to the dentist and they told me I had gingivitus and needed a deep cleaning and gave me antibiotics (I really didnt have gingivitus, my platelets were too low, and thank goodness I couldnt afford the deep cleaning).  Then I had noticed that I had peticai (I cant spell that) on my leg, and I knew something was wrong, but I talked myself into thinking it was weird razor burn.  And then I had vaginal bleeding for 4 weeks straight.  I was miserable, and so exhausted that I literally could not stay awake at work.  Its a wonder I didnt get fired for sleeping on the clock, but it was a small, dead retail store, I guess no one noticed.    So anyways, I finally went to the doc about the bleeding, knowing something was wrong.  They gave me hormones to stop the bleeding and scheduled a pap.  I went back for the pap and the doc noticed some bad bruising on my legs, and she was concerned.  I think she thought I was being abused.  But, I have been anemic all my life and am fair complected.  I bruise easy, always have, and thought I just needed iron.  She insisted on doing blood work.  40 mins later she comes back telling me what stuff they can tell from blood counts.  The first thing she mentioned was aids.  I was 21 and had been a lil promiscuis, so as she is talking I am scared outta my mind that i had aids.  She finally told me that she thought I had leukemia.  I actually was relieved.  Luckily my aunt was with me.  The doc sent me to the er calling ahead.  I swear that is the fastest I have ever known anyone to get through to a doc in the er.      They officially confirmed diagnosis the next day and started treatment the day after that.  I was admitted for 31 days, and that was the first time I had ever been admitted in my life.  If fact, I didnt even realize I could travel with the IV.  I ended up urinating in the trash can that night because I couldnt figure out how to get the IV to the bathroom (it was plugged in, didnt realize I could unplug), and the nurses were busy.      Unfortunatly, that time was complicated further by a lot of family issues.  My cousin was my roommate and she totally spazzed on me and kicked me out of my own apt and my aunt had to get my stuff out for me.  It was a crazy mess, but keeping my mind on that crap kept it off the cancer, so it was good for something.    The second time I was diagnosed during a routine check.  I was p'ed off.  I delayed my treatment 2 weeks ama (they wanted to start asap) and was absolutly miserable that month I spent in the hospital.  I actually kept myself medicated quite a bit those first weeks of treatment.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Well Dave, me being the baby I am, I cried laying in the hospital bed when he said "a mass." Cancer never crossed my mind. Cancer is something I've NEVER had to deal with, ever. I had a customer that his wife was riddled with brain tumors, which I just heard she had cancer and was in a wheel chair and couldn't even feed herself. I cried every time the dr or nurses left my room. I have to say, though, they kept me pretty drugged up so I wouldn't have any more seizures. I found out 2 weeks later when they were removing my stitches. the dr came in and told me what my treatments were to be and then he left the room and sent in the nurse. After her going into more detail about my treatments and handing me all this paperwork and booklets and even a dvd to watch, I said to her, "I don't even know if it's cancerous or what." She said, "oh, it's cancer." I'm like Okay. She left the room and I cried some more. I cry at every mri. Just a little tear or two, cause it might show regrowth...but not yet. I'm such a baby.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	I had noticed a lump in late Spring of 07 and thought it was a cyst. By late fall there was another lump under my arm. The original was larger. I went to the gyn who, in response to my question about the lump, said "it has a bit of an irregular border." You never want to hear a doctor say "irregular border" to you ... it's almost never good. I suspected what it was ... but still believed the doc might be mistaken.    After the mammograms and ultrasound, the radiologist recommended a biopsy. She didn't let on to me that she thought it was cancer. However, she told the original doc (Dr. Irregular Border) who blurted out the radiologist's suspicions on the phone to me at work. It was like being gut-punched after the radiologist's nonchalant recommendation of a biopsy.    When the biopsy results came back, it merely confirmed what I already believed, that it was cancer. The only time I cried, and it was just a little bit, was when the PET scan showed no distant metastasis. I had spent the previous 2 weeks convinced that death was knocking on my door.|`|5657dabb07790f85827e1c0e8e02e5c0aa	My husband was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer.  I can remember so well the fact that, during the weeks leading up to the actual diagnosis, the FEAR of it being cancer was the worst part.  Once we knew for sure that it WAS cancer, it was ... like ... OK, now we know what the enemy is and there's no looking back so we're going to FIGHT IT.  That seemed to empower us.  We sought the most aggressive treatment possible -- combination of surgery and radiation.  It was "no holds barred" as far as we were concerned.  It's now been a little over one year and we're not naive ... we know that it may return ... but right now he's cancer-free.  So my advice is to cry a little bit and be angry for a little bit -- but then direct your focus and your efforts to doing everything that is available to you to fight it.  Technology is getting better each and every day.  (Prayer also helps a lot ... I've never been a religious person ... but I pray every day now.  I say to God that I know it's in His hands and that we have to accept what His choice is ... but to PLEASE PLEAS PLEASE hold us in His arms.  I also thank Him for every day we have.  I can't help but think it's working.)|`|lFqUMMAGaa	Hi Dave,  I am so sorry you and your wife have had such a bad time ~ I live on The Isle of Man and feel I had good treatment I was told at Nobles Hospital that I had cancer ~ But I feel I knew so it did not come as such a shock ~ Of course I was scared I had a Lumpectomy followed by another operation to make sure all the cancer was taken away, followed by 3 months of chemo one month of Radiotherapy (for which I had to go to the UK, it could not be done on The IOM) then 3 months of Chemo ~ During my treatment I had home Visits from the Practise Nurse and The Macmillan Nurse and free aromatherapy I was even given a wig in case I lost my hair, but I did not ~ Please feel free to e-mail me if you think I could help in any way ~   All the best to you both   Suzie|`|DIkfJ4DRaa	hey,man i am not cancer patient but my uncle does have long time ago  and i almost cried like that dude listen you should do happy stuff and do some chemotherapy ya know and do some operation if there was a chance|`|7823c88a25415e1b637f82bb9e175c56aa	I remember when the doctor told my family my mom had inoperable liver cancer.

Antibiotics destroy bad and good bacteria including in the vagina.  If you are seeing your doctor ask for duflican table and his recommendations for otc medicine like Monistat 7 which when used properly will help cure the yeast.  You can also eat plain, unsweetened yogurt to help put the good bacteria back in your system.

But when most people say they want to lose weight, what they really mean is they want to lose weight without altering their current lifestyle. They want to lose weight without changing the foods that they eat, or without getting up off the couch, turning off the television, and engaging in regular physical exercise. Not surprisingly, there is a huge market that offers shortcuts to weight loss through cosmetic surgery, diet pills, nutritional supplements, and various diets -- such as the Atkins Diet. <br>  There's a growing group of people who leap from one weight loss fad to another, in search of the one thing that's going to finally help them lose weight without having to alter the foods they eat. People don't want to give up their soft drinks; they don't want to give up pizza, and ice cream, and fast food. And they sure don't have time to go out and exercise on a regular basis. So the shortcuts market is absolutely astounding -- $9.4 billion was spent last year on cosmetic surgery alone, and hundreds of millions more were spent on weight loss pills, fat burning nutritional supplements, and low-carb foods. It's a tremendous market, and the public seems to be more than willing to keep spending money on these items, even though the real answers are to be found in something entirely different. <br>  The reality of weight loss is that there are no shortcuts! You can have cosmetic surgery to remove fat from your thighs, or the back of your arms, but if you continue eating the way you've been eating, your body will just deposit the fat somewhere else on your body -- usually in a place that looks even stranger than when it was on your hips. Even if the cosmetic surgery works out for you, it doesn't alter your blood chemistry, your cardiovascular health, or your level of physical fitness. Meaning that you are just as unhealthy after the surgery as you were before, even though you may physically show less body fat. Something similar is true with foods as well. Many people continue to eat a diet high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and obesity-promoting ingredients, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Then in an attempt to lose weight, they will take a couple of weight loss pills each day, and hope that those pills will some how counteract the entire day of eating unhealthy, obesity-promoting foods. It just doesn't work this way. <br>  If you really want to lose weight, you've got to do two things. First you have to avoid foods that promote obesity and weight-gain. These are the foods that are consumed by the vast majority of Americans, and are the ones that are the most popular in grocery stores and restaurants. Any food that's processed or manufactured is very likely to promote obesity, or some other chronic disease. Foods made with refined white flour or refined sugar, for example, will undoubtedly alter your blood sugar levels and tell your body to start storing fat. Foods high in saturated animal fats, such as red meat, or foods that are high in hydrogenated oils, like margarine or shortening, will also pack on the body fat, and harm your cardio-vascular health at the same time. Achieving a healthy body weight absolutely requires taking these foods out of your diet for the rest of your life. You can have either soft drinks and processed foods, or a healthy body weight -- but not both. In fact, much of the foods available today in the national food supply are simply incompatible with a healthy body weight, no matter how much surgery you undergo, and no matter how many weight loss supplements you attempt to take. <br>  The other part of the equation here is physical exercise. The human body simply won't shed excess body fat without engaging in regular physical exercise. Physical exercise gives you a much higher metabolism; it helps you burn calories, even while you're sitting or sleeping. It also increases your lean body mass -- especially when you engage in strength training -- and that results in even more calories being burned when you are at rest. Physical exercise, in fact, modifies your body chemistry in a way that helps your body better use refined foods such as breads or pasta. When you eat those foods without engaging in physical exercise, you're automatically going to add weight. But when you have an extremely fit body that engages in regular exercise, such as jogging, swimming, walking, or biking, you can get away with eating a few processed foods. But still you have to limit your intake of processed foods if you want to maintain a healthy body weight. <br>  In my own case, I engage in rather vigorous physical exercise several times per week, typically putting in 10 hours of exercise each week. And even then, I don't allow myself to eat any breads or pasta or refined carbohydrates of any kind. I don't consume breakfast cereals; I don't drink fruit-drinks or consume soft drinks. And what I've found is that if I eat a piece of bread or have a sandwich, then those refined carbohydrates alter my blood sugar in a way that makes me extremely hungry three or four hours later. If I had eaten a high protein meal, or a meal high in healthy fats and fibers, I wouldn't be hungry so quickly. So it is these processed foods that are in fact causing the obesity in the first place. And consuming diet pills or weight loss supplements simply isn't the answer to long-term weight loss. The answer is to look at your lifestyle, examine what you're doing wrong that needs to be corrected, and then have the courage to make the changes that will bring you into a healthy body weight and keep you there for life.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newstarget.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newstarget.com/</a>|`|7eeaf507e6f1e56cda89e4182a613257aa	This could also be a bonding moment between you and your son.  First, I would try going on walks with him, like through the mall, or just walking up and down the street.  Make sure he is eating healthy, not gorging over junk food or fast food.  Don't spring it all on him at once though, he might think something is up and then become a lil' angry or sad to the fact that that's the way you think of him.  Also, try getting him into a sport such as football or basketball.  Football more so :).  All in all, just start working and eating healthy with your son, and he should be losing weight in no time.

Your son is 12 so he dosent have to weight train, but he can do at least 10 push ups and sit ups every other day. Stay away from all fast foods, Mc Donalds, Wendys, burger King, etc.Buy some organic foods, even though they're more expensive, theyre better for u. Eat responsively, have chocolate and junk food once in a while, like once a week at most. Ride a bike, tredmill, try eating 3-5 large meals, instead of snacks in be tween. <br>  <br>  Chew gum, dont get scared take it eaisly and eat within range. At a meal, try not to have always greecie/greecy foods, like fries and meat. Have pasta one night, soup the other, but with healthy sides like potatoes(small servings) vegetables, have at least 4 oz of milk a day.If  milk upsets his stomach, buy lacktaid, which is actual milk with the lacktaite taken out, or organic milk, im lactose and tolerant(alittle bit, i ca tolerate some dairy, just not too much) i have organic milk every day and i am fine.  My cousin is 9 and is 106 pounds. Im helping him, and organic stuff, plus good sized portions are helping him to loose weight. remember, you can still eat junk, just not everyday, try to incorperate some healthy foods in his diet, portion control is key! <br>  <br>  I know its hard to say no to your son for food, but you dont have to say no, just limit what you have. Tell a doctor one day, just your average pediteritrician(however its spelled) and ask him or her to help you on some foods that taste good, and are good for you. Just follow what i said and he'll be fine.

There's a membrane called conjunctiva that extends from the sides of cornea to cover all the white of your eye ball (sclera) that is seen from the front and then turns around and covers the eye-lids and ends there.

vVTmJjJDaa	in the study that was done in 2006 (per the news articles listed below) indicating that black tea helps lower cortisol levels, the study was performed on "young, apparently healthy men" - therefore, it didn't include women, nor did it include those with stress/anxiety disorders...    however, "In the study, the participants did not know who was drinking real or fake tea. Researchers say that means any differences were due to the active ingredients in the tea and not to the relaxing ritual of drinking it or its taste."     as a female who suffers from a stress/anxiety disorder myself, which is made worse by consuming *any* amount of caffeine, it would seem that any benefits of lowered cortisol levels by drinking black tea would be hampered by the caffeine contained in the tea...    the study also states that "Ingredients such as catechins, polyphenols, flavonoids and amino acids have been found to have effects on neurotransmitters in the brain, but we cannot tell from this research which ones produced the differences."  that would lead one to believe that if *decaffeinated* black tea contains those same levels of catechins, polyphenols, flavonoids and amino acids, it would still cause the cortisol levels to be reduced, without the problems associated with caffeine...    that's almost enough to make me want to try it....unfortunately, however, to me, decaffeinated tea tastes horrid. :X|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	It really depends on your body.  Caffeine effects different people different ways.  You may have to cut back on the tea for a while and see how you feel.  I know for myself, if I drink too much coffee I get irritable and jittery.|`|KKIPlJAXaa	Black tea has caffeine in it, and caffeine will eventually make you jittery or uncomfortable. The amount of it varies person to person, but chances are if you're a major tea drinker your tolerance is high.     Tea can have relaxing properties, but they're mostly psychological. If you feel relaxed and can wind down while drinking a cup of tea, it's probably not the tea itself but the act of sitting and relaxing with a warm cup of something. You can argue tea is better than coffee since it has less caffeine so I it's better for de-stressing, but it's not going to help you lose stress-gained fat from your belly area or anything like that.

Question, so check that one.|`|dE0vtX2eaa	well if it was a sprain, i would say that your ankle would swell. however, dont put ice. try something warm. like a towel soaked in hot water and apply. if that doesnt work get some stuff to rub on it, like deep heat or whatever. but if the pain lasts for more than a month (or two), go see a phyiscian. once i took a football (soccer) boot to the shin and the pain didnt go for two months. but i waited it through and now im fine.|`|jCQXXPHWaa	no wrong do not put heat on a new injury, that will make it swell more.

hoDin3UYaa	It could possibly broken. I would suggest that you see an Orthopedic Doctor, who can give you an official diagnosis. Even if it isn't broken, he can still prescribe crutches and pain medication.|`|jCQXXPHWaa	You haven't given it enough time.  Where it hurts is important.  If its on the inside or outside of your ankle just under that bone, you could have sprained it.  The black and blue wont show up for a few days to a week depending on how bad it is. Ice is always the best medicine for a new injury but just doing it once is not enough.  Every hour ice it for 20 min. take ibuprofen (if you can), sleep with your feet up and an ace bandage around it.    If you've sprained it many times before it is possible it won't swell too much.  I sprained my ankle 15 years ago in a golf hole and never got it checked out now my ankle cracks whenever I walk fast.  I'll probably have arthritis in it when I get old.    Anyways, since I cant see your ankle my advice is, go see a dr. or school nurse or athletic trainer if you have one.  It doesn't mean you'll miss playing time that depends on how bad it is.  They might just give you an ankle brace to support it.    Good luck

I have struggled with these kinds of feelings for a few years myself, and I'm 26 now. the best advice I can give you is to go and see your GP. They might reccomend a psycologist or psycaiatrist, but If they immidiatly fob you off with medication and no follow up, then go see somebody else. There is help out there if you can find it. Keep looking.  Also, take up a hobby. Tafe, gardening, model aircraft, whatever you like. My biggest problem is I have nothing to do alot of the time. I'm bored and have difficulty taking action myself. if you can overcome that obstical you are halfway there.  Do keep going, you might feel lost, it sucks, but you only have this one life. There are good people out there.   Most importantly, don't listen to f---tards like CHENNIFER WINSLET. My god, what a moron. Capitals are for propper nouns and at the beginning of sentances.

When something bad happened to me,I couldn't cry I laughed.When something good happened I didn't react positive,I was negative.Did you know this is normal for people that has been through abnormal circumstances in life. I'm guessing you also had a colorful life.     You just have to tell yourself"I don't have to fight,there is no one whom is fighting with me"Or you could try telling your self"I am safe now,no one is going to hurt me"These things are very helpful.

There's no real need for them to discipline you, because you're only casual.  If they don't like you, then they just don't put any work your way again.

It shouldn't itch, burn or smell, and should be clear, slightly milky or off white at different times in your cycle before it dries on your underwear. It shouldn't be lumpy or really thin, though it does change in consistency throughout the month.

PGkR813Jaa	If someone is pronounced dead there is no coming back.    Your dead legally.    As for near death, then that's not for someone who has been pronounced dead. These people are at deaths door. Or 'dead'.    I have had a near death experience and mine is very much the same as others that I had read about.    Standing behind myself, watching them working on me.  Floating away, but so fast towards the brightest light I had ever seen. But it didn't even hurt my eyes.  I remember feeling utter, complete peace.  I was so happy and content.  Then the light started to get further away from me as I moved backwards back into my body with a jolt.  I was so upset that I had to leave that peaceful place to be back where I was.    But....    It deeply effected me and changed my whole entire life.  It had been a suicide attempt that had caused this near death experience.    I have never attempted suicide since.  That was 15 years ago.    I am so happy in my life.  I am a Nurse now. So I get to speak to others that have near death experiences.  Everyone tells the same story with just subtle differences.
dEQ42BzEaa	it could be just plain what we in VT call winter itch it gets so cold and your skin dries out so bad it feel like you have creepy-crawleys all over your body.  Get a really good moisturizer and use it every day and as far as your head do not blow dry your hair in the winter let it air dry and use a oil treatment 1 a week. I have found this works best for me.

Martin was raised in Garden Grove, California, and is of Irish, Scottish and English descent. One of Steve's earliest memories is of seeing his father, as an extra, serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place. During the war, in England, Glenn had appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey. Years later, he would write to Massey for help in Steve's fledgling career, but would receive no reply. Expressing his affection through gifts of cars, bikes etc., Glenn was not emotionally open to his son. He was proud of the boy but extremely critical, Steve later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his dad were mostly ones of hatred.    His first job was at Disneyland, selling guidebooks on weekends and fulltime during the summer school break. That lasted for three years (19551958). During his free time he haunted the Disneyland magic shop, Merlin's Magic Shop, where tricks were demonstrated to the potential customers. By 1960 he had mastered several of the tricks and illusions, and took a job there in August 1960.  There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, playing the banjo and creating balloon animals.    After high school graduation, Martin attended Santa Ana Junior College, taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre, a theater concession inside Knott's Berry Farm. Later, he met budding actress Stormie Sherk, and they developed comedy routines while becoming romantically involved. Stormie's influence caused Steve to apply to Long Beach State College for enrollment with a major in Philosophy. Stormie enrolled at UCLA, about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.    His philosophy classes intrigued him, and for a short while he considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian. His time at college changed his life: "It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy. Something about non sequiturs appealed to me. In philosophy, I started studying logic, and they were talking about cause and effect, and you start to realize, 'Hey, there is no cause and effect! There is no logic! There is no anything!' Then it gets real easy to write this stuff, because all you have to do is twist everything hardyou twist the punch line, you twist the non sequitur so hard away from the things that set it up, that it's easy . . . and it's thrilling." Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. "If you're studying geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life."       Martin in 1982.In 1967, Martin transferred to UCLA and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of The Dating Game. Martin soon began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices. At age twenty-one, he dropped out of college for good. In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer Mason Williams. Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an Emmy Award in 1969. He also wrote for John Denver (a neighbor of his in Aspen, Colorado, at one point), The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, and The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. He also appeared on these shows and several others, in various comedy skits. During these years his roommates included comedian Gary Mule Deer and singer/guitarist Michael Johnson.    Martin also performed his own material, sometimes as an opening act for groups such as The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and The Carpenters. He appeared at San Francisco's The Boarding House, among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on Van Dyke and Company in 1976.|`|9s4BVYv4aa	iv had that before hun! inv been on it for nearly two years n iv had bleeding .. if you are worried just double check with your doctor or nurse and see what they say :)

For your metabolism to work at all you need 900 calories in your diet. If you eat around that much and do some sort of physical activity then you can lose weight easier.

Take a deep breath of two, and say Thank You Lord, for granting me this new day in my life and for showing me the way to a healthier lifestyle!    You should have already switched to a low carbohydrate food plan and more exercise or movement during the day to try to stave off this diagnosis.    I like my green tea too and won't give it up. I make adjustments elsewhere! Like each slice or serving of bread or cereal is equal to one bottle of the sweetened green tea! Have a salad instead of the bowl of cereal.    If you do get this nastyish diagnosis, look on ebay for a book entitled "Type 2 Diabetes, The First Year" and/or one entitled "Atkins Diabetes Revolution" both books are excellent for answering your questions of what next!|`|bd104d85d1294e6f9362d5106c6dc583aa	Diabetes Mellitus has the usual symptoms of polyuria (passing large amounts of urine), polydypsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased appetite). So it could be diabetes if you have the above symptoms. But from what I see is that you are having green tea which is a diuretic (increases the amount of urine produced) plus you are drinking it with a lot of sugar. Now increased sugar in the blood can pass in urine and along with it take a lot of water and result in increased urine. So cutting on the amount of the sugar and caffeine you take, you can control your problem. So you not necessarily have diabetes it could be just increased caffeine and increased sugar intake.|`|400ebcb595e3169f1f5ef987c872bdb1aa	Go for exercises, otherwise your stress may lead to diabetes.Wear proper shoes and walk at least two Kilometers a day.|`|KWEg6RfKaa	Green tea contains some caffine and one of its side effects is that it causes is frequent urination.

The increased frequency is more noticeable in the night when one needs to wake up quite a few times during the night to urinate.  It is usually associated with other symptoms like increased thirst and increased hunger.  Since you have a doubt the best thing would be to get a blood test done to test sugar levels.  www.askmedicaldoctor.com
AA11567932	It might be that its not 'sound sleep' which is when your brain switches off and you sleep fully all night.

Or your physical status been compromised? Get a checkup with a physician and make sure your everything is working alright. If it is, then check you spiritual side. Nothing worse than to think there is no hope in life. If you're having difficulties seek out a person who will hear you out, everyone needs to vent, in some way. Over-sleeping is a sign of one or the other, and if u find you can't find anyone trustworthy enough to share your burdens then you may allow me to play that part. For I've been there too many times where I've needed a sounding board for myself and found none. Everyone needs someone to talk to. Find that someone and heal. So you may rest, peaceful.|`|sJQ6gG0Uaa	and me, try going to bed earlier or something|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	I would speak to your doctor about this... there can be many causes for feeling tired even when you're well rested.    Do you have a history of low iron count?    You could try to use a natural sleep aide like Melatonin (which you can get at nearly any chemist) for a couple of days and see if that helps.     Try starting a multivitamin. I would do it with the morning meal or lunch (not before bed as it may upset your stomach and that wouldn't help your sleep).    You could try starting a bedtime routine. Drink some chamomile tea (with honey, yum!) and do some light exercise about an hour before you would like to try for sleep (exercise helps you fall asleep, and improves quality of sleep). A short walk should do the trick.    Hope that helps!|`|IRUsj3h5aa	Its normal. everyone hates getting up.
6v0y9vLZaa	I understand how you are feeling. It keeps reality at bay when you load up on mind altering substances, Makes life seem easier to deal with at first. Eventually life catches up with you though and it can be a very scary thing. I suggest you seek counseling so that you can adjust to life without drugs and alcohol. It is too hard to do on your own. Good luck.|`|X9v50pmCaa	YOU NEED JESUS!  WITH JESUS THEIR IS HOPE AND ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE!    Start a relationship with God:    (Speak in your head, or out loud where you are):  Admit to Jesus that you have done wrong and that you want to change and do right.  Believe Jesus is God and receive Jesus as your savior.  Commit to and follow Jesus.    If you do not believe me, ask God to reveal Himself to you tonight in your dream and ask Him if He is Jesus; or ask God to speak to you and ask Him if He is Jesus. Wait and see or hear what He reveals to you.     Next, play Christian music (89.7 FM available on radio or online), talk to God (in your head or out loud), read the bible (bible.com free bible reading online) and attend a good church that believes that Jesus is God and follows what the bible says.    DO NOT WORRY!  TRUST IN GOD!  TAKE ALL YOUR BURDENS TO GOD, TELL HIM ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE BOTHERING YOU AND ASK HIM TO DELIVER YOUR SOUL!    ASK GOD TO DELIVER YOU FROM DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.  ASK GOD TO TAKE AWAY THE DESIRE AND TASTE FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.  ASK GOD TO DELIVER YOU FROM DEPRESSION. ASK GOD FOR SLEEP AND SWEET DREAMS.    GOD WILL HELP YOU!  TRUST GOD AND DO NOT GIVE UP!|`|V4E4t1QVaa	You did the right thing to seek help for your current situation- it shows that you care about life and really want to make things better. I believe it would be wise if you talked to a trusted adult, friend, or counsellor straight away. Though you may feel uncomfortable or feel scared about talking about your problems with them, trust me- it's worth it, they'll be glad that they can be of help to you, and later on you'll be glad that you reached out for a solution.    Don't worry.. things will get better because you have identified the problem and have been smart enough to ask for help. Lots of people sadly made the mistake of keeping their problems to themselves or continuing to turn to drug.. they eventually found themselves in an ugly situation and it was too late to turn back.

QYXij5Wcaa	Yes it will!  Let your body cheat a little, perhaps once a week, and eat a chocolate.  However, exercise that benefits all your muscle groups is the most efficient. By building muscle, you develop a greater metabolism and lose weight faster. I recommend a 45 minute workout session (with weights), 3x a week. This does not overdue it.  Also, cardio on the side will help, however, your body will soon crave its regular carb intakes and will tempt you to replenish that weight.    A better metabolism through vitamin and fiber intake as well as resistance exercise is the path to take.    Female body builders have such a masculine form because of excess weight usage (all day and everyday) and through the use of supplements such as steroids. Even celebrities have to do their dips, squats and sit-ups!|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	yes- ur body is made to exercise and receive the proper nutrients it needs.

I've lost both my parents and I know how painful it is.  Since you've been taking it for so long you might want to ask your doctor about stopping it.  Some antidepressants can cause withdrawal symptoms so you might have to gradually reduce the dose over a period of time.  Did you have a problem with recurrent depressions before your mom passed?  If not, then you could probably taper off the med and be OK.  People who have frequent recurring episodes of major depression often have to take medication for long periods.

ff25335b37cab0cc14d9566cedf7f5f1aa	A calorie is a unit of energy. When you hear something contains 100 calories, it's a way of describing how much energy your body could get from eating or drinking it.  If you eat more calories than your body needs, the leftover calories are converted to fat. Too much fat can lead to health problems.   But, if you are an average weight for your age and height, it is unlikely that your calorie intake is causing your cellulite.  Cellulite can be caused by a number of factors, for instance it can be hereditary, it can be due to hormonal changes and many other factors.

The unit was first defined by Professor Nicolas Clment in 1824 as a unit of heat. This definition entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867.[1] In most fields its use is archaic, having been replaced by the SI unit of energy, the joule. However, in many countries it remains in common use as a unit of food energy where it is generally taken to be 4.184 kJ.|`|wXKs94nDaa	Calorie is a unit of energy/heat. When you eat something you gain it and when you work out you lose it. 3500 calorie gain means 1 lbs weight gain and vice versa. If you gain weight the chances of cellulite increases.|`|8MuW1pfCaa	Hi, hon -- calories are what we call the measure of energy in food. Fats and sugars are high in calories.     Vegetables, whole grains and fruits are high in fiber -- lower in calories.    Cellulite isn't really caused by calories that you eat: http://www.cellulitetreatment.org/causes...    Of course, eating fewer calories will help you to lose weight overall, you might have to resort to more drastic measures to get rid of cellulite.    Good luck!

The first side effect I had was extreme fatigue but that only lasted the first couple of days. The only remaining sife effect I have are reoccurrant night sweats. Every night I wake up and I am drenched, I am only 24 so I know its not menopause, I have researched this quite a bit and it seems alot of people suffer from this but it is not listed as a side effect on the drug facts. Besides that no side effects and my panic attack disorder symptoms have been put on the back burner. Good Luck.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	I take Bupropion (generic Wellbutrin SR) (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) in the evening, for depression and anxiety.  I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.     The Bupropion seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.     The first couple weeks you take the Lexapro, you can have some "break-in" side effects, some people get them, and some don't.  They seem to vary from person to person, I had very bizarre and vivid dreams that went away.     I feel so much better on the meds - I wish I'd gone on them a lot sooner than I did!     Best of Luck to You :-)
BNAzjSO1aa	It sounds like it may be connected but  as it has been hurting for a while now I suggest that you see a doctor and get it sorted out. It is possibly nothing serious but on the other hand it might need medical care. All we can do on here is make guesses as to what is wrong with you and some people will be really badly misinformed, sp see a doctor who can examine the sore area and get a list of symptoms from you. Good luck|`|AVYaugeoaa	it could be brought on by back pain. too alleviate the pain in your back you should lie on a hard floor. and to alleviate a headache take your thumbs and lightly press next the the brigde of your nose for 15-30 seconds. or you can press in between your big toe and second toe for 30 seconds. it sounds a bit ridiculous, but it'll work|`|WxKUwcu5aa	back pain|`|EyL4pyB4aa	yya probably you should take somthin called voltarin its what my dad uses and hes like old and some times he an just bearly get out of bed but then he takes the voltarin and hes ack to normal but you need a proscription but its not very hardd to just explain to your dicter how much pain your in and that its almost unbarible   and say a friend mentioned voltarin and ask if that might be a gud idea then if he thinks sooooo he give ya da prescription then you can just go back and get repeats

Saturated fats are found in most animal products - such as meats, dairy, and poultry. However the body does still require other essential fatty acids - such as from fish, or flaxseed or hempseed oil.     Then try eliminating all dairy and other high fatty foods from  your diet. Lactose intolerant effects the body in a different way.         Here is the link to the acne diet.
QYXij5Wcaa	Salmon contains iodine, omega-12 and other such vitamins that increase metabolism. So fish regular in your diet will help you loose weight. However, it is sufficient enough to eat fish once every other day. Variety in your diet is the key to a better diet.    Don't forgot to further increase your metabolism through exercise and fiber intake (whole-grain).
UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.

They are both forms of cardiovascular exercises, not only do they get rid of fat, but also built stamina.  But have you heard or tried walking in the swimming pool?. Water is a great source for workout, you feel light while the water pressure puts force to your body parts. This not only gets rid of fat, but each step you take is harder and utilizes more body muscles. So if you are obese or do not want to workout on land or at the gym, then walking in the pool is the best exercise for you. Try standing in the shallow end, and walking towards the deep end. Make sure you now the depth of the deep end before you start walking.|`|AA10949589	This is the best for people who work a lot.  i have and love it  its also very easy to use.  just a little tricky to put together is all:    http://hubpages.com/hub/Ab_Lounge_Sport|`|7PGWd3odaa	I did leg lifts for toning my stomach. Do just what it sounds, lay on your back and lift your legs up to about a 45 degree angle, then lower them again, but DONT let them touch the ground, just lower them to about an inch off the ground then lift again. Dont push yourself, do as many as you can then take a minute or so break and do another set. It really helped tone me up. You might want to lay where you can hold on to something too for a while, they are pretty hard at first
H5NGXgqsaa	First of all, always remember it takes 'two' to participate in any relationship... Sometimes we tend to forget that & many become enablers or the holder of guilt or any other labels one may choose to use. You certainly know that 'physical abusive behavior' is unacceptable for anyone to be 'giving OR taking'. So obviously you should find some type of counsel if it be simply to help alleviate your sense of guilt for the behavior you expressed, even though such behavior was the worst that another brought out in you. Seeking counsel with assist you in determining whether you indeed are struggling with emotional issues etc...it can also enlighten you toward a positive thought concept resulting in positive & acceptable behavior. Realizing you should never use physical force nor should you accept to be mistreated physically is one thing but struggling emotionally & having the conscience continually haunt you is another. Life is too short to give in to unhappiness & lack of fulfillment. I wish you quick resolve & applaud you for seeking advice! Take care~|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	It would appear that this was a destructive relationship that is better off over ,for both of you. Perhaps some counselling for yourself would help you and during it you would discover if you do have real anger problems that could be treated or if this just a one off culmination of stress within the relationship.

Please stop being so hard on yourself there is not many people in this world that wouldn't eventually retaliate after experiencing ongoing violence. It sounds like he deliberately aggravated you to the point where you were bound to lash out (making you look like the bad one obviously). You are not to blame. Think about what your saying e.g. externalise it what would you say to another, if they told you the whole story.       I don't believe you need anger management, simply because you are regretting what you did. Most people that hurt others normally don't take responsibility for their behaviours.  If anything they blame others, e.g she/he made me do it. The violence is also normally over pathetic excuses like he/she should have cooked dinner on time, should have not gone out without my permission, shouldn't have worn that clothing,|`|X9v50pmCaa	THIS MAN THAT YOU WERE WITH WAS A VERY BAD MAN!

It was a self-fulfilling prophecy that came true because he wanted it to come true.    Be kind to yourself - forgive your mistake, or error - and do not spend time with this man. You behave in ways that you would not normally do.    And the only solution is either avoidance or - if you can face the test - re-exposure, but only if you can love yourself as you do this (it sounds like your love was for him and his child, and not for yourself - very dangerous).    Self-love is the most important love.    And just think what signals and life-lessons you are showing for this man's child. Treat a woman badly and she will return for more. And more. And more.    Is this a message you believe in and want to share with a child who (right now) is learning from the the only source he/she knows - the adults around them?    Forgive yourself, move one, and let the man solve his own personal problems without you - he is also very damaged, alas!|`|6v0y9vLZaa	I don't think you need anger management but you do need counseling. Everyone makes mistakes, you don't need to beat yourself up over one mistake. It sounds like you put up with a lot of abuse in the relationship and just snapped one day. A person can only take so much. Go get some help to deal with the break up and to deal with your feelings about yourself. Your self esteem has taken quite a blow.

BLTq0vLWaa	Do you have a clear goal of what you want to achieve in your mind? Because being clear in your own head of what you want actually makes getting it much easier.    And getting fit is a daunting task for everyone, you need to take it in small steps and set your self achievable goals not ones which seem impossible for example:    "I want to loose 20lbs" set it to "I want to be able to be able to go for a run for 5 minutes without stopping"  It seems a much more achieve-able goal.    Half the battle is being able to overcome the lack of motivation and if you manage to get through that then mate there are few other things you cant do ;)    Do exercise you enjoy, so the prospect of exercising doesn't feeling like a "Task" you can do this by exercising with friends or family or even make new friends at the Gym and out running.    Also reward yourself once you achieve an impressive goal with some new clothes,a night out, tickets to a football game, that way it gives you something to look forward to ^_^   You can vary your exercise routines to make it seem less boring, do some cardio one day then switch to weight-lifting, then body-weight exercises, not only does this seem less boring it gives you a chance to workout all the muscle groups giving you more visible results ;)    I hope you manage to motivate yourself mate ;) And good on you for giving it a go.

Then i started focusing on buffing alone, and by the end of grade 10 i had a good build but i started getting into fights because during all this i learned how to fight, my teacher have a negative impression of me because i fight, but i filled my resolve, my friend and I, although were not hoodlums run that school, no one in my school dare say anything insulting to me or even give me a dirty look, or anyone i hang out with. However all this attention from girls is dropping my grade, which i need to focus on more, but in 2 years i went from bottom to top from hard work alone, i had no talent in body building, and i still do it to look good.

Another is , you're comfortable with the way you are both physically, and mentally , so if you can get by without anyone pushing you ,,, Heck why not ... Maybe when you decide to get married ( if anyone wants the rolly-polelyin bed with them ) you can just allow the child to sit in the other room and starve and lay in it's own waste and  not do anything about it ,, because you need someone ELSE to get you up and motivated instead of being an adult and doing what you should ...

You need to report side effects to him so he knows, and he's not good to just stop them, you will cause even more of an unbalance.

The religion one sounds simply like a reason made up by parents over the years/centuries to stop their children from marrying outside their religion.    The idea that it's dangerous for 2 people of the same blood type to have children is quite widespread and completely mysterious. Blood type rarely causes any problems during pregnancy; the only case where it's sensible for your doctor to take precautions over is when the mother is a negative type and the father positive (and that's nothing to panic about). But in any case any problems which crop up are to do with _incompatibility_, and having the same blood type absolutely guarrantees that can't be a problem.|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	Religious affiliation has nothing to do with causing disability in offspring.

bd104d85d1294e6f9362d5106c6dc583aa	First the symptoms you describe are of hyperthyroidism and not hypothyroidism. Second the T3 T4 thyroid hormones are either raised or one is normal and other is raised but they are not low. Low thyroid hormone levels indicate hypothyroidism rather hyperthyroidism. Third the drugs you were prescribed are used for hyperthyroidism. So you are probably confusing the lab results and were actually diagnosed with hyper thyroidism rather than hypothyroidism. All this said, you should not start using medicine by yourself and first get yourself checked up and then start the prescribed medicine. Thyroid hormone drugs are nothing to play with. You need to check with the doctor again since you were off medicine for such a long time.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Thyroid meds are forever, you need to get that prescription refilled, go back to the doctor this could be life threatening.

cc7069b081574ad5a851bd0c3215de9eaa	Are you male or female?    The best thing you can do is eat a very healthy diet with lots of calcium and vitamin B and D.    It's uncommon to grow more after age 18, but it can happen. At my ten year high school reunion, one of the girls who was very petite in high school (maybe 5 feet tall, tops) was approximately 5' 5" (minus heels). We were all shocked.    I also hear that it's more common for males to continue growing after age 18.    Take heart, tho - short people live longer than tall people. Think about it - how many really tall elderly people do you see? I believe I heard short people live between 3 - 6 years longer than tall people. Everyone's heart is the same size, so the heart of a small person has to strain itself less than the heart of a tall person.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	I  hear you don't stop growing till you are 21 years old.

I tried to find out if there was a way to stretch yourself and become taller... yes there is! Many women in China were doing it so they could become flight attendants per the height requirements. Do you know what it entailed Broken bones, pins placed in the joint to pull them apart and stretch them for months at a time. OUCH!!    I decided that my 5'2" was better than being four foot something any day, if it meant that I had to spend tens of thousands of dollars and all of that pain to gain a few inches. I later found out I was 5'3"!! Whoo hoo, my day was made!    You may grow taller depending on your nutrient intakea and your diet.. NO carbonated drinks, they prevent the absorbtion of calcium.. but if all else fails, just wait and then get yourself some gorgeous heels and dress  in clothes that give the illusion of length.. same color tops and bottoms.|`|hh7gKHdWaa	Have you legs broken and braced like in the movie Gattaca.|`|6lmFyr2maa	no chance, if you had an xray you would clearly see that your growth plates are shut|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	It's all about genetics, my guy went from 5'6" to 5"8" between 18 and 21 but he had a bad burn and I think it took time for his body to recover from that so he grew in a time people usually don't but if you were very sick during  your teen years you still have a chance.

And yes, it is surgery so it is going to hurt big time.   You will have two back eyes for a week or so, there is a high chance of getting an infection. Honestly it is just not worth it .

6MRcqskIaa	If you are not sure speak to his treating doctor. Tell him of your concerns the doctor will tell you if he is deliberately using his mental health condition as an excuse. If he isn't then he needs to be hospitalised for yours and his safety.   Although I must admit, what I understand about mental illness (very little) no mental health condition causes outrages like your talking about, it sounds like he is making up excuses. Sounds like he is a control freak. A better word for this is domestic violence (look it up for better understanding) and maybe you should consider ending the relationship before you get hurt.   Another way to look at this, does he have control over these outrages Does he all the sudden become violent then apologetic for his violent behaviours. Is there something that is triggering it off. Something you supposedly did. Does he act like this too everyone or just you? If it is just you, then you need to ask yourself.  Why doesn't he act violently towards his boss, mother, father, or close friends, if it is the mental illness causing the problem.  Seriously mental health conditions do not just turn on and off like a tap. Medication and Psychotherapy is the only thing that can alter the mood and generally that is over a period of time (not instantly) like you are describing.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Ummm....you would have to know exactly what he is diagnosed with to understand the condition. There is no specific disorder for uncontrollable rage. Sorry.

x3EPqezJaa	It does not sound like bi-polar to me. People with bipolar disorder generally cycle from mania to depression over the course of weeks or months, not hours. Such dramatic changes in mood sound more like borderline personality disorder. I just wanted to clarify, since "BPD" stands for bipolar disorder and also borderline personality disorder and I wasn't sure which one you meant. As for the other disorders: all of your issues sound like borderline personality disorder to me. My mom has that so I'm rather familiar with it. The fact that your doctor said you didn't have the other disorders indicates to me that you likely don't.     Being borderline interferes with concentration because your emotions are so close to the surface and so dramatic. So I think in a certain sense, all borderlines have attention deficits. But I haven't heard of them eing treated for attention issues because as far as I know, ADD is considered more of a stand-alone diagnosis. If attention problems can be linked to another psychological disorder, then they treat that disorder, not ADD.    You'd know if you were autistic. Bare minimum, you'd not have spoken till age 4 or later, and had serious language deficits. So I'd say no, you're not autistic.    Asperger's is part of the autism spectrum, and some of its traits can be quite subtle. Some of the interpersonal connection issues can be a bit superficially similar to those with borderline. But I think you'd know if you had it.    A lot of people with OCD don't know they have it--they think that they're behaving normally. Like, a person with OCD who washes his hands all the time thinks he does it because he's dirty, whereas an outsider could easily see he's doing it due to an obsession. I would go along with your doctor's assessment in this area, he knows best.|`|d3b8d95f3c206880dff89e3a0ed42336aa	I have bipolar and what you describe is not bipolar as I know it, but I'm not a doctor. I think it sounds like you want more labels so that you can get more sympathy.  If you want a word of advice from someone whose life has been destroyed by psychiatric labels, I would consider carefully what you try to get yourself labelled with.  These labels stay with you forever and if you wish to achieve you goals, and I believe and hope very much that you will do, then the less labels you have the less of a struggle you will have to achieve them.  I can see that it important - very - to get the correct treatment and diagnoses but please don't start looking into more and more labels as I want to see you on that beach one day with a golden tan I would die for with a beauty on your arm that all the other men will be green with envy that you have what they don't.|`|ISjFdI1taa	They're not part of the Autistic Spectrum.  More associated with depression I would think.  I have an Autistic nephew and I have had a relative with a Borderline Personality Disorder.  BPD is characterised by behaviour that hurts others and the individual concerned, but with no conscience, ie, the person does not feel any guilt or see any wrong doing on their part when they behave badly.  I'm not a medical professional by the way, but I have experience of a child with autism and an adult with BPD (who was very difficult to deal with and did not have low self esteem, more a heightened sense of their own importance).  The only thing you can do is continue to see your psychiatrist, who has the real medical/psychiatric knowledge.|`|AA11080047	i would say your bi-polar my self. but i not a psychiatrist i would ask for a second opinion.|`|gpO5thmSaa	i have asperger's.. you definately do not.  it sounds like extreme bi-polar.

oVxr5B3Eaa	It's very normal. The first few times you do it, your going to be VERY stressed out until you get your period, and maybe even after that too. I know I was, to the point that I went and got morning after pill even though we used a condom. Honestly, it is stressful... when you get your period, your going to be relieved... until you hear (or remember) that some people get their period when they're pregnant. If your still really worried, you can get dollarstore pregnancy tests to ease your mind.... Just have a couple of them around to use once a month or so (or buy them as needed in case your parents don't know.. it's only a dollar)...   After awhile, you'll realize it's safe, and all odds defy that you will get pregnant. Of course, there is always that tiny chance, but likely, it won't happen, as long as your take appropriate action if the condom breaks or something.   You WILL get over it eventually.   You should think about going on a second type of birth control, like the pill. That way, if you DO have an accident with the condom, your still protected, unlike now, if there is an accident, you have a chance of getting pregnant.   I went through it when I first started having sex.. And I've been on the pill for ages, but now I've just started having sex without a condom and just relying on the pill for about 3 months. It's much harder trusting something you can't see working. It's been difficult to just do it and not worry (as long as i'm taking the pill on time), but this month I just CANT WAIT for my period to come... 1 week away and I'm so anxious, but i know odds are AGAINST me getting pregnant.. However, once I get it I'm sure I'll be relieved.... That worry/paranoia will likely last a couple more cycles before I can trust it completely.     But hey, better to be worried.. then you'll always be careful. I'm sure that if you broke the condom or something, you'd go get Plan B, right?   Now image if you WEREN't worried? You be saying Ok to doing it without a condom and not do anything if there is an accident.... Then you'd have a baby on your hands.     Also remember that even without protection, you don't get pregnant every time you have sex.. Only about 1/12 times.     It's going to be stressful for a couple months but just try to trust it and think about getting some back up method, it will really ease your mind :)|`|x5MYW2LPaa	yes it's completely natural. Just make sure you arte using protection and get some tests to put your mind at ease if you are really worrying.|`|bry9Tk3Maa	you sound like my GF     DW its normal|`|NALCnkOEaa	You're pregnant get over it.

In general I think that we tend to be scared of the chance of getting pregnant is because neither the pill or condom are 100%.   As long as you are smart and protect yourself , try and relax and enjoy it.  Hope this helps.

WhIPx5aDaa	why not?    Navel lint, or more commonly belly button lint, belly button fluff or navel fluff, is an accumulation of fluffy fibers in one's navel.    Many people find that, at the beginning and end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. The reasons for this have been the subject of idle speculation for many years but in 2001, Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki of the University of Sydney, Australia, undertook a systematic survey to determine the ins and outs of navel lint. His primary findings were as follows:      * Navel lint consists primarily of stray fibers from one's clothing, mixed with some dead skin cells and strands of body hair.      * Contrary to expectations, navel lint appears to migrate upwards from underwear rather than downwards from shirts or tops. The migration process is the result of the frictional drag of body hair on underwear, which drags stray fibers up into the navel.      * Women experience less navel lint because of their finer and shorter body hairs. Conversely, older men experience it more because of their coarser and more numerous hairs.      * Navel lint's characteristic blue-gray tint is likely the averaging of the colors of fibers present in clothing; the same color as clothes dryer lint.      * The existence of navel lint is entirely harmless, and requires no corrective action.    Dr. Kruszelnicki was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for Interdisciplinary Research in 2002.    *  Graham Barker of Perth, Western Australia, is in the Guinness Book of Records as the record holder for collecting navel lint.     He has been collecting navel lint almost every day for over 20 years since 17 January 1984. He collects about 3.03 mg per day. Contrary to the research of Dr. Kruszelnicki, his lint is in a particular shade of red, even though he rarely wears red clothes.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	well hopefully ur taking showers everyday, cuz mine is lint free!|`|xmj1HGTBaa	Probably cuz you don't clean it enough.|`|6YTjC3Aqaa	well,....just clean it and don';t ask much

sn0V6bXAaa	It can cause a weak cervix - more likely with multiple abortions. So a woman could potentially have problems later when she's trying to sustain a pregnancy.     It can cause a tear in the uterine wall which can lead to bleeding - in extreme cases a woman could hemorrhage and potentially bleed to death.    If they don't remove all of the tissue and placenta, a woman can get an infection. If the infection is bad enough it can be a risk to life, especially if it results in a blood infection.    And of course any psychological effects.|`|jRdoDu3raa	causes trauma to the area. also mental issues....in worse cases it could kill the mother...how ironic ain't it  !!!|`|OpHex5QKaa	http://women.webmd.com/tc/abortion-befor...|`|gBAstki5aa	is sucks a fetus outta you..|`|FYvCR8mvaa	It results in the termination of pregnancy.  One minute you're pregnant, the next you're not.    The wife of a friend of my husband basically used abortion as a means of birth control while they were dating, (she had 8 over the years if I am not mistaken) and when they married and she decided she wanted a baby she couldn't carry one to term because the doctor had scraped a little too vigorously and caused the wall of her womb to weaken so much that it ruptured.  They raise fish.|`|4w9gmvumaa	If they get an abortion early, they can qualify for the abortion pill.  That means they will have to take a pill which stops the production of progesterine in the body, thus ending the pregnancy.  Then three days later, they insert 3 or 5 pills into their vagina.  Those pills cause the  uterus to start contracting and expells everything from the fetus.  It is supposed to feel like strong period cramps.  Then everything comes out like a heavy period, similar to a miscarriage.  They bleed for a while and that's all.  No affect on later pregnancies because no tools are used in the vagina, so there is no scar tissue.  Psychologically, it can cause stress for a woman so  there are the physical symptoms associated with that and guilt, maybe slight depression.  Besides that, their body goes back to the way it was before.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	It makes your Hormones run wild - they don't know what to do.  But the bigger question is, How does abortion effect the Soul and the Spirit.  It is an action you can NEVER rectify.  And I apologize for my personal view, but I had to give both sides.... because Medically, when the spirit is effected, it taxes your physical health as well.|`|AA10907244	I think it will affect you mentally more than anything; thus, stress and mental dwelling can cause several different problems.
QYXij5Wcaa	My assumption is yes. However, i cannot know without knowing your genes and the stage of your puberty.  Generally adults grow until they are a 25. Basing your height on others is not efficient as others grow at different rates.    Edit: I am sure you will grow  slightly taller, but I doubt anything over 5'10. But by assuming that you are young and that you eat well I am sure you will grow taller. If you wish to achieve a taller height I would recommend visiting a doctor and asking about HGH (human growth hormone) .|`|07bX5jGsaa	It's different for everybody, I'm 14 and in 9th grade and am as tall as my dad, which is almost 6 feet.

80npJDM2aa	I wake up with loss of feeling in my hands as well, this is because I sleep on one side almost all night long or for several hours, could be a pinched nerve.  or if it's still happening you might have poor circulation of blood in your body, for that I would just try to take some vitamins on a regular basis, your iron might be low.  As far as carpel tunnel goes, I don't know how old you are but I have the beginnings of it about right above my wrists.  It feels like a pinched nerve so that could be it.  Not much you can do except try to use proper typing posture.  Typing improperly for years can cause this (I worked a hotel and i'm 5'9, the pc counter was way to low and forced me to type at an acute angle.)  All I can do for that is when it inflames, I use Ibuprofin its supposed to have an anti imflammatory quality to it.  It helps when it isn't that bad.  Worse case like my other hotel coworker, she used a wrist brace.  Also when it pinches I grab some lotion and spend about five minutes trying to massage it.  Also try "stretching" your fingers and wrists gently.  They are muscles and tendons as well that need to be exercised.        Hope this helps!|`|RUCrhhWuaa	flip your hand upside down|`|H0aiDO9Paa	This is peripheral neuropathy, can have a number of causes. Probably the most common is mechanical pressure on a nerve. Under compression, the first nerve fibers to lose function are the ones that conduct sensation. As the sensory fibers "go to sleep," the first signal perceived is the familiar 'pins-and-needles" tingling sensation. Also vitamin B12 supplementation quickly resolved the numbness. And good luck.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	usually the pins and needles feeling is when that part of ur body "falls asleep" due to decreased blood flow. like when u sit with ur legs a certain way

hQIqEnTEaa	The "tube" you're referring to is a grommet. It is put in the ears of children who have recurrent middle ear infections. They allow pus and infected material to drain out through the ear canal when infection is present.    These tubes are only temporary. It would have been removed anyway. The doctor is correct, the grommet only needs to be replaced if your son has further recurrent ear infections. When the tube came out there would be a small hole is his ear drum. This will heal over time and not cause any permanent problems. Your son will eventually need to have the grommet in his left ear removed also.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	WHAT!!!  Can you say LAWSUIT??    How old is your son?  He could need that tube in his ear for years to come!  You will have to pay for re-inserting it and as you know he has to be put under to do it.    Bring your son back to the ear specialist and tell him what happened and let him assess.    And I disagree with the person above, most times the tubes fall out on their own when it's time and your son could possibly get an infection right now thanks to the fine doc.    Why didn't he just irrigate it which would have been safer?  He obviously dug too deep there.|`|EDwlTWLwaa	if you don't trust the doctor, take your son to another doctor & get a second opinion on the matter.|`|EKT1qvyXaa	wow! what kind of a doctor is this!go to a diff doc and ask
LYeMqJIRaa	I wish I had the other posters luck but after almost 9 months I have only had one or two that reached a 5 out of ten. Most of the time I am ok until point of ejaculation then all feeling stops.  There is no longer that sense of "emptying" nor the release and relaxation feeling afterward. It basically has the satisfaction of a sneeze.  I was fine one day before the snip and eight days later "nothing".  However now several months later I have chronic pain (caused by pressure build up) and will have to have additional surgery the day before Valentines Day (adds insult to injury).   Urologists will tell you what I am experiencing does not exist but will also admit that they have never studied the phenomenon instead dismissing it as being "all in your head."  But after desperate searching I have found many other men who have experienced the same thing (Perhaps its group psychosis).  If you go through with it good luck.  Personally it has torn my life apart.  It is a good form of birth control though because between the loss of good sensations and the pain I don't crave sex anymore.

rpnFxnCQaa	Physical Therapy (PT): emphasizes the acquisition of basic motor skills necessary for functional mobility about the school environment as well as the physical capability for participating with peers during education and recess. Areas of focus for the school physical therapist include:     - Gross motor skills: activities that use large muscles     - Mobility skills: moving safely throughout the school environment, including entering and exiting the school bus     - Postural control and alignment needed to perform school activities and for increasing independence in life skills     Occupational therapy (OT): emphasizes the acquisition of or compensation for functional performance skills needed by students during their educational experience:     - Fine motor skills: small, finely coordinated hand movements     - Visual perceptual skills: the ability to understand and interpret what is seen     - Visual motor skills: the ability to coordinate visual skills and motor skills     - Self care skills: feeding, dressing, hygiene, and toileting skills for increasing independence in necessary life skills     Both physical and occupational therapists may address the following areas:     - Strength and endurance     - Body awareness     - Classroom positioning and adaptations     - Sensory motor skills necessary for participation in an educational program       Physical therapists and occupational therapists have similar training. Occupational therapists receive more training in oral and hand skill interventions and physical therapists receive more training gross motor and postural development.|`|5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	For the most part, they work in similar settings: hospitals, clinics, schools, etc.     In some cases, their job overlaps.  In our clinic, PTs will see all orthopedically related problems, except those with the elbow or hand. OTs will do the elbow or hand.  Yet, in the same clinic, an OT will see the patient for neurologically related shoulder disorders as well as the hand or elbow.  This is where it can vary a little bit from setting to setting.    More globally speaking, OTs help patients overcome functional impairments that are related to fine motor, cognitive processing, sensory impairement or self care. It might be learning how to button a shirt, prepare a meal, write a sentence, bathe themself,  etc.      Physical therapy on the otherhand, helps patients overcome more gross motor impairments: walking, running, balance, throwing, lifting, etc.

pQUr9a5Daa	Low-calorie, high-fiber foods such as fruits(dates) and vegetables fill you up but don't add that much to your daily calorie total.    These foods work because they provide plenty of water and fiber for very few calories.    Here are some ways to add volume to your diet while lowering the number of calories:         Add whole grains. Whole grains contain more fiber than refined grains and have slightly fewer calories.       Eat your non-starchy vegetables. Not only are they good for you, they also can help you lose weight.       Have a green salad. Starting lunch or dinner with a simple green salad topped with low-calorie or fat-free dressing can help you feel fuller, so you will eat fewer calories during that meal.       Include fruit. Fruit is generally low in energy density because it's high in water.       Don't forget protein. Eating enough protein-rich, lower-calorie foods increases satiety and slightly increases metabolism.       Switch to water. Water is the number one weight-loss choice when it's chosen as an alternative to beverages containing lots of calories. You can get your water via unsweetened tea or coffee, flavored unsweetened mineral water, tap water with lime or lemon, or calorie-free soft drinks.|`|7eJj4FnYaa	No, they are high calorie and simple sugar.|`|w1kvhxX5aa	sure if its a running date he he he|`|2HH1PSnVaa	If you guys have sex
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	stop eating meat    alot of people don't realize it but meat is the number one cause of fat (not including soaked grease things)|`|SHkBWCOvaa	Eat only 3-4 times a day.

If you eat 1000 less calories a day, you will lose 2 pounds a week.    You can either take those calories out of your diet or plan out exercising that will burn off those amount of calories.

Best to wear a night guard (protective rubberized material) before sleeping.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes it is wearing them down can cause you not to be able to cut and crew your food properly and can cause TMJ and that is not fun to deal with.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	yes, u need a mouth guard|`|Pdex43zgaa	No, as long as you use the right blade.|`|uJDCoXH9aa	Well duh.|`|jRdoDu3raa	Absolutely, wears them down, removes the enamel and causes premature tooth loss and or tooth aches>>|`|ebD1plKNaa	Grinding your teeth today will cause no noticeable difference tomorrow.  But if it is a habit, over time you are asking for problems.  If you were down the enamel too much, you will need caps or may need to have teeth pulled prematurely.  You can also develop a very painful condition called TMJ (lockjaw), which will make things like talking, eating, drinking, even swallowing, very uncomfortable for you.  If you must grind teeth, make sure they are somebody else'.|`|baW9u4yLaa	yes...it wears them down prematurely...    If you grind while you sleep I'd recommend getting a dental guard / stent made up to wear at night...|`|gBAstki5aa	yes it wears down the enamel.|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	no i do it all the time and i dip snuff      east side baby
ebD1plKNaa	Different people have different pain levels.  It also depends some on the dentist, and your exact dental condition when the tooth was pulled.  Most people experience a little pain to mild discomfort.  Some have a lot, particularly if it gets infected.|`|dvd19200aa	sometimes yes. I have had 3 removed and after one I went back to work the same day|`|838a01bb0df6225499d20e0502eaf376aa	I think the pain level partly depends on how the wisdom teeth were removed. Were they able to pull them? Or did an oral surgeon have to surgically remove them? My wisdom teeth were fully erupted by the time I was 15 and when one became abscessed last year (I was 33 at the time) the dentist recommended pulling it rather than a root canal since it was just a wisdom tooth and I did not have insurance. Since the tooth was fully erupted from the gums, he was able to pull it with no cutting. Immediately following the removal, I felt a bit of pain and took some Ibuprofen and never had to take another. I think it's just one of those horror stories people like to tell or they don't have as high of a pain threshold as we do. Anyway, we'll just be thankful it didn't hurt as bad as they told us it would!|`|nsGBwXCTaa	it is soppost to do that
TKNPveHDaa	Water.  That's the best drink.    Slimfast, Hydroxycut, the only thing those drinks make you do is go to the bathroom a lot.  Because you're now dehydrated, you see some water weight come off the scale.  So, you're not really losing weight, you just have less water in your body.    As soon as you drink water and go off the products, the weight comes back.  But it's a sham.  All those products aren't healthy.|`|6PQ5tT9Aaa	Try slim fast and Hydroxy cut!

I would encourage you to visit this great site: www.healthsavings.ourperfectcard.com I signed up online over 5 years ago now and they have saved me thousands of dollars. From root canals, xrays, extractions, xrays, root canals...etc. All services are included in this very affordable plan. Even my braces. They even had my very affordable plan active in 2 hours and was able to use it the very same day. good luck and hope this helps you out..|`|rrII5zbDaa	If at all possible save any tooth that can be saved. In the long run you will be glad to have your natural tooth. Replacing extracted teeth later can be expensive and time-consuming.

jCQXXPHWaa	What did you do?    It could be a sprain, but i can't see it and would need more info on what happened. so here is some good general advice for any new injury.    Ice the area for 20Min's every hour , EVERY HOUR!!!!    Take ibuprofen (if you can). (this not only hels with pain but also with the swelling)    Sleep with your foot elevated (on pillows or something)    Wrap an ace bandage around it for support and to get the swelling out.    Hope this helps

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|ivg0lRUraa	First thats not a good idea, very not good for you.  But if you're going to, you can try running with garbage bag suit under sweatsuit & eating minimal.  Thats how we cut weight in wrestling.|`|D6AYSUvsaa	Heh, yea if you have some way to exercise, maybe a treadmill, if not take a jog outside for at least 30 minutes. Also try to mix your exercise in with eating healthy, no junk food. If you want it to be that fast I don't advise you eat even a little bite. Probably should check the amount of calories.|`|Gl5nWoeSaa	eat little quantities of crap food like salad|`|mXYxRsB5aa	I wouldn't advise you to fast totally as you will feel faint etc, you could try doing a detox , just eat organic fruit and smoothies     good luck|`|iQOqQGEpaa	first day eat only apples and salads and second day go without food. drink only water with lemon.|`|6N4NoM6uaa	Chop off a limb.|`|8sYPIgUraa	eat nothing but veggies and fruits. Also eat grapefruit, it helps burn fat. drink lots of water. Good luck!|`|rdVlcdQXaa	fasting wont do much in 2 days actaully not much will   exercise your butt off!   drink water only or green tea  and try calorie reducing foods   best of luck!|`|kLK2peV1aa	okay. dont eat until dinner. put on a coat a sweatshirt a long sleeve  shirt 2 pairs of sweatpants a beanie wool socks (or multiple pairs)  after dressing in this play wii boxing for a few house or go run a lot on the treadmill.   (dont run outside)  my friend did this routine for a week for wrestling and lost fifteen lbs.|`|NpdAmv2Uaa	Get the flu and vomit all day and sweat.. Maybe cutt off all your hair.|`|xXhuxyMkaa	About 0.5kg per week you can lose fat; more than that is lost as water and muscle. Don't go on crash diets, please.    You can half- fast; eat vegetables, fruit, almonds ( protein!), herbal teas and plenty of water. In this way you clean your guts. Getting rid of the waste matter accumulated in your bowels make you look slimmer, naturally, since the swelling around the lower abdomen is reduced.    If you are healthy this should be safe. Any medical condition, regular medication, suspected pregnancy or being pregnant requires a doctor's check up if you want to make drastic changes in your diet.

BXSlZEfBaa	Drink diuretics like tea. Diuretics will help your body release excess water. Avoid salt as much as possible, it will cause you to retain water. Also, drink you normal amount of water that your body is used to. If you dehydrate yourself, your body will hold onto the water that it has. These thing should help.|`|AA10482502	Drink a lot of water  and your body will realize that you don't need it all  and flush it out   i'm not sure if it would be able to work in two days  but you might as well give it a try!  good luck  PS be prepared to use the bathroom a lot!
Lf1GMmyaaa	Dude you are in for it!    Been there done that.  Here's the thing when you come out of boot camp you will be lean and mean.  When I was in the Army everyone there was out of shape, even the so called fat people were (no pun intended) for example: the ones who had weight issues came out looking like buff football players.  They will put everyone on the same diet and everyone on the same fitness program at first.  They may make groups of fast paced people and slower paced people, but I can assure you when you come out you will be lean and a strong build...not to worry they are going to whip you into shape fast.    Good Luck and thanks for defending our country!    PS: Your recruiters may begin to take you on pt in advance of leaving just to give you an idea of what to expect.

sgPG1CL0aa	if your weight trainging and want to build up muscle then you should have protein and carbohydrates mainly.    if your on weight loss its important to have a low calorie (1200-1500) diet with more fruit, veg and wholemeals.|`|zLsj2NGmaa	There is a great resource with free articles and information over at http://www.fastweightlosetoday.com .

You should rather just skip the suger and fat and eat normal food. eat 5 times a day and exercise.     I
2ydP2Wyzaa	It is a virus, has many types.  It causes genital warts, cervical cancer, and anal cancer. Most times, HPV infections are asymptomatic for years.  HPV induces skin and epithelial cells proliferation (causing either warts or cancer). It causes 95% of all cervical cancer cases (which is the third cause of death from cancer in women), it is contracted by sexual activity (it is an STD), or by direct contact with a lesion; it can also be transmitted to a child during birth, in which case it causes the child to grow warts in troath, and upper airways.    There are 2 vaccines available, Gardasil and Cervarix. Both should ideally be given before the woman has sexual activity (to be sure she doesn't have the virus already)
483e49b9ba8ea322e76bb65dc8f82a66aa	Nope, its totally safe. I have given a few little sparrows and other small birds some before when they flew into the window and got stunned and they were fine with a few drops. It wont make you drowsy either. Try to do some deep slow breathing and focus on one thing, such as a number or a blank piece of paper, it will take a bit but you can clear your mind doing that and calm down. I get really scared of things too, and was scared of my driving test but I passed it just fine. You will be fine, and if you did fail, you just take it again. Not a big deal:)
80npJDM2aa	from personal experience, It sounds like you are pinching your sciatic nerves at the bottom of your back, and then they kinda run down the backsides of your hips to legs. I have been bed ridden for a full day and could hardly move.      I recommend going to walmart and getting a heating pad and an cool compress of some sort.  They usually have them in the medical center.  The person above me is also right, lift less for now, and try to be more aware of what you are sleeping on for your posture.      Try ibuprofin it is supposed to have an anti-inflammatory property. (but dont overdose lol) its found in the walmart medical area as well.  Soaking in a hot bath can also help.    Also being a woman for right now try to choose comfortable shoes and stay away from high heels as they throw off your natural posture.      my back problems started with a knee problem.  if you have injured something else or you arent wearing the right kind of shoes, you can hurt your body because it will try to compensate for the weaker part.  IE)  I hurt my left knee so I babied it when i walked.  so I used my right leg more.|`|m3rt9x8Caa	you may just need a poo :)|`|HyulW3aiaa	Google symptom checker and follow the simple guide.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	It's probably pain from the strain of having larger boobs.  Unfortunately there is no cure unless the rest of you is overweight also.  In some cases you can lose weight and it should ease some of the pain.  I am forced to live with chronic back pain because I cannot afford reduction.  The next time you have to go to the doctor mention it to them and ask them to put something in your file if they conclude it is because of that.  If you should ever seek such surgery you need at least a year of documented chronic pain.  Best of luck.|`|AA12386598	If the pain is more around your periods you do need a consult.  If it is present all the time but increased on activity, the following will help.  1. Sleep on a firm surface.  2. Improve your posture. Sit up straight and walk and stand while pulling yourself up to your maximum height.  3. When you have to pick something up try to keep your lower back straight and do most of the movement at your knee joints.  4. Avoid painkillers as the dulling of the pain will lead you to make movement that will aggravate your problem.  Trust me big boobs are not a cause, though a joke in movies and sitcoms.|`|Ub58rubRaa	this is most probably Sciatica,everyone gets it,especially   women,xxx

I don't think they need your social and its pretty easy to get an appointment.     While you're there, I'm pretty sure they offer free STD testing. 1 in 4 people have one and most don't know it, so its always a good idea to get tested. You'll be there anyway, after all.|`|jL9myhmqaa	i think it needs to be perscribed|`|winmjHAmaa	You have to visit your family doctor.  She will most likely need a pap test.  My sis-in-law is trying to get on the pill and this is what every dr has told her.  My dr gave it to me w/out the test cause she has seen my family and me since I was born and she new I wasn't active.  Unless your gf can prove that, they will probably make her have the test.  It's not that bad though and you have to get it done every year then.  So...she will need her health insurance card and co-pay.|`|NALCnkOEaa	You have to wait in a train track until it comes by you.

TTpf5tlMaa	The scary thing about herpes is the lack of symptoms.  Even those who experience the symptoms don't have them at all times.  So basically, you cannot use symptoms as a gauge for herpes.    Secondly, it sounds like his first check up was shortly after his potential contraction of the disease.  The culture may not have reached the point, at that time, to where it would show on a test.    Finally, yes, it is possible that the second test, the one that came up positive, has made a mistake.  Mistakes on such tests are far more common than people realize.  What he needs to do is go get a third, and maybe even a fourth, opinion.  If really cares about you and really doesn't want you to get it, then he will go see a specialist immediately so that he can get this situation resolved.    Addition:  Please understand that yes, you can contract herpes even if he is not experiencing an outbreak.|`|2ydP2Wyzaa	It's not likely that he never had any symptoms, he could have had the sores inside the urethra, and mistaken the symptoms with an UTI. If he already has a test positivie, most like to be is that he IS positive, if you both want to feel sure, take a third test.   Assuming he does have herpes, remember that as long as you two don't have sex when he's having an outbreak, you're safe, besides there are drug he can use to avoid outbreaks, and drugs you can take to prevent getting it.     An STD like this might either end your relationship, or make it much stronger,  it's all up to you!  As a woman, my best advice, would be to treat him just as you'd like to be treated if in his shoes    Good luck!!
jXwHiAaWaa	i don't think the room should be too full because your mind is already cluttered; but at the same time not too bare because this would feel like you were in a prison.    definately a plant in the room because they sort of symbolise freshness don't they and if it's well watered it kinda makes you feel a bit brighter.    gotta have comfy chairs, even if they aren't sofas, just padded chairs that aren't uncomfortable or too high up.    i would disagree with people who want sofas to lie down on because i would feel uncomfortable lying in front of my therapist and counsellor. i have terrible anxiety and i wouldn't lie down on it, in fact the open-ness of the couch would make me feel vulnerable. i prefer chairs with arms so i feel safer. there is something about arms that make you feel safe i think.    a nice window so if you feel awkward you can stare out of it and the room should not be too hot or cold, but if one or the other, definately not cold. warm to me symbolises comfort.    a picture on the wall but not too patronising like a group of teenagers having fun. like some flowers or something.    tissues on a small table in the middle so you know you're safe if you cry. the table also would make me feel safer if its in between me and the listener.    =]|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I've seen psychiatrists etc and am being put on the waiting list for therapy.  To be honest, Im not really bothered what the room is like, Im more concerned about the therapist. The room shouldnt be too hot though and I wouldnt like it if there was no window.  I'd like the seat the be comfortable so I could relax.  I think it'd be better if there isnt any posters on the wall with information etc, or anything that you cause my mind to wander and distract me from what Im talking about with the therapist.  I think a neutral wall paint like magnolia or pale lemon would be nice.|`|mBUfy9zMaa	Cozy.  I want it to have an "at home" kind of feeling.  My therapist has a few chairs, but I much rather prefer a couch.  Something I can spead out on and relax.  Maybe a few nice pictures and flowers.  And a window with a nice view.  Lol, Im probably too picky but that would be nice.|`|fMLBPUVeaa	comfortable chairs!! and a table, and a window. keep it simple, not too many colors or anything. maybe some flowers, and make sure it's not too hot or too cold in there.|`|QjwBMQbjaa	Hey    I have seen various mental health professionals including counsellors and a therapist. I find the rooms are usually pretty plain as not to cause distraction to the clients thoughts or to the counsellor/therapist.     I think as long as the room isn't too small, is private and the seats are comfortable then I am usually fine with it. Sofas or large soft chairs are usually the best. It helps if the room has a window to provide light however it if faces onto a busy area its best to make sure that no one can see in as this will make a client feel like their privacy is invaded.   I always think it is nice if the session is going to last a period of time that you are asked as a client if you are comfortable or would like a drink but only some places do this and it can depend on who the service provider is.    I think it is really the counsellor who makes the experience comfortable or not, a warm and friendly personality can make any room feel welcoming.    best of luck  x|`|HAhm1TUoaa	Comfortable. I would hate it to have a "clinical" feel. I have my first CBT session soon and I'm dreading going in case the centre feels sterile, like a hospital. I would like the room to be cosy but simple.

Neuharth"    I too had this kind of problem earlier when I was kid. But when I grew-up and started watching others perform various things successfully, I learned that if you want to achieve something it's you who have to attempt. Think you are alone and nobody is there to help, or think you have all the world with you and all all around you are your friends or nears. There is nobody stranger to you and start believing and acting like you know all these people and places. I have travelled many countries in my last 10 years. And I never had a single situation where I felt I am alone or helpless. When ever I went I just took a deep breath and acted as a cool normal guy, "never get excited" that's what I tell to myself.

She wakes up, Yells at my dad for about an hour and a half about crap from 10 years ago, threatens him with going to see a lawyer and she wants him to sell the house and ****, then she leaves.He usually takes his car and follows her. they come back home and fight some more. I have been with my boyfriend for about 3 and a half years...he has been to my house about 4 times. I wont let him come here...it is so ridiculous. My siblings and I are normal...its my parents who cant control their trashy ways.  To sum it up...here are my tips:  -Stay out of your mothers way, so she can't hit you  -Don't bother talking to her when she is acting 'crazy'  -Talk to someone: a teacher, a doctor, a counselor  -If you drive; just leave when you don't feel comfortable  -If you don't drive; call a friend to pick you up    I hope this helps. I mean, you can always e-mail me if you need anything.  aol- klily73@aol.com  aim- klily73|`|fMLBPUVeaa	sounds tough, yeah it sounds like she needs help. if i were you and i had  some friends  i would try to stay away from home and hang out with them most of the time. or do sports or dance or something. i think she should see a therapist maybe, but if i were you i wouldn't be the one to tell her that. does she have any friends that could help convince her to do that??|`|x3EPqezJaa	Wow, I'm sorry about that. Yes, it sounds like your mother has some kind of mental disorder. Is there any relative you can talk to about this, to get some help?|`|7lDzcZu7aa	call a doctor if you are concerned.

It is abuse and whether your mom can help it or not you shouldn't have to endure this type of treatment.|`|AA10883009	Take her to a Psychiatrist,who can help you in such matters.The treatment is always result producing and you can note the difference in her behavior in a short span of time|`|97e814a40a8c6926c7be27ed5e46d04faa	sounds like she had lost her mind, you better get her to help asap. i've seen people talk to themselves alone, then one of them i saw again and she turned worst, she had really lost her mind. she just walk in the street in dirty clothes and picking up trashes.    i hope your mom will get better.|`|Hhwzp6Iwaa	Do you have another adult figure to talk to or stay with?  My advice would be to pray to God about it and ask him to fix the situation for you.  He will start to move things for you.  Don't do anything stupid or drastic but you must find a way to dismiss yourself from the situation.  You have been going through this for way too long, but God will deliver you from this. All you have to do is ask him and RUN to him.  Let me know how it goes.  I will pray for you and especially for your mother.
pfHBBJH4aa	This works for me.  Give it a try.  I sleep on my side, kinda in the fetal position.  Then fold a pillow and put it between your legs.  It keeps the pressure off of your back.  Hope this helps.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	The person should sleep, pillow less, in one of the following arrangements: on a very firm mattress, with a bed board under the mattress, on a water bed or even on the floor. A folded towel beneath the low back and a pillow under the knee may increase comfort. And good luck.|`|PAwQLtYcaa	sleep on right side put be pellow onther top leg|`|iwNoqspTaa	Hey!    What's important with lower back pain is to keep the Lumbar vertebrae in their correct anatomical position.    Humans naturally sleep on their sides, as it allows for pressure to be taken off the parts of the spine that control autonomous reflexes associated with survival. For example, your Thoracic vertebrae, and the various neurological impulses of which.    Anyway, scientific stuff aside:    Sleeping on either your left or right side, without exerting any torsion (twisting) or tension (bending) will be the closest thing without counseling from a Physiotherapist. I know not the nature of your condition, but if you're generally losing sleep, there are programs available from various physiotherapists that can help.    This article: http://backandneck.about.com/od/anatomye... promotes the 'freefall' position, and states that support is needed. I have no way of vouching for this, but the article is well researched.    One thing you may want to look into is not just your sleeping position, but also the softness/hardness of your mattress. Too soft means the heavier regions (Thoracic and Pelvic) will sag into the mattress, with the Lumbar region taking the stress. Too hard means the spine will not align properly.    Hope I was of some help, and I'd be eager to hear about your progress.    -Valravn.|`|8NbpkRpEaa	Your bed is too soft. If your body is sinking into the bed more than about 2 inches your not getting enough lumbar support. You may need a new bed. Meanwhile, you could place something on the bed that will build it up. I slept on top of a small piece of plywood (placed under a foam piece) until I got a firmer bed.|`|RUCrhhWuaa	My mom has back problems and she will lay on the floor and put her legs up on the couch for like an 30 minutes so just do that it really does work!
pFlkWQySaa	Ultra sound can detect the presence of stones. Depending on the size, you are in for an extremely uncomfortable time. The stones must pass from the kidney to the bladder, then through the urinary tract.   If the stones are large, they can blast them with sound waves to break them down.  I passed a large one, kidney to bladder, then fortunately had the sound waves prior to passing through urinary tract.   Sorry to say, but the pain is the worst i ever experienced. If Doctor recommends sound wave treatment...TAKE HIS/HER ADVICE.  I hope your wrong. You seem young to have developed them. If you have, I wish you the best possible.|`|19sa1ITfaa	alot of hurting seriously!!!!!!!!!|`|ypnWDDB8aa	ultra sound is used to detect stones.  If you do have kidney stones they will come out when you piss.  Drink lots of water, all the time.|`|s0XaZcj7aa	No ultra sounds cannot see kidney stones go to your doctor and pee in a cup they can find out by the contents     if you do   start taking some vicodens or tylonal threes or something cause you gonna have a helll of a night...|`|0eI1OcsQaa	Kidney stones  Kidney stones are small, hard crystalline lumps that can form in the kidneys. They can then travel to other parts of the urinary system blocking the flow of urine, and can cause infection and kidney damage. They can also be very painful.    What causes kidney stones and who can have them?  Its rare for a child to have a kidney stone. They are more usual in adults between the ages of 20-40.    There are several different reasons why kidney stones might develop in children. The most common cause is an infection of the urinary tract. In other cases, there are inherited problems that make the kidneys leak higher amounts of stone-forming substances, such as calcium, oxalate, uric acid or cysteine. Also some medical treatment such as chemotherapy can be involved.    In some patients, an underlying cause cant be identified.    Doctors know that kidney stones are more likely to develop in people who dont drink enough fluids. When the body is dehydrated, the kidneys concentrate the urine to ensure the body loses as little water as possible. This also increases the concentration of stone-forming substances and can lead to stone formation.    What are the signs and symptoms of a kidney stone?   Sometimes there are no clear symptoms. A stone that remains in the kidney and is small enough not to interfere with normal kidney function is called a silent stone and many people never know they have one.    But if a stone interferes with normal flow of urine, or causes an infection, it can lead to symptoms including severe pain in the back or side, abdominal swelling, nausea and vomiting, fever and pain on passing urine and blood in the urine.    How is it normally diagnosed and treated?  A scan such as an X-ray or ultrasound scan can show the presence of most kidney stones. A CT scan typically shows the size and location of a stone very well.     Most stones are quite small and can pass out of the body in urine within a few days without the need for specific treatment. In some cases though the stone might be too big to be passed or may be causing damage or infection. There are several non-surgical treatment options including breaking the stone using a special machine that gives out shock waves and allows the stone to be passed normally in the urine. Sometimes though traditional surgery, making an incision (cut) in the kidney or ureter to remove the stone, may be the best option.    The best way to find out why a stone has developed is by having it analysed for its chemical composition. Therefore, if a stone is passed, it is very important to retrieve it, so your doctor can send it for analysis.|`|4Tk6GfPZaa	Sounds like you are pregnant. But answer to your question is most likely.|`|0Z7sxpbcaa	It isnt the most pleasurable thing but  the best two thing to drink are crystal light lemonade or ice water with lemon or lime.   the acid breaks up the calcium and help get rid of the stone faster|`|jTFdG8xqaa	The ultra sound should be able to detect a stone, any way the stone would cause inflammation in the kidney and the ultrasound can easily see that. If so the doctor's will want to figure the size of the stone and wether surgery is necessary. This is a very common procedure and kidney stones happen to people all the time. They may be able to warn you about things in your diet that are setting this off and help it from happening again. It is wholly unpleasant from what i have heard and i hope to get away without ever having one, but i wish you the best of luck and am sure the doctors will be able to take care of your kidney stone problem. Feel better!|`|AyPOc8WNaa	From everything that I have heard ( my mother in law just had them) they hurt very very bad.  She had out paitient surgery to remove them.  The use to just wait until until they came out when you urinate  Horrible pain with that I guess.  Seriously you probably don't want to wait until Monday to see your doctor see if your parents will take you sooner.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	They will hurt but just drink lot's of cranberry juice  and stay in bed so you can heal fast|`|M3maZgdyaa	Lots of pain when you go! They have medicine to dissolve stones and they can break them up with ultrasound. Good luck and I feel your pain Och|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Yes.  Ultrasounds pick them up.  Once you start passing the stones the doctor should prescribe a pain killer to help you with the pain.  I won't lie to you.... it hurts....bad.... so bad that you will probably vomit from the pain.  Good luck hon.  I hope you pass them quickly.|`|gRyB5PXbaa	Yes it will detect it but i would rather go see a doctor now - you could land up in hospital - you can pick kidney stones up from a xray aswell.|`|KT0UTX8taa	Dont worry, you probably dont have it! But even if you do It's nothing serious, and there is a lot of ways to treat it! I know that drinking a lot of fluids help them get away, as well as a lot of beer, but you are too young so dont drink beer! There is also some very good natural herbs and teas that you can make, to help those annoying things go away... There is a difference between stones, sand and tiny crystals... you are too young for big kidney stones! They will be detected in an ultrasound even the smallest ones!
8bh0IGwJaa	Go to the store (pharmacy store) and get a yeast infection kit.  Does not sound like yours is too far advanced, so you caught it early.  Get the kind where you insert cream or a gel tab inside you at bed time.|`|NAIkcKssaa	Personally i would call the doctor that gave you the antibiotic and tell them you have yeast infection totally common. he may put you on diflucan much better than creams. creams don't seem to work for me. Your doctor is the only one who should make the decision for you.|`|wqmD44ceaa	EAT YOUGURT!!  When you are put on antibiotics and if you know ahead that you almost always get yeast infections it is always good to have yougurt on hand and ask for diflucan it is a medicine for yeast infection.  Another thing that helps and I know it's gross, but if you have a yeast infection in your privates plain yougurt on a pad helps that is if you don't work or go to school, but at night after school or work if you put some on a pad it will help cool it off and make you feel better. About an hour works.  You may think I am nuts but it works, I have done it more than once, It's cold but think of it this way, the yeast is hot and itches and this will cool it off.
f05KdsZkaa	it won't last forever|`|AA10405438	I've had depression on and off for years.  She will be fine and may never go through it again. Love her, be patient.  Try to get her out doing things you know she'd enjoy.  The best thing to do for her is listen.  She isn't looking for you to solve her problems, she just needs to vent.  Good Luck!|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Could be in her genes. Could be a period in her life. Could be emotional stress from growing up.

Much like you may have symptoms of the flu.....these could be symptoms of depression.|`|52dd0e9e5ef6819405d5c9c333849d70aa	Depression is as different as each person is! Some people have it all their lives, although it can come and go in 'episodes', which can be, like, a couple of weeks to a few months to a couple of years, often with periods of happiness and satisfaction in between. Some people find it changes over the years, maybe their experience of it is different or perhaps they learn to live with it better or manage it better. Some people learn to see the positive side and adapt. Some people (me, for example), find that it has eased and got better over the years till it's not as huge a problem, whereas others (my best friend) have a single, bad episode at some point in their lives but then get over that and never suffer with it again at all. Some people find they need medication for life to manage the condition, some just use it when they need to, some don't find it helpful at all. It can be really hard to know, for a single person, what their experience of depression might be, but to answer your question, yes it can be cured (for some), yes it can be managed (for others), no, it isn't a life sentence (for most). Think of it like, say, back pain - who knows how long or how badly someone might have back pain when there are so many different reasons for it? Good luck to you and your friend. Hx|`|cj7CYD9haa	simple answer for u    could be born with it    could simply suffer from a weak brain that makes her more likely to get depressed    or simply could beacome better when whatever is wrong in her world beacomes better.    She is most likely a combination of all things and little stuff can bring her down.|`|6HIuqEUyaa	It goes away with determination and help. The person will need to want to get over it. Also it is not something that you will wake up and it will be gone, patience is important. Just let her/him know you are always there for them. If you see them looking down or anything, do things to take there mind of it. Things they would normally enjoy. I am young and was told I had deppression, not sure if I did or if I was just really sad, but I got over it with help from friends and counsolers and will power. At first I did not except I had a problem, so I did nothing to help myself. But once I had realised I did have a problem, it became much easier to help myself. Hope your friends ok soon (:|`|FYdq7RVLaa	Depends on the depression.Can be social(when outside social problems are the problem) or inheritary and there are all different sorts. Many people can have it on a short time basis for a while,others it's with them all their life! I know you say not to go and get help but it is important to find out what kind of depression she's got and the sort of help available to her.Maybe she needs medication which there is no shame in taking. All you can do is be supportive towards her and reassure she is loved and wanted,make her feel loved and wanted all the time and tell her how important she is to you.She will have a low self esteem and self image with it as well so let her know how great she looks too.Good luck.
dFE54Nzraa	Why do you wanna know at this point? You need to lose weight, obviously. There is no way to find out until you look somewhat ideal.       If I were to make an educated guess, you are quite possibly an ectomorph, but it's weird because ectos are supposed to have a hard time putting on weight. You are not meso, you don't have enough muscle to be meso.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	mesomorph...  endomorphs are people who are "obese" and your not obese by any stretch, u just got a bit of a pop-belly|`|HPtpfqFJaa	Mesomorph|`|PIG9DzYVaa	You are an endomorph.|`|RnxxYn8gaa	Those body types you mentioned change as we grow. It's perfectly normal to be an ectomorph, and then develop into a mesomorph.  Ectomorphs carry the tall and skinny characteristics  Endomorphs carry the short stubby characteristics  Mesomorphs are in between ectomorph and endomorph. They are not as short and stubby as the endomorph, nor as tall and skinny as the ectomorph.    I believe most people are characterized as mesomorphs.    I'd say you've developed well into a little mesomorph.    They sound like something from middle earth don't they?  Frodo we must pass through valley of the morphs, first we must brave the deep underground caverns of the vicious endomorphs who aren't fond of strangers come to steal their treasures. Then it's through is through the valley of the mesomorphs that expands from Gondor to great forest of the ectomorphs, and is filled with wild beasts, one of which, if we should be so unfortunate as to stumble into one, you will never even know because it will have killed you long before you realized it was stalking you.  Then we come to the great forest of the Ectomorphs which borders Mordor, where we can destroy the ring. In this great forest lives the tall spiring ectomorphs. Experts with the bow to rival even the forest elves. They stand as high as ten feet and are as quick as a jack rabbit in the trees. They hate much of the outside world for it is the outside world which cuts down their home. And we must be ever so wary for they are all the more enraged by the recent actions of saurumon, or however you spell his name, and the forest he's razed to build his armies. The only hope we have there is to befriend the giant ents which mutually inhabit the great forests of the area.    Anyway, I hope you understand now what you are.

The sex thing is just some stupid advertisement  But good for you, you think your better|`|uRslUTLyaa	It's absolutely true.    Not only is better sex and better tasting genital juices one benefit, but there's other great side effects to being a vegan or even vegetarian.    I have been meat-free for over 4 years now, and a vegan for 5 months. The healthy aspects are clearly visable.    -No morning breath anymore  -No body odor  -No more acne  -Healthier skin  -Better sex, longer lasting, more intense  -No more migraines (i woke up with one every morning.)  -No more joint pains  -I have yet to catch the flu/cold/bronchitis bug this season, even being around hundreds of people who have been continuously sick.    Diets are leading causes to most aliments, believe it or not. You are what you eat.  Meat can cause:  -Alzheimer's  -Bowel cancer.  -Breast cancer  -E. coli  -Joint damage  -Osteoporosis  -Diabetes (look up "Simply Raw" for a neat documentary on how diabetes was reversed on a 30 day raw diet)  -High cholesterol  -Heart Disease  And many other common diseases.    Milk on the other hand is known to give problems with headaches, being my aliment, and osteoporosis as well as joint damage.    And if you think about it, we're not supposed to be consuming these products so frequently. Our omnivorous teeth are primarily designed to grind more plant material than your daily charcoal grilled NY strip.    And eventually this all leads down to the big question of "Does meat add to impotency?" Of course the answer's yes. The penis is a vampire; surviving on the extra blood that is send down there. Now is you're consuming something that is high in your blood clogging chemicals,  isn't it a wonder that your little member is going to be sadly losing a strong amount of blood? I've also heard, I haven't had time yet to experiement, that consuming foods, such as fruits like pomegranate and kiwi, that are naturally high in fructose, will make a man's juices taste as sweet as a mid-morning's cool breeze. Well. Not really, but I'm sure if anything, it makes it taste less like chlorox bleach.        Let it be noted, however, I hate PETA's stance on vegetarian/vegan education. Torturing your interns to sit out coated in seran wrap in the hot sun wearing only bikinis? Really? That doesn't make me want to be vegetarian at all.      Eat your McDonald's if you want, but the research is there. The food pyramid is actually a lying *****.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	I just ignore all their stuff.

I don't think they can do any oral...isn't that all animal product, our body fluids?|`|kogsyGAPaa	Because they will try anything to convince a person to not eat meat heehee. It's scary but there are many people out there that fall for stupid studies like that!  Although, i heard that what you eat can have an effect on how a person tastes and smells haha!|`|YCXxP43Laa	I'd never heard of that either. I have found that in general vegans tend to be healthier than vegetarians; only due to the fact that a lot of vegetarians tend to eat a lot of cheese and other dairy products, which are higher in saturated fat. Another reason why this theory is being postulated maybe because vegans tend to eat a high amount of seeds, pumpkin seeds in particular are high in zinc, which can increase sex drive. Also as vegans wouldn't eat a high, saturated fat diet they would be less prone to heart disease, diabetes etc, which can lower sex drive, and in whole vegans tend to be more body conscious than the rest of us, meaning they would exercise more too.    On the hand, non-haem iron sources (i.e. non-meat) are notoriously less well-absorbed than haem iron (meat) sources, which can lead to anaemia and tiredness, and less interest in sex overall.  I agree with you that no one should force their personal beliefs on anyone else, but I guess the reasons I stated first may be the theory behind this.|`|Y2CkerIhaa	Its just an Ad maybe.

Do you know that they can take your kids away from you here in Canada if you smoke around them in your house or in your car?    Yes sirree.  I feel for you so much.  This is why kids have asthma and I can't believe the USA is so backwards that people still smoke in public places and parents care so little they cant step outside to have a cigarette.    Keep breaking their cigarettes too and threaten to go to Children's Aid.  You are right to be so upset.    It SHOULD be illegal for them to smoke in the house when they have children.    Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.    Maybe you should set a standard so these people learn to take life and their children more seriously.  Otherwise they should not be entitled to kids.    And we should be in awe of YOU GUYS?  I think not.    What a pitiful example you adults set for your kids.    Get a petition going, get all kinds of kids to sign it (put one up on a web page) and then send it to your government official...better  yet send it to a newspaper or 60/60 or something.    Write Oprah....she is always one for great causes too.  Tell her you want to divorce your parents and why...should make for a great show.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	It is not illegal for them to smoke in the house sorry.     Breaking their cigarettes is really not going to help you at all? Its just going to make them irritated and it will do nothing for you and may make them less likely to want to do anything for you.    Try to sit down with them and let them know that it really physically bothers you. Apologize for breaking all their cigarettes and stuff but tell them you just can't deal with the smoke indoors. Don't go on about how you hate it, just that it causes you bad physical problems and you can't breathe, etc. Ask them to please smoke outside and see if you can set up an outside place or part of the garage for them to smoke? If they do that I would just give up on the outdoor smoking and just stay away from it. They shouldn't smoke indoors especially around nonsmokers though, that is really gross/unhealthy. Hope they go outside.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	There are laws about child endangerment. Explore your options. You'll get a lot of support.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	You're funny. Keep breaking those cigarettes. Fkn smokers.|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	Omg, you are sooooo sensitive, are you made of sugar or something? Tell your parents to respect you and smoke with the windows open or something. If they deny go find your own home, its THEIR house in the first place not yours.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	I just go to a different room    good luck|`|SU8z0TUoaa	You are overreacting! I suggest that you try smoking a few cigarettes a day until it doesn't bother you anymore, then you will be fine, and your family will probably be relieved. A bonus is that you will be bothered less by other irritants such as air pollution, hair spray, perfume, etc.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	I agree, firstly your sensitivity to smoking is contibuted by your parents and brother smoking around you probably since you were growing up.  Its not illegal but they should smoke outside and shouldn't have to breathe in their second hand smoke. Tell them that.  Move to your own place if you are old enough. Don't be in the same room when they are smoking. Leave lots of pictures around of ppl with lung and throat cancers, and say you are making me physically sick.
GhsqaXsdaa	My ortho said when it falls out that means it did its job, but you do have to go to either get it replaced if the others arent done, or get those metal things that connect braces.|`|e9dCXeuNaa	Your orthodontist put yours on for you?  I had to do mine myself,  not cool :(  But yeah, don't wait too long to get those back in|`|zEYjJ7Xhaa	you don't needs to rush in immediately, but you should plan to get in there in the next day or so.  Good luck.|`|K6R8VO6baa	You don't need to RUSH to the ortho but you should probably get there in the next day or two. With things like that, it could hold you treatment time back. Like you could have braces longer. =(  Hope this helps.     (Tell your mom the spacer fell out and she can make an appointment for you)
O57Ky6D0aa	Drinking water is a start, preferably bottled, Again avoiding foods that are bad for you or high in BAD fat like fast food, such a deep fat fried foods and also raw cane sugar also should be avoided. Foods to be eaten are ones rich in fatty acid(good fat) like fish such a salmon or tuna, nuts and seeds are a good option. But choose raw seeds and nuts not the roasted ones. I've read seaweed is also good for this. Then foods with antioxidants in such a berries, blueberries being the most beneficial but most other berries are good too. Carrots are also good. Green tea has many qualities but this is apparently supposed to help your skin also.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Any kinds of berries, strawberries and blueberries particularly. Melons such as cantaloupe and watermelon and salad vegetables such as lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes. Also almonds are good for your skin but not too many. Ten or so per day would be fine. Stay away from yeasty foods such as bread and milky foods such as cheese.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	salads
oVxr5B3Eaa	They're actually quite common to get them during the first 3 months, but they're usually lighter and shorter or not on the days they are supposed to be on. MANY people get them the first month and don't even realize it, because they don't know they are pregnant yet.   After the first 3 months it's pretty uncommon, though some people can have a regular period all the way through their pregnancy up to the very last day.. though this is more common for overweight women. If your normal size, first 3 months, yes.... 3-9 months, no.|`|ZfUCYGzLaa	iv heard of people soptting while prego but not an actualy period, thats the sheds of the lining of the uterus which is what is holding the baby so that wont be ridden of.|`|Hsyjt3wTaa	some do in fact have periods while they are pregnant. If they do which is a rare case, then they are irregular periods. This makes them believe they are not pregnant and can lead to problems with the baby at birth.|`|a70231ccec5d44c2d21f177c98496f1baa	Yes some pregnant people see their periods for the whole or part of the pregnancy. Its normal for that to happen.
n9mM979Yaa	Are you stupid?  Grow a pair and don't apologize.  Oooooh you called someone a whore.  That's a big deal... if I were 10.|`|x3EPqezJaa	You don't have to apologize. You did nothing wrong. A lot of people with self-esteem issues tend to feel like they need everyone to like them. But you don't. Some people just won't like you, and that's OK.
dFE54Nzraa	Don't ever ever think fat "turns" to muscle, or vice versa. That's like saying a duck will turn into a dog.     Your weight gain is probably from 2 things: Lean muscle gains, and/or water retention.     My suggestion is don't worry about what the scale says, track your progress by the way you look in the mirror. That's how other people will notice anyway.    Good Luck.|`|GGqh73iWaa	When you first start to exercise your muscles will became sore and when this happens the body protects the tissue, the muscle will then become inflamed and swollen with fluid retention. Its only temporary but the retention of fluid could  result in a 3- 4 pound weight gain within a few weeks. Don't worry or change what you are doing as it will level it self out.|`|YCXxP43Laa	If you are gaining muscle then your weight will increase - muscle weighs more than fat. Muscle also burns more calories than fat, even at rest, so don't worry about the weight gain, it will balance out, and you will burn fat.|`|eXAAedk1aa	The more muscle you get the heavier you get..      When you exercise too much you fat becomes muscle, do it every week (take breaks)...|`|kYYDOJzSaa	Do situps and crunches to tighten up your stomach.    Keep running (or better yet, ride a bicycle - less impact), and you should notice your weight go down, and your overall level of fitness go up.
HhmhSBpgaa	YES!!!! VERY!!!!|`|e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Yes, strep throat is contagious.  And actually can get very serious if not treated properly.  Your doctor will probably do a Quick Strep Test" which is just a a swabbing of your throat, dipped in some chemicals, and within a few minutes will come out positive or negative.  If negative, he will give you the note and you can go back to work.  If positive, he will probably give you some antibiotics.  Once the antibiotics are in your system for 24 hours, strep is usually not contagious after that, and then you can return to work.  But check with your doctor since you are going this morning.|`|ziZQWxi3aa	yes it is, how come you think they sent you home from work?  Because, they want you to get cleared by your doctor before you can goto work.    It is a bacterial infection in your throat!  Coughing can make someone catch it.|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	yes, very contagious
UOZP4Ma5aa	Try a training hospital
ufgv7oTjaa	I'm surprised nobody has answered this yet.  From my experience, the massage lotions tend to take longer to dry up than regular hand lotions... also, the hand lotions tend to have more medicating ingredients (Aloe, etc) than massage lotions. I assume it's the intended purpose that makes that reason. Personally, I think the oils are easier to work with (they last longer), but are a little harder to clean up and easier to spill, so you have to be more careful. I suppose when you're first learning to give massages, lotion would be a better learning tool.    I've heard of massage oils that tingle, but I've never used them. I'm not sure what ingredients are added for that effect, but I've seen either bottles in the store or ads on TV... I don't recall which, but I know I've seen them.    For the best massage, I would recommend to either get an instructional book or take a class on how to give massages. Or if it's between a couple, any sort of touching and rubbing will feel good... but knowing how to make it feel better generally would elicit a better response ;-)  Usually a gentle massage at first is best. Shiatsu and Swedish massages are ones you shouldn't even think about trying to give or get until you've given/had some good "normal" massages. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|DhZ67kgoaa	Massage lotion gives the massage therapist glide over your skin.  There are different kinds of lotion that provide more or less glide according to the style of massage the person does or what the intention of the massage is.    I use lotion because oil is to greasy and my clients have to go back to work usually.  Lotions are less greasy than oil.    There are oils that tingle but those are for intimate massage between partners.|`|88783c068f66446b3321905f7972cb87aa	Some questions to ask yourself and your massage partner would be:  - is dry skin a factor? - if yes, use a more emollient lotion  - are there any allergies to nut oils? - if yes, use an alternative oil like jojoba  - should the oil or lotion have a menthol or heating affect? - this would be for cases of muscle tension and fatigue when a medicated oil or cream would be used    Make sure you do a skin test on any new lotion, cream or oil by putting a small amount on a patch of skin (pick the thigh if you can). Wait a couple of hours and check it to see if it is red, irritated or has developed welts or bumps. Allergic reactions to oils or lotions applied to the entire body can mean you'll be headed in the ambulance to the ER so always do a skin test first!
x3EPqezJaa	No, that won't help. On the other hand, it's not harmful, either. Have you talked to a doctor about taking birth control pills or metformin?
xz8ftJZZaa	Well, my experience with Dentocaremed was sound - Linda was very helpful. The dentist and his assistants were so professional. After my x-ray, the dentist discussed the treatment then the work began. The whole experience was worthwhile and I felt totally at ease during my week's stay.    Mike, London.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you don't take the bc pills at the same time every day, you increase your risk of getting pregnant if you are having unprotected sex.  However, if you took the pills the same day or doubled up the next day, more than likely you are not pregnant and I would wait until the end of my pack of pills and if a period does not appear, then take a home pregnancy test.  If  you take a test, do it first thing in the morning as there are more hormones present in the first urine of the day.    best wishes..|`|Qy9nZgBhaa	If you are sexually active there is ALWAYS a chance you could be pregnant.       Why would you come and ask people you don't know if you could be pregnant.  How are we supposed to know.  Go buy a pregnancy test.|`|9OyIL8P9aa	It is possible that you could be pregnant, because you did miss your pills, or took them late. This is effect the amount of effectiveness that the pill has.   Best thing to do is go and get a home pregnancy test done such as First Response or Clear Blue. These can be taken 5 days before your expected period.   Hope this helps.
VnLaUS3Jaa	smoothies are great for health. fruits and yogurt... you can't go wrong!    for a little added nutrition, sprinkle some wheat germ or ground flaxseed along with those other ingredients.    ok, about a workout...    with the crunches, ditch the 8lb med ball. this wextra weight will only add bulk to your wasteline. double your crunch time and do only with body weight.    so you're hitting your abs. what about the mucle opposite your abs? (i'm referring to your low back.) and what about the muscles to each side of your abs? i'm now referring to your obliques. add some side bends for obliques. for your low back, lie face down on floor and lift only your upper body.     your leg workout may be ok. increase your sets or your reps each time. don't stay with the number 30.    push-ups are fine. they hit your chest and triceps.    but what about your back and your biceps?     you do a PUSH exercise for chest and bi's, but what about your back and your biceps?     PULL exercise require weights, so take grab a 10 lb (or more) dumbbell and do some bent rows. you don't want to look unproportioned and have a strong chest/triceps and weak back/biceps.    and lastly, you aren't taking care of the middle deltoids (the shoulders.)    see, when you do your push-ups, you are hitting your front delts.    when you start doing those bent rows, you will be hitting your rear delts.    do some side raises with about 5 or 10 lb dumbbells to hit your mid delts.    this will work all of you muscles.    your cardio sounds great.    your diet should be guided by the food pyramid. plain and simple. go to a web-site like mypyramid.com and study the pyramid. eat the least recommended recommended servings per group.    split your meals up into 5-6 mini meals (approx. 10 bites per serving) and eat from toddler sized bowls for portion control.    never eat 3-4 hours before bed.    hope this stuff helps.|`|ZtchMhdWaa	yess fruit smoothies are excellent for before working out. they have carbs so it should give you energy for movin your booty. your workout seems ok but i would stay step up the cardio. you should run 5 times a week. and make sure its fast and gets your heart pumping -- you need cardio for ultimate fat burn.
TX68qBfVaa	No, it doesn't.  If you truly want to know, I would recommend making an appointment with your doctor, and have yourself tested.   There's no way to know for sure just by looking.  You'd have to be tested.    Good luck! Hope this helps!|`|i8Ch743Laa	See a doctor,you can't tell yourself. It's something only a doctor can diagnose/know about.|`|DV4xyeChaa	cant tell by looking...i was tested.....wack off into a cup..then they put your boys under the microscope,,,see if they look good and swim OK|`|BrxTq9sGaa	No. you dont have anything in your semen if ur infertile
kogsyGAPaa	because your whole sinus area is connected...so when a person gets sick the whole head feels blocked up like their nose, ears, headaches, and sore throats. Try taking some nasal decongestant, that always helped me, and blow your nose some more!  Hope you feel better!
bDzshhYiaa	HI Michelle    Michelle do you do something that your mom   doesn't want you to do.but you do it anyway. the bad thing of addiction is that it's extremely hard to quit.  It doesn't take mental power it takes physical power to stop smoking. your mom knows that you love her and that you want her to quit but the only way that she's going to quit as when she besides that that's what she's going to do.I know how you feel and I grieve with you.my father was a smoker when I was a child and I remember waking up with a sore throat in the morning from smelling smoke.  my father got mouth cancer and they removed his chin  he is cancer free now thank God.  And doesn't smoke anymore.  The best advice that I can give to you would be quit nagging your mom.and go to the locals throat a nose physician asked them for brochures on smoking and what smoking can cause.  Get your couple dozen of different types and every now and then just leave one lying around somewhere.so she can find it. She will read it her mind will process better than you nagging at her.  She may throw the first few away.  That's okay just keep leaving them lay around.  Good luck sweetheart with your mission.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	Tell her that if she doesn't stop smoking, then you are going to start, and really stick to your guns on this! This always solves the problem, one way or another.|`|vn0DHMXWaa	I don't think you should try to stop your mom from smoking. People like to smoke, and it helps her with stress.    But why do you say you aren't old enough to smoke? What does that mean? If you are old enough to post intelligent questions on here, you are old enough to smoke! I have been smoking for 25 years, and I started at 7. My niece is 6 and has been smoking a long time! We are both just fine, too!|`|AA10405438	Tell her you love her and would like her to be around for a very long time an be healthy.

QYXij5Wcaa	You are on that border between ideal and overweight in terms of BMI, though still ideal.  However, it depends on other factors. Muscle weighs more than fat.|`|ac7a16ae718a21dd251655a703176688aa	You may have a little more (a tad) weight, or flab, but I doubt if you'd be overweight, if so not by much?   Let's work it out for you on the BMI scale, so you know for sure!    Body Mass Index is used to see if you are underweight, in the normal range, overweight or obese.  BMI is calculated by weight, (kilos) divided by height in metres squared.  So  yours is worked out as such:  75 / (1.78 x 1.78).    A BMI of 20 to 24.9indicates a healthy weight range.  A BMI of between 25 to 29.9, indicates overweight,  30 and above indicates obesity.    Lim you are 23.7, so nothing to worry about, you are in the healthy weight range!  Too easy!  So do a dance kiddo!  ;-)|`|rdVlcdQXaa	google bmi calculator that should tell you ^^

Go for three or four days without a ciggy and voila, cravings gone, interest gone, smell repulsive etc etc who cares about being bored its better than making yourself ill by smoking and you'll feel better for doing it.

deAyKj2Uaa	the shot doesnt do nearly the same on the skin. i would stick with yaz.  yaz is actually a very popular birth control for helping with acne.  if you get the shot, you may see an immediate change in your skin, but it may only last a short while.  since you only get it once every three months, over time youll see your skin going back to the way it was as the levels of birth control hormones lessen as the months go by before your next shot.  the pill is the best method of birth control to take to keep your skin clear.  whatever you decide... good luck! :) :)|`|60mDEusiaa	I'm on the shot now and during the last month, my skin breaks out again.

Maybe you should get a second opinion as this sounds like something more serious than just your average bacterial infection.  Maybe an STD?  My friend got a bacterial infection once and she was only on pills for a week, but she says she had to be sure to take them at the same time every day.  Are you doing that?

iXEoFY6laa	I wouldn't say it can be "cured", but you can probably learn to work through it.    Is there anyone you feel like you can talk to, someone you really trust? Try talking to them. Let them know what you're going through. Talk about the disorder, but also talk about other things. The more you talk to the person, the more comfortable and confident you will become. You'll feel like, "If I can talk to this person, I can talk to another person too." Over time, you may be able to feel more confident, more outgoing, and more able to trust people.    Good luck! I hope everything goes well for you. Remember that you're not alone, and you CAN work past this.    |`|TdqeC0vmaa	some anxiety abates with age. Once you know something more familiarly and get therapy your anxiety lessens. Otherwise there' d be no reason for therapy...wed just be screwed.    What is different about this than something like agoraphobia is that it is a personality disorder. Meaning it is you. Our personality is everything that makes us... us. When you have become someone with an AVpd that oversensitivity and monitoring the low self confidence and fear of others... the shyness to an extent that interferes with life is who we are.     No it cant be cured. but it can be treated. The goal is for us to realize what is negative in having our disorders and work to better those aspects the fullest of our capacity. Like the fact that you cant cure the common cold but you can treat the symptoms.     We can work to make ourselves live able healthier calmer more confident and fully functioning. But we will always be us.     So yes it does -can- get better. But it cant be cured. No one can wipe away a personality. But they can help someone learn to cope with themselves and the world better.    ... and boy could I use some of that therapy...|`|fLzsH3Ohaa	By this - if you mean like agoraphobia- or other such things- you need to email me.

qnD5RfbPaa	Your condition can improve if you take special care of your health.  Not many medication works well with alcohol.  Therefore if you really want to improve your condition, then you will need to abstain from alcohol.       Your diet is very important.  Include in your diet all sorts of sea foods.  Also most of your diet should be fresh raw fruits and vegetables. Have both raw and cooked vegetables.  Eat more raw vegetables than cooked ones.  Include garlic in your diet.    Supplements that help are omegas and garlic.|`|AA11635143	I saw where you had rheumatic fever as a child and that can cause progressive heart disease.  First of all, have you officially been diagnosed with angina by a doctor?  Second, blood pressure medication is to be taken EVERY day at the same time.  If it is prescribed once a day, take it once a day; If it is prescribed twice a day, take it twice a day.  Do not skip doses even when your blood pressure is normal or when you feel well.  If you have an enlarged left ventricle that could mean that you have internal heart damage or some arterial blockage; a thick endo could mean that your heart muscle has already received damage.  Checking your blood pressure will not cause heart or chest pains.  You seem very young to have such health problems although they are now being seen in younger patients even in children.      You should get yourself under the care of a good cardiologist (heart specialist) NOW and find out what is going on.  The first thing your present doctor should have done was have you take a Nuclear Stress Test and that will tell exactly what is going on with your heart.  If your doctor told you what you've said, he is a certifiable idiot.  Any doctor with a brain knows you don't treat a heart patient like he is treating you.  Nitrates (nitroglycerin) is only a temporary fix and you can still die if you have a blocked artery, which may be part of your problem.  If you do have a blockage, your heart is not getting enough oxygen and that is what is causing the pain.  YOU WILL NOT GET BETTER without some serious medical intervention and it is nothing you can delay if you want to live.  Delayed treatment for angina is the thing that adds new graves to the cemetery.    I'm laying it out as I see it because my husband came within HOURS of dying of a massive heart attack.  He was so close he lay in the emergency room for 6 hours so he could be stabilized enough for heart surgery. He was so close the doctors wouldn't even allow him to raise his head off the pillow.  He had been having angina and didn't tell me but slipped away to a doctor who only prescribed Nitroglycerin for the chest pain.  I found a receipt for payment and backed him into a corner and made him tell me what was going on.  That's when I stepped in and took over that very minute, arranged an emergency visit with a heart specialist.  He was so close to a heart attack the doctor ran out and said he wasn't sure my husband would survive the surgery.  I'm not trying to scare, you should already be scared enough to head for the emergency room now.

UnSTw2Zeaa	I had headaches like that whenever I either laughed really hard, or I got up from a bent down position. My Dr. told me I had very low blood pressure. I know how bad it hurts. It's almost like you can't move for a few minutes. Try getting your Dr. to check your blood pressure, or for dehydration, not eating enough, even anxiety judging by the problem with your chest. I am on anxiety meds. and I know when I get upset, the first two things that happen are...my chest starts to hurt, then I get a bad headache. If I don't catch it in time, I usually throw up. So I would see my PCP to narrow it down. It may be nothing, but at least you will know. Hope this helps.|`|BJuHbQXfaa	By putting something on your chest that was cold slowed down the heart, the heart pumps blood to the brain and you slowed that process down, it was a shock to the heart.  By warming you chest up again and get the blood flowing properly to the brain the pulse should stop. It is almost like eating ice cream really fast and you get a brain freeze. If it does not stop after a few minutes then I would call your doctor and seek some medical advise.

4yzxXO1haa	It sounds like your ex is quite the manipulator. You have not done anything wrong (except for the minor incident where you hit him - however, you apologised, and are genuinely sorry). The only way he "wins" is if you continue feeling like this. People who manipulate and abuse others emotionally do so to make others feel miserable. You have not mentioned anything which makes you sound like a nutcase. He probably knows that he is in the wrong, and is probably sulky because you escaped him and broke the cycle, which is why he is performing badly at work. You need to move on, and be happy. You are not a nutcase, you've just been manipulated to feel that you are.

a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Whatever you do, do NOT have radiation.    I'm assuming that you have Grave's disease. Did the doctor who offered you radiation tell you that radiation is NOT a cure for Grave's disease? Did he tell you that it makes Grave's disease worse? And did he tell you that after you have the radiation, you will not only still have Grave's disease, but you will also have an additional disease (iatrogenic hypOthyroidism)? Did he tell you that while radiation will get rid of one symptom of Grave's disease only (hyperthyroidism) that it might come back?    If your doctor didn't tell you these things, then he is not allowing you  informed consent. That is malpractice. And you should RUN away from this doctor as fast as you can, and find a new one.    The correct treatment for Grave's disease is methimizole (or PTU in the UK). You take it until your body naturally goes  into remission, or for the rest of your life, whichever comes first. There is absolutely NO cure for Grave's disease. There is only treatment. Any doctor who tells you that he can cure you is telling lies and commiting malpractice.|`|VM6XG5c3aa	Depends on which thyroid disorder you have AND what treatments have already been tried.    Hyper can be Grave's Disease, a hyper swing of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis or even a genetic disorder, like my situation.     No matter what the cause RAI is the LAST resort for treatment. Used only when nothing else works or if the body is so hyper that there is no time to go a safer route due to the ongoing damage to the body from an extreme hyper state.    RAI does not 'fix' anything. It's purpose is to destroy the thyroid gland, or part of it depending on the dose, to prevent it from producing excess thyroid hormone and causing a hyper state.     It's pretty much a given that after the RAI you won't have enough gland function left to provide your body with sufficient thyroid hormone to be able to function in a healthy manner and will end up on thyroid hormone replacement for life. That means taking hormone replacement daily... for the rest of your life.    So if you are being told that this will 'fix' your thyroid problem, that is untrue. It will merely change your thyroid problem.    Sad to say some docs prefer gland destruction and hormone replacement cuz it's easier for them than to go the other routes.    For us... loss of a gland is permanent, I lost mine to RAI nearly 20 years ago, and having to deal with doctors that are totally ignorant when it come to PROPER thyroid care can make life (I'm using family friendly wording here even though it's too mild for the emotions I have on this particular subject) a challenge to deal with.    Explore your options carefully, KNOW that you may have options, depending on which thyroid disorder you are dealing with and available treatments for it.|`|Tkp1qsXdaa	i chose low dose of meds and it's working

Any diet that promises you to lose 10 lbs in 1 week is just depleting you of water weight and actually SLOWING down your metabolism making it that much harder for you to burn calories.  Now if youre a yo-yo dieter multiply that every time you start a new diet and youre slowing down your metabolism EACH time.  No wonder you cant lose weight?!    The secret to being fit is just good old-fashioned diet and exercise.  Its a lifestyle change that only you can make.  You have to have the mind set that your body and health is worth it.  You will feel so much happier, and healthier once you make this change.  Youll be a better wife, mom, sister, husband, friend, etc.      So now that I filled you in on the big secret.  I will share some tips that I have learned in my own fitness quest.  Small, frequent meals are the most effective way to lose weight, and maintain your blood glucose levels.  If youre following a 1200 cal/day diet try to eat 300 for breakfast, 300 for lunch, 300 for dinner, and 2 snacks in between with 150 each.  You will find that you are never hungry, and never full.  Because we all know that Big Mac tastes good going down it doesnt feel so hot sitting in your belly for the next 6 hours.      You have to count your calories- at least in the beginning until you have a good grasp on the nutrition levels and portion amounts that your body needs.  There are lots of websites that can help you log your meals online to see all the nutrition totals.  I like www.myfitnesspal.com  This is a FREE site that allows you to plug in your height/weight/exercise level and will tell you how many calories you need to consume to achieve our goals.  Its personalized, its free, and it works.      Now exercise will be different for everyone and I say do something you enjoythat way you are more likely to stick with it.  A good exercise program will combine cardio and strength training.  Cardio will help you burn calories and torch body fat, while strength training will build muscle, which in turn boosts your metabolism and makes you LEAN.  Girls do not be afraid of weights; they are your best friends.  Im a busy nurse and I work long days so I personally enjoy working out at home to save time and $$.  My favorite DVD programs are Chalean extreme, Turbo Jam, P90X, and Slim in Six.  Check out www.BBfitcoach.com for details.    Make sure you make yourself accountable.

Good luck.|`|d42b54b320b9818827f38c2131f515dfaa	TRy to put it in some applesauce- it should go right down .Also- you put a pill at the back of your tongue and you put a capsule on the front of your tongue.|`|Zre1r1Yjaa	try putting the liquid in your mouth first, then putting the pill in, then taking another drink to swallow|`|CNlfn5Wraa	Put the pill in applesauce or pudding and than wash down with milk.

ZMWjdKfraa	I had been suffering really bad and discovered that I have an ulcer in the esophagus , my Doctor gave me an alkaline diet to follow and Proton pump inhibitors .After 2 months the symptoms didn't improve so I carried on with the diet but separated the food groups as in food combining like (Hay diet ).My symptoms have greatly unproved , now im going to elevate my bed head ( using too many pillows just scrunches the stomach )and make sure I don't go to bed after eating .I haven't had any alcohol for a few months and I stay away from acidic foods.Good luck hope you get better soon and remember a lot of it can be trial and error.|`|rYNM67oyaa	This diet sounds about right. If you like foods on the prohibited list I'd just start eliminating one or two at a time instead of all of them at once until the symptoms you have are alleviated. They want you to quit too many good things. I quit caffeine and smoking and peppermint candy and that was enough to alleviated it for me. Also sleeping with my head elevated. I always want to overdo it anyway.    http://www.gicare.com/Diets/GERD.aspx|`|e3b904aaa50910826d70fdd2aae617f5aa	I have had this problem and what I suggest to you is that you keep a food diary and symptom diary.  After a month or so you will start to see a pattern of what you eat and how it effects you.      The foods that affect me are white bread and tomatoes but I only found that out by keeping a food diary.    Good Luck  Kiki|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	I don't know about the foods to avoid but I can tell you foods that will HELP you:    sweet potatoes  yams  pineapples (strange, I know)  pineapple juice (the real juice, not pineapple flavored juice)  plain bagels|`|Mfxq2Ebpaa	Hi,     I have suffer like mad with these symptoms (result of my GERD & hiatus hernia).   The main things to avoid are:  1. Alcohol - im currently suffering because of this :( whats a 23 yr old to do tho. hehe..  2. Spicy Foods  3. Cheese  4. Acidic things like Tomatos, oranges etc.  5. Chocolate.  6.High fat foods  7.Fizzy Drinks.    So pretty much everything. hehe..    The things what help me are Cottage cheese, bio yogart, porridge & Bananas.     Also there is a thing you can buy from health shops called ''slippery elm tea''. the taste is not the nicest but does the trick!     Some other things that may help:  Not eating 2-3 hrs before bed.  Dont eat large meals, Have small meals often.  Prop yourself a bit higher in bed (i use 3 pillows) it helps stop the acid rising up at night. Also sleeping on your left side helps to.    Have you seen the doc about this? reflux is main symptom of hiatus hernia. Also he can prescribe you some thing for it. ie.omeprosole, gavescone.
ipklKqrWaa	Bad idea.|`|AA12324049	While I agree that you can't eat cookies all your life, I am a fan of the cookie diet for getting off the weight.  I have been on it for two weeks now and I have lost 8.5 lbs.  The reason I like it is because I'm in my car a lot for my job and it is difficult for me to transport special meals with me or find them on the road.  I find it very easy to stick to and I work out everyday.  I know how to eat healthy so I'm not worried that after I reach my goal I will have any trouble eating regular food vs. the cookies.  Another reason I really like this program is that they test your thyroid - many of us have problems with our thyroid that have gone undiagnosed because our levels appear to be in the correct range.  But everyone is an individual and what is a right range for one person may not be right for another.  I knew I was one of these people because I had a lot of the symptoms of an underactive thyroid.  Now that I am on the thyroid meds, I feel tons better!|`|pjYQhPPBaa	No way. It's a hoax like every other fad diet out there. I don't know what exactly is in the cookie, but I do know that you lose weight simply because that's all you eat. If you eat 6 cookies a day, you're limiting yourself calories. Plus, the only meal you're allowed to have on this "diet" still has to be healthy, filled with lean protein and vegetables. If you have to eat healthily while on this cookie, why not eat healthily off the cookie?    Excess calories make you gain weight; negative calories make you lose weight. But just because you're eating     The best way to lose weight AND KEEP IT OFF is to just eat a proper, healthy diet and exercise at least 30 minutes, 3-4 days per week.|`|2vWSbAddaa	it works fantasticly i lost 84 pounds doing it.
NDhC2PNGaa	im a bit worried about this question, my friend mum had this and it made her very weak, she had fallen over one day and banged her head and ended up in a coma, she died 4 months latter, sorry i had to tell you this, please eat dont make your self ill, good luck|`|5df269977f7c0720cf1bea0e2305a94faa	depends, you can lose about a stone in 2 weeks, depending how much you weigh at the beginning, but this is not advised though|`|MLpfzoexaa	I am bulimic as well, and I've discovered that you actually lose weight faster by eating small fat free snacks to curb your hunger, and only binging/purging when you just can't help it.     By taking in a certain amount of calories, you have more energy, and burn more fat. If you purge everything, your body goes into starvation mode, which causes your body to store fat and just makes you sick and miserable.

Another possiblity is to call your local Mental Health Mental Retardation center, and see if they will treat you.
e3b904aaa50910826d70fdd2aae617f5aa	Hi there, I was also in an emotionally abusive relationship for 4 years and I undestand exactly how you feel.  However, you are already over the most difficult bit, and that is, accepting that what you were going through was emotional abuse and not anything that you could have done something about.  I'm pleased to see you saying that you are pretty and have a lot going for you beacause that means he hasn't beaten you down.  I'm sorry there is no great advice to give you because it takes time.  You still have to get over the fact that someone you loved did this to you and there was nothing you could do.  One thing I will say is that once you have experienced this it is very unlikely that you will put yourself through this again because you will be tuned into 'emotional abusers'.  In  fact, the whole experience finally made me stronger because now no-one can tell me it is my fault when I know it is not.  Hang in there girl, forget about this guy as much as you can and go out there and look for love again-  I am sure you will find it.|`|qIcWac3Yaa	Hi,    Good job for getting away.  Understand that his negative definitions of you were a kind of brainwashing.  If he had been able to brainwash you into believing that you really were a bad, average-looking, waste-of-space, dumb person, then you wouldn't have had the strength to get away.  That's what it's all about -- control.    There are quite a few books on the subject of emotional abuse, such as the following one (which I just recommended to someone else): http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/15585...    I'm recommending it to you because, even though you have a healthy understanding that it was emotional abuse, you seem to be asking about how to deal with it, and these books really do help in that respect (i.e., how you should feel about it, how you can avoid anything like that ever happening again, etc.).|`|6MRcqskIaa	It is probably best you see a domestic violence counsellor. They would have to time to go through all your questions. There is so much to explain it would take time and I don't have time to answer the whole question. Firstly though I would like to say. All domestic violence (perpetrators) men are charming to begin with that is how they work. Seriously look objectively at the situation. You defiantly wouldn't have fallen in love with a person who hit you in the beginning (before you got emotionally tied down). All perpetrators attempt to get the women/man emotionally involved to begin with, so that it is harder for you too leave. So please please stop blaming yourself the perpetrator had seek you out and planned the whole situation.   It isn't you. A good article to red for future reference is "how to identify a perpetrator". this will help to identify perpetrators early in the relationship before you get emotionally tied.|`|9hANb2mdaa	No one can ever have a hold over you, no one.    You made the decision to be and stay with him and go through with the abuse. How can he force your own body to do something against its will, he does nt have that power.    The problem is that the hold comes from when you have sex with him. Scientists can show you that physically when his body fluids come into yours and vice versa you become automatically cpr ovened. Its a proven fact.    You will have to break your self off. Its your choice completely.    If you want to you ask Jesus to do it and give your life to Him. God has more power to help you than your boyfriend.

VnLaUS3Jaa	start off with compound leg exercises such as squats and lunges (front, reverse and walking lunges)     when doing lunges, stand with feet together and step out and immediately sink down towards the ground keeping your knee behind the toes.     the further you step out during a lunge, the more your are going to hit your glutes.     isolate the glutes by doing:    DONKEY KICKS:     ~ get down on hands and knees.  ~ keep your torso in a straight line (don't arch or round the back)  ~ keeping one knee on ground, keep other knee bent and raise towards the ceiling.  ~ as you raise the leg, you want to:  a) drive through the heel, as if you were trying to drive your hill through the ceiling.  b) stop when your upper leg is parallel to the ground   c) squeeze the glutes (butt) muscles for 2 (or more) counts  d) still squeezing, slowly lower the leg back to starting position. the slower and more controlled, the better. don't let the leg just fall back to he ground.    BRIDGES:    ~ lie on your back with both knees bent and arms to side.  ~ raise your butt up off the ground until your body looks like a ram from your knees to your chest (meaning you want your upper legs and torso to be in a straight line)  ~ hold and squeeze glutes for 2 (or more) counts  ~ still squeezing the glutes, slowly lower back to starting position, making sure not to let the butt just fall back to the ground. again, the slower, the better.    these are great *** boosting exercises.     start out with 20 reps of each and always increase one or all of the following:     ~ 2-5 more reps each time you workout,   ~ an additional set each time you work out,   ~ add weight (ankle weights or dumbbells), or  ~ add another day of the week    hope these help you.|`|rCfHQ2oXaa	pick it up for goodness sakes.

f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	What do you mean he has an asthma attack?  A child having an attack means their airways close and they cant breath.     Do you not have puffers for him?  He is obviously not controlled properly and that means either he doesn't have the right puffers, he may been to be on pills rather than puffers, or you simply are not administering his medications correctly and thus they are not effectively working to control his asthma.    Get educated, get your kid to the doctor, and I hope you have had him tested for allergies and that no one smokes around him and that he isn't around mold or dust or strong chemicals, cooking fumes, etc. etc. etc.    If asthma goes uncontolled it will scar the lungs eventually and at some point as an adult if not sooner the person will develop emphysema from the scarring and it's just downhill from there.  Take this disease seriously it is life threatening to someone that sick.    The machine the person is referring to is called a nebulizer.    Its quite possibly the doctor (PEDIATRICIAN or lung specialist) will recommend it to you once your child is properly assessed.    This delivers his meds slowly with oxygen, so it gets deep into his lungs and airways.  Those airways are inflammed and blocked with mucus and tight, which is why he coughs to get the mucus OUT.      When he cant get it out is when he has an attack. His airways can close right up and he can even die if it gets really bad which is why I say dont take it lightly.    You have to learn to manage it and much is avoidance of what triggers it and proper administration of meds so they get DEEP into the lungs where they need to go.    Most kids, the stuff doesn't get past their throat.  I hope you have an aerochamber and if you do and it's not enough you should get the nebulizer and give him his meds that way.    There are drugs but make that the last route you go as they work with a different mechanism than the puffers which are more safe and if effective the preference.    Ventolin if you have it should be given when he is in distress.  When he is in such distress as you mentioned you should get him to the ER where they can help him immediately.  That is really what you should do to get the ball going in the right direction.  They can point you where to go from there.|`|hQIqEnTEaa	You need to see your GP for this.

When she would develop a cold it would always turn into a cough. The cough would then develop into a horrible coughing fit that would include her struggling to catch her breath, her eyes would tear and then sometimes she would cough so hard she would vomit.     The doctor will have to prescribe medication for these attacks. My daughter was put on Albuterol breathing treatments. It will help, but usually will take up to 2 days for the full effect of easing the childs airways.     There is no remedy, they will have to grow out of it. But when an attack occurs you can turn on the shower and fill the bathroom with steam, this can help. You will need to get with the doctor for medication and other suggestions of how to help your son.
LnJjgxMPaa	First of all, stop thinking of it as a diet.  I've lost about 40 lbs. in the past few years and I still struggle sometimes.  I decided to exercise almost daily, drink mostly water, and change the way I think about food.  I made an effort to slowly cut back on the fast food and grease at home until I didn't crave it anymore.  I also decided to start eating smaller portions, especially on my "cheat" days where I splurge on something fatty and/or sweet.  It really is a lifestyle change rather than a diet.  A "diet" is too restrictive and you feel like you're denying yourself and so it's hard to stay on the wagon so to speak.  But if you change your attitude about food, it makes it a lot easier.  It's okay to have cake, ice cream, and fries every now and again, but it shouldn't be a regular thing.      Keeping a food journal and tracking your progress also makes it easier to make wise food choices.  You can also find yummy recipes online and substitute low-fat ingredients for the fatty ones if you're bored with the healthy diet.  Once you start making progress and seeing results, it's a lot easier to maintain.|`|PeyJ1NiNaa	Just dont 'Diet' if your contantly thinking oh god what should i eat to keep my diet you automaticly start thinking about the foods u cant eat leading to cravings and giving in.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	There are girls born with such a tiny hole in their hymen that it is very difficult to locate the entrance to the vagina.  If she is having vaginal discharge and periods then there is a hole present from which fluids are escaping the vagina and uterus.  The best thing she can do is get a mirror and take a look down there and locate her vagina, which is between the small urethra (where we pee from) and the anus (where we poop from).  If she has only a very tiny hole or many tiny holes she may need to see a doctor to numb the area and surgically remove the hymen to expose the entrance to the vagina.    hope this helps..|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	It's actually quite common that your hymen can cover your vagina (your hymen is actually on the outside, not many people know), but USUALLY they will check for it at birth. If she has a period, then it will not be completely covered, it might just be small.   I know you can't look but it's possible that since she can't really see INTO it she thinks she doesn't have it... it does kind of close up when your not... using it...   It kind of sounds like she's much too young, she will have to find it herself first....   She might have to go to the doctor, some people ACTUALLY have to get their hymen cut becuase it prevents sex or a period... but she should know about this if she has it, and it was likely done at birth.   So, doctor, or look for it herself.   If she doesn't know Her OWN body well enough, she's not ready for sex. She needs to get a mirror and learn her own body. Poking and prodding yourself isn't gonna cause any damage.     Good luck!|`|x3EPqezJaa	Not having a vagina is a rare birth defect. So it's possible, but it's more likely that she's just clueless.

"Fluid" can be anything, get details and keep asking until you are satisfied that you understand.|`|MNja3iwMaa	sounds like a hernia. my son had the same problem and his testicle got stranguated and he lost it. the hospital can do a simple examination of shining a torch on the inflamed testicle and it will let them see if there is a strangulation. the first hospital visit we had they didn't know what it as unti li suggested could it be a hernia! don't take any chances.|`|TdIbrGYYaa	I'd be worried too.  You simply need more information around what is happening.  Oh and based off experience, I would go back to another doctor.  Don't take him to the same place.  Take him elsewhere and get a second opinion.  If the the opinions don't match, take him to one more and see if you can butt up two to one.  From there, ask as much as you can to make certain that you understand everything that is going on.  You may need to have to explain it to him one day so you are gonna want to make certain you can.  There is nothing wrong with asking.  I would most definitely not over look this.  Could be a hernia, clogged testicle, fluid as they say just doesn't sound like a broad enough answer.|`|117d78fffc0d4a818e49820e1513275baa	It sounds like it could be a hydrocoele - which is indeed due to fluid in the sac. That's quite common and fairly easy to diagnose and does indeed usually sort itself out in good time. If you need more reassurance and explanation then your GP is the person to see (though having sent you to A&E to get diagnosed he wouldn't inspire me with confidence!). Perhaps you could see someone else in the practice to get a proper explanation.|`|7Tq7EbFnaa	if your not satisfied (i wouldn't be) go back to your doctor and insist on seeing a paediatrician, or get in touch with your health visitor and see what she comes up with.

AA10079027	I would use advil (the real thing as many dentists have told me that is the best) for soreness and aching. Your next door teeth were traumatized a bit between the Novocaine and your nerves and tissues around the decayed teeth being filled.  If it doesn't feel better after a couple of days I would try warm salt rinses and then call your dentist if none of this helps.  I hope you feel better soon.

5vqo3XzHaa	Hi "WenWen"!  I am including a link to a site which will give you information on this drug.  Here is a part of what the article says:    "When it comes to seeing results, everyone is different. Some peoples symptoms begin to improve as soon as the first week that they take DETROL LA. Most patients continue to improve as they take DETROL LA for several months. So, if you just started taking DETROL LA, be sure to give it a full chance to work. Also make sure to keep taking DETROL LA for as long as your doctor prescribes. If you stop taking DETROL LA, your symptoms may return."    I sure will be praying the medicine starts taking effect real soon!  Love you!!!   :)

acOzcA9Oaa	Hi, I'm currently taking Ativan(Lorazepam), and I have in the past taken Cymbalta. Most antidepressants take about 30 days to build up in your system. So you won't be getting any effects from the cymbalta until the end of next month. As for the Ativan, well that depends. I take 1.5 mgs of Ativan at a time (my panic attacks are always triggered, they aren't random like most people's are). I get severe panics, that why I take that high of dose. Are your attacks triggered or random? Ativan goes into your blood stream about 20 minutes after you take it.

NbWFJjvraa	OMG!  Hasn't your technician/clinic given you a prescription for a numbing cream???  I'm nearly finished with my series of treatments for full bikini and legs.    My first treatment, I decided, "Geez, I'm tough, I'm not going to fill that prescription."  I nearly bit through my lips, cheeks and tongue!!!  Needless to say, I used two tubes of lidocaine cream the next time.    Talk to your clinic and tell them you need the cream.  It is applied about an hour before treatment and then you have to wrap the area in Saran Wrap.  I know it sounds weird, but, trust me, it's worth it.    Good luck!|`|rgNP0Qo6aa	The clinic can prescribe the cream  But my nurse who does my treatments told me she has a few people pop a couple vicodin before hand. A LOT of people take aleve (it can't hurt) And she said one person brought a flask with them and excused themselves several times during the procedure to have a sip. Is it illigel? YES! Did it work... probably. I don't know... I just try to suck it up  It hurts less and less each time because you have less hair so if nothing works just hang in there!    Okay... science answer:    You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.    Okay... Personal Experience:    I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:  Bikini-$750  Underarms-$750  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500    Email me if you have any more questions about it!|`|x3EPqezJaa	Take some advil before the procedure.
YTbUryGoaa	Actually the clear liquid could have been a symptom of the UC. I wish I knew more about your situation, ie: exactly how you were diagnosed... colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, if a biopsy was taken during either and tested....etc. In my experience when I am starting to flare up I will feel the urge to pass gas and when I do it's not gas but instead a liquid, sometimes clear, sometimes blood tinged, sometimes brown tinged and it has a distinct UC smell... only people with UC can truly describe this smell, it's really horrible. And it's a tell-tale symptom of a flare... along with other symptoms that sometimes progress slowly... ie: blood when you wipe, constipation, pressure, bloating, small mucus/pus releases in your stool... as the flare increases your symptoms become more urgent, panful, you will start to feel a strong pressure to go and then realize there's no bowel to release or you will go and there will be blood diarrhea. The more "urges" you have a day, the worst the classification is. When you get to this point, without medication you will increasingly get worse until you're hospitalized. My suggestion is to monitor your clear liquid you mention, monitor all bowel movements and if you don't have a Gastro-Specialist (GI), then you need one, you should be on maintenance drugs to keep UC in remission unless you're flaring and then you should be on medication to control it. This is a very embarrasing disease and I suggest looking into joining a forum specifically for it, as you will find more than enough support and guidance to help you understand what your body is going through.|`|fj31ZjrVaa	What ever it was, it wasn't related to ulcerative colitis.

x3EPqezJaa	No. They have different types of synthetic progesterone. The type in Depo-Provera is "medroxyprogesterone acetate". The type in Mirena is "Levonorgestrel". Each has slightly different effects on the body, and thus slightly different side effects.     More importantly, they are delivered differently to the body, which causes dramatically different effects. Depo-Provera is delivered via injection, and is absorbed throughout the body, and affects the functioning of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries. It likewise affects the body's production of GnRH, FSH, LH, progesterone, and estradiol. Mirena is placed in the uterus and delivers hormones locally only, so only the uterus is affected by the hormones, and there is virtually no systemic impact.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	Yes

Instead of drying with a towell, Slightly dab it.    Do this once a day for about a week and your excema should heal and be less irritating.    Have a nice day and don't pee on your hand silly!|`|AA10251806	never heard of that, doubt it would work|`|4oEuCkjPaa	of course I od it all the time|`|HxlRHy3Daa	yeah i got eczema that sounds pretty retarded generally if its open wounds (all red and blotchy) you want to keep chemicals lik soaps and piss away from it hah i think he is trying to put you in pain  id reccomend e45 if it gets bad its a cream that basically stops it getting flaky and itchy|`|mTXHW3lzaa	I've never heard of that as a solution. Your probably better off going to the doctor to get a medicated ointment.|`|DkjCyBMwaa	you could try it but it probably wont work. you do know that they have special lotions and stuff for that, right?|`|0PkFuZMwaa	back in the days older people say that pee helps clear acne and excema.i'm from the pld school myself and those things do work.|`|67jA9Wb7aa	I have excema or however you spell it and i will tell you that urea will only dry it out. Try cortisone cream or e45|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Don't bother with that. Go to the dollar store or Walmart and buy a tube of cortisone cream 1%. It will cost about $2 and work much better for your eczema than peeing on it.  And jelly fish stings are much better cured with some vinegar poured over them. Always take a small bottle to the beach with you just in case.|`|lVMltZEraa	Definately    It will actually cure it completely.|`|1d46c91420d8e5a61d64f44e91ba4c9eaa	go 2 the doctor and they will give you some skin cream. you have to do it fast because if you don't take care of it early ,it will get worst.|`|4XtRFTMUaa	I also doubt this would work.  My son had eczema when he was a baby and we used Aquaphor or Eucerin lotion.  HTH    Also sometimes it will flare up due to certain things you eat so you may want to keep an eye on it and see if eating certain foods seems to make it worse.|`|QJF4QP4raa	I doubt peeing on your hand would do any good. There is something though in pee that is good for disinfecting a sore, like if you are on a hike or something.    I have always had problems with my hands. For me it   is too much water, harsh (everyday) liquid hand soaps, and of course chemicals. I have to wear gloves when cleaning house and washing dishes, and when I don't I pay for it.   Most lotions don't even help, they might temporarily but not not for long.  Vaseline is soothing at night with cotton gloves or socks but it doesn't cure the problem for me.  I'm suffering from it right now thanks to the added problem of a dry winter (high humidity in summer is my friend) and I have been trying new things and searching on the internet.  I would suggest that you do a search and look up olive oil (liquid) soap. In the future I am am going to look into buying some. Right now I started rubbing olive oil on my hands every single time I washed them. Rub it on and then rinse the excess off. I could see improvement in one day.  Another thing to do is exfoliate with olive oil (I even used liquid lecithin a couple times) and either table salt or sugar and rinse.    Another good thing: soak in a warm bath with either olive oil or baby oil.   Also do a search on vinegar. I did this moning and several sights say to put some in your bath water. I am going to try that. Maybe the two together would be good.  I hope I helped you some. I am tired of having sore cracked hands myself.    I included a few links for you to look at for starters but I suggest that you look up vinegar, honey and olive oil for dry cracked hands.

q9i5f0rXaa	There are a lot of misconceptions and flat-out lies that are spread about steroid use.  People don't seem to have a problem if a doctor prescribes steroids, but if someone uses them on their own, they're suddenly "gonna die" or whatever.  I mean, birth control is a steroid, but you don't see all kinds of ads about that.  However, let me be clear, there are definite consequences, and most people that take AAS don't understand those consequences and are simply not informed enough to make smart decisions.  Your brother is probably in that position.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do.  It's ultimately his decision....but at this point, he's probably become desensitized by the rampant anti-steroid campaign that he won't listen to those arguments any more.  That's the real tragedy here.
XLXncQu9aa	She might be allergic.  Bee stings can be deadly especially if you are allergic to them.  The best thing to do is pray that she will be ok.  The only concern is that she waited too long to go to the hospital.  I think the question to ask is, if she is allergic.  Now you said it was her first bee sting.  From what you have said she sounds like she is allergic.  Now that she is in the hospital, you need to pray, go see her if you can and hope for the best.  In my mind, I think she will be fine especially if the doctors know what they are doing.  Usually anti-septics and plenty of iv will help to keep the symptoms down.|`|0KaadzHzaa	Your friend had what is called an anaphylactic allergic reaction. If she made it to the point where she is in the hospital she will be okay. Death from these type incidents is caused by the patient's airway swelling shut. If your friend made it to the point where she is now okay at the hospital. Then she will be okay.|`|jt4PVBKkaa	she is probably alergic to the bee sting|`|4BoteYDwaa	It sounds like she just had an allergic reaction. What they will likely do is inject her with an epi-pen, which will counter-act the allergy. She should be ok.
UTak66q0aa	Anaphylaxis is an acute systemic (multi-system) and severe Type I Hypersensitivity allergic reaction in humans. Anaphylaxis is dangerous but if it is treated quickly enough and with the right medical attention she should be fine.     Most likely the doctor will prescribe an Epi Pen.   Auto-Injectors are indicated for emergency treatment of allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) for people with a history of an anaphylactic reaction. Epi Pen buys the person some time if she goes into Anaphylaxis shock.   It buys her some time till medical help can get there.   She should carry it on her all the time.     Anyone with her should learn how to use and epi pen. It will save her life.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	should be ok bit will have to carry medicine with them in case of another sting|`|d11ac1603c7e53d874cecaa7631b2aa0aa	Hello, she went into anaphlatic shock.Everyone's outcome is different.

zkeu2ifyaa	Haha, psychedelics are my favorite!!!    Weed, of course is a mild hallucinogen.  Whenever I smoke it, I first feel really relaxed, kinda sleepy, and very hungry.  If I smoke a bit too much I get really really paranoid, and have anxiety attacks, so I have to be really careful when I smoke.  My heart rate has gotten up to +140 bpm...  That's not that good lol    Salvia, once.  Hated it.  Felt like I was in a bubble.  It tasted horrible too.    LSA, which is in plant seeds, such as morning glory seeds, is a milder psychedelic than LSD.  I have tripped on LSA once.  Didn't really like it.  Saw a soda can turn into a lizard.  It was kinda weird, and felt natural.    At a local music festival I tripped on shrooms for the first time.  It made all the colors look so intense.  Shrooms are a lot more earthy than LSD.  They have a lower chance of becoming a bad trip.  Shrooms are probably the best psychedelic that is common.     LSD.  My favorite that I can get often.  I've only had one bad trip.  It wasn't that bad, and when it is good, it is amazing.  There is no words to describe a LSD trip.  You can be curled up in a ball, questioning reality, and it not seem bad.    Even though LSD is the one I like that I can get, I tried something last night that was so amazingly intense.  DMT.  Your body makes this naturally during birth, death, and near death experiences.  I mixed it with just a bit of weed, took two hits, and tripped harder than I had ever had in my life.  It was very intense, and started immediately.  it was freakin awesome.    And pure MDMA.  Hard to find, exquisite effects.|`|mppB9ebgaa	Shrrrroooommmmsss.

cE9QIMNiaa	i do... its extremely uncomfortable for me.  It gets affected mostly when i'm driving and its cold outside...i'll experience the same sypmtoms as frostbite in my fingers.  They will ache and turn completely white as if all the blood vessels have constricted and then the only way i can get blood back to the ends of my fingers is to suck on them so it provides warmth from my body as well as pull blood to the tips and get it flowing again.  I'll have episodes at home on occasion as well, and thats when my hands will just be cold and they will turn a gray-ish purple (almost black) and i'll have to put gloves on...and i keep socks on my feet at all times cuz they are always cold!!!!
jCQXXPHWaa	did you close it on a joint (where the finger bends) or on the bone (in between the joints)    Can you move the finger?  Is it numb or tingly? Does it hurt if you tap it lightly on a table? (seriously just try it)    These are important to understand how severely you damaged it.    In general, motrin is good for the pain and swelling but you should also ice it every hour for 20 min's for the next 2-3 days and hold it up so the swelling will drain out into the hand.  Pain should go away as the swelling goes down.  If  it's not better in a week, I would get an x-ray.    Good luck|`|pCNt1hBbaa	if it feels numb and its throbbing chances are its broken or dislocated|`|fjR6elXVaa	do x-ray!

Your body therefore usually remains the same throughout your life.. so if you were a skinny child your more likely to stay the same as your body tries to remain that way.. its programmed to maintain whatever weight it should be.   To put on weight wont be too difficult.. All you need to do is increase your calorie intake and decrease exercise although this isn't exactly healthy.. But then if you just add more fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates then you should slowly increase in weight.. try to be healthy about it!

YQ9YXcEkaa	Quoted from the NIH website's handout on RA:    "Scientists estimate that about 1.3 million people, or about 0.6 percent of the U.S. adult population, have rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, some recent studies have suggested that although the number of new cases of rheumatoid arthritis for older people is increasing, the overall number of new cases may actually be going down.  Rheumatoid arthritis occurs in all races and ethnic groups. Although the disease often begins in middle age and occurs with increased frequency in older people, children and young adults also develop it. Like some other forms of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis occurs much more frequently in women than in men. About two to three times as many women as men have the disease."    The juvenile form of RA is more common in Caucasian children, however.    Hope that helps.
AA11992723	Take Zinc. I'd swear by it. Just make sure you have a little something in your stomach or for some people zinc causes nausea.

37433c6ac47d0b92b72607c07f65afc1aa	Depends on what causes the snoring.  As someone pointed out snooring is usually caused by OSA, Obstructive Sleep Apnea.  This is most likely caused by when you fall asleep the tounge falls back into your airway.  This causes on obstructen in the airway.  Thus when you breath the tounge, or the other tissues that are blocking the airway vibrate thus causing the snoring noise.    While some methods are used to help alleviate this.  Most of the methods that have been tired, like sleep strips and the like are not really curing the problem.  The best thing to do is to go get a sleep study and see if this is actually sleep apnea and a C-Pap can be prescribed by a doctor.    This C-Pap provides a continous positive airway and this positive pressure keeps all the soft tissues out of the way and stops the snoring and the sleep apnea.  Sleep apnea is more than jsut snoring though.  It is when you stop breathing for a couple of seconds untill your body wakes you up enough to breath again.  Most people don't realize that they do wake up, but they do.  Also do to the stop breathing the blood 02 levels drop and morning headaches and drowsy feelings in the morning are common.  Anything from narcolepsy, heart valve damage, heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and even car wrecks have been tied to Sleep Apnea......    Also you well feel TONS better with a good night sleep...     I do have sleep apnea and I wear a C-Pap at night. Not romantic but I do feel so much better when I wear one to sleep.|`|AA12348388	directly - no  but in the case of obstructive sleep apnea - you will be at risk of pulmonary hypertension or just hypertension itself, and respiratory failure eventually - so your expected lifespan will be much shorter than a normal individual

oojO4WAraa	That is pretty normal from antibiotics.  They kill the friendly bacteria in your intestines (along with the bad bacteria that is making you sick) and that gives you diarrhea.  The best thing to do is to eat a carton of yogurt every day you are on antibiotics.  The yogurt replenishes the good bacteria and prevents the diarrhea and yeast infections associate with antibiotic use.|`|OT8TMTOHaa	Antibiotics hate me.  Especially penicillin  I just try and avoid them and only take them if it is the last option|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Maybe your my sister. I can hardly take any antibiotic without getting sick.

So if he gets super sick and needs some (luckily not often) he has to have very strong ones to kill off the bug. He gets stomach cramps, spasms and he feels "right" after a few days on them. His infection goes away, but when he stops taking them he usually gets ill with every cold and flu because the antibiotics have taken the good and bad bacteria away at once. While the drugs have their place, it is definitely something that needs to be weighed up if they are necessary in your case. You can end up with yeast infections and being lactose intolerant for a few weeks after having antibiotics.

In school, they say "Drugs are bad.  If you do drugs, you're bad.  So you shouldn't do drugs.  Cause that'd be bad.  Mmkay"    Here, people say "drugs are both good and bad, depending on these various variables and can have these effects and these effects but not these effects so analyze the risks before you try anything, it is your choice, and it may or may not be right for you ... you decide."      And yeah, there should be a drugs section on here too, but because there is such a stigma attached to drug use, thanks to government propaganda, teaching misinformation about drugs in public schools, and a media that jumps all over anything "pro-drug," there will never be a Drugs section on Y!A.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	yes it piss me off|`|tI7QP3dkaa	This pisses me off to.

fMBREYmNaa	18 under you need parental consent, some surgeon may reject you if you havent finished growing|`|KppM3VzAaa	Don't look for the easy way out.  Sticky to the correct siet plan will lose you weight.  You've stuck to the correct weight gaining plan!!    You don't want to lose weight too fast, 1kg / week is a good way. To be shaping up and slimming down you need to reduce your body fat and tone your muscle. Going to the gym and eating correctly will do this.    Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day and do exercise too.     You need to be having simple carbs (fruit smoothie, banana etc) before going to the gym to kick start the fat burning process, then a protein shake within 30 mins after finishing|`|Uk9dMYg7aa	stop leeching the country because you're too lazy to work out.  youre only 14 itll drop off eventually, geez
bhyVC2mtaa	dove facial cleaser for sensitive skin.  it is amazing.  i'm allergic to acnefree, harsh chemicals, anything "exfoliating", asprin, trees, grass etc..  lol so this acually works|`|0Q7hnUUoaa	Neutrogena is the best face wash out there.  Try the dermatologist recommended for sensitive skin, you can buy that in stores.  The face wash with beads aren't that good for your skin, it tears up your skin - try to stay away from that (unless recommended by your Derm.)  Sure, you can see a dermatologist.  That might be good to do and ask him/her about the Neutrogena.  If you wear make up, try using the powder kind and apply with a brush and not a pad.  So it doesn't smush in your pores, instead it will lay gently on top of your skin.  Or try not wearing make up, both suggestions should help your skin.  If you have any more questions please free to ask.  = )    Good Luck!

Pms sux i know...  just try to keep it together!  pamper your self :] it helps i promise  god bless |`|MoNePl6naa	Many women pms before or during their period. The different balance of hormones that occurs leading up to and during your period can make you emotional. Being stressed already doesn't help. I find it helpful to prioritize what you need to get accomplished for the day. Complete tasks that you have to do early in the day, so you are sure they will get done....like studying for your test.     Eating ice cream and other comfort foods sparingly can definitely help you relax, but try not to emotionally eat. Surrounding yourself in a productive environment with other people who need to study/concentrate could help. Try to relax, you'll be fine.
0a90d49fdcb9c952d9e58e3658fa92b6aa	Probably just muscle strain.
ZtchMhdWaa	a lot of reps and low weights don't build muscle. they help shape the muscle you already have - and help strengthen it. if you're actually looking to build a little - high weights and low reps help put on bulk. once you've bulked you can turn to low weights, high reps to shape what you gained. if you just want to tone and strengthen the muscles you have than you can stick to the low weights, high reps.|`|SDaJkLMfaa	As long as you feel muscle aches after exercise, muscle mass will build up. If you don't work your muscles to their limit, you will never get bigger muscles.

I don't know why the person said not to use Benedryl cream because I used that when I had it and it worked fine. Its got antihistamine in it to prevent the spreading of it. Also when you go to the doctor you might inquire about the pill they give that prevents the urge to itch/scratch the affected areas further spreading it.     Good luck!

America is getting fatter almost everyday. A lot of people do see loosing weight to be a major crack down, but who knows. It is the ultimate life changing decision you will ever have in your life.  Exercise is important since physical activities are the most important way of burning that stubborn. Remember, loosing weight does not mean starving. Starving is not the best way of loosing weight. It will add insult to injury because starving is never a healthy option to include in your diet plan.   What you need to do is decrease the portion size of your food. Try eating on a saucer and not on a plate. This will make you avoid piling food on the saucer as much as you do when you are eating on a plate.     A wonder fruit from the Amazon is now gaining popularity among health buffs.  There is a breakthrough product of which a lot of people who desire to have a healthier body can benefit much from.

Else you can contact me on pritish_yoga@yahoo.com|`|X9QOHRLFaa	hi i am sorry but the truth is the only way to effectively and permanently loose weight is by working out and eating right , well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.    www.xattack.in
DV4xyeChaa	1 its easier to keep weight off than to lose it  2 any exercise better than none  3 key is habit,,,exercise 3/4 times a week...  4 eat know carb/calories items as much as u can [i eat same 1 piece bread/peanetbutter every day or same bowl of cereal...250/300 calories]  5 dont give up  even when you screw up...every day is new..  6 good luck|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	eat smaller meals at regular times.|`|aW59AbDaaa	My experience is that going out and buying exercise equipment, such as the treadmill you plan to buy, is a complete waste of money.  The underlying problem, I suspect, is that the person buying the treadmill is secretly hoping that buying some expensive equipment will provide the motivation to start exercising that was missing before.  It may actually work for a short time, but eventually the memory of all the money you've spent fades away and you go back to your former habits of just not finding the time or motivation to fit exercise into a busy schedule.    I would say that what you need instead of a treadmill is to rearrange your priorities so that, at an agreed upon time every day, you have absolutely nothing in your life that's more important than exercise.  Forget the treadmill and simply go outside and walk for half an hour or 45 minutes.  That will be as good exercise as what you would get on a treadmill, and the fresh air and change of scenery make walking much less boring than the same amount of time on a treadmill.  Once you get in the habit of regular daily exercise, you may want to add more vigorous workouts to your routine.  But the absolute, number one essential is to make it part of your daily routine.

o9qWYVA9aa	I think you may have strep throat.  If you haven't already, get to a mirror and point a flashlight down your throat.  Look for little white spots on the back of your throat.  Strep is also characterized by an upset stomach because of the excess swallowing.  Strep generally requires a doctor's visit, but not hospitalization.    Could be bronchitis, or allergies.  Is your voice deeper than usual?  Sometimes you just have to weather that one.  There are some allergy meds, but you just have to try those.    Asthma is a more serious possibility.  Coughing is a telltale sign of asthma combined with shortness of breath.  Asthma is a condition where the air passages get smaller.  You will hear lots of wheezing, high pitched squeaks coming mostly on inhaling.  It's aggravated by exercise and sudden shifts in temperature like a warm house to the cold outside.  This should not be ignored because it can kill you if it's bad enough.  But a trip to the doctor can give you interventions that will keep you out of the hospital and away from big bills.|`|eY005pu8aa	Sounds like it could be an allergy or maybe there is some kind of nasty pollen or other particulate near you. Or you could be dry. Try steaming up the bathroom and sitting in there for a while. But see a doc at a neighborhood clinic or something at least.

PGkR813Jaa	Yes you have thrush.    An unfortunate thing about antibiotics is they kill good and bad bacteria in all of the body.  Not just a specific place.    That is why antibiotics cause thrush so easily.  The vagina needs to have the correct balance of flora and bacteria in it at all times. When out of whack it causes thrush.    You can obtain Canastan cream. Or Oralstat tablets over the counter at the chemist.    Also try to eat some yogurt while treating yourself for thrush as this contains bacteria that are good for a healthy vagina.|`|O57Ky6D0aa	Yes antibiotics do cause thrush, the reason being it kills not only the bad bacteria in your stomach but also the good. The good bacteria keeps what is called candida albicans at a safe level. When the good bacteria isn't there to keep the candida albicans in check it grows out of control and then one get symptoms such a thrush, athlete's foot etc. You can treat the thrush with natural anti-fungals or get something such as fluconzale from the chemist. Next time your on antibiotics take a probiotic which is good bacteria to replenice what the antibiotic has destroyed and I also advise you take a probiotc now. I take these.     http://shop.biocare.co.uk/templates/prod...      As I'm on long term antibiotics too as I have chronic health problems.    All the best|`|JTRVVzhXaa	It sounds like you have thrush.    Antibiotics give me thrush. Whenever I'm prescribed antibiotics I ask my doctor for a thrush pill too! You can get a single pill which you take with water and it'll start to get better within hours.    Hope this helps. :)
cv5wGV8Caa	squats are notoriously bad for your knees. you may not be able to get around the pain. I'd recommend just leg extensions and curls until they are better. Leg presses also create less impact on your kness while still involving the same range of motion and muscles used while squating. lunges can also be effective but can also be tough on the knees. try also using knee wraps to keep them warm and ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation and pain in your joints. If you continue to do squats with your knees hurting you could do permanent damage to yourself.|`|oxkPohphaa	it means ur a *****|`|3TWnIyCNaa	when i used to work out ,i found that after the workouot, having a few tablespoons of honey help with that same problem...i had someone tell me to try it ,when i was getting sore from working out..  i wasnt really trying to bulk up , just get definition.but it sounds like the same soreness i was dealing with myself....    p.s. switch routine up also,,your body will get used to a pattern..  for instance, one week start with your arms and chest , then the next week , end with arms and chest...dont have to do it by week,,can do it after a month if its easier to remeber....whatever you do ,dont do any drugs like steroids or stuff like that...unfortunately your pecker gets smaller if you do...good luck
9GxbG86Uaa	Guessing from the fact that you only are lifting 50 in squats, Im going to guess that you are relatively new to the squats... Even if you arent, this is very normal. There is a muscle in your knee that holds ur femur to your tibia and fibia... This muscle is easily strained.. I would keep off the squats for a while, but to help that muscle get better and stronger, I would bike for a few miles a day on a low tension until your knee feels better|`|VnLaUS3Jaa	have someone that is experienced in the weight room examine your form.    could be that you are locking out your knees at the end of each rep.

w5DqkitYaa	using heavy weights is probably causing it.  start out lighter and work your way up to the heavier weights.  since you said you are beginning to lift, then you should start light and stay light for a month before moving on to the heavier weights.  also cut out the squats, if you do them don't go for a full bend just about half way, should keep pressure off the knees to keep them going longer|`|zoH6rMCPaa	I have sore knees too, from carpet burn.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Sounds like you are overworking your body and not getting enough rest in between workout sessions.

6e398b592174ad3a1d8dca926e3df39faa	If you gently pull down your lower eyelid, in the `corner` nearest the nose, you will see what looks like a little hole. Indeed that is what it is, it is called a tear-duct, excess fluid from the eye drains away through this `hole` and goes down behind the nasal passage. Without this duct, we would be continually `crying` as the fluid having no where else to go, would overspill from the eye and run down our cheek.  When the wind blows it causes a surge in the fluid and often the duct cannot cope with the drainage, so the fluid or `tears ` run down our cheeks, giving the appearance of crying.|`|WWnkeaIAaa	it could mean left over water on the brain|`|e7WQxGSGaa	wear glasses !|`|sEGgph5Daa	its natural. the wind is blowing in your eyes which makes them dry up but u need your eyes wet so it naturally makes them water to keep them from drying out. to prevent that wear glasses|`|7jM9Ghchaa	to protect the eyes from becoming too dry?nature wins again|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Things that can dry out your eyes, like cold air or wind, will make eyes water.

u0qU6DzZaa	No, but if your having symptoms of some type you may have PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). It is an infection that can occur with an abortion.    A friend of mine passed out from this infection. She said it didn't "feel" that bad?! So if you feel like your having some type of STD symptoms have yourself checked. There are some natural consequences a woman will endear with an abortion.    Otherwise, and obviously, if you need to get checked they didn't do it at the abortion clinic, so go to your regular doctor.
KDst9z5Naa	If you take allergy medicine and it makes you feel better, you should keep taking it . Medicines do not normally damage the liver unless you take them 20-30 years and it really depends what medicine that is. I would not worry about liver damage.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	Talk to your doctor. Apparently your allergies are bad enough that without the medicine you have problems.    As for the liver damage- Well, it is possible with some medicines. But again, that's something you need to talk about with your doctor- Not your guardian.    Good luck.|`|8dREUd2xaa	What you should do is whatever you "have heard". Ask here from idiots who have zero medical training but strong opinions Follow whoever talks the loudest.|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	In general I don't like taking anything every day unless it's needed, but you obviously need it and suffer if you don't take it. My family has tons of allergies and we take Claritin daily but only when needed (seasonal). How about if you try cutting back to half the dosage and see if it still works for you? That will benefit your body by only having half, and also save you $.    As for the medicine damaging your liver, allergy meds should not have that side effect but if you're worried, I would go to the specific drug's website and read the prescribing directions (meant for physicians) and/or also call your allergist and ask. The drug website may have info on results of their long term studies. In general, if there is a danger from daily use, it will be listed on their warnings, but as you know we can't always trust what drug cos. say (not their fault completely!).

6NZeItMAaa	Avoid smoking, exercise and follow a low-fat diet.    you can follow the low-fat diet with no difficulty, without having to suffer unexciting series of daily menus. And you can lose excess (unhealthy) weight easily, safely, and without having to starve yourself or restrict your diet to only a few foods such as lettuce and cottage cheese.

fLzsH3Ohaa	UGH Such a vicious cycle. Lack of sleep makes you more anxious. Also- paxil just covers up the symptoms- it doesnt cure it. Imagine your car is overheating and you try to close the hood and keep driving. What you need to do is allow your engine (in your body) to over heat- butlet it cool off before driving again. Stress is normal. Don't be freaked out. I have been there- and it will come and go. You'll be fine. Talk to your doc about LOW doses of Xanax. Good luck.|`|HsX4H0FLaa	It could well be Paxil withdrawal.    - agitation/anxiety  - irritability/rage  - vivid dreams  - sleep disruption    ...are all pretty common withdrawal symptoms. How did you taper?     Did you perhaps experience any withdrawal symptoms like: light/sound/smell hypersensitivity, depression, nausea, dizziness, headaches, 'flu', bloating...    Anxiety and depression are described as being the most common withdrawal symptoms.
Byq9QDagaa	Baking Soda - can remove surface stains on teeth. Here's how to use:    First clean your toothbrush thoroughly. Now, shake your toothbrush fairly dry and dip it in the baking soda so it is completely covered. Brush in light circular motion. Another option is to mix baking soda and your favorite toothpaste and brush as usual. Do this once a week.

Gives you an idea of how tough times really were.  My parents survived the great depression.  I remember as a very little girl having to use baking soda.  I didn't like it much.  It is a natural enzyme so it would be safe.  I don't know about whitening but since it is an oxidizer (I know I'm using the wrong word but I mean it makes baked goods rise) I would think it would whiten.    I recommend you don't use the products off the shelf as they are harmful and eat enamel.  Just ask someone at a natural foods/ supplement store.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	this isn't the 1960's anymore. lol|`|oHENw1AXaa	ive heard that too. and ive also hear it works for a great face cleanser. i think your not supposed to brush with it but gargle and then brush with it. but dont gargle with your throat, just in your mouthh. you get me?|`|3Qxqh68xaa	A good portion of toothpaste is baking soda, you can also make your own toothpaste at home with baking soda.

aiBLNYhgaa	yeah...and they are called psychogenic non epileptic   seizures also know as pseudoseizures. they are called this cause they have no organic or biological cause and they usually result from stress. Like extreme amounts of stress. I use to have them all the time. I had doctors tell me that I was faking, that I have brain tumors, etc. There was this doctor that told me that I really needed to speak to someone like a psychiatrist cause I was under a lot of stress and that is why my body was responding this way. Look up conversion syndrome....and the above. But these can result from any kind of stress. You will be amazed what your body can do when it is taxed out from constant stress and repressed feelings|`|satoCRC6aa	Your body can react in many ways.

8HgvkFowaa	No b/c you only lose weight if you burn the calories that you consume. If you're not burning any, then fasting is pointless. Plus it slows your metabolism down, which makes it more difficult to burn calories.   The best way to lose weight is to eat smaller portions, eat regularly (don't skip meals) and instead of drinking tea, soda, that kind of stuff, switch to water. You'd be very surprised at what water can do for you. Also, being vegetarian is a great step in weight loss too. Meat contains lots of fats that are difficult to burn.|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	Nope. You lose weight in body mass and water, but your body puts it back on when you stop fasting. The best way to lose weight is to exercise.|`|AA12182074	Fasting causes you to lose muscle mass because your body goes into starvation mode and uses your muscles for energy.  Diet and exercise are the key to successful, long-term, weight-loss.|`|PoRuIi9Zaa	Well yes it does why should i lie? the only problem is that you as well need to add exercise any type or else it wont work but its not recommended cause fasting for several days, months can cause you malnutrition health problems for example anemia where you may think its not that bad but once you pass out, feel cold all the time and loose hair its not recommended

Finally, keep a steady schedule if you lose your timing per week itll slow down, working hard for a period of time is the only way... right now i sorta wanna stop typing cause karate killed my triceps ugh.. but yea do that cya|`|q0q79Inyaa	run,do pull ups,push ups and sit ups  try not to do weights until you are 18    try more protein and a little extra carbs and no sugar you want muscle potential not pot belly|`|7uuJlHGHaa	If you want to build muscle, and you are skinny, then you should start eating as much as possible.  You should focus on increasing your protein intake by eating more eggs, beans, fish, chicken, red meat, or milk.  You could also consider taking a protein supplement.  Make sure it's whey protein.  Also drink plenty of water since 70% of your body is water and muscles are a large part of your body.  Running is not that important if all you want to do is gain muscle mass as running will make you lose weight.  When you first start working out you should balance every exercise with its opposite (ie. If you do bench press then you should also do lat pull downs).  It's important to keep your body in balance.  Don't neglect your lower body; it's just as important.  You should give your body at least 48 hours rest between exercise sessions.  So just go about 3 days a week every other day.  After your first workout you will be sore as your body is not used to this kind of stress.  After about a week the soreness will go away.  Try doing 8 repetitions of your exercises for 4 sets.  The weight should be difficult to lift but light enough to perform the exercise correctly.  Your motion should be fluid and controlled, no jerking or swinging at all.  After a week or two with the same weight you should try increasing the weight by 5 pounds or so.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|zDf186Xyaa	You need to take the spare tyre to your local Garage. If sure they can dispose it for you|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...|`|yev2iWgWaa	added to exercise do yoga also you will be fit as anything|`|6bryNB1raa	join one of them classes at your local leisure centre for old bidders. or get a workout dvd davina power of 3 is good. or buy a treadmill or better yet go for long walks. try some sit ups (if thats possible)  or just put on some music and dance. cleaning your house as a certain speed will get your heart going and thats also good for you or walk up and down your stairs. goodluck.
eytlIKITaa	Although it's not good for you- think about it, you're inhaling smoke.  But, Pot is better for you than cigarettes and drinking combined!  So yeah, smoke a joint!  I wouldn't worry about it all that much!  : )|`|CsIvy5MAaa	No. There has not been a single, not bias medical study that says cannabis does any long term damage.    However: Smoking is bad for you. Burning marijuana produces the same chemicals as any other burning object (including tobacco). But, your taking in so little of these chemicals that the chances of you seeing any ill effects without some sort of prior medical condition are negligible.|`|c2f7ef4507c724db34ebbcc925ef59e1aa	Well any smoking's going to affect your health in the long run, but it really depends on the person and your genetic make-up. Maybe find another way to take the cannabis, you can put it in tea and stuff but the effects take longer to start, and can also last for quite a while. It's probably healthier to smoke cannabis in a joint with tobacco than in a bong or blunt because that way it's pure and the THC has a stronger effect- not necessarily on your heart but your head.    Just keep your smoking to a minimum and don't get addicted and most likely you'll be fine.|`|8uUpAKPtaa	if anything, the tobacco will hurt your heart more|`|MPCfQuT5aa	I don't think so but the tobacco will!!

You want us all to be honest with you so that you can worry about something you have already decided you wont change?    Still in answer to your other questions     Effects on the Heart    Within a few minutes after smoking marijuana, the heart begins beating more rapidly and the blood pressure drops. Marijuana can cause the heart beat to increase by 20 to 50 beats per minute, and can increase even more if other drugs are used at the same time.  Because of the lower blood pressure and higher heart rate, researchers found that users' risk for a heart attack is four times higher within the first hour after smoking marijuana.    How does smoking damage your heart?    Smoking harms your heart by:    damaging the lining of your arteries, leading to a build up of fatty material (atheroma) and a reduced space for blood to pass through   the carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke reduces the amount of oxygen that the blood can carry to your heart and body   the nicotine in cigarettes stimulates your body to produce adrenaline, which makes your heart beat faster and raises blood pressure, so your heart has to work harder   makes your blood more likely to clot.   All of these things increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease, or having a heart attack or stroke.|`|VUxQRujkaa	Your gonna die pretty young put it like that!

I was able to go into my First appointment with all the information needed for a referral to the endocrinologist and started shot at 10 weeks.    My recommendation would be to start testing now (you should still have your GC meter) it the your numbers are high start following your diet. If they continue to be high call your OB with your numbers and food journal and ask to go straight to the endocrinologist.    I am not a doctor but with a history of GD you need to be tested well before 27 weeks.     Good Luck!

LBD3CLqGaa	Mathematically speaking you'll burn more calories standing as your leg muscles are tensed and your back muscles support your torso.    However, from an "optimized" point of view, standing while doing exercises you can do sitting or laying down is spending a few extra calories while doing much less exercises as standing will tire you and deplete the energy you'd normally spend on your exercising.    Focus your energy spending on the part of the body you are now training on. Avoid spending a bit of energy from every parts of your body.    Energy spent = fatigue but   General Fatigue = low morale  low morale = less exercising    Whereas a located and centralized pain will feel "healthy"|`|q9i5f0rXaa	Yes, but the difference is going to be inconsequential.....it's really not worth worrying about.|`|2W5xfxCHaa	sit up

NJXBOx4Maa	Sounds pretty normal.  The bruising is from blood pooling around the injury.  It's fairly normal for gravity to pull the blood and swelling down to the lower edge of your foot.  But you really should be trying to stop the swelling, so your foot can start to heal.  Start with R.I.C.E:     Rest: Don't walk on it if its really painful or makes you limp (use crutches if needed).  Ice: Ice the ankle 20 minutes every 2 hours (most important for the first two days after injury).  Compression: Keep the ankle wrapped up with an ace bandage or equivalent (firm, but not so tight you stop blood from getting to your toes).  Elevation: When you can, keep your foot elevated (above your heart is best).    If you have difficulty putting weight on your foot for several days or your ankle doesn't show continual improvement you should see a doctor.    Most ankle injuries are much better in two weeks, but bad ones can take a couple of months.  Sounds like yours isn't too bad (I am assuming you are now walking with little to no pain).|`|AA11004428	you're asking if a bruised, swollen ankle is normal...i would hope not. at least mine aren't.|`|BJuHbQXfaa	In June my mother thought she twisted her ankle in a hole in the yard as well. She thought it was just sprained and it swelled then bruised just like yours. She went and got it check out here her ankle was broken.  You need to get it checked out asap so you do not cause anymore damage to the ankle. Usually after you twisted or sprained something it does not bruise. Good Luck!|`|QqBjcZmaaa	no, its should still hurt by now and bruising and swelling is normal when that happens  it takes a good couple of weeks to fully heal, depending on how bad you twisted it  if you put ice on it right away it would prevent the swelling, im not sure if you did or not. just make sure you stay off of it   but i guess if still hurts a lot in a while you could go to a physiotherapist just get it checked out  get better soon!|`|jCQXXPHWaa	Totally wrong!      You can bruise after any sprain, strain, fracture, dislocation or subluxation.  If you broke a blood vessel , the blood leaks out into the surrounding area.  At first it may look just swollen or slightly red because the blood has oxygen in it but as the blood dies (normal) it looses its oxygen and turns blue.  Usually within a few days to a week depending on how badly injured you are and whether or not you are taking care of it by Resting, Icing, Compression, Elevation and Ibuprofen.    It does sound like a minor sprain but since I cant see it I cant say for sure.  Here is some general advice for sprains.    In the first 2-3 days ice every hour for 20 min's after that alternate heat and ice.  Ice after activity , or being on your feet all day and heat when you've had lots of rest.  Take ibuprofen as recommended on pkg.  Use an ace bandage to get rid of swelling and for extra support when you need to be on it.  If in a week or two your still unsure if its healing properly or not see your dr.
H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible (ophthalmologist).  Pain in the eye can be an important symptom and can't be safely ignored for long. Fortunately it is an unusual complaint. Itching and burning are more common. Eye pain may be due to injury, infection or an underlying disease.  An important disease that can cause eye pain is glaucoma. Glaucoma may slowly lead to blindness if not treated. In glaucoma, the fluid inside the eye in under abnormally high pressure and the globe of the eye is tense, causing discomfort. And good luck.|`|BENiX8eDaa	You might want to go to an eye doctor to see if there are any changes in your vision, they also take a look at the overall health of your eyes, and you can mention the sharp pain.  It's your eyes, your vision, so you dont want to mess around--see a professional.  Then you can have some peace-of-mind, because it's probably nothing serious at all.|`|puJxykXeaa	ur eyesight night be really very weak go see ur doc immediately.it could get serious
jRdoDu3raa	You might be a later bloomer.  you could look to you mom or any fem able blood relatives (you moms or dads sisters) as to what you MIGHT expect.

Don't worry about it!
ZbMLigR3aa	Yes, a CBC is fairly normal.  The reason it is done as part of a yearly exam can be due to many factors.  Sometimes doctors are checking your blood sugar levels, clotting factors and other simple things that wouldn't require a full spectrum blood panel.  However, if your health has recently changed or you feel that it is necessary, you can request that your gynecologist run a full blood panel.  I hope this helps.|`|AA10628838	I think it is a great idea to do a finger prick. Sometimes you can be anemic and do not really understand why you have been feeling tired and out of sorts. Women can be inclined to have it if they have heavy menses. If they do a finger prick it should be done more on the side of the finger tip that the top of the finger tip to avoid it hurting so badly.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	My doc does not do that.  Have you had issues with blood sugar in the past? Or did you tell them you are having symptoms of something? I think all docs are different (I have a friend that gets anal exams from her doc, which I found strange).|`|nMR5TfGAaa	Man I hate the finger prick!  Whenever they would try to do it, I would show them my arm.  (after I was 12 of course) You can refuse it.  Just like I never allow and IV on the back of my hand, makes me pass out.
qkb2XRIIaa	sounds bacterial and viral. the muscle pains are usually viral, and are from the head and body.  The sore throat and inflammed throat tell me theres some bacteria.    your best bet is to drink a LOT of gatoraid, and take a tylenol for the pain|`|LNV6xT6Eaa	maybe strep throat.. all the symptoms that you have is like strep throat..  try having lot of rest and drink a lot of fluids..    hope this helps and get well soon! :)|`|AA11101806	my initial thought is that you might have a strep infection, but you really need to go to a doctor if you have all of those symptoms togeher.
AA11176387	I have a vitamin luckily and it is strong enough to grind hard roots into powder so I don't have this problem, but according to Dr Richard schulze who cured hundreds of thousands or more of all types of incurable illnesses through his 20 year clinic and writings, said tinctures should be at least 1/2 herb and one half menstrum (vodka)    He personally packs his formulas sold in his store up to the top with herbs and then adds the vodka and sometimes even double concentrates it for weaker herbs like red clover.    So 1/2 and 1/2 is perfect.  I do all my tinctures half and half and yes if you want you can add more vodka or more herbs to be a 50-50 mix once the mixture settles.    If possible use organic or wildcrafted herbs as these are 7-10 times higher in the phytochemicals that cure and prevent disease..for things like pine resins you will have to use 100 proof vodka but for most tinctures 80 proof is used.    I would suggest if the root has softened from sitting in the tincture a while to open the jar take out the by  straining  it out and chop it up and then re-add it to the liquid again so more gets into your tincture    steep for at least a month (2 weeks minimum) ..sometimes I just leave the herb in and strain dip some from the top if I want it extra potent.  I have several year old tinctures with the herbs still in them..if I want some I strain a little out.  this makes it stronger as it cures and not wasting the herbs.    Be sure to label and date it five years from the date you strained as the expiration date but tinctures over 100 years old have been fine so it will last much longer.    Be sure to store your tinctures in a dark cupboard or in a dark colored glass like blue, green or brown or paint the outside of your bottles or store in a paper bag as light deteriorates it.    It will not hurt at all to open it..      The usual dose for a 150 pound person is two dropperfuls (60 drops) 3 to 5 times a day Sometimes people only take Valerian at bedtime though as it makes you sleepy.    If you weigh considerably under or over 150 or for a pet or child dose, see clark's rule explained here.    http://curezone.com/schulze/handbook/CAD...    I highly recommend that you watch the save your life videos in the later videos he shows how to make all kinds of herbal products from tinctures to ointments and snuffs and so much more and he talks about herbal quality..also has a lot of good info for the person using herbs in his manual.    These originally cost $435 and are out of prints but I have the links and can send them to you to download for free.  These will really up your knowledge of natural healing and I feel so blessed to have discovered them and use the knowledge to help very ill and dying people.    Just send me your email address if you are interested and I will forward the links for you to the videos and manual    .|`|z6mbVz8maa	yes.

9GxbG86Uaa	It would mean that you have a glandular problem. If you have this, I would go see your general medical practitioner for medicine to deal with it. (The medicine will help your body burn up calories so they do not get stored as fat)|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Greed|`|KJDrXtebaa	The personal trainer was right in it being a glandular disorder; however, the treatment for it is not necessarily weight loss drugs. Instead your doctor may choose to give you medicines to help regulate the hormones and chemicals that your body isn't producing properly. It's always preferable that your body learn to process what you take in without the aid of weight loss drugs which can have serious and frustrating side effects.    Diagnostic testing for these conditions may involve blood work, CAT scans, MRIs, and/or biopsys. If you think you may have this condition then your doctor will refer you to an endocrinologist. Once your bodies chemicals are regulated you can work with your doctors and/or a nutritionist to get back to a healthy weight.
XLXncQu9aa	You need to clean the burn first.  Use alcohol or Neosporen.  Secondly, you can put coco butter on it.  Coco butter works best when you want to reduce the look of any scarring.  Just apply twice each day and eventually the burn will heal.|`|EKT1qvyXaa	I agree with them. Wash it off and put lotion or cream on it.|`|hpFsK6DXaa	Clean it. Put some kind of cream that treats burnt skin tissue on the burnt spot and cover it up unless specified otherwise on the lotion container.
AA10075092	I used to take prozac about 4 years ago for anxiety.I had a hard time talking to people and felt like I was stupid if I said anything I just felt really anxious all the time and couldn't concentrate always felt nervous.When I started taking it at first I felt like I was always off into space,but after taking it for a few weeks I could tell it was helping me alot.I was more talkative and didn't feel like I was in my box anymore.Then I was stupid and stopped taking it for awhile.Then one day I decided to take it and I was driving and for some stupid reason I drove through a red light almost smashing into a truck.I think it was from the sideffects cause I was feeling spaced out and wasn't paying attention.So just be careful when taking this med don't start taking it then stop and I would take it before you go to bed.So after the incident I completely stopped and now wish I hadn't cause now im back in the rut. I need to go back and talk to my doctor.Hope this helps in a way.|`|2TAFN9lzaa	I didn't get a numb, zombie feeling at all. It just felt like it cleared the tar out of my brain. I could think straighter. I could be happy. I could relate to people again. I didn't feel like it changed my personality, just got rid of the depression.    I'm not saying it's a decision to take lightly. And I have no doubt that all medicines have different effects on different people. Have you tried other things for your depression? Like counseling? Whatever you decide, I hope you feel better soon.|`|fLzsH3Ohaa	I took Prozac when I was depressed- and it saved my life. However- 10 years later- I wasn't depressed- but anxious- and my doctor prescribed it again, it made me crazy. Really. 2 weeks later I questioned MAD COW disease LOL> So just be aware of your feelings in the 1st 2 weeks- when you are still yourself. Stay in touch with your doc, and you should be fine. Even if you end up trying other meds. It should end up ok.  Best of luck and be blessed. God hasn't forgotten you.
AA11481525	Hi--    I am familiar with a frame called PURE.    It is a semi-rimless frame---the lens is held in with a nylon cord--  (like fish line)    It is not a "high-end" frame, but it also is not poorly made.    It is a little more delicate than other semi-rimless I have seen.    If the lenses are made correctly, and are mounted correctly it will last for several years without problems.      It has a  nice shape, and the colors and sizes are good.    I would say if you like it, you would enjoy it.    (there may be several other frames called PURE out there also.)
1b3ac8d699cc339a3db4dd1ee14d810aaa	If i had to pick i would pick worse. Thats just because when you sweat you seem to break out more with pimples/zits.

HDyqzvUkaa	Of course he loved it.  What is does is release all your Serotonin, flooding your brain with Happy.  This unnatural release damages that part of brain and cannot be repaired.  You will never be able to be as happy as you could have been.    It's not a horrible thing to try and it won't have drastic effects if you only do it a few times.    Monthly it will eventually put a hole in ya brain.    And remember when someone thinks there going to start doing an addictive substance habitually, it eventually becomes more and more frequent.       THC should be out of your system by now.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Ecstacy can stay in your system for up to 3years as can marijuana depending on the amounts and how long you've been taking it    Ecstacy can heighten your sense of feeling of love and everything else that you feel  It has aphrodisiac|`|aRA8A54kaa	You're asking me if taking ecstasy is healthy??   No.|`|kG5XVSueaa	THC stays in your system for a very long time because it stores in your fat cells and can be released in small doses as you burn that fat and as for your friend he shouldn't go all out on x because he will grow a tolerance to it and then 1 pill wont do it for him anymore and then he will be taking more and more to feel the equivalent to 1 pill
ufgv7oTjaa	Oh I'm so sorry to hear about that... it's always a shame when a prescription causes such a severe medical condition, especially when doctors are talking about surgery for the medical condition it caused. It always saddens my heart to hear things like that.    There are several natural supplements aside from Glucosamine that help joint health, which may remove the cause of his pain. The most popular are Microlactin, Tart Cherries, Chondroitin, MSM, Hyaluronic Acid, Danish Rose Hips, and Bromelain.  The only thing to really watch out for is allergies, specifically that Microlactin is from milk. As long as he's not allergic, you should have no problem.     As a side note, I would suggest consulting a doctor that knows more about nutrition (eg. a Naturopath) to see if they can recommend a good alternative for the asthma medication. It's usually best on the system to remove the source of the problem than to treat the symptoms. Good luck!|`|qZUsjjYhaa	so sorry to hear that.    I don't know if you have availability but Ayurvedic therapy can cure it completely. The process of "panchkarma" will certainly cure it but it will take 2-3 months time.

oVxr5B3Eaa	That actually looks like a diabetic needle.. Someone testing their blood sugar. It goes in a little machine that is spring loaded and shoots the needle at your finger, then a drip of blood comes out and tests with that.  Best thing to do is wrap it up, put it is a bag, and bring it to the doctor (or better yet, ER). Tell them she was pricked with it. They'll be able to test the needle, and take blood around the site in which your niece was priced. it might only be a diabetic needle but there is noting saying they weren't carrying some type of disease. Make sure you report your findings back to the store. In the SLIGHT chance she caught something, it's best to test early and take immediate action rather than let it get out of hand.  Good luck!|`|1rMEP8HAaa	it looks like the half tubes they use to draw blood, i hope you got medical advice to be on the safe side the dirty rotton scoundrals|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	The picture isn't clear. Is it just a needle and not a syringe? I don't know if that can be identified, but the police should know. If your niece was stuck, I'm afraid she may need to be tested for HIV and other infections.
Q4ggnG0waa	I had surgery for a tumor also. It was a mix of those cells and another. Mine was also a stage 3. My doc got it all with surgery, but cells may still be abnormal so I had radiation and chemo at the same time. Where is his tumor located and how large was it? Many times this determines some odds of getting rid of it. I got a month break and am now doing chemo 5 days on, 23 days off. I hope his dr informed him of this type of treatment. If not, he's not a very caring dr. He's very young and has a good chance of it not coming back for years. He must remain diligent in his check ups and mris for a while to come.|`|Fp0cN6Miaa	I am 14 and have anaplastic astrocytoma stage 3 I was diagnosed in April 2008 and have gone through surgery, chemo, and radiation. I personally am not going to give you an answer with statistics or numbers but here it is...    I personally don't believe in looking at statistics and my dad and I don't ever ask the doctors. Cancer is very different with each individual and I honestly believe that you have a lot of control over what happens.    I would encourage you and your friend to read Lance Armstrong's book It's Not about The Bike.    It has completley changed my outlook on how I am dealing with my Cancer and the goals I am setting in my life.    LIVESTRONG
RUCrhhWuaa	Well the probably is an infection in his hand due to The needle so go back to the hospital cuz when i had blood drawn the same thing happened so yea go to the doctor or hospital|`|PF2FBKBDaa	you too vain
kg0ig2Edaa	The honest answer here is that it's all a little tricky.     Your psychologist may be asking to see your cuts merely to make sure you are telling the truth and not simply playing for sympathy so that she doesnt go down the wrong course in treating you and making things worse rather than better try to bear that in mind.      Harming yourself in itself is I would say wrong however if properly controlled shouldnt be an issue. You may not want to kill yourself but you do need to be carefull nonetheless how you cut, where you cut (location rather than physically) etc.     This may all be" teaching you to suck eggs" but I figure it needs saying anyway, as if you were to cut yourself somewhere where there are no people about for long periods of time and something went wrong you could kill yourself by accident.     Technically as i understand it your psychologist CANNOT tell anyone anything that you tell her as its bound by patient doctor confidentiality ( Though you may wish to consult a legal bod on that). Therefore if im right there is no harm in admitting that you cut yourself to her. If she is any good she wont tell you to stop doing so.     Her course of action should be to help you with advice on cutting yourself safely and to try counsel you through your problems to stop you feeling the need to cut yourself.    Hope some of the extra long essay i just wrote helps you a bit.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	You need to keep seeing them because you are still thinking it's normal to like cutting yourself, IT ISN'T, so until you get your mind right stay with them, you will soon understand that they only have your best interest at heart. I'm sorry you have had such a troubled past but that is no good reason for you to hurt yourself, you did nothing wrong, you were the victim, you need to understand that and forgive yourself.|`|AA10148924	Your counselor and psychologist should know. You need help only your psychologist is taking the wrong method to help you. Write down how you feel and give the letter to your psychologist. She must know that her treatment method is not helping you and can be making things worse. You need help and don't deny it. Please take care of yourself. We need you with us on this site.|`|RzZBU8elaa	sorry hun. ounce you get stucked in by these types of people your pretty much screwed. these types of people arent really trying to help they just need tomake a living and will keep you for as long as they'd like. just hang in there since the money isnt coming out of your pockets.|`|43769776f4128a4bec47a0e8a7748039aa	1st off ok. Cutting your wrists or any part of your body is something not right ok. It means you have a anger still lingering you wanting to take out the hostility out on the person who sexually abused you.     You may think you are ok... in your mind. That is because your mind is telling you that you are free from the pain and anger...when really you are not free from the pain and anger. Trust me.. you still need to talk more what makes you want to cut yourself and who you blame for your cutting yourself. You need to be more open to your counselor and your psychologist.     Seriously dude.. you are not ready to be said you are ok yet. You still have a few lingering issues yet. be calm.. and be open about your problems. I wish you well.|`|I3wY7wD9aa	She is trying to help you to stop cutting. Cutting is not normal and needs to seriously addressed.  She will continue to ask to 'see' until she i sure that you have stopped. Your rapid weight loss is also a serious problem. Both of which I am sure that she is questioning. Do NOT lie. This will solve nothing.   It is important that you continue to see your psychologist. Do not stop ad be sure to take all medications as prescribed. If you are not on medication; you may need to be to help you through this time in your life.   The next time you want to cut yourself.; try to stop first and ask 'why' you are doing it and if it really makes the problems go away. It's a 'quick fix' for some but a very dangerous one. Ask your psychologist for a 'Crisis Line' phone number and try to use it instead.   I know it's not easy.   Someone has hurt you terribly and you do not have to hurt yourself too.|`|Gt3e6j3Gaa	well first of all good for you losing all that weight. second you need to imform her that yu are not thinking about killing your self any more and that you fell good about yoour self now. oh and smile to make it convinceing

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Your yeast infection was probably caused by the antibiotics, which kill both the bad and good bacteria in your system, including those in the vagina.  The antibiotics should be out of your system in 7 days, and the Monistat 3 should take care of the infection.  However, I always had better luck with the 7 day treatment.  If it doesn't get better, you can follow up with another monistat treatment or call your doctor for a duflcan pill to help the infection.

2gegv4smaa	Snoring is a common condition that can affect anyone, although it occurs more frequently in men and people who are overweight. Snoring has a tendency to worsen with age.    Occasional snoring is usually not very serious and is mostly a nuisance for your bed partner. However, if you are a habitual snorer, you not only disrupt the sleep patterns of those close to you, but you also impair your own sleep quality. Medical assistance is often needed for habitual snorers (and their loved ones) to get a good night's sleep.  What Causes Snoring?    Snoring occurs when the flow of air through the mouth and nose is physically obstructed. Air flow can be obstructed by a combination of factors, including:        * Obstructed nasal airways: Some people snore only during allergy seasons or when they have a sinus infection. Deformities of the nose such as a deviated septum (a structural change in the wall that separates one nostril from the other) or nasal polyps can also cause obstruction.      * Poor muscle tone in the throat and tongue: Throat and tongue muscles can be too relaxed, which allows them to collapse and fall back into the airway. This can result from deep sleep, alcohol consumption and use of some sleeping pills. Normal aging causes further relaxation of these muscles.      * Bulky throat tissue: Being overweight can cause bulky throat tissue. Also, children with large tonsils and adenoids often snore.      * Long soft palate and/or uvula: A long soft palate or a long uvula (the dangling tissue in back of the mouth) can narrow the opening from the nose to the throat. When these structures vibrate and bump against one another, the airway becomes obstructed causing snoring.    Health Risks Associated With Snoring    Habitual snorers can be at risk for serious health problems, including obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea creates several problems, including:        * Long interruptions of breathing (more than 10 seconds) during sleep caused by partial or total obstruction or blockage of the airway.      * Frequent waking from sleep, even though you may not realize it.      * Light sleeping. People with obstructive sleep apnea sleep lightly to try to keep their throat muscles tense enough to maintain airflow.      * Strain on the heart. Prolonged suffering from obstructive sleep apnea often results in higher blood pressure and may cause enlargement of the heart, with higher risks of heart attack and stroke.      * Poor night's sleep. This leads to drowsiness during the day and can interfere with your quality of life.    How to stop snoring  ===============  Snoring can often seem like a problem without a solution  especially when it is getting in the way of a good nights sleep for you and your partner. If you want to stop snoring, it is important to consider the cause and severity of your snoring. Identifying the cause can help you choose the right cure.    It also makes sense to try some simple non-invasive treatments first to see if they will reduce or prevent your snoring. See the section on Self help tips and remedies below for more information on these snoring cures.        * Sleep on your side      * Elevate the head of your bed      * Limit alcohol and medications      * Clear your nasal passages      * Lose weight    You may find that your snoring persists even after trying these changes. If your snoring results from a more serious cause, a cure may be more complex  but there are solutions. Your nights dont have to be noisy! Read on to learn more about the possible causes of your snoring as well as treatment options. If you can uncover the cause of your snoring, you should be able to find a cure that is right for you    Causes out of our control   Causes within our control        * Heredity - A narrow throat, a cleft palate, enlarged adenoids and other physical attributes which contribute to snoring can be hereditary.      * Being middle-aged or beyond - As you age, your throat becomes narrower, and the muscle tone in your throat decreases.      * Being male - Men have narrower air passages than women and are more likely to snore.      * Allergies, asthma, a cold, or sinus infections - Blocked airways make inhalation difficult and create a vacuum in the throat, leading to snoring             * Being overweight or out of shape - Fatty tissue and poor muscle tone contribute to snoring.      * A history of smoking  Smoking (or exposure to second-hand smoke) relaxes muscles and creates nasal congestion.      * Alcohol or medications - Alcohol and  medications increase muscle relaxation leading to more snoring.      * Sleeping posture - Sleeping flat on your back allows the flesh of your throat to relax and block the airway.    Medical cures and treatments for snoring    If your own efforts to stop snoring do not help, consult your physician or an otolaryngologist (ENT, or ear, nose, and throat doctor). If you choose to try a dental appliance for your snoring, you will need to see a dentist specializin|`|ZZ5Rm406aa	Snoring is caused by a lot of causes.   Examples:    1.

This can serve as your guide as you start your loose weight program.     Water plays a big role in loosing weight. Drink a lot of water every day. Drinking at least 8 to 10 glasses per day can help you get rid of the toxins in your body. Water can help you create a feeling of fullness when you are hungry.     Exercise is important since physical activities are the most important way of burning that stubborn. Remember, loosing weight does not mean starving. Starving is not the best way of loosing weight. It will add insult to injury because starving is never a healthy option to include in your diet plan. What you need to do is decrease the portion size of your food.     Try eating on a saucer and not on a plate. This will make you avoid piling food on the saucer as much as you do when you are eating on a plate.     You have to avoid eating junk food and sodas. It is one of the biggest factor why you get bigger everyday. Too much salt and sugar can never be healthy.     You do not have to abruptly stop drinking soda. All you have to do is cut down on it gradually. A bottle off each meal a day is helpful. Soon you will no, you are off soda and junk food.    EAt more fruits and vegetables. If you are on a diet, you can try Acai berries. This is a fruit from Brazil which is dubbed to be the healthiest fruit with all the nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants it have. This will help you the most when you are trying to loose weight weight compromising your nutritional intake.    Set realistic goals when you want to loose weight. Keep that positive attitude towards loosing weight. It can take you a long way in your weight loose goal.

I know because I was on it at the same time my wife and I were trying to get pregnant with IUI. It totally sucks! It isn't a good thing like some inexperienced people say here.    My doctor gave me Viagra to help out. It was terrible! With Viagra and Prozac my penis was saying, "Alright! let's have at it!" while my brain was saying, " (yawn) Anyone know the score of the Knicks game last night?"    On top of that I had to masturbate in one of those rooms at the doctor's office in order to do the IUI. It took forever to finish. I'm sure everyone noticed as I could hear the doors to the other rooms (with other similar patients) open and close a few times before I was done.    If it is a real hindrance, talk to your doctor to find another anti-depressant that won't effect your friend.
jidM3Qxyaa	Firstly, don't stress about drinking the alcohol. You are correct, pregnancy and alcohol DON"T mix. But many people have a bit of a binge before they know they are pregnant and are fine.    Generally I would say that if you were pregnant you would be not hungry rather than more hungry, but everyone is different. When I was pregnant (first few weeks anyway) I just felt ill all the time regardless of whether I had eaten or not. I also did not have any aches in my tummy.    I had the morning after pill about 10 years ago, so things may have changed since then - but it messed me around big time. I was very sick for about a week. But what you are talking about is quite a bit after the fact. To put your mind at rest, I would go and do a pregnancy test. I have no idea where in the world you are, but here in Australia there are a number of different places that you can get a free pregnancy test from. There are also very cheap tests available on Ebay - they work but just don't come with collection bowls or fancy packaging.    Good luck, and perhaps consider going on the pill or being a bit more careful.

In this syndrome, a nervous or anxious person becomes concerned about his or her breathing and feels unable to get enough air into the lungs. This is often associated with chest pain or tightness.  The sensation of being out of breath leads to over breathing and a lowering of the carbon dioxide level in the blood.

6MRcqskIaa	it does not sound like you are having a problem being diagnosed with DID or having DID. It sounds like the only problem you are experiencing is having a romantic relationship. There are several things you can do to identify a abusive person prior to the relationship being emotionally tied. For instance look for early warning signs like, is he the jealous type, does he have children (why did the relationship end and make it your business to find out both version and not just the man view), does he have little respect for the law, does he plan the dates only (cancel dates, reschedule dates on your term as well - it is a good tester), does he constantly call you - wanting to know everything you do, cause he says he care. Basically say "no", and if he doesn't respect your NO ------ run for the hills and don't look back.     Now what I haven't discussed here is if the alter is causing the problem. If another alter is choosing the relationships then you might need to educate the alter. if you don't have connections with the alter then  you might need to consider discussing this over with the psychologist, so that he/she can educate the alter.|`|AaCGO2Suaa	at least you have all that, your making it 2 much of a big deal, my buddy is a gimp and he sucks and things, but that doenst hold him back and he does good things, dont let 1 flaw let your look on life let you down, your a good kid|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Its really hard when you first recieve a diagnosis but its not the end of the world.  Lots of people lead fulfilling lives despite their mental health problems.  If you're not already, ask your doctor if you can be referred to a therapist to work through some of your childhood issues.  It may help things a bit and also help you to move on in a positive way in the future.|`|oryUuc8Uaa	atleast you'll never be alone, lol|`|dh3l99QXaa	you will do great im sure.I some times turn into different personalities myself and i love it|`|7z3800Qbaa	..................im not what i would do but i would get some therapy on that..............|`|MLpfzoexaa	You will be fine... :)  A good friend of mine has D.I.D. as well, and she has 3 very distinct personalities, but hardly anyone notices... She's in college and doing very well... So i think as long as you don't give it too much thought, it won't affect your social life in the slightest...
Z1GS3gMKaa	Well I just started therapy 2months ago.for depression &self harm.and im the same way I feel really uncomfortable talking 2 someone about my issues.But I just talked 2 my parents&they took me 2 see someone.if ur in college the counseling center has free counseling&if ur in highschool u can talk 2 ur counselor&they can speak 2 ur parents about finding u a private therapist 2 speak 2.also it helps if ur willing 2 be open&honest with the therapist u talk 2 about ur issues.tell them that ur nervous talking 2 them.and they can help you relax a little that's what I did.But overall their will be days that you don't want to listen to what they r telling you.and on the other hand their will days that you r actually looking forward to  a therapy session.Therapy can be very uncomfortable at first but trust me its worth it! And life can and does get better.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	The most important thing is to be honest. The first session is likely to be a Q&A session, he/she will probably pepper you with questions in order to get an idea of what your issues are. There's really nothing to be nervous about; this is essentially "your" therapy. The more you talk, the more you will get used to the idea, and the more you will be able to "loosen up." It takes practice, and a lot of hard work.       It would be a good idea to tell your therapist that you have a problem with talking, and that you have trust issues. This would be very helpful to your therapist to know. Psychotherapy is a long process, and can't be forced.       It sounds like you are anticipating a horrible time. It's the anticipation that causes your mind to put up walls, and that's not a good thing. Try to focus on the positive, you're getting treatment, you'll have somebody to talk to that understands, and if all goes well,( and there's no reason to think it won't), you will learn enough about yourself that you can leave your depression behind, and live a happy, healthy, productive life.        Your nervousness is perfectly natural. This person is a stranger, and that's not an easy thing to deal with. You'll probably be telling this person things that you've never told anyone before. That's kinda scary. Then on the other hand, if you can learn to cope with your depression, it'll be worth every minute of your discomfort, won't it?           Be positive. Think of the gains you'll make.                Good luck! =)|`|qIcWac3Yaa	Hi,    I've tried therapy before, and it wasn't so bad.  Basically, at the start of every session he would just ask me what was on my mind, and I would just start chatting away and he would listen.  Most of the time it was me talking and him listening, but every now and then he would ask me a question, like, "And how did that make you feel?"  Other times he would express empathy.  It was very much how I expected it to be really, having seen (fictional) therapists in films, etc.    I would recommend trying it.  If you don't like it, you can just quit therapy or try a different therapist.  Even if you just end up quitting, it's quite an interesting experience!  At least you could say that you had the bravery to try it!
zNjjuZK6aa	This is the best method that I have found that will guarantee you lose as much weight as possible.  Wear as many sets of clothing as you can and take as long of a jog as possible (at least 30 minutes) after that, go into a steamy room to sweat it out (a shower is a good place), while still wearing your clothes.  This will have you lose a good few pounds and from there you can fall asleep, but also wear as much clothing and blankets as you can when you do so that you will continue to lose weight as you sleep.  Also, you must not eat for a period of days. This is one of the fastest methods of losing quick weight that I know of.|`|Glww6EA1aa	Your best bet is to start off by eating fruits, veggies, and lean protein in conjunction to working out with cardio and weights (everyday). No sweets, sugar, carbs, etc. If you get hungry at night, try drinking a large glass of water. When I did this, I lost five pounds a week. It's not easy, but it could work.|`|ydNj7YM6aa	It is possible to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and accept that if you lose weight fast then you will inevitably put it all back on again just as fast. The one diet which really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I shed 20 pounds, it really does produce success!
9Bmd3Haeaa	why not stay natural?  i am sure, a real woman, would love u and not the size of ur penis|`|osY0xlhTaa	The best thing about getting a bigger penis is the self confidence that it gives you. Women don't understand this, but all men know how it feels (or can imagine how it would feel) to be well endowed.    Some of the methods are dodgy - especially surgery, pills or hanging weights. But there are natural methods (especially exercises using just your hands) that can be very effective, if done right.    I found a site with lots of information about all the methods - check it out.    http://www.biggerbetterman.com|`|TBZNbhlNaa	if you want to enlarge it thats fine because every guy thinks about it , not me, even though i did at one point. i mean considering im only 17 i d8 19-23 yr olds and they all say its big even after we broke up i mean just stay natural. there realy is no side effects. you just have to keep taken the pill for the rest of your life.|`|q0q79Inyaa	mine is small but just let it grow.it is faith if you have a small penis then live with it    maybe do some sex exercise.......just don't do drugs because it makes you like have other problems

I he is tall for his age he is probably not obese , maybe just a little overweight , but if he isn't tall then I would just call or invite his mom over and say you were worried about his health , or get you husband to .  You could even try to talk to the kid . Maybe you can get his dad to take him to excerecise . You know whats funny? I know a 12 year old who weighs ten pounds less than that and he is only six...|`|ih8PG93Laa	Yes, but everyone is built differently. Just don't buy junk food, so he can't ask for, because there will be none there, or keep it out of sight in your room. And, my brother was really overweight, and wouldn't eat fruit until my mom started making fruit dip, it is simple you just mix cream cheese and marshmallow creme together, and you can dip it with any fruit. We also got my brother in all athletic teams (here they are baseball, football, and basketball). As for bringing it up, I have no clue, that is a very touchy subject!!!     Hope I helped :-)|`|AA12040558	He is definetly too heavy giving his age. He is overweight, pretty close to been obese.

BJugETlOaa	I try to do something that makes me happy. I like to scrapbook so I do that, and I love movies so I will watch a happy movie not a depressing one. I get in really down moods, I just want to cry and sleep for a day or two. Make sure you are eating a healthy diet, if you are getting a good diet you are less likely to be depressed. Take some time for yourself. Go shopping or spend time with someone you haven't seen in awhile.|`|AZPxEhL3aa	I usually cut myself when I feel depressed, it's a great coping technique.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	do something to your house to make it feel homey.

What I mean is that there may be some sort of void in your life.  I am married as well and have been for 10 years now and yes at times it can be overbearing because it's a huge step into your life.  You have to be willing to talk and take the time to grow with your spouse and be on the same accord.  I don't know your religious opinions or foundation but maybe you and your spouse should try Jesus Christ.  He is pure LOVE and he is the ANSWER to all your questions.  I am not going to push him onto you, but I will say that if you and your spouse put him first in your daily lives you will see POSITIVE changes and the way you are feeling right now will change.  I am not saying they will change permanently because there are going to be problems due to the world we live in, but you will go about them in a total different way and may even laugh at how you use to go about handling situations.  See when you have faith and you truly act out on your faith and stand strong mountains will move out of your way and in your heart you will have this undescribable feeling of Joy and contentment and you will know where it came from.  Your job may get you out of the house right now to help you cope with stress and depression but that is only temporary.  Attack the issue at hand and communicate to your spouse.  Instead of looking at negatives look at the positives and go from there.  Keep your positives positive and turn your negatives into positives to where you begin to have an equal balance in your marriage.  For the ones that stay depressed they usually end up divorced which creates more stress and possibility of falling into a deeper mind of depression which may cause devastation.  Remember you married your spouse for a certain reason and obviously that reason made you happy.  Go back to that and start to build on that, but here me when I say this IF YOU DON'T HAVE COMMUNICATION AND TRY TO RUN AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS YOU WILL ONLY HURT YOURSELF AND YOUR SPOUSE IN THE LONG RUN.  Don't worry about what society says a marriage should be, or what your spouse should look like, or what you or your spouse has done in the past.  The past is the past and you can't get it back.  Forgive first then forget then move on.  You did not mention that in your question, but see I have been led by the Lord to bring that to your attention.  What you are going through does not single you out for millions are going through the same thing.   Like I said I have been down your road, but now I am off and on a MUCH better path.  Am I saying that I am better than you, not at all.  I am not better than you, I just found a better solution and a better reason to stick with it due to Jesus Christ.  I am fully committed and hope that you will find him, except him into each of your lives and let him lead you where he wants you to go.  You will be amazed.  I plant the seed now into you as I write this to you and hope that you will one day put your testimony out there to help others going through trial and tribulations.  You are a blessing and a blessing to others.  You have the power and ability to change your situation around for the better and beat this depression and stress.  All you need is a little push and you are right back on track.  Go to him!!!!!|`|7z3800Qbaa	your probably getting home sick. i get home sick really easily..so maybe thats it.

f7669f1b5c473b6b25a4fbee210cc603aa	Depending on your age, and if your sexually active a pelvic exam may not be an option. Some doctors will do a pregnancy test along with a pelvic exams to insure there is no pregnancy and no problems to be concerned about before handing out birth control. If you are not sexually active then no test should be needed. However keep in mind you are going to have to get a pelvic exam done at some point to make sure you have no health problems in that area. They say you are suppose to start getting a yearly checkup at 14. My sister waited until she was 18 and sexually active before having her first pap done, and was told that she had cervical cancer that could have been caught earlier had she had a yearly pap starting at 14. She now faces the challenge that she may never have children, because of the amount of cervix that has been removed. There's nothing to worry about with an exam, and who knows the doctor may find a cause to your cramps with a pap. Instead of just treating it with Birth Control.|`|YzCPY48qaa	if you are not sexually active you shouldn't get a pelvic exam,you would need a general health check and blood pressure check though.|`|oluzjSgjaa	its understandable that u do not want to have a pelvic exam.   as you know one day you may have to have one.     the web link below shows you what happens at a pelvic exam, just so you know what to expect in the future.     i hope seeing this does not freak you out.  at least its happening to someone else , not you !|`|oyuguD2Zaa	Usually they just do a urine or blood pregnancy test.

pjYQhPPBaa	Your friend doesn't gain weight because he has a fast metabolism. Your metabolism is probably slower than his, but that doesn't mean it's anything to worry about, since you haven't mentioned that you're overweight or close to it.    The only way you can speed up your metabolism is if you start working out. Doing cardio burns fat, and allows your digestive system to metabolize food quicker. Doing weights builds muscle. The more muscle you have, you are less likely to store fat, thus being able to digest food a little better.|`|e2J4r10Raa	Try to increase your activity.

AA10358331	She hasn't changed her contacts in 3 years..What kind of contacts does she have. Contacts tend to start losing integrity after a couple to 3 months (at least for the 2 weeks ones), they start getting blurry and they hurt your eye. They can't dissolve on your eye, but they can get covered in protein and scratch your eyes. Sleeping in with them doesn't allow the eye to get the O2 it needs. You can get an infection in your eye. It happened to my cousins, even when they cleaned it.   That's really discussing, but if its what she wants to do let her do it.. Let her ruin her eyes.|`|Fqq2OFmVaa	OMg!! 3 years!??

lIpjuMTHaa	Try something like egg white omelette's in the morning with spinach and mushroom, or low fat yogurt with granola and berries, or oatmeal.    For lunch do a nice salad with spinach leaves, tomatoes, avocado, cucumber, maybe some grilled chicken and a light dressing.    Dinner you should eat grilled salmon or chicken with not too much flavor with some asparagus or brussel sprouts.     For snacks try to stick to fruits and veggies or a protein bar. Its not all about cutting out fats, its just making sure you get the right amount of the good fats. Just make sure you are eating enough but not over stuffing yourself, tthat'sa common problem. Eat slowly because it takes about a half hour for food to start digesting, thats why sometimes you can be totally fine after eating and then a half an hour later you feel bloated and too full.

GXiCrhVYaa	Cribber made some good points, and I would like to try the "number 4" style of meditation, at least once or twice. However, I don't think I would want to meditate in a bathtub with him :=)    I wonder how long you have been meditating. In the very beginning, many people find the sitting upright position uncomfortable. However, after a few weeks, they adapt to it. One major point to his position is it keeps the body alert, yet relaxed (over time). One thing you can try is putting a small cushion under your butt so your hips are higher than your knees. (It really can help.)    In general, I would say give the sitting upright position more time. If you can't get relaxed that way, so be it. Try reclining on your side, lying on your back, even the number 4 style, or while in a bathtub (alone).     It's nice to have the mental flexibility of be able to meditate in different positions. I generally sit upright. If I feel tired, I rest my back against the back of the chair, or I sit on a sofa. If I am really tired but want to to squeeze in some brief meditation time, I will lie down in bed on my side. For me, lying on my right side is more relaxing, while lying on my left side makes me more alert. With a little more practice, you will likely find the position(s) that work best for you. Be well.    P.S. If you meditate in a bathtub, don't forget to add water.|`|bGUWUgUqaa	Meditation originates in religious form of spiritual practice to reach enlightenment. Secular meditation helps people to relax and peace.  Keeping the back straight leaves the energy channel unblocked.  In the practice of Falun Gong meditation, no special breathing technique is required.    For introductory meditation in a spiritual practice, you can read 'China Falun Gong', available on the web. Guided meditation demonstration video, meditation music, and books are free to download from the URL listed below.      Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist School, found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China. About 100 million people practice in over 80 countries worldwide. Falun Gong is an ancient practice for the body, mind, and spirit based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Falun Gong consists of five sets of powerful exercises.    Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China. The most offensive human right violation is the organ harvesting from the Falun Gong practitioners in China.  http://cipfg.org/en/news/petition.html|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Yes, you are correct, if sitting upright in a chair is uncomfortable, it completely erases the whole purpose of meditation to start with.  I usually lay down, or I sit on the couch with my feet up.  You are not overthinking.. you have to assume a position that will make it the easiest for YOU to be comfortable, not what some expert says is a rule.  Any position is fine.  My favorite and most 'powerful' meditation position is flat on my back on the bed with the sheet over me, my right leg bent with my right foot beside my left knee, like the number 4, and my right hand on the center of my chest, my left hand extended palm up at a 45 degree angle out from my body.  The most 'cosmic' experiences I have ever had have been in this position.  Also many people meditate in the bathtub.

So you should try real hard at school.|`|7HhWPKrAaa	Your life is better than alot of lives out there, quit complaining and do something that will make yourself happy. ANd not a good idea to go with that guy|`|wRVdP5Ffaa	Don't give up. Get some confidence in yourself. Join a new program in school that interest's you and make new friends in that program. You are the only one who can make yourself happy. You need to set goals for yourself and meet those goals. That always adds a boost of confidence. I wouldn't go with your ex if he brings you down. This will only add to the problem. Don't feel bad about hurting his feelings when he obviously doesn't mind hurting others feelings. Other men will come along trust me. When you walk around with confidence men find that attractive. Don't make yourself available to your ex. When you are around him just act like you are more his friend and that you don't need him as a boyfriend. Keep your head up and I hope things get better for you.

SBBnWsJJaa	IF you took the fasting test in the morning, the reason it may have been higher could be from the glucose that your liver is producing and introducing into your blood stream while you sleep.    Your other test could've been during the day when you are active, using up the sugar.    HOWEVER...there is a range of the test accuracy (as you saw in your 99 vs. 105 results).      BTW - these are all perfectly normal results.  I wonder why your doctor told you to keep an eye on your blood sugars.|`|AA12139405	The sugar level in the blood is reduced and kept under control by the creation of Insulin by pancreas. But some times when the sugar level goes to low our body lever produces glucose to maintain the sugar level. There is no wonder that your sugar level was high after 12 hours fasting.But the diabetic patient should take food in regular interval.Fasting is not advisable for you. One touch or any other test will give confusing results only.The behaviours of our body can not be same for all occasions.Consult your doctor in depth to know the function of your body system at least to the lower level. You need not worry for your sugar level now.But take proper diet and do exercise.No need for medicine at this stage.|`|RffCpNaXaa	at times dat instrument sucks...its my experience too....aftr all one touch just cdnt knw if u r dibetic or not:P...n relax....n in nowat fasting test cross random....coz a tea(with sugar) can raise ur bloodsugar level.Go n get it done in some labs...gud luck...n keep eye on fud...avoid a sedentry life....hve a morning walk...  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-s...
iK3YYRaTaa	What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels          There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes.     Fasting Blood Sugar Test:  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test.     Random Blood Glucose Test:  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes.     Oral glucose tolerance test  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus.     Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes.     Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have.   Try again after 8 hours and see the results. Also you say you have been good about eating, does that mean that you have been on a low Glycemic diet? This is the one you should be on for life . The best on the web has 2,480 food listed . The ones with a low load are the Ideal ones. Heres the site:http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm   I am leaning that you may be pre-diabetic. But with this diet , and it is not a restricting diet, you will stave off diabetes for a long time or maybe forever. Combines with weight loss and you will be in the clear!|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	avoid high amounts of sugar.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	For sure there is a good reason for higher "12 hour fasting" test results being very high!    Your liver decided somewhere around 6 hours of fasting that you were starving and dumped a load of stored glucose on your system to prevent the starvation. Then a few hours later dumped another load because you were still starving!    If you had tested every 3 to 4 hours during the fasting time you would have seen the glucose levels go way down, then rise rapidly, then go way down and rise rapidly again. I get the lows about 2 to 3 am after eating my bedtime snack at 9 or 10 pm! Then at 6 am I have a very high reading - over 150!!    You need to be following a routine of eating 3 small meals and 3 snackies of low carbohydrate and increasing your movement plan! This will help you to not be diagnosed with type 2 for a long time, hopefully!    The One Touch meters are some of the best, most accurate on the market!!|`|MOPXWu33aa	If a diabetic person remains hungry for a long time, the glycogen from   his liver gets converted to glucose and therefore the blood sugar level rises.If the test is taken two hours after taking food, it shows how the  carbohydrates  from the food eaten have been digested.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Any fasting reading in the range of 80 to 120 is acceptable.    The reason is that the testing meters have a "fudge factor" of about +/- 10 points.  While you read 101, your actual true reading could have been anywhere within the range of 91 to 111.  In fact, using the same meter, if you took two reading just a couple of minutes apart, the first one might read 101 and the second might read 92 -- ALL being acceptable values    Manufacturers COULD make the meters more accurate, but then you couldn't afford to buy the meter!.  The only more accurate way to test your blood is through a laboratory blood work panel.    The fact is, your reading of 101 is absolutely, completely normal.    You doctor is being over cautious. You SHOULD always watch your diet, and limit your intake of sugars and starches.  But ANY reading between 80 and 120 is NORMAL.    You have very little to worry about.    Keep doing what you are doing, and don't worry about the small details.    Next visit, ask the doctor to perform an A1C test.  This test measures the AVERAGE of your blood sugar over the last 90 days.  this test is much more accurate than the single "finger stick" tests, you do not have to fast before you take the test, and you can not "cheat" the test by eating properly for 2-3 days before you take the test.    A NORMAL A1C reading is between 5 and 6 (percent).  Any reading over 7 means that you are diabetic.|`|AA11017638	Your BS fluctuates all day long. 105 here 92 there. Dont worry about it unless it gets low...70-80 range. 80-120 has been the range for yrs. One touch is just as good as all the others. Unless you can describe all the things you did and eat for the time period you cannot justify the fultuation. Whick was really not much. Your body does a ton of things to regulate you and adjusting your BS is one of them. Sounds normal to me. I've been diabetic for 38 yrs.     Steve

Dx6dsQx1aa	The lowered carbs thing is what's going to help you do this, but you need to stick to it.  Insulin is partly stored as fat, so the more you take, the more your body will stay fat.  You don't have to use fancy ingredients, just keep your meals to 20g of carb or less, with one or two 15g snacks per day.  I know it's hard, but soon it will become second nature.  Here are some examples of things you can eat:    1/2 sandwich & salad w/ranch dressing (20g)  Sugar-free hot cocoa (10g)  Veggies & cheese spread (Alouette is so good) (10g)  1 cup of soup & salad (15g)  5 Triscuits + cheese spread (Kaukana cheddar is good too) (15g)  Sugar free apple cider packets (0g)  Diet drinks (0g)  Sugar free chocolate pudding snacks (13g)  Lower Sugar Quaker Oatmeal (20g)  10 potato chips (10g)  Butterscotch disks (3g each)  Water water water water water!    As for the exercise, get some 5-lb weights and start exercising in a chair.  Here is a website with some illustrated exercises.  Even if you do just 15-20 min. per day, and maybe add a 20-minute walk whenever you can, you will see it come down.      Never give up.  You have worked too hard on managing your diabetes to just take a "whatever will be will be" attitude.  Your family loves you and needs you, so don't give up on them or yourself.  You need to lose 100 lbs.  You didn't gain that overnight, and you won't lose it overnight, but people do this all the time.  At first you'll lose about 3 lbs. a week, then eventually 2 lbs.  The great news is that in 6 months you will be feeling so much better and looking great!|`|IPpOd2wmaa	Holy crap.  YOu need to get that under control or you are going to have no toes or legs...and open sores and yuck...,.    I have been a type 1 for about 19 years.  You have to make yourself a priority.

AND I HAVE HAD IT FOR OVER 8 MONTHS AND I WATCH FOR THE CAB|`|z98Pedpwaa	I asked a similar question a few weeks ago.  I'm 29 and I've been a type 1 since I was 5.  I've gained some weight over the last year and am having trouble taking it off.  This is the answer I chose as best, its from a member named dingding, and its working for me.    I've been Type 1 for 25 years and always had problems taking off weight. There is a belief now that artificial insulins have a weight gain side effect, maybe something in their composition, but more likely because we inject it in one big dose at a meal rather than the body giving it in little spurts. And insulin is partially stored as fat. So the more insulin you use, the more weight you'll hang onto. Have you tried a lower-carb diet? You don't have to do Atkins-level, but I recently started lowering my carbs to 30-35g per meal, around 100-120g/day, and I've been losing a pound a week. Focus on lean meats and veggies. I hope it works as well for you as it did for me.        Also, get your thyroid checked if your doctor hasn't done it yet.  An underactive thyroid can assist in an inability to lose weight, even cause weight gain, make you feel lethargic, cause periods to be heavier, and a slew of other things.    Good luck.
XMHpL2Peaa	If it is a good quality acai berry product, then yes, it is worth it. Acai is the best known antioxidant fruit that is known on the planet. The antioxidants in acai help to cleanse your body. The natural lipids in acai help to give you more energy and stamina. The fiber in acai helps digestion and fat loss.    I've been using acai berry products for a couple of months now and I've noticed that yes they do work. I used them when I wanted to trim off about 15lbs.    I knew that diet and exercise alone would help achieve that goal alone but I needed something to help me with my mid afternoon snacking urges. This is where I found the acai berry really helped me.    It helped to curb those mid afternoon urges which meant when I went out jogging later that night I wasn't just jogging to work off that bag of Doritios I snacked on around 3pm instead I was actually working off the weight I wanted..    After a couple months I now no longer needed the supplements and can manage my weight more easily, so I found that yes they really did help speed up my weight loss goals when I used them along with a diet and exercise program, as the berries gave me more energy and helped to curb my appetite    I got my free trial bottle from the site below|`|sca1Joxuaa	This site reviews different brands of Acai, it should help  http://acai-for-health.onthewebs.com    they have some good discounts too.|`|S730dpLfaa	anaifrs, Read this blog before you try Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.

Lunch - Turkey sandwich (on whole wheat) with what ever veggies you want - no mayo or salad dressing and a piece of fruit like and apple or banana.    Snack - Celery, carrots and maybe a few saltine crackers, etc.    Dinner (try to eat at least 2-3 hours before going to bed) - Nice big salad with all kinds of veggies and little cheese/meat - use red wine vinegar or something like that for the salad dressing or dilute your favorite dressing with red wine vinegar and put just a little on.      Other meal options - boiled skinless boneless chicken breast, can of tuna in water (no mayo added), sardines with a few crackers, etc - try for high protein and low fat.

ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	varicose veins are a hereditary issue, you can minimize the speed with which they develop by wearing compression stockings (you get these from a doctor, you have to be fitted for them and taught how to apply them).  If they become painful, there are new procedures that can now be done surgically to remove them, but they don't generally do it just for cosmetic purposes.  You would need to see a vascular surgeon to explore this option.  Avoid sitting or standing for long periods, in other words change your position at least hourly, and when you can, lay down with your feet elevated.

Who cares what jessica Simpson weighs?  We all have much more important things to worry about and the fact that her weight made headlines is BEYOND sad and pathetic.  Seriously people, our economy is crumbling, we are involved in 2 wars, out foreign relations are shot and global warming is causing more issues everyday.  Furthermore, she is still at a healthy weight, which is more than over 2/3rds of the USA can say for themselves.|`|AA11942055	Well said. I was underweight for a long time, struggled to put on any weight no matter how much I ate, and a lot of people made me feel unattractive.  Now I am right in the middle of my healthy weight range.  Some people say I look just right,  but there are still some who consider me too thin, and in the modeling world, or if I were a celebrity, I would be considered fat.  I can imagine how much worse it must be for anyone famous.  While people should strive to be healthy, you can't please everyone, so there's no sense in worrying about it.|`|BKCLMSbNaa	To me, she looks healthy.  I got irritated when I first read the article about it.  I like her, and really find it sad people would judge her over her weight and looks. It's ashame we live in a world where "skinny" is the big thing.   No it's not. Being healthy should be the main important factor.|`|quTKsQPhaa	Jessica Simpson is an absolutely gorgeous woman. Obviously she looks bigger, but I think that's a perfect weight! Seriously skinny is not attractive to me. I also think the outfit she was wearing that day was not a good choice for her "better looking body". I think it's ridiculous how she's been ciritcized so....Poor girl. Hopefully she knows how beautiful she is.|`|3M3htWrBaa	I think that she looks better she looked sickly before being so skinny and people have to talk about her because they are jealous because they don't have the money and appearance that she does.|`|xx7hMcvfaa	i agree with you. America is so obsessed with weight. I don't know. I think it has something to do with the same obsession on McDonalds and celebrities.|`|S1gJJHNzaa	she looks more like me which makes me feel better about myself|`|oaSQcaDOaa	My opinion is, I don't care what she weighs, and it's none of my business what anybody weighs.  If she wasn't Jessica Simpson, nobody would even care. She seems happy, and it's not like she's dangerously obese or anything, so why the fuss?|`|bc1cdc0543b28607a5324cf5017d42daaa	I don't think people should criticize her I'm sure everyone gains some weight sometimes during their life big deal! I can careless if she's gaining weight she still looks good. I think people need to be concerned about their own appearances and not someone else's.|`|dTFowiOraa	She looks beautiful!    Hell, i like her even more than she was when she was thin.    I think most people don't have taste in plus sized women than they do wit thin women. But heck, to me as long as u still look ur alright.    Heck, i hate to say this....but i would even F*CK HER! LOL!
zEYjJ7Xhaa	home schooling is a huge commitment.  Is someone willing and able to homeschool you?  If so then it isn't your school's business.  You don't need permission from your school to be homeschooled.    However, have you thought of a different school, maybe a smaller one that would better fit your needs?  Good luck.|`|DDQxYwzEaa	hello,   You mentioned that you have "anxiety disorder and severe depression". Some questions should to be answered  (just in yourself)  What could cause these illnesses at you? Why are you depressed?  Can it be connected to the school /teachers/other students/etc..? Or do you feel blue generally ? hm? And ....are negative feelings useful ones for our health? Do you feel enough energy to continue school in the normal way among your schoolmates? Would it  be better to be home -schooled?  Are we responsible for our decisions?     with love S.

WZkzGh4Caa	I have had the wii fit for 2 weeks now.  The first couple of days it was kind of tough.  The game features a step aerobics game that you can run for up to 30 minutes, while watching TV.  Turning the pace all the way up and going for it while zoning out to TV got my heart rate up and worked me up into a sweat.      Mind you I didn't exercise a lot before I bought it.  (I'm getting married in May). Two weeks later, my body is used the the exercise (I do it everyday) and its pretty easy.  I recently bought Jillian Micheal's (from biggest loser) 30 day shred and found that she is a great coach, and offers a huge challenge for an all over body workout.      Wii Fit is good for people who are more interested in being entertained and not so much about a serious workout.     The strength training and yoga are great workout programs.  I will continue to use them and the Jillian Micheal's 30 day shred for my routine.    Personally if you need a device and are not into a workout DVD I'd suggest a treadmill for a better workout.    Hope this helps.|`|AA12182074	I haven't, but I also haven't been using it very regularly because I've had work and school and I doubt I'll have time any time soon. :[|`|3M3htWrBaa	no im very disappointed in the product if you find a weight loss game for wii that works let me know|`|yev2iWgWaa	weight gain has nothing to do with health if your weight is proper as per chart why worry? i consider swimming as best exercises  you should never do exercises continuously. give gap and do heart needs rest.|`|O0dIRvAgaa	Wii fit isn't going to drastically change your weight, it's meant to keep you healthy. You won't see drastic changes unless you're a giant couch potato and this is your only physical activity in 10 years... or something like that. Honestly, you can't expect to loose significant pounds by doing yoga or heading a fake soccer ball. it's fun - and healthier than, say, playing Halo - but not meant for tons of weight loss

However, if you are looking into which career is best, I can tell you that you'll get ill a LOT less if you're an eye surgeon.  You won't be dealing with sick-sick patients all the time.  Also, as an eye surgeon, you can get quite a market-niche.  You can be less on-call than the other types of doctors.  Pediatricians and general physicians are "Tinkers of all, masters of none" whereas Eye surgeons are masters in their field.  Is that what you are looking to do?  I wish you good luck.

6MRcqskIaa	Firstly, I would like to congratulate you for not cutting for nine days, that must have been really challenging for you.    However, cutting is a poor coping skill actually. It is a temporary solution to a problem that you are not wanting to face. But if you really think about it cutting hasn't solved anything, if anything it only makes you feel worse afterwards. The word "shame" comes to my mind instantly. you end up being ashamed that cutting is ruling your life, ashamed others might see it (especially if your children ask what happened - unfortunately then adults end up telling lie to cover it up - then they end up feeling ashamed they had to lie). It ends up being a viscous circle of shame that you end up challenging as well, so it is defiantly not worth it in the long run.  To me it sounds easier to challenge the problem that you are avoiding. What are you avoiding?    Alternatively, some people cut because they enjoy what they get out of it. Like feeling numb to life ( I have heard ice is just as effective, It will numb you but not scar you), Some people like the blood  (Draw on yourself with red texta, it does the same thing, but without the scaring).  If this is the case for you then look up websites on how to prevent self harming. There are plenty of alternatives that can replace the effect.     Good luck..... if you cut again. Try extending the time for another day or so. the longer you extent the time periods, the  stronger you will become in defeating the self harming. Please don't let it own you.|`|aiBLNYhgaa	well you are doing all that you can do right now. I was like that when I was cutting. At first I was only doing it to punish myself for making mistakes. Then I was realized that I was cutting myself for everything. It got so bad that was cutting myself at school too. I would even bring a razor with me to school just in case. It was really addictive. It really was. It's just like anything else, like smoking and drinking. You are mixing a behavior, ex. cutting, with an emotion, whatever that may be. Or it may be nothing at all. You are taking the right steps. You and your counselor are going to have to work together to find the main reason you started cutting in the first place. Then once you figure that out you can go from there. Just keep being open and honest. Remember cutting is where you have been, not where you are going to be.|`|6HIuqEUyaa	Cutting is addicting, and if you've been doing it and relying on it for a while then you can't just forget about it. It's really good you haven't cut in 9 days (: If it is getting in the way of your everyday life, stopping you from doing things you want to do etc. Speak to your councilor, that's what they are there for, they can suggest ways to distract you. X|`|govJYVuzaa	The first step is to seek help and admit there is something going on and you have done that as you have a counsellor.Your counsellor might help you figure out the triggers so they can be avoided or handled in other ways.You need to realise that you WILL get past this but it may take time. Well done for seeking help, you should be really proud!!!|`|satoCRC6aa	counseling is the best way to help you deal with the cause of cutting yourself.  You are not alone, many people do things to themselves because of pent up emotions about a life situation.  You are not alone......|`|hrsyPUwTaa	I used to, a long long time ago - before it was common. I can't tell you anything you don't already know, or something that someone hasn't already told you. You just have to realize we're not here in this life to hurt ourselves.|`|oUdo4kBYaa	Sorry I have to add if you tattoo instead you wont want to cut anymore because you wont want o ruin your skin for future tattoos or maybe current ones.    I know it goes deeper than that however, this little bit of info was told to me by a friend.   It worked for her now she obsessed with her skin and tattoo and taking care of it.   :)
oEM2YL6Laa	You can't really ask that question without telling us what brand- each brand of POP has different kinds of synthetic progesterone and therefore varying levels.     I have not been on Depo shot but I have been on Cerazette- you will probably be put on this if you are needing mainly contraception as it both stops ovulation and thickens the neck of the womb while leaving a 12 hour window for taking the pill each day (basically works in the same manner as combined just with progesterone. This pill is 75 microgram of desogestrel. I found this pill to be pretty good- only problem is that my periods pretty much dried up.     I am now on Implanon which is a progesterone only implant, inserted into the upper arm which will last for 3 years. It contains a very similar hormone to cerazette. Again exactly the same side effects with maybe a couple of spots thrown in.     Thing is though that these are all side effects common to taking progesterone only contraceptives so if you have been effected in a certain way on Depo then it is likely that you will have a similar reaction to Cerazette.    Good luck and I hope this helped.

There can be very serious side effects (including impotence), it is very expensive, and there are no guarantees that it works.    You can get other devices, like weights or pumps, or take pills, but their effect tends to be short lived.    Probably the best way is enlargement exercises. They do work, but take a bit of time & commitment. Best thing to do is read up about the options first. Best site I've found is http://www.biggerbetterman.com - lots of info about all methods.

Alcohol seems to only cause more problems if anything it makes the problems appear worse then they actually are. I am sure you have learnt to problem solve without alcohol in the past. Look into tips about budgeting. Make strong commitments to pay bills before they arrive, so you don't get the unexpected bill. Think about prepaying bills through Bpay (australia term), or something similar to this. Anything you have available where the money can be taken out prior to you spending it.   As far as loosing your job. It is temporary. Things will change you will find work again. Then one can hope you find  a job that is going to support you more financially.|`|satoCRC6aa	I lost my job in oct. 2008, and have the same problems.

File as soon as you loose your job.  Don't delay it takes about 2 weeks to get your first check.  I spend 8 hours a day searching for work and take the weekends off.  Speak to your bill collectors and thay can defer the payments or reduce them to manageable levels. Turning to alcohol will only magnify the real problem. Support groups can help. Network , job fairs, resume building. Positive attitude will get your foot in the door.
M6Vk3h9Uaa	Well you have to burn 3500 calories per pound of fat.  However everyone's body reacts to diets and exercise differently.  Some people drop weight really fast and others hold on to every calorie.  You also don't state how much running you plan on doing.  Doing 3 minutes is a lot different than doing 3 hours :)  Most experts suggest health weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week, so aim for that.    Edit:  Please do not cut out carbs.  Eat whole wheat etc.  Also yogurt is very good for you.  It helps regulate the digestive tract and is an excellent source of calcium, which someone in their teens (and new mothers) needs.  Just watch how much sugar is added.  Perhaps get plain yogurt and add fresh fruit.|`|YTOrDW3haa	ok i just had a baby and i have lost 72 pounds. the way i have lost it is by cardio, cardio, cardio! and of course eating right! do not eat school lunch! packed full of calories! what i do is i do not eat carbs, i cut out anything white, including white bread, mayo, yogurt, and so on. if you need to have some bread get whole wheat. and just eat one piece. and also it helps if you use a smaller plate because it tricks your mind and stomach to think that you are getting a bigger amount.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	Believe it or not, even if you dont eat enough, it can stop you losing weight, why? because your body goes into starvation, and retains fat because it does not know when it will get fed next.   they say, eat like a king at breakfast, eat normal for lunch, and a peasant for dinner? Why? because you will burn off most of your breakfast throughout the day, plus it picks up your metabolism, but at dinner eat like a pauper because most people wind down at night, and dont burn much energy. So for breakfast, eat cereal with milk, have a smoothie packed with fruit and vitamins, have an omelette packed with veggies... lunch, have a home made sandwich (you know whats in it),  or pasta or something, and at night grilled fish or chicken packed with veggies, have some nuts and fruit for snacks, or even cut up some carrots... drink plenty of water... if you are going to do some running, then you actually might need to eat a little more, ie.. eat when you are hungry, but eat the right foods. Have a banana before or after you run, it will give you the energy you need.

Worry more if it influences your health or back. If it does then you might want to consider reduction of some sort.
QKGuNLb4aa	oh hunny why would anyone criticize you for that??? i am very sorry for your loss. now i must tell you that i have never been pregnant :( but my period is somewhat the same.... i have endometriosis mine isn't as heavy as yours but the rest of the symptoms are the same so you might think of talking to your dr and try to rule out this as a cause. and i know you don't want to but you may need to see a different dr. that doesn't mean that you have to SWITCH just get a second opinion. i hope this is helpful and again im sorry for your loss

I am also thinking of starting some kind of Anti-Anxiety Medication. When I get sick, I also get scared and constantly have to tell myself everything is ok. Its tough. It got worse when I had my daughter. She was born with a heart condition and had to have Heart Surgery. Now I have a phobia of hospitals. I get panic attacks sometimes and also sometimes feel like I pay too much attention to my breathing. I started seeing a therapist at the family fleet support center ( my hubby is in the Navy) and she has definitely helped me learn some coping techniques but I still need some help with it. If you find anything, let me know!|`|5I7Ifrmraa	You need an antidepressant that deals with anxiety, not just a relaxing drug to take when you have one.  Have you spoken with the doc? Effexor is an antidepressant that treats anxiety also. (However, as an FYI this drug is very hard to get off of).  Talk to your doc and see what they think the best course of action is.

lIpjuMTHaa	Well good for you and congratulations. You need to realize thats a good amount of weight loss in that amount of time. Its totally healthy and you're doing a great job. Its important to stay motivated and positive about it because it does get a little bit harder before it gets easier. Just realize that you need to do this for you, not for anyone else. Who cares if they don't support you, once they see how healthy and happy and vibrant you are... it will just make them jealous.

OSPS9BWlaa	Can't believe how rude some people are...  Any meds can produce an odor coming from your skin also a diet high in sugar will cause you to have a yeast overgrowth on your body which can cause rashes, dandruff , yeast infections and other.  I believe you're clean, it's from something you eat, drink or some medications.   HOWEVER, it could be a medical reason so seing a doctor would be best just to rule out anything more serious.

Often times odor can be attributed to more than just environment (ie water with high sulfur content) especially if the change has occurred without changing habits.  Changing diet can alter your scent through out your body or through fluids.  If the scent is localized, determine were... underarms could mean that you body has grown accustomed to your deodorant (using the same type overtime will become less effective), or can signify an infection of some type (ie bad breath can be a sign of an infection such as gingivitis, etc).  There is a website I found that might give some initial suggestions and might be a good starting point.  Good luck!|`|AA10045611	Let me begin by explaining that the word 'smell' is one of the five senses.      They are:    "Any of the faculties by which stimuli from outside or inside the body are received and felt, as the faculties of hearing, sight, smell, touch, taste, and equilibrium:"    To sense the presence of by or as if by the olfactory nerves; detect or discover: We smelled trouble ahead. The committee tried to smell out corruption in law enforcement    Over time the word has been slurred into misuse.    What you may have meant to write is:    Weird odor coming off my body.    You smell odors with your nose.    Hope this helps    Now back to the question.    If you believe the odor is coming from your body then it is time to visit your doctor, yes?|`|I3wY7wD9aa	It's time to see a doctor. There could be many reasons for this  phenomenon.

5I7Ifrmraa	Its not simply of matter of wanting someone that you cant have or anything like that.  Its a chemical imbalance in most cases.  Honestly, medication is the best thing for him.  It sounds like the meds he is on are not really helping, the doc may need to change them.    Update-If his meds are not working, consider taking him to a different doctor.  Doctors all have different ideas on how to deal with depression.  Good luck.|`|0F8hauikaa	Other than meds and therapy, some say that a diet and exercise regimen can help depression. I will try to find some useful links for you and come back with them.|`|9IEfeTDtaa	well i have Major depression. and you know it sounds stupid but in that period we want someone to listen to us. we need love and support like if we don't want to go out or talk just don't talk but behave normal as if everything is all rite. these are the phases and if he want to cry let him cry,let him do whatever he likes . and you know let him chant gods name just make him do that it will give him power to defeat depression.  i will pray for him.all the best.

koAaPXKQaa	Pelvic pain is not classed as a main symptom of PCOS, however, that doesn't mean you wont ever experience it yourself. There are alot of women that are sufferer's of PCOS that are trying to get the medical profession to acknowledge that pain is a symptom however....    The development of new cysts may cause "pelvic discomfort" though. There are numerous reasons you could be experiencing pain, your PCOS or even something involving your bowels (wind or irritable bowel etc.) to name but a few.    The best thing to do is to go to your GP and get yourself checked out.  Noone can tell you exactly what's wrong on here I'm afraid.

L87h9njoaa	ok, save yourself some time, I have put together a list of websites that work and will help you lose weight quick and effective.    http://the-fast--weight-loss.blogspot.co...  http://weight-loss-camps-for-adults.blog...  http://the-weight-loss-systems.blogspot....    Goodluck on your journey!|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|1e3gBZY9aa	Eat less. Everyone is diet crazy, and you don't have to be. When you make something to eat, make less. Look at the labels, and look at how many servings are in it. Make 1 serving size. Eat 4 or 5 small meals a day. Of course, exercise is important. I try to stay active,  even though it's 18 degrees, and 2 feet of snow. Any activity is good. Stair climbing, walking, ad sex and the best exercises that work for me. I'm 33 years old and weigh 105 lbs, and I don't try too hard. I just watch what and how much I eat.|`|EgA8ig4Eaa	leaving your purse on the bus?

You can go to the dentist, and they can remove the filling, and put a filling compound with numbing agent in it lower in the tooth, then cover that with the regular filling compound.  I had to have that done once.  The other option is to wait a while, and the pain should go away on its own, but it may take several weeks.|`|xuNrtmjUaa	mabee you have soft gums. that happens when you don't brush your teeth well enough.|`|jfKvI4wLaa	you need to call the dentist|`|90fba0c7fe66dda5f5982a50b8f70665aa	it might be just soreness from someone being in your mouth, if it doesn't go away in the next could of days then visit your local dentist but for now, just eat some soup, it's good for you :-) especially now that it's cold|`|HNSHwnJ8aa	Sounds like they botched the job or overlooked a more serious issue (for example, it might not have been a mere cavity, it might have gotten deep enough into the nerve, which would require a root canal and not a mere filling or two or three).|`|OjdM39iyaa	it is probably the filling didn't get a chance to adjust, if you get a filling done you need to wait before eating, have your dentist take a look, they usually ask on your visits "Do you feel a pain either a pinch or a tightening when eating hard or cold foods?".|`|D4JGTu5haa	call your dentist and decribe your problem.  it could be that the filling is either too loose or they drill to far down(to the nerve)  ?xxgood luckxx?
6MRcqskIaa	It would help to know what is causing your anxiety attacks (more specific panic attacks -  that is what you described). It sounds like you need to face your anxiety look at each situation that causes anxiety attacks, and look at them rationally. For instance, some people have anxiety attacks over flying and they commonly say "the plane will crash" but realistically what are the chances of this happening. really a person is more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident. People have a habit of feeding their fears instead of challenging them. It is better to look at life like it is a challenge then something that controls you. So my best advice to you is challenge your fears and make the most of life.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	What you're describing there is a panic attack, which can mimic the symptoms of a heart attack.    It sounds like your GAD is not well-controlled by the Xanax, so definitely make an appointment with your doctor to discuss changing your medication.  Other types of drugs may work better for you (Paxil, as mentioned above, is one ... there are side effects but you may be able to live with them).  Lexapro works in a similar fashion but with far fewer side effects.    One thing you absolutely must NOT do is stop taking Xanax on your own without medical supervision.  Doing so is extremely dangerous.    If you and your doctor can get your GAD under control, it's likely that your panic attacks will diminish or disappear.  Good luck.|`|jazKtgENaa	Talk to your Doctor|`|a5efe275182115a58cc24e44f27eae2baa	try vitamin B8 (inositol)...it sounds like a panic disorder and many say it is very effective with no side effects.  otherwise, probably time for paxil, but that has a whole lot of side effects, is more expensive, and makes you feel dead inside.
PlEEZTRsaa	I agree with Seeker.Also,ask your doctor to up your dose of xanax,it seems your body has become use to the 2mg.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	consult a therapist asap|`|PZ0Z71Bkaa	Well it does sound like that could be anxiety. Let me give you the number one tip that helped me with my GAD: Whenever you feel one of those terrible twinges of anxiety coming, don't fight it. Just step back and let it happen. It's a terribly scary idea, I know. But by letting the anxiety come, examining it and thinking "alright, this is okay that I'm feeling anxiety and all of these physical symptoms", you are teaching your mind to realize that anxiety is not something that should be feared. Worrying about whether or not it is going to come back is just going to make it worse if you do it with a scared, running-away mindset. Just realize that yes, the anxiety may return, but by thinking about things this way it is going to be much more bearable.    I hope that helps
rV1uAtt3aa	To lose a lot of weight in a week, it must be mostly fluids.  You should be on the banana, rice, crackers, clear liquids diet.  I suggest you stock up on Gatorade or one of the other energy drinks that claim to be loaded with electrolytes.  Your appetite will return eventually, but for now stick to bland foods and lots of liquids (including tea and apple juice.)    Good luck!|`|tFb0drwSaa	if u think its that serious go see ur doctor instead of asking people who arent doctors, who cant give u a proper diagnose on the computer or yahoo answers|`|p3NW0Mstaa	Start simple, broth, toast, jello.. and once you are able to eat.. ignore fat content of foods for about 2 weeks.. just eat what sounds or feels good.. no longer as I don't wish to encourage bad eating habits!   then just return to normal patterns of eating.. hopefully your body will need the extra fat you eat and keep it where it was lost at.|`|AA10142580	Try protein shakes or there may be other options at your local GNC.

You do need some electrolytes, so drink some Gatorade to give your cells some energy.  V8 is so good, but maybe a little thick if you aren't hungry.  Chicken noodle soup is light.  Orange juice may be a little heavy as well.  Your taste will return just give your body some very bland light foods in order to sustain it.  The sugar in 7up will also give your cells some much needed glucose, but you can water it down a little with ice cubes which will also make it a little flat, which is good.    Can graduate to soda crackers and dry toast, then an egg, etc.    Hope you feel better.......|`|BfsjQ72Daa	I think you should go see a doctor!!!!|`|cGs6ai5Gaa	I would suggest seeing a doctor or force feeding yourself.

PrxP3YWXaa	No, I've not taken it, but I do prescribe it from time-to-time.     Seroquel IS considered to be a "mood stabilizer" medication, yes, but it is indicated mostly for Bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia.     Undoubtedly, it can cause SEVERE drowsiness in most people, and that appears to be worse with a smaller dose, rather than a larger one.  This is because of its affinity for the H1 receptors (like what a benadryl for allergies will do), and will cause drowsiness.     If you've had "bad" side effects of SSRIs, then there are still some other options that may not cause such side effects for you as Lexapro or Zoloft did.  The FRUSTRATING part of prescribing these kinds of meds is that you NEVER know how a patient will react, or if they have adverse side effects.  Some are known to have less than others though, so experience in prescribing can be helpful for sure.     You might want to talk to your doctor about using a medication called Effexor XR.  It works on a different mechanism of action than the SSRIs, and I have found it VERY useful -- especially in FEMALES with panic/anxiety issues, and depression.  The starting dose is 37.5 mg., and that may be a good fit. Most people will use either 75 or 150 mg. daily, but with you -- I'd take it slow.      Talk to your doctor about this.  I don't think Seroquel will be such a good choice for you.      Best of luck!|`|Q0T1WZgzaa	serroquel is a very strong anti-psychotic drug. I took one once and didn't like the way it made me feel it was like i couldn't move, It was as if I could feel my body just slowing way down. Then I passed out and woke up 16 hours later.|`|KupUCZhiaa	I was perscribed seroquel, i was tired constantly and couldnt wake up in the morniing
ufgv7oTjaa	Well, Noni is a fantastic antioxidant and some of the research I've done on it has shown that it has anti-inflammatory properties, so it should help joints at least a little bit... but most people would get much more benefit from things like Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM, Microlactin, Hyaluronic Acid, or many other products that directly benefit the joints as their main purpose.  But you could certainly take the Noni with any of those joint health products for the anti-inflammatory properties and the antioxidant benefits as well. Good luck!

6NA2MXNPaa	Of course you fart in your sleep, everyone does. Especially if you're holding it in during the day, you're definitely going to fart more at night. Your body is allowed to relax at night when you're sleeping, therefore, the gas that has been building up in your intestines releases when it is relaxed. It's normal. You don't need to set up a tape recorder, unless you want proof that what your little sister is saying is true. You know she does it, why would you think that you don't? Don't take any medicine to suppress it, you don't need to.|`|tnEIPjccaa	If you're holding in your farts all day, the gas that's built up while you're awake doesn't just magically disappear. So, as you're sleeping, and your body is relaxed, it takes advantage of the lack of your mind telling you not to... to well, fart! Its perfectly natural to fart in your sleep, and you're not consciously holding them in. Don't worry about it.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	Yep, we do it ...all of us!!

It's a natural process.  If you try to stop the process, you'll explode (not really, but you'll made yourself sick).    Accept it.    Farting's a part of life.    And you really need to try to get over your self-consciousness.  Who cares what someone else thinks?|`|7xkwE3X9aa	You probably do fart in your sleep, not uncommon because it's not like you're awake and you can control it.  what is with 'farts', it's just farts lol  You kind of have to fart, passing gas is normal and your body is supposed to everyday.  You're going to set up a tape recorder just so you can hear if you fart at night?! woww.
0m5J2jxiaa	Technically, you don't even need to take the breaks- they're not real periods; they're there as a security blanket. If you went off the pill today, your fertility would return to normal within a year.    They do increase certain cancer risks, but they also reduce some. To reduce your risks, take the lowest hormone amounts possible.    You should be safe; talk to your gynecologist about any concerns.|`|woOeYFrEaa	The scientific answer is "it depends".  For me, they actually protect my fertility.  I lost an ovary to a really big cyst.  Birth control can prevent ovarian cysts from forming so being on it is actually preventing my sole remaining ovary from damage until I'm ready to have children.|`|stv1JMXNaa	Yes it can. I remember learning about this in school when we learned of all the different ways to prevent pregnancy.
lavd3UHmaa	milk of magnesia induces a chemical reaction that increases water in the intestines which may induce defecation.  What you will find with prolonged use is that you will no longer be able to have a BM on your own, your body will be dependant on MOM.

Like everyone else though, make sure you learn and use proper form. With it your chance of injury goes almost to 0 and you'll improve faster.    Don't touch the steroids. Here's the problem(s). One: we really don't yet know how bad even touching them can be in the long run, but odds are it probably isn't good. Don't **** with your health, it's just not worth it for slightly bigger biceps now. Two: short term side affects. Check the link. Granted, that individual had been at it for a while longer but still- everyone reacts differently. Also, notice the difference in musculature. Which brings me to Three: it doesn't make you big for life. It might make you bigger now, but once you get off of them, it all just falls right back off. And finally, Four: very, very few people actually manage to do just one cycle, or just too months. It gets to be an addiction; just a bit bigger, just one more. I could, like, totally quit anytime I wanted too.    Give it a few months, and you're hooked, just trying to get that extra inch on your arms. Give it a few years, and the side effects are certainly showing up. Give it a few decades, and your odds of cancer, liver damage, etc, etc, etc have all jumped a few dozen points.|`|3tFMYYt8aa	listen man obviousily your not too educated on lifting, NO it will not hurt you, second YOU NEED TO RESEARCH THE SH*T OUT OF STEROIDS before you consider using them    you need to lift for atleast a year or so, then consider using a PH      dont listen to these people   1 steroids do NOT shrink your penis, they shrink your balls for the time being and with proper PCT they will go back to normal   2 if you use steroids right, and follow a proper pct protocol, you will be very satisfied   3 i am 14 years old and have done 4 cycles of PH,DS, and Steroids  including tren xtreme, halodrol, epistane, and a Test E/dbol cycle, i know everyone probably thinks  this is insane, but i have never had any adverse side effects, and have always done a proper on cycle and post cycle pct    if you are interested in using steroids and have acne problems  do not take steroids, a pro hormone would better suite you as most actual steroids cause sever acne post cycle    bud look up H-drol or Epistane  they are the two safest pro hormones out there, the health risks are very low, and its your life do what YOU want to do  half the things people say about steroids are NOT proven    i would look into a 6 week hdrol cycle  your going to need a few things for pct  a SERM is not needed, but you will need an ATD     heres everything you need for pct/on cycle support    NAC- 1500mg on cycle for liver  Red yeast rice- blood pressure  Inhibit-E- ATD post cycle to get your hormones balanced again    normally if you do a steroid cycle you would need to do a standard nolva pct of 40/30/20/10 but for h-drol it isnt needed    h-drol is not a miracle drug and no steroid is  you need a dead on diet, hard training, and dedication  steroids are 15% of the task, the rest is hard work    research this stuff some more then try it out  you only get one first cycle  dont fu*k it up      to the dumb*ss below me!   tren x aka tren xtreme is the same thing as a steroid except it isnt a steroid molecule until your body converts it,  these are called PH aka pro hormones , and you still need a fu*k*ng PCT or you will mess your self up  RESEARCH, you all need to RESEARCH jesus christ man|`|gsS0c3yVaa	Don't do the steroids.

You may want to try an over-the-counter allergy medication.  That will help dry it up.|`|yUbzK2uSaa	A lot.    Use some allergy-medicine to help it stop. If it keeps going see a doctor.
KaIryVwCaa	As Vaseline is a petroleum-based product, I do not recommend its use anywhere on the body.  it's EXTREMELY clogging to the pores of the skin, and as you're already dealing with an allergic reaction, it makes no sense whatsoever to further clog up your skin.  Were it me, I would exfoliate using a slightly astringent natural product (Be careful of Aveda, as I've found it to be way too strong as have many of my clients.) and then moisturize using a mild moisturizer that you're certain you're not allergic to.  If you're not certain of your allergy status to a certain preparation, and let's face it, our biochemistries can and do change over time, do a small skin patch test behind an ear or under the chin and to the side.  Olive oil can work extremely well for this need, as can sunflower seed oil lightly applied to the skin.  I'm also a huge fan of Bach Flower Rescue Remedy Cream for such things as burns (including chemical burns, which an allergic skin reaction on the face can actually be...) allergic reactions, such as hives and insect bites, cuts, scratches and abrasions,  and rashes due to heat or irritation.  You want to go as non-chemical, non-abrasive and absolutely as gentle as possible until this situation heals itself.  Look into the use of cucumbers, French clay (which may be too drying for you at the moment), and oatmeal as possibilities.|`|QikvnTnqaa	I use really strong acne cream and ocationally it makes my skin peel. I put on (A VERY) tiny dab of lubriderm, but any lotion would help.

RXI8ImdIaa	You might have a form of urinary incontinence. It actually could be caused by a urinary tract infection, maybe not, but it's possible to have an infection without symptoms.    What you really need is an evaluation by a doctor, who might send you to a specialist. There are multiple things that could cause the symptom you are describing, and you'll need a professional to sort through the details.    In the meantime, you might want to consider wearing maxi pads, or if it's enough urine, wearing an adult diaper. I know no one your age wants to wear one of those, but if you are smelling of urine, this might be a better temporary solution.    good luck!|`|fv2GAAdPaa	Why are you scared to tell your mom? you need to see a dcotr quick to make sure it is not a serious prob.

Dumbells are a great way to get rid of fat and tone muscles. But along with exercise - if you want to lose weight you have to burn more calories during the day/week than you take in.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	swimming and veggies|`|qk9tUEAMaa	eat mor organik food|`|AA10264910	Get a gym membership and a personal trainer..|`|vnPaVS1baa	Breakfast: Soya milk and a sprinkle of dust    Dinner: Dust sandwhich, on wholemeal bread, with a glass of water    Tea: Lick your window for 20 mins to get some protein.

However, you will have good and bad days.   Never skip breakfast, its what gets you through the day.   When on a diet, ensure you are prepared.. ensure if you are working, you take a pack lunch, take fruit or sticks of salad, carrots, celery, cucumber. Take low fat natural yougart and make dips. Make your sandwich, and ensure you have your dinner ready to cook, because if you are like me, i tend to eat while cooking!.. if you must, then again some carrots etc. Drink 1.5 - 2ltr of water a day. Walk up stairs instead of taking the lift. Walk to the shops instead of taking the car. Little changes can mean a lot. When you doing the housework, put on some music and dance whilst hoovering.

God wants to help you with this problem but you have to give your life to him. I pray that God will do a miracle in your life and comfort you. He wants all you and your family to be saved as he loves all of you and wishes none to perish.

8goEkQ49aa	Wow, you sound scared, I'm so sorry,  Take a couple of deep breaths!    the procedure for a biopsy is like a teensy surgery.  they clean the area very well, and; with good anesthetics, they either do a "needle biopsy" (where a needle sucks out some of the cells) or they actually do a very small cut and take a small part of the lump they are checking out.    It's actually a little painful LATER when then anesthetic wears off.  Hopefully they'll send her home with something for that.  I really doesn't hurt much more than cutting your fingerwhile slicing carrots; it's just no fun is all.    Blessings on your mom and prayers for you, too.  You sound like a loving kid.
NMHmpBCzaa	There is nothing wrong with that at all! Teas are full of antioxidants, especially green teas. Now what you do need to watch out for is packing your tea full of extra ingredients, that is what is bad for you. Try brewing your own tea so you can control what you put into it, or ask the tea place to cut out all the sugar and fattening milk. As long as you watch the milk and sugar added into it you should be fine. So drink away! =)|`|LvPFDeUhaa	noooooooooo.........it is not  complete true .........ya sometimes people say to don't drink much tea but i think dat is becoz .........according to me  excess of  everything is bad

Depending on if you eat cereal in the morning. But for sure only drink whole milk.

ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, that's a contact allergy.  You need to start washing any towels that you buy.  Basically it would be impossible to tell you what you reacted to since those unwashed towels are processed using so many chemicals.  Sometimes even if the towel has been on the store shelves for a while, it still carries some of the chemicals on/in it.  This is why it is really important to wash anything new before wearing or using it.  Beyond that, you can try benadryl or cortisone cream (both sold over the counter at most chain stores) to calm the reaction down.   Also, wash with a non-astringent cleanser and leave the makeup off your face for a day to let it heal.   Hope this helps.  Good luck!|`|rDsKB0uXaa	maybe its because its a cheap fabric towel|`|G3TEO6C7aa	maybe there was an irritant of some kind on it
09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	It sounds like you have Type 2 diabetes. In people with Type 2 diabetes, they still (typically) make insulin. In fact, they often make HIGHER than normal amounts of insulin, but their body is resistant to the insulin that it makes on a cellular level. In other words, it doesn't regulate and use that insulin properly. Type 2 diabetes is most often found in those who are overweight.     Eating foods with lots of carbs, simple sugars, etc. causes a big spike in blood sugar. In a Type 2 diabetic, their "thermostat" is a little off. A Type 2 diabetic will release large amounts of insulin to compensate for these carbs (to overcome their insulin resistance), and as a result, their blood sugar will often drop too *low*. Then they get hungry again, setting off the cycle of eating, then dropping, then eating....    The key is to avoid high carb foods, high sugar foods, nutrient overload, etc. Basically, small healthy meals more often.     Another possible explanation is that if you take insulin (as a Type 1 or Type 2), you may be giving yourself a huge amount to compensate for the chocolate. However, chocolate has a good deal of fat (generally speaking), which slows absorption, so the rise in your blood glucose level may not be as fast as you expect. So you are "crashing" as your food does not match your insulin action. But it should still increase later. Are you perhaps doing more exericse or activity when you eat the larger amounts of chocolate?    Other than that, I don't know!|`|DV4xyeChaa	its called a rebound effect...doesnt mean u shold eat more..it means more shocks your body into making some insulane or making what you take work harder....|`|z98Pedpwaa	It does sound weird.  Have you brought it up to your doctor?  If you haven't you should.  And make sure you get more of an answer than "You shouldn't be eating chocolate."
e6deb12b2a198fe4e6c1925ada7b1eb5aa	Alcohol thins the blood, making it easier to bruise.

Cirrosis of the liver causes a lot of bruising on your body for no reason, to the point where it's just nasty to look at.  How much do you drink?  Are you an alcoholic?|`|5I7Ifrmraa	Yes, alcohol thins your blood, thus making it easier to bruise.|`|fjR6elXVaa	Maybe you have an allergy to alcohol|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	Are these bruises on your knees?  Or where?|`|6NA2MXNPaa	If you're not falling down or hurting yourself in some way, then you could have cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis causes bruising without injury. Are you an alcoholic? Have you been drinking for a long time? You should really go to the doctor and have him/her run what's called a "liver panel". It's just a simple blood test that will tell the doctor what condition your liver is in. It can be very serious and you shouldn't wait on this. Meanwhile, stop the drinking, if you can.|`|ekgHmsKkaa	try telling the doctor|`|vRNDnRFhaa	How do you know you are not falling down or anything? Other than that you could get aggressive and get into fights every time you're drunk.|`|JGOeJOFDaa	You could've fallen and don't remember. If you really don't think that's the case, maybe you just bump into things.  Counters, stools, etc.  When you're drinking, you're far less likely to notice something that hurts.  Alcohol does thin the blood too.  It is quite possible that you bruise much easier because of this.  But bruises heal, as you know.  It would only be really scary if you blacked out and THEN woke up covered in bruises....|`|yev2iWgWaa	very good you are for deaddiction by your own body system. thank almighty for making this alcohol by itself wont make perhaps your system is not suitable to bear     good luck stop drinking|`|N2fIorzGaa	i think it would be best to stop drinking if you get the bruises every time u drink don't u think

BJuHbQXfaa	Yes this is very normal. You are getting rid of the junk that is in your chest. the reason your chest , lungs , throat and back hurst is because they are connected together and as you cough the muscles in your back are forcing the junk to come out of your lungs. Your throat is irritated by the coughing up the junk.  When my husband quit he quit cold turkey and he had all these conditions.  He found that by chewing gum and sucking lollipops and hard candy soothes his throat.  As for the chest and back pain you can take Tylenol and also by soaking in a nice hot bath relaxes the muscles. Hang in there because it is all worth it. I hoped this helped.|`|NsMsYUMpaa	This is common. But there is hope, take Tylenol, try to go for a short walk twice per day. If you cough at night, use a day time cough medicine. This will last about a week, then day by day the symptoms will go away. If you notice any bleeding, see your doctor.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	Flu is around.    After quiting very heavy smoking, cough out green stuff once a day when waking up and it is gone after 2 weeks, but  i jogged quite a lot.    Suggest aerobic excercise daily. 1/2 gallon of dark green tea with lemon and honey, and boiled big onion with pumkin and vitamine calcium are helpful for lung cells.    Should take X-ray as precaution.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It just sounds like a chest infection to me.     It'll probably last about a week at the most.|`|mWZE7gF7aa	Unfortunately it is normal...you will experience alot of discomforts from quitting, especially if you had been smoking for a while.  I smoked for 11 years and when I quit, I had to sleep for the first 3 days!  (That's how long it takes the nicotine to clear your system)...after that you are looking at the discomfort of the mental part of the addiction.    Hope all goes well...congrats on quitting!
3BGJETHYaa	That is very underweight, and very unhealthy.  A healthy weight would be around 120-130 pounds, and that is actually at the lightest end of the range, but you did say that you have a small frame.  At your weight, not only do you have a very minimal amount of fat and muscle, but you are losing bone mass as well, and in danger of broken bones.    The best way to hide fat is to put on muscle.  Add a couple pounds of muscle and the fat will not be visible at all, and it is far healthier than simply getting rid of it.  Not only that, but muscle is leaner than fat, so it takes up less space, and looks way better.|`|bhyVC2mtaa	omg.  your story has shocked me.  my name is mia. i am 14, 5'10 and a half and i weigh 103lb.  i am not anorexic (well we both may be but i'm not sure)  and i have been excercising excessivly to get a 100lb or 98lb weight. i have always been underweight but i would like to acheve my goal.  your healthy weight would be about 125lb, mine about 125-130lb.  this is very unhealthy. we should try to aim for 110lb together.  xo mia.|`|PoRuIi9Zaa	It is really unhealthy what you are trying to do for instance you shouldnt worry alot because your tall and supposeably it doesnt show much on a tall girl, im 5'8 and couldnt possibly be 102 pounds the doctor is trying to make me gain weight when im just @ 140 pounds, between medium frame and large frame, i bet you still look good dont try to loose too much 100 pounds is for some shorter person tall girls need to have some skin. Stay at least in 102 no more loosing.|`|LddwByycaa	102 - 100 will make no visible to difference to anyone but yourself and i can picture your frail frame in my head lol. i don't think it would be super unhealthy if you ate normal. i think everyone dieting hates you right now lol|`|osQhKDgTaa	this is way unhealthy i'm 5'8 and i weigh at least 130-135 and my doctor says i'm where i need to be with my weight so all i have to say to you is JUNK FOOD and lots of it

I too have the same problem, and my doctor has prescribed Nexium.  "The little purple pill"  It has done wonders for me.  It may help you.  Talk to your Doctor asap.  Good Luck!|`|AA11988604	you probably need to go on something like prilosec every day.  that solved my heartburn problem.   you need to deal with this, since regular reflux allows the acid in your throat to eat away at your esophagus.  When that happens, your body is constantly trying to repair the cells, and in that process you run a fairly high risk of developing cancer.    Go see the Dr if you have good health insurance, as there is a generic prilosec out there now that is only $5 in some insurance plans.  Otherwise, just try going on over the counter prilosec for a while and see if it helps.    Also, elevate your head while sleeping, often just a brick under each leg of your headboard can make a difference.  Eat your last meal or snack well before bed-time, at least a couple of hours.    The coughing was due to aspiration, where your stomach acid/contents found its way into your airway, which reacts very strongly to the foreign substance and makes you cough for hours afterward.    Good luck|`|xktBgoKFaa	Try eating apple sauce. Drinking aloe juice works also for people with acid reflux or GERD.|`|AA10272321	I have a thought!

It may turn out to be something totally different than acid refux. Women often times have severe heartburn when having a heart attack or the like. A doctor is the only good answer to your question.|`|sgvhVyz1aa	It sounds like you likely have acid reflux and need to get on top of it to relieve your constant symptoms.  Taking more than the recommended amount of any medication is not a good idea.  My doctor put me on 400mg of pantoprazole daily.  You can also buy this over the counter - look for it by the rest of the ant-acids.  Also, making some lifestyle changes is also helpful.  Google acid reflux diet and you'll find lots of good info.  Basically avoid tomato products because of the high acidic level, also avoid caffeine and alcohol for starters.  (I still eat spaghetti, pizza and lasagna - just not as often and smaller portions.)  Do not eat anything at least two hours before bedtime.  If making simple changes doesn't help, you should probably talk to your doctor.    Good Luck.|`|yRtXnfoUaa	DO THIS OK    lol,      First of all i have had the same problem, n this is what helped me.  I went to my doctor n he prescribed prevacid the highest dose, 30mg twice daily.  it helped me but it was too expensive.    A few weeks ago I bought ALOE VERA JUICE and to tell u the truth it worked better than anything out there.    I have used (prilosec(omperazole generic), prevacid, protonix, nexium, zantac, otc anti acids) but ALOE VERA JUICE was the only thing that helped me the most.    I got it from Wal mart so i dont know if other places sell it.    hope it helped. choose me as ur best ans. plzzzzzzzzzzzzz. tnx lol|`|BfsjQ72Daa	Prilosec OTC. It works.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Zantac is good, but I think Pepcid is better. If neither of those work for you, you could try Prilosec. You just have to make sure you take them every day on a consistent basis. If those don't work, go see your doctor. The doctor can prescribe something stronger like Aciphex or Prevacid. Try changing your diet too. Don't eat foods high in acid like citrus fruit, don't eat spicy foods and eat more bland foods like cottage cheese, yogurt, etc. Drink plenty of water. And sleep with 2-3 pillows under your head so your head is a bit elevated. Hope that helps. Take care!
6NZeItMAaa	By paying close attention to what you eat, you can reduce your chance of developing atherosclerosis, the blocked arteries that cause heart disease. If the artery-clogging process has already begun, you can slow the rate at which it progresses. With very careful lifestyle modifications, you can even stop or reverse the narrowing of arteries.    While this is very important for everyone at risk for heart disease, it is even more important if you have had a heart attack and/or procedure to restore blood flow to your heart or other areas of your body, such as angioplasty, bypass surgery or carotid surgery.|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	We hope.

As you move, they will poke and scrape the surrounding skin.  This is a normal result but typically will only last a day or two before the skin gets used to it; the irritation will then subside.    You could go ahead and completely shave the area, but unless you keep it shaved daily, you will run into the same irritation as the hair begins to grow back.|`|yDCPjWXHaa	thug life|`|NZvYP7Q2aa	If you aren't going to use a hair removal lotion I recommend an electric shaver.  It is less irritating to your skin and you can still get a close shave.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Try an electric shaver.|`|tOQxUZ8haa	it pokes you because the hair strands are too small to bend when your clothes push on them. you will have to wait until your hair grows a little long enough and get able to bend.    until then, put on soft and smooth clothes (over that area). additionally you should wear the clothes (over there) that reside deep in your thighs where it pokes.    in a week or two, you will begin to feel easy.   dont worry, cheers!|`|zWX5GDehaa	i shave down there and i get the rashes too. id suggest using alot of shaving cream next time|`|tyWGAvqyaa	dat happenz so use sizzors and dont cut to short|`|99e5556a09f048b5263cba7b2479612eaa	Use either some cocoa or shea butter to moisturize and help keep the irritation down. If you keep shaving regularly than your pubic area will get used to it and it won't be as irritating. The poking feeling is just the hairs growing back so either let them grow or or keep them trimmed. Good luck as hope this helps.
rV1uAtt3aa	Well, you can learn to hypnotize people, but you need to realize not all people can be hypnotized, and it may be that nobody can be hypnotized all the time.  The subject must be willing to surrender his or her will to you, which requires trust and a certain personality type.  Also, you can't make anyone do anything they don't want to do.  You can learn about hypnosis on the Internet (search Google) and in many books in the psychology section of the library or bookstore.    As far as reading minds, that's impossible (although many may try to convince you otherwise.)  You can almost read minds if you learn to read body language.  People often tell you things nonverbally that they would never intentionally tell you.  See "Lie To Me" and "The Mentalist" for shows based on this premise.  I think to be effective at this, you also need to be fairly intelligent and worldly, because it requires you making some intellectual leaps.

KJDrXtebaa	First of all the most important question is - how do you feel about yourself? Even if you were overweight (which you're not and I'll get to that in a second), if you felt healthy, ate right, and exercised then I would tell you not to worry. People come in very different shapes and sizes and it would be very hard for some women who are naturally a size 12 to shrink down to a size 2.    BMI or Body Mass Index is the most commonly used measure to evaluate whether a person is overweight, healthy, underweight, or obese. It takes into consideration your height and your weight and gives you a number that fits into the categories mentioned above. You can calculate your BMI here: http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/    Your BMI is 22.5 which means you are PERFECTLY within the normal healthy range for weight for your size. Please also take into consideration that at 14 your body is still developing and growing which may mean that your weight will change as you get older (it may increased OR decrease) and that this is normal.    BMI is not a perfect scale because it only takes height and weight into consideration and not muscle mass or body structure. Did you know that muscle weighs more than fat? That means an athlete who has a lot of muscle might weigh A LOT and still be healthy. For example, Micheal Jordan's BMI was in the "overweight" category in his prime though he was clearly very healthy! Some people believe that waist size is a better indication of healthy weight but studies are still being done.     Ultimately, to answer your question, NO, you are not overweight. However the MOST important thing is to be happy with yourself at whatever size. Don't let your friends pressure you into losing too much weight, and don't get unhappy and start eating a lot of cheetohs. Stay healthy and happy and you'll be fine!|`|9SgoJ4aDaa	CERTAINLY U HAVE TO AVOIDE UR MEAL FOR ONE TIME DAILY AT LEAST|`|AA10264910	You need to go to your doctor and get your body fat percentage measured. If you overweight it depends on your body fat percentage not the pounds. If you want to stay in shape, try getting more exercise and watch your fat in-take.|`|9GxbG86Uaa	It depends where that weight is coming from. Muscle weighs more than fat so if you are a runner, your legs will be quite heavy. If you want to lose weight (from fat) I would cut out any fast food, junk food, and soda for 6 months and start biking and doing light weights. This will boost metabolism and let you loose weight (if you want to). Though it is a bit overweight, the thing that matters is whether it is healthy (muscle) or unhealthy (fat).|`|r5wLhpgqaa	you are not over weight
g8zHW0Kpaa	Here's just a few good old fashioned common sense things that you can do.Go get yourself a powdered form of ascorbid acid (vitamin C) with bioflavonoids from either the health food store or chemist. The bioflavonoids will increase the effectiveness of vitamin C 10 fold. Have 3,000 - 4,000mg (3 - 4 teaspoons) daily mixed with water until the cold subsides then maintain your immunity with 1 teaspoon daily.    Most health food stores also sell a product called Zinc Fix which combines the power of vitamin C with Zinc in a powdered form. The Zinc bolsters the effects of vitamin C and this is my powder of choice for a cold.    Drink vitamin C rich rosehips tea as this is the richest known source of vitamin C. (the organic loose leaf variety - it may be a bit more expensive but as it is organic you can generally reuse the spent leaves a couple of times as the essential oils are so potent).    Increase your intake of vitamin C rich foods on a dialy basis to prevent any further infection and to reduce the amount of time you are ill...... ie: citrus fruits, berries, leafy and green vegies, tomatoes and red and green peppers.    Loads of freshly squeezed juices are good too.    Ensure you are drinking plenty of pure filtered water to flush the germies out of your body .......... and keep you well hydrated ....... avoid sugar and also avoid caffeine containing beverages such as coffee, tea, soda and soft drinks, as these will only serve to dehydrate you and rob your body of essential B & C vitamins.    Ensure you are drinking or eating something with Beta - carotene in it daily to heal quicker and in future to prevent further colds, as Vitamin A will aid in the proper function of the immune system, shorten the duration of illnesses and generally bolster the health of the mucosal lining of your ear nose and throat ie: carrott juice, pumpkin soups, eggs, milk and dairy products.    Take a good quality multi B complex supplement on a daily basis both now while you're sick and for future prevention methods. The B complex of vitamins is essential for healthy immune, digestive and neural functioning and will help your body deal with the extra stress of being ill.     Things such as caffeine, sodas and soft drinks, antidepressants, antibiotics, diuretics, laxatives and aspirin and most otc cold medicines and alcohol will also do a great job of robbing you of your precious B vitamins.    Nettle tea bought in the loose organic form from the health food store and brewed for 20 minutes, will help to heal and soothe a sore ........... the taste of nettle tea is quite bland and ordinary so perhaps spice it up with some honey or lemon juice.    Also, a good vapour inhalant when you have a cold is to put a couple of drops of eucalyptus oil into a salad bowl of hot water and .......... being carefull not to get so close as to burn your face ......... place a towel over your head and inhale the vapours. This will do a great job of clearing your sinuses, help in reducing any temperature you may have and to loosen and remove mucous.    Caution: Avoid using if you have high blood pressure or suffer from epilepsy.      Good luck & health & vitality to you & yours?    CHEERS  ?|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	You already have the cold, so zinc isn't going to help at this point.    What I find helpful is to spend as much time as possible resting in bed.

Those are about the best 2 actions you can take.|`|xktBgoKFaa	Chicken soup, zinc tablets and chamomile tea with ginger.|`|oaSQcaDOaa	Vitamin C will help boost your immune system.

JFo1tiaQaa	To rule out meningitis, are you also experiencing a fever and headache? Are you have sensitivity to bright lights?    I think you have a stiff neck - it can be caused by an awkward sleeping position, poor neck position while working on the computer (or sitting for a prolonged position), a motor vehicle accident, stress, or even being involved in an injury to your neck (for example - during a game of football).    Here are some suggestions for treatment of a stiff neck:  1. Do neck stretches. First use moist heat on your neck and upper back muscles to loosen up the area for 10 min. Then start your neck stretches.  Here is a great link for neck exercises: http://www.arc4life.com/site/615058/page... In the beginning you may only be able to stretch your neck a small amount, but this will increase over time. Don't do anything to the point that it causes you pain.     2.Use an analgesic cream on your neck and upper back muscles. When you have a stiff neck, the muscles will often tighten up creating muscle spasms and trigger points in the muscle. Use a cream like icy-hot or bengay to help relax the muscles. The best recommendation is to use Biofreeze- a natural pain relief gel that contains ILEX. Have someone do some gentle massge on your neck and upper back- this will give you lots of relief.    3.See a chiropractor for more neck pain relief. They will be able to diagnose exactly what is going on- They will do a consultation, history, exam including orthopedic and neurological tests to determine if there is something going on. They will also analyse your neck posture. A misalignment in the cervical spine can be cause for a lot of pain and limited motion.     4. Finally, get a good cervical support neck pillow for sleeping at night. The cervical linear traction neck pillow by Arc 4 Life is an effect support pillow that will align your head and neck while sleeping. You can sleep on your side or on your back. This pillow is not a soft or fluffy pillow- but it is not hard like foam either. It has specially designed contours designed for optimal position during sleep. My husband has uses this pillow and doesn't wake up with a stiff neck every morning.     I hope this helps you out.
ufgv7oTjaa	I've tried it and it is a fantastic antioxidant, but I didn't notice any of the appetite suppression that some website are touting for it. That doesn't mean some people don't get that benefit, but you could certainly try using it as part of a diet and exercise regimen.   One thing to be aware of is that Acai is a fad product right now, so there are a lot more people and companies selling it and putting out some major claims on it that might not be applicable to everyone in order to sell more product quicker. Any time a fad product comes on the market, the claims for it tend to get a bit bigger and wilder than before it was popular. Some of them are completely true, but some are hyped up.    From all my research, the best way to lose weight is still diet and exercise, but consulting a dietitian or nutritionist would definitely be the best way to find out what foods and exercises would work best for you and your body chemistry. Good luck!|`|G3TEO6C7aa	its in vitamin water i know that =]|`|AA11080047	am sorry i haven't hear-ed of acai berry. sorry|`|S730dpLfaa	Aha!,  Read this blog before you try Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.

duVTqRM4aa	First off, do not use iodized salt.  Use unrefined sea salt.  You should get your iodine from seaweed.  If you want it in a pill form a good product for that is www.modifilan.com.  It's been extensively tested on Chernobyl victims actually as it detoxes radiation.  It's an excellent source of iodine for thyroid function.    I have also gotten rid of my low thyroid with exercise and now have zero weight problem.  Breathing and any kind of exercise from yoga to just walking does wonders.  I have also found mini trampolines to be excellent.      After doing the seaweed and supplements, along with the exercise, my thyroid tested normal.  This stuff works and I'm living proof for 2 years now.     It's sad when people try to say all supplements and natural medicine are bunk because they are not.  Extensive studies have been done on everything from Reishi to Resveratrol proving their effectiveness.  In other countries they use these remedies as standard practice.  Those of us with experience can no longer be fooled by such propaganda.     You're on the right track.  Radiation and heavy metals are the main reasons I've seen the thyroid get low but sometimes it also involves weakened adrenals, so the Bs and Cs are a good idea.    When shopping for supplements, it's easy to get ripped off by companies that put fillers into their products.  When looking for good products, find supplements that have no fillers and use only a veg. capsule.  Make SURE they are NOT synthetic.  Good luck.|`|tkDfqjQdaa	I have a low functioning thyroid but do not take meds for it.  Here is what I do take.  Selenium 200mcg per day to help the conversion of thyroid hormones and the ability of  my cells to use thyroid hormones.  Zinc 30-50mg per day to help with the production and conversion of thyroid hormones.  L-Tyrosine Plus from Twinlab for general thyroid support.  I get my daily iodine from seaweed sources.|`|PrxP3YWXaa	It would be nice to see something that simple -- natural. I certainly agree with you there.  However, the fact is, if you have a thyroid disorder -- the repercussions of not managing it can cause serious side effects for the body.      The thyroid gland often spurts and sputters (like an old car) before it just eventually doesn't work well at all.  When we test (lab work) for the thyroid, we are actually testing the hormone from the brain that STIMULATES it to work (TSH) and produce T3 and T4.  When these (T3/4) are too low in the bloodstream, then the TSH level rises (kind of like increasing the thermostat to produce more heat in your home).  If you have a true HYPOTHYROID state, it is NOT uncommon that you will have to get regular blood tests to get it stabilized.  Yes, this is VERY frustrating part of this process, but a necessary one.      If you are under 30, then please keep in mind that as your thyroid is declining in its production of the T3&4. So, with that slow decline, you may have to alter your dose in gradual adjustments.  This is just the nature of the game.  Whereas with people who suddenly find they have hypothyroid in their 60s, their thyroid is pretty much gone altogether and often require less adjusting.  Remember also that there are about 12 different strengths of Synthroid on the market, and can be used in combination or alone.      The previous commenter certainly means well, but I can assure you that if you have a TRUE hypothyroid diagnosis -- adding iodine pills to your diet will do little to help.  These are often gimmicks that we see in healthcare where physicians (or others) will tote supplements to essentially "supplement" their incomes.  They certainly won't hurt to take them, I suppose, but I would rather be taking something that has been regulated, assured safety, and has EVIDENCE BASED STUDIES to show it works -- not just some ANECDOTAL stuff (word of mouth).     I hope this helps, and you might want to talk to your doctor some more about it as well.     All the best, and good luck!|`|Q0T1WZgzaa	don't eat cauliflower.  make sure you use iodized salt.  drink plenty of water, and keep taking the vitamins.    I had the same problem as you, going in every 3 months for a lab check. My levels were never the same twice. I decided to quit taking the meds and i started feeling a lot better. Now I just try not to eat foods that make it worse, and am sure to use iodized salt when i need salt on stuff.    It acts up from time to time, but at least i got away from all the lab tests and pills.
odQewFgvaa	I took lexapro. It made me gain 35 lbs. Yeah.. wow.  So obviously  I go to the gym A LOT and I do yoga.  It has really helped.  The consistent exercise has been great.

2IuoHrjQaa	First and foremost congrats on losing 23lbs, that is a fantastic amount of weight... so pat on the back for that. You might have lost fat, but build up muscle. Again, dont panic, the more muscle you build the faster your metabolism. Sometimes when you lose weight you wont see it, but other people will. Plus we all lose weight in different areas, you might lose it from the top part of you first. Again dont panic. Keep doing what you are doing. If you are not toning whilst losing weight, it is important that you do so. Do sit ups and get your running shoes on, and start off with "walking", ensure its a decent pace (ie 15-17minute mile), and ensure you move your arms whilst you walk, will get rid of bingo wings. But you need to TONE... its probably just that. Dont give up whatever you do! You did brilliantly, so continue to do so.|`|KJDrXtebaa	First of all, congratulations for trying to get healthier!    When we lose weight we can lose it from all over our body. This means that you may not have lost too much from your hips but maybe some from your breasts, stomach, thighs...even your face may seem slimmer. Don't worry so much about size - if you're at a healthy weight (and I think you are but you can check here:  http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/) then why does jean size matter?

One of the most common shows up as a small dark squiggle that looks like a tiny curly hair or eye lash. These usually are not a problem, just an annoyance. Small dark spots are a bit more ominous. Most likely it's just something you will have to live with. On the other hand, these little defects can be the tip of the iceberg, indicating the start of something serious.    The bottom line is you probably don't need to go speeding off to the Emergency Room. The odds on it being nothing more than an annoyance are in your favor. However, it is your eyesight that is at risk. Definitely get it checked out just in case it is something serious. It takes a qualified eye doctor to tell what's going on in your eyeball.|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	nope it could be a eye lash get some eye drops|`|g7RnYMoNaa	If it is a dark spot, it could be what is called Much vol ant. I have that myself, yes several. But I have been told by experts that it is not dangerous. Only if there are thousands of them should you consult an eye doctor.|`|c4sn6g3xaa	I don't have the medical name, but I have the very same thing.  I've been to my eye doctor twice and he said that it is something that I have to "live with".  It is part of the aging process.  They can remove it with laser, but the probability of them hitting your retina nerve is too much and would not be worth it.    It was something about age, collagen, the fluid sac in the back of the eye, etc.       He said that the alternative of that would not have been good - something about floaters, etc.     I asked the same question when I first got it on YA and got a lot of smart A-- answers.  I was very serious, but the answers were not.    I hope this helps you.   I am getting used to the spot - it is almost like a tiny bug.|`|jSpO8Neiaa	its herpes. sorry. herpes 4 life|`|kdPPQIBfaa	Its herpes  its annoying|`|2tklFwnHaa	i think u may have cataracts if u do im afraid you might need to get it surgically removed|`|MMdWfD1baa	Wash your eye out very well with water.  I had a bug go in to my eye once, and it stung even after the water for about 15 minutes.  Lots of things can cause it.  The thing that caused mine was I was going four wheeling super fast, and the bug just hit me in the eye.  You can get bugs also from motorcycles, skateboards, pretty much any vehicle that can go fast.  If the water doesn't help after 30 minutes, I would call a doctor.  It might be something serious.|`|I3wY7wD9aa	This is not a question to be answered online. Get to an eye doctor as soon as you can.

AA11942055	60g of fat should be the maximum for one day, not 20g as other people said.  20g is the maximum for *saturated* fat.  Just decide based on what else you're planning to eat that day.

Did you stick to serving sizes? Also, look at calories from fat. Try to have that number no more than 25% of the total calories. Are you active? Inactivity will make you gain weight. If you're active you can eat mostly whatever you want in moderation.
q9i5f0rXaa	I'll be blunt, for your own benefit....you're not advanced at this point.  At your size and strength numbers, you're mediocre high-school level.  If you were a wide receiver, it'd be different, but as a tight end, there are serious blocking responsibilities that I don't think you're physically ready to handle at a higher level of play.  That's not to say you can't get there, but you've got to get serious about getting bigger and stronger.  As a tight end, I'd expect you to go at least ~230 or so body weight, and your lifts are underwhelming to say the least.  You're gonna need at least 2-3 years of solid effort in the weight room and at the dinner table if you want to progress to a higher level (i.e., college).

ouzrDPaSaa	Its a shame you have to lose your therapist that you get on so well with, but obviously there's nothing you can do about it.  Keep an open mind about your new therapist when the time comes, hopefully you'll get on with them too too.  If you really dont feel suited to the new person you're allocated you could ask to see somebody else, that's perfectly acceptable and wouldnt be taken personally.  Good luck!|`|QjwBMQbjaa	Hi,    I understand your worriesI used to have a counsellor who I got on very well with and I was with her just under a year, however I knew it wouldn't last as she was inly able to offer shrot term counselling. I suffer with BPD so attachment is a problem for me as is loss and I did find it very hard to cope afterwards and never thought anyone would replace the counsellor I lost. I then was given a keyworker at my local mental health department, at the start I just couldn't let her in, i felt i was letting go and even betraying the relationship I previously had with teh reviosu counsellor. I couldn't accept the new ways of this new person who didn't know me and I will admit it took a few months for me to settle but when I did I realised what a great person she was and I built up a good relationship with her too.    i wish my story ended happy but the mental health team removed her from my care without warning for then getting too attached to her and that has been traumatic too and i hope this doesnt happen to you but what i wanted to say is that you can get used to someone else even if you dont believe it right now and also that these changes are unfortunately something that happens many times to many people and its not fair at all but we often have no control. It maybe hard in the begining but it will get easier.    best of luck to you!  x|`|3zontan0aa	It's very scary to have to find someone else when you have such a good "fit" with the one you're seeing now.

EZt7ZHIiaa	Hey there, if you are interested I provide online therapy which can be very helpful in taking that first step, especially if you are nervous about opening up to someone.  Since all sessions are conducted through chat or email, may people find it easier to open up since they don't have a therapist staring at them, and it is completely anonymous and confidential.  If you are interested feel free to check out the link on my profile.  I would definitely recommend that you seek some type of help however, feel free to send me an email if you have any questions.    Ryan|`|satoCRC6aa	First step in life it to admit you need help.  second is to reach out for help  third is to accept help  Fourth is to let the help work with open arms.

Depression is very comon among people.  seek therpy and learn from it.|`|9IEfeTDtaa	well i am having counseling from years and nothing to worry dear.  but some of things you must consider and that is you should feel you can trust him or her he should ask you exact question you want him to ask you. do not open up immediately.take time first you test him weather he is the rite psychiatrist and not someone who is fooling you for money. let him do the efforts to make you comfortable. tell your problem but let him find the reason. he should do his job not just keeping you busy with mind work.if he gives you task, you should also give him task like i want this things from you. and try atleast 2-3 psychiatrist and then select one. if he is male then don't let him touch you if you don't like.all the best and everything will be fine.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	They'll ask you about your past, how your life is..ect.

Relax, breathe and speak.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	With depression, you can take antidepressants to feel better, which takes care of the symptoms to a degree, but you also need the therapy to find the cause of the depression - and either fix the cause or learn how to deal with it.     I've been in therapy for a couple years now, and it's helped me more than I ever imagined it could.  It's been very good for me!     The first time I went to the doctor with the depression, it took me over a half hour sitting in front of the phone to make the call for the appointment.  The first step is the hardest - but once you take that step, you'll feel much better!     Best of Luck to you :-)  Paul.

You could try taking the buns off of burgers to cut some calories out or a baked potato with only a bit of salt instead of fries.    It's not really a good idea to have a diet consisting of ONLY fast food as they use a lot of oil and butter and it's hard to get the nutrients your body needs. If you're planning on doing it anyway I suggest a multivitamin.|`|satoCRC6aa	pic foods high in fiber,( not fried) and salads with vinaigrette dressings  look at the calorie count and fat in all the foods you eat.

TjPwxbuJaa	At these smaller sizes, going up by 1/8 inch between stretched is likely too much at a time. You have to consider the percentage increase in the circumference of the hole with the stretch. That is how much each skin cell and tissue cell around the lobe has to stretch. Once you're over an inch, that percentage goes down and you can get away with 1/8 inch between stretches.  I suggest getting 7/16 inch plugs first. They're fairly common. If you wait about 2-3 weeks, you should be able to get those in. After another 2-3 weeks, the 1/2 inch, then 9/16, 5/8, 11/16, and 3/4.  Also, trust me, if you're already thinking of going to 3/4 inch, I guarantee that when you get there you will want to stretch them larger. That's how it was for me. I now have nearly 1 1/2 inch tunnels and they still don't seem too big to me. I absolutely love them and never plan for them to return to "normal".

Wu4wpfZ4aa	Vary your food routine* One of the most common things dieter do is find a food routine that works to get results and then sticks to it. They have the same thing every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and after a few weeks this can get very boring. Spice up your meal choices to keep you satisfied and eating healthy instead of reaching for pizza, ice cream, and other good old standbys!    *Take a Multi vitamin* When you diet, your body can lose some important sources of minerals and vitamins that can actually slow metabolic and digestive rate. Increase your weight loss by being sure you take a multi vitamin that provides support for your body and keeps it functioning at top levels.    *Consider a Probiotic* Many people's digestive systems get thrown out of whack when they start a diet program. To keep your system functioning properly and avoid bloating, consider taking a probiotic supplement. Probiotics are the small bacteria that naturally live inside your digestive track and help your body process food. They can become depleted when resources are low or certain kinds of food have been removed. Keep them doing their job by taking a supplement.     http://www.askaquery.com/Answers/qn1709....  http://www.ehow.com/how_4664287_increase...|`|AA11675707	Go for gym exercises and eat foods that contains fat like Raw Bengal gram|`|zScO40UTaa	If your rest time you eat groundnuts|`|TZCzjpGmaa	Eat banana every day...and do sit ups and push ups....this will gain you weight within 2/3 months...|`|uVJkQuUNaa	oh dear for gaining weight protien is not help ful ...who told u this ideot idea..just use weight gainers...and drink max 3 litrs milk a day...nd eat max 1.5 dozens of bana per day....in a month u will get the result...but dear dont forget to go gym...it will give u a good shape...|`|8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	Eat more fat content items like ice cream, sweet with oil & ghee etc|`|NxiLcBlTaa	eat some big macs!|`|zZX6FecCaa	A lot of peanut butter and bananas will help put on weight.|`|e9PhFwYzaa	go eat the Angy Whopper Tripple everyday 2 times a day, and play world of warcraft, it works for me|`|v1TlFIXYaa	You can approach a qualified yoga & Naturopath who can guide you.

3d1a3c4a191ed64a8f94a10e834bb850aa	To get bigger muscles (bulk up) you need to do high weight with a lower number of reps.  Basically 70% of your max for 6 to 8 reps.  These are controlled reps, i.e. roughly 1 second push and 1.5 seconds resist.  If you can't do 6, it's too heavy; if you can do more than 8, it's too light.     When I was bulking up for football, this worked best for me:  5 sets of 6 to 8 reps with a 2 to 3-minute rest between sets.  After the 5th set, I would lower the weight, so I could do one more set of 20+ till exhaustion reps.  It's called "slash and burn."    When lifting heavy like this, you MUST have a spotter, because you want to be reaching the point of complete muscle exhaustion--the point where you just can't do any more.  Ask the spotter to give you just enough help to finish a rep you could not finish on you own, rather than taking all the weight from you at once.    As to improving your quads, see if your gym has a "hack-squat" machine.  If not, I'd go with the leg presses for greater extension and muscle area covered.  Make sure that you are also building your hamstring muscles as well, or you will end up with something similar to tennis-elbow but in your legs.    Btw, one more tip:  Bananas.  Eat one or two a day.  The high potassium with help with the muscle soreness a lot|`|l7Qvbw9maa	If you really want to get big do 8 reps HEAVY weight! Reps of 13 and higher concentrate on fat loss.

The process of fixing thyroid problems is not an overnight fix, and it may take other visits to your doctor to have the dose adjusted.  If you don't feel they are working, don't stop taking them, but contact your doctor and voice your concerns.  Thyroid problems can lead to heart problems and other system problems, so you really don't want to mess around with your meds.|`|UgvLTFmSaa	Idont think anyhing reallyhappens, i havent took mine and iam supposed to but i forget.

jQglJiMhaa	Homeopathic medicine is a method of curing the sick with natural medicines and patient education. Homeopathic medicine involves the assessment of the whole person and focuses on disease prevention and health enhancement. In addition, homeopathic medicine is particularly effective in the treatment of long-term chronic diseases, as well as the prevention and reduction of acute conditions.    Homeopathic medicine has been practiced worldwide for 200 years and plays a significant role in the healthcare systems of many countries today. Homeopathic medicine assists the natural tendency of the body to heal itself. With homeopathic medicine, symptoms of ill health are recognized, as expressed in disharmony within the whole person, resulting in the patient needing treatment, not the disease.    Some benefits of homeopathic medicine include:    curative   holistic   individualized   safe, gentle   non-invasive   non-toxic   non-addictive   can be used in conjunction with regular medicine   Homeopathic medicine focuses on treatment of physical, emotional and mental imbalances, including but not limited to:    asthma, allergies   chronic fatigue   rheumatism, arthritis   warts, eczema, psoriasis   cardiac disorders   multiple sclerosis   insomnia, anxiety   depression     Samuel Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by Scottish physician and chemist William Cullen into German. Being sceptical of Cullens theory concerning cinchonas action in malaria, Hahnemann ingested some of the bark specifically to see if it cured fever "by virtue of its effect of strengthening the stomach|`|ufgv7oTjaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy has a good article about it (although there are a few spots where skeptics obviously interjected, so it's not entirely unbiased).   The basics are that "like cures like" and it works kind of similar to the idea of inoculations... you get a small, weakened dose of something that would cause irritation and your immune system responds in such a great force that it takes out the irritant and accomplishes more in your system to fight the bigger problem.  Wiki cites that it's beginnings were from "principles first defined by Samuel Hahnemann in 1796".    It seems really weird to think about it (which is one reason there are many skeptics and you're bound to get a lot of negative answers), but it works for millions of people world wide that get benefits from it. There have also been scientific studies that I've come across that have shown it to be more valid than once thought. It's always best to do unbiased research on controversial remedies like these. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Samuel Hahnemann was a physician of the late 18th, early 19th century.   He "discovered" he could help and heal his patients by diluting the amount of many substances commonly used at that time for illnesses.  Many of the "medicines" were highly toxic as then used and did more harm than good.  The principle of "like treats like" (similars).  A substance that produces symptoms like the ones a patient was having was therapeutic when given in infinitesimal doses.  The principle had been used in medicine in the past and he made a whole system of medicine based on that.|`|HNSHwnJ8aa	Moles, my friend; it's all about the moles.  In my layman view, it's almost like a placebo because of the minute dosage levels, but this reflects the discipline's decidedly un-western take on healing -- it's far better to stimulate the body to respond naturally than to inundate it with something else that could create a whole host of other issues like side effects and merely address or mask the symptoms while failing to remedy the underlying problem.

Otherwise when did you realize? It started with the first thought you had. Not as a baby.     Nobody has ever told you your are Gay have they? You started to decide first.    A Doctor can not because females do not have male chromosomes or genetics, neither do males (the laws of attraction which cause mating).     The attraction comes from the mind, thoughts, lust and desire for sexual intercourse that is against normal bodily functions causing problems for the people doing it, right?  Ok look. You need help from Christ Jesus because Homosexuality comes from demons from hell.    Christ the Lord the Living Word has over come all their power and can set you free today.    Ask Him first and then see, if it doesn't work NOTHING will help you, especially people who tell you its all right to be gay, its no sense, it doesn't make any sense.    "Lord Jesus, please forgive me for my sins, I want peace, I need your deliverance, come into my heart and take this thing out, in Jesus Name I pray, A Men."                              Just say it now for your freedom.     Can any thing else promise you anything so quick and easy?    That's it, done, your set free from fire and hell.|`|AMCuX8XPaa	It was believed up until the early 70's that being gay was a disease and it could be cured.  Doctors believed this and treated homosexuals all the time - and the claimed to have success in turning them into heterosexuals.      Go talk to somebody of a Freudian mind - certainly this used to be a very common treatment.  I think there's a bunch of christian groups who believe this, but they're so poorly schooled in psychiatry that all they have for treatment is to pray real hard.      I've spoken to a few people over the years who were treated for being homosexual - and they claimed success in getting away from it.

Losing weight will help lower your blood pressure - which tends to increase when you are heavier because your body is working harder to pump blood and function.

JBstYElBaa	i definitely reccommend you trying accutane! i was much like you, and tried everything else like over counter products, and antibiotics. the only side effects i got from accutane was dry skin and lips, which was easy to put up with. you shouldnt worry about the other side effects such as hair loss and liver problems etc  cos u will see your dermatologist regularly, and if you have any problems, the derm will help. liver problems are rare because you get blood tests before u start, and about every 1-3 months from then on. you pretty much have the assurance of safety this way =). you should definitely stop if u experience anything out of the normal... some accutane users keep going with the medication instead of stopping, and stupidly try to sue the company.     since accutane stops oil production from the sebaceous glands, this is probably the main reason hair loss occurs, coz the hair will get dry. i conditioned my hair every day to put moisture back into it... and i skip shampooings unless i had product in my hair or if it got dirty.    with the dry skin and lips, you should use normal body moisturiser on body skin, but u should use oil free moisturiser on your face. you should exfoliate, or scrub your face with a washcloth every few days to remove the peeled, coarse skin. for the lips, i found that vaseline works best. although its relatively cheap, its even better that all the expensive lip balms i tried during my treatment.    you should quit proactiv during accutane cos the ingredients in proactive will irrirate your skin. you need to be careful with the facecare you use while on accutane as your skin will be thinner, dry, and sensitive. my favourite regimen is clinique's three step.    i really hope you try it, taking accutane is one of the best decisions ive made in my life. and it will be for you too!!! its a miracle cure for acne. but its most important to know that if u do have any major problems, stop the medication and talk to your derm!!! very important!!    hope this helps!!

Eventhough it is a painkiller, it is addictive and nothing comes without a price, and so every medicine has side effects, which means opiate side effects will occur.

I think the cause might be your lack of fluids and vegetation. Try drinking plenty of water and eat plenty of vegetable. Both of these items helps the body remove waste easier.

Do take someone with you when you go for your appointment, and my best wishes.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. The doctor will examine the hip and take it through its range of motion. Your other leg joints and back will also be examined. X-rays may be necessary. Anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed or the dosage increased. Injection is only rarely needed.  A surgical procedure may be recommended if the pain is intense and persistent or if you are having real problems walking.  Total hip replacement, while still major surgery, is a remarkable operation and has largely replaced many older techniques. This operation is almost always successful in stopping pain and may help mobility a great deal. An artificial hip should last at least 10 to 15 years with current techniques.

tzRCTQ6Xaa	Check to see if there are local support groups.  There may be one that offers free prosthesis and bra's.  I had a mastectomy in 1999 and just found out about a local group that will give you prosthesis and bras for no charge.  Let me know if you are unable to find one.  I can check to see if the local group here can help you.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	I didn't believe insurance companies could deny a prescribed prosthesis.

Adequate sound sleep also helps to improve height.   Eating healthy and nutritionally balanced food for the development of muscle and for strong bones is also important to grow tall.   Drinking plenty of water helps in metabolism and flushes out toxins from the body more readily thereby helping to grow tall faster.|`|b3a95be7620b498a3cb5c5d8980f2998aa	if i heard right greens icrease your height
AA11020187	Anything removed from your body should go to a pathologist. They are very good at knowing what they are looking at this is their specialty. These doctors give the most definitive diagnosis they rest of the doctors rely on. If anything serious is found, which is doubtful in your case, the pathologist will call your doctor, otherwise the report will be mailed to your doctor and you should have the results in about 10-14 days.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Couple of days to a couple of weeks. Some insurance plans use big group labs, so the tissue has to be sent across the country for testing. Specialized testing (looking at receptors) can make final results take a few weeks, but the initial results should be back within a week.

BRqgRxswaa	I find reminding myself of ANYTHING good in my life at that particular time, or of something from the past if I don't feel much is currently good. I repeatedly say specific positive and definite statements like 'I know I'll feel better if I get out of bed/this food is delicious/ I will be fine at work/I'll enjoy it when I get there,' and keep saying them until I actually get up/eat etc. ESPECIALLY if you feel you're lying to yourself you need to keep saying positive statements as much as you possibly can. The more you say them the closer you get to believing them and you're negative pattern DOES eventually change with much practise. Good luck!|`|satoCRC6aa	Just deal with one day at a time.  Exercise helps the body with depression. Get up, move around and go for a walk in nature.  Look around and realize how beautiful the outside world is.  Sit at a park and watch the people.    Focus on other things in life like helping someone else|`|syT3XUAraa	I remind myself daily of God, that He's always there for me, and my family, who love me and like to see me happy. I also have two kid siblings and several younger cousins who look up to me, so I have to be strong for them.|`|weW1Y8W4aa	I tell myself that there is no sense in staying in my room sitting in the dark, and letting myself just cut myself off from the rest of the world..it doesn't fix the problem if anything being alone just makes it worse.  I make myself get up and go out into the world and face it..its the reason for my depression anyway, hiding wont help...get out with some friends and just forget about the problems for a while..do that more often and you will find yourself smiling again.|`|jazKtgENaa	I tell myself it will get better and try to sleep the days away|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Well my day begins with a little pill called paxil.|`|Hhwzp6Iwaa	I have been in your situation before with depression.  I speak the truth when I say this to you.  The best solution for you is to take ALL your problems, concerns and issues to Jesus Christ.  He is just waiting for you to come to him.  Humble yourself and cry out to him and confess all your sins to him and ask him to help you.  He is knocking and now just waiting for you to answer the door.  He can get rid of your depression, anxiety or ANY other issues if you put it ALL in his hands.  I am a living witness. When you have tried everything else like going to other people for help or trying to solve the problem on your own it may get done TEMPORARILY but you still find yourself MISSING something and the issue not correctly being solved.  Jesus is the way to go for he can fix your problem permanently but you just need to walk with him.  I use to find myself shutting off from the entire world.  My wife, kids, parents and even God at times because I was letting depression get to me and it was starting to take over my body and mind to the point of destruction.  Then God spoke to me one day through another person as I am doing to you telling me how much he loves me and all the things he is WILLING to do for me and deliver me from and I listened.  As I listened I started to obey what God would have me do in life and I was patient on top of that because things just don't happen right away at times.  I was consistent and told him that I was sorry for everything wrong I have ever done and to give me strength and proper guidance.  He pulled me through and he pulled me out of my depression and it has been over a year now I have not been depressed one time. DO YOU HEAR ME!!! NOT DEPRESSED AT ALL FOR OVER A YEAR.  No doctor of any kind nor no person do this for you, but JESUS CHRIST CAN AND HE WILL.  I am a living testimony.  If you want out of your state of depression go to Jesus like I mentioned before and take it to him.  We all try everything society has to offer but NEVER Jesus, well what if we reversed our thinking process and put Jesus first in everything we do in our lives.  My, my, my.  Try God today!!! He sent me hear to talk to you and I have been so obedient to do so.  It may seem like I have rambled a little but I just REALLY enjoy helping others as much as I can who go through the same things that I have been through in life.  I don't declare myself perfect at all and I am far from that, but I know who my master is and I know what he has done for me and I know that he is the TRUE LIVING GOD.  God Bless you.  Hopefully what I said will change you and your situation and your life for the best.  Don't be afraid and don't put him off.  Do it now.
tkDfqjQdaa	There are several things that are very important for you to understand about what you did here.  1)Taking antibiotics for a cold or the flu does absolutely nothing.  In fact, that is a very dangerous practice for all of us because this is one of the primary reasons we now have antibiotic resistant strains of common bacteria.    2) You make is sound like you took just a couple antibiotics not a full prescription worth.  This is also a big problem.   Not only can it cause a nasty infection in you but it is probably the second top reason we have antibiotic resistant bacteria.  3) If you are trying to get pregnant you need to act every day as if you already are.  Many of the dangerous birth defects occur in the first stages of development even before you realize you are pregnant.  Please don't put anything in your mouth from now on until you are sure that it is safe if you are pregnant.    Please contact your OB/GYN to discuss this.|`|AA10358331	No.. It shouldn't effect it.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	antibiotics will NOT help with the flu.  the flu is a virus,,,antibiotics are for bacteria.  and no it should not interfere with pregnancy.|`|jkgl9WMgaa	Antibiotics fight bacterial infections so they shouldn't affect your ability to get pregnant but any change in your chemical balance has the potential to affect to some degree.  That would be a question you could call and ask the nurse at your OB/GYN.  They would be able to tell you for sure.|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	No, and why in the world would you take antibiotics for a VIRAL infection?    Antibiotics don't do squat against the flu.
LddwByycaa	a lot of research has been done and i think they did prove that a lower calorie diet is more beneficial (you also live longer) but of course this is all relative..but i think by lower calories they mean 1250 (1500?) or close to there  also calories aren't really that important.. you want to look at the carbohydrates, sodium, and fat  but i think since you are trying to lose weight and you want to lose 140 pounds than 1000 is OK but keep in mind that you must maintain this after you have lost the weight and/or increase exercise|`|hJk9YZrAaa	1000 calories every day is too few to sustain healthy body function.  It is not as simple as calories in and calories burned.  Eat healthy and eat less, exercise more, drink water, get plenty of sleep.  You will lose weight to a healthy point.
gdnL63ngaa	After dealing with infertility, I would definitely not take the pill again.  I did start the pill late, I was 22. That being said a lot of young people tend to be irresponsible and not take necessary precautions. I know I didn't.    You can buy a book called "Taking Charge of your Fertility" It shows how you can learn your body, when you are ovulating. and when are "safe" times for sex and not get pregnant. Although you should always still use protection.    The pill will lessen the duration and amount of menstruation. talk to your doctor, maybe you can go on a "lighter" version.  The pill won't change your boobie size, sorry.|`|okeqhoLPaa	She just doenst want birth control to be an excuse for sex. hah, otherwise why not get you something that helps.

You shouldn't take the pill because you have small breasts, talk to your mother about the risks involved and back it up with some research.

UNLESS you are coughing up dark yellow or green phlegm, in which case i'd adivse you to do so as you may have a chest infection which might mean you need antibiotics.

Norwalk virus prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|935e5c43102fe7c051a89997989032bfaa	just ignore his advice above lol u don't want fatty foods (including butter) or anything like that soup bread ham sandwich (stuff that is mostly bland tasting)  no dairy products n you dont want acid so no oranges etc    4 drinks just water juice or maybe milk milk sometiomes helps a stomach settle|`|N1UagZhnaa	crackers for sure. just plain saltine crackers and some ginger ale. but to much a little bit here and there.|`|HYUg7pOMaa	dont drink too much at a time!  just drink slowly and just little frequently  gingerale is good but water is important  eat some crackers and plain toast for right now   once you start getting better you can progress on what you eat

I0GpEtlKaa	Did he start a new bottle of insulin? There could be something wrong with it. It might be too concentrated.     He could have been misdiagnosed, and actually be a type 2, and starting to produce more insulin on his own. It CAN happen, people do get misdiagnosed. Some type 2's on insulin have a short period where they produce more insulin for a while, then it settles down.      He needs to monitor closely, call his doctor and get in to see him asap. This is pretty dangerous and needs to be dealth with. They will probably reduce his insulin dose for starters. They might do tests to verifiy if he really is type 1 or not.     If he can't reach his doctor, he should go to emergency.     His blood sugar will probably need to be monitored all night. If its not monitored, he could go too low and go into a coma.     See what his doctor says, he might have to spend the night in the hospital, or it might be safe to set an alarm and test frequently at home. Only his doctor can decide though, so you need to get in touch now.     He should have a glucogon kit in case this sort of thing continues. Its a last resort measure in case he loses consciousness and can't be brought around. If that happens, call 911 and get an ambulance there asap. Make sure you tell them he's a diabetic and has passed out from a low. If he had a kit on hand, they can use it if needed, so ask his doctor for a prescription for one and make sure you know how to use it just in case.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	this needs to be addressed by his endocrinologist, or whichever doctor prescribes the insulin.     My theory is that his dose of Lantus is too high. But DO NOT adjust it yourselves without consulting with the doctor first.    He should get to the doctor asap to discuss what is going on, and in the meantime keep a very close eye on blood sugar levels. Make sure he has emergency sugar source around at all times, and that you know how to test his blood sugar and administer glucose or insulin as needed if he is unable to do so.    :)|`|ZNbauLJzaa	As the others said, he needs to consult with his endocrinologist about this.  For now, he needs to keep a meticulous log of what time he eats, what he eats (count carbs as accurately as possible) and how much insulin he is taking.  He may find that his carbs-insulin ratio needs to be adjusted.  Also the carbs-insulin ratio may vary throughout the day.  Only with complete and accurate data can he and the doc work to fix this. Good diabetes management and accurate data go hand in hand.      Good luck!|`|09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by HIS DOCTOR ASAP. There are a few possibilities, and this must be taken seriously. That said, here are some of those possibilities:    1.) If he is newly diagnosed, he may be "honeymooning". This is a temporary condition in which insulin needs decrease for a short period of time while the dying pancreas goes on one last "kick". Insulin needs must be monitored and adjusted with the help of his doctor.    2.) He may have a virus, or some other factor (i.e. stress, weight loss, or increased activity) is throwing off his control. He may need to adjust his basal (background or long acting) insulin.     3.) There is a medical reason. He may have developed another autoimmune disease more common in Type 1 diabetics. These may include Hashimoto's Thyroidits, Celiac Disease, or Addison's Disease (this can be rapidly fatal if untreated). All of these conditions can cause serious issues with control and MUST be ruled out ASAP. Severe unexplained hypoglycemia in a Type 1 diabetic warrants testing for these other conditions. He may also be producing antibodies against the injected insulin. When these antibodies "break away", insulin is released unexpectedly, causing lows. He may also have absorption issues, in which insulin is being released unexpectedly.    Rarer explanations may include a misdiagnosis (perhaps he has MODY or idiopathic Type 1B diabetes, another form of diabetes where insulin needs come and go), or VERY rarely, the possibility of an insulin secreting tumour (yes these exist).     Either way, call his doctor. This would be WAY too complex and serious of a case to try and figure out on your own. He is having serious episodes of hypoglycemia which can be life-threatening.

Chances are you just have to let it pass, but my combo of Sutifed and Amoxicilin (and if you are a girl, take a probiotic to avoid a yeast infection) is working great. I'm still stuffy, but I can now breathe with my mouth closed, so my throat and lips are less dry. Also, the terrible headaches have stopped. That was the worst part.

sMCEx2ztaa	Hello, I won't refer you to a web site, but  will share my story and experience with eczema. I am an adult female in my mid 40's, I was born with eczema unfortunately. Actually, the eldest child  from 5 generations have eczema. I was the lucky one. There was not really a cure fir it at all. Salt water seemed to help out with the itch. As did sunshine. I was lucky enough to live in Florida for a few years of my child hood. Long story short, I have mostly outgrown the eczema with the exception to winter eczema and the kind that relates to my hands being in dish water and the like. I get spotty areas of redness in moist areas. I do have an RX that I do not recommend for a baby because it is steroidal. It works well, it takes the red out. I had to take oil baths, use dove soap to help with the dry itchiness. Seek a good pediatric dermatologist. Hopefully your baby will out grow this as I did. Best of luck.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Go to the dollar store or pharmacy or even Walmart and buy a tube of cortisone cream 1%.

A sign of a child that may have asthma is eczema so keep your eye on that too.|`|J3TpMzHbaa	I have really bad Eczema, I sometimes use creams prescribed from the doctor but recently found a cream called Calendula Cream which you can buy from http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/.

Try to keep your little one moisturized all the time, especially after a bath as water drys the skin out. Keeping hydrated with plenty of water is also very important!

dmX3zwbHaa	Do cardio  4 days aweek (30min running) , 3-4 days weight lifting. After each training you need to eat carbs and protein for good recover and muscle build. Stay of thge candy , this is how your should eat ::  http://www.meadepotato.com/images/triang...    as you can see carbs are the most important and you need to eat them the most.|`|5vT3UDYaaa	Work out everyday, but work different parts of your body. Like have a day set for back then upper body then lower body and have a day just for abs. Eat healthy, stay away from sugary sweets, eat lots of carbs, veggies and add a protein supplement to your diet. I think its better to drink a protein juice in the morning with breakfast and a small one either before or after working out. My fav is vanilla in either a tropical juice or just plain old orange juice, the vanilla just makes it taste like a orange cream pop :). For abs yes do alot of crunches, like 200 in morning and 200 at night everyday. On your ab workout days get a 10lb medicine ball and work with that. Good ones are-balance on your tailbone area with legs up and back off the ground and as fast as you can touch the ball to each side of you-it has to touch the ground. That does amazing work on your side abs. Do a lot of sit ups as well to get the whole six pack , also push ups really help your abs too. I forgot what they're called but where you put yourself in a push up position and just hold it there till you cant anymore? Thats really good for your core muscular strength. Your abs are the one and only muscle that you can work out everyday. Eat close to 3500-4000 calories and start running everyday as well to work off the fat and help build your lower body. Good luck! :)|`|3M3htWrBaa	my advise is get tips from the biggest loser they work on losing weight as well as building up those muscles

The frequent nightly urination stopped for me, but I still went a lot during the day and my seminal fluids were thick, clumpy, and had a yellowish tint to it. If you think it is starting to get better, give it another week or so. If you still have symptoms make an appointment to see a urologist. He can do some tests to see what the problem was. In my case I had signs of prostatitis and my prostate had some inflammation.

d2846213b87d5246da81ceaa4bf3219baa	It may be that your muscles are still sore from being exercised.  If its tremendous soreness then thats not good and you should take a break before working out again, or do less impact excercises. A little bit of pain or tenderness in the areas you worked is a good thing, but you should follow what you think is best for you and what you can handle for now. To help with your calf you could just do simple calf raises, lift your leg up and down to stimulate the muscle or massage your calf area or possibly try a heating pad on it.|`|BeGdFYsFaa	icing is the best thing you can do for recovery.|`|3M3htWrBaa	put ice on it for 30 min then heat for 30 If you have a muscle relaxer that would help you a lot I would wait till it heals and then start again after you recover|`|AA12182074	It definitely sounds like you strained a muscle.

tnEIPjccaa	You will know when they break, as all that rubber will suddenly bunch up. Lol. The best thing you can do to ensure your condoms are in their best shape, is always check the expiration date. Before you use a condom, check for any punctures in the wrapper, by folding the package in half, and squeezing. There should be a small amount of air trapped inside. Don't ever use a condom with an oil based lubricant, or petroleum jelly. And its best to store condoms in a cool place, so keeping it in your wallet in your back pocket is a big no no. Also, double bagging, doesn't make it safer, it actually increases the chance for breakage because of the friction.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	I've only had one break and didn't realize it until we were switching around. Chances are you'll be concentrating on something else while wearing a condom. Whatever you do, don't "double wrap" the friction between the latex layers can cause them to fail, if you're worried, buy some with spermicide and don't finish until you pull out. If you start to put it on backward, get a new one, I've heard freak stories of rogue swimmers finding an egg.

1INN3zyHaa	Buspar is for anxiety, zoloft was made to treat depression. So this all will depend on where your anxiety stems from and which medication  you react better to and that you have less side effects with. I don't believe in medications for everyone though, especially anxiety, has a much higher success rate to treat with talk therapy than with drugs.
09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	Not likely. Your RH Factor test was positive. Do you have Type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes? Since RA is also an autoimmune disease, Type 1 diabetics are at a higher risk to develop RA over the general population. It is not uncommon for autoimmune diseases to cluster in one patient because of the shared genetic tendency. Note that "diabetes" in and of itself does NOT "cause" RA. The reason why *Type 1* diabetics (only) are at a higher risk is due to shared genetic tendency.    Do you have fatigue, joint pain, joint swelling, etc? These are all symptoms of RA. People with (peripheral) neuropathy tend to have shooting pains in their limbs, stabbing sensations, numbness, etc. Although these symptoms can be confused sometimes with Multiple Sclerosis (another autoimmune disease), it would be less likely to confuse DN with RA.    That said, other tests can be done. Some doctors will look at your SED rate, which is a marker of inflammation elevated in RA. However, it can be elevated in any number of health conditions (including other autoimmune diseases), and with a positive RA factor, that pretty much points to RA. Having a normal SED rate (which I think would be unlikely in your case) wouldn't cancel out the other test.    You can also have tests done to help diagnose diabetic neuropathy. Don't forget that you could also have BOTH conditions. One doesn't make you immune from the other.    I think you should work with your doctor from here. Don't forget that you can always get a second opinion. I am sorry to hear that you may have RA, but do know that progress has been made and treatments are better today then ever. The key is to get treatment *early*, before permanent damage has set in. I advise you to speak with your doctor right away about your next step.    Best wishes!|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Diabetes can cause RA, check your blood sugar.|`|4CSXLqMMaa	Neuropathy is related to having nerve damage from being Diabetic.  With Neuropathy there is pain but also numbness and tingling in the legs, feet, hands.  With RA there is stiffness, pain.  I am speaking from personal experience and I hope this helps you.  The medications for RA and for Neuropathy are going to be different.  But to make sure and to ease your mind, call your doctor and ask him/her.  I say this because everyone who suffers from neuropathy and RA are different.  Take care.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|OySU2oAkaa	Hmm. It's definitely hard since you're  vegetarian. I was going to suggest a protein diet but you can't eat meat.    Still, lots of nuts and soybeans have an ample amount so you should definitely include those in your diet. Every morning you should have a fruit for breakfast (one high in fiber) and for lunch you should focus on a good serving of salad and some crackers. Dinner should be small yet tasty ...preferably something with a lot of iron like lentil soup.    Great workouts would be interval training and muscle confusion.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	A womans vagina is supposed to smell like a vagina; musky but clean, the smell changes as hormones change throughout the menstrual cycle but a healthy vagina will never smell bad  if she does not smell bad then there is no reason to do anything, and its just her normal scent. If she smells bad then she may have an infection, it may be an STI but its more likely to be a common infection such as bacterial vaginosis which tends to have a fish-like smell or a fouler odour such as that of ammonia (a result of bacteria)  if she does smell bad then she needs to see a doctor to get tested, its a simple enough test and essential to care for her sexual health. Common infections like thrush, which can cause bad smell without other symptoms, can be cured by any number of home remedies but without knowing exactly what is going on then she shouldnt attempt it. Bacterial infections such as bacterial vaginosis require professional treatment, the only way to deal with such an infection is with antibiotics, without antibiotic cream or tablets from a doctor the infection will not go away and the smell will remain. A gynaecologist should have ran tests on her to find the cause of the infection, it really does sound like bacterial vaginosis which is really no big deal and easy to cure in most women, I would have also thought that she would cure the UTIs  yes constant urination is common if suffering from a UTI but it is a bit of a worry and does require treatment. Have you considered taking your girlfriend to another gynaecologists, perhaps a GUM clinic where they deal with these things more frequently?     Bacterial vaginosis - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_v...    Douching  NEVER douche! To stay clean and healthy all she ever needs to wash with is plain water, her vagina is self-cleaning so it keeps itself clean and only requires her to wash away discharge and dead cells from around the vulva to stay clean. Cleaning products such as soaps, washes, sprays or wipes can all interfere with vaginal pH which can cause harmful bacteria to multiply leading to infections. Also remember not all bacteria is bad, but soaps cannot tell the difference between the positive healthy bacteria and the harmful bacteria so they wash all away. This is also true of so-called 'feminine' products that play on women's insecurities about vaginal scent and attempt to suggest vagina's should smell like flower, just like anything else chemical these products aren't good for vaginal health. Douching is particularly bad as not only are there chemicals that will negatively effect vaginal pH leading to infections, but douching will also force bad bacteria from infections further into the vagina which can lead to more serious problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease. Another thing to point out is that douching washes away vaginal discharge, this discharge is not only there to flush out bacteria and dirt but also protects the walls of the vagina from damage, in flushing discharge away with douching it means a greater risk of vaginal damage and in turn leaves her at greater risk of contracting STIs.     Douching - http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/4903...    There are other common vaginal/vulva health rules to help prevent infections such as keeping dry, wearing plain cotton underwear and avoiding synthetic or tight-fitting clothing can help keep your groin cool and dry. Avoid commercial pads as these can make your groin warm and moist, they also contain chemicals that interfere with vaginal pH, instead try organic or cloth pads, tampons should also be avoided at all costs as they are harmful to vaginal health, instead try softcups or menstrual cups.|`|joiacDUdaa	I would see a different GYNO for starters...

She can also try using panty liners with scents. Or she can try using feminine sprays or powders after baths and showers on her panty liners. She may also need to flush out her system by drinking plenty of water.|`|bZGv0dvnaa	spray some febreeze or rub a can of tuna  ;)|`|4CSXLqMMaa	This sounds like she could either be suffering from Urinary Tract Infection or a Bladder Infection. Either way your girlfriend should go to an Urologist because there is nothing normal about peeing alot unless a person is taking a water pill or diabetic.  Going to an Urologist is the best course to take at this time.  I hope this information helps.  Take care.

See, the only alternatives to this problem, are you can get a hysterectomy, or there are certain types of birth control that decrease the number of periods you have in a year from 12 to about 4.  Birth control does have some problems though, it can cause cervical cancer and HPV (Human Papiloma Virus).  A hysterectomy will make it so that you can no longer have children, but you will never have a period again.  This is a surgery that usually has your fallopian tubes tied, or cut.  Your best bet if you don't want to go through either of these methods is to wear both a super tampon, a pad, leek protective underwear, and change your tampons and pads as much as possible.  Also talk to your doctor, they may come up with something that I haven't.  Good Luck|`|CviEhHUeaa	all i can say is talk to ur doctor about the pill and change ur tampon more often and wear a pantyliner, no bulky diaper feeling.  good luck.   i know ur agony|`|da9b10820ab3418773c06c2801187326aa	How often are you changing the tampons?

tnEIPjccaa	the sad thing is, you can't ever really get rid of it, but there are several options for suppressing the symptoms. The best thing you can do is eat a healthy diet, and maintain a healthy weight. Try your best to avoid things like white bread and if you must eat pasta, switch to whole grain. also, there are several medications your doctor can prescribe to treat the symptoms of PSOC, such as aldactone, metformin, and believe it or not, birth control pills. The hormones in the birth control pills will help prevent the cysts from forming on your ovaries until the time is right that you feel you want a baby. My friend has had great success with this treatment, and just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl last november, and she is 27 now.    Also, when you decide to have children, if you still find it difficult to conceive, you doctor can prescribe a medication called clomid (I think thats the name) that can assist you in ovulating.|`|3ca554b994e514508242f36d37077a74aa	I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2007 when I was 15.  There is no way to get rid of it, but you can treat it. Currently I take glucophage and loestrin 24 fe to help.  I also had surgery for it. My only advice is to talk to your OB GYN and see what can be done for you.  I am not sure how it will affect me once I have children, I have just been told that it might be difficult because I also have endometriosis. TALK TO A DOCTOR.

It has a lot of sugar in it, which eventually turns to fat...I think?!
niZBsn9Qaa	pump your arms when you walk or carry weights, OR strap ankle weights to you under your clothes.    When you go to the supermarket or the mall or anyplace else, park in the farthest parking space away from the entrance and walk there    always use stairs instead of elevator or escalator, everywhere    drink a glass of grapefruit juice with every meal    put lemon in your water    sneak in a jalape?o or chili pepper in your meal someplace. These things help metabolize fat    get plenty of sleep. you burn 60 calories an hour when you sleep.    laugh......seriously, it works muscles and gets the heart rate up    put on some music in your room on youtube or the radio or MP3 and dance, nobody is watching you, so dance, good but VEry good cardio exercise    get up to change the chanel on the tv, dont use the remote    if you can walk someplace instead of drive, do it    you have a dog? play with it, frisbe, running with him, walking him, anything.  :)|`|uXro6Us1aa	There is no trick.. you MUST exercise !!! Walking or treadmill burn alot of calories.. obviously running burns more but it is bad for your knees & ankles !! Eat small portions of meals to shrink your stomach, also you must eat little snacks every two hours to boost your metabolism ! And when I say snacks I mean carrotts, celery, grapes, maybe some wheat toast & peanut butter, in addition to a breakfast, lunch & small dinner. Lay off the red meat if you eat it, only eat small portions. But bottom line you must boost your metabolism by keeping it active not letting it be idle & you must exercise .. BOTH . You cannot take a pill & expect fat to be gone ! .. Do not believe money making commercials or ads.. those are out there to fool you & make money for their company !! When you change your eating habits to healthy foods & more often but small portions & walking everyday for at least 30 mins to an hour or 5 miles a day eventually 4-5 days a week you will see a huge difference in calories burning off  & quicker than ever !|`|3iCRuBTNaa	Getting in shape is NOT easy and there is no magic pill or fad diet that will do the work for you.  Any diet that promises you to lose 10 lbs in 1 week is just depleting you of water weight and actually SLOWING down your metabolism making it that much harder for you to burn calories.  Now if youre a yo-yo dieter multiply that every time you start a new diet and youre slowing down your metabolism EACH time.  No wonder you cant lose weight?!    The secret to being fit is just good old-fashioned diet and exercise.  Its a lifestyle change that only you can make.  You have to have the mind set that your body and health is worth it.  You will feel so much happier, and healthier once you make this change.  Youll be a better wife, mom, sister, husband, friend, etc.      So now that I filled you in on the big secret.  I will share some tips that I have learned in my own fitness quest.  Small, frequent meals are the most effective way to lose weight, and maintain your blood glucose levels.  If youre following a 1200 cal/day diet try to eat 300 for breakfast, 300 for lunch, 300 for dinner, and 2 snacks in between with 150 each.  You will find that you are never hungry, and never full.  Because we all know that Big Mac tastes good going down it doesnt feel so hot sitting in your belly for the next 6 hours.      You have to count your calories- at least in the beginning until you have a good grasp on the nutrition levels and portion amounts that your body needs.  There are lots of websites that can help you log your meals online to see all the nutrition totals.  I like www.myfitnesspal.com  This is a FREE site that allows you to plug in your height/weight/exercise level and will tell you how many calories you need to consume to achieve our goals.  Its personalized, its free, and it works.      Now exercise will be different for everyone and I say do something you enjoythat way you are more likely to stick with it.  A good exercise program will combine cardio and strength training.  Cardio will help you burn calories and torch body fat, while strength training will build muscle, which in turn boosts your metabolism and makes you LEAN.  Girls do not be afraid of weights; they are your best friends.  Im a busy nurse and I work long days so I personally enjoy working out at home to save time and $$.  My favorite DVD programs are Chalean extreme, Turbo Jam, P90X, and Slim in Six.  Check out www.BBfitcoach.com for details.    Make sure you make yourself accountable.  Tell your friends/family about it so they can support you.  Take your body measurements and set reasonable goals to achieve.

I had the same problem, waited too long, finally went to a doctor, turned out to be bronchitis. If bronchitis goes untreated for too long, you're in for a miserable two or three weeks. Are you just coughing or coughing up nasty snot looking stuff (phlem). If you are, do not swallow it. Always try and cough it up.   Drink plenty of room temperature and hot fluids. Teas are really good, especially teas with peppermint, lemon, and honey. Another good way to subside the cough is to mix a few spoonfuls of honey and lemon juice in a glass and heat it in the microwave. The honey coats the throat, the lemon suppresses the cough, the fact that it's hot breaks up mucus in the chest, and it tastes great!|`|0F1775TVaa	It's not in the throat, those sort of coughs come from the chest. You may have some sort of chest cold or even a slight spell of the conjunctivitis that's been going around.    any sort of throat soother may not work much, try medicines that are more about getting rid of a straight sickness or cold, or products such as mucinex to clean out your chest.

I'm assuming it's after a bowel movement..if so, have you checked your stool?  If it looks darker than usual and you're not taking iron supplements, or if you can see blood in your stool, then you probably need to see your doctor.  It could also be from hemorrhoids or anal fissures - which is more common than you might think.  Is having a bowel movement difficult for you?  Does it come out like little marbles or very hard?  If so, it could be caused by not enough water in your diet, lack of fiber or exercise to keep you regular.  If you're not sure, talk with your doctor.  Good Luck.
84f189bdb6a9aebfca4316a93f4b6db0aa	My daughter is at college too and what she considers healthy is a lot different from what I consider to be healthy.  I hope your dr. had some suggestions about your bp... but if not.      From a 58-year old vegetarian female who is way way overweight and just started exercising and eats huge, vast amounts of salt (seriously), my bp today was really low 97/62 pulse range 65.  We all have different "normals"  but I think both you and I are out of the normal range and need to check into what might be causing this.    Re: drinking. If you overcompensated after you drank by taking in a huge amount of water, you might actually have increased your blood volume and pressure.       You should find a reliable pharmacy machine and take your bp at regular times so that you can get a sense of what is normal for you....good luck.|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	It's not so bad, maybe you're stressed.  Eat less animal fat.|`|95oEmw5paa	Very baffling and you need to consult a specialist. Since you are in college, I am not sure what would be covered by your health insurance.       One suggestion though. Some of those healthy foods have very high levels of sodium causing the BP to rise. The prepared shelf foods like canned soups, microwaveable foods, sodas and you will discovered more if you start reading the labels. Add up one day's consumption and see what you come up with. In addition, your body may not be expelling at normal rate, thus raising the BP.        Since you are in college it is impossible to cook meals from scratch. But you could read labels carefully and minimize the sodium intake. Stop reaching out for salt shakers altogether. Instead, squeeze fresh lemon. pepper etc. Slowly you will be able to change your taste and will be able to modify your food preparation methods.       If your High HP is persistent, ask the doctor if you should be taking the medication till everything gets under control.       Good luck.
t27SvIPbaa	You shouldn't be so worried about the cancer as the risk is very low, you should however be worried about the cervical cancer vaccine!<br>  <br>  All cancers result in a vitamin deficiency of B17 and vitamin D which build strong immune system.  Raw vegetables regular exercises are helpful and no processed foods to be taken.<br>  <br>  Watch this video for why you should’t take the vaccines.<br>  <a href="http://www.republicbroadcasting.org/index.php?cmd=videos.video&videoID=147" rel="nofollow">http://www.republicbroadcasting.org/inde...</a><br>  <br>  DON'T TAKE IT!!

The government need sick people because that the biggest money making racket after oil and war. More people make money out of cancer that those who die from it. Do your own research on the Internet, goggle dangerous vaccines or view them on you tube.<br>  <br>  WHY do people not ask what is in the vaccine???????????????

Hope you feel better soon.|`|B56wTXSGaa	grab some shoes, go for a run. it will burn off some of those guilty calories. but dont go and vomit. come on, your better than that.|`|sfnHESg2aa	DON'T vomit, it's going to cause you to have yellow teeth and develop problems.    Drink lots of water, and try to dance to music for 30 minutes, that will burn loads of calories.  You'll be fine.:) everyone eats a lot sometimes|`|NZvYP7Q2aa	If you are a normal weight for your height or are underweight and still feel fat you may want to see a therapist.  If you are actually overweight, binging and purging are bad choices for weight loss b/c they cause health problems that will make you unnattractive - messing up your teeth, skin, hair, etc.|`|DCP2GJDZaa	its called a treat, as long as you don't do it everyday you can do that. enjoy food rather than something you need. also regular exercise will help. don't do any exercise straight after eating though.
O3t4Rccsaa	Sorry but you probably won't hear from a real doctor,, normally they are a little too busy to mess around on Yahoo.  But here are a few sites that can help you.  Good luck  http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/guide/pai...  http://spine-health.com    and here is an interesting article from a sports medicine doctor that may interest you.  http://www.drbookspan.com/BackPainArticl...    Try NOT to do anything that causes your back to hurt,, if your couch is telling you not to do anything then listen,,, not listening could effect the rest of your life    Back/spine injuries are sometimes hard for even the best doctors to figure out,,,  it took a few years, several MRI's, ENG's and every other test they could throw at me to figure out my problem.  There are plenty of things that can cause back pain that are not bones.    Try keeping a little daily journal on how you feel and what is making you hurt and take it to the doctor when you see him,,, it may help him better understand what the problem is.    Ignore the stupid answer from Anon,,, unfortunately there are a bunch of people that have nothing better to do.  His answer has been reported|`|2W5xfxCHaa	you're screwed|`|1HLPznZhaa	I would suggest you see a Dr. trained and specializing in sports medicine..something is definitely wrong somewhere..You are too young to be going thru this ..Good luck|`|VCIZJQCJaa	not sure,you didn't mention the exact spot. possibly an old injury coming back to haunt you,with a growth spurt.did they check to see if your pelvis is  fractured or aligned.a common ailment affecting 50% of gymnasts is spondylolysic stress.at 4-5 lumbar.it is known as an over use injury. did you hyper extend?.then the stork test is needed..sports medicine doctor is very knowledgeable,i hope you get relief,and soon

1HLPznZhaa	Have you called the surgeon that removed your appendix ? He is qualified to answer your question .. we are not ..

CJbZw69haa	On Wave 3 news they said it you need to boil the water before drinking it until further notice. If you still aren't sure you can try calling the water company in your area or you local police department and/or fire department and they will let you know.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	Might want to write Brita.  But the filter is said to filter out 99.9% of impurities.|`|I3wY7wD9aa	Call your county office and ask about the water advisory. If they are saying to boil the water - then boil the water. Never rely on a filter to get rid of all  toxins. More than likely there have been frozen pipes and when thawed they always create a lot of debris that flows through the pipes.
LBD3CLqGaa	I actually heard that digesting Large quantities of food, hot liquid or dairy products in your sleep makes you either sweat or sleep "heavy" (waking up, remembering no dream, feeling like you weigh a ton).     The drinking milk habit comes from a time where kids didn't like milk/ did not have a lot available. It was, then, rather taken the way you take a vitamin tablet or a night drug, as a remedy against "lack of vitamin/calories" (which is no longer up to date in our western societies).|`|revtaNjsaa	I recommend brushing your teeth after.

Rk46lIBwaa	STIs can occasionally be contracted in other ways.  The main risk is from needle sharing or contact with contaminated blood products. these all require exchange of body fluids in some way. The only other problem is pubic lice, which could be contracted by sharing a bed, without requiring sexual contact.|`|q3cPtYZ9aa	Very unlikely. Depends which STD it is.

Research has shown that when you urinate about 70% of the urination is vitamins. the other 30% is water. When you urinate you lose a mass percentage of vitamins, and if you were to consume that urine you would regain all those vitamins. Drinking your own urine is in no way, shape, or form bad for you.

ff5e99089b4a2209f431aa007aa43450aa	I recently had my labrum repaired (torn 3/4 of the way off) the risks that they told me about pre op were that there was a small chance of the anchors coming out (they drill a hole into the bone, insert ends of anchor) or there could be a problem with any part of the reattachment of the rotator cuff that could easily cause something like that. 
q4rdye4vaa	I had that happen years ago.  What I did is gonna sound wild, but it worked, I used a couple drops of "sweet oil" which my mom used to put in my ear with an eyedropper as a kid. I figured it'd suffocate the bugger.  Then stuck some cotton in there and laid w/ that side down.  <br>  Later on, I flushed it with peroxide, which is what I do a couple times a year anyway. It sounds like a popcorn popper in there. But bug pieces started bubbling out. Use however many times.  You'll still have the watery ear, but just keep laying in that side w/ cotton in, then nothing in, it'll dry out, absorb.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Let us know , ok?|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	You need to get your ear looked at.  My guess is that the bug is still in there.  Call up an audiologist and ask for a price for this.  They should be able to remove whatever you have in there.  It should be quite a bit cheaper than going to a doctor, but the audiologist is trained and licensed to do exactly this.|`|ff5e99089b4a2209f431aa007aa43450aa	it sounds like the bug is still in your ear. Go see a doctor, most doctors should be able to get it out, if not they can refer you to someone who can.

Also use an anti-septic mouth wash, not just a breath freshener.|`|nzoGkGBHaa	some people have a disease in there mouth that causes bad breath and it can be fixed, but very expensive... i saw it on "The Flavor of Love" and she wore a lifesaver necklace around haha (im totally not suggesting you wear  one lol) but maybe just chew gum when you can, unless its worth the money to you.. than look into it :)|`|0LOgZc6Yaa	Hi remeber that apart brushing properly your teeth you also need to use the floss at least once a week. That's because with the floss you can reach some deep and hide dental areas you couldn't get with the teethbrush!<br>  Of course also toothpastes and mouthwashes are important but not as much as good brushing and flossing.<br>  And don't forget to  brush also your tongue!|`|9ae919aecab255ec4dd5fb19b5c555e8aa	use peoxride after you brush works for me|`|HZHvtI8faa	ewwwh...i can smell it from here.
O23x96t5aa	You mean after how many days after contact with another person do you come to know whether you have gonorrhea. Right?  Usual time period between exposure to the disease and symptoms is about 2 - 8 days.  But mostly it appears after 1 to 3 days.  In men discharge, dysurea etc starts within 1 to 3 days but may delay up to 1 week.  In women it is different.  They may have mild symptoms of discharge, dysurea etc but sometimes there will be no symptoms in women.  But a gram stain or culture from the area or pus will show the organism.
