20090202215010AARxK2i	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Okay to show a 6 year old?	I want to show my little sister the movie Spirited Away. I loved that movie when I was little, however there is a slight problem. I am a christian, and my entire family is, and the movie is based of the Chinese/Japanese religion filled with demons and gods and spirits. Not the scary freaky kind, the really colorful and just plain odd looking type.      Now I'm thinking that to a six year old, these things will just come off as some magical creatures like you would find in a fairy tale book instead of making her question and contradict the existence of god.      Opinions?

20090202221134AA0fMFR	Entertainment & Music;Movies	HELP!?! Need help to name movie from my childhood(Late 80's early 90's)?	I used to watch this at my babysitters. I wish I could remember more but here's what I got so far.   I'm almost positive it is a movie by f.h.e (Family Home Entertainment) b/c I think I remember the lowercase kid writing logo.  The movie was a sing-a-long or they always were singing songs. Each scene that started a new song was a different color theme. I really remember the red scene, Where it was a family sitting the front porch of their house and they all had red outfits on ...it was like they were little house on the prairie or hillbillies, and I remember the mom rocking the baby and then I think the family started singing something. But there was all different color themes depending on the scene in the movie. It must be older I'm think made in late 80's or early 90's since I was born in 88. Any feedback that can help me figure this movie out would be awesome...it's stumped me for years! Hope my description is a little helpful...I'll keep trying to think of more...Questions please ask! Thanks!

A young Technician and his General Manager board a train headed through the mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place to sit except for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother.      After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young tech are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks.      Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap. When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word.      The grandmother is thinking to herself, "It was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I'm glad she slapped him."      The General manager is setting there thinking, "I didn't know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn't missed him when she slapped and hit me!"      The young woman was sitting and thinking, "I'm glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!"      The young tech sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, "Life is good. How often does a guy have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his General manager all at the same time!"

Is "Step Sister", a two part OVA that delves into bondage and other acts without being too overbearing. The art and animation weren't too bad either.      So, based on that one hentai. Can anyone recommend  a similar hentai with a similar (or close to it) plot and/or bondage tendencies?               Much obliged.

They were fixing to sit down when Chuck took a restroom break.  "you guys go ahead sit down and talk, i'll be right back."  Bill, Bob, and Ray started talking about how proud they were about the success of their sons.  Bill starts by saying 'i'm so proud of my son!  He is a very successful realtor and an entrepreneur.  He's so rich he bought his friend a $3 million home for his birthday!'  'wow that's great Bill' Bob says.  'my son is my pride and joy and he has made me so proud.  he is a very successful engineer. He owns an airline company and is so rich he bought his friend a jet for his birthday!' 'that's wonderful, bill' Ray implies. 'my son made me proud also.  he is a very successful businessman and is so rich he bought his friend a boat for his birthday!'  'that's awsome guys' says Bill.  Just as they are congradulating each other Chuck comes out of the bathroom and says 'what all the congradulations for?' Ray says, 'we were just talking about how proud we were of our sons!'  'What about your son, chuck?'  'well, my son is gay and is a drag queen at the night club'. chuck says dissapointedly.  'ooo, sorry to hear about that chuck.' bill says.  then chuck replies, 'well that's okay he's doing pretty good though kinda proud of him.'  'Really?' bob says.  Chuck then replies, 'oh yeah, he just recieved a 3 million dollar mansion, a jet and a boat for his birthday from 3 of his closest friends!

Not the Cheese State. Not the Garden State.....GOLDEN!!!       - We have In-N-Out (Arizona and Vegas are lucky we share that with them)       - I have the most representation in the House of Representatives, which means MY opinion means more than yours, which means I'm better than you       - The best athletes come from here       ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...       WHY TEXAS IS BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA:       Hey... California listen up... Texas is where its at!       - I too can wear sandals all year long... plus I can put on boots to stomp your toes and I won't even stick out.       - You may be able to go to the "beach" instead of the "shore"... but can you go to the drive thru "Beer Barn?" What now surfer boy?       - You're chicks aren't way hotter than ours... they are almost equal... and thats only due to silicone, saline, botox, lasers and hair dye... We have the real ones and they can beat yours up.       - We're taught to say "Yes Sir" and "Yes Ma'am" and respect our elders because of it. We also say "Howdy" and "fixin" and "Yall" are pretty much recognized right away anywhere in the world :) We're famous       - You may know what real cheese and avocados taste like... but I know what 100% Grade A Angus Beef tastes like. Who wants avocados and cheese when you can have steak and potatoes?       - Haha... who do you think grows the weed and sells it to you?       - Why roll 40 deep when something goes down if 5 corn fed country boys can get the job done...       - I live next door to Americans, but we call them Mexicans       - About your Porn.... 3 words...

Thats nice, I haven't even come home by then.       - Ok... you said,"You judge people based on what area code they live in, and when asked where you're from, you give your area code" and as hard as I try I have no idea what you're talking about... I think you're watching too much TV.       - Yeah, you'll definitely get looked at funny when you come to visit but we have another name for you pretty boys, and its not Greek, its French.       - Of course you don't stop at stop signs... none of you can drive.       - You can pick up Real Mexican food 24 hours a day huh... well I can swing by home depot and pick up 24 Real Mexicans anytime of day.

We're the Lone Star State...the one and only!!       - Do I have to remind you about the drive thru Beer Barn again? Does In-N-Out serve alcohol? (Oh and did I mention Dr. Pepper was created in Texas?)[TEXAS does have an In-N-Out as well. Liberty, Texas, baby...so stick that in your juice box and suck it!]       - You guys have the best athletes huh?... Eight words... Lance Armstrong and The University of Texas at Austin       Though I could mention MICHAEL JOHNSON - Olympic Sprinter, World record holder in 200m and 400m, 5 Olympic Gold medals, 9 time World Champion (born Dallas, TX)       Oh and remind me again who won the Rose Bowl between USC and Texas????? I believe it was the LONGHORNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       - Football is a religion, not a sport       - In Texas, football means football, not soccer.       - 90% of football "movies" you guys are making are about Texas Football.       -Varsity Blues, filmed in Georgetown, TX - Friday Night Lights, filmed in Odessa, TX - Necessary Roughness, filmed in San Marcos, TX       - Texas is the only state that can still separate to become its own country. The only way California's gonna accomplish that is if another earthquake comes along and you guys sink into the ocean. Can you say Atlantis.... hahaha       -Everything is BIGGER in TEXAS       Come on Texans Show Your Colors! Repost!       And as the Great Sam Houston once said "Texas could survive without the United States, but the United States could not survive without Texas"

He whispered, "I'm lonely too, buy me and you won't be sorry."      The old Lady figured, what the heck, as she hadn't found anything else. So, she bought the frog and went to her car. Driving down the road the frog whispered to her, "Kiss me, you won't be sorry." So, the old lady figured what the heck, and kissed the frog.

After finally watching an episode of Bromance I've come to the conclusion, that would of the ones I have watched, my least 2 favorite are:      Bromance--It's making me really believe that Brody Jenner is gay. By the way, who IS brody jenner anyway?      Double Shot at Love with the IKKI twins- Incest much? It's sort of the same concept as Real Chance of Love. However, in the beginning RCOL divided the group into "real's girls" and "chances girls" This show doesn't even make sense. These twins are making out with the same people and just hoping that they won't fall in love with the same person....ew.

20090202235250AAECtZF	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Question about the new show True Beauty?	So if you have seen the show you know that its a reality show where the people on there think they're on a typical beauty show but they are really being judged on their inner beauty and at the end of each episode they reveal that they have been really looking for a beautiful person on the inside.    My question is if they are planning on have a second season for this show how do you think they will get people to participate because after watching the show and seeing that they really want nice people anyone can "act" like they are nice just to be on t.v and win some money.    What kind of catchy things do you think the casting people will do to try and fool people into thinking its a real reality show when we really know that its not?

My all time favorite song not many people have ever heard.    Sing a song of six pence a pocket full of rye, Four and twenty black bids baked in a pie. When the pie was open the birds began to sing wasn't that a dainty dish to set befor the king.   The king was in the counting house counting out his pennies.The queen was in the parlor eating bread and honey. The maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes and along came the black bird and snapped off her nose.   My mom sang that to me every night at bed time. Now I sing it to my boys. My little one can't fall asleep without it.

20090203023459AAtKhvb	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Movies that are worth viewing again (and again)?	Can you guys recommend some? Any genre will do.. But of course usually action and horror movies, though very entertaining the first time you see it, wouldn't be worth seeing it again (the surprise is isn't there anymore, which is the major entertainment in these genres), but there may be some exceptions..    In watching movies (and more so in reading books), it is often the case that your situation, environment, emotions, experiences, etc. during the course of watching that affects how you develop and create your views and perspectives regarding the movie. Thus, watching the movie again in another time, even though you know what's going to happen next or even the next dialogue, you will always gain a new perspective or insight from the movie..

Now his mind travels back to the only time he has ever been unfaithful to his wife and says,   "My God, are you the stripper from my bachelor party that I laid on the pool table with all my buddies watching, while your partner whipped my butt with wet celery and then stuck a carrot up my butt???

20090203005854AA2weKl	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Is this joke annoying..Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean ,?	two prawns were swimming around in the sea      One called Justin and the other called Christian.      The prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that inhabited the area.      Finally one day Justin said to Christian, 'I'm fed up with being a prawn;   I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten.'      A large mysterious cod appeared and said, 'Your wish is granted'      Lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.      Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.      Time passed (as it does) and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely.      All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them.      Justin didn't realize that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.      While swimming alone one day he saw the mysterious cod again and he thought perhaps the mysterious fish could change him back into a prawn.      He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold,   he found himself turned back into a prawn.      With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail.      Looking around the gathering at the reef he realized he couldn't see his old pal.      'Where's Christian?' he asked.      'He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy & became a shark', came the reply.      Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode.      As he opened the coral gate, memories came flooding back.      He banged on the door and shouted, 'It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.'      Christian replied, 'No way man, you'll eat me. You're now a shark, the enemy,   and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.'      Justin cried back 'No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed.'.........         .            .            .            .            .            .      .            .            .            .            .            I've found Cod.

20090203021832AAwO7zk	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Joke ...................funny or not?	One day an out of work mime is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a street performer. As soon as he starts   to draw a crowd, a zoo keeper grabs him and drags him into his office. The zoo keeper explains to the mime that the zoo's most   popular attraction, a gorilla, has died suddenly and the keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off. He offers the mime    a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mime accepts.   So the next morning the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before the crowd comes. He discovers that it's a great   job. He can sleep all he wants, play  and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime. However,    eventually the crowds tire of him and he tires of just swinging on tires. He begins to notice that the people are paying more    attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to the top of his cage,    crawls across a partition, and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves   it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. Well, this goes on    for some time, the mime keeps taunting the lion, the crowds grow larger, and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day    when he is dangling over the furious lion he slips and falls. The mime is terrified.   The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the    lion close behind. Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, "Help, Help me!", but the lion is quick and pounces. The    mime soon finds  himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says, "Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get    us both fired?"

OF MY LIFE.   im pretty sure he likes me back- but i havnt told him yet.   i love him so much.   hes funny, handsome, intelligent, witty, good listener, hard worker- everything i want basically.   but i showed my mother a picture of him on my facebook and she said.   "oh"   because hes black.   and im upset because she then went on to say that she doesnt want me to start seeing him and stuff or she will tell my dad who is really strict.   i dont know what to do.   shes only looking skin deep and wont even give him a chance and i want them to get along so bad.   if he was white them in sure she'd love him because hes just perfect in my eyes.   i never see his skin colour- just him.   and it hurts me that my mum thinks like this.   what do i do??????

20090203011239AA2grXY	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does anyone know a really good horror movie [a scare me out of my mind, can't sleep for a week horror movie]?	I've been wanting to watch a good horror for the past few days. My husband and I have an extensive dvd collection, and recently bought some new DVDs and received some in the mail as well [we are both signed up for the Columbia House DVD club and blockbuster recently had a sale that was buy 2 get 3 free on the previously viewed DVDs - so our collection grew]. Anyway, we have a lot of horror DVDs within this collection, and have been watching a lot the last couple of days, and nothing is scary. I'm not sure if I'm desensitized to the horror movies, or if everything just sucks. lol.       We watched: The Resident Evil Trilogy, 28 Days and 28 Weeks Later, The Eye, Pulse, Saw 5, Joy Ride, Black Christmas and Texas Chainsaw. Nothing is working. There's no story line. It's all a lot of blood, but no story, no fear. I want to be scared. I want to be jumping out of my seat, having my husband check under the bed and in the closet and sleeping with the lights on for three days after the movie. =D       Any suggestions? Doesn't matter if it's subtitles or black and white, anything. THANK YOU.

After they go to the room, the clerk realized that he charged too much. The room was supposed to be only $25. So he gave $5 to the bell boy and told him to refund it to the salesmen. The bell boy gave each man $1 back and kept the remaining $2 for a tip. That means each man paid $9.    9 x 3 = 27 plus the 2 the bellboy kept adds to only 29. Where did the last dollar go to make $30?

So it has been a long time since I've seen this movie and I can't remember the name. Basically what occurs is multiple gladiator fights. A human fights all these weird monsters in an arena with his first enemy being this giant pink flesh looking worm and the final enemy kind of looks like a minotaur. Apparently the  "hero" character is the last human to compete in these intergalactic gladiator fights and tries to regain the title of champion for the human species. I know this is kind of vague and I'm sure this movie is most likely pretty crappy, but I would like to watch it again. Thanks in advance!

I was really disappointed, the box i think was misleading, it says they are going to have to go way beyond what they thought themselves cape able of surviving. In my opinion i thought that would mean like what they did on saw, Not them trying to hide the whole film. I was very disappointed and would never watch it again. I know it was based on a true events and no one knows what happened if that's why, but still what a waste of money!! What did you think?

20090203020222AALqfRr	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A good joke you haven't read before?	.. continued on from a story      When our lawn-mower broke, my wife was always trying to make me realize that i should fix it, but i always had something more important to do: the trunk, the fishing, the car; always something was more important.      Finally she thought of a smart way to convince me.One day when i got home I found her sitting on the high grass, cutting it with little nail scissors. I looked at her with silence for a while, got really touched and went inside the house.      Few minutes later i went back to her and gave her the toothbrush. "When you finish to cutting the grass", I said, "you can broom the sidewalk as well."      After that I don't remember a thing. The doctors said that I'll walk again, but I'll limp forever. Marriage is a relationship between two people, in which one is always right and the other one is the husband.

20090203010849AAfAckC	Entertainment & Music;Music;Jazz	Does training embouchure muscles for trumpet have any analogy in training other muscles of the body?	I used to play trumpet in middle school. Now I'm in college and am trying to learn trumpet again for fun. I'm a jazz guitarist with a decent ear and I still remember technique for trumpet so my fingers aren't the issue here (I played Euphonium in high school which is same fingerings).      The issue is getting my facial muscles back in shape. Its frustrating to have ideas to play for improvisation but not the ability. What is the fastest way to develop these muscles? If I play until I'm worn out one day, could taking a day off inbetween practices be beneficial, as it is with weightlifting regimens (or most other exercise regimens for that matter). Do the embouchure muscles need time to regenerate at this early stage in their development? Of course I know that professionals need to do maintenance practice every day just to keep their range and stuff in shape, but towards the beginning, when I can only last 20 minutes at a time (even with allowing as much time off the horn as on when practicing long tones and such), do you think taking breaks like that could help, or should I just keep chugging away frustrated everyday, barely able to play an E? How long should it take to be able to play a G (assuming I never use excessive pressure)? To hit a C?

20090203013104AA6lcd2	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Am I being selfish about this? Please Read!!!?	We just moved house over the Christmas break, and I started my first day of my new school. I didn't want to move house and the school - I don't like it. Plain and simple.      I'm in my second to last year, so where I come from, it's a make it or break it year. Now, I don't like the teachers at my new school. They stink to be quite honest.      I like my old school better. The teachers know me and what I am capable of achieving and they know my strengths and weaknesses and how to work around and with them to benefit me.      So, I was wanting to go back to my old school, but my dad is very reluctant to let me go back - as it's about an hour's drive away. But my education is important to me and I want the best for myself. I think I would be better off at my old school.      Am I being selfish for not accepting this new school, or am I doing the right thing by going back to where I am most comfortable in this make it or break it year?

20090203014931AA86Du7	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Female trouble.......................	Dear Technical Support,    18 months ago, I upgraded to Girlfriend 1.0 from DrinkingMates 4.2, which I had used for years without any trouble.    However, there are apparently conflicts between these two products and the only solution was to try and run Girlfriend 1.0 with the sound turned off. To make matters worse, Girlfriend 1.0 is incompatible with several other applications, such as LadsNightOut 3.1, Football 4.5, and Playboy 6.9.    Successive versions of Girlfriend proved no better.    I tried a shareware program, Slapper 2.1, but it had many bugs and left a virus in my system, forcing me to shut down completely for several weeks.    Eventually, I tried to run Girlfriend 1.2 and Girlfriend 1.0 at the same time, only to discover that when these two systems detected each other they caused severe damage to my hardware.    I eventually upgraded to Fiance 1.0, only to discover that this product soon had to be upgraded further to Wife 1.0. While Wife 1.0 tends to use up all my available resources, it does come bundled with CookingPlus and Cleanhouse2008.    Shortly after this upgrade, however, I found that Wife 1.0 could be very unstable and costly to run. Any mistakes I made were automatically stored in Wife 1.0's memory and could not be deleted. They then resurfaced months later when I had forgotten about them.    Wife 1.0 also has an automatic Diary, Explorer and E-mail filter, and can, without warning, launch TurboStrop and Multi-Whinge.    These latter products have no Help files, and I have to try to guess what the problem is.    Additional problems are that Wife 1.0 needs updating regularly, requiring ShoeShop Browser for new attachments and Hairstyle Express which needs to be reinstalled every oth er week.    Also, when Wife 1.0 attaches itself to my Saab 93 Convertible hard drive, it often crashes.    Wife 1.0 also comes with an irritating pop-up called MotherInLaw, which can't be turned off.    Recently I've been tempted to install Mistress 2007, but there could be problems. A friend of mine has alerted me to the fact that if Wife 1.0 detects Mistress 2007, it tends to delete all of your Money before uninstalling itself.    Help requested please!

I was recently reminded of the animated series of Cybersix (ah, childhood memories), and did a little reading on Wiki about it, and found out it's based off a comic.      I'd love to find them, in fact I found volume 1, ch1-7, but I was wondering if there are any more chapters to that volume, and if there are additional volumes.      You don't have to put up any links to where I can find them (but if you do, I'll love you forever!), but the main question is to how many volumes (and how many chapters are in those volumes).      Thanks!  ^__^

I hope thats enough to figure it out... So onto my next song. I hear this song a lot but I can never figure out who sings it.       And I don't want the world to see me,   But I don't think that they'd understand,   And if everythings ment to be broken,   I just want you to know who I am.      Thanks!!!      ~ Sami

20060721220809AAZAlhX	Entertainment & Music;Music	Is 2pac reincarnated/alive?	Although September 2003 (1996 + 7 = 2003) has passed, i believe that the most convincing theory circulating on the Internet is 2006       1996 + (7) DAY THEORY = 2003 (Resurrection)    2003 + (3) DAY THEORY = 2006 (Reincarnation) & (Resurrection)      Hence, a collaboration of seven day theory and three day theory       "3 Day Theory - Killuminati to your body" - Krazy       "Death Row Records is about to be turned over to the U.S. Government. Suge Knight once again failed to make his court appearance to discuss financial and legal obligations. Courts will take control of “Death Row Records” and either dissolve or sell off the company and it’s assets.    There is now a 90% chance that Death Row Records will be handed over to the receiver, who will be in control of music from Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, and Snoop just to name the big names."          A $72 million life insurance has yet to be cashed. This means that no legal actions can be taken against him as long as it is not cashed.       Therefore, do you believe Death Row Records will be handed to Tupac Shakur in 2006?       Live 2 Tell, movie written by Tupac Shakur before his death and produced by Insomnia Media will be released in 2006.       Will Tupac Shakur feature in Live 2 Tell in 2006 ?          and theres a new artist out dont kno the name like 3be but heres a site  http://www.towerrecords.com/product....H...  lsiten 2 the sample clip he says sumthin about napo      (7) DAY THEORY + 1996 = 2003   (3) DAY THEORY + 2003 = 2006      "EXIT TUPAC ENTER MAKAVELI". - Inside Makaveli album cover      This implies that Tupac is reincarnated/resurrected as Makaveli.       Makaveli is Makaveli Literally    (7) DAY THEORY + (3) DAY THEORY Resurrection = 2006 !!!    7 years + 3 years = 2006    DISC1    10. Born a Ridah <--PROOF    (Makaveli) the real Nicolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) was Italian/Latino or of some latin origin.    this was to ensure you knew it was him      I really believe he is reincarnated not as 2pac but as (Makaveli) the real Nicolo Machiavelli (1469-1527)

"This day is the worst of my life," the man says, mopping at his tears with his sleeve. "First, I got fired for oversleeping and getting to work late. Then, as I'm leaving the building, I find out my car was stolen. I get in a cab to return home and I forget my wallet and credit cards in the cab. Then, I go inside and find my wife in bed with my best friend. So I end up at this bar, and just when I was thinking about putting an end to my life, you show up and drink my poison!"

Does anybody else find that kind of wrong? I do. I don't want my generation defined by such a sh*tty event. And the actions taken by the president thereafter.      I'm pretty sure some of you will say the defining moment is not the planes crashing, or the towers falling, its the effort put forth by people to help each other in a crisis. Even so, the effort to help one another is long gone with most people. Now the only that has lasted is the war that began.      I'd rather have my generation defined by something awesome. The cure for cancer or something. Hell, a car that runs on water. Anything that would actually be a benefit to the human race.      But not two planes crashinig into a building...no thanks.

A couple of years ago a friend told me he had heard they were gonna end PA movies with a reunion and finale,       The two names given at the time were:      Their Final Assignment   Mission to Baghdad      Michael Winslow and Bubba Smith have both confirmed that it is in the works and it has a yahoo movie page but no release date.      However in the last year a discussion board has pointed out web pages that show not just a reunion but a new generation of movies and stars.      My first oppinion is that its too late to touch these in a new way. In 1994 HBO made "Mission to Moscow" didnt even come to theatres.

I've asked this before and the most responses I've got led me to Disney's The Other Me, but that's not what it was though it had the same description. The movie I'm looking for was made in the 90's and it dealt with a boy who had made a clone of himself, not from a chemical mixture, but the clone actually hatched from a huge egg in the boys bedroom. The clone ends up going to school for this kid and people start to like him more. There is also a girl that likes him who is gorgeous (from what I remember when I was younger). Any other ideas for this movie other then, The Other Me, which I know it is not because that was made in 2000.
