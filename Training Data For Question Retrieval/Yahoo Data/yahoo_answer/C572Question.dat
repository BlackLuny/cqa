20090225101338AAlFyPA	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Should I get my arm looked at again? or is this nothing?	I broke my arm early January and I got my cast off a few weeks ago. When they took my cast off they said my arm was still broken but there was calus holding my bones together so I would be fine without a cast. There was also a bump on my arm and they said that was normal and it was just tissue going to the area and it shouldn't be a problem. However, since I've gotten my cast off the bump has gotten much much bigger and the bigger it gets the more it hurts. I don't really know if this is serious or anything, should I ask my doctor about this?

I am on ortho tricyclen low and it seems like ever since I have been on it I have had really intense cravings and it is hard for me to control my appetite. Before going on the pill, I had pretty good will power and was good about eating healthy meals and staying satisfied. Since I have been on the pill I crave chocolate like 24/7 and other sweets. This is horrible!! Anyone else have this problem. I am thinking I need to change birth control because I feel like I don't even have control over my own appetite any more. I have never had this problem......advice and any information or self experience would be great...thanks!

20090227125304AAuuamf	Health;Women's Health	Breast enlargement- products and supplements?	In short: I'd like bigger breasts. I'm currently using hypnosis and that seems to be working, but REALLY REALLY SLOWLY! It's taken me two months to grow about an inch.       I'd like to know if there are any safe, effective, and most preferably affordable breast enhancement products, available to buy in stores. Failing that, are there any supplements I can take, which are available from health food stores or something? I've heard about fennel and something called fenugreek but I'm not entirely sure.    If you have any recommendations, for anything that increases breast size (aside from exercise, I've tried and failed miserably), please comment.   Thanks :)

20090227134634AAxBfLF	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I lose 5-10 more pounds? 10 points?(anyone who's had an eating disorder, please help too?)?	okay, so first off, keep in mind that I am recovering from an eating disorder, so don't give me anything too drastic to try, because I really don't want to relapse. anyways,       Since this past november, I was doing vigorous cardio for at least an hour a day and eating about 850-1200 calories. I lost one pound a week.       then, at the end of december, I went on a cruise. I maintained my weight, but after the cruise, I could not lose weight for some reason. I kept dieting and exercising for another month and a half, but I never lost any more weight.      so I started eating less, and working out harder. I lost 2 pounds.      for the past couple of weeks, I was absolutely exhausted from exercising 5 days a week for so hard, and trying not to eat very much, and of course I've had an eating disorder so I was trying not to go too overboard, and I was discouraged the whole time, anyways I was just at my limit. so I've been maintaining my weight for the past few weeks, I've been eating pretty normally, and exercising lightly.      but I want to lose 5-10 more pounds.      how can I do that safely?      I am 16, 4'11, and 100 pounds.   don't tell me I don't need to lose weight, you won't be helping anyone.

Here are pictures of a girl:       http://img205.imageshack.us/my.php?image...     http://img15.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...     http://img15.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...     http://img205.imageshack.us/my.php?image...     http://img205.imageshack.us/my.php?image...       She is about 163-165 cm-s tall. She doesn't have a model body but she has the dream body for me. Because she looks so feminine without being too skinny. She is just right. She has a thin waist.(I think a thin waist makes everyone look feminine, no matter how big they are elsewhere).      OK now here come my pics, I'm about 171 cm-s tall:       http://img150.imageshack.us/my.php?image...     http://img18.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...     http://img6.imageshack.us/my.php?image=3...     http://img88.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...       I chose some bad pictures about myself, I can look thinner if I want with dressing up but you know, I want to look good in a bikini, because I know how I look like and that is what makes me feel bad about myself.      So do you guys honestly think I can achieve the body that she has? Or do we have a different bodyshape? Does she have a smaller frame that I will never be able to have? Or because I don't have a thin waistline, I cannot look like her?   The most problem I have with my thighs, because no matter how much I work out,I can only flatten my abs and lose some weight but not see much difference on my thighs...      OK so that's all...hope to read your comments on what you think. Thank you in advance!

I am currently trying to recover from anorexia/bulimia. I am eating about 2300 calories per day and about 25 grams of fat, I kinda have a thing about the fats(almost all are healthy fats, usually no more than 4 grams saturated).    I am a vegetarian, also.    Everyone at my school tells me that I don't eat enough, even though I do and they don't realize how much I eat and how full and bloated and miserable I am. They also say that eating too healthy can counter act and be unhappy and make me die, which is a bunch of bull crap! It just really hurts my feeling, even my best friends say it.   My diet consists of:   Kashi products(oatmeal, cereal, waffles, rice, pizza, etc...I practically live off it)   8th continent soymilk...i usually dont use regualar milk   brown rice   whole grain pasta   whole grain bread   broccoli   mixed vegetables   bananas   apples   dried apricots   raisins   oranges   orange juice   apple juice   rye bread   fat free pudding   Odwalla Bars   Ensure Shakes..occasionally the plus   pistachio nuts   Spirutein protein shakes w/ 1 cup soymilk and 1 tbsp natural peanut butter   organic soups(Amys or Muir glen)      Breakfast:   waffles   syrup   fat free cream cheese   ensure shake   juice      Lunch:   Odwalla bar   brown rice   veggies   broccoli   dried apricots   raisins   pretzels      Snack:   orange, apple, or banana   Spirutein protein shake(soymilk and peanut butter, sometimes banana)      Dinner:   pasta   tomato sauce   juice   english muffin with apple butter      Snack:   ensure   popcorn   fruit      That is pretty much what my diet consists of, is it healthy??

20090227155603AApZxAs	Health;Other - Health	Constant ticklish throat?	What could this be? It started out over 2 months ago as a feeling of mild tonsillitis. When it became an acute ulcer like pain that made eating difficult I went to see a doctor.      She sent me to an ENT doctor (ear, nose, throat) who put a device down my nose into my throat. By the time I saw him the pain had mainly gone and it was just a ticklish feeling now and then.      He said there was no evidence of throat cancer and said it might be excess stomach acid rising and tickling my throat. He gave me some pills to help this. He noticed my throat was slightly red which he attributed to smoking but I have hardly smoked at all in the last 4 years.      That was 4 weeks ago.      Since then my throat has gotten progressively more and more ticklish. Now its a constant ticklish feeling and I am often coughing. There is no flem when I cough. I've only remembered to take about 10 pills but they've made no difference I don't think since it's just gotten worse.      Anyone know what this could be? Should I go back and see him?      Thanks

I normally have a very consistent periods (every 28days), but last month it was a little off.  It came the day it was due but only lasted 2 days and was only heavy for 1 day (usually lasts 6-7 and very heavy for about 3 days)  and I didn't have any of the usual cramps/backaches.  I thought maybe I was pregnant but took several hpts and all were negative.        Next period shouldn't start until this coming Sunday but yesterday I started bleeding lightly on and off throughout the day then in the evening it stopped altogether.  When I woke up this morning I was bleeding again but this time very heavy.  Almost immediately I had severe cramps, back pain and nausea.  This has lasted all day and I have taken Tylenol, Aleve and Advil (not all at once:).  Nothing is helping and the pain is so bad it hurts to stand sometimes.  A couple of times it almost reminded me of labor pains...MISERABLE.  This might be TMI but on my tampons (not every time) there's been a small amount of whitish mucos-looking stuff mixed in with the blood.  I normally have some clots but it's all blood and this time it a mixture.  I want to throw up now:(        If there's anyone still reading this disgusting description and has any idea of what's going on with me and anyway that I can relive the pain, please let me know!!!!      ***If it makes any difference, I have a 2 kids (4yrs & 10mos) and ttc #3!

Last month I was sick the whole month after I stupidly ran outside in really cold weather below freezing with a small cold.  My parents think I got bronchial pneumonia or something close to it but I never went to the doctor. All I know is during that week I could barely walk for 10 minutes with out being so winded and barely being able to breath.  It got so bad one weekend that I couldn't even move without feeling sick I had a fever, sore throat, everything hurt, i was dizzy if i stood up, and I couldn't remember anything that just happened to me (I drove home from school which is only a 2minute drive and I couldn't remember driving or how I drove when I pulled in my drive way). I found out that now I can't run outside in weather colder then 50 degrees and I get so winded like I can't breath even after five minutes of activity.

20090227153338AACsWGh	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Am I allergic to seafood?	I've always loved seafood, but lately I've been having some problems after i eat it.      I ate at Red Lobster about two months ago.  I got the fried flounder, and ate quite a bit, however about 1 hour later, I got horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea (sorry tmi).  I thought that maybe it was a bad piece of fish, so when my boyfriend decided to go there again a month later because he likes crab, I went, thinking that it was just random.  I ordered the flounder oven broiled and sure enough, one hour later, I had the same symptoms as before... but it was a month later, like stated..      Today i went out with a friend and we got crab rangoon from a chinese restaurant.  Same thing happened, about an hour later.      i don't make a habit out of eating seafood but every now and again, it sounds good.  I'm kind of afraid to do an experiment because of how bad I felt earlier and since I currently don't have insurance, I want to try to do this without a doctor at the moment.      I don't have any other symptoms.. just the cramps and... the other thing lol.  Am I allergic to seafood or is it just bad luck and bad fish?

Certain things would cause a rash but it would quickly go away. However; around 6 years old her rashes were getting worse. Then about 6 months ago she started having round rashes appear. They seem to grow slowly. Sometimes they are white scaly looking and some are bright red and even bleed a little. They all seem to be red when shes had a shower.  She gets other rashes but these concern me the most. The doctor said it was eczema. but she only looked at a couple of spots and asked few questions. She also told me nothing. She just prescribed a cream that's for various rashes. It doesn't really seem to be helping.   Anyone know what it might be? Eczema, psoriasis or even something else?

20090227161556AAH1CYK	Health;Mental Health	How to deal with 'problems'?	There is a girl in my form at school who has Aspergers, apparently anyway. She does a lot of things wrong, such as start shouting at people in the middle of lessons for 'looking at her', and this may make her violent. She also cries if you say something she disagrees with, or if a teacher tells her to get on with her work or whatever. She spreads rumours about herself, like that she's pregnant and stuff, every week, and if you try be her friend she stalks you, and touches you a lot. I mean like, constantly grabbing you and stroking you and stuff. Everyday people are getting more and more annoyed with her, and whenever we have a go at her back when she starts crying and lashing out at people when they say something she doesn't like, she gets us in trouble. And we get really told off. Is it just me or should she not be in a normal school with these kind of problems? She never gets told off as they use this to excuse everything she does, and everyone needs her to stop before they really snap and do something they'll regret. What could we do about this?

20090227162423AAB5WF7	Health;Mental Health	Suicide actually a positive option?	I hit the point today where i realized life doesn't magically get better on its own. I understand now that nothing is going to improve in my life by itself. And im okay with that... now. But seeing as im deathly afraid of people, or any social activity... I cant help but think the S word might actually be saving myself a lot of pain in the future. I know its hard for people to understand my situation with the little information ive provided, and despite the image of an everyday teenager on the internet begging for attention - I hate that i even had to post that word on a website. But i mean in the end, why does it have to be a sadistic, or a negative word. And don't get me wrong, i don't want to die, but the thought of continuing the lifestyle i have for another 60 - 80 years, and then dying, makes me sick to my stomach. And although i honestly am expecting immature answers - Id just like to add that im not really looking for a positive, you can do it! response to this question.        So honestly, and unbiasedly...       Why continue a meaningless life, if it cant be happy, and it cant contribute to our society. I realize they post this anti suicidal BS in our mainstream internet community via search engines... But i mean honestly? isn't that just the worlds way of attempting to save people who can actually contribute to society?

She doesn't seem very connected and personable with her patients.  This last week I've been hit twice by whatever is going around, the first time I got the flu n now a week later I'm sick with something else.. a really bad cold or something. So yesterday I had no voice n was coughing some so I couldn't work (receptionist, kinda need my voice) n went to the dr to get a dr note, told her of my history of the flu in the last week and my new cold n she prescribed me claritin and a Z-Pak antibiotics.     My cold started tuesday night, my throat started getting sore. Wednesday I felt really puny, slept pretty much all day, sore throat, some nasal congestion. Thursday nasal discharge clear to yellow/ coughin up yellow to brown mucus, throat still sore but not as bad, face feels full, ears full. Today Friday throat pretty much ok minor soreness, nasal discharge a bit less and clear to yellow, coughing more but not producing. Face still full/ears full.   I got the antibiotics last night at 7pm after going to the dr, it's noon the next day n I cant decide if I should take them.  I know the zpak is a pretty heavy duty deal.. I started the claritin n feel a bit better.  I don't want to have to take such a heavy antibiotic if I might not really need to, ya know?  Any advice?

20090227163541AAZnEga	Health;Mental Health	I need these people to realize that I'm not okay... how?	All last year I had been cutting myself, I saw 3 different councilors over the year, but only one really helped. I've thought about suicide A LOT the past few months, but about 3 weeks ago I actually attempted it. Obviously I failed, and I was sent to a psych ward in which i stayed for about a weeks time. I was tremendously scared when I left, because I knew that I was just going to attempt suicide again or start cutting myself again. But i've been out for 10 days, I have not attempted suicide and I ahve not cut myself. But I want to soo badly. It's all I think about. And the only reason I haven't attmepted suicide again, is because I don't think I could deal with it if I failed again, and now I actually have one or two people that I don't want to let down. I have a mental health nurse running around after me right now, waiting for my new councilor, and I also see my school counselor (the one who has helped the most, and i like the most) if I need to leave class. But everybody thinks I'm doing really well, and I'm progressing well. I'm not!! I want to kill myself! I haven't had even ONE proper counseling session since the first few days I was in hospital. So right now I'm not talking to ANYONE and it's sending me insane.   How can I let them know that I'm not doing well?!   I'm not really the sort of person who speaks up when they need help, so I'm afraid to ask them.    What should I do?
20090227165115AAcPIU8	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I want to die...I am hurt.?	I have these fabulous 3 friends, Esty, Karen, and Yuval. So I am very good friends with Esty.       But, I get mad at her quite often. I dont do it on purpose, I just can't forget about my madness. But, now I am mad at Esty again, and she did something VERY hurtful.       It might sound very weird now, but when it actually happened, it was worse and made me feel very bad.       We were in art class, and I told her to come sit beside me. She said no, and she always listens to what I say. Obviously, now that she didn't listen to what I said, it must have been a very good reason why she didn't. At the end, she said 'it was because Yuval would be alone.' I said 'Well, you dont care when I'm sitting alone, and you won't come or invite me there, but it matters alot when Yuvals alone?' She said yes, so I got really mad. I was sitting by myself at art, and when we went on a shocol feildtrip, she didn't even say hi or anything, and ignored me the whole time.       When I talked to her, she said it was because she didn't want to leave Yuval alone, but she had no problem with leaving me alone. That was what got me madder.       I have thought about npoot being friends with her anymore EVER again, like I have done MANY times with other friends. I have no problem doing that, because friends are supposed to take away your tears, not produce them.       But, the problem is that Esty is going to be with Yuval the whole time, and I don't want to hang out with her anymore.       So I don't know what to do.       I don't want to not hang out with Yuval.       I have Karen, but she can't be my only friend. I don't want to make new friends, because I am tired of changing friends every 6 months.       I also odn't think I will forgive Esty, she is causing me misery. But, when were not in fights, she is the BEST friend possible.      Tell me what to do!

Okay, so i know that this is mean of me but i just started going out with one of my bffs long time exes, we talked and she is fine about it, i mean we are only in 7th grade so of course it wasn't a serious relationship. so now i am going out with him. So then i was sitting in my major doing my work and everyone started talking trash about me going out with him, so i yelled "stop talking about me when i can hear you!" i stormed out of the class room sobbing like towards the end. so now 2 of the people who were talking about me (two of my best friends we will call jess, and sam) are beyond mad at me, they wont even talk to me. So i tried talking to them and it ended in tears and storming away. now flash forward a week, i have this friend (we will call her jen) was sitting in a different class talking to jess and sam, they started talking about me, and jen said "stop talking abou her like that!" now they hate her and me. did i mention that now the whole school hates me for liking him. so what kind of world do we live in where sticking up for one friend can make you lose two? so what do you think? what should i do? what kind of world do we live in where people hate you because you like some one? whos side would you pick? mine and jens or sams and jess'?

Its never a facial twitch, or a finger twitch, its always a limb or my head.   And it/they will move a pretty significant amount, like the amount you would raise your hand to wave at someone.   Mind you that this only happens on very rare occasions. It's only happened maybe 5 times in 4 years of smoking, and its only when i smoke a lot of high quality weed.   Please no comments trying to convince me to stop smoking entirely, they will be disregarded.   I'm not so interested in a cure as a diagnosis.

20090227163729AAniMoT	Health;Mental Health	School psychologist thinks my son has Asperger's Disease, I disagree?	My son is 11 now, in the 5th grade. The school psychologist, for some reason, thinks he has the Asperger's Disease. My son has always been somewhat timid and introverted, but has always had friends, and the descriptions of Asperger's that I read that describe the "one person birthday parties" do not describe him at all. In fact, he is quite well liked by his classmates and teachers, just a bit shy. He does not seem to "lack empathy"; in fact, I remember that during one birthday party when we were opening presents, he got a toy from our family friend which he already had, and he immediately ran to hide the original so they would not feel bad about getting him something he already had. Doesn't sound like a lack of theory of mind to me.      My son is quite bright and inquisitive, and it seems that this combination of shyness and intelligence is all it takes today to be labeled as autistic. I mean, so what if he doesn't like gym class? I was clumsy and bookish at his age too. He doesn't have ANY of these "sensory issues" that I've been reading about either. He does like to make lists, and can be stubborn at times, but just doesn't sound like the dysfunctional profile of Asperger's that I've been reading about online. Could this just simply be his personality?

20090227170451AAG8bIE	Health;Mental Health	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?  Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotist?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality.      How can the infinite pains of life be justified in comparison to the calm serenity of nonexistence? Has any man in history lived a life so blessed as to outweigh the pleasures of endless dreamless sleep? Is not man's greatest sin to have been born? What duty is there to continue to live? We did not choose to be born.      Why pass on genes, and sentence another generation to hell for the selfish pleasure of sexual desire?      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.      So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

I really can't get those ideas off my mind 24/7. Even if the thing isn’t not my fault and doesn’t have anything bad about it.. I will just pick a detail about something and keep on dwelling in it forever. Those incidents keep flashing in my head sometimes 4 or 5 at the same time one after another..not just that, I always keep thinking oh I did this it’s stupid so I’m stupid, He said that to me, he doesn’t respect me so I’m probably doing something wrong to make do that! This is really bothering me I started to doubt everything I do.. and every time I come home after school or after I talk to someone I start going through the things I did or I said right the way  and so on and then I pick something and it starts all over again I really don’t know what is wrong with me.. what is this called?

20070812094811AAWGWuD	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is this my plan something attainable??..pls pls read.?	Well am 20 years old, weigh about 160 lbs but want to go down to 145 lbs. I have tried some diets and they dont seem to work/ I dont stick to them. So now am thinking I need to overlook the whole 'more of this less of that' concept of things and just eat a balanced diet. I know it wont be easy because I definately eat more junkie type food than healthy the majority of the time. I want to begin with moderating my eating first then incorparate the excersice in so it wont be overwhelming. I think that my poor health affects me negatively(MENTALLY-sometimes am in a bad mood for no reason , my esteem isnt the worst but it could be better and am not motivated for anything!!, PHYSICALLY- I dont get enough sleep so that makes me stressed & very irritable, fragile hair,bland skin SOCIALLY- Confidence to interact with everyone etc) so am opting for a lifestyle change instead of just solely for weightloss but an overall improvement. Do you think my goals are too far fetched?Thanks in advance :)

I try my hardest to stay away from them.He has a very short fuse & gets pissed with me alot but always says he loves me so much, i don't know if i believe it though. I was once told by my mom who is really wild that " i bet he makes really good money. You can have a wild ride with a thug, but only if he fears you as much as he loves you.". I really need to understand something he did the other night, He came home i was on my way out with friends and he grabbed my arm and just kept staring at me & never said anything, i told him i was just going out with my friend eventually he let me go,What did he mean by doing that? i got terrified.Another day when i was going out he put me up against the wall. I know he has a tendency to be violent as i have seen him beat a guy just for bumping into me. Im only 25 i don't need to be scared of someone who is ment to love me. He has been arrested a few times.He has been arrested a few times. Help?

20090225102505AA6KBcM	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Any way to kill off the insulin producing area of your pancreas without killing the rest?	If you have reactive hypoglycemia that doesn't respond to diet, it makes your life a living hell. Wouldn't it be better to just become a diabetic and control your insulin via injections instead of constantly getting low blood sugar and adrenaline spikes? At least then you can keep your sugar up when you sleep instead of waking with an adrenal spike every 2-3 hours EVERY night from having low sugar?      We have worked with the top specialists at the University hospital and they can't stop the high insulin levels. They don't respond to meds and they have checked for insulin tumors and found nothing. When fasting, the levels remain normal but ANY food is a trigger for a massive dump of insulin. We have tried no carbs, minimal carbs, and no change.      So wouldn't it be preferred to be able to eat normal food again and sleep through the night as a trade off for diabetes?      My son is going thru hell with this and the Doctors won't do anything to help. They told him he will be a diabetic in less than 2 years at this rate because his pancreas will "burn out" but won't operate and just make it happen now so he can go back to a semi normal life.

My aunt asked her doctor and she said I could be pregnant, but i think that its impossible for me to be pregnant if i been bleeding for two months straight.       My questions are;  has anyone experienced this before? what was wrong? How did you fix it?      Information:    *I am 19 years old.    *I don't have health insurance because I cant afford it. (so please don't tell me to go to my doctor, if it was that easy i would of done that already)    *I have already been on birth control pills, patches and the Nuva Ring before (when i was younger)            Again only serious answers please, this is a serious matter to me.

20070520094235AAzGthQ	Health;Women's Health	Help?! What's happening with me???	I'm over 3 days late for my period. It's not odd for me to be early, but I'm normally not late. What's even more weird is the fact that I haven't really even had any signs I normally get when I'm about to have it in a matter of a few days or so. Last week, I had a bit of cramping, but nothing happened after it. It hasn't happened since. I haven't had any "activity" (as in sexual) lately. I'm concerned that my body is just trying to "tell" me now that something is going on. Back in February, I ended up having to take Plan B just a few days after an incident. I had my period on time that month. The next month I did too. The following month (april), I was only 1 day late. I didn't really think anything of it since I was on time. My period was a little bit lighter than usual and didn't last as long (it'd end about a day or 2 sooner when my normal is 5 days). Is it possible that I'm pregnant and haven't even realized it?! Would I feel any different if I were 3 mons. pregnant right now?

So, if us women can take a "load" in our mouths... and swallow it... and even lick our fingers after fingering ourselves in front of you men,,,,      Why would a snowball be gross or why do men think it's so gross to even think about having a partial bit of their own jucies in their own mouths (even if it came from their own bodies)?      I asked my husband this... and all I got was "CAUSE IT'S GROSS! WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THIS!??"      Personally, I don't mind either... I just can't get over the idea that a guy has such a phobia about it!       I don't understand why!

Alle elementari, per esattezza in quarta elementare, facemmo dei laboratori! io fui assegnato al laboratorio di "poesia"! dopo due settimane di lezioni sulla poesia, ci chiesero di scrivere una poesia! Ebbene, scrissi una poesia sulla nebbia, di cui non ricordo il testo per intero, ma la parte finale si! La maestra rimase sbalordita, tanto da sputtanarmi all'intera classe docente, che ogni qualvolta mi vedevano mi chiamavano "il piccolo poeta"! La sfortuna però si accanì su di me, la poesia che scrissi, la persi!!! e come molti poeti maledetti, la mia precocità mi costò cara!! la mia carriera di poeta durò poco! questo è un mio piccolo rimpianto, non aver potuto sfruttare quella che poteva essere una mia piccola dote!! e voi cosa avete da rimpiangere??? e in cosa da piccoli, eravate definiti piccoli fenomeni???
