nlMfJtxcaa	Westminster is an AKC show in the United States. Crufts is a KC show in England. Both are very prestigious to win, but since they are in separate countries judged with different rules and sometimes different breed standards, it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges.<br>  <br>  However Crufts pulls in a much larger entry so a win at Crufts would be "bigger" in numbers alone.|`|91CX5jHaaa	In my opinion, either is just as prestigious.|`|FdcWPp48aa	IMO Crufts|`|sQOXjKFNaa	I m for the Us I pick westminster!!|`|AA10412922	Crufts had 22,677 entries,Westminster had just over 2,500.Enough said
AA12237148	When correcting your dog never use their name. Always use a firm no when correcting him. And you were right to have your boyfriend put him down and not praise him|`|b6LYXThDaa	Dogs like you when you feed them its what i did with mine|`|8XigtCWGaa	He will probably protect the one that babies him and gives him treats..|`|xWNLHMMcaa	your dog is taking to your boyfriend more then you. you need to show your dog that your the master not your boyfriend. try picking him up and petting him more. show him you love him. sometimes dogs take to guys more then women. im not sure why i think it might be our deep voice when we say a command.  good luck|`|KuiuUtY5aa	well, were you gentle? u need to be gentle no matter how old.if u hit tigger he wont like u much.my dog peco growl wen i pet him for no reason but i still love him!:)|`|IROLLdMIaa	he is protective of him lol|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Yeah sounds like he was trying to be protective. You are right in thinking that you need to stop this. I saw on the "it's me or the dog" with snapping, while being held like that, like you said, he must be put straight on the floor. And, you have to practice this a lot. The reason they will stop doing it after a while is that they want to be held by the person they are protecting, but realise they aren't going to hold them if they snap at others.|`|dYGT38Cqaa	Your dog likes your boyfriend more than you and he was probably telling you to back off...that he was comfortable...and maybe wanted all of your boyfriend's attention to himself. <br>  It's definitely kinda strange though and your boyfriend needs to co-operate with you in teaching your dog that the growl is not going to be tolerated. They do get it but they can't be sent mixed signals. Tell your boyfriend it's you or the dog. lol ...but then again he might opt for your dog...better not go there. lol

Some people do not believe in giving dogs bones but mine loves the marrow bones (soup) and he doesn't get them everyday and only supervised so I will continue to give them to him|`|sdWfyq2naa	go to your local grocery store and ask the butcher to cut you fresh ones, we pay any where from .99 to 1.99.  very cheap and you can usually get 3 to four of them.  our rottie loves them too!  another one the butcher told us about and my dog loved them too, was the t-bone, not much more where price is concerned, i think it was 2.00 for 2 of the bones. hope this helps. the beef soup bones will last longer then the t-bone ones. we had a lab too, she just got put down last may!  :( they are great dog's, enjoy!
FtBqmFDEaa	You accidentally posted this in the bird section did you realise, probably because the word Zebra (finch) is in the title. <br>  <br>  Sometimes small fish die for no reason, especially fast moving fish like danios, its like they just come to the end of their life cycle all of a sudden.  I doubt it was eating the cucumber that did it, fish aren't stupid they don't eat things that make them sick. I put cucumber in for my plec and my platys and guppies eat it but not the danios or tetras. <br>  <br>  If its obviously dying and suffering then you should take it out and humanely kill it by knocking it on the head with a blunt object to stop its suffering. Not nice to do but think of the fish not yourself.  I had to euthanize a small goldfish in my pond today, it was floating on its side and its tail at been completely eaten away by fungus. Its a huge pond 20ft x 12ft and I hadn't seen this small brown fish amongst the pond weed before anyone comments about taking more notice.|`|1BdUkF0zaa	I have fish and you might want to put him in a bowl or something so if he is sick he wont infect any of the others. Also i hear cut up peas is like medicine for fish. Look on the internet to see what could of caused that. I don't think the cucumber could of did it if all the other fish or ok.
0lnamekJaa	It depends on what kind of snake it was... <br>  <br>  Take your cat to the Humane Society or Anti Cruelty and they should treat your cat on a sliding scale...<br>  <br>  Please take your kitty in to a charitable organization... they will help you pay!|`|m16gf9mzaa	I had a cat once who got bit by a snake - probably a rattlesnake of some kind.  I did not take her to the vet right away because I only saw one mark, and thought she had been stung by a scorpion. I did call the vet - it was after hours, and the vet said if I was sure there was only one mark it was probably scorpion, and so I could wait and make a follow-up appointment during regular office hours a few days later.   She lived despite the lack of care.  In Arizona, where we lived at the time, there is an old wives' tale that says  cats can take up to three snake bites in a life time.  By the time I did get her to the vet, the swelling had gone down enough that the vet found the other three marks. At that point, she had already dealt with the venom, and the only treatment was an antibiotic to keep the bite wound from getting infected.  <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to beg or borrow to get your cat the veterinary care that she needs.  But if you have truly exhausted all possibilities, then the thing to do is, do NOT try to squeeze the venom out.  This will only serve to irritate the wounds worse.  Do clean out the puncture marks, and do what you can to prevent infection at the site.  You can use half and half water and hydrogen peroxide to clean the wounds.  Do keep kitty calm, and restrict her activity level for the next few days, while her body works to process the toxin.  <br>  <br>  I cannot promise you your cat will be ok like mine was.  That is why I strongly encourage you to do whatever you can to get your cat to the vet, as soon as possible.  But I also know, through my own stupidity, that a snake bite is not necessarily a death sentence for a cat.|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	Take your cat to the vet.  Payment is expected when treatment is finished, so when you are standing at the counter and they've brought your cat to you, say you forgot your purse in the rush to get him help.  Then leave.  You can call them later to make payment arrangements.  It's sneaky and you may not be welcomed back as a patient, but kitty will get the medical care they need. <br>  <br>  In the United States, there are several common poisonous snakes. Rattlesnakes, water moccasins, copperheads, and coral snakes are all poisonous. It is estimated that at least 90 percent of cat’s that are bit by a snake are bit on the head or leg. Bites to a cat’s body are almost always fatal. If you cat is bit on any part of its body, it is necessary to get your cat to medical treatment within thirty minutes. Because cats are much smaller than humans, any snakebite can cause serious damage. <br>  <br>  When at cat suffers from a snake bit, your cat will have severe pain and immediate swelling. The symptoms of snakebite will depend on the type and size of the snake. With rattlesnakes, copperheads and moccasins, your cat will first experience restlessness, panting, drooling and general weakness of the body. This is usually followed by collapsing, seizures, and severe diarrhea. In very severe cases, the cat will go into shock and die. With a coral snake, cats will have less swelling and pain. Although these bites are still very serious, the symptoms will not be as severe. Instead, venom from the snake will affect the nervous system and cause vomiting, incontinence, paralysis, convulsions and sometimes coma. <br>  <br>  If you know your cat has been attacked by a snake and are not sure whether or not the snake is poisonous, it is recommended to get your cat to veterinarian treatment within thirty minutes. There are many 24-hour pet clinics that can treat serious medical conditions. Call ahead to let them know you are on the way. Treatment is critical for a cat that has been bitten by a poisonous snake. <br>  <br>  If it is not possible to get your cat to treatment within that time frame, there are a couple of things you can do to help your cat. The most important step to take is to gently, but firmly restrain your cat. Try to keep calm. A stressed cat will be much harder to handle. You cat will already be in severe pain, so it will be important to treat your cat gently. Also, movement in your cat will make the venom spread more quickly causing more damage. If your cat is moving or struggling too much, try wrapping your cat firmly in a towel. <br>  <br>  The next step to take is to locate the exact place of the bit. Snakebites are usually characterized by two evenly spaced fang marks. There will be redness and swelling in this area. Next, you must wrap the area with bandages. If the bite is on the leg, constrict the leg by wrapping a bandage between the leg and the cat’s heart. Do not wrap it so tightly that is constricts blood flow. Make sure you can slip one finger under the bandages. Loosen the bandage for five minutes every hour. Get to the pet hospital as soon as possible so the cat can be treated properly. <br>  <br>  When your cat gets snakebite, do not wash the wound or apply ice. This can increase the absorption of the venom making your cat sicker. Also it is not recommended to cut the wound or to try to suck out the venom.|`|RebEfrisaa	I'm no vet, but would pin point where the bite occurred and squeeze out the venom as soon as possible. Try to get everything out then put some peroxide on it to clean the best that you can. Hope your cat feels better. :(|`|6emxR9pQaa	Do you know the type of snake your cat was bitten by?|`|4yt4D3vMaa	If it was a poisonous snake start digging a hole......|`|6FRZfzyFaa	was it bitten by a poisonis snake?!?!?!... butwrap a towel around the kitty and take a clean wet cloth and slightly wipe its bite... and you also NEED to get money for the vet... ask family to lend it to you or friends... or anyone you know who is a cat lover.... but you really need a vet.
769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	Yes, you can.  It takes time and patience and the end result will not be the same as walking a dog.  Cats spend time outside on a leash, while dogs actually walk and run with their owners.  <br>  <br>  Here's How: <br>  1.  Purchase a comfortably-fitting harness and lightweight leash with a secure clip. Do not use a collar, as the cat may be able to slip out of it. You want the leash to pull from the chest rather than the throat. <br>  <br>  2. Put the harness and leash somewhere near kitty's sleeping area and leave it there for several days to accustom him to it's appearance and smell. <br>  <br>  3. Wait until just before his normal mealtime, then put the harness on the cat. <br>  <br>  4. You should be able to comfortably slip two fingers between the harness and his skin.  Immediately feed him his favorite meal and praise him when he is finished. <br>  <br>  5. Let him wear the harness for awhile. If it seems to bother him, distract him by playing with a favorite toy. <br>  <br>  6. When your cats seems to be accustomed to the harness, take it off. <br>  <br>  7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 for several days, leaving the harness on longer each time. <br>  <br>  8. Next, attach the leash to the harness and let kitty walk around the house, dragging the leash. Watch him carefully that he doesn't get tangled up around furniture. <br>  <br>  9. Praise him for being such a good cat, and give him some loving hugs. <br>  <br>  10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for a few days, until the cat seems to accept the harness and leash. <br>  <br>  11. Now, let him walk around as usual, but pick up the business end of the leash and follow him in his wanderings. Keep the tension slack, so as not to restrict his movement. <br>  <br>  12. Practice step 11 for a few days. <br>  <br>  13. Teach kitty to follow you by talking to him in a cajoling manner and lightly pulling on the lead. Don't fight him. You want him to want to follow you. <br>  <br>  14. You're ready to move outdoors now. Do it gradually, and take your first short excursions in your own back yard, or in a quiet area. <br>  <br>  15. Gradually increase his exposure to the sights, sounds and smells of the outdoors. Soon, the two of you will be able to enter walkathons together. <br>  <br>  Tip: <br>  Patience, patience, patience. Stay tuned to your cat's reactions and let him guide you at his own pace. Don't let this training become a battle of the wills, because you will surely lose.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If you mean like a dog walking on leash, no.  But if you mean to just wear a harness/leash and you go outside and walk around with him (him leading) then yes.<br>  <br>  I trained my one and only indoor/outdoor cat who was several years old to wear a harness/leash when outside.<br>  <br>  But don't expect them to be like a dog and take a walk around the block.|`|xgKQrEhqaa	I was able to train both my kittens to adjust to the halter and leash.  She was easier because she started at 4 months, he was a little slower at 9 months.  by being slower she accepted it the first time, him the 4th time.  They even now help me put the harness on.  Training them to walk is a different story.  They pretty much go where they want when they want.  He is actually easier to lead, but then he comes when I call him any way.  Make sure you never tug on the leash and you won't have any problems at all.  Oh and a treat when they put it on and take it off helps in the beginning too.|`|3mu1IWTzaa	at 10 months, that's not really a kitten-however, I began training my cat at 2 months and after getting used to the harness-not just a collar, an "h" harness- it's just lots of patience. 2 clicks to walk,, stop! to stop,ye's, even 'sit'-but cats are not dogs; don't wear out their patience.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	cats are extremely hard to train. I tried to have mine walk on a leash but they just won't do it, so I gave up. <br>  If you manage to do it, let me know, lol.<br>  Good luck!!
6SeWCfUfaa	Pasta isn't really good for anyone.  Carb city!!  <br>  <br>  But no, it's not really good for dogs.  It won't kill them, but I wouldn't feed it to them on a regular basis.|`|6OyPLwH2aa	i dont think so....but??|`|xWNLHMMcaa	no. someone told me it binds them up.
tMtBe1lKaa	If you have a tank that is already set up, and has been for some time, you can put the new fish in, but if you would have to set up a new system, then it would have to cycle or the ammonia and nitrites might kill your new fish anyway. <br>  Is the fish swimming okay? If it is, just rearange the tank so they don't have set territories anymore. That will decrease "fish on fish violence". If not, and you don't have a tank set up already, you could go to the store and get a breeding cage- it's a small box that sits in the aquarium the fish are in. This would be a good hospital for the injured fish until the fins heal. <br>  Best of luck.|`|4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	You need to be sure to keep the water very very clean.  I would change the water everyday or every other day until your little fishy gets better.  Is the new tank fully cycled or is it a new set up?  No one can tell you if your fish will die or not.  It is highly likely that it will but sometimes these little fin friends surprise us.  Make sure that it is getting enough food and that it is eating the food and not letting it sink to the bottom.  Remove all uneaten food so it doesnt build up toxins in your water.  You could add some fin repair stuff to help him along.  Before getting a new pet fish, please read everything you can about its needs and proper tank mates.  Not sure why your guppy tried to eat his new tankmate without knowing what kind of fish he is.  <br>  <br>  best of luck to you and your little finless fishy|`|CfZtYxS2aa	I know that this doesn't help your question directly, but just remember that if any of your new fish die within 30 days (I think that's how many days it is, sorry if I'm wrong!) and go back to PetSmart with them and get a refund (just don't forget your receipt!) Also if you aren't sure what type of fish are compatible with guppies, go back to them and ask them what types of fish that they recommend that go with guppies. Hope this helps!|`|kwHIpsTRaa	Well you cant really save a fish from dieing, but its good that you changed the tank. If the gill gets [bit or scrached] then they can die because it effects there breathing, it has happend to my fish. So im not sure.|`|l3IHlxylaa	well guppies are not aggresive fish at all so get anything that's a tropical community fish those wont pose a threat to the guppies. try anything that's a tetra or even a red platy. you probably cant save a fish from death. sorry|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Add aquarium salt to the tank. This will help ward off infection while his fin heals. All you can really do is just see what happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|OK8GpIeXaa	if they like bit it off u have to take it to a vet for surgery cause it must be effecting it's breathing problems. i suggest u take her to the vet right away before something serious happens.
5vyNGRONaa	Lol He will still be energetic and happy.|`|90CPrvV3aa	so do i ...<br>  <br>  i dont think he will|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	He might stop, he might need correcting to stop doing it.. It's a dominance behaviour not  a sexual behaviour.|`|SgeIPqKlaa	. . . . . . .<br>  well, i don't know if your visitors would enjoy your dog doing that to them.. . but ok. .  neutering probably will change this, but getting him neutered is better for him in the long run.  if he is not neutered, he could develop cancer.  i think he would enjoy getting fixed and not humping more than having cancer!!!!|`|9kcFo2alaa	Yes it will. He will be less aggressive. He will be more calm.|`|AA11244754	yes it will because it's a sign of domination.|`|RkG93ZqBaa	there is a good chance it will but not a 100% chance you can also do training to stop the behavore since most people dont enjoy being humped by a dog
1BdUkF0zaa	I have owned a parakeet for a few months and he wont even come on my finger. I let mine fly in my living room because there's lots of room for him to fly around and places for him to land. If there new to flying yea that's probably normal. Hoped that help.|`|b3ZLY5osaa	thats a really good question that i want to know to any one know? :( my parakeet does the same thing|`|7MzldDHYaa	Yes,it can hurt him.I know someone that had a parakeet that totally broke and paralized his wings by running into a window.Be careful and just make sure you close your windows,close the blinds,and cover your tv.You can also seek an avian vet and ask questions about that...well...good luck!|`|UdHnRULiaa	keep track of him. and possibly clip his wings so he can run around the room rather than fly
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	My boy will lay on my feet, then roll over onto his back so he can stare at me.  Every time he does that, I know he wants to eat :)|`|YRJFo6K0aa	I don't own ferrets myself, but I used to work with the wildlife department of a museum that had several of them. For Halloween one year we made them Jack-O-Lanterns as an enrichment, and they were so cute climbing around all over them. There's nothing like a Jack-O-Lantern with a sleeping ferret hanging out of its mouth.|`|fU06Qre9aa	Sleep with his tongue sticking out :)
nFcl0BOsaa	Dogs don't have hands, it is normal for them to explore and manipulate the world around them with their mouths. However, he needs to be taught appropriate social behavior.  When he bites you, yelp "ow!" in a high-pitched voice, turn away and go do something else, ignoring him for 10 minutes or so. The more consistent you are, the sooner he will learn to be gentle.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	There is nothing wrong with a calm dog. Its his personality. It sounds like play biting to me if that is the only time he does it. If it gets aggressive, wapp him on the nose (not too hard) and say "NO".|`|R4v5lqP5aa	i had this same prob too when i got my puppy. Right now your dog is nipping because he is teething... buy a simi-soft chew toy at the pat store. When he starts nipping when you play with him, give him the toy right away so he understands that biting the toy is ok, but biting you is not. As for the calmness... both breeds are pretty chill, so i think thats normal. Jus make sure he is getting all his vitamins and you should be fine. :-)|`|QzlpIZkTaa	hi i was watching cesar milan and he like bites them back but like with his hand but to use it like a bite,dont feel sorry for him he lives in the now not in the past like us humans live in both he doesnt<br>  REMEMBER EXCERSIZE DISAPLINE AFFECTION<br>  it works wounder|`|gpoi6GKtaa	calm dogs are always good you got lucky on that one- as far as his biting goes- put  some change in a metal can with a lid and when he nips shake it it usually scares them and eventually they learn to stop nipping
TSttBTAgaa	a betta belly size is about two time it eye. You can throw in 14-16 for starting if they can't finish all in 5 minute, try 12-14 for the next meal.
k4pFHtXDaa	It sounds like your cat may have been in a fight with another male.  I would have a vet look at the wound right away as it could be an abscess and turn into a horrible infection quickly.  I don't mean to alarm you but it could be a serious thing if not taken care of correctly.  If your cat is an outdoor and indoor cat it could catch a disease with a wound like that and transmit it to any other cats living in the home.  The best thing to do is take it to the vet as soon as possible.  Also I wouldn't let him outside until you know for sure what it is.  The hair loss is most likely from scratching it as it may itch as it heals.  The pus also means an infection usually so I would definitely take him to the vet.  I wish you both well and God Bless you both.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	He probably got into a fight or has a blowfly larva in his neck ( if it is warm where you live.) Either way,he needs to see a vet for treatment or he could die from infection, and he needs to be neutered and kept indoors. If you had a pus-covered hole in your neck,wouldn't you go to the doctor?|`|118h96Q8aa	Well, either he got into a fight, or he has a skin condition. Personally, as a groomer, I think it's a skin condition. You may think about taking him to the vet to see if he needs antibiotics or special shampoos to help treat the problem. This is actually fairly common in outdoor cats. Does it's fur feel greasy? Is there dandruff?
KuiuUtY5aa	does your dog go outside alot? it might get smelly out there.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	There are some breeds that smell doggier than others because of hair coats or skin conditions.<br>  <br>  There are some dogs that smell doggier than they need to because of what they're being fed.<br>  <br>  My dog doesn't smell real doggy because I keep him clean and I keep my house clean.  <br>  <br>  And yes, I always find that other people's houses smell different than my own.  I can't stand to be in houses where people have cats.  The litter box smell makes me sick.|`|iasOicRjaa	Its you....properly cared for dogs do not smell bad.<br>  <br>  Each house does have its own smell....it is based on all the different smells of the home...cleaning supplies, foods cooked, textiles used etc....take my hose for example...it smells like Vanilla (candles and air vent fresheners are all vanilla scented) and coffee (a pot in the am and a pot in the afternoon)<br>  <br>  My friends house smells like bacon and old beer....|`|xWNLHMMcaa	dogs just have that natural dog smell. its in the oils in there hair. you can bath them but in a day there going to smell again. you can try different powders on them. i think they sell that kind of stuff at the pet store.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Smell their feet. They smell like popcorn!|`|cnZlMojUaa	I do think every person and I would guess animals also, have a unique smell. I honestly think I could be blindfolded and pick my husband out of a crowd. <br>  <br>  Healthy dogs shouldn't "stink". They may have a slight odor, but shouldn't smell bad. If they do, I would check for a dental problem, ear problem or anal gland problem. These can cause some smelly funk. Also, some dogs will have a stronger scent when wet. Poor quality food or poor grooming (long hair dog without a sanitary trim where feces can stick) can also cause an odor. Dogs with deep wrinkles may have smells related to yeasty infections in the folds. My Scotties don't have a bad odor and they are not bathed frequently. They actually smell pleasant and when wet smell like their shampoo. Some hound breeds have a stronger odor, but again, should not stink.<br>  <br>  A home typically will have a signature smell as well. I know that when I go to visit my mom, her house has a special smell--a nice smell that speaks home to me. I don't honestly notice my home's smell.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	It's just you.. My dogs don't smell..

I mean, my dogs get smelly, but then they get bathed and they don't smell anymore.<br>  <br>  Also, what you feed your dog can directly affect its smell, believe it or not.

H06PtiIAaa	to help kill ich, you need to raise the temperature, it wont kill ich but it will speed up the life cycle which is better for the fish.<br>  <br>  also add aquarium salt, ich is a freshwater parasite can cant live in water that has salt.<br>  <br>  Also i treat my tanks with jungle buddies ich clear, basically it helps prevent secondaryy infections.|`|AA11901352	Sounds a bit too late for the temperature raise here.<br>  <br>  Get medicine.  do not add salt do not raise the temperature unless the directions on the medicine states to do so.<br>  <br>  Also, you changed the water, did you remove all the water?  Water changes are 25% once per week.  Removing all the water isn't getting rid of the ich parasite since it is already in the water source.  Fish get ich when they are stressed.  If you are changing all the water out of the tank when you clean it, you are not allowing the beneficial bacteria to build up subjecting your fish additional stress and poor water conditions.  The tank needs to remain cycled.<br>  <br>  Get the medicine. It may take a week or more to rid the tank of ich.<br>  <br>  Also here is a site that explains why you should not remove all the water in the tank.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a>|`|Ho00LuMvaa	i would get medicine if i were you but id take them  to perco or something because i had the same problem i had to flush em.:(|`|ZYzhBhgJaa	The majority of info I've come across says that quick cure is the best treatment for ich.

Just take good care of him and he will know you love him. Make sure he gets plenty of exercise. You don't want to spoil him too much.

hbj6vGE4aa	You really don't need to be exercising a four month old pup.  It can cause undue stress on the growing joints and can indeed cause development issues.<br>  <br>  Switch her to a high protein adult food when she is around 6-8 months old.  I would wait until she is one year before doing anything too strenuous.  <br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that you can't run with her, she does need to wear herself out.  Just don't overdo it.<br>  <br>  Have a good time, that sounds like fun.  Have you ever heard of skijoring?|`|1WmDOPGtaa	This type of exercise is far too strenuous for a 4 month old pup.  With a young dog, you want to stick to free exercise.  This is generally done off leash (or on a long line) and allows the dog to set his/her own pace and stop when they are tired.  Compare this with forced exercise, such as running/biking/sledding with the dog (generally on leash).  In this scenario the dog is forced to keep your pace and keep going until you decide it's time to stop.  There is far too much risk of overrunning the dog.  Pulling against resistance should also be avoided at this point (within reason - a little game of tug-o-war is far different from pulling a sled).  As for surface types, you want to stick to soft surfaces at this time.  Grass, sand, snow, and dirt are all good.  Pavement is a no-no when it comes to running puppies.  Now all of this can be reevaluated when your dog is fully mature.  It's best to wait 14-18 months and the key is to start easy and work your way up slowly.  You would also do well to have the dog's hips and elbows x-rayed and evaluated by an orthopedic specialist (or better yet, OFA) to make sure the dog is sound enough for this activity.<br>  <br>  Pups that are put through too strenuous a workout can develop any number of joint issues, including dysplasia of the hips or elbows.  There are probably little things you can do now to start getting her ready for the sport like getting used to a special harness and being comfortable around the sled.  Lots of positive associations.  Good luck!
GGlFHz7waa	Maybe you should put your cat in a separate room from you and let her nurse her kittens for a few days. They're very sensitive about their new borns. Just leave food/water nearby for her but don't get too close to her kittens|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	It sounds like mastitis.  Inflammation and infection caused by a blocked mammary gland.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you can't get your cat to a vet, but are you or your family able to afford about ￡5?    If you are, then the best product to cure your cat are Phytolacca Tablets which are specifically designed to cure mastitis.  <br>  <br>  The Phytolacca tablets are made by Weleda and are sold in the Homoeopathic Range in Boots the Chemists.  You need to ask for Phytolacca 6c.<br>  <br>  If you are not able to get to Boots, then you can buy them from this website<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Weleda_Phytolacca_Tablets__7029596" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.co.uk/Weleda_Phytolacca_...</a><br>  <br>  If you are able to get the tablets, crush one up and sprinkle it on her food 3 times a day.    <br>  <br>  Your cat will be in considerable discomfort with the mastitis and that is why she is meowing so much. I hope you can persuade your family to help her.<br>  <br>  I'm sure your cat really appreciates you caring about her so much.|`|UtwcSsfpaa	Is she nursing her kits on her heathy-looking teats?<br>  <br>  You should probably bring her to the vet so that they can check to make sure that the problem teat isn't infected or something.|`|AA11790326	you need to take her to the vet.
0AEi70ywaa	I wouldn't worry but I would definitely work to correct this behavior.  In a pack, the leader (you) have first dibs on any and all food.  Even if the pek is in the middle of eating you have to right to go and stick your hand in the bowl and stand over it and force him away.<br>  <br>  The best way to work on this is to place the bowl on the floor but do not allow the dog to approach until you say it is allowed.  Do this by giving a wait or stay command then physically standing over the food bowl.  If the dog tries to get to it, turn so your legs block access.  Only when you say "okay" or "done" or some other release word may they eat "your" food.<br>  <br>  I think it is very important to establish this dominance over your dog as it can help curb other behavioral issues as well!  You're not being mean, you're just being a good pack leader!  <br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't say this is a pek specific problem, it's just a dog behavior.  Some dogs guard resources and others don't.  Perhaps she does the same thing with toys?|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Do not worry about this. This is normal with dogs. They have instincts to protect their food. It's no big deal. Unless they try to bite anyone or do anything too serious, scold them and say no.|`|SQs1aiIIaa	I had one too who every time we would put her food down she would bark and growl at anyone who got near her or her food. All dogs get like that it is in there nature to defend things so don't  worry to much about it ok.
H06PtiIAaa	again you dont understand the fact that nano reefs are difficult to care for,<br>  <br>  But if you must.<br>  <br>  i love how you send me an email about not getting live sand or live rock probably because of the price and then wanting to somehow get a reef tank where the lighting is around 100-200 dollars at least, where you physically cant get corals without live rock. <br>  <br>  'Yes it is expensive. but thats fishkeeping.<br>  <br>  puffers and clownfish dont mix, your puffer will pick on the clown and eventually kill it.  <br>  <br>  so mistake number one.<br>  <br>  even a 30 is still not a beginner tank you will need to do weekly maintence with daily testing of the water. <br>  <br>  <br>  GET Live sand and live rock, basically you  want reef but dont want these two fundamental reef components...  thats crazy talk.<br>  <br>  You need to learn to follow before you can lead, and you need to know saltwater before you can cut corners. kinda of like wanting it all without paying your dues.<br>  <br>  basically you have two options, if you go reef in a nano tank, you have to cut the puffer... all puffers are not reef safe as the will pick on fish and corals. <br>  <br>  or just stick with the brackish puffer in the 10 gallon.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: and for prices, if you want to do everything right, at least 600 dollars. My reef tanks are around 1000-5000 dollars ea.|`|tMtBe1lKaa	You're going to spend money no matter how you do it, and reef tanks are expensive. <br>  A 10 gallon reef or even a 30 gallon reef is considered "expert level". If you're new, try a larger tank. It's more expensive, but often you can go to www.craigslist.com or advertise in your local classifieds and get a complete reef set up at a fraction of the price from people who are moving or getting out of the hobby.<br>  Put your puffer in your 30. he needs more room.

AA10766729	Learn to "ride the gait."  In other words, you need to keep yourself above the saddle and learn to bounce with the motion of the horse.   Try shortening your stirrups a bit to get you a little extra leg room for the motion as well.<br>  <br>  And just as side note, I doubt it's hurting your vagina, as that is INSIDE your body.  It's more likely causing pain to your pelvic bone, your labia, your vulva and those areas.  Please learn proper terminology to avoid embarrassment later on.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Either you aren't sitting the horse correctly, or you aren't riding a saddle that fits you, or both. Try a different saddle first as that's easier. When you first start riding correctly your legs hurt because you are using muscles you don't normally use. When those leg muscles hurt, you'll know you are doing it right.|`|gNfKqZzaaa	im guessing its the saddle. try sitting more on your butt rather than your woohoo.|`|b3ZLY5osaa	maybe its your saddle, i rode on a saddle that was small for me it hurt|`|3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	try wearing padded bicycling shorts under your pants.

Mcf33eLbaa	Depending on when your dog ate it you need to give it 24 hours to see if it will go through her system.<br>  Just as was said earlier, no appetite, lethargy along with discoloration of the gums is normally a good sign that you need to get to the vet pronto.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|o93EwErKaa	You are the best person to judge if something is wrong with your dog.  When you say her breathing is more shallow, I am a little concerned that the bag may be in her esophagus and you may have a partial  airway obstruction.<br>  <br>  Usually within 2 hours a foreign object has already passed into her intestines so I think an emergency clinic would advise you to check her stools for passage unless they think it is hung up prior to entering the stomach.  Usually with an obstruction, the dog will not eat, and will vomit.  The vomit may start off as bile, but will escalate to vomit that is brown and smells like feces.  A partial obstruction can pass liquids (diarrhea), but a complete obstruction cannot pass anything.  It takes a while for some things to exit so you may have several days of worry ahead of you.  Many vets advise vaseline sandwiches to help pass the object more quickly from the body.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Throwing up, refusal to eat and drink.  Lethargy.

RA3p25Qoaa	The extra shells should vary in sizes mostly close to the size of their current shell. If the shell is way too big get some that are slightly smaller than the current shell. But focus on the shape of the opening they tend to like the same shape opening.  3 shells per crab or more is best. Make sure they are non-painted and boiled to clean them out. Buying them at craft stores is much cheaper. <br>  <br>  As for when they will switch hermit crabs switch when ever they feel like it. Shell changes are not always based on size, they just have to feel safe and be in the mood to switch.|`|9p7eUgYqaa	Big|`|r9lfDeRmaa	You should always keep a variety of empty shells (preferably bigger than the one it has at the present) in the cage with the hermit crab, as it grows it will venture out of the shell it has and try out new ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can purchase empty shells from any Pet Store that sells Hermit Crabs, we get ours from PetCo.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	It climbs out of it's old shell and goes hunting for a new one.|`|9cPNA4nKaa	it will get its own|`|Lvmpn4EPaa	when it comes off|`|SwTgUf89aa	it willl come out of its shell when it gets too small for itt.. and then be sure to go right out and get a slightly bigger shell for it.. orr u can get a slightly bigger shell and put it in the cage and it willgo into it when the time is right|`|TiJpT1z3aa	when it leaves his shell and burrows in the sand. <br>  <br>  get a new shell quick because without one it can die.|`|t8BE8B9Aaa	it might just die like mine did i had a bigger shell in the cage but he never got in it
fgxajTiBaa	If many of his teeth are rotten than that would be why it's so expensive. A normal dental scaling shouldn't cost you this much.<br>  <br>  If a dogs teeth rot, it inhibits their ability to eat. Also, if it's bad enough bacteria can seep into their blood stream, which is usually fatal.<br>  <br>  So it is possible for a dog to die from a lack of proper dental care. However, buy your dog some nice raw meaty knuckle bones and that should help some. Unless he's already to the point of all his teeth needing to be pulled. If you can't afford the care you could maybe look into a carecredit card and put the vet costs onto that and make it in payments.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Would it be worth changing the dog's diet to one that will help to keep his teeth and gums clean naturally?  Obviously it won't help with abscesses and already rotten teeth but a diet of raw meat and edible bones will greatly improve the health of your dog's mouth.  <br>  <br>  The large chunks of meat polish and floss the teeth while the bones help scrape off the tartar.  Large weight bearing bones like shins and knuckles can crack or break teeth - meaty bones like chicken thighs are a much better option.<br>  <br>  I'm not suggesting this as a 'cure-all' but as a 'may improve' measure while you look for another options such as a more reasonable vet bill - that price is horrendous..|`|91CX5jHaaa	That seems a little high to me for dental work, but a lot does depend on your location.  You might want to try CareCredit, or ask your vet iof they are AAHA participants.  There are a couple programs that can help you out if you are on a fixed income.|`|iasOicRjaa	That is very high for a dental....try shopping around for a cheaper price on the vet work he needs.<br>  <br>  Even if you do find a cheaper price you may also want to look into a program called Care Credit...it is a service you apply for they pay your vet bill and then you pay it back...and you get 1 year interest free to pay it back. We offer that at my clinic and it has helped so many people and pets...worth a shot :-)|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Hmmm, you must live in a big city.  Out here a full dental + teeth extraction is about $95-125.  Shop around!  It would probably be worth the drive out to a rural area if you can get better prices.|`|fTQmn5V3aa	I'm so sorry you are faced with this.<br>  <br>  Check to see if you have a veterinarian school within reasonable distance. You can often get work done at such a school - students do the work under the supervision of their professors.<br>  <br>  Also, don't hesitate to shop around. I live in upstate New York, and I recently paid about $275 for my elderly rat terrier's dental work. This included his pre-op blood work, two extractions, anesthesia, and follow-up medications (antibiotic and pain killer).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|b3ZLY5osaa	how bad of teeth? we brush our dogs teeth you can get dog toothpaste|`|024lJBZ4aa	It really depends...if the dog has an infection in his mouth then that infection can travel to his heart.  Also, does you dog have pain in his mouth?<br>  <br>  I think you need to break down and spend the money.  Small dogs are notorious for having bad teeth.  Get the dogs teeth cleaned, have the vet take any teeth that need to come out and take care of any infection.  Once he comes back, make a daily habit of brushing your dogs teeth, so things don't get that bad again.  <br>  <br>  Ask the vet if he can work out a payment plan

137OkESPaa	Corn Snake, hands down and no contest.  Corns are the closest thing to a 'tame' snake going, most will readily accept pre-killed mice as feeders, which means you can mail order frozen if you want, size means they are less difficult to maintain, they are readily available in many color morphs, and in reality they are one of the best snakes for keepers at a variety of levels.  Great as a one snake pet and great for breeding, not to hard and offspring are easily sold off.  Another big Plus, far less likely to have legal issues with corns, and safety due to strangulation is a virtual non issue.  <br>  <br>  Just be sure to do your research first - and take the time to look at many different corns, there are some amazing ones available.|`|80vFuZrqaa	well my brother has a corn snake and its really nice, im not sure about the ball pythons but i know they can get kinda big but really it depends on what you like if you like the color red then get the corn snake but if you like something bigger then go for the ball python|`|jTeDpBjlaa	I would say corn snake, for 2 reasons.<br>  <br>  1. You don't have to keep such tight controls on the humidity, nor on the temperature (since they are found locally, in the states, anyway). Just keeping the room warm enough with a heating pad under 1 side of the cage is usually sufficient!<br>  <br>  2. Corn snakes aren't as finicky as ball pythons can be when feeding. In the wild, ball pythons normally eat birds. Some folks have problems getting a ball python to eat mice, even captive bred. I guess it's programmed in their genes. (Although I do have friends who've never had problems getting a ball python to eat a mouse).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|niztxto9aa	Bp's and corns are great as beginner snakes. But it really depends on what you personally are looking for. If you're looking for nice small to medium sized serpent that will be a pleasure to keep when older, go for the bp. If you're looking for a snake that will stay relatively small, go for the corn. As far as colors go, both corns and bp's have great designer morphs to choose from.|`|w8v7AhOBaa	Corn snake, by far, listen to Nora, she/he has a good point!|`|T4tM4NWKaa	corn snake
iasOicRjaa	Try to get them around them....they are wonderful :-)<br>  <br>  They may be concerned that they are so large but most people don't realize how docile and sweet they are. Just start talking about them a lot and see if they are open minded enough just to go to a meet and greet for greyhound adoptees....we have one here once a month a Books-A-Million....<br>  <br>  Another idea I just came up with...only if you KNOW you can really do it...see if they will agree to a TRIAL basis and foster 1 greyhound for a local rescue....then they will be exposed to them and maybe that will help them realize how awesome they are. *Maybe* they will consider one after that...who knows it may work and if it doesn't at least you will get to participate on some level...just remind them it is a good deed and it is temporary :-) Remember that is your time to shine and prove to them you can handle the responsibility so don't let them down. Good Luck !|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	You will need to show your responsible you say you help out a little then start helping out more. I would also be good for you do research on greyhounds if you have not already and share that information with your folks. For example inside greyhounds are pretty inactive (couch potatoes) You might also lists some of the benefits of having a dog people with dogs or any pet generally have less stress then those with out pets.  If your in a down mood your pet can quickly turn that around.<br>  <br>  Another thing you need to ask yourself is will you have the time to give a greyhound the proper exercise? they should get at least one brisk walk a day (or at least every other day) and it be good if you could find somewhere perhaps a dog park where they can just run around off leash for some time or even your yard if it is big enough.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Try and find a greyhound rescue to volunteer with.  Enjoy those dogs, and then when you get your own place, own job, then you can get your dream dog.  People wait YEARS before getting a dog they dream about.|`|118h96Q8aa	Actually, I don't think a greyhound is a good first dog for ANYONE let alone a kid. Greyhounds are a large breed dog that had loads of energy. They need tons of extra exercise everyday on tops of regular walks. They were bred for running. It's in their blood. Not to mention all the extra responsibilities that come alone with owning your own dog. For one thing, dogs need regular grooming. Obviously, a greyhound won't need a haircut, but occasional baths will be necessary. Also, they need weekly trips to the groomer to get their ears cleaned, nails trimmed, anal glands expressed, and other grooming needs. <br>  <br>  I think you should finish school first, then maybe when you have your own place you can see if a dog will fit into your lifestyle.|`|jjoBO3jkaa	I've always wanted one. If you are responsible and show that you are mature enough to handle having one, (they have a lot of energy!) Then yeah! And good choice. A lot of dog-racers get rid of them when they aren't as fast and they end up at the pound. beautiful, graceful loyal creatures though.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	Make a portfolio all about greyhounds and show them that you have a lot of knowledge about the breed and dogs in general. Convince them that you are responsible enough for a dog.|`|hBiSNoE7aa	You sound responsible, so that's a good start. Do you have a big backyard with a high fence? (greyhounds can jump high and are tall) Are you able to take the dog for walks and play with him/her? If you are too busy with school activities or clubs it would not be fair to the dog. If you can say yes to these two (or if you think your parents can make the fence taller and help with walking the dog), then you should also try volunteering at a local animal shelter to show your parents that you do care and that you can work with dogs. It will also give you good experience. There may even be a greyhound rescue group in your area that you could contact to meet some of their dogs or help them with a fundraiser event, just look on www.petfinder.com. When they see how much you care, they may get you your dog. But some parents just do not like having pets. They are a lot of responsibility, and it is very sad when they die. And if they break a leg or have a serious medical problem it can be very very expensive to fix, sometimes thousands of dollars!|`|gt7b439jaa	1. Get a good list of reasons why. And reasons like "because I really want to" are not gonna get you anywhere.<br>     2. Try to persuade them. For example, if you want to have a dog, things like "it'll teach me more responsibility" and "it'll let me get more exercise" etc. might help.<br>     3. Keep at it. That doesn't mean begging constantly, though. Ask them ocasionally, every few days or so. If they get mad at you, stop for a week or so. If you see your parents' answers go from NO to POSSIBLY to WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT to MAYBE (etc.) you can be sure you're making progress!<br>     4. Make deals with them. That's what I always do. Stuff like "if I clean my room and do the dishes everyday without being asked to for half a year, may I please get a cell phone?" but keep the deals fair.<br>     5. Negotiate. If you want a PlayStation2 game, say that you'll pay for it with your own allowance, or say that you could get a used game; those are cheaper.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Have a SLIGHTLY begging tone of voice. This works for me 50% of the time. Don't go "can I blahblahblah!?" in a forceful way. Go like "mom/dad, may I please blahblahblah...?" of course, it may not work for you. Every parent is different.<br>      * Do stuff. Help clean the living room. Do the dishes. Set the table. Feed the fish. Take care of your little brother. These are all chores that can help boost up the chance of you getting what you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  BUT------<br>      * Don't beg. I stated in the Tips "have a slightly begging tone of voice". That's quite different than begging. Begging is whining and wailing constantly about whatever you want. It'll get your parents MAD and that flushes down your chance of getting/doing your dream thing.<br>      * Not all parents are the same. This article may not help you much at all. Your parents might be real strict. Just look for ways to make their day and they might be nicer.<br>      * Money is almost always an issue. If you're from a less fortunate family, money is probably the pothole in the road. If your parents are cashiers at the Supermarket and you want a Nintendo Wii, there's not that big of a chance that you'll get one (unless your parents are real sweet or something). Try to put yourself in their shoes and you'll probably understand.|`|n4tzvlAmaa	promise to a lot more around the house to help,and promise and i mean PROMISE to take care of that dog... and treat it with the care and respect that it deserves|`|KuiuUtY5aa	you need to be very resposible, ya know. try to be responsible around them.|`|1baSSCDmaa	just make it sound like its going to teach you some mega responsibility and it will be very good for you...and just play that up a lot.|`|xDw0U9V6aa	u can tell them he wont make a mess or u can keep on begging 4 1 otherwise just save money and buy it|`|b3ZLY5osaa	lots of greyhounds need homes you should show them one of the websites with retired racing greyhounds
hIyjdXr9aa	The person you heard that from meant two watts per gallon of water, not two watts total.  Let me explain.  You divide the total number of watts shining on the tank by the number of gallons of water in the tank.  That's how they got the number two watts per gallon.  No, you cannot shine fifteen watts per gallon on the hornwort.  It would fry. <br>  <br>  You should provide ten hours of lighting a day so that the plant has time to start up and shut down its photosynthesis reactions.  Yes, hornwort can SURVIVE in two watts  of lighting per gallon for eight hours a day, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea.  I do not recommend such low lighting.  Try three watts per gallon for ten hours.  Your hornwort will flourish.  :D<br>  <br>  Hornwort is extremely fast growing in the right conditions.  If you've had your hornwort in your aquarium for more than six weeks and it has grown immensely, then it's possible that it has exhausted the nutrients in the tank.  An underwater plant fertilizer supplement would fix this.  But if you have fish in that aquarium and if the hornwort has only grown a little bit, then it has definitely not exhausted the nutrients available to it.  <br>  <br>  Hornwort is extremely susceptible to copper and dies if it is present in the water.   Algae controlling medication will also kill your hornwort.  These two things or low lighting could be what is causing your hornwort leaves to break off.  <br>  <br>  Try three watts per gallon.  :)
Jis9ipcNaa	I highly doubt you have a pregnant goldfish, they don't generally spawn in an aquarium, even if, they lay eggs, which you should be able to see.|`|oJoYk2Ataa	If they're new and they can fit in their mouth, then yes. You could separate them or move them out of the tank.|`|Ho00LuMvaa	if it is there baby definatly not if not there is a possibility i would keep the baby away if it is not theres.|`|WnDWrEiOaa	yeah they will eat all of them
oJoYk2Ataa	If you just bought your fish tank and put the fish in, then:<br>  1.Tap water has to be treated so the harmful chemicals can be removed.<br>  2.Tank has to be cycled to get some beneficial bacteria that converts harmful fish wastes to nitrate, which is less harmful.<br>  3.If you got some tropical fish, most of them need a heater.<br>  4.Aside from beneficial bacteria, a filter also helps clean the water...<br>  5.Did you get any free plants with your tank? Free stuff might be low quality and the plants may have some sharp areas that caused your fish to bleed.<br>  <br>  If you did get tropical fish, try getting goldfish first, they're easier to keep. As long as you have a tank and not a fish bowl with water changes every once in a while and maybe a box filte, they should be fine ^^|`|tMtBe1lKaa	You should say what kind of fish, and any syptoms it had before.

Watch her for a couple of days and if the symptoms continue then you might want to take her in to see the vet.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	I doubt that the cat caught anything from the puppy,but it would be a good idea to take him to the vet as well to see what the problem is.|`|oHTtPNv9aa	Your kitty may have gotten into something that upset its stomach.

They have been with me for 13 years and the same exact thing happens whenever I take one to the vet and when we get home the others hiss and act strangely also.  I think it is because of the smells of a few possible things.  They either do not like the smell of other strange cats, they hate going to the vet and if one went, maybe they assume they will be next, or the smell of the shampoo or whatever they cleaned him off with they are not used to and don't like anything different.  Cats are very picky about their environment and everything they smell so any different smells makes them uncomfortable and probably a bit irritated and afraid of what may happen to them next.  This is just from my experience.  But I don't think it will last more than a day, at least it doesn't at my place.  Don't worry it is pretty normal behaviour.  God Bless and peace.
AA11901352	If you have males NO FEMALE mollies will change sex and become female, they are male or female they don't change.  If your fish is Plump in the belly and you know it is a male, it could have bloat or the start of dropsy.<br>  <br>  Your male isn't pregnant unless it is a female.  Stop feeding your fish flaked or pellet foods and either let them eat the algae only or feed them green veggies only for the next few days.  If you see your male blowing up like a balloon and scales sticking out it is dropsy.<br>  <br>  Weekly water changes of 25% are needed to keep the water quality high.<br>  <br>  Are you sure you have two males?|`|gg9LMFd7aa	ah|`|1YNhKzeqaa	I have heard that mollies can change gender too... I've never owned mollies, but I have been raising guppies and swordtails for about 6 years now, and they are live bearers too.<br>  <br>  Pregnant fish tend to stay close to the heater and eat less. A tell-tale sign would be the gravid spot, but since your molly is black you won't be able to see it.<br>  <br>  What you should do is provide hiding places in the tank for her to give birth in. You don't want her to get stressed out by other tank mates while she is giving birth. They tend to like hiding spots closer to the heater.<br>  <br>  Provide plant cover for the fry so they don't get eaten. I use live plants in my tank, my current set up includes micro sword for the fry. <br>  <br>  In my very first tank, I used water sprite, it is hardy, grows very well, and provides plenty of cover. I didn't even need fertilizer or CO2, I would actually advise against fertilizer and CO2 for water sprite, as it will very rapidly take over your tank if you do add it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some people prefer to put the mother in a separate tank for giving birth, I don't like to, as this can put extra stress on her, and puts extra stress on your wallet.<br>  <br>  Another option is a breeders box clipped on to the top inside of the main tank. This keeps the fry safe from adults.<br>  <br>  For the previous two options be sure to remove the mother from the breeding tank or box after she gives birth, or she might just help herself to a little post-labor snack. Yep, even mommy dearest will eat her children. (Talk about tough love!)<br>  Before she gives birth, her belly will seem a bit squarish, this will help you be able to tell when she's about to give birth.<br>  <br>  Good luck :D

QI5RoBXnaa	Shock collars are not illegal, would pet supply store sell them if they were? Anyways, I debated about getting one and decided to give it a try.  When I left for work my dog would bark for hours.  Her separation anxiety was severe.  I used it on her and she stopped barking after the first shock.  When she stopped barking she was not able to work herself into a frenzy and her days went a lot smoother.  I now come home to a happier dog.  It has been several months since I have even used the collar on her but it was a great investment for the happiness in my household.  The dogs as well as mine.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	shock collars are not cruel. It's not like they constantly zap the dog. We have one and it worked great. It has 6 intensity levels and starts out on the easiest one. If the dog doesn't stop barking it keeps going higher in intensity. Our dog always stopped at the first zap and very rarely needed the second one. She had training and everything. She is the best dog in the world but her barking was crazy, especially when strangers came to the house or other dogs. The collar changed her completely. They sell shock collars at department stores and pet stores of course. Some dog trainers even recommend them. <br>  Godd luck and believe me, it works!!!|`|jItNwbpQaa	No. Shock collars hurt dogs, and only cruel people use them.

Hopefully he's food motivated.  Take him outside and watch him to see what he is barking at, when he begins to bark, call his and a command such as 'zip it'. If he stops barking, say good 'zip it' and provide him a treat. This will take awhile to work and it will be frustrating - but keep it up and he'll learn.|`|rhoNcYE8aa	I have not used bark collars, but all 8 of my dogs are on my underground fence, which uses shock collars.

Keep a variety in the diet as it's best for nutrients. Wax worms and meal worms may also be fed along with crickets. Once it gets a little larger you may offer it pinkie mice (not often as they are high in fat), larger crickets, larger meal worms, super worms, etc. <br>  <br>  The condition of the pacman's body is an indicator if it needs to eat more or eat less.

Unless these are very small or unhealthy dogs who ate a LOT of the SJ mix, they will be fine.<br>  <br>  Onion toxicity causes ruptures in red blood cells, which can result in anemia. This toxicity will peak four to six days after consumption.

She is a cat, an animal. She doesn't know what "fire" is.<br>  <br>  Yes her whiskers will grow back. Cats shed their whiskers, and they grow back. Your cat does use her whiskers to see if a space is too small to fit in, and other things too.<br>  <br>  Cats are actually very smart, they can trick you into things (seriously), they know a lot more tricks than dogs (different and same tricks) that they learned on their own, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  They may know what fire is or that it exists, but they don't know it can hurt them.<br>  <br>  Oh, I know you weren't trying to say your cat was stupid, I just took the opportunity to tell you how smart they are! :) I know you love her.<br>  <br>  Lol, yup!

I remember cutting the whiskers off my cat when I was young. I got my butt tanned for that!<br>  <br>  Actually, cats do know what fire is. House-cats tend to be ignorant though, because they are never exposed to large fires.<br>  <br>  One of my cats had some of her fur burned off (only fur, there was no serious skin damage) when a heat lamp fell and started a small fire in the dog house they use during the winter. Now if I even light a lighter near the cat she hisses/growls and runs away from me.<br>  <br>  My other cats are unaffected and have nearly burned there own whiskers off trying to sniff the flame.|`|AA11736483	Whiskers will grow back eventually, but it takes some time. The cat isn't crazy, it's more likely that the people she is living with don't understand animals. There are certain things in the house that can be dangerous to cats. Candles is one of the worst. Not only can a cats fur catch fire, but most of the popular candles sold today are of scented variety. Many of these scents are potentially harmful to cats (and probably humans as well).|`|Rw7gi86Naa	The cat is not dumb. You are dumb for letting her run around burning candles unsupervised.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also known as "tactile hairs" or vibrissae, whiskers are the long, thick, flexible hairs on a cat's face.  These hairs are located in horizontal rows on the whisker pad, the puffy area between the top corners of your cat's mouth and the outer edges of his nose.  Whiskers, like hair and nails, do fall out and are replaced.  <br>  <br>  In addition to having the long tactile hairs on their cheeks, cats also have shorter ones above their eyebrows, on their chin and on the back of their front legs.  Whiskers are necessary and useful for navigation, mood indication and measuring an opening, (to name a few).<br>  <br>  - Whiskers are rooted very deep in the cat's face, in an area rich in nerves and blood vessels.  So you should never EVER trim or try to clean your cat’s whiskers - It will hinder one of your cat's 'sensing' abilities.  <br>  - If a whisker falls out, don't worry another will grow in its place.  <br>  <br>  Whiskers help the cat feel his way around.  Whiskers are so sensitive that they can detect the slightest directional change in a breeze.  At night, for example, this helps a cat slink its way through a room and not bump into anything.  How?  The air currents in the room change depending on where pieces of furniture are located.  As the cat walks through the room and approaches the couch, he'll know which direction to turn based on the change in air current around the couch.  <br>  In addition to having sensory properties, a cat's whiskers are also a good indicator of his mood.  When a cat is angry or feels defensive, the whiskers will be pulled back.  Otherwise, when the cat is happy, curious or content, the whiskers will be more relaxed and pushed forward.  <br>  <br>  But the whisker's primary use is to help a cat judge whether or not he'll fit through an opening.  A cat's whiskers are roughly as wide as his body -- sort of a natural ruler.  The whisker tips are sensitive to pressure.  You'll probably see a cat stick his head in and out of an opening before he puts his body in.  He's judging the width of the opening, and is determining if he can fit into it.  An interesting note: cats don't have a true collar bone, like humans.  This allows them to turn and twist their way through very narrow openings.
oQmL4IdWaa	Did she use to change in behind or is she just learning lead changes?<br>  <br>  Probably the best thing to do would be have a good vet do a lameness exam on her.  Find a vet that specializes in sports medicine and lameness, because your average every day farm vet often doesn't have enough experience to detect minor lameness.<br>  <br>  If she comes up clean, you could try having a chiropractor adjust her, but most likely the problem is she is either not athletic enough, or strong enough, or trained well enough to do lead changes under saddle yet.  Find a good instructor/coach/trainer to help you.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	have you had her vet checked?<br>  she possibly has a bad back or sore legs.<br>  at least that's what it sounds like to me.|`|H3ktCe3Eaa	My pony is always doing that too.<br>  Usually what I do, is if he doesn't get the back lead, I make him stop and then pick up the canter in a simple change, then go back into a trot, and then I get him super collected (but energetic and going good) and ask again.

cSOwqXKxaa	Well, her eyes, tail and leg structure seem to resemble a greyhound a little, so perhaps there is no lab at all, and she's pointer and greyhound.

They need plenty of vigorous exercise every day. All this could be from pent up energy and boredom. You can also try crate training them when you aren't there. It takes a while to do this so be patient. Get a wire crate and hold a treat in the back through the bars (so the treat will be inside the cage) wait for them to go inside and let them have the treat. Give them lots of praise. Do this a few times a day. DO NOT shut the door, this may cause anxiety if done too early and make them afraid of the crates. Once they are comfortable inside the crates gradually increase the amount of time they are in there. As for the growling, if he isn't neutered I would do so immediately. This can help curb aggression by getting rid of testosterone. Other than that, talk to a vet or trainer. There may be other issues at hand.

f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	You might need to do a bit of detective work.<br>  <br>  Do the bites have a tiny little red centre to them?   If so then they are probably flea bites.<br>  <br>  If your cats are using any sort of flea protection, it is possible that a flea was brought in by one of the cats, and jumped off and laid eggs before it was killed by the preparation.<br>  <br>  Certain types of fleas seem to prefer human blood to cat blood.  These are usually rat or mice fleas and not cat fleas.<br>  <br>  A rat or mice flea will jump on a cat but then abandon it for humans if they get the chance.<br>  <br>  But the fact that you wake up with the itchy bites also makes me think of bed bugs.   With flea bites you are likely to get them on your legs during the day as well. <br>  <br>  You will rarely find bed bugs in your bed, they are very crafty and only come out from their hiding places in the middle of the night and disappear back to their hiding places before morning. There are usually blood spots on the bed linen if it is bed bugs.<br>  <br>  They live in holes in skirting boards or behind wallpaper, or under the bedframe.<br>  <br>  These are bed bug bites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&hl=en&q=bed+bug+bites&gbv=2&aq=0&oq=bed+bug+bite" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.co.uk/images?client...</a><br>  <br>  And these are flea bites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?gbv=2&hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&q=flea+bites&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.co.uk/images?gbv=2&...</a><br>  <br>  You might need to do a fumigate of your house for best results.  Flea bombs work very well and do the whole house in one go.<br>  <br>  If it is bed bugs then you would need professional help.|`|rr2tWnuqaa	You now need to try your skills as a detective. There are some resemblances of flea bites and bed bug bites. Depending on where you live there could also be fire ant bites. But if your waking up with these bites, then do some checking. Pull the covers back get a good flash light and check things out by looking in the cracks and crevices of the mattress for bedbugs. Do any of your pets sleep with you? that could be where the problem is coming from. <br>  check the reference box below for more details.
VY2T6hrbaa	I bought a horse that was being fed textured sweet feed.  I switched him to grain as quickly as possible.  The sweet feed made him hyper because it had so much molasses in it!  My vet recommended I switch to 12% grain so I did and I saw a HUGE difference..much calmer.<br>  <br>  PLEASE note that it took days to switch the feed.  You have to mix it in and gradually shift the ratio from old to new.  It can make the horse colic if you switch feed or even hay quickly.<br>  <br>  My friend feeds her horses sweet feed mixed in with the grain in the winter for extra calories.  Mine are easy keepers so I don't need to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
H06PtiIAaa	not sure of the problem, outside of cloudy water?<br>  <br>  is there sand on your rock and corals? by adding more currents like a power head or hydor which is my favorite, this will add currents to help keep stuff off of your corals.<br>  <br>  For clearness, it depends on water parameters. try cleaning the glass and doing a water change, it shouldnt be cloudy.<br>  <br>  For the filter, i would get a HOB the more filtration the better. i personally like aquaclears as you can customize the media, which for saltwater you want to have some sort of phosophate remover.|`|AA11901352	Simply get a wooden spoon that has been cleaned and swish off the sand lightly.  You don't need to change the filter bags what so ever and actually you should not be running any carbon on this tank.<br>  <br>  Check your outflow on the filter and be sure it isn't too high.  Sand is going to get in places in the tank that you may not want.  This is just the way it is.  You didn't say you had a power head of any kind.  Usually you can just point it to where the sand is and blow it off.<br>  <br>  Once your tank has been running and the sand has settled down this should not keep happening.<br>  <br>  Also it really isn't a worry if the rock has sand on it.For your 30 gallon what you have as far as a filter is fine you really don't need another one.  I cannot see a bacterial bloom happening just because of one fish.  It could have been from the filter change though.  How much sand do you have in the bottom of the tank?  You should only have 2" or less.  Sometimes too much sand will work itsway around the tank not to mention can form gas pocket in the tank.

It costs a lot more from a breeder.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Yes, of course they do.  Adoption fees help cover a SMALL portion of the expenses the shelter incurs for each cat. When you pay an adoption fee of around $100 you're getting a cat that is already spayed or neutered and also probably deflead/dewormed, up to date on shots, tested for disease and microchipped.  All of this costs the shelter about $400.<br>  <br>  Not-for-profit just means that they're not in the business to make a money and then distribute that money to the shareholders or owners of the business - like most corporations, sole proprietorships, LLC's.  All money that goes into the business is used by the business to run it.  This doesn't mean they have a huge bank account because most not-for-profits are quite costly to run.  Not-for-profit shelters survive by donations from individuals and corporations, fundraising events during the year and by having a lot of the services and supplies they would have to pay for instead donated.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford an adoption fee from a shelter then you can't afford a pet.  The $100 or so that you'll pay for a pet from a shelter is very minimal compared to the monthly cost of supplies all year long and vet bills.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Yes they will have fees even nonprofit shelters have costs. And the fees you pay help cover those costs. Without the fees there would be no shelter.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Usually they do.  The definition of a non-profit organization is that any money they make, they put back into the company.  "the nonprofit corporation exists solely to provide programs and services that are of public benefit".   In the case of a shelter, the money they make goes into caring for the cats and rescuing more cats, and paying employees if they have any paid employees.  It can also go into buying supplies, renovating the building, stuff like that.  Nonprofit does not mean that they don't charge money.  They need that adoption fee to be able to afford to operate.  They usually exist on donations as well.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Most shelters do require an adoption fee because:<br>  1)  Shelters don't recieve any money from the government.  They rely on donations from the public and from private sponsors as their only means of support.  The donations are used for building upkeep, staffing, food for the animals, electricity, etc.<br>  <br>  2)  Shelters know that people place more value on animals if they pay for them. Animals people get for free are less likely to receive vet care and be spayed/neutered.  Free animals are often thought of as disposable and often end up either being dumped or turned in to a shelter.  By charging a fee, the shelter weeds out *impulse buyers* and places a value on the pet which makes it more likely to go to a good forever home.<br>  <br>  3)  Most pets you get from a shelter will have shots, be dewormed, spayed/neutered, and deflead.  It costs the shelter money to have vets perform these services so they must charge a fee to defray their costs.<br>  <br>  Non-profit means they don't make any  overhead money from selling the animals.  All proceeds from adoption fees goes back into the running of the shelter and care of the animals there.|`|dD2j2j71aa	Sometimes they ask for a donation|`|ZB524v05aa	yes, nonprofit just means that the company is not open to make a profit.

This shows the first signs of maturity. If they are in a fun and clean environment they should grow up happily and healthy. If both parents are used to having you around it should be easier to get the babies to love you. Just don't separate them from their parents until at least a couple months. Hope this helped=]|`|HGOUI26qaa	Age is not a factor, it is how much you work with your bird in order for him/her to trust you.  Begin by finding a favorite food for your bird such as a fruit or veggie.  When you find you what they like, you can start by holding this treat through the bars and eventually, they will come eat from your hand.  At that time you can begin putting your hand in the cage and offer the treat.  If the bird accepts you, do this for about a week.  The next step would be to put your hand in the cage and put your finger into the area just bellow the feet and press on his feathers very lightly.  This will encourage the bird to step up on your finger.  Remember, Parakeets can bight so be prepared for that.  If you want to get your parakeet to sit on your finger outside of the cage, you must think about getting the birds wings clipped so it wont fly into windows etc..  Pick up a book on parakeets and it will go further into training a bird.<br>  Matt<br>  www.midsouthcanaries.com<br>  www.staffordcanaries.com

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	To kill cat pee smells for good, thoroughly soak the urine spot with a combination of plain white vinegar and club soda water. If you don't have soda water, that's OK, the vinegar will work fine on it's own. If the spot is on a carpet, cover the vinegar with layers of newspapers or paper towels, and place something heavy on top of the papers, such as a stack of books. Be sure to protect your books from the moisture with a plastic bag. Leave everything on there and let the vinegar dry on the spot. The acid pH of the vinegar will counterbalance the alkaline pH of the urine, thus killing the smell for good, and it should prevent a kitty from peeing there again. Vinegar stinks a bit, but it's not as bad as cat pee smell! This really works good, I have used this trick for years. They also sell special cleaners for this in pet stores, the most common one is called Nature's Miracle. I have never tried it because the vinegar trick works great, and you can find a gallon of vinegar for not much money at all. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps =^.^=|`|FLXQ56DMaa	make a paste out of baking soda and water and put on ..let it dry vaccume it up should take the smell right out.|`|SjGpbohiaa	Get rid of the cat and buy a new couch.|`|bBGBFOWhaa	can you not strip down the couch cushions and socke them up 4 a night or 2 so it can get the smell out.|`|4WFN0awMaa	If you can afford it, have someone who cleans carpets and rugs come and clean it with their pro. machines...I had them clean mine (have 4 kids) and after they looked like new because all the stains came out just fine.

930525fae9ce50d25e62f663d2250380aa	This is how I did my teaching of name.<br>  Every time the dog was involved I would use its name.  Such as:<br>  Bailey, lets go for a walk.  Does Bailey want to go for a walk?  Yes, lets go Bailey!  or the same for his two meals a day....   Bailey, breakfast?  Yes Bailey wants breakfast, okay lets go to the kitchen! Sit Bailey, wait Bailey, good boy Bailey!  okay, you can eat Bailey.<br>  <br>  By this time in three days, Bailey knows he is Bailey.  Other people have names as well, and I can say, "go check Max in the kitchen!  He might give Bailey a treat!"  Bailey definitely knows that Max - kitchen - treat- is an equation where the answer is = something for him.<br>  Good Luck|`|X7i59NeIaa	Every time he would come we would give him a little treat and praise him and give him hugs and pet him.

I usually would say his name in an enthusiastic voice and I would look directly at him.<br>  Hope this helped!|`|fTQmn5V3aa	First step: Choose a quiet time and place, just you and your puppy. Have a handful of very small treats. Find a sound that attracts your puppy's attention - maybe a click with your tongue, or a low whistle. Make this sound and IMMEDIATELY follow it with your puppy's name. As soon as he pays attention to you, give him a tiny treat and a stroke or two. Move away from him a bit, and repeat. Move away again, repeat. Puppies don't have a long attention span, so don't push it beyond five or six repetitions. Wait a couple of hours, and then do another session. Four or five sessions a day for four or five days should work. On the fourth or fifth day, occasionally drop the initial sound and just say his name. He should start to respond to just his name in short order. He will be associating his name with treats.<br>  Second step: get a friend or family member to work with you, following the method above. It won't be long before he's trotting to anyone calling his name!
VtHvcEtuaa	It's possible, but you would be considered a BYB, irresponsible, and would also be adding to the number of dogs in shelters|`|76nTvO4iaa	Yes you can, but WHY would you want to?|`|PM23RDycaa	They will still be mutts. 3/4 Pom mutts but mutts non the less.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	It is possible, but  why would you  want to when thousands of mutts are stuck in pounds, most likely will be euthanised for the Simple reason, I have No home. Do you want to add to the large number of homeless dogs?<br>  <br>  Most people are surprised to learn that we have a very large pet overpopulation problem here in the United States. There are so many animals born DAILY that it boggles the mind! This is a nightmare problem that doesn’t ever seem to get better. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that there are over 70,000 puppies and kittens born every twenty-four hours. That is a whole lot of babies! To even attempt to place those numbers of animals is impossible. There are about seven animals to every human born. The sad fact is that just is not possible to place them all. <br>  <br>  Every year over 20 million animals end up in a shelter. Over 15 million of them are killed (euthanized is the nice term). Of those animals 61% of the dogs and 75% of the cats are killed. Very few of these are claimed and there are many more that die from disease, starvation, animal attacks and cars! Anyone who sees these facts must agree that not neutering an animal is contributing to mass cruelty and irresponsibility! <br>  <br>  Many people feel that neutering an animal is cruel, it isn’t. The fact is that it is actually much healthier and more beneficial to your animal. The terms related to this procedure "fixed" and "spayed" for the females ( Terms: "*****" for dogs or "Queen" for cats ) or "altered" for the male (Terms: "Dog" for canines or "Tom" for cats) are pretty negative but the procedure is a very loving and positive thing to do for your pet. <br>  <br>  Benefits to your pet after neutering mean that females have less chance of ovarian cancer or uterine infections if it is done before their first "heat". Each cycle they experience increases the chances of illness greatly, as much as ten times each! The other benefit is that you will not have to clean up the mess which happens during her cycle! The behavior benefits mean that your pooch or feline will be calmer and more reliable. You also won’t have to bat the male dogs or cats away and deal with the fence climbing, dirt digging, fence destroying mongrels or yowling, prowling, spraying and fighting tom cats! <br>  <br>  Neutering your pet is just as important! It takes only one escape to find a female and become a villain of pet overpopulation. One cat and her kits will produce over 420,000 cats in about seven years! Males who are neutered have less of a desire to roam, fight, mark and be destructive. They also have less problems with the prostate gland and testicular cancer. From a behavioral standpoint, neutered animals are more reliable, stable and have about sixty percent (60%) less problems than those left "intact." <br>  <br>  Veterinarians are now able to neuter animals at younger ages, some as early as two to four months of age! Traditionally, most veterinary offices will perform this procedure at six months. It is cheaper and easier to neuter the younger animals as many clinics will charge by weight.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	No, Purebreds must be bred with other purebreds of the same breed..

They shouldn't feel anything but it might be a little sore just like the what the surgery would cause but nothing too extreme.

Most likely it was some small terrier mix, with a fancy name to make it sound like a Purebred. <br>  <br>  <br>  We cannot identify the breed without a picture<br>  <br>  AKC reconised dog breeds<br>  Otterhound, Old English Sheepdog<br>  <br>  Unreconised by AKC<br>  Old Danish Chicken dog<br>  Old English Mastiff<br>  Old time farm Shepherd<br>  Olde Boston Bulldogge <br>  Olde English Bulldogge <br>  Olde Victorian Bulldogge <br>  Original English Bulldogge<br>  Original Mountain Cur<br>  Otto Bulldog<br>  Owczarek Podhalanski (photo needed)<br>  <br>  Before you get a dog<br>  Because BreedX is 'Cool', was in a movie you saw, is unique and exotic, is free/cheap, or other such nonsense .  .  . One of the WORSE reasons to get a dog, or any other animal, for that matter, is because of their physical appearance or popularity due to a movie, TV show, or other publicity.  Often, these venues feature exotic, rare or unique breeds that are, in the overwhelming majority of pet situations, unsuitable as companions.  This visibility may also draw out those 'breeders' whose primary motivation is profit versus health, temperament, structural soundness and the welfare of their dogs.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  And, remember to incorporate the same thoughtful consideration on whether or not to get a dog, and which breed or mix, when your friend, coworker or relative offers you one of Fluffy's puppies.  Dogs are never really 'free' or 'cheap' and, in reality, require significant financial, physical, time, and environmental resources.  At a minimum, none of these, or other such reasons, are sound selection factors for getting a dog and selecting a particular breed or mix.  And, remember, if it is difficult for you to find information on a particular breed, or a breeder of the breed, it follows that you will most likely also have difficulty finding local support services that are familiar with the training, health care, and maintenance needs of that breed.<br>  <br>  Havanese<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/havanese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/havanese.htm</a><br>  <br>  Maltese<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/maltese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/maltese.htm</a><br>  <br>  Shih Tzu<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shihtzu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shihtzu.htm</a>|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	There isn't a breed out there that I'm familiar with that starts with an "O" that won't get larger than 12 pounds.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you're mistaken on the the letter?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.i-love-dogs.com/dog-breeds/" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-love-dogs.com/dog-breeds/</a>|`|qquBTV4Naa	It is not important to get a specific breed.

GR2XNzCCaa	I have no clue. Maybe new born puppies are cuter? In my opinion, that's pretty dumb. <br>  Aside from my two beta fish (not bought at the same time of course), I've only rescued my pets. 1st cat - adopted from a local, no kill shelter. 2nd and 3rd cat - (only one still alive) Were stray cats found in car engines after storms. My dog - Left behind when owners moved away (had one broken leg from old owner's pit bull fights) Both turtles - noticed them in my driveway right before backing over them. Had them for about 3 years each.<br>  <br>  So as you can see, I can't turn away any animal with a sob story... So I also can't understand buying thousand dollar dogs when cute little animals in are just as easy (or easier) to help out.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I have also gotten all my dogs from shelters prior to my most recent pet.  The reason I chose to purchase from a reputable breeder this time around is because I wanted an exact breed.  I wanted genetic testing and I wanted to have a really good chance at getting exactly what I wanted in terms of temperament and things of that nature.  With shelter mutts, its all up in the air.  You aren't ever 100% sure what the dog is mixed with and you have no sense of its medical history.  Not to mention there's no way to know anything about its temperament nor possibly what had happened earlier in its life that may affect his/her behavior.  I just like knowing exactly where my dog came from and knowing all about her parents' history and bloodline.  Its just my personal preference.  I find absolutely nothing wrong with reputable, responsible breeding.  I understand that not everyone agrees with it, but this is the first dog that was going to be around my children and I was not willing to leave everything up to chance this time.  Its just what was best for our family.|`|Ry5sFO7iaa	because most poeple don't give a crap yeah i rescued my pit-bull he was a stray. he was in a alley i got him took him home mom and dad liked him he wasn't mean either. took him to the vet got him shots and pulled off like hundreds of ticks.|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	The same reason people buy new cars.<br>  <br>  Who wants damaged goods?|`|yLiOgVEYaa	i bought mine. from the shelter. whats the difference? they needed homes and i paid for them. i also donate to the ASPCA every month. almost everyone pays for their pet unless it was found on the street or given to them by someone of course. so what it is you are trying to say/ask?<br>  <br>  now, if you wonder why people buy from breeders.....it's because some people just have a personal preference on what kind of pet they want. which i am going to do as well one day.<br>  <br>  it's unfortunate the pet population is out of control and there are more animals than there are homes for them. sad but true. if i could save them all, i would. just not possible. that's why everyone should have their pet spayed/neutered.|`|lISrOzyraa	some people like to buy their pets as puppies or what have you. other like me like t rescue too.

For example, there may be bird rescues all over the US, but here in Australia there is only one official one on the other side of the country and they never have the specific species that would suit me. This is because many birds here are very, very expensive (eg, US Hyacinth macaws are so cheap at $10,000 compared to $70,000 here) which prevents impulse buying.<br>  Bloodline and genetics may also be important to a person for various reasons.<br>  <br>  Many people buy from pet shops, etc because they are misinformed, ignorant, or simply don't care. This is unfortunate. Anyone who wants a pet should THOROUGHLY research their choice before getting one. Someone who does their research would realise that a dog from a pet shop is not a good idea and that you can get the loveliest dogs around from the pound.|`|K7XSAjOvaa	People want specific animals and the ones they buy also need homes.No matter which way you look at it all animals need homes.Regardless if they are bought or adopted they all need a home.If no one bought the other animals they would not have a home because the owners won't keep the whole litter.I do agree that more animals need to be adopted than bred If more owners would neuter their pets we wouldn't have such a high number of pets being abandoned.|`|kMesQjEDaa	Good for you I also rescued my pets, some  pets that have to be rescued need special attention like some have their hair in knots and stuck to their skin like mine did and it took a long time to get them out like days or months and she was infested with fleas and ticks and was malnourished so it is a lot of work so some people just don't have the time or money to put up with a needy pet .|`|T8W2EZiwaa	I'm not sure what the correct ethical answer is, I'll leave that to you.

Not saying they shouldn't look at animal shelters, but that's they way it is.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	I am also one who takes in rescues but I don't typically get them from rescue services. God tends to drop them in my lap when they need a home and when I am ready to give a home. Not all people are able to deal with an animals past. If we like it or not, the rescue animals come with history and often times emotional quirks that need to be worked out. Not everyone has the patience for this type of work. An unqualified person taking in a rescue animal is more likely to drop it off at the pound when they can't fix certain issues that the animal has. If this is the case, it would be better for them to get a puppy so they can train the dog any way they want and it will most likely be easier for them to do.<br>  <br>     I would like more people to adopt rescue animals but if a person is not prepared to take the time to work out their issues, it is much better for the animal not to be shoved into yet another home. The people that take rescues need to make a commitment for life and many people just aren't able to do that for an adult animal. It is easier for them to bond to a cute little puppy than an adult dog.<br>  <br>  EDIT: to the person who says that they buy pets because they want a certain type of pet... Hogwash! I have two purebred dogs that are rescue. One Lhasa Apso and one Chihuahua. You can get any type of rescue animal you want if you are willing to look around.

SnAsZapMaa	No country has "shepards" - there's no task called ARDing, so no breed to perform it.<br>  Learn that there are HERDing breeds (and people!) called shepherds.<br>  <br>  So far as height is concerned, all varieties of the Belgian Shepherd are identical, and with one exception are also identical to the German Shepherd Dog. Here are the International Standards for all the sheep dogs: <a href="http://www.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.asp?lang=en&file=group1" rel="nofollow">http://www.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.a...</a> To get the English translation of a breed's Standard, scroll to that breed (look first for its homeland and then it's homeland-language's name for it; the English name follows that) then click the EN that's to the right.<br>  The exception is that a Belgian bit.ch is allowed to be 1cm taller than a GSD bit.ch is, but their minimum heights are identical. The size of the dogs is exactly the same for both breeds.<br>  Ignoring that 1cm extra for Belgian bitches:<br>  ? bitches should be 55-60cm tall at the shoulder vertically above the elbow,<br>  ? & dogs should be 60-65cm tall.<br>  A second class GSD may be 1cm smaller or taller than that, allowing a female to be 54-61cm, a male to be 59-66cm.<br>  <br>  54cm = 21? inches<br>  61cm = 24 inches.<br>  <br>  59cm = 23? inches<br>  66cm = 26 inches.<br>  <br>  As both breeds were developed to perform almost identical tasks in almost identical landscapes, with little more than the River Maas between them, their attitudinal & physical similarities far outweigh their slight differences. Well, until the show-is-all people and the ignorant-BYB-pet people got their hands on them, that is..... The most obvious of their differences are their coats - especially if you go back to photos of their foundation stock.<br>  <br>  One interesting genetic difference is that self-black GSDs are black because of the recessive a^ a^ pairing, as are the self-black Malinois, but the Groenendahls usually have the dominant K^B allele making them self-black.<br>  Les P<br>  owner of GSD_Friendly:  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_Friendly">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...</a><br>  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|P8Q39vA4aa	You mean the belgian shepherd which is the groendael in other countries. they are about the size of  german shepherds but have less bone density.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Lol whoever told you that is way off /(meant inches)<br>  <br>  Yes, just about the same size
c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	The answers above that say No are incorrect. If her pregnancy is still early and not too far along, a vet can spay the cat and terminate her pregnancy at the same time. If the kittens are getting too big and farther along in their development, then she will probably have to wait till after her kittens are weaned to get fixed.|`|AA10327148	Thank you for helping these cats in need.<br>  Your answer depends on some of these answers:<br>  #How "far along" is the queen's pregnancy? Although early and mid-term spay and abortion of pregnant cats is common, late-term abortion is generally not done.<br>  # How old is the cat?   <br>  # What is the cat's general physical condition? Is she in an overall good condition?<br>  <br>  You or your mom should speak to a vet, as soon as you can, and you can decide together.|`|s3A92M2Uaa	Yes. Most Vets will do the procedure. It is like doing an abortion and they are very professional about it. Just let them know before you schedule her spay that she may be carrying a litter. If you are unsure how far along she is it probably won't be a problem. Good luck & I feel that it is good that you are trying to help with population control in feral cats. Good Luck!|`|2XT1Klmraa	Yes, A vet can do an abortion and a spay at the same time. I think they are a little expensive. The best way to go is to bring th cat in, let her have the kittens, ween them, and get her spayed then. Then, just put her outside again. Find homesfor all the kittens, and Bam! Happyness! haha|`|fSxvrerTaa	It depends....in some cases I think a vet will...like if they kittens arent too far along. For instance my sweet girl got spaded even though she was pregnant.

Your vet can do a kitty abortion, and spay the cat at the same time. Of course it is best to spay the cat before it ever gets pregnant. The abortion/spay is more extensive surgery and more expensive, and more dangerous.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Yes a female cat can be spayed while pregnant, but it all depends on the vet what factors are taken into consideration.

Good luck.|`|W3KqA9t1aa	Vet's will spay and abort in one operation. They are not bound by the abortion laws for humans.

Chicken tractors are lightweight- a predator could lift it up. With the seperate coop, you can atleast lock them up safe at night.

1omgPICKaa	1. I don't reccomend it. Budgies are very aggressive birds and often adding a female when you have more males causes feathers to go flying. There is a good possibility that someone will end up injured or worse. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, it is possible for all three to get along peacefully, it depends on their personalities, how they get along, cage size, and how you introduce the female. Adding two or more females may be a better idea.<br>  <br>  If you are intent on doing this, feel free to message me for any advice.<br>  <br>  2. Up to 10 or more years. Some even reach 15. The oldest known was close to 30. However, most only live for 2-5 years. This is often due to a more diet of nothing but seed.<br>  <br>  3. Certainly budgies should be allowed out of their cage frequently. It depends on what species of plant it is. Here's a list of safe and toxic plants for birds: <a href="http://www.plannedparrothood.com/plants.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparrothood.com/plants....</a><br>  <br>  I hope that helps. :)|`|lnf4c1tFaa	the 2 males will probably fight for the female<br>  i think budgies live up to 15 years<br>  check on google what plants are safe|`|7MzldDHYaa	1)That would not be safe.They would battle for the female.You should get another cage and one more female.<br>  <br>  2)Budgies live to 15-25 years with proper care.<br>  <br>  3)Well...It depends on the plant... go to BudgiePlace.com and it will tell you all the toxic plants to budgies.(There are MANY toxic plants to parakeets.)
hnvrBAXgaa	Pros:<br>  Awesome, docile, fun animals to have. They are also really fun to watch eating.<br>  Cons:<br>  There aren't really any except the supplies can get expensive unless you are determined to get one.|`|sxX3mGP0aa	Only babies shed like crazy; adults just do it occasionally. As for biting, that really depends on the dragon and the keeper. I've never had a problem with it.<br>  <br>  The cons are basically practical--can get expensive, require a fair amount of room. But they are sweet and cuddly and live quite long if taken care of properly.|`|Ljqvfibfaa	A...bearded dragon... My guess is you are speaking hypothetically. And in that case it really depends. Obviously a dragon is naturally a wild animal and a dangerous creature; not an idol pet to keep in the first place. But if you are still crazy enough from that point to keep a dragon, a beard should not cause much of an issue. Though you will probably be the person to groom its' beard.|`|2NUKtY7Naa	pros: cool?  nothing really actually, fun to play with i guess, eat flies<br>  cons: shed like crazy, bite at first, cleaning up cages and the normal food and water thing|`|G12K7E0Yaa	please Research, if you dont know this answer, your not ready, not being mean just honest, they are wonderful pets and you will love it, just make sure your ready....|`|wfWAlztVaa	they're really cool<br>  but my friend had one, after saving up for months<br>  and it died the next week<br>  <br>  you have to be VERY careful with them, feed them EXACTLY what they need (size of crickets, type of crickets, time of day, whatever)<br>  because otherwise, they will die pretty easily<br>  <br>  but on the bright side, they're super cool to have<br>  and you totally get bragging rights|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	They are on the expensive side to keep but well worth it. You do have to maintain certain temps and provide certain foods but again they are easy to come by. Mine have given me hours of enjoyment in just watching them and learning each of their behavior. They are a big commitment and before purchasing one you better do all the research into having one.
5duq5DHnaa	Boxers are goofballs and they never really grow out of it. So the behavior you see now will probably be around for a while!! They love to play and need plenty of exercise. You should start training EARLY.. it is not to early to start now. Boxers are very smart and eager to please their owners. Boxers can be destructive when left alone so crate training is probably a good idea.|`|5yhitoY0aa	Any dogs needs proper training and boxer is a perfect one for it.You can train him to do what ever you want.As the nature of the boxer is to please the master more than other dogs so you can utilize him to the maximum if the proper training is given to him|`|X7i59NeIaa	They love to run around and just and play with toys. A good floppy to y they can shake is great. They also really like squeaky toys and chew toys like braided ropes etc. They also like to sleep a lot. Make food available to them at all times and they will create their own eating pattern and always keep fresh clean water available to them. Have fun with your new pup. Boxers are just so darned cute.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Eating, drinking, playing, sleeping, pooing and peeing (not necessarily in that order).
n5VnN73raa	if it is cotton like it is a fungus, but if it looks like little grains of salt it is ick. Both of which can be treated with store bought meds. You will want to keep the tank at a constant temp around 72 degrees. Do a 25% water change before starting treatments.|`|zbJclbgIaa	you probably have ick  you need to medicate the whole tank. or fish will die. or it could be a fungus witch is not quite a serious. if the pimple like spots are spreading all over the fish and to other fish its probably ick|`|MG8MwZrIaa	Definitely sounds like ick!  You can get special meds in drop form at the pet store.  Follow the directions carefully or ask someone there how to use it.  I used it a few months ago and it cleared up the problem.  But some fish might still die.  But hopefully you can save the stronger ones.  Good luck!|`|R8BFzkzPaa	Sounds like ick. This is a parasite. Get some meds from your local pet store to treat it.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)
R8BFzkzPaa	It's normal. This is just the type of angelfish it is. There are people out there who would pay a lot of money for a good blue/green angelfish!! They're not commonly come by, so you're pretty lucky :)|`|H06PtiIAaa	wild angelfish are silver but they can have a bluish tint, but getting wild angelfish is rather hard unless you import them or bought them from a breeder.<br>  <br>  But yes large silver angelfish will tend to have a tint to them if you look close enough
x8Vgu6acaa	Dalmationa are a high energy dog not suited for everyone.  Due the their recent popularity because of the 101 dalmation craze, they were overbred and placed in the wrong type homes.  Giving them an undeserved bad rap.  They are beautiful dogs but are not the easiest dogs to live with.  A few years ago everyone wanted one and then dropped them off in the shelters because they were not like the perfect little cartoon dogs.  <br>  Actually it is a good thing that they lost popularity.  Now they can be placed in suitable forever homes instead of bought by people on a whim.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Because they are quite difficult dogs and definitely not for your average inexperienced owner.<br>  <br>  They are wonderful for the right person,  but I don't think I'd ever recommend them to someone without dog experience.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	I don't know about everywhere, but Dalmatians are a dime a dozen in the shelters & rescues here. They aren't a breed for everyone for sure. And they aren't dumb. They'll learn most anything if food is involved! They are like a lot of other active breeds, they need lots of consistent training. I know some very lovely Dalmatians, most of them rescues, that run Agility & do Obedience too.|`|oGVWdnHraa	Probably because they are so dumb *rolls eyes* lol :) I still love them though :D<br>  <br>  ADD: This is a pic of me, Morgan and Turbo, that I just took :D<br>  <a href="http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh292/bubble_brunna/IMG000014.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i259.photobucket.com/albums/hh292...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ADD: Aww thanks :D Morgan, the one who is upside down lol came from a farm (he came from a good breeder, the people who purchased him didnt look after him) where he was just left to run around with another dog there :( He got barely any attention and had REALLY bad ear problems :( His ears are much better now, though he does yelp sometimes if you push on his ears :( I love these Dals a lot, but I dont think I would ever own one (these two are my aunty and uncles, I am living with them whilst I am at uni) they shed a bit too much for me :D I honestly have no idea how they have ANY fur left lol :)|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	There are lots of breeds that get overlooked.  I suppose since labs are a pretty popular breed currently, that's why people always suggest them.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I don't know why people suggest certain breeds on here anyway.  My stock answer is always "do research on some breeds that interest you," OR "look at your local shelter and talk to the staff about what you are looking for."<br>  <br>  I own a lab, and I would personally not recommend that breed to a random stranger on the internet.  They are a lot of work.|`|VtHvcEtuaa	Dalmations are not very common in most areas.  In my town, Goldens and Labs are so overpopulated.  I have the only bullmastiff in my town! It's not that people don't think they are a great breed, I just think people are not very familiar with them.  Keep suggesting them and telling people moe about the breed though!|`|cvNN6l9Daa	I have worked in a vet clinic since 1994 starting out as a tech over the summers during college and then 4 years of vet school.  In our books, dalmatians, chows, shar peis, chihuahuas, and St. Bernards were our "no no" list.  They tended to be unruly at best and aggressive at worst.  Most were poorly socialized AND they had health problems, so they had to have intense visits, with ear cleaning, bloodowork, skin scraping, etc. <br>  <br>  Then, between my second and third year in vet school, a young male, intact dalmatian showed up at my parents' house, humping my step brother's dog.  He was so skittish that it took 3 weekend visits before I finally caught him as he ran by.  I started petting him and feeding him and when I opened my car door, he jumped in.  That summer, I worked as a photographer's assistant and was often working from home on the computer.  Tops (spot backwards) was sweet, but scared.  He snapped at me once, when I was giving him a shot and my b/f didn't hold him correctly.  However, he became totally devoted to me.  I instigated the "nothing in life is free" training method and he learned, without me having to alpha-roll him, that I was the boss.  However, he is scared of kids, he will snap when frightened, has thunderstorm phobia, and he transfers aggression to our other dog when I tell him to do something.  He is pretty high energy and very athletic, even though he has a heart murmur (aortic stenosis, mild and no need for treatment).  But he is well mannered, because we do not allow him to be a Bumpass hound.<br>  <br>  Dalmatians have a laundry list of health problems.  Over 40% of them are deaf in one ear and 20% are deaf in both ears.  They also have a problem processing certain amino acids and create urate crystals in the urine, which turn into stones in many dogs.  If the dalmatian breeders would do a few generations of out breeding to white pointers, this problem could be eliminated.  Epilepsy seems to be a very common problem with them (mine does not have this).  With the deafness comes some behavioral problems: they can't triangulate if they can only hear out of one ear and you can startle them easily.  The deaf ones seem to be more timid and nervous.<br>  They are good dogs to have with horses because that is what they were bred for: running along side horses.  They can run very fast and for long distances.  They also do not chase and bite at the horses' feet like a heeler would.  So, for a family that is well versed in training dogs without aggressive techniques (like alpha rolling and the Cesar finger snapping) and people that want to do distance running, biking, riding, etc, they are great dogs.  Mine is a house dog.  He does not chase or attack the cat.  He likes to boss around his house mate (a much larger female lab) and is scared of other dogs (he was fine until a german shepherd attacked me and then Tops jumped him and got beaten up).  He doesn't tear things up or bark all of the time.  He walks away from things he doesn't like (ie kids).  But he is not trust worthy and he would not be a good dog in another house.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	No dog is for everyone, but Dalmations are certainly not for those with no experience. I know a lady who has one, brings him in verrry public places (like tennis meets), but throws a *fit* if you get too close. Why? He's somewhat aggressive, not trained at all (despite being several years old) and she has no clue what to do.<br>  <br>  I see a lot of breeds being too quickly and easily recommended, when they aren't for everyone either. Herding breeds especially, and toy breeds as well.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	They weren't so much back a few years ago. When did 101 Dalmations come out?<br>  Everyone HAD to have one then.<br>  <br>  Now the BYBs have backed off them, so they really aren't as easily obtained to the general public.<br>  <br>  A great breed nonetheless, just some people will typically suggest a more common breed.|`|NbvTyN7saa	The generally don't make the best family dogs.  They are very active, a bit hyper, can get aggressive if all that energy is not constantly burned off.<br>  <br>  Lovely, country dogs.|`|W7UpXXQGaa	i was told Dalmatians are not good with kids|`|Re576Xa5aa	because a pro should have them. My friend and I were circled by one for like 10 minuites while this pathetic owner was calling her dog. It didn't listen to her at all. She kept yelling it was friendly. Umm it had already bitten me Lady! . It bit me twice, Do you really want to see your breed maligned like that?<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  yes I know I will be "thumbs downed", thank you very much but his is the harsh reality.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	*Most dalmatians aren't properly breed and have terrible temperament problems. (aggression issues)<br>  *They are not good for first time dog owners either (At least that's how I personally feel)<br>  *They have high amounts of health problems like deafness. <br>  *And they can be stubborn/difficult to train. (Not making them ideal for family pets)<br>  *They are very high energy as well. (can become very destructive, need a lot of "personal" time, and exercise)|`|SZdSFi1raa	My Aunt and Uncle used to have dalmatians but they were very hyper and they didn't have the time to work with them. I have also heard that they may be too energetic for young children.<br>  <br>  Check out this website for more information about dalmatians:<br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogprofile.do?id=1490" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a>|`|U4cYbkNQaa	They are very hyper and want your attention all of the time. Most people don't have the time that they require. Dogs are wonderful pets and can be a long time friend. It is very important that you choose the right breed for you and your family.|`|IIIKFDOoaa	Because some people think that those dogs are cuter or come from a champion bloodline. But I agree, Dalmatians are great, cute, sweet, loyal and one of the most heroic dogs (fire-fighters) ever in history.|`|ZmP4zSJ3aa	When i considered getting a puppy, I was told not to choose a dalmation because they are mean and not a good pet to have with children.

It was so frustrating. He was very friendly but not good with kids just cuz of his size. He was pure and registered. I ended up re homing him cuz of this. I just think they are stupid dogs, i have never met an intelligent dalmatian. I now have a 4 month old labrador and her intelligence at 4 months surpasses the intelligence that my 4 year old dalmatian has before i re homed him. I tried obedience classes, im a good dog trainer and i couldnt get anything through to him nor could the instructors and various obedience classes. Labradors and retreivers are much more popular because they are smart, willing and able and also very loving and loyal. Although dalmatians are gorgeous to look at, i think they are the barbie of dog breeds, so attractive to most but no brains up stairs!|`|fgxajTiBaa	Because they're still being fixed after the 101 Dalmations fiasco.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Labs and Retrievers are more popular.

yyf5N7Ogaa	My dog came from Rescue, we got him at 2 years old, and he was the same way. I don't think he understood what toys were and why he might like them.<br>  <br>  Be very patient. Just put the toys out and let her discover them for herself. Don't act stressed, and don't worry. Let her determine what games she wants to play. Try a variety of toys adding one at a time. Some dogs like stuffed toys, some like chew toys, some like balls - each dog is different. And some dogs never do play and that's OK too.<br>  <br>  My dog is very food motivated so he now loves his Buster Cube, and his Tricky Treater  and his MolycuBall. It has taken several years, yes years, to get him interested in toys. He still doesn't play as much as some other dogs, but he will sometimes play fetch, and carries his stuffed toy around once in awhile. He does likes to play hide and seek with his food toys.|`|O4qO8aoLaa	Well, some dogs just dont play with toys.  They arent interested.  You might be able to get them professionally trained if its that important to you.  When I got my dog she doesnt like them either.  We play in other ways like running outside and roughing her up and she loves it.  Depending how old your dog is might be too late to get them to like toys and play with them.  Good luck.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	Well, it depends on what breed you have. A lot of dogs don't like toys right away. If they sense you like them, then they tend to play with them just to get your attention.|`|cbTlfqc0aa	Keep messing with your dog-- eventually the dog comes around....|`|2vFeboXgaa	my dog is 7 yrs old. actually we recently adopted him and he does the same thing. he wont play with any toys. i dont know what to do...|`|AA10412922	Many rescues aren't into toys,it may be a lack of exposure when they were younger.Try bullys or flossies for her to chew and forget about toys
1omgPICKaa	Hi, specifically, which feathers did you cut?<br>  <br>  Please be aware that clipping the bird's wings will not stop it from flying. It only takes a small breeze and a parrot, especially a cockatiel, can fly with it. He may take off if something frightens him. The best method for taking a bird outside is to use a harness (the two I reccomend are the Flight Suit and Aviator).<br>  <br>  It is uncommon, but some birds do get upset about having their wings clipped. It may also depend on which ones you clipped though. If he seems very upset about it all, just give him plenty of love and attention and maybe not clip him in the future when they grow back.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope all goes well.|`|AA11927520	You could buy him a special bird treat and a new bird toy for when he is in his cage.<br>  <br>  Also our Cockatiels like boiled egg, cooled off and cut up in a small bowl.<br>  Only give like half or less at a time because even though it is a treat they do not always eat all of it.  They also like cooked rice, macaroni, spaghetti etc plain and cooled off.  Millet seed branches are another treat that you can find in some pet shops. <br>  <br>  I would warn you to be very careful about taking your Cockatiel outside because there wing feathers sometimes will grow back enough to fly before you realize it.  <br>  Even if he can't fly indoors.... yet with a little feather growth his wings might be able to catch a breeze and away he goes!|`|sdEvcpKwaa	Well, he is probably sad that he can't fly anymore. He will get used to it though. Just make sure you spend some extra quality time with him to make him happier! <br>  <br>  Some people might tell you to get a mirror, but please don't. He will grow so attached to that mirror that he won't want to spend time with you.|`|yet0QXKQaa	If you cut the ings too short, you might have done some damage, and he could be hurt, I'd take him to the vet just to be sure. My bird bled once when his wings were cut.
vRe8PAnsaa	Is "badly" a word?|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Don't ever attempt to sneak a dog in because it end in 99% heartache! You'll parents will take you & the puppy to the local animal shelter & dumb it there, as another UNWANTED animal.<br>  <br>  Don't buy from newspaper, onlines websites or petstores. Avoid next day pets.They are puppy mills.<br>  <br>  WHY DO YOU WANT A DOG?<br>   The first question you should ask yourself, honestly is .  .  .  Why do I (we) want a dog?<br>  If your answer is:<br>  <br>  For my son/daughter/children . . . Trust me, this will be YOUR dog!  After the 'honeymoon period', the kids may only play with the dog, occasionally.  They may groan and grumble about any dog-related responsibilities, doing them, begrudgingly, only after significant prodding from you.  As children's interests and activities change, over the years, their level of involvement with the dog will most likely be, inconsistent, at best.  Additionally, your children, especially, young children, will need to be 'trained' in how to behave with the dog and will need to be supervised when with the dog.<br>  <br>  For protection . . . I know some may disagree but, it is my opinion, that the only time is it a good idea to get a dog for the purpose of protection is in professional or agricultural situations and only when the owner/trainer is humane and knowledgeable of dog behavior and dominant dog training/handling.  In all other situations - probably 99.9% - an alarm system, security fence, or other measures are much more appropriate and effective. <br>  <br>  To breed puppies . . . If you've read the third paragraph of this piece and still feel this way, there is probably little I can offer to change your mind.  But, just in case, let me restate the case a little more thoroughly.  The breeding of dogs is a responsibility not to be taken lightly.  If it is not your intention to remain responsible for all of your puppies for their entire lives, including being willing to take back and care for those who may find themselves homeless, do not enter into this endeavor.  If you are planning on breeding for profit, understand that there are much easier, more profitable and ethical ways to make a buck.  Dogs are living beings and dog breeding requires a significant investment of time, money, labor, knowledge, both academic and practical, patience, and emotional fortitude, to be done responsibly and humanely.  Please visit a few of the shelter and rescue websites, or your local shelter, and witness the problem yourself.  View the faces of the homeless dogs and talk to the volunteers and staff who, all too often, must take that 'final walk' with them.<br>  <br>  Because BreedX is 'Cool', was in a movie you saw, is unique and exotic, is free/cheap, or other such nonsense .  .  . One of the WORSE reasons to get a dog, or any other animal, for that matter, is because of their physical appearance or popularity due to a movie, TV show, or other publicity.  Often, these venues feature exotic, rare or unique breeds that are, in the overwhelming majority of pet situations, unsuitable as companions.  This visibility may also draw out those 'breeders' whose primary motivation is profit versus health, temperament, structural soundness and the welfare of their dogs.<br>  <br>  And, remember to incorporate the same thoughtful consideration on whether or not to get a dog, and which breed or mix, when your friend, coworker or relative offers you one of Fluffy's puppies.  Dogs are never really 'free' or 'cheap' and, in reality, require significant financial, physical, time, and environmental resources.  At a minimum, none of these, or other such reasons, are sound selection factors for getting a dog and selecting a particular breed or mix.  And, remember, if it is difficult for you to find information on a particular breed, or a breeder of the breed, it follows that you will most likely also have difficulty finding local support services that are familiar with the training, health care, and maintenance needs of that breed.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Here's a dogfinder link that can help you find a puppy near your place. You just have to enter your zip code and answer a few questions, and you should be done. Have you figured out, by the way, what breed you should get?<br>  <br>  Goodluck!<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/finder/edit" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/finder/edit</a>|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Wow, kid there is a TON more that you need to know before getting a pup. <br>  Do you even know what breed you want?<br>  Different breeds require different care, just stating any puppy will likely not be ideal for you or the dog.<br>  <br>  Add: If you know what breed you want, why wouldn't you state it in here?|`|W3KqA9t1aa	You don't want a puppy; you want a dog. They are only puppies for about 6 months and then you have a dog. <br>  <br>   Whenever anyone says they want a puppy my brain shuts them out. They are never serious about getting a pet and the animal ends up in a shelter..|`|oQxmkVGhaa	go to the pound and save a puppy! its cheaper too!|`|OfAAeCDraa	definitely if you want to get a puppy you should know how to raise and afford one     once you are ready to get one you should go to the pound and get one the ones at the pound are sooooo cute|`|XxnOIOaxaa	The best thing to do would be to go to your local pound and adopt one.|`|mLlf4XXxaa	Try out nextdaypets.com as well...

1YNhKzeqaa	If she is pregnant, its not just one baby... its lots of babies.<br>  <br>  Pregnant fish tend to stay close to the heater and eat less. Her belly will look squarish when shes about to give birth.<br>  <br>  What you should do is provide hiding places in the tank for her to give birth in. You don't want her to get stressed out by other tank mates while she is giving birth. They tend to like hiding spots closer to the heater.<br>  <br>  Provide plant cover for the fry so they don't get eaten. I use live plants in my tank, my current set up includes micro sword for the fry.<br>  <br>  In my very first tank, I used water sprite, it is hardy, grows very well, and provides plenty of cover. I didn't even need fertilizer or CO2, I would actually advise against fertilizer and CO2 for water sprite, as it will very rapidly take over your tank if you do add it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some people prefer to put the mother in a separate tank for giving birth, I don't like to, as this can put extra stress on her, and puts extra stress on your wallet.<br>  <br>  Another option is a breeders box clipped on to the top inside of the main tank. This keeps the fry safe from adults.<br>  <br>  For the previous two options be sure to remove the mother from the breeding tank or box after she gives birth, or she might just help herself to a little post-labor snack. Yep, even mommy dearest will eat her children. (Talk about tough love!)<br>  <br>  Good luck :D

O6SBsgO8aa	Any dog would be good with the cats(as long as it is intruduced well) and it is usually up to the cats if they will let it.  A dogs behaviour for the most part is how YOU train it.|`|kLEiXXmyaa	www.dogbreedinfo.com<br>  <br>  They have a quiz and it includes that question of whether you have cats or not.|`|C0T0hV4haa	A toy poodle or bichon sounds like a good choice to me.

I have seven dogs and three cats. They all get along fine. I have three poms and my husband has 3 terriers and then we have a very old chow/Siberian husky cross.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Any of the breeds mentioned could be trained to be good with cats. Google "introduce dogs and cats" for some suggestions on how to start off on the right foot. If possible, find a breeder who has cats in the home so the puppy has already been around cats.<br>  <br>  If you decide to adopt a slightly used dog, have the shelter or rescue do a cat reaction test to see how the dogs responds to cats.
7HrVzMCOaa	One process that I went through trying to name my new pet was just watching it.  Watch some of it's actions, i.e. my bird liked to dance, so I considered naming her Tango.<br>  Look through a baby naming book.  Find one you think matches it's personality.<br>  If you speak a foreign language or own a foreign language dictionary, look up a word that represents the personality best.  i.e. heart = corazón, bear = soportar.<br>  This is your pet, so choose something you like and will not get tired of saying!|`|GPg9MWqSaa	Double-stuffed! jk ,but if you used it that would be so awesome....hmmm i have never had a boy hamster b4 so idk besides for some reason if you name your pet you will have a stronger bond with it|`|uC2OAc4Kaa	Ohh I had one but with a white face I named him spot... Then i hated that name but then i named him Tiquila I liked it but i loved Mr.Boo because when he hid in his bedding and peeked out it was so cute !!!|`|Y5FyAekkaa	Name him Sing Sing or Ping. If you name him Ping please get a second one and name him Pong...it would make my day.
ubF6sY1Daa	My German Shepherd has these as well. Clean it out real well with regular doggie ear cleaner.<br>  <br>  Get some Monastat like for female human yeast infestions that is the cream that you fill in tubes. Do NOT use the capsules!!!! Put probubly about a pea size amount on your finger and put in the ear and massage. Do this about everyother day until the ear looks not irritated and doesn't smell like an ear infection does. You'll no when it has subsided Then As a Preventative they make this stuff called ear drying cream that when you put it inthe ear it is a cream but drys to a powder and therefor helps keep the ear canel dry which in turn helps keep the yeast under control. Especially if your dog gets in the water.Dry the ears out immediatly and put this cream in. <br>  <br>  Every GSD I have ever had has gotton cronic ear infections and my mom is a certified breeder and this is what she told me to do and it has saved me and my dogs allot of time and money just buying these 3 little products which all you can get at walmart. The Generic Monistate works to. Let me know if you need more help as it can be confuseing your first time. But it works I Swear by it. And By the Way I checked with my vet and he said it was perfectly fine as long as you don't drown the ear in the monastat just enough to lightly coat the inside of the ear not fill it all the way to the ear drum. it will work its way down toowhere it needs it.|`|BSlVGJ62aa	<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4610641_dogs-ear-yeast-infection-vet.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4610641_dogs-ear...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Try this. Hope i helped. I am dog lover.|`|bicAgoycaa	Yeast infections are reaccuring. Once your dog gets them, they will always get them. You need to clean your dog regularly. Your doctor can give you prescriptions for that.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Use Zymox.. IF you are sure it's a yeast infection.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	First, yes go to a vet to get antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The vet will give you drops to put in the dogs ears to clean them once a month.<br>  My beagle was prone to dirty ears due to floppy ears that held moisture.  You have to clean the dogs ears every month before it reaches the infection point.<br>  <br>  Tip: Vets aren't like regular doctors.  They won't be like "500 bucks, pay me or the dog doesn't get fixed."  Often, they'll ask "How much can you pay today?" meaning they'll be flexible to your budget if that's what's holding you back.  <br>  My vet asked how much could I pay.  I said "150.00 today, and I can pay more next week if that's what it takes to fix the doggie." He says "No, that's enough" and the bill came out to $148.95.|`|cvNN6l9Daa	A recurring infection (bacteria or yeast) in the ears is common with food allergies.  If you want a "home remedy" or holistic approach, try a low antigen food trial for 4-6 weeks.  This means that your dog can have nothing but a special diet (called a novel protein diet) where they eat food made up of either proteins that have been broken down so that they are so tiny the immune system will not react to them or they are fed something that they have never eaten before (like Eukanuba's kangaroo and oats diet).  Then, if their ears calm down, you start, (just like a baby) and add foods a week at a time until you find out what they are reacting to.  Common problem foods: grains like corn or wheat, chicken (this is NOT because these are bad foods but because most dogs have eaten these products and are more likely to be sensitized to them).<br>  <br>  Beyond that, hormonal disorders like hypothyroidism and Cushings disease commonly predispose dogs to these infections.<br>  <br>  DO NOT start putting random liquids in your dog's ears.  First, you have to make sure that the ear drums are intact so that topical meds are safe.  Then, if the yeast is the only problem, use something just for yeast, not for bacteria and yeast.  In most dogs, we see bacteria and yeast messing up ears together.  We use this paste that we have compounded at a pharmacy: lanolin, an antibiotic, an antifungal, and an anti-inflammatory.  The best part is that we put it in the ears, it stays in there for 2 weeks (you don't have to medicate everyday) and then we remove it.  We clean the ears (under sedation) and take a good look at the ear drums prior to doing it.  We have cured a number of dogs using this method.  You can also treat with oral antifungals.  I would also start a probiotic like Probios or Fortiflora.<br>  <br>  This is the pharmacy where we have ours made.<br>  <a href="http://www.bcpvetpharm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcpvetpharm.com/</a>|`|ydshiNrKaa	None. It's an infection which needs antibiotics to clear it up. Take the dog to the vet as he is in pain and discomfort.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	No, you need the correct medication for yeast. It sucks, but if you try to keep the dog's ear cleaner, it might help.|`|AA10112346	home phone-->>>VET

Best of luck.|`|2nvTL4giaa	Good to hear if your cat is pregnant...|`|LpTeRiHXaa	She probably is pregnant if her stomach is growing like that and her nipples are getting larger. It's usually not too hard to tell, and I doubt she has tumors; also, sometimes if you place your hand on the cat's belly for a while, you can actually feel the babies kick. <br>  <br>  Yay if she is pregnant :)|`|AA11015395	Take her to the vet let the Dr check her out to be on the safe side
5TM9P8tsaa	*I raise crickets. They do not need much light but do need some to stay healthy. They need food and water. They love tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet potatoes. I feed my feeder crickets flake fish food and oatmeal besides.

AlAqoQABaa	Most breeders list the puppies for an average of 450 a pup. Some go as high as 800. Getting a certification of hips definitely adds value to your dogs. It increases the stability of your line since you would know not to breed one who had the disease. It also increases the wellness of the overall breed. Dogs who have been bred correctly without deformities and diseases will help preserve the breed in its original form. You should also do this to prevent an legal trouble that may in sue if the person you sold it to wants to give the dog back and get a refund. Your main goal, however, should not be how much money you make but how well you are breeding and taking care of the puppies and mom. Hip certification is the sign of a competent breeder.|`|1prFATCBaa	Certifying that the dog has no hip "displacia" (correctly spelled- dysplasia) is not a  quarantee of quality and should have little or no bearing on the price of the dog.<br>  <br>  What is his pedigree? Is he intact?  Is he worthy of being shown/bred? What titles does he have- or do his parents have?  What other health clearances have been performed?<br>  <br>  How has he been raised?  Fed? Socialized? Trained?  <br>  <br>  There are so many factors that determine price- if you don't know what your dog is worth- you should not be breeding- and you certainly can't ask a bunch of strangers to assess value on a dog they have never seen!|`|AxtJPPDsaa	It would add value to ahve the hip garantee. depending on your location you should be able to get at least $250-$350.... almsot any AKC will sell for that...you could try $500 and see how it goes then lower your price later.....from exp. Labs are harder to sell b/c they are so popular and easy to find....but is they have good bloodlines, champion ect you can get alot mor efor them|`|NSATjDJkaa	It all depends.  Is this your first time breeding?  Are both parents registered?  Are you giving them their shots and dewormer?  If you have the certificate for hip displacia you can up the price by about $40.  Other than that, it ranges.  Check out puppyfind.com and you will get an idea.
XEzSAErkaa	Southern Agriculture in Broken Arrow (Elm and 81st) is reasonable...not cheap, though.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Please stop worrying about price and start researching into what you cat needs to live a long happy life. Your cat is depending on you to educate yourself.<br>  Treatment of Chronic Renal Failure<br>  <br>  If your cat is not in final stages, this is not want you want to do. You do not want to put your cat on the<br>  Vets low protein diet. There are simply so many better options out there than to hand the poor cat a low amount of poor quality protein - which often results in a poor appetite and muscle wasting since the body is now robbing its own muscle mass to feed itself a decent quality and amount of protein.<br>  . There are new thoughts on this and the thinking is it is not the amount of protein but the quality of protein that matters.<br>  The Merck veterinary manual [www.merckvetmanual.com] says that cats need "4 g of protein of high biologic value per kg body wt/day". That's about 7 calories from protein per pound body weight per day. If a cat isn't a good eater and consumes, say, 20 calories per pound per day, then 7/20 = 35% of calories can safely be from protein. It must be high quality protein, which means meat, fish, milk, and eggs, and not grain or soy. <br>  <br>  I am under the assumption that you have been feeding mostly dry foods. Many use a vegetable based protein instead of animal and that is part of the problem.. Your cat needs protein as it is a carnivore and cutting down on it will lead to other health issues and may cause faster degeneration.<br>  You want to cut down on phosphorous (no fish allowed now) <br>  <br>  The best way to do this is with a raw diet which you can make yourself or buy. (Making yourself is better) link provided at the bottom<br>  If you are unwilling to do that then something like the non fish flavors of Wellness or Merrick with NO grains are good alternatives. Wysong is also a good canned choice. This list gives a breakdown. Remember you want low phosphorous <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/CanFoodOld.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/CanFo...</a><br>  <br>   You should be giving sub-Q fluids as needed.<br>  <br>  <br>  You also will want to look into phosphorous binders. Something like aluminum hydroxide<br>  Ask your vet or look into calcitrol<br>  <br>  <br>  You may want to talk to the vet about having injectable Pepcid AC on hand or you can buy it in pill form (ac not plain pepcid) and give 1/4 tab for stomach upset which happens a lot in crf cats due to acid in the stomach.<br>  I hope this stuff helps, here are many links for you<br>  Making cat food<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/makingcatfood.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/makingcatfood.htm</a><br>  other links.

cfbc847f69b8c58c2a9f0c1c7fd702c4aa	If this was your child would you take it to the doctor or just give it some aspirin?  My dog was injured like yours and sometimes he was ok and other times not so much.  After a vet visit we found out his injury created a bone eating bacteria and we had to put him on antibiotics or it would completely eat his bones.  Just for the record, it's not $1000.  X-rays run about $30-60 and the sedation is about $10 if he needs it.  $100 should be on the high end to get him checked out.  More than likely he just injured it and it gets well and he goes full force and re-injured it before it could heal completely.  Give it a week and try to keep him "inactive" where he isn't running, jumping, and all of the stresses on his legs.  If it doesn't improve I would surely see a vet.  Also, stop looking at the $$.  Consider your dog part of your family and take care of it medically like you would any other family member.  Good luck and I hope he gets better.|`|gjD8pndjaa	This is just a guess, I'm no vet and I've never met the dog, but I've known several large breed dogs with Panosteitis<br>  <br>  Its literally just growing pains.

I38WF5aFaa	I have nothing against breeding rabbits but I don't think you should breed your doe.  Your other questions indicate that you don't know what breed she is.  Therefore you don't know how to select a buck to breed her with.  You don't need to be making mix breed rabbits.  Before breding rabbits I recommend reading the book "Storey's Guide to Raising Rabbits" by Bob Bennett.  Its the most informative book I know about rabbits.  its mostly about meat rabbits but the info about rabbit health and breeding applies to all rabbits.|`|meMF69tXaa	Hun, if you don't know all these answers already, then you should probably not be breeding your doe. <br>  <br>  If people want to breed for the better of the breed, they need much knowledge and need to understand the standards for that particular breed. They need to understand the genetics involved, especially the colors and the birth defects. They need to understand the whole kindling process and everything else that comes along with rabbit kits.<br>  <br>  Are you prepared to spend the money if your doe should have complications during or after birth? Are you prepared to deal with a kit that has the X factor or splay leg if you are breeding dwarf rabbits? Are you prepared to deal with other genetic issues that can complicate the life of a kit? <br>  <br>  I'm really not trying to give you a lecture here, just trying to make you think ahead of time before you start this process. I have bred my netherlands before and it was a hard process to find good stock, raise healthy kits, take care of my doe and buck and find GOOD HOMES for my buns. Which is why I don't breed anymore but rather keep my rabbits as pets.|`|CkRinxFzaa	Breed it with a bunny that's about the same size or smaller.<br>  How to breed: Put the buck in a box or cage (2-3 sq. ft is about good). Then put your doe in the same box/cage.<br>  The buck should try to breed. Watch carefully, if he falls back then your doe should be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to the first person who was talking about shelters...it's much more fun to breed your own rabbit and watch the babies grow. And NetherlandHolly was wrong, i've breed & raised at minimum 20+ bunnies & have never had health issues with my bunnies.<br>  <br>  As for get a buck, you'll have to buy one unless you have a friend who will lend u theirs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ya!|`|sdEvcpKwaa	there are hundreds of homeless bunnies that need homes. If you know people that want bunnies they should adopt some from shelters!<br>  <br>  If you really love bunnies you won't breed them. You would allow homeless bunnies a chance at home.<br>  <br>  And you shouldn't breed if you don't know what you are doing anyway.
sdEvcpKwaa	No, that isn't true. They do get lonely. But they do not get along with other rabbits living in a small space. <br>  <br>  So if you have one rabbit, don't get another one, just spend more time with him.|`|xTT13wFmaa	Well rabbits are closely related to guinea pigs and i had a guinea pig which died of loneliness. Then when i got another one it was showing the same symptoms my first pig had before it died. So i bought another pig to see how my other piggie would react, and she ended up the happiest little piggie. I had them both for five or six years. Rabbits may be different. I'd be safe and buy some kind of friend for your rabbit whether it be another rabbit or a guinea pig.|`|puMZ0bgmaa	I keep my rabbit in a huge playpen in the living room during the day.  He's not directly in a room with the family, but he can hear us all day and gets all the hallway traffic passing right by him.  He is playful and loving.  I cannot imagine someone keeping a rabbit in a small cage all day, that would be horrible!|`|WwTxboY9aa	NO, they love to have company, my sisters bunny loves hanging out with the cats, and seems depressed if he has no company .|`|9p7eUgYqaa	No that is not true.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	No. They miss the company of other Rabbits but will settle for human companionship.  Most creatures do.  Keeping a single goldfish in a bowl is cruel. They are not stupid.  Other species just like humans need companionship.
U4cYbkNQaa	No, they have protective oils in their hair, and if they were to go outside for any substantial amount of time, they could get sunburned. Comb them and give them Front line or Resolution to kill the fleas.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	DO NOT SHAVE THEM<br>  Beagles have a short enough coat as it is.

f6c72MTmaa	No it's not bad unless you spend time with it when you have the chance. I own one small pony Riley, and i go there every weekend. He lives far away but my Aunt feed's him when he doesnt have food and water. As long he/her is healthy and has plenty of drinking water & food she/he will be fine|`|IFL3GcM9aa	I assume that when you say you will feed the horse, you mean pay for the feed, and others will actually feed the horse from day to day when you aren't there. (I mention this because there are some people who think they can throw hay in a field and the horses will feed themselves all week.  This is not a good idea.)<br>  <br>  If, however, your horse is being boarded and well cared for by others when you aren't there, it is possible to have a happy horse even if you don't visit more than once a week.  Especially if there are other horses around. <br>  <br>  Still, you will never have as good a relationship with a horse you only visit on weekends.  And if the horse is young and not handled by people daily, it could undo some of its training. <br>  <br>  So in the end, it depends on what kind of care and handling the horse is getting when you aren't there, and also what your family wants out of the horse.|`|2NpsC5vPaa	It depends, is this horse going to be kept in a field or paddock?  By himself or with other horses?  Or kept in a box stall all day? Sounds like it won't be kept on your parent's property, are there other people at the barn that can give him some exercise?  If it is kept in a stall all week long, then no just visiting on weekends is not a great idea.  Horses need exercise and company.  And if they plan to ride it on the weekend they may find it's too frisky and hard to handle after being cooped up all week.  Horse ownership is a big responsibility.  Do you or your parents have previous experiences owning a horse? <br>  <br>  Hope that helped a little.

xCSZ3M3Raa	Don't worry yet.  My dog sometimes poops three or four times a day and other times he has gone a whole day without pooping and is fine.  It could be the new environment, or he just doesn't have to go yet.  Just watch him and if he doesn't go tomorrow after eating well, then you might want to check with a vet.  You said he hasn't eaten much yet so just relax.|`|c4225d9583bacc6aaa33ccf6f6ca917aaa	if he hasnt eaten a lot, then he wont poo.. wait til he eats more and see if he goes tomorrow.  after my dog got spayed and stayed in the vet for a few days, she didnt poo for 3 days afterwards.. just traumatized.. so nothing to worry about yet.. after a couple of days or so, and no poo, ask a vet and they may recommend some foods to help him need to go|`|YnWwcUPTaa	add a little vege oil to the feed.|`|1xBhHvGzaa	IT's only four hours!

Give him some time to get adjusted.  Also if he hasn't eaten anything, then there isn't anything in there to poop out.  Once he settles in he'll get on a schedule and things will start moving.|`|8cikAYp3aa	dogs tend to one of two paths when stressed.

fjuQYf9caa	Rats should not be kept in glass tanks as they do not provide enough ventilation which results in a build up of ammonia, given off by the rats urine, which is harmful to a rats respiratory system.<br>  <br>  Wire/Barred cages are the best environment for rats as they allow for excellent ventillation and also provide oppertunuites for them to climb which they enjoy very much, especially females.<br>  <br>  A cage designed for a hamster or gerbil is not suitable however as they are way too small! To find out how many rats a cage is suitable for take the measurements and use the cage calculator at the following link.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fancy-rats.co.uk/information/guides/cagecalculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fancy-rats.co.uk/information/...</a><br>  <br>  Rats should be kept in a minimum of pairs and never alone as they can suffer greatly from loneliness. You may think that you can offer it plenty of companionship but a rat cannot communicate or play with you in the way it can with another rat. Even if you had your rat out for 12 hours a day there's still 12 hours of loneliness to endure with no one to play with. Rats can even die from being kept alone so if any cage you have is suitable for any less than two rats it cannot be used.<br>  <br>  Please discourage your friend from keeping a single rat and from keeping rats in a hamster cage, it's simply unfair to the animal! Plus if she can't afford a cage then how can she afford vets bills should anything happen to the little guys?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, if you need any more information then feel free to contact me!<br>  <br>  Lloyd!|`|i5zBmtqRaa	make sure that the rat can't fit through.  You also need to take into consideration that a rat's feet could get damaged from the wire bars.|`|KeevlZnTaa	Rats are supposed to be kept in wire cages, not glass. Fish tanks/Glass tanks do not offer enouogh circulation and can cause ammonia build up from urine, and damage rats sensitive respiratory systems.<br>  <br>  Be sure that the cage is large enough. Rats need a lot more space than a hamster or a gerbil(2 cubic feet per rat), and also need to be kept on pairs. Most hamster and gerbil cages and not even close to being large enough for a rat.|`|YqVtOSWwaa	Rats NEED wire cages. Glass aquariums have terrible air circulation, and cause dirty air from their waste to collect, forcing them to breathe it. This commonly causes breathing issues, especially in rats, who have sensitive respiratory systems.<br>  <br>  Size is another tremendously important factor to consider. An ideal cage for rats is one that is designed for ferrets, chinchillas, or rabbits. Hamster or gerbil cages are in no way appropriately sized to house even one rat! I use a hamster cage to carry my rats to the vet, not live in!! <br>  <br>  Please do proper research on your pet. Rats are not easy pets to keep. There is a lot you can very easily do wrong with them, and wind up with sick or just miserable that die young, or require expensive medical treatment. <br>  <br>  One of those things is providing the rat with a companion. Rats are social animals, and strongly rely on other rats to live happily and comfortably. Single rats are more stressed, unsociable, and statistically, get sick more often and die younger. If you are getting pet rats, you must get two of the same sex, ot find a pet that can live alone.<br>  <br>  Please do more research.

But anything a hamster or gerbil lived in is WAY too small for a rat. Tell her either make another pet choice or not to be cheap. An adult gerbil/hamster is very small as compared to a rat.

Do not use commercial flea treatments as they usually all contain chemical insecticieds that can cause liver damage to both you and your cat. Instead use Feline Target Spray for the fleas. I've used it and was able to rid my cat of the stupid fleas very quickly. You can actually spray the stuff onto the area where the fleas are on your cat. Here is where I bought it: <a href="http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-fleas-p68.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-fleas-p6...</a><br>  <br>  Cat fleas love a warm place to live and your cat is the perfect host. They feed on your cat's blood, weakening them. Cat fleas are disease-carrying organisms that can also trigger allergic reactions in your pet. They often affect weak animals and/or those in poor health. Fleas can transfer themselves from your pet to you or to another animal and can live for up to 30 days, the typical flea’s life cycle. Keeping your cat’s living space clean is an important part of prevention and reduction of cat flea infestation. Make sure to regularly vacuum and wash toys or blankets and cushions. Fleas harbor tapeworm eggs so getting rid of these pests will help to keep your cat safe and healthy. Target Spray is safe and easy to use as a preventative and treatment of cat fleas.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	No they don't work because they don't protect the entire body. They can cause skin irritation. Use a topical treatment like Frontline or Revolution.

(or something like). <br>  <br>  Dogs are very simple, they just want to please their master. Make sure that your dog recognizes you as "the master", be assertive with yesses and nos, when they do not listen let them know you are unhappy with them. Same with doing the right thing....lots of "good boys" and brisk rubs and treats<br>  <br>  Big dogs need big discipline early on. This does not mean beating your dog but you do need to physically assert yourself using the leash and your hands. When he acts up, be quick to grab him around his nose with one hand while looking him straight in the eye and tapping his nose with the other and saying "No". <br>  <br>  There is nothing more cruel in this world than someone who doesn't train and discipline their dog......trained dogs are much happier dogs and the animal shelters are full of dogs that people did not train and then couldn't live with anymore.|`|5766655cbe992f1606b9800dfdb5a865aa	well you can rubb his nose in it when he peas.

I don't have time right now to launch into a whole discussion of dog training, but I highly recommend the "Sources" books I've listed. Above all, train your dog to COME and LEAVE IT first. These are absolute lifesavers.<br>  <br>  By the way, do not EVER rub a dog's nose in his mess.

Gently pet her and praise her in a normal tone when she goes outide.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.

Rubbing her nose in poop can cause infections, especially if she has tapeworms or something like that. Just wipe up the spot and make sure (this is very important!) that you use a pet spot cleaner. You can buy the best stuff on the market at PetSmart or SuperPetz. A less effective brand (but it still works) is available at Wal-Mart. If you only wiped up the spot, your dog will go back to that spot and smell her "target", and decide that's where she's supposed to go next time. The cleaner removes all the doggy scent from your floors and furniture, so the puppy can't smell it, and therefore, it isn't a choice potty spot.<br>  <br>  If you must leave your dog alone during the day, you may want to crate train or paper train your dog, at least for a little while.

When I first got my Rotti-Shepard pup, I would take him out every 20 minutes. Most of the time, he wouldn't do anything, but it wasn't the point. It got him used to the idea that outside was where that happened. <br>  <br>  You also may need to get up during the night and take her out. My dog is 6 months old and now goes outside every two hours during the day and every four hours at night. He is housetrained, though, so I can tell you that this works.<br>  <br>  A puppy will need to relieve herself after playing, eating, sleeping or napping, or any other activity that takes her mind away from the task at hand. I would take my puppy out right after eating, drinking water, playing, sleeping, or just lying around. As soon as he would move, we would go outside. <br>  <br>  Limiting your dog's water intake is also a possibility. It may just be that she is drinking too much water and her body can't use it all. Dogs should be provided fresh water with every meal, after playtime and sleeping, except at night. That wouldn't be a good idea.

When I first got my Rotti-Shepard pup, I would take him out every 20 minutes. Most of the time, he wouldn't do anything, but it wasn't the point. It got him used to the idea that outside was where that happened. <br>  <br>  You also may need to get up during the night and take her out. My dog is 6 months old and now goes outside every two hours during the day and every four hours at night. He is housetrained, though, so I can tell you that this works.<br>  <br>  A puppy will need to relieve herself after playing, eating, sleeping or napping, or any other activity that takes her mind away from the task at hand. I would take my puppy out right after eating, drinking water, playing, sleeping, or just lying around. As soon as he would move, we would go outside. <br>  <br>  Limiting your dog's water intake is also a possibility. It may just be that she is drinking too much water and her body can't use it all. Dogs should be provided fresh water with every meal, after playtime and sleeping, except at night. That wouldn't be a good idea. You're dog will not die of thirst or anything like that by limiting water.|`|d3c00056c3dd71231fe980028cd18bdaaa	I've got 3 labs. and 1 lab mix (just in Labs) (9 dogs total)<br>       the best thing to do is to spend alot of time with them. I'll also tell you that i've used a corrective training (some call it a "shock) collar, it is not harmful, I train many dogs, and take in strays, train them and give them to good homes. I think dog training classes are rip offs. They do not teach you anything you cant teach yourself, or your dog. But some people use those classes as an excuse to spend with your dog. You must spend alot of time with a Lab. they require alot of attention during the first 2 years. another tip of advise, if you are not going to breed a Lab have him fixed. Labs are high stung dogs, and getting them fixed will mellow them out a bit, without changing thier personality.

Careful tho...(warning if you have never done this), some people will come out to your place and want to shoot the goat right then and there! I had someone ask me to do that and I about died (I refused the sale)! This is why all my buck kids were wethered (neutered) and sold to pet homes only.<br>  I'm not sure how old you are, but if you are younger..you should check into 4-H. Ours has a meat auction at the fair every year. The kids make pretty good money on them. They usually auction off Boer goats. <br>  If you are selling them as pets...between $25-$50<br>  If they are show goats, have papers and come from good champion lines, have near perfect conformation and high milk production...you can get much more. I use to raise, show and breed dairy goats (Nubians and Toggenburgs) and my one 3 yr doe sold for $2,000. Her doe kids sold between $200-$1,000.<br>  <br>  Milk...between $4-$10 per gallon, again, depending on where you are. You cannot legally sell unpasturized milk (although alot of people do) But pasturizing is easy..just heat it to 165 degrees for 15 seconds, then cool it.<br>  <br>  You could also get into making goat milk fudge, cheese, ice cream...those are really good!|`|5766655cbe992f1606b9800dfdb5a865aa	a duck $15 chicken 10 tiger 75 dwarf rabbits 35 gaot 50 bottle 2|`|825fa2d779c0c52177f11039c8217326aa	maybe: goat-$15 depends on condition or age!rabbit-$5 or less chicken-$8 or 9 duck-on baby $2.50 and up to 5...goat milk-$2.99 maybe!! this is what i think! hope this helps!!

This was the first time ever that this had been discovered, and it was somewhat recently. They blow air through their wind pipes and it makes a very very soft somewhat high pitched noise that only certain machines can pick up on. They seperated  a mom from her baby and recorded the noises she made to call out... when they mom started panicing.... the other giraffes that were out of sight came running across the pasture to her to see what was wrong and her baby made small noises too.

Los peces y peceras, naturalmente, se relacionan con la energía del Agua y aportan fluidez y tranquilidad.

Para dedetizar vc mesma, teria que comprar um "triatox" e diluir bem, se eu n?o me engano é 2ml por litro de agua... e jodar em tudo, sempre de cima pra baixo, ou seja come?ando do telhado, de bastante enfase aos muros que d?o pra rua, pois c?es de rua s?o os que mais "trazem" carrapatos.<br>  <br>  Para o animal um otimo remedio é o frontiline, é caro, mas n?o é tóxico como outros, é bom vc levar ao veterinario para que ele aplique.<br>  <br>  Depois de tudo isso, é bom deixa-lo usando uma coleira anti-carrapatos, eu n?o me lembro bem o nome agora, mas se eu n?o me engano é da bayer, ela dura uns5/6meses. <br>  <br>  :)<br>  Espero ter ajudado|`|EuRa0SQOaa	é o melhor é levar no veterinário, uma dica q te dou é aplicar um remédio q entre direto na corrente sanguínea, um bom seria Front-line, eu sempre passo na minha e da resultado, pq além de eliminar ele previne, aplico uma ampola na nuca dela à cada 3 meses....Foi o vet. dela q me indicou, o bom também seria uma detetiza??o na casa + acho q ? adiantaria pq como vc falou a casa é grande e tem arvores, ent?o o melhor é vc prevenir neles pq assim eles ficam imune aos carrapatos........<br>  Boa sorte com eles!!|`|WSfNWhzUaa	leve  seu cachorro num veterinario.....<br>  em aguma agropecuaria...deve ter alguma coisa para eliminar as pragas....|`|d22c910df58a7d9e3dfbd2bdc06b2143aa	Eu tenho cinco cadelas e elas tinham muitos garrapatos.Provéi a bisnaga, o Butox, as coleiras e no outro dia tudo de novo.Ai, comprei sabonete para matar pulgas e garrapatos, tirei com a unha (que nojo me dao) os garrapatos de dentro das orelhas delas e deixei o sabonete com espuma nelas.Isso por uma semana.No quintal que é muito grande e tem muita areia borrifei creolina, tb nos muros e na cal?ada.Acabei com esses bichos nojentos.Nao da para relaxar, tem que ser uma luta diaria.Sorte.|`|BeXzOvXUaa	Eu tive esse problema tb, tenho 3 poodles e a única coisa q conseguiu acabar com os carrapatos foram as coleiras, pet shop vendem,mesmo q eles entrem no pelo do animal os carrapatos  morrem, elas duram cerca de 3 meses, antes tentei de td só isso resolveu...boa sorte|`|KOPR6EK2aa	Carrapato na orelha é complicado mesmo, meus cachorros tinham esse problema meu pai aplicou Ivomek neles e foi ótimo já tem quatro meses e eles n?o pegaram mais carrapatos, mas fique atenta a dose, e Ivomec é um complexo de vitaminas o que pode engordar um pouco o animal, mas é muito bom.|`|j5I2GeEraa	é perigoso tentar retirar os carrapatos apenas puxando. Suas pin?as podem ficar grudadas na pele do c?o e produzir inflama??o. O melhor é levá-lo a um vet para que isso se proceda da forma correta. Se os carrapatos estivessem em locais que n?o dentro das orelhas, mas digamos, no pesco?o, você poderia molhar um algod?o no álcool e colocar sobre o carrapato, pois assim ele fica "bêbado" e vc consegue retirá-los facilmente. Quanto ao produto para protegê-lo de ataque destes bichos, as outras participantes já deram dicas corretas. Quanto ao ambiente onde os carrapatos moram, uma dica é passar água salgada. Os carrapatos desidratam e morrem. Mas creio que apenas isso n?o bastará e vc pode pedir a sugest?o tb do seu vet, pois podes usar algum produto que possa vir a intoxicar seu c?o, outros animais e até pessoas.<br>   Se retirar algum carrapato de seu c?o, queime o carrapato, isso é imprescindível.|`|rj3tHCZfaa	O meu também tava cheio de carrapatos. Se o seu cachorro é de porte pequeno (como o meu) use um remédio muito bom chamado REVOLUTION, custa em média R$ 30,00 e dura 02 meses. Se tiver um cachorro de porte grande use a coleira da BAYER, essa n?o sei o pre?o, mas dura uns seis meses.<br>  No quintal dissolva BUTOX na água conforme indicado e jogue nele todo, acho que vai te ajudar, pelo menos me ajudou...

Conocer el número de cachorros aproximado (por eco o por rx) es bueno para evitar complicaciones en el parto, ya que sabiendo cuántos esperamos podemos llamar o ir al veterinario si vemos que no han nacidos todos, jamás hay que dejar pasar más de una hora y media o dos entre cachorro y cachorro, si tarda para nacer hay que acudir urgente al vet.|`|gDGvGArVaa	SI ES UNA COCKER AMERICANA (QUE ES LA MAS CHIQUITA YDE TROMPA CORTA ,COMO LA DE LA DAMA Y EL VAGABUNDO)DE TRES A CINCO CACHORROS,SI ES UNA COCKER INGLES PUEDE TENER HASTA OCHO CACHORROS|`|550055232085745360f114907084d401aa	más o menos 5|`|GfdKNRfZaa	Primero tienes que asegurarte de tu perrita esta totalmente desarrollada ya que si no lo esta puede acurrir un accidente con los cachorros, generalmente la puedes cruzar a partir del tercer celo.

IrPSCYQ4aa	El pelo de los gatos no hace da?o, el mito del pelo proviene de un parásito que se llama Toxoplasma gondii, que puede ser transmitido al hombre por medio de las heces del gato, no del pelo. Cierto es que la infección de este parásito puede causar problemas reproductivos en las mujeres, pero esto es muy fácil de evitar, si no come carne cruda ni ratones, sino croquetas o alimento en lata, siguiendo las indicaciones del médico veterinario para desparasitar a tu mascota cada tres o cada seis meses y teniendo las medidas de higiene necesarias con el arenero removiendo las heces del gato con una palita diariamente. El pelo y la saliva del gato pueden causar alergia a algunas personas hipersensibles, pero esto también puede ocurrir con el polen o con el chocolate.|`|33019d4ad083c47f6377fee2f97fab60aa	no es recomendado a las mujeres embarasadas tener gatos|`|366c549faa6d33e7833a21b648ff171faa	Hola. Me gustaría matizar una cosa.<br>  <br>  Cuando hablamos de alergia al pelo del gato,  muchos se piensan que es el pelo el que dá alergia y no es así exactamente. Realmente a lo que se tiene alergia es a la saliva y no al pelo. ésto puede pasar con otros animales no solo con los gatos.<br>  <br>  Los gatos se lavan frecuentemente y eso hace que queden restos de saliva en el pelaje (lo que dá alergia a mucha gente). Hay veces que parece que tenemos menos alergia a unos gatos que a otros y eso es porque ese gato, se lava menos. Ni más ni menos.<br>  <br>  Y respecto a que si es da?ino, no es da?ino de por sí. Como han dicho por aquí algunas personas, si tragas gran cantidad te puede salir un quiste, pero para que eso sucediera, tendrías que tener al gato prácticamente en la boca las 24 horas. Aunque por supuesto no es lo mismo un quiste producido por pelos, que otro tipo de quistes mucho más peligrosos.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|44817fe6e52b978898a955272c7bb5c1aa	SIIIIIIII!!!!! yo soy alégica a los félidos y en especial a los de gato, No puedo ver un gato, aunque sea a tres metros, porque no termino de estornudar|`|56ea99245c5714dc1ddc1c7cdae153a9aa	si, hace da?o|`|7ba9b1ca562a0e7bc573816963cb32d9aa	si... <br>  te explico, a una persona alergica le produce da?o...<br>  <br>  Ademas... en el pelo del gato se deposita a traves de la lengua del mismo (cuando este se lava) un "parasito" que es muy da?ino para la mujer (solo se transmite si la persona toca al animal y no se lava las manos y come... -por ejemplo-) este germen se adientra en el organismo creando complicaciones en el ambarazo (malformaciones, perdidas) y hasta la perdida de fertilidad... la enfermedad se llama TOXOPLASMOSIS<br>  es decir... el problema no es el pelo...

nf5Bejavaa	We got pet insurance for our puppy and are very glad we did.  Allowed us to pursue medical attention our dog needed and we would not be able to afford.  We considered just putting money aside, but already are looking at reimbursement of an amount that would exceed what we would have placed in savings...  Be aware that pet insurance will often not cover a pre-existing condition, so if you already know you dog needs surgery than insurance might not help.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Because there are so very many exclusions in the insurance policies, I decided it made more sense to put some money aside each money to be used in case of emergencies.  That way it's there if I need it, and if I don't, I have my money and not an insurance company.|`|FNYEkyqLaa	First of all insurance is not a profit losing business.  You will not pay them $50 and they cover a $2200 vet bill.  There are two kinds of pet insurance.  One that is a co-pay, they cover just about everything but you have a large co-pay.  The other kind pays most of the bill but they don't cover a lot.  For most people pet insurance is a waste of money.  It works for some people that are on a fixed income and could not afford a large one time vet bill.|`|6jem21vhaa	I would only buy insurance if it cost less than the price of the dog.

hcWlQO6xaa	They can only eat in the water. So don't put ANY food on land. They can't swallow it. The only brand I have ever seen wal mart carry is Wardley and thats usually what I use because we don't have a local pet store. They also need other things in their diet too. Crickets, worms, fishies, greens.

Good Luck with your new friend!|`|eaP6U4y0aa	I used to work for PetSmart and have had plenty of my own turtles even hatching 14 wild eggs we found in my back yard when renovating.  Did you get him from a petstore if so he should already know hey that is food and even if it was a baby they learn fast.  They can smell the food so will nibble on it and then they are like 'hey that is good' and walah he is eating.  The brand i like to use is called...Remington i believe and most everybody carries this brand but make sure you don't over feed because if you overfeed extra food he doesn't eat will pollute his water.  And make it very smelly for you.  Give him enough that he can eat in about two minutes.  Does this help.|`|G86jIhsbaa	You need to eat some of the pellets first, and make sure that he sees you eating them, otherwise he'll have no idea how to eat.<br>  They also like worms, insects, & minnows.<br>  Don't forget the breath mints afterwards.|`|dmAiWie0aa	My 2 RES love rosy red minnows. You can buy these little fish and put them in the tank, but only a few at a time. Its so much fun watching them trying to catch the fish. Each fish is about 10-12 cents. My turtles prefer the Wardley brand of pellets. I've tried other brands like ReptoMin and they don't like it as much.

DxNGYrYLaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  It sounds like your mom's boyfriend's cat is feeling like there is an intruder in his territory.  Your cat is scared because she is in a new place.  To make the transition as stress free as possible, make sure your cat stays in your room separated from your mom's boyfriend's cat (with the door closed) with her own food, water, and litter box.  This is her safe place.  After a few days, have the cats switch places (ideally without them seeing each other) so that they can spend time in each other's territory alone, without feeling threatened.  They can spend the day sniffing the other cat's territory.  This should be done for a few days at least.  After a few days, you can open the door to your room just a crack so that your cat can see and sniff the other cat without anyone getting hurt.  Only open the door enough so that they can sniff nose to nose and no paws can enter the opening.  Let them sniff until they aren't interested in sniffing anymore.  If this goes well and there is no growling or hissing, after a few days of this, there can be supervised visits.  They should not be left alone together until they are getting along.  This process could take several weeks or even months but it is worth it to keep your cat happy during the transition to her new home and housemate.  Take your time introducing them, this is extremely important.  Good Luck.|`|5ymqyc4Jaa	Take 2 pieces of cloth and rub it on both cats, then let the opposite cat smell it while in different rooms so they can get use to the other cat's scent.  Also, you can sit in your room with your cat with the door closed and put the other cat on the outside of the door and let them sense each other through the crack under the door.  This worked for my older cat when we got a new kitten a few years ago.  Good luck!|`|505140aea912a6e24f367da2e55c634aaa	Bring your cat out to the other cat and stay with her and pet the other cat showing your cat that the other cat is nice too.|`|iBJe5j24aa	Try putting the cats food near where she pooped and away from it's litter. With the other cat's give them all some catnip with a scratching post, that might help them interact with each other a little more.
AA12167469	Sea monkeys are just brine shrimp...which live in salt water.

bufVggNLaa	if it is able to eat by itself it would probably eat things like grass or possibly grass and cattail roots. Some types of water plants found in ponds. Most likely though at that size it is still nursing from it's mother. It might also eat leaves from poplar or willow trees. I have never tried feeding one myself just know of their eating habits. I think the best thing to do though is make sure there is no adult in the area you found it even though you didn't see the parent it might have been around and just got spooked for some reason and the young one got left behind. The parent animal is always the best for raising young ones. I am thinking beaver will be quit difficult because eventually they will need trees to chew for food and to help keep their teeth wore down.|`|X5KTQJj6aa	Baby beavers drink their mom's milk or if they are a little older, they eat regurgitated food from its mom.  If you don't think it has a mom, you need to contact an animal rescue organization because it is illegal to keep wild animals as pets w/out a special license, and that would be the best thing to do for the animal because the organization would know how to care for it and release it back into the wild.

I breed Min Pins and I would say that if her nipples are sagging like you say, she is either going through a false pregnancy or she is pregnant. A vet check is a must at this point.<br>  <br>  A good weight for a Min Pin should be 10 pounds or less. The AKC standard for the Miniature Pinscher in no taller than 12 1/2 inches, a Miniature Pinscher that tall would weigh no more than 10-11 pounds. Anything over that would be overweight, anything taller than that would be over standard and shouldn't be bred for any reason. If you aren't breeding to improve the breed within the AKC standards, you shouldn't be breeding at all.<br>  <br>  Call your vet soon to make sure your Min Pin is of a healthy age to carry puppies. Try to figure out possible males that may have mated with youre female, if she mated to a male that is much larger than her you can cause major problems with pregnancy.|`|aacdcb0eec3c6f3880bdcddf8da5012aaa	nipples  won't  sag unless they  have been  or are  filling with milk (hopefully).

If we had bought our beagle from a breeder, she would have been 400 dollars.  So, there's your answer--- that's when normal people can afford a dog.  If you give it the mediocre food and keep it healthy, you won’t need to take it to the vet and spend a lot of money... of course you can’t forget the normal checkups.|`|268f343e1595efa3563450702f5cca7daa	ic|`|60e41e781e4fe0684fa8ca97041a0efeaa	i have 4 kids and two dogs and they love each other and my kids learn how to be gentel and share|`|vKu2XQ9Xaa	Did not catch the front end of this but with love and good care<br>  you will find a way to have the dog.Go to a shelter there are tons of cuties dieing to be adopted.
5ee828923160e00596a5dfc7521b736aaa	Ferrets are carnivores, but you can offer him fruit and veggies. They can be potty trained to go in a litter box. Yes, they like to chew on things and your dog might try to kill it because it is a rodent. If it hasn't been spayed or neutered have it done NOW! They have a wild smell about them and if they are not spay/neutered it gets really wicked smelling. There is ferret shampoo you can use on them and a deodorant that will help in between baths. They need to be played with daily or they can become biters. They tend to get cancer when they get older and can live to be about 6 or 7 years old. They are more active at night. Your best bet would be to find a book on Amazon or such about ferrets. I had one and love it to pieces.|`|u9LweEI2aa	Ferrets are very smart and need lots of attention to be happy.  One cautionary word -  Watch out for your bird.  Ferrets will kill birds and they have amazing abilities when it comes to getting at places you think are out of reach.  Your small dog will also probably have to adjust as ferrets can be very fierce and may be a torment to your old pet.  Their mode of attack includes a strategy in which they flatten themselves to the ground and charge their opponent with the intention of getting access to their soft belly!  Ferrets have a lot of personality and are good animals for traveling with.  The more time you spend with your ferret, the better.  Mine ride in the car, go on walks,  and even accompany me to classes. Some ferrets like water, others don't.  They all need weekly baths or they will stink. Try ferret bowling.  Mine love it.  Pick a room with a smooth, slick floor and curl the ferret up in your hand head and tail facing you, back to the opposite wall.  Gently bowl the ferret across the floor.  Mine chitter and run back to me asking for another ride!  Also, you can feed a ferret a high protein cat food and suppement their diet with an oil called ferretone.  Ferretone is expensive but you should supply it to help keep your pet's skin and fur  heathy.  You only need to give them a teaspoonfull or so every day.  They love it!  Don't give them too much or they will get the trots. Like dogs, ferrets learn their names and will respond to them.  They love the outdoors and will follow you if you call them.  I hope you have good luck with your new addition - I see potential for disaster if you don't have the time and energy a ferret takes.  On the other hand, your ferret may enrich your lives and be a source of joy and entertainment.|`|2hOLFZOzaa	ferrets will use a ltterbox like a cat. The ferret a friend has was kept in a long wooden cage with bars  on the sides so you could see him play. Soft material was in the bottom of the cage for his feet and a wheel to play on, as well as, a few toys.<br>  They like the sun, but do not let them lay indirect light for a long period of time. Dry cat food is alright for the ferrets as well as ferret food. Trim their claws they get quite long and sharp. They can be fun to play with like a cat with a weasel look.  Don't worry about your bird, they like mice. They can be trained to lay outside on a leash, so they get out of the cage. In the house they can crawl into small spaces, so keep a close eye on themif you let them run loose.|`|48550e828f8468617b0761ee0ef718d0aa	Ferrets can eat CAT FOOD. NOT the cat food with the meat. Plain hard cat food.They have a habit of nipping (play biting). It might hurt sometimes but when they know they are hurting you they will not nip hard or not at all. They need clean water every day. They also need exercise to. You could let them run around the house. Some ferrets like water and don't mind baths.  Some ferrets seem to prefer a shower.But Do not bathe your ferret too frequently. Ferrets should be bathed no more than once a month. Unless your ferret gets into something and a bath is the only way to get it clean. Over bathing will cause a ferret to over-secrete its natural oils and it will actually smell worse a few days after its bath. If they are litter trained they will go to the bathroom in the litter box. If Not in a corner in your house. Or in the corner of there cage. Yes they chew on things but they do not do a lot of damage. But they will did up and in things (such as under your bed or under doors to try to get under and in).NO THEY DON'T EAT BIRDS I THINK?|`|83ceef78dd3f7db0533f9b7801cf1a24aa	I have had ferrets for a long time..what we do is mix cat food with ferret food for them.  Also, for baths you can buy special ferret shampoo to use on them. If you cant find ferret shampoo Johnson & Johnson baby shampoo works great. Mine have never seemed to mind being given baths, we usually give them one once a week.  You can buy ferret litter boxes to put in their cages, which they will use to go to the bathroom.  Also, you should make sure they have a large cages, with more then one level so they can run around.  You should find an area in your house that you can safely let them run around in so they wont always be cooped up in their cages.|`|CIOazPgnaa	Cooked meat <br>  egg scraps <br>  Do not feed anything that contains bones<br>  <br>  these are good websites to check out!<br>  <a href="http://www.miamiferret.org/about.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.miamiferret.org/about.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www-personal.ksu.edu/~sprite/FFSTART.HTML" rel="nofollow">http://www-personal.ksu.edu/~sprite/FFST...</a>

krXQaZAfaa	Rabbits are not like cats or dogs. Many people get rabbits expecting them to be like a cuddly dog and are then disappointed when they discover the rabbit's true behavior. With a little understanding you can have a very rewarding relationship with your bunny. Much of what we understand about bunnies today was unknown not long ago, so there is a lot of misleading information to be found from research and listening to friends. Please take the time to learn current information. Rabbits are very intelligent and social creatures, they require attention from their care-givers, they require toys and playtime distractions to avert boredom, they need exercise, they need proper food, they need everything that any other member of your family would need. If you're not enjoying the companionship of your rabbit, it may be because you haven't gained his trust and/or you haven't let your rabbit be a rabbit. They are very loving animals but they each show it in their own way and it takes time and work in most cases. <br>  <br>   Rabbits should be housed indoors in appropriate accommodations, including a litter box. Outdoor hutches are essentially a cruel and miserable life for a rabbit - they get no contact from their humans, and their humans never learn how much personality and sociability their rabbit really has. They also need exercise and attention. If you just leave your bunny in a small cage all day long, you will have an unhappy and potentially unhealthy pet on your hands that won't bring you much joy. If you take proper care of your rabbit, you can look forward to years and years of joy and love from your companion. <br>  <br>  A rabbit is very easily litter-box trained and most are meticulous about only going in certain spots. There are some times when a rabbit will forget his litterbox training, which is very often a cry for help (he's trying to tell you he doesn't feel well, and wants to make sure you inspect his leavings to investigate why he's not feeling well). <br>  <br>   If you got a rabbit very young, you really really need to get it spayed or neutered when it's old enough, to prevent it from going through all of the hormonal ups and downs of adolescence. This will calm the bunny down considerably, and also make it much easier to get along with. It will also put an end to certain behaviors (such as courting, humping, mounting, spraying, and some of the aggresive behavior that go with hormonal floods). Females can become pregnant as young as 3 months of age, so you need to keep unaltered males and females separated until they can be spayed/neutered. <br>  <br>  Also, since unspayed female rabbits have better than an 80% chance to get reproductive cancer by age three, it is imperative that you spay her. Most rabbits surrendered to shelters are un-altered and the people were having behavioral problems with the rabbit, and simply didn't realize that if they had taken proper care of it, including spay/neuter, they would have had a wonderful loving companion and member of the family.<br>  <br>  Rabbits are delicate creatures, so please learn how to handle them. It also helps to understand what your bunny is trying to tell you. Rabbits have very delicate digestive systems and specific dietary requirements, so please read the section on feeding. They also have very specific health requirements (usually you need to find an exotic and/or small animal vet) and without proper medical care, some problems quickly become fatal. Your bunny will also need you to groom him from time to time, especially during molting, to prevent gastric hairballs.|`|OUq8Wi9saa	yes<br>  but when u buy a bunny, make sure it is a baby, that way it will grow up with u and b used 2 being held and stuff<br>  also, a note 2 ppl who think all rabbits r evil:<br>  its not rabbits in general<br>  maybe that rabbit was mistreated, dropped, under fed, or just has a personality problem<br>  also a good tip when buying ne small mammal:<br>  make sure the fur is really neat and shiny.<br>  (at least this is the case 4 hamster so...)<br>  if the fur is nice and neat and shiny, that means the rabbit is healthy<br>  if not, its a sick rabbit and unless u r planning on spending lots of time and money on the vet, dont buy it; itll pro'ly die ne way|`|AA10835780	It all depends on you, your preferences, your lifestyle etc. I like dogs best. They love you like anything and are loyal untill the end! Just Google Pet Rabbits and decide for yourself. Good Luck!|`|Bu2VTMD5aa	I believe that rabbits are excellents pets. My rabbits are sometimes called little dogs because i have trained all 6 of my rabbits to come and respond to their names. I like to think that rabbits are in a way a mix of cats and dogs. I know that a lot of people would disagree with me but it depends on what cats and dogs you know and what you personally think. As i am typing this i have one of my rabbits cuddling on my stomach. I say rabbits are the best. Also, my rabbits get along with my 3 pittbull dogs, and my best friend/neighbors dogs and cat. So they can get along with other pets. Some rabbits enjoy baths, all 6 of mine enjoy swimming. I guess it depends on the rabbits personality. Just look at a lot of rabbits and choose which one you think is best.|`|OqaLwPEaaa	Bunnies require just as much time as a dog or cat would beleive it or not. They are also very fragile. I would say that if you take the time to look out for them and research, they are easy to care for and great pets =). You should take a look at this site: www.rabbit.org|`|hcWlQO6xaa	It depends on what you consider a good pet. They are easy maintenance. when it comes to cleaning feeding and whatnot. My experience tells me, not all of them like to be handled. Look up the care needs and then go from there. We had some and they were great pets, until they escaped. (THEY DONT LIKE BEING BATHED) lol Good luck!

eaP6U4y0aa	I would watch them very closely my friend.  Male canaries will fight and with each other even to death over a female.  I have seen it as i work in a petstore.  Hopefully you won't have problems because you have two females unless one decides he wants both girls.  Yes you should give them extra lighting and nesting materials as well.  Do you know how to accomadate their nesting needs such as where they can make their nest? Just ask and i will be on the look out.|`|HvWwjnLFaa	give the same light as if they were out doors and you might have troubleon breeding them because they like their privcey just like people.|`|59fc31c767f767833ee425ac57c91ba9aa	It's even harder for them to "Mate" when they are in separate cages!|`|82cfabdff8d7a3ae072efa575343be69aa	When birds mate, it is best if they are alone. I am sure they will eventually get around to doing it with all 4 in there but male birds will also fight. It is best if you are wanting to breed to seperate them. Good luck|`|9ioBetteaa	Most likly the dominent male will kill off the other then mate with the female. You should choose a male that the female is bonded to the most, then breed them. I have had one of my birds seriously hurt by that.|`|AA10303580	They would mate IF you give them enough space for each other. Meaning.. there should be two baskets or nestbox and the cage should be big enough.|`|C9AN0zVOaa	Canaries are very territorial.  The males will fight with each other and the hens will fight with each other if they are in breeding condition.  They will fight even in a very large flight cage.  At best they will be stressed and expend more energy in fighting than in productive breeding.  It is best to separate the pairs.  Controlling the amount of light is extremely important to bring them to breeding readiness.  Light should be gradually increased not more than 1/2 hour per week.  When they reach 12 to 13 hours of light per day they will come into breeding condition.  A web site which might be of interest is www.petcraft.com or just do a google search for canary care and breeding.  Good luck.|`|zvqpye59aa	yes one day
PBjuqnpiaa	Ideally yes, getting them both done would be the best option.  Female rabbits suffer quite a lot from reproduction tract problems (such as uterine cancers and similar) so getting her spayed not only means you can keep them together but also it will help to keep her long term healthy.<br>  However your male may still be very interested in the mating side of things and male rabbits being usually quite interested in the girls would still try and mate her (males will try and do this even when a female isn't receptive and in season) so to stop her being hassled, and again for long term health benefits with him (again males can suffer from problems with their reproductive tract), he should be neutered.|`|9bmuj8qmaa	you could just spay the male and leave the doe.im preety sure they could live together.|`|MaYQWweqaa	Get them both done.|`|Phr8KhqDaa	well you deffinately need to spay the female, they get ovarian cancer if they are not bred for a time and the male will eventually lose interest in the female after she doesn't take for so long.|`|TUco8dDaaa	I would say seeing as the surgery to neuter a male is much easier and not so intense, especially for bunnies of that age.<br>  Neuter the male.<br>  <br>  It will be better in the long run, as well as safer for the health of the animal.<br>  Good Luck!|`|eaP6U4y0aa	hhmmmm...i would spay her but not sure what your male would do but i think if she was spayed he would loose interest|`|crJRSvinaa	Definitely get them both done but only with a good rabbit vet who knows what they are doing!!

Rxo8akhdaa	Did you want her bred?  The gestation period is 63 days.  She will have a temperature drop just befor whelping (24 hours) and be nesting.  At about 30 days you can tell if she is carring by standing her up on her hind legs and resting her front legs in your lap.  Run your hands down her sides and if they feal filled out at the flank she is probably pg.  A normaly healthy dog is tucked up in the flanks.<br>  Her nipples will turn pink in a few weeks and breasts develouping by the first month.  The last week you can feal the pups move around and she will be uncomfotable and want to lay around more.  Her eating habbits will change.  The first month she may alternate being ill and refuseing food with engorging on it.  Feed her vitamin supliments for dogs.  The last month she will eat loads of protien and you can give her extra cottage cheese and egg or chicken peices. Protien.  the last week they usually go into a fast or eat very little. Keep up her energy with offerings of sweet vanilla yogart. For calcium and blood sugar.  There is a harmone shot recomended for as soon as possible after she whelps.  Called a "clean out shot" to ensure no internal infections and to aid in dropping her milk.....|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Take her to the vet between the 26th and 35th day - he can palpate the abdomen to determine pregnancy.  Don't try this yourself because it requires both experience and a very gentle touch.  Excessive poking can damage the fetuses and cause a miscarriage.  Or you can take her for an ultrasound as early as the 18th day.|`|b807f13da6719d3e3a726d7eb53fb59daa	Your dog must breed to become pregnant and breeding doesn't usually occur until at least on the 10th day of her heat cycle.After the first breeding ,you would probably be safe to have her tested about two weeks after first breeding.Her gestation period will be anywhere between 56 to 63 days from breeding depending on litter size.|`|FhdyUQwGaa	dod you want her to be pregnant? I mean did you intentionally or accidently breed her? If so, you're going to need to wait until the puppies are developed enough to show up on an xray. THat'd be at about 5-6 weeks.

qrjjo7AJaa	I've been involved with dogs for over 30 years.<br>  <br>  I'm currently owned by a red merle aussie.  One of the highest energy dogs that I've ever owned.<br>  <br>  The trick is to find things that you can do where you get to stand and they get to run.  Playing frisbee, chasing a ball, etc. are all great.<br>  <br>  If you can't do things in an area where the dog is loose, you can still have them chase a ball down a long hall in your house.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing with exercise is keeping the dog fit and preventing the dog from becoming overweight.  The second issue is keeping them stimulated mentally.<br>  <br>  Typical saying for aussies, "If you don't find a job for them, they'll find one on their own."  THEIR job may not be one that you want.<br>  <br>  Have a great time.  They are easily trained and a lot of fun.|`|1wCmuIs0aa	maybe enough but they love exercise. they love hours of play.|`|4rKtEiUoaa	If you do this every day, it might be enough. Every dog has a specific energy level. Australian sheperds are very energetic though. If your dog doesn't seem anxious or excited all the time, then it is probably getting enough excersize. But if it is destructive or overly hyper then you should take it out more.|`|Y3ocbKOyaa	lot's|`|AHfXTIGyaa	Exercise with your Australian shepherd at least once a day.

Otherwise he barks and attacks my other dog and won't leave me alone.|`|zw4Yncf3aa	Depends on the dog.  I have a high drive labrador, and she needs to walk 3-5 miles a day or go for a run for atleast 30 minutes.  Otherwise she is restless and wants me to play with her ALL day.  I suspect an aussie is the same or more energetic.  It just depends if she seems restless and is getting into trouble.  If she is getting into trouble, she is probably bored and looking for something to do.<br>  <br>  I agree with the advice to find games where the dog runs and you stay put.  Fetch is great.  It's great to walk with your dog, but sometimes the dog has energy when you don't, so games like that are fun.<br>  <br>  My only other suggestion is training.  Training really tires a dog out.  Learning a new skill or command, and also working on the old ones are very challenging, fun, and drain energy.  Plus, an aussie is a smart dog that will love to train.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I find tug-of-war tires my dog out.  They have to use a lot of muscles.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	I have bred & rasied them for 13 yrs.

6FG0KuhOaa	While most legitimate animal rights organziations (such as the ASPCA) do not support de-barking, if it is performed by an expertly trained veterinarian, it is not necessarily a cruel procedure. I personally would never ever consider it though. NEVER. If you cannot stand barking, why would you get a dog? (Not referring to you personally, just people who consider de-barking). If done by the wrong person, de-barking can be cruel and painful for the dog because people seeking shortcuts (such as corrupt owners of puppy mills) will take de-barking into their own hands by ramming a metal pipe down the dog's throat to damage their vocal cords. (Learned about this from the ASPCA, who I am involved with.) This other website I found is pro-animal but tries to give an unbiased take on debarking.|`|02b8c567a5af62959d05cd811ac28cc9aa	I fostered a dog once who had been debarked by previous owners. She still barked, but the sound was more like a coughing than a bark.<br>  <br>  I don't know what it was like for her to recover from the procedure but I know that I was disgusted that it was done to her regardless. It was a surgery and therefore put her at risk, and for what? She didn't bark all that much anyway. I would never consider having it done to a dog myself.<br>  <br>  People who don't like the sound of barking and can't be bothered to use training and common sense to stop it (like letting their poor lonely, bored dogs come INSIDE with the familiy) shouldn't have dogs in the first place.|`|9QCCVgTSaa	Please dont de bark your dog. It is very cruel. How would you like not being able to speak properly? Although a dog barks alot, you should never force it to. Even a bark collar that slightly shocks, or sprays a dog is better. It the better route. Shocking your dog is a bit cruel too, but will not hurt it in any way.|`|AA10327148	I see a lot of de-barked dogs at dog shows, even though it is grounds for disqualification. Most of them are Shelties or Pomeranians. <br>  <br>  I immediately lose respect for the owner, as it shows laziness or ignorance or both. I sure wouldn't buy a puppy from a mom that had been debarked, as that would show me the pup would likely be hard to train.|`|7oBQY5d8aa	The debarking or vocal cordectomy procedure is a risky surgery with a low efficacy rate.  Surgical complications occur in over 50% or the cases and over 25% regain use of vocal cords.  By debarking your dog you are harming him more than protecting him.  Dogs often use vocalization to warn that they are going to attack.  At least with a warning the person has a chance and so does your dog.  Try using a citronella bark collar.  It releases a mist of non-toxic citronella in the air which may be offensive/annoying/scary and deter him from barking.  You can pick one up from most major pet stores or order one online.|`|euoyytlcaa	Try something a little more humane first.  My dogs barked all the time and it was really annoying.  If they heard any little noise, they'd go nuts.  So, I learned this trick on Oprah and it actually worked.  If you get a spray bottle with water and wait until when they bark and then spray them they learn pretty quickly not to do it in those situations.<br>  <br>  Try something like that first?|`|unsqqwRyaa	don't debark a dog. that's so cruel - its like taking your voice away and more than likely, they'll still bark. If your dogs don't bark much, then what is the problem and why are you even considering it? you can train your dogs not to bark, you don't need to demark them.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I would not debark my dogs.<br>  <br>  It is cruel..  most vets will not perform a debarking surgery, so its typically done by shoving something, like a steel pipe, down the dog's throat to damage the vocal cords.<br>  <br>  The only people I know who would want to debark a dog are millers who have a large number of dogs and want to keep them quiet.|`|0xJZJggVaa	If it's a choice between debarking and the dog being euthanized, it's a good idea.......provided it's done by a vet under anesthesia.<br>  <br>  Puppymillers and Backyard Breeders shove a steel pipe down the dog's throat to debark them by rupuring the vocal chords. That is inhumane. <br>  <br>  I have Bloodhounds and I love the noise.

They are brutally honest in laying out the facts about their breed and you can narrow down the field first by size and length of hair, etc.  Do you have children, that should be a major factor in what type of dog you might want to consider.<br>  Obedient and faithful - definitely a Labrador Retriever, but...it's a big dog that sheds A LOT and can be very energetic.

T7nn2mEPaa	Hi. <br>  As a dog trainer this is my favorite question to answer because it is so simple yet no one seems to realize to do this. <br>  <br>  Ok start off with a leash and a different word then what you have been repeating so that the dog knows this new word MEANS COME.<br>  <br>  Have your dog on a leash say his name and then your new word(well just say its come)<br>  <br>  Ne as enthusiastic as you can and when your dog comes to you give him lots of praise and a treat. <br>  If he won't come turn around and walk away. <br>  Try again... Antthime he comes praise and praise. <br>  Turn it into a game have some friends sit outside in a circle all with treats and each take turns calling the dog. <br>  MAKE SURE HE GETS TREATS EVERYSINGLE TIME. <br>  If you are worried about over feeding him cut his breakfeast in half and take the other half as treats. <br>  <br>  Keep practicing until he gets it 100 per cent on leash. Then do it off leash. And then off leash around other people...then around dogs and anything that could be a distraction. Be overjoyed everytime and give him treats each and every time you call him. <br>  <br>  This is the 1 command if no other your dog needs to know. <br>  <br>  Never ever scold a dog for coming and once the word is 100 percent try not to use it 2 much as you will need your dog to come immediately in an emergency. Instead just say his name...he will be used to coming anyway to that as he knows his name and his name preceeds a command witch eventually gets him a treat!<br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember no matter what your dog ever does wrong never ever call him then yell at him. <br>  If you are not happy with his behaviour walk up to him and say his name followed by a firm loud no. But if he comes to you after you call him it is too late to discipline him! <br>  |`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	Buy a really long lead then in short training sessions using food treats let him go a short distance to start with increassing the disstance as you go, call him if he comes to you treat him. If he doesn't pull the lead a bit then call him again till he comes and when he dose come to you treat him. After a few training sessions you should see some results work up to no lead still using treats ,eventually you should be able to back off the treats and his reward can be a bit pat and praise "Good Dog".|`|YnWwcUPTaa	Start with your dog on a leash let him wander the full length of a six foot leash call him if there isn't an immediate response start reeling him in and praise and treat a lot gradually move to 30 foot long line and repeat the exercise once he has it down 100% on his own then try it with all kinds of distraction still on long line.  First start with no distractions and gradually introduce distractions.  then when he has it 101% on long line with all sorts of distractions you can gradually start on short distances, no distractions off leash and so on the same as on a leash or long line.  Some dogs pick it up quickly some don't.  Work him several times a day including in the house in different rooms. keep lessons short 5 to 10 minute each session.<br>  <br>  Never call your dog after you've told it to stay otherwise he will never learn to stay for any length of time you must go back to him and praise and treat for staying,|`|D4RBT5kCaa	You should have used a different primary Question.<br>  I was a bout to refer you to a South Park episode. lol<br>  <br>  Walk over to him and grab his collar and walk him back to where you were repeating the word 'Come'.

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You absolutely do have to get her over her dog aggression before putting her in agility classes.  She won't be allowed to stay.<br>  <br>  It's really hard to answer this without knowing exactly how bad your dog is, what she does, why she's doing it, her history, etc.<br>  <br>  But, try this.  Go for a walk with a pocket full of treats she really likes.  When you see another dog approaching, before she growls or lunges or whatever it is she does, start giving her treats.  You also need to be 100% sure you're not tensing up, tightening the leash, or anything like that beccause your tension travels down the leash to your dog and she thinks she's right to be aggressive or afraid (whatever her problem is).<br>  <br>  Keep talking to her in an upbeat voice, give her lots and lots of treats.  If you're very consistent, pretty soon she's going to associate the appearance of another dog with her getting treats and she'll ignore the dog.  At some point, you have to slowly wean her off the treats (giving them only occasionally).  <br>  <br>  You might want to consider clicker training, depending on her temperament.<br>  <br>  An aggressive dog should absolutely never be off lead - she's likely not reliable on recall either.  You'll be in a world of trouble if your off-leash dog attacks another dog.|`|S4dxECPIaa	When you see another dog coming, put her on a sit stay and ask for her attention.  Give her a treat when she is looking at you.  Continue to ask for 'attention' and a sit stay until after the dog is past you.  If you can't get a sit stay and attention with the distraction of another dog, then start working on getting it in a non-distracting place like your living room, backyard, and then work up to more distractions.<br>  <br>  I'll also warn you that your dog may be kicked out of agility class if she shows aggression towards the other dogs.  I've trained a number of places with a number of dogs and every one of them had a 'no dog or people aggression' rule.|`|YVgu0aduaa	A lead with a choker type collar.

o5Nsqezoaa	Here's some ideas:<br>  <br>  1) You'd be saving and providing a better life.  <br>  <br>  Thousands of dogs in shelters are put down because they weren't claimed fast enough.  <br>  <a href="http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=now_drtv" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pag...</a><br>  <br>  2) The dog would bring lots of joy to your household.<br>  <br>  A cuddle buddy, a companion, a running buddy, a family member.   Those are just a few of the many positives of having a dog.<br>  <br>  3) You will become more responsible and will keep up with your commitments a whole lot more.<br>  <br>  Dogs are a huge responsibility.  With the consistency it'll take with the dog, big chores will seem like nothing and you'll have no problem doing them.<br>  <br>  4) The dog would most likely be trained and socialized already.<br>  <br>  5) The dog would most likely have their shots and neutering/spaying done already.<br>  <br>  6) The dog would be a good houseguard.<br>  <br>  During the night, if somebody that shouldn't is on your property, the dog would give a warning bark.  <br>  <br>  7) You'd be saving a lot of money.<br>  <br>  Like I said in reason #5, the dog would most likely already have their shots and neutering/spaying done.  So a yearly checkup would be all you'd need.  And, adopting is so much cheaper (and better) than buying from a breeder.  You could get one for less than $150 at a shelter, and on the other hand a breeder would sell it to you for $250-$500.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well that's all I can come with for now...|`|FEkpBdfaaa	1.

9yBC4UK5aa	hola...<br>  <br>  mira, es triste mirar en que condiciones se suelen tener a los betas, ya que muchos creen que solo por que los bettas pueden vivir sin oxigenacion del agua y  en un espacio del tama?o al que deja una pisada de un buey creen que solo por esto ellos tienen que vivir en un espeacios muy peque?os.<br>  <br>  los que son capaces de vivir en es tas condiciones y solo por necesidad son los bettas salvajes, los que han nacido en cautiverio son mas fragiles...<br>  <br>  debido al laberinto u órgano laberíntico, estos ejemplares (la familia Osphronemidae , al igual que Anabantidae y Helostomidae) pueden tomar aire de la superficie, de esta forma necesitan poco aporte de aire, por lo que un filtro y un termocalentador serán suficientes. Necesitan espacio... aunque se dice que son capaces de sobrevivir unos 2 meses en el espacio que deja la pisada de un buey, hay que constatar que esto sólo ocurre en la naturaleza, con ejemplares salvajes, los cuales están mucho mejor preparados para la subsistencia que los que podemos mantener en nuestros acuarios. Es muy importante recalcar que los ejemplares que solemos tener en nuestros acuarios necesitan todos los cuidados y todas las atenciones que cualquier otro pez, necesitan tener una temperatura constante y unas buenas condiciones de agua. <br>  <br>  A la hora de mantener Bettas, hay que tener en cuenta que son animales territoriales, por lo que tendremos que decidir como los vamos a mantener. Podemos optar por varias opciones: <br>  <br>  1. Acuario específico para un solo macho. Lo ideal sería tener un acuario de aproximadamente 20 litros. completamente decorado con filtro y calentador. <br>  <br>  2. Acuario especifico con hembras. Mínimo 40 litros, un macho y tres hembras, para evitar ataques entre los ejemplares. Es muy importante tener el acuario muy plantado, con muchos escondites, de tal forma que puedan encontrar rápidamente refugio en caso de necesitarlo. <br>  <br>  3. Acuarios comunitarios. En este caso también tenemos que tener mucho cuidado en elegir a los compa?eros del acuario y el tama?o del mismo, por ejemplo, en un acuario de 100 litros, se podría mantener un macho y tres hembras de bettas, junto con un trio de “gouramis perla”, mientras que si el acuario fuese de 60 litros no sería recomendable esta combinación. <br>  <br>  4. Betteras. Existen multitud de dise?os, no es lo más recomendable, pero son indispensables en la reproducción. <br>  <br>  <br>  suerte...|`|27e8fb840789dbb5d6ebe24ab8bba2ecaa	>> si eso es cierto yo te recomendaria k de ves en cuando le des de comer por si no lo haces<br>  <br>  y pongas su pecera 1/2 al sol todos los dias <br>  <br>  eso hace muy feliz al mio <br>  <br>  <br>  unete a mi y di cualkier tonteria =D<br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmxMDh_Q0jA9GM9n4q3pUo2Y8gt.?qid=20070626105537AAcR0ll">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	COMPRA OTRA PLANTA|`|FbPYDtC2aa	esta pasando por una etapa de deprecion por la soledad <br>  comprale compa?ero|`|ZeO5M91naa	el que puedan vivir sin aerear el agua no significa que vivan felices en una pecera chica como lo son esas de plantitas, los betta son peces de lagunitas, con muchas raices, es cierto, pero tienen mucho espacio. te recomendaria que lo cambiaras a una pecera un poco mas grande, con una planta peque?a, y que compraras alimento especial que biene en bolitas, pero es mejor un alimento epecial, son peque?os trozos de mozquitos. eso si lo nutre|`|twk7Cxq1aa	Pues mira, en primer lugar nunca de los nuncas los vayas a poner juntos.

In fact animals understand much more than you realise. You have to focus on your exams and your dog has the sense to give you the space you require.<br>  <br>  Continue spending quality, rather than quantity, time with him. Obviously you are stressed and your dog understands this. Give your young man a little more credit, since he so obviously respects you. Your body language is communicating with him and that is how he comprehends that you need 'time out'. Just give him a quality hug and he will be waiting for you when you have more time.<br>  <br>  Give him an extra treat. You're ok and your dog knows it.|`|0C40XV0Caa	It sounds like he sees you as a litter mate.  The Gardener probably has authority in his voice and the pup respects that his rank is below the Gardener's rank.  You need to show (in a kind humane way) that you out rank the pup.  He is young yet, so don't worry, but you really need to sign him up for puppy classes and you need to be the one to handle him in class.  They don't train your puppy for you, they teach you how to train your dog and it all starts with the rank thing.  Screaming or hitting DOES NOT work, it is all done with a firm voice for correction, a happy voice for praise and body language.  You puppy will love class because he has your attention, gets treats and lots of praise!  It is also a great way to get your puppy started on his socialization skills (another must for any dog that may ever come in contact with people and animals outside of your immediate family).  Good luck and enjoy your new puppy.|`|ZnMlgzF2aa	Better ask ur dog :P|`|fdiLsPCGaa	Of course he will like you, he might be more excited to see your gardener and your brothers friends because he doesnt see them as much as you, when he bites you and jumps at you he will probably be trying to get your attention, take a break from your exams and take him out for walks that he will look forward to|`|2lvpda2Kaa	dogs give back what they get - spend some time with him, playing ang TRAINING him - then he'll love you.|`|FCgtnZAXaa	spend a lot more time with him and he will come to listen|`|RATjzISvaa	You definately have a dominance issue here. You need to assert yourself. <br>  You CAN do some of it physically. You have a wrestling match. Hold a piece of food in ur hand (like a dog treat or something he'll find very tasty, like a dried piece of lambs heart) show it to him and let him have a lick. When he tries to get it. Push him away but keep offering it to him. When he begins to bite force him to lay on his side and pin him. After he settles a bit release him and begin again. When you get exhausted or have just had enough go and have something to eat while he watches. When you're done, take him away from the kitchen and dining area and feed him. <br>  Make sure he always eats at the same time and always AFTER you have and away from YOUR eating area. This will show him you're more important and he can't argue with that cos he can't open his own can of food can he?<br>  Teach him to sit. Again use the hidden treat trick. Raise your hand above his head and move it slowly toward his tail while saying SIT loudly in a firm commanding voice. Dogs can't look up all the way while standing so he'll be forced to sit to keep looking at where the food is. Once he is seated for a moment give him the treat and praise him with words and patting.<br>  To stop him jumping on people try this. Whenever you come home or whenever one of your regular visitors or family enter the property if he jumps on you then turn your back on him. Dogs hate being ignored and he'll learn that jumping on people means he gets ignored. Once he stops jumping on you pretend you have a treat by holding a closed fist and tell him to sit. If he does as you command then squat down to his eye level and give him heaps of praise. In time he'll learn to react in that manner automatically when visitors enter - to sit instead of jumping.|`|RJqCYYkYaa	He thinks he is dominant over you and dominant dogs don't fawn over submissives.

He's just young and impatient, they can be that way. I've had alot of puppies born in my house and I've taken care of most of them so I know that they get fascinated by new people and follow them and try to win their affection. With their master, they either become inseparable or start taking them for granted. you need to spend some more time with him and keep him close to you in order for him to get attached to you. Like when you are studying, you can keep him beside you and give him a chewy toy to keep him busy.<br>  Best of luck!|`|iC0TwjMRaa	i feel very sorry for your dog, puppies need a lot of time and attention and you should not have got him if you can not give him what he needs. if you want to bond with him take him for a big long walk hell love that exams are no excuse im sure you have a spare hour . maybe you should also buy a dog training book to learn how to be a pack leader|`|rybwRAXraa	Propose to ur dog|`|s5bbvhkkaa	He is just getting to his territorial stage.

5bn437a5aa	This might might work with her being scared.  Take her and put her under the covers (leave a lil light) with you right in physical contact so she can feel your vibrations, she is scared of the unknown and you do have to realize you are a BIG THING compared to her mom that she was taken away from, she needs to be comforted first and foremost. The other suggestions is try to keep her out of a kennel as much as possible, and walk her, and ease her into the new environment.  You cannot MAKE her eat when she is scared or timid, she needs to get comfortable First then she should slid into eating.|`|0o8jFoOTaa	She probably cant chew the food yet, even if its softened down.  It needs to be blended for a pup that young.  Take the amount of food the bag says she should eat in a day and divide that by 3, because you'll feed her 3 times a day.  Take that good quality puppy food and put it in a blender with a good quality puppy powder formula (not regular milk) and water.  Mix until its mush.  This is how she will eventually learn to eat the dry kibble.  You will gradually blend the mush less mushy and more thick as weeks go by.  After that you can begin to just wet down the kibble.  Even after doing this, my pups took a few feedings to get used to the wet down stuff.  The blended mush is the best way to go right now at her age.  Theres no need to bottle feed her anymore bc she has to learn to eat.  And as long as you are putting the puppy powder formula in her mush, she will get the nutrients she needs.  A pup that age is still peeing and pooping with her littermates whenever she wants.  So, its going to be challenging to get her potty trained this early.  I would just put down newspapers for now until she's old enough to go outside.  As far as her crate goes, she still wants to be with her other pups and mom.  So, make sure she is around you all the time when you are home.  Put a shirt of yours in the crate with her when she has to leave.  Im sure there are other suggestions already for what else to put in.  I never crated my dogs, so only know what Ive heard.  Good Luck.|`|2BvuT6Pmaa	hi. ok well she's still small so you might want to feed her with a bottle. The milk should be powder which you mix with water.

You shouldn't take a puppy away from the mom until around 8 weeks of age.  I know the idea of saving $50 dollars sounds good but if she dies, is it really worth it.  Don't rush into purchasing a dog. This is even more important if its your first dog.  Having a dog costs money.  I'm sure you know that. Shots, spay, neuter, food, toys, shoes. In our case, alot of shoes, and training.  Training is so important.  I'm in the process of spending $1500 on a dog that I have been doing research on for 2 months.  I know its alot of money but I'm buying from a reputable breeder, not a puppy mill, and I know I will be happy with him for the next 12 to 14 years.  He is exactly what I want.  This is a rare breed, not all dogs are this expensive.  Alot of people cant see spending that kind of  money on a pet.  The way I think about it is that people will spend $10,000 to $30,000 on a car plus gas and insurance over a 5 to 7 year period but won't spend a fraction of that on a good healthy pet.  Im not sure what you can do if she wont eat.  If it was me, I would take her to the vet and get information from him/her.|`|Pw5gZd4Jaa	you'll want to give your new puppy pet milk from the pet store and to put down pet pads to keep your floors from being <br>  ruined <br>  Here's what I found a <a href="http://www.Petsmart.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Petsmart.com</a><br>  Eukanuba Puppy Small Breed Formula Food  <br>        Pet Ag Goat's Milk <br>   <br>  Free* Shipping on orders $60 or more!**<br>  Our Price: $64.99 <br>  View optionsGoat's Milk by Pet Ag<br>   <br>  Free* Shipping on orders $60 or more!**<br>  Our Price: $6.99 <br>  View options|`|WGNomQEXaa	Woah. She might die. If she doesn't, she'll probably have emotional/behavioral problems. Probably health problems, too.<br>  <br>  50 dollars is not worth endangering the life of a dog by separating it from it's mother too early. If you can bring it back to the mom, do it. It's not worth the 50 bucks and it's cruelty. :(<br>  <br>  The mother's milk contains all of the immunities and nutrients the dog needs. With a milk replacement, the dog is still more likely to be weak and get sick a lot from different diseases as an adult.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Puppies need to be with their mother for 8 weeks. They shouldn't be entirely on dry food until 7 weeks, or so, depending on when the mother weans!<br>  <br>  Don't give cow's milk. It can kill a baby puppy with diarrea, because they can't digest it. You need to get puppy milk replacer. If your vet is not aware of the dog's age and the breeder isn't available for help, then contact the vet and let them know the exact situation. If the dog doesn't eat, it will become hypoglycemic. If you force it to eat, you may kill it.|`|XqfH76PMaa	You are doing right by putting the milk in with the dog food to make it soft.  You may have to buy a baby bottle and feed her off of it for another week or so if she doesn't start eating.  Right now she is very afraid and wants to know where her mommy is.  She is going to cry alot for awhile because she misses mommy and her brothers/sisters.  You really can't do anything to make her stop.  It should get better over the next week.  Just make sure and show her lots of love and attention and keep a close eye on her.  Make sure she eats and make sure it is puppy food (soft food mixed with milk is best).  Good luck with her!|`|8oDH5vv7aa	:/  Buying a dog so young to save money is really irresponsible.  Apart from her health that is now at risk, puppies gain a lot of valuable socialization from being with their mother and siblings until they are older.  It teaches them how to interact with other dogs, and sets a really good foundation.  Additionally, I really don't even want to think about what kind of a breeder it was that was even willing to sell a dog so young.<br>  <br>  You need to take her to the vet immediately and get schooled on the proper way to feed her.  (How often, what to feed her, etc.)  Cow's milk is not good for her, you need a puppy replacement milk.<br>  <br>  She will poo and pee frequently.  She should ideally do so after every time she eats/drinks.|`|GKQ7EAPlaa	ok seriously im telling you this...<br>  <br>  if you can take it back to its mum and tell them you will pick her back up when she is 8 weeks, she needs her mothers milk, not cows milk. <br>  dont put her in her cage, that makes her feel captive, and she wants to be with you, the closet thing to her mother.<br>  <br>  if you dont plan on taking her back to her mother then get a soft toy which is larger then her. (should be a puppet) and put a clock in it which makes a ticking sound every second. This ticking sound, will be representing the sound of the heart. and this will help her get to sleep very easily.<br>  to make her eat what you gave her, put that toy in which has the heart next to the food, and maybe that will get her to relise to eat.<br>  if that fails then put it in your hand and place it directly under her mouth. <br>  you might also want to go to the vets to get ideas, from proffesionals who would no better then whatever any of these other people are telling you.|`|GVdgZJZYaa	Wow! That is pretty sad that this pup was taken away from her mother when she was only a month old.  Usually puppies aren't put up for sale until they are at least 8 weeks because they are usually not feeding off their mother by then and have learned to poop and pee on their own as well.  <br>  <br>  Until you can contact a vet so you can get the proper info you need for your pup....just make sure your pup eats like every 2 hours or so preferably warm milk and you must make sure she is pooping and peeing after she eats because this pup is so young she might not be able to do so on her own just yet.  So if she isn't then just rub her tummy with a warm wash cloth until she does.  Also, make sure she is extra warm.  <br>  Because she is so young you have to take extra precautions becuase she is more vulnerable to getting sick or even death because she is without her mother at only 4 weeks so make sure you contact a vet asap to get her checked out.<br>  <br>  Goodluck! I hope all goes well for you and your pup.|`|MM1iKPtGaa	You're asking for sense, when YOU are the one that purposely bought a dog that was too young to leave its mother?

I thought (or hoped) that this might be one of the "crank" type of questions, meant to upset people, but I'm not sure.  My advice is to take her back to the person with the mother, & see if the mom will take her back. (I'm sure she will)  She is just too young to be away from Mom & sibs, & it could do a lot of psychological & physical damage to keep her during this critical time.  If you were knowledgeable about taking care of her, I might say you could try, but you don't know the first thing about it, you are surprised that she is crying alot,  you keep her in a cage, & you just don't seem to have a lot of common sense in this situation.  I'm not trying to lecture you, but you have a little life there, that you are completely responsible for.  A little life that should still be with her mom.  If you would let $50 (or any amount of money) come before her health & welfare, I just don't think you're ready for a dog.  I know this won't be a popular answer with you, but it's my honest opinion.  Good luck, you can always wait a couple of weeks & go back & get her!|`|DjjUe4MBaa	What kind of breeder sells puppies at a discount before they are ready to leave their mother? You may have saved $50 but you may end up paying more than that just in items to sustain her during the time that she's still supposed to be with her mother. <br>  <br>  Anyway since you've already got her try supplementing her with a bottle while still feeding her dry puppy food with milk smashed in it. Remember, this is a VERY difficult transition for her so keep her close to you as much as possible and don't leave her alone for long periods of time. You may need to sleep with her for a few weeks, not only so you'll get rest without hearing her cry all night, but also for the body warmth. Since she would otherwise still be with her mother and siblings she would have the close contact with them to keep her warm, and so you will have to supplement that as well. I wish you luck and many happy years of happiness with your new pup.|`|U0Tjzi1maa	well you're going to have to be really patient with her because of the huge age difference. right now that puppy is very upset. she just lost her mother and litter mates. my advice to you is to keep her with you in bed, don't crate her until she is familiar with her new home. going from one extreme to the other is too much for a new puppy to handle. crate her in a couple days, or at least tomorrow.. not tonight. as for the food, she is probably way to stressed out to eat, but she MUST eat within 12hrs or she could get hypoglycemic. making the dog food soft with milk is good but i suggest you buy puppy formula and don't use cow's milk.. if you can't.. then use Goats milk instead. and make sure the dog food kibbles are high quality in nutrients.. the dog really needs a lot of help from you since it's so young.. buy the best you can to aid in her growth. check this site for good brands <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  when you do decide to put your dog in the crate, give her a hot water bottle wrapped in a blanket to lean on. and put a ticking clock in the room to mimic her mother's heart beat. don't expect to get her potty trained for months and months to come. she should not go outside at this age, you should buy pee-pads, or just clean up the messes...<br>  you may have saved 50 bucks while buying her, but you are going to spend more than that now cuz she is too young...<br>  goodluck and best wishes.. puppies are a lot to handle.|`|ZZuNzLR2aa	No way should you have bought a dog, if you didn't know how to look after it!

There's something wrong if your dog does. Halitosis is often caused by bad nutrition (what does your dog eat?).

It can also be a sign of some pretty dangerous conditions such as lung cancer or kidney disease. <br>  <br>  First things first. Figure out why you pup's breath smells. If it's because your dog is eating a low quality food - it can be fixed by a foood change or maybe some supplemements. If it's an oral care problem starting to brush NOW probably isn't going to help. You're dog will need a professional cleaning (THEN you start brushing with a pet safe toothpaste to keep the build up from reoccuring) A trip to the vet is advisable. <br>  <br>  And to answer your question - you should never use human toothpaste on your pup.

Furthermore, human toothpaste froths up - pet tooth paste does not.  Therefore when brushing ur dog with human toothpaste it will get frothier and everywhere, a much harder mess to clean than just using pet toothpaste.
cPSuCPQuaa	Wipe his mouth out with a wet wash cloth and offer him water.  Pets salivate for several reasons.  It could be due to something bad tasting, dehydration, smelling food/excitability or something toxic. <br>  <br>  Toads can excrete a fluid that acts as a self defense against any predators.

Repeat several times.<br>  Most toads cause such a reaction, but usually it's just iritation.<br>  Watch and monitor your dog "just in case"<br>  This happens very often.|`|yfv3P996aa	He should be fine unless you are in Australia. If you are in Australia get him to the vet. They have dangerous toads there. In the USA they will foam at the mouth but should be ok. Toads  are not dangerous here that I am aware of. Give him some thing to drink and watch him. Good luck|`|zituIhQ2aa	he will be fine.... our dogs catch toads all the time and do the same thing for a bit afterwards...no big deal|`|PimB8Yhwaa	It's probably just grossed out, my dog did the same thing when it ate a stink bug.|`|WMi2WyjRaa	I had a dog do that one time and the vet told me that toads have a slime on them that they can you as a defensive mechinism. My dog just licked it and got a little sick, but your dog should still be okay. The slime is used just to make the toad undesirable to predators.|`|XL6gJjOGaa	dude call a vet.|`|aBNeBJb8aa	CALL THE  VET ASAP    and also...  <br>  <br>  GET THE REMAINS OF THE TOAD IMMEDIATELY ( if poss)  the vet will need 2 kno what kind of toad it is<br>  <br>  FLUSH THE DOGS MOUTH OUT WITH WATER  AND A  SOFT DAMP CLOTH<br>  <br>  TRY NOT TO PANIC   KEEP THEM AT EASE    AND SPEAK WITH A VET ASAP|`|jUsaNQEDaa	Call a vet! Some toads excrete toxins through their skin, you need to speak to a vetrinarian and take their advice. DO IT NOW!!|`|laaGi3Cvaa	Call your vet or any emergency vet that is open.  Can you put the toad in a jar to take along so the vet can see what kind it was?  Do this now,  Some toads can be toxic to dogs.

g9AWK7qcaa	I have an unpapered female doxie and I have had little trouble with her.  I saw both of her parents and they looked fine. <br>  <br>  Papers do not mean a thing unless you plan to show. <br>  <br>  Doxies make great lap dogs as they are always loving and very affectionate, they were originally bred to hunt hadger, thery have short legs to fit in the burrows,<br>  <br>  most doxies like to sleep burried in the covers, mine prefers my bed right between my legs.<br>  <br>  So, Don't worry about papers, unless you want to show, who cares.|`|z4ktz1h9aa	A wouldn't trust a breeder who breeds unregistered dogs.  If they don't bother breeding dogs that are registered, then I bet that they don't do any health testing (not vet checks!) either... buying from a breeding who does testing can save you THOUSANDS in vet  bills over the lifetime of the dog.  A registered puppy might cost you more now, but you'll save a lot of money later.|`|436460481b75b7b08996a2d69192387caa	Why would you need the papers for? I have 2 mini dachshunds, none of them has papers and one is a rescue. The important thing here is that this dog will love you forever. All dogs are awesome but dachshunds are dachshunds and they're very special in my opinion. I'm sorry, I don't even understand your question. I would never care if a dog had papers, I would even pick up a dachshund (or any other dog even a mutt) from the side of the road no question about it.<br>  All you need is their vaccinations and medical records, and if they don't have them make sure you take him to the vet right away to get the proof of it.<br>  And a little advice, if you really want to make the difference in your dog's life ADOPT instead of buying. I wouldn't trust any breeder, they just do it for the money, try and search for a dachshund rescue in your area, you'll find great deals (vaccinations, spayed/neutered, fully vetted and even microchipped) for a very low adoption fee.<br>  Good luck! (you'll never have another breed after you're owned by a dachshund)|`|1K8aTvtJaa	I have had many dachshunds... one of mine is lying next to me on the couch right now. They are wonderful pets and four legged members of the family. I grew up with at leat 17 dogs at any one time. Some had papers and some didn't. Papers don't make a difference at all! As long as the vet has checked them out, the parents are healthy and personalities are good, and the pups have been taken care of and it is not a puppy mill... then you've basically got all the info you need although you may want to ask for references from past puppies.  Other than that may I just say that you are about to enjoy one of the best breeds out there. Have fun with your new puppy!<br>  P.S. ask about the back/disc health or problems of the dachshunds... back problems are common in dachshunds but you should know if there has been any serious issues with it (one of my doxies had to have 2 surgeries... but she's 15 now and couldn't be happier)|`|5d3f182104724b7baf14bb889af076b3aa	If you are not breeding it than why spend the money on papers. A dog with papers will cost a lot more then a dog without.  If you find a puppy and it looks like a dachshund  does it really matter if it might be a crossbreed?  As long as you find a dog that you fall in love with it really does not matter if it has papers unless you want to breed it. Enjoy your new addition when you get it.|`|f15ccc60382cc366b7f41c8cf89cab64aa	hello there im very happy for you as your decision for getting it is a great one and can turn your life towards ultimate joy ok now for the papers.. i dont think that is a necessity as long as you are not planing on going for shows with the dog but make sure of the puppies temperment before you get it ok let me give you the rules:<br>  Rule 1: You should not have to put any effort in turning it <br>               upside down and then touching it exposed belly.<br>  Rule  2: If you hold the tail it should not turn around and bite  <br>                you.<br>  Rule  3:If you hold all it four legs on the ground it should not try <br>               to struggle out.<br>  Rule  4:Check for any ailments like discharges and even   <br>                lameness ,etc <br>  k thats it you got yourself a real good houseold pet now onething from the heart ,"THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PETS THAT ARE BEING ABANDONED AND ARE HOMELESS SO PLEASE THINK OF AN ADOPTION BEFORE BUYING A PET DOG ITS NOT A COMMODITY THAT YOU WANT FIRSTHAND ONLY"<br>   thats it have fun bye tc|`|poqQ4HLZaa	plz get papers<br>  when u take paper u r sure ... tht it is from correct source<br>  <br>  unauthorized breeders make thir dog a production house and tht results in degraded puppies<br>  <br>  while if you pay enough to someone whoz giving u papers, u know . about history of your dog and you get to see behaviour of parents to understand if your dog will be of good temprament or no.<br>  <br>  btw : my personal preference is Labrador retriever, they r best dogs as family member

That doesn't look no where near a Bulldog.|`|AA10756938	Unfortunately, he isn't 100% american pitbull, you need to trace who sold you to find out who are his parents|`|jXlVdPfdaa	This is just a guess, but to me he looks like he may be part bulldog but also part lab and border collie too!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|RZJqoVWZaa	The face looks like a Lab, but the rest of the body looks maybe bulldog with some bordercollie in there.|`|X29jLgrgaa	someone that I know has a puppy that looks just like this and it's 1/2 am. bulldog and 1/2 beagle|`|6zEcpaS5aa	American Bulldog Lab mix

VOGX6orvaa	No because shibas are already a small version of the husky. If you go to someone who breeds them and pick the runt, they will  be significantly smaller than they are supposed to be though. Like i picked the runt out of a litter of blue heelers and he is 10 lbs lighter and a couple inches shorter than the rest|`|M3xICUb6aa	Dogs are susceptible to dwarfism, but that is rare.

oZWD5Xh6aa	NO IAMS!!!!!! NO NO NO!!!!!!  It has filler.  Very poor, uninformed decisions I am seeing on here.  The food you were giving (Canidae) was more healthy than Iams.  We have our dogs on EVO and it is the best so far.  Below is the link, please check it out for your dogs' health.  It is more expensive than the others, but it is the equivalent of eating a balanced diet (EVO) vs. fast food (Iams) in humans.  Your pet will have a very nice healthy coat, and will be overall, a LOT more healthy.|`|FgbBCIKXaa	You dont have to do raw food, you can cook the meat and it would still be better for them than the processed and chemical-packed crap that you get in a store. No offence to you of course, that canned stuff is just really bad. A lot of the meat isnt checked, remember a few months ago when a ton of the dog food imported from China was toxic and many of the dogs who ate it got sick or died? Iams was on the list. Dogs dont need that junk in their systems, give them real meat if you can afford it.|`|ccadb36353769026fb7b05fe573fecd5aa	My bunch is very picky about their food. They will eat most anything the first bite, but getting them to go back is a chore. So far, I've found that they will eat Beneful and it's reportedly very good for them. The Science Diet, Iams, and Purina O.N.E. are also very good nutritionally, and they will eat these for a while, but if I buy a big bag of any of these, they'll stop eating it. Bil Jac is very good, but it has to be kept frozen at home, since it's basically ground raw (or maybe partly cooked) meats. In my opinion, most quality brands are good, I would just stay away from store brands (including WalMart's and K-Mart's brands) and the bargain brands in the grocery store. And, if you want to go for the fancy little cans, Caesar's and similar brands are good, but if you want all meat, no cereals or additives, at a lower price than these fancy treats, get Armour's Vienna Sausages, preferably the chicken variety, at about $0.50/can. The dogs love them, they are nutritional, and they are cheaper than the fancy canned dog foods. And you know nobody is cutting corners making them because they are intended for people.|`|PpiZXanSaa	Dont feed em' and let em' die..jk...iams, purena and ol' roy|`|YzNPbutVaa	eagle pack.....well that's what my dog eats.....|`|W0ZQQK4taa	Solid Gold<br>  Wellness<br>  Wellness CORE<br>  Eagle Pack HOLISTIC<br>  Merrick<br>  Ivonna<br>  Evo<br>  Orijen<br>  Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Evo, Orijen, Taste of the Wild, Eagle Pack Holistic,  Wellness Core, Nature's Variety Instinct--all are grain-free, high protein, good ingredients.

Freeze it in sandwich bags and pull it out as necessary-you'll have the healthiest Afghan within a hundred mile circle. Mix it with a little rice to stretch it out- also dirt cheap. Look at the cost of canned dog food and realize that it is nearly as costly as people food and made mostly from cow entrails (what else are they gonna do with all those kidneys and hearts and intestines?) and grain-yuck.|`|TldYGEwuaa	Have you tried Wellness?

lTsDwY9Paa	The baby might have simply scared the dog while he was asleep by being so close to him. My smaller dog has never bitten me or been aggressive towards anything except rabbits and birds and one day I laid down beside her while she was asleep and scared her and she jumped up and bit my face. I've done the same thing since and she's never done it again so its possible that the baby just startled him. Its best to keep the baby off the dog while he's asleep though.|`|MuD5oXQQaa	It's not vicious.  You can't let a baby crawl on a dog unless the dog has proven that he is okay with that.

iVQULHqYaa	I have had dogs for over forty years and I have never cleaned their teeth. I visit the vets if they have a problem, however none of the problems have ever been dental related.Way back I had Great Danes, now I favour German Shepherds. Two of my Great Danes lived until they were twelve years and I have had GSD's who lived until they were aged fourteen.<br>  <br>  Sadly some of my GSD's died when they were much younger, however having the pleasure of owning sixteen dogs throughout the years, none of them have had dental problems.All of my dogs have chewed carrots every day and on the odd occasion I give them raw bones. <br>  I am not a lazy dog owner, they are given regular exercise, groomed every day and they are never left alone for more than two hours. My dogs sleep in my bedroom on thick duvets and I adore them. Nevertheless I think that if they are provided with crunch there teeth will be OK. Please do not give your dog the so called treats from the pet shop as they can cause problems. <br>  For training treats I use hard boiled eggs, cheese, cooked chicken or dried liver. If dogs are fed rubbish they will develop dental problems.<br>  Edit. Ignore the stuff about raw hide chews they are lethal. Dogs can choke if they eat them and they do nowt for their teeth.|`|ErjSVRkqaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I brush my dogs teeth with a toothbrush and special dog toothpaste. Dont use human toothpaste but you can use your old toothbrush if you'd like. But, usually the dog toothbrush and toothpaste come together.<br>  <br>  Sure, in the wild they dont have a toothbrush. They do have bones to chew on which helps clean their teeth. But, once your dog gets older if you dont brush their teeth...they can loose them. Then, its harder for them to eat...resulting in an earlier death and pain. Dogs have been domesticated for years and when dogs and humans live together....it changes both of their lives for the better.|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Yes you are right, in the wild they do not have either, but our dogs have been domesticated for a while now!<br>  <br>  I feel both are useful. If you have a hard time brushing your dogs teeth, then dental bones are great.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	in the wild they would be chewing bones from killed animals..<br>  <br>  DOGS have been domesticated for years... <br>  <br>  <br>  i use a tooth scaler when needed.. not a big deal|`|lSiGnVDMaa	You can give you dog dental chews it won,t hurt him/her. But there is no need to brush their teeth , a dogs teeth are specially adapted to clean themselves there is a chemical in their teeth that kills plaque, Also chew toys and sticks get rid of alot of bacteria . Its a waste of time brushing thir teeth also it shouldn,t be done because It can distress the dog and cause it to bite.|`|sp9IaiDfaa	Some people do, while some don't. i personally dont think its nessecary, while some people do. dogs teeth are natuarally clean by chewing on dogs bones. they dont need their teeth to be brushed. some people just do it to help with bad breath. i agree with you, if dogs used to never do it, they dont need to start now. i would say jsut give your dog many bones to chew on, and they will be squeaky clean good luck|`|AA10851621	 That would depend. Have you looked at his teeth? Some dogs don't have a problem with Tarter buildup, If your dog is a toy breed then I would definitely start brushing them.|`|DhtxV686aa	ultimately, tooth brushes work better and faster,<br>  but dental sticks work well also.  |`|ACXO5Jloaa	I think we should brush their teeth and give them<br>  dental sticks :)|`|RCX7aQWdaa	no you do not but giving them bones makes there teeth stronger and no matter how yellow they are fine |`|7VleAyiIaa	I think they should have dental sticks. Especially mint flavored ones cuz they freshen ur dogs breath!|`|G6w8Kym4aa	Well i brush my dogs teeth but its not a BIG deal!|`|4MKRVOtWaa	Most people in our generation feel that we have to treat a dog like a human. I love dogs with all my heart and know so much about them. As long as you are feeding your dog dry dog food, as in the kibble, your dog should be fine. Dry dog food naturally brushes their teeth. Giving a dog canned food only rottens their teeth extremely fast. You can give your dog a little bit of canned food as a treat mixed with with the dry food but on a regular basis. You can also give your dog rawhide bones so they can chew to clean the teeth but not too many. Raw hides are used as a treat but not given too often because it takes a bit longer to digest in their tummys. So if you have a puppy, always start off with dry dog food. If you have an older dog then keep it on dry dog food. If your dog has dirty teeth then you have to take it to a dentist and have a cleaning done which can be pretty pricey to avoid that try and keep them on dry dog food. Picking out the right dog food is also tricky just look at the ingredients look at the Label and avoid any food that has any kind of corn, flour, animal byproduct or soybean in the four main ingredients. I wish you luck :)|`|Aq7A3EwAaa	I have never brushed any of my dogs teeth, either bones or preferably rawhide chews will clean their teeth perfectly. Vets have commented on how good their teeth have been and they have all had rawhide chews, which of course being non fattening they can eat as many as they want. Perfect for treats.|`|AA10720479	Yes, dogs get pain full dental diseases if there teeth are not clean. If they were in the wild they would chew on bones from dead animals. My dogs teeth stay clean with raw hides, I used to brush them a long time ago, but I think bones, and raw hides do a better job.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, i clean both my dogs teeth,they won't eat bones.i use a dog tooth brush.and dog tooth paste.don't use humans tooth paste,its dangerous.
eX8RLIqLaa	Cycling is only for filtered tanks. And make sure to put water conditioner in the water and let it get to room temp before putting your fish in.|`|rYf70iq5aa	Cycling just refers to getting beneficial bacteria established on your filters.  If you don't have any filters, then don't worry about it.  Just make sure you buy some water preparation chemicals for your fish.  Don't just dump it in raw tap water.<br>  <br>  I have had my betta in a small critter keeper (about 1/4 gallon) with no filter an no heater for over two years.  Just vacuum out poop and do water changes regularly.|`|WsvsJuoAaa	No, he won't be fine without a heater or a filter. It's winter time now, depending on where you are in the world, and he needs a heater, no matter the temperature of your house, or outside. Keep him in a tank that is 5 gallons or more, 2.5 gallons at MINIMUM. If you do not get a filter, your Betta will most likely die of ammonia burns, AKA, swimming and living in its own waste.<br>  <br>  You should put water out tonight, GET A FILTER, or else it will not be cycled. You need to put a few drops of the bottled stuff from the pet store - it's expensive, but it speeds up the process of cycling. Cycling the tank means that all of the cycles, AKA nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, and the pH are perfect. Upon getting your fish, you should get test strips from the pet store, and test your water. If your water does not display as okay for your fish, you should not get him.<br>  <br>  If you do not get a filter, you're setting yourself up for cleaning the tank every two days. Nobody wants to do this, especially with school, work, and other things in life. Save up $20, and get a filter. As well as a heater! If you do not get a heater, your Betta will get cold, and mostly just sit on the bottom of the tank. If you want him to live a much longer, and happier life, invest a small amount of money in getting a heater and filter.|`|pyFooAy6aa	You should get at least a heater first.  It's irresponsible not to spend the 5-10 bucks to keep your fish healthy.<br>  <br>  www.firsttankguide.net has info on cycling.<br>  <br>  I doubt you can do it in your tank/bowl/whatever though.|`|AA10720479	I have 2 Bettas, and have had them for a year, and had several befor. I keep them in  small tanks, no filter or heater. I clean tanks once a week. |`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	I have a Betta in a dish that I have had for 4 years, no heater, just use chlorine out,change the water and feed them.....
3eWD1EX6aa	A dwarf seahorse(Hippocampus zosterae) and a pygmy seahorse(Hippocampus bargibanti) are about the same size. However, pygmy seahorses come in colours like grey, purple, pink, yellow... and have these nodules that grow out of their skin. They're fascinating :] Dwarf seahorses, on the other hand, come mostly in browns and whites, and don't have any funny-looking stuff protruding from their skin.
1c4024e3b217f858e49bf522d7f35a41aa	Where will you be keeping said Turtle? If its small now and your going to keep it in a tank please keep in mind that they will get bigger. <br>  <br>  Turtles carry a variety of bacteria that can be harmful to your cat. Your cat might bat at it in the water, then lick its paw. Plus anything with a mouth can bite. Turtles can do some serious damage with the beak like mouth of theirs. The small mouth might be nothing now, but if it learns to use its mouth to keep thing away, forget about trying to be able to pick it up in the future.<br>  <br>  I suggest you have it located in a place, or enclosure that the cat cannot reach, and research how big this turtle will get.<br>  <br>  If you plan on keeping it outside, many other animals but your cat will try to eat it...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|o6yzFJgmaa	Pro ... Your cat may not kill it! it may just play with it<br>  Con.. If you r cat kills it .. you'll have turtle soup|`|Fu7OK54kaa	If it really wanted to, yes, or it would play.<br>  <br>  You can get the turtle, just keep an eye on them when it's by itself or in an open area, otherwise the cat can't get it|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	Keep them seperate.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	yes, turtles have shells, but cats have paws and claws. <br>  i doubt a cat would attack it, it doesnt move fast enough to be interesting, but if it wanted to, im sure it could kill it.|`|BDAzfBYEaa	If you get a turtle keep it in an enclosed room that the cat cannot go in because yes the cat will kill the turtle either on accident or on purpose. Good luck : ]|`|uJyNV25Eaa	you cat would have a go at anything that moves shell or not to be honest the cat would have it killed in seconds im afraid.|`|voYyWgb9aa	Keep it away from the cat :D?<br>  --<br>  <br>

40pyDwTGaa	Clip the hair around her butt.  Is she constipated?  Does she drink enough water?  What do you feed?<br>  <br>  Does she have a problem with her anal glands?  That means a trip to the vet to check it out!  She may need to have her glands "expressed".<br>  <br>  I have a corgi, her butt is "fluffy" and she gets fecal matter stuck in her fur.  She hates to have her butt cleaned, but I check it daily especially when she is sheding heavy.|`|AA10720479	It's just like a baby who doesn't get their diaper changed enough. It will pass(iritaion). I always use bag balm on irritated areas. Works well|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Same thing happened to me. Used moisturizing cream and it cleared up right away. Don't know if you can use same cream on dogs tho.<br>  <br>  Vet check|`|zr10Hvtbaa	she ate something she wasnt supposed to. are you giving her those rawhide dog bones? they are not good and can constipate a dog. i would take her to the vet because of the red swollen anus. also in the meantime give her a piece of bread soaked with a tablesppon of olive oil. this will help her to pass anything that is left. id make an appointment at your vets first thing tomorrow morning. she will probably need antibiotics to keep infection away.|`|66z7X7Vtaa	Use a shaver and shave around the butt and have someone hold her down while you do this. The poop is stuck by the hair, thats how my dog was. What i did was take my dog to the vet and they shaved around it for him. Try it, they also get of the extra poopie like they did for my small dog. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|vDCWkqheaa	Just try and make it better she just might have gotten the poop stuck to her butt.  Maybe she has done this before.  Rub some cream on the spot and just watch it over the next few days.  If it gets worse, like turns black, then go to the doc.|`|rOAwZq7raa	Perhaps take her to the vet, and see what the vet has to say about it.  You could also just wait about a day or so and see if the swelling goes down.  Good luck!|`|R0q4pGOPaa	There is no exact cause. I would have to see her in order to tell. she might have worms. Id take her to the veterinarian incase its internal. SHes not pregnent is she? <br>  <br>  hope that helped<br>  kate
t2M1kXY4aa	Yes, it's fine.<br>  <br>  Rats do best when kept in same-sex pairs.  <br>  <br>  They do enjoy the company of other rats, so keeping 2 together makes sense.  You don't want to mix the sexes unless you want LOTS of baby rats!<br>  <br>  A pet rat kept alone is not the best idea ... it becomes territorial and anti-social, and potentially aggressive.<br>  <br>  Adopting two of the same sex is absolutely the right thing to do.|`|LW9CxiCfaa	yes. it will be fine. <br>  at any pet store, there is an entire batch, and they are separated all the time. especially if you take two, because they will each still have one of their siblings with them. and after time goes by, they wont even remember their old family so it wont matter. :)|`|XqfH76PMaa	They are like any other animal and will do fine being separated.  Don't worry about it.  If they realize it, it is only for a short while.  Having two of them, they will still have a playmate and companion, so they will do great.  Don't worry about it.|`|Fmh5G98zaa	Yes, because they might miss each other but as long as they still have some other rat that keeps the company it will be ok.|`|UXgu8RjUaa	make sure that they are old enough to take solid food, other than that, they should be fine :)|`|4jOaN0WIaa	Yes, they will do fine. It isn't like separating human babies from their moms. I had a rabbit who had eight babies this past summer. Believe me, I couldn't keep eight rabbits. Once they were old enough I found them homes. I have the mom and dad and they were fine. She didn't even seem to miss them.
ntfaXs9zaa	ya, im pretty sure hes a purebred, <br>  <br>  p.s. you have a really cute dog?|`|63439e5b52d40d8694adad7cd7a9c505aa	Its hard to see his face and body, but from what I can see, yes he is most likely a purebred.  Looks just like our boy we lost to cancer last year. He was also a Pure Chocolate Lab, but he was very tall and lean, just depends on the individual dog. |`|i56ZDbT6aa	He looks like a chocolate lab to me, but who cares who he is, he's so cute!|`|zZZnQuQJaa	He looks just like the Chocolate Lab I lost earlier this year (RIP Hirsh...), BUT, no papers, no proof he's a purebred.|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	Awwww, how cute! He's winking! He could be a purebred. My German Sheperd is, but doesn't have papers. There have been people that say the same to me, because her confirmation is far from standard. I saw both her parents, and she is all sheperd.|`|XaAzPXn8aa	he looks purebred to me!  But, it's hard to tell completely though, because in the picture, you can only see his face.  You may want to put pictures up with a whole side shot too.|`|ufe1N3hgaa	I'd say with eighty percent accuracy that that is a mix between a lab and a rottweiler. I would contact the person you got it from and have a little word with them. |`|BlSwxngGaa	Looks pure bred to me but what do I know, I'm not a breeder. If he's a good dog and you love him, who cares?<br>  <br>  PS It's adorable that he's winking.|`|JpdVidqxaa	If you didn't pay for papers then he probably is mixed.  |`|Kbo5thC2aa	Looks like a bigger version of my baby Hershey!! a purebred Chocolate Lab!|`|a063525afac8cd769f0358cd6b18ff02aa	He looks like a purebred to me. If he's a good dog and you love him who really cares  |`|TXmAx8jwaa	Aww Hes Cute :)<br>  <br>  To me he looks Purebred but thats my opinion..<br>  <br>  x|`|oqYDuM9faa	he is very handsome dog and he looks like a pure breed but does it really matter if he is not as long as he is loved which looking at him i would say he was|`|XqfH76PMaa	I think he looks purebred.  I don't see where he looks mixed.  He is pretty!|`|DBrNaYNyaa	should of asked what the paretns were, if they werent full pure breed, you dog wouldnt be. |`|inOl1COTaa	Looks like a purebred just alittle older |`|vfxLr7T2aa	He looks like a choc lab to me|`|Embmf9I7aa	yeah looks like a lab to me|`|FPqO2ef3aa	Looks like a lab!! =0) May I add he is very cute and charming.........I mean hes winking at me!! =0P|`|Shp5riE6aa	He looks a little mixed.  I see I get thumbs down for being honest, how nice.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	he is mixed with a black lab.<br>  seriously if you could have got papers with him, then he is purebred, unless the papers aren't recognized.
uGkLRQsxaa	they can live their whole lives w/o substrate and decorations, may not be as happy but they can, most petstores and breeders dont use it|`|mmHJ8Jy1aa	Nope. You'll just have to clean your tank like everyday or everyother day. Don't stop cleaning your tank. Your fish could get ich. |`|v2mz1Lgxaa	they can defintely survive. all they need is h2o and food to survive! the rvael and stuff is not that important! |`|So7lXdBKaa	 these are only for decoration  you fish will be ok as long as he has fresh water and food|`|7C5N5HmBaa	yeah it can he/she will just be more bored then usual.|`|PqfkObRcaa	Many people who keep goldfish, as well as other fish like discus, choose to have a bare bottom tank. The fish don't need it, its just for our visual pleasure. Your fish will be perfectly fine whether or not you choose to add decorations.<br>  <br>  Gravel does hold some of the biological filtration, so if you choose bare bottom I would make sure you have plenty of bio media to make up for it.|`|47b131644ac7221c6af6aae1adb8e0e7aa	Gravel and decor are not absolutely necessary. I would caution that you will need to clean a bit more often because gravel collects debris and keeps it from floating around in the water.  BUT, if you put gravel in it doesn't mean that you don't have to clean because even though the gravel collects debris the nasty chemicals are still present.   Gravel also houses the good bacteria so make sure if you don't use gravel that you have a good water filter so the bacteria can accumulate in the filter. You need good bacteria to have clean water.|`|VYoNzUOtaa	they can live without gravel gra .but i put gravel in so they can look for food they may have missed.they do however need a filter they do leave a lot of waste behind .also put in plastic plants so they have something too swim in and about so their not bored.completly empty tank NO WAY|`|JHO4KG4kaa	the gravel and ornaments are not what makes them live it is food and clean water , don't forget to take him out before you put that stuff in .... and remember to wash it you never know who has touched it with what chemicals on there hands|`|1c4024e3b217f858e49bf522d7f35a41aa	Mmm, I don't know much about fish, but I do know they don't need those things, however its helpful if you want them to survive for a while.|`|AA11901352	Tanks do not need gravel nor do they need decorations.  No they aren't sad because of it.  Water and water quality is more important than decorations, they are there for you not your fish.  If the tank is cycled your fish will be fine.
E0t0ntKZaa	I don't think that's a good idea because it's not natural to it's habitat. Plus it might be harmful for the frog. What if it tries to eat it for some reason? It might kill it because you don't know if there is any chemicals in the styrofoam that are harmful to reptiles. I would just use soil and rocks or soil and gravel. That would be a lot more safer. Why does the tank need to be lighter? If your not moving it from where it is, then does the weight really matter? 
rQ5rUIuMaa	Sounds super-nice! I am currently building a viv in a 55 gal tank but plan to go to a local Reptile Expo in two weeks. Hold on to it til then; it will probably sell. Many people buy reptiles at expos then realize they need a viv.|`|psqkf6rMaa	i wish i could afford it

We got him at 6 weeks. He would be so happy like when the kids came home from school, he would wet all over the place. We would have to grab him up and take him outside soon as he would get this way. He did it for about 3 months. He just would get excited and forgot about controling himself. It was frustrating for awhile. We would have to show him his wrong and say 'no Barney' and take him out. But as he got older it became less and less. He's 3 years now and never has accidents. Just have to work with the dog and our dog still is excited when the kids come home or we all go out and come back. He'll run up to us and greet us but controls his bladder now. <br>  You might could try everytime your dog gets like this, to take him/her to a newspaper or however you are training it. Put the dog there give it extra attention when it does the job right. Puppies are like kids, they strive for attention. Show them extra attention when they do good and less when they're not. Just like with kids animals are different they may learn quicker some things and not so quick others. Just be patient and persistant. I believe your dog will grow out of it in time.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|XVVkrlnTaa	They get control over their bladder at about 6 months. Be patient, he will grow out of it. Just don't punish him for it. They can't help it. |`|Yo8EBj3caa	thats just it, he's excited and doesn;t have much control over his bladder yet<br>  <br>  thought i would add, when he does it, dont yell at him, ignore it. yelling will turn him into a submisive pee'r<br>  <br>  also if he hasnt started peeing when new people come to your house to visit thats a good thing, but it can happen. if it starts to happen and even b4 it starts as a preventative, when someone new comes into your house, or even family memebers including yourself, ignore him until he is calm!<br>  <br>  and one he is calm, talk calmly to him as if you amp him up, it can happen again.|`|ZjN09xEaaa	 Puppies tend to stop this behavior with age, however, negative reinforcement will only make the problem worse.  Below is a short dissertation in regard to this behavior.  Commonly, dogs urinate to show submission when adults; as puppies it may be a simple lack of control which will come with age.   If the problem persists beyond 18 months of age, you may want to seek a trainer's help in curbing the behavior with positive reinforcement.  <br>  <br>  "Many dog owners mistakenly believe that this type of urination is a house training problem, and try to correct it with discipline. To their dismay and frustration, rather than improving, the dog's problem gets worse! Because the message he's sending is misunderstood by the owner, the dog is caught in a vicious cycle - his instincts tell him to urinate to please his superior by showing submission. But when he does, he is punished. He then tries harder to please by urinating even more. This results in more punishment, and still more urination. After a time, the dog may become so confused and insecure that he urinates at the mere sight of a human being or another dog."  <br>  |`|wL9lzhUGaa	He hasn't grown to control his own bladder. It's normal for puppies. In fact, some dogs never do learn how to control their bladder and they pee whenever they feel it coming on.<br>  <br>  Excitement triggers the sphincter for the bladder to open up. He'll grow out of it.
XgVVEKTWaa	Oh I know exactly how you feel.. we had to put down my dog a few years ago. I didn't go in the backyard because it was too lonely. Now we have another dog but as a smaller furry pet you could try:<br>  <br>  Mice<br>  Rats<br>  Rabbits<br>  Birds<br>  Ferrits<br>  Or Guinea Pigs.<br>  <br>  As long as you leave them with enough food and water, I think you are able to leave all of those pets if g oing on a short holiday. I've had guinea pigs, rabbits and mice and they are all very cute. Just beware that mice smell a bit..odd and don't live very long which is sad :( But I think guinea pigs and rabbits live for a few years.<br>  <br>  Hope things go well :)|`|FH0nwdptaa	Actually, stop, think about your life and where you are at.  Is it a good time to get a pet?  Will you marry?  Have kids?  Go back to school?  Take care of a sick relative?  If the answer no to all, then you have time for a pet.  Whatever you do, pet insurance is a must.  Good luck.|`|qcOwLNQEaa	a little furry pet. something to keep in a cage?, or something that a be let out but is still in a cage<br>  <br>  some thing that i would sugjest is a feret. its close to a dog, small furry and has medium upkeep, theyre pretty cool and i heard theyre very adoreable<br>  something to keep in a cage that you can hold are guinea pigs and a rabbit. i would prefer a guinea pig personally but both are good<br>  sorry about your dog,=\ good luck with your new pet|`|Wq35a5goaa	Chinchillas are WONDERFUL pets. They are the softest things God ever made (60 hairs per follicle). They are bigger than hamsters, smaller than bunnies. Their poop is dry like a rabbit's and they don't pee much (unlike guinea pigs). They don't mind being held, but don't mind being ignored. They're quiet and they're cute. They come in colors (standard grey is most popular) and are fun to watch hop around. They're curious and enjoyable to be around. They have some needs that are not the same as hamsters and rats, so make sure you do your homework before you buy or adopt one.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, nothing can replace a dog for unconditional love. If you have the time, perhaps fostering a dog or two for a local shelter could give you time to heal, yet still offer time with a  dog without the intense emotional bond. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chin-chillas.com/chinchilla_care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chin-chillas.com/chinchilla_c...</a>|`|AA10323435	Get a ferret. I have one and he is so fun to play with! Some people say they are mean, but i got mine when he was 3 months old so hes not mean at all! And make sure he is descented too, if you decide to get one. |`|GXCSB2eIaa	i think a hamster would be good.<br>  <br>  -gravywazhere|`|ZRU4kfe6aa	 I would get another, i can feel your pain by putting your dog to sleep i also had to put my dog to sleep last year and decided to get another dog, but i started out with a puppy. I would get another dog but start out as a puppy yes i know about alot of care but you seem to love dogs alot and i can tell you really miss your dog so why not get another animal that you love alot.|`|AA12280301	Well there is a variety of small animals to choose from. There are ferrets, rabbits, mice, rats, gerbils, guinea pigs, and hampsters. I wouldn't suggest a rabbit unless you have good ventilation, their urine and feces stink. but thats a personal thing. The only other problem is that the small furry things do not have a very long lifespan. I guess it's just a personal choice.|`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	yeah Ferrets are great pets, very cost effective too my Kizzy eats cat food a heaped teaspoon of wet food one day the following day 1/4 cup dry biscuits .<br>  Very entertaining little things!|`|WqkEKwUVaa	Hmmmmm no dogs or cats but it must be furry and easy to take care of .... maybe a hamster ive had a hamster before i mean feeding them is easy,i recommend some organic vegetables, lettuce for instance, and make sure only organic don't buy some hamster food(those little pellets aren't really good for em,don't trust those things like they'll have better eyesight and what not or better brain power buy organic and he'll live longer and probably won't get very sick) from pet co he'll be a lot healthier and live a lot longer, 2nd cleaning up after him or her would be very easy as long as you just get some plastic(just some plastic that you put under all the little bedding of the cages that when you clean up it's like a doggy bag for cleanup just pull the plastic up from it after you take the top off so it'll be a lot easier than getting a hose and bringing the cage outside, also it is so cute when they just run around the house in those little hamster balls, just make sure they don't get loose.
fe7v1BSIaa	It may be UTI.<br>  <br>  Symptoms:<br>  1. Pain while urinating, frequent urination, small or no urine at all, are among the first signs to look for. <br>  2. Excessive grooming of genitals, crying while doing it and blood in urine are almost certain symptom of urinary infection in cats and dogs. <br>  3. If your cat has stopped using its litter box and urinates outside of it, you can suspect presence of UTI. <br>  <br>  If you don't think that's it, SOMETIMES, when cats are spayed, DOCTORS DONT TAKE EVERYTHING OUT.<br>  <br>  Go get your cat checked to see what's wrong.<br>  |`|cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	You should give your vet a call anytime your cat does something that does not seem right because it can be a sign of illness, however in this particular case, it is not unknown for a cat to exhibit unspayed behavior for weeks to months after being fixed (true for both male and female) because some have strong hormones that it takes awhile to adjust to the new situation.  Because of the surgery the hormones will be less and when they have burned up their presurgical reserve, the cat will act like it should-like a fixed cat.|`|XOT9rHPMaa	Sounds like a urinary tract infection.  Get her checked out.  Could also be an intestinal infection like Giardia which can be very serious.  |`|XcTJkBtMaa	in the first couple weeks it will take a while for it to kick in.<br>  don't worry.<br>  never get it spade twice....take my advice (that rimed)
