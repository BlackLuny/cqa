AA11165496	Yes you can charge on the PC, and when you plug it into the PC it will recognize it as a gaming controller and install on PC so you can set up/config it to work on almost any PC game. I have a few emulation games that I use my DualShock 3 Controller with, you can also use it as a mouse. I'm charging my controller as I use it on my PC right now, so anyone who said that you can't use it on the PC is wrong.

oM7zA7Jhaa	Hey man, welcome to the guitar world! It is called a guitar cable, simple as that. You can get a really good one for around $15 , depending upon how long you want it too be. Some shops will sell strings by themselves, but you are better off getting a new set, i know it can be frustrating, i remember being 12 and always breaking strings but never having money to buy them, or picks. Yes your setup is just fine for a begginner, it really doesn't matter what your playing, as long as its in tune, and you have determination! good luck brother!|`|N0pevlehaa	What you have is fine for beginners.  You can buy a simple guitar cable at a local Radio shack, best buy, circuit city, music store, etc.  THey are not hard to find, just ask for a guitar cable. <br>  <br>  Just get the cheapest one that is a suitable length.. it is not the type of cable that makes the "right sound", its the guitar and amp, and of course, you!

HVQFVtelaa	Information, yes. Help, maybe. Welcome to the wonderful world of digital TV. You didn't mention the type of antenna you are using, it better at least be amplified. But that's only part of it.<br>  <br>  Digital converters operate on a "yes, no" basis. If the converter gets enough signal to suit it, yes, you will get a perfect picture. If the signal is barely short of perfection, no, you don't get a picture at all.<br>  <br>  Many of the station towers still have their analog antenna at the top, and the digital one some 100 feet lower, degrading the range. Add  to that the range limiting factors of the new technology, and you have a reception problem.<br>  <br>  Some people in the country that got stations before from surrounding cities and other states that were less than perfect, may get nothing at all from digital. <br>  <br>  Now may be a good time for us to buy stock in cable, satellite, and digital antenna companies.

u6BNPURKaa	My phone company is ATT and they have an option available for my home phone line that is FREE. Forget what its called specifically, but if you or your parents call or go online, look under the phone services. It is an option that allows you to press three buttons during a phone call that is harassing in nature, and it alerts the local police and sends them the callers information. I have gotten stalkerish calls at work, and get hangup calls at home.. So I got this option added on to my phone just in case. Maybe this would help you?|`|cXtEx98Haa	Most and I think all telephone companies offer the option of your phone not allowing calls without identification to be accepted.  If you can still locate the information you got when you got your phone service, it will tell you how to turn it on.  If not, go online to your telephone company's web site and it should tell you.  If all else fails call the phone company.<br>  <br>  There is even a service where you can block a specific number.  I don't think from from your question that even the number is sent through, so I would go with the above option.  I think the option is called "Anonymous Call Rejection."<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I know those calls can be very annoying, maybe even a little scary.|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	Get added to the do not call list. After a couple months the automated calls will go away. Most likely that is what is is. <br>  <br>  It could also be looking for a computer to hack or fax machine to spam.|`|1bvl5zbkaa	Its called a Prank Call.|`|We23vvk2aa	That's been happing to me for the past, like, month or so. I haven't done it myself,  but I would call them back, or just ignore it and wait for the answering machine until u answer it. <br>  doubt that helps because I'm facing the same problem. (they even called twice in a row today)<br>  good luck.|`|ktTZMhl0aa	Well it really depends on your annoyance threshhold. If it is really annoying you/causing lack of sleep/other violent reactions, I would call the police. I'm pretty sure those kind of calls are illegal.<br>  <br>  They could probably help you trace back the caller.|`|s0HlOgyeaa	dont answer ur phone ever :x|`|tP2NScAiaa	they'rprobly  ate im guessing.do *69 and find out who it is.|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	take a deep breath and count your blessings.
AA11148143	No. Nor broadcast, either.
wM37GTbNaa	I really liked it for a while, but now it is just getting boring because it is the same exact thing over and over. It is really good if you want to get some gamerscore cuz the achievements are extremely easy. A lot of people say that is gets boring really fast, but if you play on xbox live it is pretty fun on versus mode, another thing that is if you play it on expert it takes a while to get boring just because it is challenging. <br>  So overall I would say no it is not worth it right now to buy it because it is still $60 but if you wait a while for the price to go down or find a sale it would probably be worth it. Otherwise, you could get Call of Duty World at War, and that is really fun, but once you beat the campaign you can play Nazi Zombies, which me and some of my friends think is better than Left 4 Dead in some aspects.|`|YkZzLCKvaa	well my cousin got i heard alot of cool things about it but when i played i was like naw i aint going to get i dont really like graphics u run hella fast not many guns same charcaters same zombies its ok i give it a 6.5 out of 10 look up youtube vids to see gameplay|`|CDqbtlbraa	I enjoy playing Left 4 Dead<br>  Gamestation did  a deal on it recently<br>  It has the four campaigns<br>  Four player on-line player co-op<br>  The new free DLC soon with survival mode<br>  Where you survive wave after wave of zombies<br>  Not to mention verus mode where you play as the infected zombies|`|QEIhNVUcaa	nah its really fun when you play with your friends but after a while like a week or so it gets dull so i would advise renting or borrowing it from a chum who actually bought that game...just saying....|`|AA11207946	Its only fun with friends, gets boring after awhile|`|iClAIGn2aa	if you don t have online then no, but if you do then yes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I suggest gears 2 its better|`|ye6Buzneaa	if u have live, its amazing. but if you dont have live. DONT BUY IT|`|QIlhmWwBaa	is a really  good game but it's so short it actually gets boring after a while|`|LfqvlxSBaa	There's no point asking an anonymous market, only you can be the judge of what you like. <br>  <br>  I think this game is repetitive and looks like a 6th gen original xbox game, particularly how the characters move. Also the games depth perspective doesn't look right to me. Fun for an hour then ZZzzz <br>  <br>   ( see what I mean ?)|`|l5AOEcZ4aa	It's worth it if you like a game where winning depends on the co operation of everyone on the team.|`|4Z0G5x52aa	Oh yes.

wYg3del2aa	It depends on your phone.<br>  <br>  Look at the manual, or simply plus in some iPod headphones. For 99% of phones Bluetooth acts the same as a regular headset.
j5Apt8hWaa	The Canon EF 70-300 mm will focus the fastest and if you ever buy a Canon full frame body like the 5D or 1Ds, you can use it with the new body.  Any EF-S lenses you have, cannot be used on full frame cameras, whether one of the 5D or 1D cameras or 35 mm EOS cameras.<br>  <br>  The rest have their limitations and the generics will eventually not satisfy you as a shooter.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Number 4.

I wiil say that I almost bought a PS3 recently, but just for the Blu- ray option. I have a PS2 & am not hip to the fact that they cancelled the backward compatibility on the PS3. If my PS2 breaks, I don't want to have to buy another one just to keep playing the games for it because Sony wants to make some changes.

aNlT1NRqaa	Shallow DoF (short) means the background and foreground is out of focus, while your subject is (hopefully) sharp. (f1.4, f2.8) Often done with a longer (85-300mm) lens.<br>  <br>  Long Dof means your background is relatively or very sharp, along with your subject. (f16, f22) Usually done with a shorter (14-35mm) lens, but not always.|`|tHjBr4L4aa	The correct terms are "shallow" depth-of-field and "extended" depth-of-field, also known as DOF.<br>  <br>  Shallow DOF is selected when you choose a wide open aperture for any given lens, such as 2.8, 3.5, etc.  This puts only one part of a scene in sharp focus and creatively blurs the rest of the image.  Think of a single flower, standing out in a bed of flowers.  This technique replicates what your mind and eyes do when you are looking at the world around you.  Otherwise, you'd be confused by all in sensory input.<br>  <br>  Extended DOF is selected when you choose a very small aperture, such as 16, 22, or 32.  This puts more if the scene in focus and is the technique of choice when you want equal sharpness both near and far.  Extended DOF is important when shooting large group photos or trying to capture the vastness of something like the Grand Canyon.<br>  <br>  Another factor that affects DOF is the focal length of the lens.  A wide angle lens, such as an 18 or 24mm inherantly has deeper DOF.  A telephoto lens, such as a 200mm has a shallower DOF.<br>  <br>  Here's a few weblinks with more information and some examples.<br>  <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/depth-of-field.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutoria...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhus4atoqEE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhus4atoq...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/fototech/htmls/depth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/fot...</a><br>  <br>  The Youtube link has some great info and I recommend it highly.<br>  <br>  Learning to use depth-of-field will help you become a much better photographer.

I mean, most people barely fill their iPods half the time.|`|itWQFMuRaa	go for the 80 gig. trust me i have an 8 gig ipod touch and unless you have 100000000000000000000 songs then you  never going to fill it ....my 8 gig holds 1200 songs .... you do the math|`|KvkEOi4Taa	get the 80.

KLL0Acrwaa	1) I checked bhphotvideo.com and found that the Zuiko actually sells for $205 while the Pentax sells for $199.95, so the price difference is neglible.<br>  <br>  2)  The Zuiko is a specialized "pancake" lens, which means it's flatter than a regular lens.  This increases the cost somewhat, even though the Pentax you cite has a wider aperture.<br>  <br>  3)  the Olympus lenses are of newer design, for the 4/3 system.<br>  <br>  4) the 4/3 system is new and thus, has to amortize the costs of the new system, whereas established systems from Canon, Nikon, and Pentax have a lot of costs already paid for.  Hence a Nikon 50mm f/1.8 can cost $125 and a Pentax 50mm f/1.4 can cost a lot less than a Zuiko.<br>  <br>  5)  Olympus doesn't sell as many products as others and thus you get some modest increase in pricing for a smaller volume product.  So, for example, notice that Nikon's 50mm f/1.4 sells for $400 (because the 50mm f/1.8 sells far, far better and the 1.4 is more specialized and more expensive).<br>  <br>  6) Interestingly, a Nikon pancake lens, the manual focus 45mm f/2.8P costs about $400 used.  It works on Nikon AF cameras to meter, but won't AF.  Because of its pancake design, it's quite expensive.<br>  <br>  7)  Finally, there's no other choices if you have an Olympus.  Essentially, there's not many lenses being made by third parties (Sigma makes some, for example), so Olympus can charge you more and get away with it, because you have fewer options for lens choices.|`|RxB0ivXoaa	I have an E-510 and the 25mm pancake lens. I was able to get mine for $169.99 on sale through an online store. Shop around, you can find some better deals fro that lens. As for why the Zuiko lenses are more, a major point of consideration is that they, unlike other lenses, were built for digital photography from the ground up. The Digital Zuiko lenses offer better quality over standard lenses, quality that you pay for.<br>  <br>  You could also look at the Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 Leica lens or Sigma 24mm f1.8. These are also four thirds mount lenses and will work on the E-510. <br>  <br>  Remember, Olympus isn't in the four thirds by themselves, they have partner companies that develop lenses and camera bodies using the same mount.

T5MR7fNHaa	You are correct, you need a 24V DC power unit, or a transformer with a 24V secondary plus a bridge rectifier to convert it to DC.<br>  <br>  The power unit, whichever you use, needs to be rated at least the same current as the klaxon motor.<br>  <br>  If it's going to get a lot of use, use a power supply that is rated 50% higher current than the klaxon as motors generally take more current when starting than running.<br>  <br>  The best place to switch the circuit is in one of the transformer connections, either the live feed if the switch is rated for 240V mains or between the transformer and rectifier if you prefer to switch the 24V side.<br>  <br>  If you are using a domestic doorbell type push switch, these are not suitable for either mains voltage or high currents (in the 24V circuit).<br>  <br>  To use a bell push, swap your 240V relay for a 24V AC one and feed the switch / relay coil from the transformer secondary, using the relay contact to switch one of the wires from the transformer to the bridge rectifier.<br>  <br>  <br>  Make sure everything is properly insulated and fused!<br>  <br>  If you are not sure how to do it, find a local electrician who is willing to help.
14512ce63e83e4e4a2a4411804cb548faa	Usually you just open the On Screen guide and push the Record button on your remote. It might give you choices of whether you just want to record that one show or it might give you the option of recording that show's entire series. To watch your recorded shows I think you just push the Menu button on your remote, and click on My Recordings or something similar to that

Xxviy63Paa	without a composite video capture device, which a tv tuner is an example of, there is no way to plug a ps2 into a vga or DVI input. *<br>  <br>  You may be better off getting a monitor with composite or component input. Or even get a small HDTV with every kind of input. You're more likely to get a wide variety of inputs on a TV. I use a 27" HDTV for everything because it has vga input as well as all the usual tv stuff.<br>  <br>  It may be easier to find a monitor with component video input than composite. If so, you can get the ps2 component video cable which is about $20. This would allow progressive scan on ps2 games that support it, there are about 100. That's maybe 10 percent of them. But it's worth it because they look much better. God of War is amazing in 480p, looks like a ps3 game.<br>  <br>  There are also signal conversion boxes that say they convert just about anything to just about anything, with inputs for composite, component, VGA and DVI, and outputs for the same... they are mainly made in Asia and I don't know if they really work well. I doubt it.<br>  <br>  * there is an official ps2 vga cable, but it only works with the ps2 linux runtime environment that it was sold with. Not for ps2 games. Also very hard to find. So for all intents and purposes the ps2 can only use composite or component.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	I've hooked my pS2 to my TV tuner which is hooked to my Mac mini.

It loosens the buttons on the phone, drains the battery rather quickly, and makes the phone slower.|`|sCgy6H99aa	my dad said that too but my phone broke cause it drowned|`|8v40KEd0aa	Not for my phone or my niece's.

(my brother broke the top off of one of his doing this) and the battery does drain fast depending on what kind of phone you have. hope this helps!
e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	Even if you wired the two batteries in series for 24 volts, you wouldn't have enough voltage to light a 60 watt house light to any extent.  You may not even get a glow out of it.  But you cant wire the batteries in parallel to give you better current capacity and use a 60 watt, 12 volt light bulb.  If you ask around you can find 12 volt bulb that in the same size and shape as a standard 120 volt bulb.  Just don't get the two mixed up.  At 60 watts, the light bulb would draw 5 amps from the batteries.|`|i0WQzVDZaa	Anything is possible but why would you want to?|`|bc6548196cb0f07ba846ab5da2d6249caa	well yea you could... though it wont really work that well. I suppose if you want to though you would take a wire and jump from positive to negative, then positive on the next battery to one side of your switch. then from the other side of your switch to your light, then from the other side of your light to your negative......<br>  <br>  (1-)---(1+)----(2-)---(2+)-------Switc...<br>  <br>  This won't really work that great since a house light uses 120V AC  and what you are doing will use 24V DC. Mind if i ask whaT THIS IS FOR?  and also, be careful, it sounds like this is a car battery which can hurt a lot if shocked.|`|0h9aD7Toaa	if you want to play around with dc 12 volt batteries go to an rv dealer and pick up a 12 volt lamp, they make 12 volt lamps that will screw right into a regular lamp (edison) socket, and then you can build somethig to play with and leave the power in your house alone.. between the rv dealer and home depot or the like you should be able to build something pretty cheep..

First, you can call customer service with your wireless carrier.  Some carriers will allow blocking from specific numbers.  Also, your handset may be able to block the call, customer service should be able to tell you if your handset supports that feature.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you can file a complaint with the police department.  They can subpoena phone records from your wireless carrier if you supply them with the dates and times of the call.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|c6591459150d7505bcdb71e018b0b3abaa	The only way to do this is to get your telephone company and possibly even the police involved. Whether this number can be blocked or not depends on your country/state, how serious the harrassment is, etc. The only thing I can suggest is calling your telephone company (they'll probably have a phone number specifically for reporting abuse), and see what they advise. It might not be possible, but try it.

99ab666d64d9efa53079a431c3c15bd0aa	If dealing with Motorola directly, (yes, you can) then your warranty spells out the policy pretty detailed. They will most likely replace the ROKR with a refurbished ROKR if within Warranty term. You will NOT be able to request a new model. IF for some reason they do not have any ROKR refurbs in service stock, then they have the option of replacing with a comparable unit (their choice). So, you MAY get a ROKR, or something else. No way to tell until you send it to them for repair under warranty.  Check the Warranty agreement since it states all of these terms and exclusions (i.e. they will NOT cover neglect like water damage of any type, etc).<br>  <br>  Now, IF you purchased the phone from Cingular originally, then you can pop into any Cigular store and they have some flexibility of swapping for greater or equal at a incremental cost. Cingular will NOT have much in the way of refurb service stock most likely, so you can possibly trade-up. Again, it is THEIR policy at that point and Cingular DOES maintain some level of refurb service units, so the store MAY direct you to Cingular's 800-number for a warranty exchange.|`|4ae3caeeb07dac41fd30b07000a4c7b3aa	Go to Cingular.  The same thing happened with us but we had to pay the difference.  What went wrong with your rokr?  All of a sudden ours just stopped working.

d3ae155558b9cbe826b8103176ad795caa	This is certainly possible.  What I would recommend that if you purchase a phone on Ebay, make sure the seller is reputable enough to tell you the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) before you purchase it.  Then call your local Verizon Wireless store and ask them to verify the ESN is not on the lost/stolen phone list.  If the seller won't provide this info, don't buy from them.  You also need to make sure that the phone meets the enhanced 911 requirements so that the phone can be activated.  If the phone is less than 2 years old, you don't have to worry about this, but if it is older, you need to be careful.  If you find a bargain that meets all of these requirements, when you get your new phone, log in to your "My Account" on VerizonWireless.com and activate your new handset.  If you take it into your local store or call customer service, they will charge you $20 to activate it.  If you provide your own handset in this manner it does not renew your contract but you might have to adjust your special features like picture messaging or VCast services.|`|b3a9348147926ead3fe4f6be04bdb2a8aa	yes  all you have to do is go in and have them put your phone number on it|`|bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	As the others have said, yes you can do it. the main thing you must do is make sure the phone is a Verizon phone, if it's not, DONT BUY|`|AA12018921	yes<br>  i had a vodaone contract and brought a newer phone of ebay and then just put my contract sim into the new phone off ebay<br>  as long as the phone isnt locked you shoudnt have a problem|`|AA12092526	Sometimes there is a fee for that, but most companies will just do it for you.

This modification to your receiver by itself is not illegal, however the very moment you connect your receiver to the dish and point it to one of the Dish Network satellites you instantly became criminal.

Why pay 30 dollars for a service that drops every call and hardly ever connects. thats a waist when you can get a phone for say 50 dollars that will connect every call and never drop. So just remember. Its not just the price, its the price, AND the quality.
e412551d6c02320bcec6f322a94b18bbaa	That depends on if you want to keep them in your library on your computer or not.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep them in your iTunes library, but take them off of your iPod, then you'll need to do a few things. Plug your iPod into the computer, and let iTunes load. When it finishes loading, it should be on the Summary page where it shows the info of your iPod. If not, click on the Ipod on the menu on the left side of iTunes. Near the bottom, there should be some checkboxes with some options next to them. Check the one that says "Only sync checked items" and click the Apply button. Now you can go back to the main Library, and start unchecking the songs that you want to take off of your iPod. Once you are done, just re-sync the iPod, and the songs will be removed.<br>  <br>  If you want to remove them completely from iTunes, just open up iTunes, and go to the main Library. Right-click and delete the songs you don't want on it anymore. Once you are done, re-sync your iPod, and the songs will be removed.|`|87025faa1ad26d83e76310469a07a407aa	If you still want to have the songs on iTunes but not your iPod.  Then first, lock the iPod (the switch that stops button clicks).  Then connect it to your computer.  On the left hand side your iPod should come up.  Delete whatever songs you dont want and add the ones you do want.  Each time you connect it to your computer though, make sure to lock it.|`|6EIK8ryFaa	There are various things that you can do.  First off if you have Windows Media Player and stuff like that you can go into there and where it says to upload songs onto the device you should be able to also remove songs.  It will display a list of the songs already on the iPod and you can remove them by right clicking with your mouse button.  Good luck!|`|AA10406797	If you plan to totally delete off your songs you can select your unwanted song on your iTunes and hits delete key to delete it. Or you can untick it and sync. it to your ipod. So, your ipod will only left what you want. Besides, your iTunes, your unwant items will still they.|`|STzOZ1cyaa	Go into iTunes, and go to your library. There are other ways (more complicated) to get songs of of your iPod, keep that in mind but this is the easiest. Select any songs that you don't want on your iPod and press delete. Only delete them from your library, not the computer! Next, plug in your iPod, and open its tab in iTunes. Click on Update. This will remove the songs that aren't in your library anymore, and I hope that works. It did for me anyways.|`|aj7Zx25Eaa	Hook it up to your computer, highlight what you don't want.....delete........|`|jQKu6r62aa	you plug the ipod into your computer and under devices it should say your ipod and you delete whatever songs you would like to.

If you want a vast library of music, and you want to download it legally (you should), then go with an iPod. iTunes had a vast online library, and it has an easy way to configure your songs. Plus there is a huge fan-base for iPods, so if anything goes wrong, or if you have a question about something, then there is actually people willing to help. Unlike some other mp3 player companies, Apple actually tries to help you when your mp3 player is having problems. Plus they come in massive sizes, and if you buy a video type, you can watch all of your music videos!|`|AA11251656	well the ipod doesnt have a custom eq.. the sounds isnt that great either..<br>  the creative zen vision m is better. custom eq.

Connect the LINE OUT of the Cassette deck to the LINE IN of the Computer Soundcard <br>  2. Select the soundcard as the preferred recording device (under control panel - multimedia icon) <br>  3. Ensure the LINE IN Fader on the audio mixer of the computer is not muted <br>  4. Launch the audio recording software <br>  5. Depending on the software used, activate and check all the settings to allow recording <br>  6. If possible, monitor the incoming signal from the cassette deck using the audio software to ensure the incoming signal is not clipping (Too Hot; Levels Too High) <br>  7. Set the appropriate levels for recording and rewind the cassette tape <br>  8. Activate the recording on the computer and playback the cassette tape <br>  9. Once the material on the cassette tape has been recorded into the computer, save the material as .WAV format and edit the wave files accordingly.(Break them up and save them into the individual tracks; process the files with the noise reduction software; edit out the unwanted parts; etc.) <br>  10. When all editing have been completed, the number of .wav files should correspond to the number of songs on the cassette, unless some songs have been omitted. <br>  11. Next, close the audio recording software (Be sure to save all your work) and launch the CD authoring software <br>  12. Select for audio CD writing and import the .wav files and arrange them according to the sequence required (Exact procedure of import would be dependent on the software used) <br>  13. Load in a blank CDR disc and write to the disc using disc-at-once mode and finalized as a CD-DA format (Exact procedure of writing would be dependent on the software used) <br>  <br>  SUGGESTIONS<br>  <br>  - Chose a good CDR disc to ensure durability and integrity of the disc.<br>  - Try with different brands to see which works well with your CD writer and can playback on your CD Player.<br>  - Remember that the limit for a regular CDR is 74mins of audio or 650M byte of data.<br>  - If you use a 80mins CDR disc, make sure both the CD writer and CD authoring software supports it.<br>  - There are many software out there, some are specifically for recording or CD authoring while others are an all-in-one solution.<br>  - Pick one that is most suitable to your needs, applications and budget.<br>  - Ultimately, the quality of your end result will depend on several things such as the initial sonic quality of the cassette, the quality of the soundcard used, the power and flexibility of the computer, audio recording software and noise reduction software, your editing skills, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Audacity, is a free audio editing program that you can get it here:<br>  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">http://audacity.sourceforge.net</a><br>  <br>  With Audacity is you can record one whole side of the tape, then you can go back & highlight each song individually then click: File > Export Selection as  "wav".<br>  <br>  Once you do this for each side of the tape, you will have your .wav files that you can use Windows Media Player (or something similar) to burn to CD.|`|IlqGLBGAaa	i dont now of any right now, but you can by tape players that fit into the stand drive bay of your computer tower and you can loop the tapes by playing them back through your burner.

It's a little extra work, but I like having the bonus tracks.<br>  If you'd rather not go through the whole buying blank cds and burning them, just use Walmart Music Downloads.

Man that phone was annoying, it kept doing funny things while I was talking because of where those touch buttons are they press up against your face. Also getting voice mail was a pain because as soon as you get connected it pulls up a menu and you cant type in numbers to put in your password, so you have to quick clear evertything out then type in your password.

tXcJAEWGaa	En definición un transistor es un componente electrónico, tanto para circuitos analógicos como digitales, que va a tener la función de aumentar la corriente de se?ales (audio, pulsos, video, etc). Esta compuesto por uniones de material tipo P y N (o sea Silicio y Germanio, entre otros). Por ser un semiconductor, su uso es extremadamente importante en muchos circuitos.  Los tipos de transistores, en cuanto a material existen dos:<br>  <br>  -NPN<br>  -PNP<br>  <br>  La nomenclatura NPN se refiere a que hay una capa de Silicio, en seguida una de Germanio y al ultimo otra de Silicio. Y así para el PNP (Germanio-Silicio-Germanio).<br>  <br>  Los transistores tienen tres terminales o pins:<br>  <br>  -Base<br>  -Colector<br>  -Emisor<br>  <br>  Es muy importante saber identificarlos ya que al armar un circuito podemos provocar un mal funcionamiento o que no funcione.<br>  <br>  El transistor tiene dolarización directa e inversa, para cada una va a tener una función en especial, también existen (gráficamente) tres zonas:<br>  <br>  -Corte<br>  -Saturación<br>  -Activa<br>  <br>  En la zona de corte vamos a tener un transistor inutilizado<br>  En la zona de saturación es cuando empieza a funcionar <br>  En la activa es cuando ya esta realizando su función<br>  <br>  Hay dos tipos de portadores para la electricidad: electrones negativos y huecos positivos. <br>  En el material tipo "n", los electrones son portadores mayoritarios de carga y los huecos portadores minoritarios de carga. <br>  El material tipo "p", los huecos son los portadores mayoritarios de carga y los electrones, portadores minoritarios de carga. <br>  El material de tipo "n" tiene los dos tipos de portadores de carga; pero los electrones son los portadores primarios de corriente. <br>  El material de tipo "p" tiene los dos tipos de portadores de carga; pero los huecos son los portadores primarios de corriente. <br>  Los transistores bipolares tienen tres electro9dos. Son el emisor, la base, y el colector. <br>  Hay dos tipos de transistores bipolares: "pnp" y "npn". <br>  Los transistores bipolares utilizan los dos tipos de portadores de carga, o sea, electrones y huecos. <br>  Normalmente, un transistor "npn" funciona con su base y su colector positivos con respecto a su emisor. <br>  Un transistor "pnp" funciona normalmente con su base y su colector negativos con respecto a su emisor|`|XW0Necmwaa	Un transistor es un circuito electronico que generalmente tiene uso para oscilar un circuito, es decir, abrir y cerrar.<br>  Eso es lo que se, y es mas o menos la definición.<br>  <br>  Saludos

nM8GASFlaa	I have three kidsand I'd say a good age is about 11 or twelve.  My kids are very active and it helps to know when and what time they need to be picked up from practice or any other activity they may be involved with. This doesn't mean they get free reign either.   They have time restrictions and must give up the phone before bed on school nights.  They also must get good grades and do their chores etc. or they lose the phone privileges. Its a great thing to take away when they don't behave as they should.   Believe me attitudes tend to change when they know they can lose the phone.  Also, never threaten, they know the rules if they cross the line just once you take the phone for lets say a week.  You must do this from the first violation or it will never work and they'll end up controlling you intead.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|46981ebb6214b0be4cf57bf365fe4b42aa	i got mine when i was 10...used it a lot and my parents were glad they got it for me so i could be safe cuz i went on lots of trips and stayed home alone a lot.|`|7yelHDwRaa	Nowadays children don't go to playgrounds.

Having a kid who ignores your phone calls can be frightening to a parent, who of course assumes the worst, and teaches them to be disrespectful, which is a bad behavior to reinforce.

cZvsE3xTaa	Yes, a 9V adapter is probably fine.  It kind of depends on the variability of the end device's power demand.  If it draws current without spiking, then the 9V, 1.2A will be fine.  Most devices are capable of a volt or two variation in supply potential.  It's more important that the rated delivery current is correct.|`|x2FqgPY9aa	here's a link to them on ebay.

abd61a98e6e67d399e17bc8f90e1d20faa	iPods are able to play through your radio when you purchase the Griffen iTrip (usually $20-$40 extra). This produced pretty clear music through fm stations.

Recommendations differ between manufacturers.<br>  <br>  But anyway wiping the screen with a dry soft lens-cleaning cloth from an optical store (one of those used to clean eyeglasses) should be enough.  You just have to be careful to not put much pressure to the screen when you wipe it.<br>  <br>  If this dry cloth method is not enough (very rare).  Then you better get two of those clothes and use the first one dampened with water and then use the second one to dry.<br>  <br>  These lens-cleaning cloths are lint-free and they won't scratch your screen.|`|zFuJDt04aa	get a dry, clean rag and wipe it off smoothly.|`|7dLiFX0Taa	Opposed to buying special cleaning kits, you can mix water and Isopropyl alcohol (add 70%) and then get a peice of microfibre cloth.

It shouldn't cost your friend anything to receive your text message from the US though.  I'm pretty sure all providers in the US have an international option, so just go online and see what their rates are for int'l txt messaging.

C2ZZV5RLaa	Bueno existen varias formas de hacerlo de acuerdo al encapsulado del transistor,   pero la forma mas confiable es midiendo con un buen multimetro (multitester).<br>  <br>  Asumo que debes tener conocimientos basicos del transistor y sus semejansas a un diodo.  siendo asi un transistor se asemeja a dos diodos unidos, la union de estos el la que corresponde a la base del transistor y siempre estan unidos por sus catodos    o por sus anodos   nunca  catodo con anodo o viseversa.  Esto es lo que crea los dos tipos de transistor.<br>  <br>  Lo primero que debes hacer es identificar la base,  se hace buscando el pin que indique como un diodo con los otros dos terminales, en ese momento has encontrado la base,  si lo lograste con la punta positiva del multimetro quiere decir que la base es positiva y que el transistor es tipo NPN,  y si es la punta negativa sera  PNP.<br>  Despues mides en escala de diodo  de la base a un pin  y despues al otro pin,  obtendras un numero en cada medicion,<br>  el pin que te indica el numero mas pequeno  es el colector y logicamente el otro sera el emisor.<br>  <br>  Aqui puedes encontrar mas informacion:<br>  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~chure/Medida.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/~chure/Medida....</a><br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado, si necesitas alguna aclaracion me lo haces saber.|`|T4jyM6ABaa	aver si te ayuda esta pajina.<br>  <a href="http://www.forosdeelectronica.com/about393.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.forosdeelectronica.com/about3...</a><br>  Suerte.

d3ae155558b9cbe826b8103176ad795caa	The iPhone is a GSM only phone.  Verizon Wireless uses a CDMA network.  The 2 types of networks are incompatible. Trying to use a GSM phone on a CDMA network would be like trying to play a DVD in your VCR. It just would not work. The only Verizon phone's that use SIM cards are the World Edition phones like the Blackberry 8830 smart-phone or the Motorola Z6c. These are quad band phones that support GSM networks when there is no CDMA network available, but the iPhone does not even support CDMA, so it could not be used on Verizon.

The 40GB, new 80GB, and upcoming 160GB models have neither.<br>  <br>  The PS2's GPU was actually in many ways more powerful than the PS3's GPU (which borrows a lot of processing power from Cell to get the better graphics). Many tech web sites think it would be impossible for the PS3 to emulate the PS2's GPU to a satisfactory level.|`|HekFanRvaa	just to make things clear for you, backwards compatibilty is a hardware related issue not software. this is why the 80GB b/c is more expensive than the later 80GB. The emulator is a separate hardware. the new 160GB would be the same price as the 80GB b/c console to compensate for the loss of backwards compatibility.<br>  <br>  I just don't understand why people care so much about backwards compatibility.

It ain't easy.<br>  <br>  The real problem is that the semi-conductors of the PS2 are not being installed in the 40GB PS3.<br>  <br>  From Sony:<br>  "The 40GB model, to be launched in Europe on 10th October, is a new model and is not equipped with any of the semi conductors from the PS2, and backwards compatibility would therefore have to be achieved by software emulation alone.<br>  <br>  "The sheer numbers of PS2 titles available, together with the increased complexity of using a software only solution for each and every title means that to ensure accurate software emulation for the majority would be technically challenging, time consuming and costly. As we have mentioned on several occasions, our engineering resources are now focused on developing new and innovative features and services for the PS3 and, as a result the 40GB model does not have backwards compatibility with PS2 titles."<br>  <br>  I don't think it will ever happen, personally.|`|jWY0lMu8aa	Thats tough.<br>  <br>  however, the PS2 is going to be phased out soon, and when that happens, backwards compatibility should be added to future consoles. <br>  <br>  So its the waiting game.|`|nPufoicEaa	U CANT MAKE TH 40GB BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE, JUST THE 80GB, BUT THE NEW 8OGB CORE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE|`|SGa0hIPRaa	Dude its not about the software, it's about the chip. the hardware is different.

zYnscugSaa	The PS3 is very quiet, especially compared to the 360. If you don't notice a major difference in the sound coming from the PS3 compared to a 360 you have a problem. Make sure your PS3 is in an open, well ventilated area with plenty of air flow. I run my PS3 for hours and sometimes days at a time, and it's whisper quiet. The fan usually stays at the lowest speed, rarely goes to the second, and never to the third. Changing the hard drive to reduce the operating temperature is an interesting idea, but it's not the solution to your problem.|`|GVcO1dtnaa	I don't think the majority of the heat comes from the hard drive.

I've never had one but you could try it. They work pretty well for 360's. |`|7tYWqmZnaa	The HDD isn't what's generating heat. It is the Cell and the RSX. When the PS3 boots up the fans are basically off, when they start spinning, you can hear them.
AA10407643	they are not selling games yet. idk when they will. i have tried downloading the games from the sketchy sites and i have no idea how to put them on my zune.<br>  <br>  so you we will have to wait a little while until they sell games to get more.<br>  <br>  sorry!
AA10923128	Well you'd have to get a micoSD card for it.<br>  <br>  The phone its self only has 63mb for music.  It would be a hand full of songs at most.  Definatly less then your 60 songs.<br>  <br>  You should be able to pick up a microSD card for a reasonalbe price.  That will expand the memory to a decent size.  A 1GB card for example would give you about 250 songs.

1147f6bc5b79333d10353a380f9a13f3aa	Fredo cher ami, je trouve excelent ,lors de ta quéstion avoir specifié le budget dont tu dispose pour un camescope haute définition. Voici pour ton budget c'est que je te conseille: JVC modél GZ HD 7 ou JVC modél GZ HD 3 , avec 3 CCD mais a disque dur , ou un trés bon compromis chez la marque Canon mais en mini dv comme format et pas de technologie de 3 CCD ,pour le panasonic et sony rien de 3 ccd en HD avec ce budget ,faut aller pour panasonic a 800 euros environ voir plus et full HD mais pour Sony en FULL HD à 3 CCD ,grand publique rien ,mais en mono CCD oui .ne touche pas le Toshiba qui possede déja le Blue Ray et disque dur à la fois,l'image est horrible ,avec un capteur mono ccd et pire qualité et cher en plus , presque 850 euros.,que personellement je l'estime à 450 euros.|`|LA3JNlxRaa	Por favor, traduzaaaa!!!<br>  haushaushuahsuhaushauhs

hJP9y6kjaa	<br>  The correct answer is "Attenuate" and means that when you push a button the volume is cut by a certain amount... perhaps -12 db, maybe a little more. You can still hear it in the background, but not enough to interfere with things like phone conversations or whatever.<br>  <br>  Attenuate means to weaken, shrivel, shrink, etc. The signal is attenuated, the signal is weakened, meaning its volume is lowered.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	it's like mute but it doesn't kill the sound completely not sure what it stands for though|`|feuGMu1vaa	ATT stands probably for "Attention" or something. it is useful when you're in the car and you're getting a phone call, so instead of using your time to turn down the volume one-by-one, the ATT button does it for you, but it does not mute it completely. When you press it again, the volume returns to the previous setting.<br>  :)

HJWAHxVoaa	Your MTU test requires that XBOX Live run a Diagnostic Test via their servers. If you look at the detail of the failed MTU test it should state in the first paragraph that the XBOX Live Diagnostic Server timed out. If this is the case, its because their Live Servers are offline and your system cannot complete the test. <br>  <br>  In the second paragraph it might even say that your router or gateway DOES meets the requirements. If it doesn't then you may have an issue.<br>  <br>  To sum this up, when Live is fully functioning, the Diagnostic Server will go online and will accept your MTU settings and you wont even remember there was a problem.|`|4c1nn6hAaa	The xbox live people are doing their annual fall update.

7tYWqmZnaa	No, HD DVD uses a different laser.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	To play HD-DVDs on your 360, you will need to buy the Xbox 360 HD-DVD add-on drive.  This item was discontinued early this year after Toshiba dropped support for HD-DVD.  This add-on drive attached to your 360 via a USB cable.  The 360 cannot play HD-DVDs without this drive, and the HD-DVD drive is only used for movies - games won't work in it.<br>  <br>  To get HD out of your HD-DVD drive your 360 will need to be connected to a HDTV with either a HDMI cable, or the 360's component video cable kit.|`|JPDpxPc2aa	You can play upscaled DVDs on a 360 but not HD DVD because the HD DVD player isn't built in. <br>  <br>  And HD DVD lost to blu-ray. So what you want to do is either download HD movies onto the 360 or buy a blu-ray player.|`|FKo8U4mEaa	No. You couldn't play HDDVD's on an XBOX 360 with only an HDMI cable. If you really wanted to play those HD movies, then you'd need to purchase an XBOX 360 external HDDVD player, that is about 5"x5" disk drive that plugs into your XBOX 360. Your XBOX itself only has a DVD/CD drive, and is not factory equipped for HDDVD. You'd need the external player, which costs from $70-$200, if you search eBay, and retail stores sites.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	no no matter what you do the 360 will never play hddvd or blue ray you have to get a peripheral which is 200$ and most hddvd players are less than that now scince the format is dead.|`|J62umtpDaa	No, the xbox 360 only has a standard DVD player, it will not play HDDVDs regardless of what cabling you use.|`|ViUIOsEXaa	you need the hd dvd player add on.

s7Muujxzaa	>Any idea what this could be<<br>  <br>  Yes, I know exactly what your problem is. Now that you have Comcast, do realize that when you change channels, you change channels on the Comcast cable box and not on your TV? You should NEVER be changing channels on the TV again. <br>  <br>  When you have a cable box, all the interesting stuff is occurring in the cable box and your TV is connected to the cable box output through one of the TV's inputs and all you do is select the right input. Your TV is just acting as a display device.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you paid attention to how the cable box was connected to the TV. Now go back and connect it the same way. Look at the labeling near these jacks on the back of the TV and it should tell you what the input is. I suspect it will be something like component 1. Now you have to find your TV remote and there should be a buton there labeled INPUT. Cycle through that and see what you find.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that you will need to redo the TVs setup to tell it that you are now connected to cable, instead of an antenna.<br>  <br>  Ignore Gabriel's response as he has no clue what he is talking about.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	If your town gets Channel 3  then you set your tv to Channel 4 when you hook up the cable box.  Then leave that channel alone. Only change the cable box and watch to make sure that the remote is going to the box and not to the tv. The cable techs can help you over the phone to get it right..<br>  Otherwise your tv is dying..|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	You don't have cable at that outlet. You are getting ingress from broadcast channels  4&13.|`|1haOueFxaa	I might have an idea. The US is putting up a law that by 2009 every TV has to be cable or Satellite. No more antenna. Porbably the work their dong to shut down the OLD TVs is interfearing with your TV. I suggest you call your local cable company for help because im not a professional, Im just being skeptical.

5U1TTI7Taa	they're both really good phones. my boyfriend had a voyager for nearly a year, he just got rid of it two weeks ago when we got our iphones. but yeah he had no problems with it, he dropped it a lot and it hardly had a scratch, ect. it restarted if he typed too quickly or scrolled too quickly through pictures, though. my enV did the same thing. but aside from that, no complaints.<br>  <br>  that being said, i'd probably get the dare. better camera and it's better looking. i'm superficial, so that matters to me. regardless though, they're both really good phones. you might want to check cnet.com for reviews, they're unbiased and cover all of the bases. i check there before i buy any electronic.|`|YxCRA5N7aa	i think the lg dare well they r both in verizon|`|sXa1hRcfaa	unfortunately, neither of these phones even come close to the iPhone 3G, or the T-Mobile G1, but if I were to choose one I would go with the Voyager but the touchscreen sensitivity on both of these phones aren't nearly as good as the iPhone 3G|`|VoSy2sf2aa	<br>  Dare ?|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	I really like my Voyager, you should go with it, it's very user friendly|`|SjfC29fmaa	both are really hot phones|`|joPR3gP3aa	I would say the voyager only because of the qwerty keyboard but the dare is cool too. What I don't like about the voyager is how it is bigger because then it can only fit in big pockets and I wear skinny jeans which doesn't help all that much. I like the dare because it's a little smaller and has a few more capabilities but on the verizon wireless website the voyager is chepare but I love my voyager|`|MO4bBLkjaa	The voyager is crap. I had two, and both of them sucked, got rid of them in under like, 5 months. <br>  It randomly restarted, didn't send message, the touch screen was bad, etc. The only advantage it has to the Dare is the keyboard. <br>  The second one I got- they sent it to me with the front buttons falling off, the vibrate didn't work, and the screen would fall off randomly. Weird, right?<br>  But I've heard that the Dare is one of the best phones out there.<br>  Personally, I LOVE my Blitz. ^^|`|iYGs7lqfaa	i love answering this question i think that the dare is very bad i dont really like it i think you should get the voyager if you can i think that the dare is stupid i ex-specially like the voyager because it has mobile t.v so if you are on the train or on the bus you can watch live t.v and not miss an episode or if you don't have telvision it would be a great thing i would get the voyager if i was you |`|RRe69Sheaa	Ok my personal Pick would be the voyager, but there is a quicker way to answer your dilema go to this site called www.gsmarena.com.

Heres a website<br>  were people are fixing there own tv's,<a href="http://www.techlore.com/forums/70/Televisions-and-Projectors/threads" rel="nofollow">http://www.techlore.com/forums/70/Televi...</a>|`|qpP0ypVzaa	I assume it's not HD?  You have to weight your options, in my opinion.  HD is going to be cheaper in a few years if you can hold off but really you're looking at $440 to fix something or $1500-2000 to buy a nice 52" flat screen with all the bells and whistles.  I'm not a tv watcher as much as an audiophile but my brother has a new Samsung 50" and I'll tell you, there's nothing like it.<br>  <br>  So under the assumption it's a non-HD tv, you're stuck with $440 for fixing an old tv or 3-4 times that to buy a new equivalent in HD.  If you're rich, go for it.  If you're not, you may want to evaluate the piggy bank situation.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Do not fix.  I would have paid the money when this happened to me, but the repair comes with no warranty. In the old days, tv's lasted for 20 yeas. Now we get 3 years out of a modern tv.  www.HDGURU.com says our landfills will fill with newer tv's..
iimyRvAVaa	definitely buy the insurance.<br>  <br>  I am a huge Nikon fan, but the D90 was just prematurely forced onto the market, and will most likely have problems later on down the road.<br>  Those problems should be covered by Nikons warranty that they give you (like a year or something) but they can also say that whatever goes wrong is "User Error". <br>  Then you are out the money and the camera.<br>  <br>  I think %100 on the D90<br>  It may be expensive, but it would really suck for something to go wrong, or to have an accident with it.<br>  <br>  For the 18-200, the warranty is not so necessary.<br>  It is a good lens that has been around for a while now.<br>  I do reccomend, however, that you get a uv filter to protect the front element from scratches. also, keep the cap on when not in use.<br>  those front pieces of glass get scratched quite easily.<br>  <br>  |`|qIR9DB9Haa	Its up to you. I do not get extra warranties for my stuff, but I do have insurance for them. If you take care of your gear you should not have any problems that a regular warranty shouldnt cover. I use my camera all the time from from ski mountains to caves and I have never had any problems with it. Again though its up to you and whether or not you think you can take care of your stuff.|`|7qoyVAIjaa	I just bought a D90. I normally do NOT buy warranties but I did on the Nikon. For me the reason was that if you check out prices for cleaning, service, and repair on these cameras it will make your head spin. With this contract I can take my camera in for routine cleaning or service whenever I want. For me, that means whenever I get back from a beach or nature vacation I will have them get all teh dust, sand and salt out. One more thing... I dropped a cheap camera into a stream in Hawaii once (I slipped). If I do this with the Nikon I'll simply take it in and let them deal with it.|`|AA11300122	I believe the 18-200mm lense has a 5 years warranty on it.  Before you buy the camera from J&R, ask them to price match with other authorized Nikon dealers (Online).  Beachcamera.com has the D90 for about 888 dollars.  The lense is about 539 dollars.  If you ship the items to New Jersey, you save on tax!
AsQ0Awswaa	Hola, estoy estudiando para técnico de sonido, y te puedo contestar a esta pregunta.<br>  <br>  Tanto un micrófono como un altavoz son transductores.<br>  El micrófono es un transductor de entrada, ya que "entra" el sonido y es transformado a voltaje (según el tipo de micrófono, es convertido de una manera u otra, pero siempre el sonido es convertido a voltaje). El altavoz se encarga de hacer exactamente lo contrario pero con el mismo mecanismo, es decir, traduce el voltaje en sonido. Es un transductor de salida.<br>  <br>  Para explicarte el funcionamiento de un micrófono, he de explicarte qué es el sonido. Pues no es más que la vibración de partículas. Unas partículas chocan con otras, formando una onda que viene y va, la cual es captada por el oído humano.<br>  <br>  El micrófono funciona como tal gracias a una cápsula que incluye una membrana (llamada diafragma) que vibra cuando detecta ese movimiento de partículas. Mediante un mecanismo determinado, el micrófono convierte la presión sonora en diferencia de voltaje (más electrones o menos, según la intensidad del sonido recogido), que viaja a través del cable hasta la mesa de mezclas o el ordenador.<br>  <br>  Así pues, el altavoz hace exactamente lo contrario: el voltaje que le llega lo traduce a sonido. Al altavoz o parlante le llega voltaje, que mediante un sistema de electroimanes hace mover un cono hacia alante o hacia atrás, lo cual hace mover el aire en ondas que nuestro oído capta como sonido.<br>  <br>  De modo que un micrófono puede funcionar como altavoz y viceversa, ya que poseen el mismo sistema de transducción. Lo que determina que sea una cosa u otra es la dirección de la se?al, es decir, si lo conectas a una clavija de entrada (para grabar) o de salida (para escuchar).<br>  <br>  Obviamente, no esperes mucha calidad de un altavoz como micrófono (y al revés), ya que cada aparato está dise?ado para sus determinadas funciones.<br>  <br>  Espero haber resuelto tu duda. Un saludo.|`|a7cdc79caa03a2ea5ef69161b6a99c78aa	dios, he visto a elijah wood ahi y me ha dado un vuelco el corazon. no lo pongas q me pienso q eres el y me emociono, jajajaja.<br>  <br>  y no, lo q hay son auriculares con micro incorporado, pero lo tienes q comorar asi
