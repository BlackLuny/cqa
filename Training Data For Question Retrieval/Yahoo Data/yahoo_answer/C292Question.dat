Socially Inept (Towards Her)      Verse 1   I never know what to say to her,   Sometimes I think I seem gay to her,   And it’s hard to think when she’s near,   All of a sudden I get quiet with fear,   I never understood why I always run,   Or why I always get quiet in the middle of my fun,   But soon I’ll have my day,   Soon I’ll see the way,   I’m not sure about soon,   But I hope one time,   It could be now or later,   Hopefully at this time,   After this rhyme,   I be daydreaming about her,   My thoughts stay streaming about her,   My goal is to get excepted,   Just for once in my life be respected,   Wouldn’t that be nice?,   And I’m willing to pay almost any price,   I know I’m not the best guy,   And I don’t have enough money to even go to Best Buy,   But I won’t lie,   Rather than seeing her with someone else I’d rather die.      Chorus   This is social ineptitude,   If you take one brake; in crept the dude,   Looking for a feud,   Or it can be no one,   Man I’m paranoid,   My jealousy makes my thinking void.      This is social ineptitude,   If you take one brake; in crept the dude,   Looking for a feud,   Or it can be no one,   Man I’m paranoid,   My jealousy makes my thinking void.

20090222172424AAihiZ4	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Correct answer gets 10 points?	Once upon a time, there were three princes who wished to marry a princess. The princess wished to marry one of them, but not the other two. Her father however, was rather conservative, and did not feel she was ready to marry any of them. The King decided to put all three of them to tests that he believed none of them would be able to pass. First, he blindfolded them all, then led each in turn to his individual test.        The King led Prince #1 to the base of a mountain where there were ten painted, wooden doors, glistening in the sun. "All but one of these doors in front of you are white," said the King. "If you can tell me within the next ten minutes, which door is black, then you may marry my daughter. You may not speak to anyone, and you may not remove your blindfold."       The King led Prince #2 to a hillside, and pointed out across his lush green valleys to the edge of his kingdom, where ten beautiful buildings stood. "All but one of these buildings in front of you are white," the King said. "If you can tell me within the next ten minutes, which building is black, then you may marry my daughter. You may not speak to anyone, and you may not remove your blindfold."        The King led Prince #3 to a magnificent dining table where ten places were impeccably laid out. "All but one of the napkins on this table are white," said the King. "If you can tell me within the next ten minutes, which napkin is black, then you may marry my daughter. You may not speak to anyone, and you may not remove your blindfold."       Ten minutes later, only one of the princes - the one the princess wished to marry - had succeeded at his individual test. Which one of the princes had succeeded?        tell me how you have solved this question

It had like a techno ish vibe to it. There was a guy singing. There was also one of those crazy high pitched voices in parts of it, like what you hear when you speed up a tape recorder or something. It was a really short song, and I don't think there were that many words in it. Maybe a little. And it was a pretty short song..      I know thats totally vague, but if you have any ideas at all, it'll help.      Thanks!      Or maybe if anyone knows a site that has a list of songs that are played at forever 21?

20090222174340AAutamN	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why is everyone making a big deal about rihanna?	Many regular women are beaten far worse and have been for years.  Not to be harsh about what happened to her. No one knows if she hit him first or if he just beat her. I also feel sexism is an injustice to our society.  Everyone is saying "A MAN SHOULD NEVER HIT A WOMAN". I personally believe people should not hit people.  We live in a country where every year men are also victims of domestic violence. 835, 000 men per year. Does not include the ones who don't report the crime or hit back one time and are arrested.  5.3 women are victimized as a result of domestic violence. A much greater number than men ofcourse.  So many women/men have been stabbed, beaten with hammers and even killed as a result of this crime.  Why now when a celebrity is smacked around a few times is this such a big thing? To me, it's a smack in so many victims faces. Anyone else feels this way?

20090222184247AAktbI0	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Who Is Finding The Oscars Boring? I Am Extremely Bored Right Now. Are You?	I think that they are boring because of the 20 minute acceptance speeches. Also, this year I find them exceptionally boring because everything is nominated about 6 times, there aren't enough movies out, so each one got like a million nominees. So, therefore, every movie will basically be taking home an award. Who else thinks that they are bad this year?

20090222190117AA2wOKy	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: What would the music world look like today without MTV?	I want everyone's thoughts, to me, I think music in the mainstream would be much more creative and artistic.  To me, I think MTV kind of shoves their music down everyones throat telling society what music is "cool" and what music is "throw back cool" and so on, and so forth.  On the other hand, Music videos would seem much more boring than they already were.        Well, those are my 2 cents.. how about you?

20090222190725AADPAzl	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: This or That: Melodic Death Metal- Part Three?	NOTE: This is a repost since the first time I posted, I didn't receive a lot of responses.      Tonight's choices stray away from the mainstream for the most part.       Choice one is a particular favorite track of mine from the band. Coming from the "doomy side" of melodeath, the first choice is Insomnium's 'Mortal Share'.       The second choice is a band fairly new to me, they've grown on me. They have almost a metalcore/power metal vibe to them (in terms of the riffs and the almost atmospheric sound they acheive). Reigning from Italy, the second choice is Disarmonia Mundi's 'Red Clouds'.      Insomnium    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5IpHczLe...       Disarmonia Mundi    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDgEB5MNu...       Which song do you prefer?
20090222191100AATfBlU	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Y&R - Phyllis Haters, what do you think of Michelle Stafford as an actress?	What drew me to the character of Phyllis was the way that Michelle Stafford portrays her.  Anyone who has seen Phyllis in action, whether you love her or hate her, you cannot deny that Michelle Stafford has such amazing acting talent, as evidenced when she confronted Nick at Restless Style about his philandering with Sharon.      On the CBS message boards about this show, there is a slew of rabid haters who put down an make fun of MS's looks and acting ability, and disguise as bashing of Phyllis.  This is the one thing that has driven me away from those boards, as I couldn't stand to read about poor Michelle getting trashed just for getting involved on Y&R.  It is sickening.      Before I started watching Y&R full-time, I first saw MS as bachelor auction bidder Suzanne Monroe in the Ashley Judd movie "Double Jeopardy."  She was so convincing with her accent, I thought she DID grow up in New Orleans until I learned she was actually born in Chicago... LOL!  Go to her personal website at  http://www.michellestafford.com/  click on Videos, and watch her acting talents shine in various clips of her movies and TV projects, and see how her ability shines.      I have e-mailed with one non-Phyllis fan, Cheetah_K, and she has said that she would never say anything bad about the actress.  Not to point fingers or accuse or bash (I'm not looking to get reported here) but I wonder how many other Phyllis haters would have that same class and decency.

If you too believe we have the potential of taking it to the big leagues (music industry) and are willing to help out the band in anyway, that would be AWESOME, plus you wouldn't have to do that much and would also take fame with you and will also be noticed for being the bands coordinator.  You don't need to meetup with us or anything like that so don't worry, all you need is a MYSPACE and MOTIVATION.  Basically by helping make our page, getting people to notice us (a lot of adds), and advice for the music we make.  ADDITIONALLY, IF YOU HELP OUT YOU WILL BE A TOP FRIEND, BE ABLE TO GET FREE CLOTHING, YES WE ARE GOING TO GET HOOKED UP WITH A CLOTHING LINE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS FROM MY BROTHER, BASICALLY SOME FREE SWEATSHIRTS, SHIRTS, AND HATS.  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED EITHER REPLY SAYING YOU ARE AND GIVE US A GOOD REASON TO TRUST YOU, AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

I keep catching hot glares   Can't call it, I'm like Dana Dane having nightmares   But I'm awake; I can't shake or break it   Guess my only option left, is to take it            I'm tired of them trying boast and brag; they can get toast and lag   Dipped in hot coffee and just mostly sag   Took the bag, and up the sleeve I got mad tricks   Houdini style disappear quick like magic   Shakespearean plays I'm tragic   And my thoughts are way too deep to imagine   It's not all the same, I hit the streets no hesitation like David Blaine   Take a look at my feet that's levitation   Magnetic style, out the station with the new school, any old tracks erasing   I'm pacing, hitting more threes than Reggie in Indiana   Never forgetting me, I'm not a one hit wonder like the hammer   But I will hand ya, more L's than Big, not a friend of me   I'm platinum plus, you're the enemy    I pack the tonic so bionic it's kind of ironic    How my skills just slag like Ebonics, Whoa    Then I start the show here we go         You can catch a freeze from you hero    With ease, on moral combat I'm sub zero   I begin with a fatal style I'm going to win   At the end they yell flawless victory, finish him   But I don't think it's over just yet, I'm to set   To wet, I leak more songs than the internet   Then I return to sender, no surrender   Get it southern fried, copped and skewed like a blender   In a stick now this is how they use him dumb   It gets written, bite, chewed, and spit like gum   Picked up then ABC style's how the selling me   You're telling me, they reciting my words like a spelling bee   But, they need to get off my dick, they don't own me   I'm alone see I've been playing on stations before Sony   For real

20090222205715AAidXEf	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	RHH: Question for the fellas...?	Is there something that bothers you about WOMEN into the hip hop scene? I do a lot of journalism, developing and major studies about hip hop pioneers. I travel a lot with up and comming artist and do major promoting... but when I'm around I get the vibe like I don't belong there. My suggestions and opinions never really matter.    I'm not complaining or anything, I just thought I would ask so I could realize that maybe there is another surrounding I can vibe with.       (I'm not talking about artist in particular, but the women behind the music ie: publicist etc...)      ***If you cant answer the question maturely, don't answer at all.   Peace and thanks...

Ok this question has probably been asked before, but what do you think Meryl Streep's character meant at the end of the film when she said "I have doubts"?       I thought at first that what she meant was she had doubts about whether or not Flynn was guilty, and whether or not she should have lied. But then I read some reviews in which people thought that she was saying she had doubts about her faith, because if there was a God, would he allow such a man to be "promoted" after doing what she thinks he did?       What do you think the comment was referring to?

Just kidding guys, but since I got your attention...      Do you feel like Bass players never get enough credit in a band?  it always seems its about the guitar player and the vocals, with the drummer coming in 2nd... but the poor bass player never gets credit, most people when asked whos favorite bass player just say Flea!  He is a good bass player, but I don't think he is true to what a bass player is, I think slapping is the same thing as tapping in guitar, it may look hard at first, but its more of a show off mechanic that is easy once learned.      So what are your thoughts on bass players?

Some of my most embarrassing moments (there are a lot) are:      ~ripping my pants in front of many people (many diff. times too)   ~being dared to streak down my street at night was pretty embarrassing   ~fighting with my friend in the mall! she pants'd me at the main door of the mall. So to get even, I pants'd her by the fountain. Except, she fell in and got soaked. Then she pulled me in, and we kinda got in trouble. A lot of trouble, lol.   ~loosing a bet, and having to pass out flyers of myself (really embarrassing ones) at Wal*Mart.  Things like me first waking up in the morning, sneezing, getting pants'd, tripping, and generally embarrassing, bad pictures of myself   ~going down the water slide at Sea World and not only loosing my top, but the bottoms too! They had to stop the ride until I found it and I had to try and put it back on under water! people were starring and taking pictures... not kewl.   ~falling asleep at a party... Never do It! They went easy on my, but my friends covered every visible inch of my body with writing and pictures i permanent marker! It was there for like 3 days...       for the record on parties... my friends rule is: if you fall asleep you are FAIR GAME! We took a precision shaver and wrote our names on the back of John's head once, and gave Adam a reversed Mohawk!        ~let's see... truth or dare brings back a lot of good times and bad ones for me... I've only backed down from 5 dares in my life so far... because I didn't want to die, get arrested, or other reasons. Okay... here we go...      ~I've stood on the corner with a sign that says honk if you think I'm retarded and had to keep track of the honks... over 2,000 and I was only there for 30min.   ~I've flashed a cop while on my bike. I didn't get into trouble because I was lucky (and fast).   ~I was going to ask out this really hot guy. Unknowingly, my so called friends made a list of embarrassing moments and habits and wrote them on my forehead while I was sleeping!   ~I was dared to call this guy I like and as soon as he picked up... tell him I love him, I think he's really hot, and ask if he would go on a date with me! His mom answered... yeah.. uh, awkward!   ~I once had to give a speech in front of the school (not my type of thing) and was nervous. My friends said to just chug some Faygo and get it out of my system. The soda helped... until I opened my mouth to talk and belched into the microphone. It lasted for like 7secs. Everyone in the auditorium laughed... including the teachers.   ~falling and tripping up the stairs, this year. I'm going up the stairs to my English class and tripp up the stair. I didn't just fall, but managed to roll up like 5 stairs. How does that even happen?         Give me some stars if you want me to post more...

He went to the local technical college, signed up for evening classes, attended diligently, and learned all he could when the time of the practical exam approached, the gynecologist prepared carefully for weeks, and completed the exam with tremendous  skill.    When the results came back, he was surprised to find that he had obtained a score of 150%.    Fearing an error, he called the Instructor, Saying, "I don't want to appear ungrateful for such an outstanding result, but I wonder if there is an error in the grade.

You put the engine back together again perfectly, which is also worth 50% of the mark."         After a pause, the instructor added, "I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I've never seen done in my entire career"

20090222194424AA7TAwc	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Anybody have any idea one WHERE or HOW I can see what these two pictures are supposed to be?? (manga covers)?	Erm...I was going around google looking up something in the vein of "controversial mangas".       I ran into this incredibly fundamentalist american site that talks about comic books...ya know, the sites that talks about comics, and talks trash about stuff they dont like, and Gunsmith Cats were featured during some points....anyways, I clicked one of the links about Gunsmith Cats...       http://manstreamcomics.livejournal.com/1...        The person who wrote that article included TWO images of the series's covers. One of them sounds like its supposed to be a typical loli-bait cover...probably a suggestive girl holding a gun or something, and the second one below is supposed to be SOMETHING appalling, disgusting, pedo-bait, unamerican, etc. etc.       Only problem is, when I went to that link, the images DONT show up for me! When I clicked the Show Pictures, it also doesn't work. Anyways...normally I wont be too obsessed with seeing those kind of images...but when I read the COMMENTS that were below the images from the people in that site...they threw all sorts of trash, saying its evil etc., and from past-experience with sites like these, all this negativity from THOSE kind of people will instantly mean it "WILL be something that I will love!"       http://manstreamcomics.livejournal.com/1...        sooo....does ANYONE know what those two images are supposed to be?? All those hate from those people really piqued my interest....here is all the information I can gather from the comments about the two images...      -The first one is tamer then the second one below   -the second one is upskirt   -they both feature girls and guns   -there is possibly a cameltoe under the pantyhoes of the girl in second image   -I THINK they are both supposed to be manga covers, the first one certainly is   -the image of the girl's are probably lolis, but since it's licensed by a company in America (ironic huh?), it's legal.   -Gunsmith Cats       So anyone seen this series before have any ideas what the images might be ??(yeah, I know, I posted the link 2 times...)

I'm going to be a freshman soon, and I'm not very good at sports, so I am learning to play the guitar right now. However, I also want to be able to sing, so that when I start my own band in High School, I can be the lead singer/guitarist. Therefore, I would have to be a really good singer and guitarist.       Problem: I cannot sing to save my life.   I'm too shy to sing in front of strangers, but I have heard myself sing, and it's not too appealing. It's not terrible, but it isn't descent either. So, what should I do?      Do guys take singing lessons, or is that kind of a girl thing.?   Should I just give up on being the singer and settle with just playing the guitar?      Thanks for all your answers

I'm only 13, I've got more than enough to worry about already!      So here you wonderful, yahoo answers users go:-)       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoUi1tsrc...       enjoy:)

20090222192440AA5Jxh2	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Is this song any good?	I've written songs before, but this one I'm unsure about.    There's a certain someone I am currently head over heels for, and I think he doesn't feel the same way about me, so I feel pathetic for even trying.      I've hit rock bottom   because I'm a pathetic excuse for a person   that you could be into.   All the chances   will never be.   I must be mistaken   for what I'm seeing just can't be,   no, it just can't.      CHORUS:   Take my dreams   out from under my feet   that can't keep me up,   when you're next to me.   And it seems,   that I'm a mess,   for feeling this way.      I'm head   over heels for you boy,    and that's the reason,   that I'm tounge-tied right now.   And my mouth   is glued shut when you're around.   I know that I'm being rather pathetic right now.      CHORUS      I'm sure I'm dreaming   when my heart's just beating out of my chest.   And I know I'll be waiting for a while.   And You've been on my mind since the 13th of December   and I'm wasting my time on you.

I want to try out for American Idol, but I've known people to go there and not make it who sing better than I do in my perspective. I'm not a very intelligent person. I'm in high school and passing by the skin of my teeth. I don't know if i could make it in the music industry. I've sang in front of large crowds of people before and they all have told me that I was an amazing singer. I'm not sure that I'm as good as everyone thinks I am. I need help with my situation.....I really don't know what to do.

20090222211932AAVNYyR	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What Metal Bands would I like?	I love bands like Cradle Of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, Ancient (with Lord Kaiphas),The Kovenant (Animitronic era), Acid Bath, My Dying Bride, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, stuff like that. I guess it's considered "Symphonic Metal," or whatever you call it. I'm not really into Death Metal like Cannibal Corpse and such. I like stuff that's heavy but catchy or dark but beautiful, with keyboards or orchestras or female backing vocalists or just something other than the typical vocalist/screamer,guitar,bass,drums set-up. Does anyone know any bands who sound similar to any of these, mainly Cradle and Dimmu? Any suggestions welcome. We have no music stores around here anymore so I have to buy my CDs at Wal-Mart and Best Buy and MTV doesn't show Metal videos anymore, so I don't even know who's out there anymore. But if anyone has any suggestions, I'll look them up on YouTube and if I like it, I'll get their CD on Amazon. At least they still have good music.

I'm thinking about watching the series first, then the movie, so i can see the beginning of everything first, but I don't know, I guess they defeat Bison in both the series and the movie (DON'T SPOIL ANYTHING) so I don't know.

20090222210221AAz91X9	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	What can I do with all of this spare time?	Recently I started going to an independent study high school along with some college classes. This school only takes up a small portion of my week. the reason for making this transition was because i was going through bad time in my life involving depression and major anxiety disorders. i cannot handle taking more classes because im afraid that it will happen again. i am working on finding a job too. but in my spare time i have realized that it is making more depressed. Independent study works for me in the sense that there is less school work. i feel dependent on talking to this guy that im sorta with and also my friends. i dont want to irritate them by always wanting to talk in my spare time. so what are things i can do to keep myself busy so i dont think about this stuff or feel the need to talk to someone. i am making a planner to fill in all of my empty hours, but i dont know what else to put there with out a job.
