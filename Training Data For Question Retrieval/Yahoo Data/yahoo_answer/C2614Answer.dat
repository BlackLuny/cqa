pLsuy4otaa	scusa...ma se è un boeing non può essere un airbus!<br>  La Boeing è americana ed il 747 è un aereo molto grande e confortevole per i voli intercontinentali.<br>  La Airbus è europea e per i voli intercontinentali le compagnie aeree che annoverano gli airbus nella loro flotta utilizzano gli  A330 o gli A340 ed il nuovo A380, che in generale rispetto ai boeing sono aerei più nuovi e più evoluti in termini di elettronica.<br>  Comunque vai tranquillo è un aereo sicurissimo e confortevole.|`|vC3sSEP2aa	un Boeing-Airbus? è come se Microsoft si fondesse con la Apple....=)<br>  gran bell'aereo il 747 (boeing)... buon volo|`|aZLRK7gTaa	Il Boeing (non Boing) 747 è decisamente più famoso con il nomignolo Jumbo Jet è stato fino a poco tempo fa l'aereo passeggeri più grande del mondo. E' un aereo di vecchia concezione, ma assolutamente sicuro e performante, molto adatto al lungo raggio. E' senza dubbio un aereo esteticamente bellissimo anche negli interni, ma il concetto di comodità è molto relativo. In prima classe è logico che stai comodo. In economica ti tocca il sedile modello carro bestiame e paralisi agli arti inferiori. Purtroppo è così un pò su tutti gli aerei, anche quelli più moderni.|`|cQlTEGG2aa	Il buon vecchio 747 è in produzione dal '69, quindi ti puoi strafidare. L'ho preso molte volte ed è assolutamente sicuro, oltre che essere una bella macchina. Se voli con un Airbus può capitarti un A330 o A340, ma poco cambia. Piuttosto spera di volare sui 747-400, perchè in un volo "interno" (Parigi-Guadalupa) sono capitato su un 747-300 "Carro Bestiame Edition"... un dramma.

Some throttle bodies are connected to the Transmission via a transmission valve. This valve is a plunger type valve that if it binds could cause a stone hard feeling on the accelerator pedal.  Check the linkage on the tranny make sure there are no obstructions. Replace any weak springs, broken or bent plastic fittings etc.  Next adjust your transmission valve cable according to your repair manual.|`|AA10750829	Not to alarm you but especially on a Toyota the throttle cable (gas pedal cable) sometimes one little strand of the cable will break causing this problem I usually repair this myself; check with your local mechanic to see if it is frayed.

They might offer to forgive part of the loan or reduce the monthly payment.  But be careful what adjustment you agree to.

The dealer has to abide by the laws and if he isn't he needs to be reported.  He makes other dealers look bad.  <br>  Ask for a supervisor at the DMV and tell them  you want to file a complaint on him.  Ask them if this has to be done in person or can you do it online.  All State offices are run different, so to save you time, find out if you have to do it in person or not.

gEw83TRTaa	NO NO NO NO NO<br>  <br>  people - There is NO cooling off period to unwind a car purchase.  Period.  None.  The mythical three days is not there, the absurd 30 days is not there either.  Once ink is on contract you own a car.  <br>  <br>  The only exception is in CA, where you may *purchase* a three-day unwind contract.  But that is only in one state, and its a priveledge you pay for, not automatic or law.<br>  <br>  Some dealers have their own internal policy regarding return and re-contracting a car.  However that is on the dealer level and not madated or regulated by any body.<br>  <br>  I find it hard to believe that your car was missing a clutch witch though.  If that were the case, it would have never been driven.  Not off the truck, or on a test drive.  So there is something not right about that.  It may have gone defective, it may be another problem.  But if it were missing altogether, you would have never been able to start the car.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT - yes, you are right, its a safety issue.  But its not something you get to unwind a car deal for.  They have the right to fix it under warranty.  If for some reason it cannot be repaired, then they will put you in a different car.  However, all the cards are in their hands.|`|hXFndli2aa	read the contract that you signed when you bought the car and check if there is a cooling off period meaning you can return the car if you change your mind in 2 weeks, some states don't have this cooling off period. If you bought your car defective take it back to the dealer and tell em whats up, every car comes with manufacturer warranty. They should be able to fix or give you another car, with the financial crisis the world is going thru i doubt that the dealer will just cancel the contract with you they need the money. GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  Don't believe every thing the sales man tells you question him/her|`|mwu6aJuyaa	OK a few things, 1, it's brand new, it has warranty, get the dealer to fix it.<br>  <br>  2. If it doesn't have that part, how did you ever start the car to get it to the shop where it currently is? would it not still be at the dealers? If it's still at the dealers then this shouldn't be a problem, it's under warranty and hasn't even left the lot yet.<br>  <br>  3. why would you ever take a NEW car to anywhere else but the dealer that you got it from?|`|TbiSBXclaa	There is no LAW.   The car has a manufacturers defect and there is nothing illegal about that.<br>  <br>  It's a brand new car, still under warranty. The dealership is obligated to fix it for free. Beyond that, you have no recourse. <br>  <br>  If the issue persists then it may qualify under the Lemon Laws but it has to be the same problem repeatedly.|`|fd7190dbf41367abef107c3ae34b04cbaa	usually with a brand new car to return no questions ask is a 3 day grace period  in fl i just dont know check your contract   but it sounds like a mistake if you like the car and the dealer wants to fix it then you may just want to do that but check the consumer agency by the state of fl and ask  the state usually has a grace period for new car purchases good luck|`|hCfjvfswaa	There is a 'no cooling period' once you buy the car meaning it cannot be returned unless it's a lemon, meaning the car is defective when you purchased it.

Your car is covered under bumper to bumper warranty so its fine not all cars are perfect some do come with defects. If anything just ask for a loaner car until your car is fixed. The dealership will not take it back and if you go in there demanding them to give you your money back they will less likely help you out. You test drove it, you checked it out, you took it home. It is now your car and there is nothing you can do about it.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Let'em fix the car and calm down.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a cooling off period when buying cars.  None!<br>  <br>  Enjoy!<br>  <br>  <br>  Consumer Smarts: Myth of the cooling-off period<br>  <br>  Tuesday, November 6, 2007<br>  Last updated 8:19 a.m. PT<br>  <br>  By PHUONG CAT LE<br>  P-I REPORTER<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, Washington law doesn't allow a blanket three-day "cooling-off" period once you've signed a contract to buy a car or other major purchase. I often hear from readers who wrongly believe they have three days to change their minds and they're disappointed to learn this isn't true.<br>  <br>  Q: So when can you get out of a contract?<br>  <br>  A: State and federal laws give you the right to cancel contracts in very limited circumstances, including door-to-door sales, timeshares, business opportunities, credit-repair firms and health clubs.<br>  <br>  But there is no "cooling-off" period for automobile purchases or leases.<br>  <br>  "That's the biggest myth in the car business," said Doug Walsh, chief of the consumer protection division of the Attorney General's Office. "They think they can get out of a major purchase."<br>  <br>  Walsh advises not signing a contract until you read it, understand it and agree to it.<br>  <br>  Once you sign an agreement, you are legally bound. Have a clear understanding of what you're buying and be sure you read any contract carefully before signing it, he said.<br>  <br>  According to the Attorney General's Office, consumers have the right to cancel a contract in these specific cases:<br>  <br>  # Membership contract with a health club: three business days from signing to get a refund.<br>  <br>  # Timeshare purchase: seven business days after signing the contract or after receiving the state-required disclosures about the timeshare, whichever comes later.<br>  <br>  # Door-to-door sales and sales at home shows, expos and seminars: three business days on sales of more than $25. Examples include sales at a seminar in a hotel banquet room or a sales party at someone's house.<br>  <br>  # Retail purchases involving payments made in installments: three business days. Common examples are vacuum cleaners and magazine subscriptions. This state law applies if the contract was made away from the seller's usual place of business or by commercial telephone solicitation.<br>  <br>  # Telemarketing sales: within three business days of getting written confirmation (a sale isn't final until you get it in writing). The written confirmation should explain how to cancel and provide an address to send your cancellation notice. You also can cancel if you don't get the item within 42 calendar days.<br>  <br>  # Contracts with credit-repair companies: five business days from signing it.<br>  <br>  # Home-equity loans or lines of credit: The federal Truth in Lending Act gives borrowers three business days after signing a contract to walk away from a loan without paying a penalty. This cancellation right applies when you use your home to guarantee repayment for a personal loan. It doesn't apply on loans to buy or build your principal home, if you refinance your loan with the same lender or if you're borrowing from a state agency. You have until midnight of the third business day to cancel the credit transaction, according to the Federal Trade Commission. If you decide to back out, you must notify your creditor in writing.<br>  <br>  # Hearing aids: within 30 calendar days of delivery for reasonable cause, and not merely because you've changed your mind.<br>  <br>  # Business opportunities that let you start a business through the purchase or leasing of equipment: seven business days; does not apply to franchises.<br>  <br>  # Memberships to camping clubs: three days to cancel, but you get six days if you didn't get a chance to inspect the camping club facilities first.<br>  <br>  # Private vocational schools that don't grant degrees: five days to cancel and get your money back in full if you haven't started your training.<br>  <br>  To cancel a contract, the Attorney General's Office recommends that you write a letter to the company explaining that you want to cancel the purchase and keep a copy for your records. Mail the letter by certified mail and request a return receipt.|`|L9LkdThjaa	crazyscool- is once again completely wrong.  You can not return any car, new or used.<br>  <br>  This link is right out the state that enforces the laws.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1214213334482&pagename=Rev-Enforcement%2FRELayout" rel="nofollow">http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?c=P...</a><br>  <br>  Consistant in every state.<br>  <br>  Q.  Do I have 72 hours to change my mind after I purchase a motor vehicle/powersports vehicle? <br>  A. NO. The right to rescind does not cover motor vehicles/powersports vehicles purchased at a dealership. Once you sign a buyer's order and the appropriate forms required by law, you have bought a motor vehicle/powersports vehicle. <br>  <br>  This is consistent in every state except California.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	No, there is no right of rescission or cooling-off law in regards to vehicle sales.<br>  <br>  Crazyscool - Sorry, you are incorrect. Vehicle sales (whether through a dealer or private party) are NOT bound by any cooling-off law. I dealt with this daily for years. It is a common misconception. It has been brought up many times on here, and nobody can prove it. Other contracts are indeed applicable, but not vehicle sales. <br>  <br>  California does provide a "3-day" clause on new vehicle sales, but it is fee-based and must be purchased at point-of-sale.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	There is no law that gives a buyer the right to return a car after they've purchased it. Doesn't matter if the car is new or used. Car sales are always final.<br>  <br>  In California, you can purchase the option to return a used car within a specific amount of time. That's in California only.<br>  <br>  Whoever said you have 30 days to return it is an imbecile.|`|AA11997985	Sorry, there are NO RETURNS! There is no federal law requiring a car dealer or a person selling a car to take a car back. The only exceptions are certain transactions in California that are covered by the California Car Buyers Bill of Rights or where the dealer voluntarily offers to take a car back.   Dealers may describe the right to cancel as a "cooling-off" period, a money-back guarantee or a "no questions asked" return policy. Before you purchase from a dealer, ask about the dealer's return policy, get it in writing in the contract and read it carefully.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/car-return" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/car-return</a> <br>  <a href="http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/billrights_top.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/billrights_top.ht...</a>|`|2hl89HUeaa	Check Your sales contract.

uy4k4OlNaa	Vauxhall VXR8.  The Mustang only comes in left hand drive in the UK right?  Plus, the VXR8 is more reliable and is easier to service than the Mustang.  Unless you do like the Mustang, that's fine.  It's not bad, its just the VXR8 is better.  It will sure turn more heads than the VXR8.  <br>  I am American and I would recommend the Vauxhall VXR8.  The Mustang used to be very popular over here but I hardly see any anymore.  The Mustangs I do see are all V6 Mustangs so there probably is something wrong with the GT Mustang, which has a V8.  It's the character of the car that makes it sell over here.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Vauxhall.<br>  <br>  10 times more fun to drive than the Mustang.<br>  <br>  I am American.<br>  <br>  Also, the Mustang is known for breaking down a lot and having a poor resale value.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	I'm not a fan of Holden, but the VXR8 is a brilliant car. 10 times the car the Mustang SHOULD be really. It's also technically a HSV, which means it's supercharged to give it more beans and Magnetic Ride Control ala Audi TT for a smoother ride. I wouldn't have a holden, but I'd definitely have an HSV. Definitely the VXR8. The Mustang is exactly like it's older brothers which in this day and age is a bad thing. Horrible to drive, weedy V6 and shoddy suspension. The VXR8 is much more refined, but as The Stig can prove it can still pull sweet slides.

AITKiXwUaa	I actually had the same problem for awhile because my dad died in a car accident.  I got over it by taking drivers ed again, strange as that may sound.  If you're having full blown panic attacks though, you should NOT be driving.  Driving while panicked is just as bad as driving while angry.  You loose all control of your own actions because your reason is overtaken by your emotions.  If something did happen that required you to react quickly, you would be helpless.  It is probably impossible to fully avoid cars and such for any long period of time, but I think most people feel the same way after an accident, so if you stay away from them for awhile it could help.  Maybe you could try bikeing?  It's not great for terribly long distances, or if you're in a hurry, but it could help you get used to being around cars.|`|nRSjUKJZaa	I can relate to what your talking about. In Nov 2001 I was in a really bad accident I got hit head on by a truck, it was very scary. <br>  <br>  For quite some time I was pretty scared to being driving  a car and even more scared when I was in a car with someone else driving. <br>  <br>  The best way to overcome the fear of it is to just get out on the road, after time it will subside and you wont be as fearful to be out on the roads again. <br>  <br>  It is okay to be a cautious driver but being too cautious can sometimes be more damaging then not being cautious. <br>  <br>  Give it time and it will be okay. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Read this site its very informative........<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/990800ap/990800c.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aafp.org/afp/990800ap/990800c...</a>|`|LIxpXTnLaa	i don't know, but when you act like that, you put yourself and everyone else in the car and on the road around you in MORE danger. having a maniac sitting beside you is not good. you seriously need to stop it. you are a distraction to the driver.|`|W3KqA9t1aa	Same problem here. After my last accident I was too afraid to even get into the ambulance. I just had the attemdant hold the transfusion bottle out the back door whilst I crawled 4 miles to the Hospital.|`|f915b96cf0e8a3afb012b1b833b05df8aa	grow up<|`|erhdsNHHaa	Aw hun that is totally normal.  It's in your head now and you're scared it will happen again, it's understandable.  The best thing to do is to just keep driving.  Otherwise you won't ever want to drive again, but you have to push yourself and show yourself you can do it.  <br>  <br>  I hit a deer once, and I'm STILL terrified of driving at night on the highway.  Every time I see a deer on the side of the road I still get really scared because it brings back the memories of my accident. <br>  Don't worry though you'll feel better about driving after you do it for a little while again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|K4KBQEEVaa	well, if i was you, i wouldn't want to if i got seriously hurt, but its been long enough, you should try putting it behind you now.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	What you're experiencing sounds pretty normal if you were in a bad car accident, especially if you or someone else in the car got seriously injured.  Sounds like you might be experiencing something similar to PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).  It's natural to be afraid of things that have hurt you in the past but it's not natural to have debilitating panic attacks.<br>  <br>  To get past an intense fear so you can do things like ride in a car without experiencing a panic attack etc., it's probably best to seek professional help in the form of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.  They can help you work through why you're so scared and hopefully help you get past the fear so you can function again.
HBx6q05Oaa	I would check local salvage yards. This will save you a ton of money, or Ebay for a good used part
fwtJAsZSaa	The engine has a very narrow range of speeds(0-5000,6000RPM) etc. So you need to reduce and multiply the torque produced by the engine. This  is accomplished through the gears in the transmission. If the engine were directly connected to the wheels (without any transmission) there would be no control over the vehicle as it would be difficult to keep the car stationary(the wheels would always be spinning.) So you need a clutch(manual transmission) or torque converter(automatic transmission) to disconnect the engine from the driving wheels when the car has to be stationary.The first gear has a high gear ratio to allow the car to get off gently off from standstill by reducing torque produced by the engine.The next gear performs another gear reduction and after that the remaining gears perform torque multiplication(wheels spin at the same speed as the engine or faster than the engine speed). The purpose of torque multiplication is to get better fuel economy as for little effort in the engine you get  more speed in the driving wheels.<br>  hope this helps.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	A transmission allows you to maintain the proper drive ratio (speed of the engine in relation to the speed of the wheels). In a manual transmission vehicle, the driver selects the ratio. In an automatic transmission vehicle, it selects the ratio for you, but it allows the driver to override it.|`|AA10191024	Without a transmission, you have direct drive, which is impossible to start out in. Try putting your manual trans in 4th or 5th gear (same as direct drive) and try to start moving. VERY difficult.<br>  <br>  The transmission allows you to get the car moving before going to the direct, non-gear-reduction drive.|`|l30fX3Ppaa	the purpose of transmission is to transmit the power from the engine to the wheels.. in order to get the vehicle going you need a mix of TORQUE and POWER..<br>  without the transmission the raw power from the engine is not sufficient to move the vehicle.. the transmission coverts the power from engine to higher torque in 1st gear to move the vehicle initially and the 5th or 6th gears multiply the power thereby propelling the vehicle to higher speed.. the s a gradual conversion from torque to power while using 1st - 5th gear..|`|hD25pT1Laa	A transmission is necessary due to the nature of the internal combustion engine. They only produce usable power over a relatively narrow RPM range. Without being able to select different gear ratios with the transmission, your car would either take off from a stop well, but only go 20 MPH, or it would be able to run 100 MPH but would take 10 minutes to get up to that speed. The selectable gear ratios keep the engine running in the RPM range where it is able to produce it's best power in several speed ranges.|`|r1rXE6Gtaa	It "transmits" the mechanical energy of the engine to the wheels.|`|l8zIak9Saa	None can acieve it's aim without a stated MISSION . Auto has therefore a has a TRANS ( PORTING ) MISSION .|`|K4KBQEEVaa	the transmission is the main thing connecting the engine to the drive shaft which connects to the drive axle. The transmission also gives the vehicle its gears (reverse, drive, etc) so if you loss your transmission, your car is just a 3,000lb paper weight.|`|7COHH5luaa	HI, TRANSMISSION MEAN- TRANSFER OF ENERGY FROM BURNING FUEL- MOVEMENT OF PISTON-ROTATING OF CRANK-ROTATING OF GEARS WHICH MAKE AUTO IN MOBILE STATE SO IF THERE IS NO TRANSMISSION OF THESE STATES AUTO WILL NOT BE TO SAY AUTOMOBILE

gstBWswfaa	try like 2 high output alternators? :-P<br>  and were talking 280-300 amps a peice|`|9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	No, not even close.  You will need a much bigger alternator then one that is 100A.<br>  <br>  One question for you, why are you getting 4 PDX-1.1000 when the Type-X is only 1000w RMS.  You would only need two of those amps to fully power the Type-Xs.  You should only use one of those amps per sub.  <br>  <br>  To give you an idea of how much power you need...<br>  Four PDX-1.1000 will output 1000w RMS.  1000w x 4 amps = 4000w RMS output.<br>  4000w output / 0.8 (80% efficient amp (class D)) = 5000w input<br>  So you need to give those amps 5000 watts of input to fully power your amps.<br>  5000w / 14.4 (running voltage of car) = 350A<br>  That means you need 350 amps just to power your four PDX amplifiers.<br>  <br>  Once you include your car's required amperage to do it's normal duties you will be close to a 400-450A alternator.  That means you will need to look for an alternator around 450A to fully power your system.  You also need one that has a high output at low RPMs.  That means you need the alternator  to create a lot of power when your car is idling.<br>  <br>  If you have two amps you will be closer to 300A or so.  <br>  <br>  Either way you can tell a 100A alternator is nowhere close to being sufficient at powering your system.<br>  <a href="http://www.highoutputalternator.com/TechCalcs/alternatorcurrentratingcalculator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.highoutputalternator.com/Tech...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!
qV8Vz36Iaa	Yes. According to the experts I know. The demolition of the twin towers and World Trade Center 7 on 9/11/2001 was a planned demolition staged to look like a 'collapse' after airplane impacts on the twin towers.<br>  <br>  There is residue from thermate, pulverized concrete, symmetrical collapse, timed explosions, no resistance to fall. All of this evidence contradicts the Bush 9/11 Commission Report. The Commission conveniently denied the existence of the steel core of WTC1 and WTC2. Most of the facts remain shrouded in mystery including the identities of hijackers.<br>  <br>  You see, over half the suicide hijackers who supposedly died in the airplane crashes have come forward to provide interviews after 9/11. The list of hijackers has never been revised.|`|o3Z0Xrjsaa	Yes it was pre planed by the US Government and Military using remote control technology. There is a system that can over-ride the actions of a pilot if there is a hijacking were the plane can be landed or crashed as like on September 11, 2001. Plus the idea of flying planes in to buildings has been around since 1960 when the War Hawks in Kennedy's presidency wanted war with Cuba to oust Castro and one idea was to fly planes in to buildings and blame it on Cuban terrorists. This never happened but came close. This was Called: Operation Northwoods. <br>  Crashing planes into the towers is INSIDE JOB on 11, Sep 2001. Not the work of some non flying dopes. The Towers have been around since 1973 and never hit before 11, September 2001 then all the sudden their hit strange or what?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com./WRHARTICLES/northwoods.html?q=northwoods.html" rel="nofollow">http://whatreallyhappened.com./WRHARTICL...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_N...</a>|`|dWLgwb3baa	If you are talking about the attack on New York City and Washington DC on September 11, 2001, yes.  There was no coincidence about any of that.|`|YluXks4baa	yeah, pretty obvious. stupid damn terrorists!
FsT54qh1aa	Sorry, but leaks in the sidewall can not safely be repaired. Only leaks in the tread area can be. You need at least one new tire. Preferably the same brand\model of what you have on the rest of the car. If the tread on all of them is pretty worn out already, just get an entire new set.|`|XR3SPPCVaa	sorry buddy you can't fix a hole in the side wall of the tire you can only can plug or patch holes on the tread area.  you need to get a new tire good luck|`|DV4xyeChaa	best to get 2 new tires at a time but if you get same size the tire police will not come for you...a puncture in side wall is not good...tire can be removed from rim and patched inside... cost more than plug in tread...15 to 25 dollars...
fwtJAsZSaa	Its the engine displacement capacity. Honda offers a choice of 2 different engines. The 1.6 would be slightly more powerful.  Thats all.|`|6Zflv6cpaa	one tenth of one liter the1.6 should get better fuel mileage because it doesn't have to work as hard to move the same weight
M79W3Ct9aa	Lots of good suggestions.  I've done my fair share of long drives myself.  I'll mention things from my experience:<br> <br> AAA plus membership-  I've only broken down once in over 50,000 miles of travel in my Chevy Blazer (bought truck at 135k, now has 185k, I stay up on maintenance) but had AAA when I got stranded that one time.  I believe the Plus version costs 120 bucks give or take and covers towing up to 100 miles.  This is cheaper than a tow bill in almost all cases.  Also, most hotels/motels give discounts for these AAA cardholders, especially the hotel-infested cities along the interstate.<br> <br> Extra money- I always have had $800 at least in extra cash whenever I go on long drives.  When I was stranded, it was my fuel pump that gave out in 105 degree summer weather.  This kind of weather puts a strain on ANY fuel pump.  I would make sure yours has been changed recently.  If its been a couple years I would swap it out for a new one before you leave.  Fuel pumps are one of those parts that fail at the worst time and can leave you stranded more often than not.  Anyway, when mine went out, I spent 6 hours in a hot waiting room, got a $750 bill, and was on my way again.  YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN!  Good to have money in reserve just in case.<br> <br> Winterfresh gum- This helps keep your eyes open, but ALWAYS stop to rest if you feel fatigued.<br> <br> Drinks- Avoid drinks with caffeine.  They will make you tired when it wears off.  Drink a lot of water instead.  Forces you to take more bathroom breaks and keeps you refreshed.<br> <br> This really depends on the person, but I don't eat TOO MUCH on road trips.  I usually get tired when I eat a lot.  I like to keep peanuts, trail mix, and granola bars with me during the drive.  Sometimes, I will keep a cooler with me with some form of ice pack to keep fresh fruit and yogurt with me in my truck.  I haven't done this on all my trips though.<br> <br> BRING PLENTY OF MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!  The radio certainly won't fill that void.<br> <br> Take the interstate when possible.  All those rest stops and the helpful blue information signs are on the interstate.<br> <br> Check the gas prices on your route before you leave.  It tends to vary greatly when traveling from state to state.<br> <br> Just take it easy and you will be fine.  Don't try to race everyone you see.  Cop presence seems to be a little heavier in the Southern states compared to others.  If you have a radar detector, try not to be ahead of the pack.  You'll get much earlier warnings if the people ahead ar gunned first (assuming Instant On is used).  Most people will be hauling balls at 85+ MPH anyway.  Best way to maximixe fuel economy is at 55-60 MPH in cruise control however.  Stay in the right lane unless you intend to pass.   Only pass semi trucks on THEIR left side.<br> <br> Good luck and safe travels!!!|`|JXWC0fxPaa	Some very good suggestions here. When you join AAA (highly recommended), they will give you all the maps and tour books you could ever want in addition to a route guide (trip-tik) - for free.<br>  <br>  Only drive in the day time. Plan the day's route before you start each day - where you want to stop to rest, eat, for fuel and sleep. Write down highway names or numbers and turn points<br>  <br>  If you feel sleepy or drowsy, get off the road and park.<br>  <br>  If you run into bad weather, park it if you are not sure what the road conditions are like ahead.<br>  <br>  Take your time and watch your speed. Keep your distance from the big rigs. The freeways and highways in the boonies are usually 2 lanes each way and they can get crowded in a hurry.<br>  <br>  Take lots of pictures. Have a great trip.|`|GIFCh6Ccaa	your car should be fine.  <br>  yes, you should learn to change a tire.  you should also learn to change windshield wipers.<br>  <br>  get AAA in case of a break down they can rescue you and help you find a quality mechanic who won't rip you off.<br>  <br>  get your car serviced before you leave.  oil change, trans flushed (if automatic), antifreeze tested.  get new plugs.  be prepared to have your oil changed at the halfway point on your trip.  <br>  <br>  get a tom tom.  that will keep you from getting lost.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Besides making sure your car has been serviced properly prior to the trip (look through the owner's manual to be sure all maintenance items are up to date or take it to a trusted mechanic if you don't know much about car maintenance to have it looked over), making sure your tires are in good shape and have plenty of tread left on them etc., here are some useful items to have on a long trip:<br>  <br>  - A full sized spare tire mounted on a steel wheel.  The temporary spare "donut" that the car comes with won't get you much more than 50 miles (especially in a hot desert) and you might need to go significantly farther than that should you have a tire go flat in the middle of nowhere.  As a bonus, you can leave the full-sized spare on the car for the remaider of the trip and not have to stop to get a new tire.....provided you don't get another flat anyway.<br>  <br>  - Duct tape.  Can temporarily fix lots of broken things including broken hoses.  Very useful if a coolant hose breaks many miles from the nearest service station.<br>  <br>  - A couple jugs of distilled water.  Good for refilling radiator should hose above break.  Also good if you get stranded somewhere for some other reason to have some water to drink in an emergency.<br>  <br>  - AAA service.  If nothing else, if something breaks that you can't fix you can call AAA (provided there's phone service available where you break down...) and they can help you out.  If you're not extremely mechanically inclined right now there's probably not a lot you can learn between now and then that will make much difference should something mechanical break during the trip.  Even the best mechanics need replacement parts anyway!<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|HBx6q05Oaa	These are all good suggestions and I would add change your timing belt. Hondas will run for ever if you do routine maintenance. Check your owners manual for the recommended interval. I would make me some good CD's or load up the Ipod with music. Tell someone your general itenerary in case something happens, somebody will know where to look. A TomTom or some GPS is always a good idea and now their not very expensive|`|f3b4a3eea25a5783bbde8265b9451986aa	Great suggestions so far!!  <br>  Stop every 2-3hrs to walk around & stretch your legs.  Pack for the weather, some areas, like WY, can still be chilly at night & AZ can be ungodly hot during the day.<br>  <br>  Cell Phone-Make sure your cell phone is on a nationwide plan & get a map with all of your plan's coverage area. Also, have a prepaid phone card in case your cell phone isn't working, such as your car charger takes a nose dive or bad cell area.  If you don't have it already, get an internet package on your cell phone.  If comes in so handy when you need to check for the local weather or mapquest for fuel.<br>  <br>  Have spare change handy for tolls if going through Chicago or going into San Francisco  <br>  <br>  Pace yourself on your trip.  Have a goal in mind (mileage or city).  You will need to when you get to the higher elevations in the Rockies, since you aren't acclimated to the altitude.  As a long haul truck driver, I figure 600mi a day is a good day.  If I get more, great, but if I don't, I know what I have to do the next day. <br>  <br>  If it hasn't been suggested already, pack spare fluids (oil, coolant, transmission, etc.) for the car & yourself, just in case of a problem.  Have fun this summer!!|`|hvNuBjIEaa	1.  plan your trip well.  know where you would stop for lunch and for overnight accommodations.<br>  <br>  2.  have another driver to relieve you.  a well-rested driver is a safe driver.<br>  <br>  3.  definitely basic knowledge of troubleshooting is a plus!  you don't want to be calling triple A for every minor thing.<br>  <br>  be safe!|`|XR3SPPCVaa	i would have all the maintanance done to your car. oil change tires checked, fulds replaced if needed. long time driving don't drink alot and after driving 6-8 hours stop and eat and sleep. check you tire persure in all you tires before you leave on the trip and check them every day be fore you leave that day good luck
1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	No, you can't.<br>  Yes, there are centrifugal, slipper, and other types of "auto" clutches available. They fit some, but not all motorcycles. As with anything else, there's a trade off. I feel you lose much more than can be gained by using one of these. Proper clutch operation has much more to do with than just go and stop. <br>  <br>  The Hondamatics were good bikes, but they were performance slugs compared to their standard trans brothers. I rode one for a while.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	No, not the same way that cars have automatic transmissions.  Honda use to make a 400 and a 750 "automatic" motorcycle-basically a 2 speed trans-low for speeds up to about 40 mph and then you nudged with your toe the shifter up into high for speeds above 41 mph.  They were slipper clutches.  They never sold well, so were dropped after like 2 years.  Other companies like Ridley and even Can AM have come out with bikes that have what they claim is an automatic trans.  I have yet to ride one, so can not say positively.<br>  <br>  I personally have taught people who claimed they could never get it down, how to ride a standard motorcycle.  I am betting you have a friend that could work with you also.  It does take time and practice and patience-hey none of us came out of the womb riding and we all learned.  But your frustration with your ability is holding you back.  I encourage you to clear your mind, and try again, this time with a friends help.  It will come to you.  If it doesn't and you truly desire to give into the "I can't, so I don't even want to try anymore attitude" then look to Ridley for their bikes or Can AM for the Spyder.|`|UXAjzdl2aa	there  is no way around it.<br>  things you do to help u learn:<br>  - get a moped, most are automatic, and easy to ride. once you master riding, and enjoy going out for rides, you would then move into a regular bike with manual tranny.<br>  - you can also try riding a small dirt bike, yes, most are manual, but riding a manual dirt bike on gravel, or sand, is much more forging on the transmission, and i have seen many people learn how to shift, and deal with the clutch on a dirt bike first, then move onto the road.<br>  once you you are familiar with the manual tranny, you will never wanna go back to automatic.<br>  hope that helps.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	There are automatic motorcycles, the Aprilia Mana and Honda DN-01 for example, given enough money and time you could turn any transmission into automatic. <br>  <br>  It is worth working at it though – the most satisfying feeling in motorcycling is when you combine all the skills and really nail a series of corners (well for me). Anything that gives that much enjoyment and satisfaction is not a waste of time.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  >THIS IS NOT TRUE AND THIS PERSON HAS NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT!<br>  <br>  Just because one might be limited by a small budget or narrow mind does not mean that it cannot be done. It might require replacing the whole transmission with a CVT version or changing a clutch – it can be achieved – eventually – at a cost in cash, time and skinned knuckles. That is the point I am making.|`|AJmCHSwmaa	I can't drive stick either. At first I had the hardest time learning to do the clutch and when to shift and everything else, I thought I would never get it down. Stay on frontage roads or paking lots and practice, you'll get it down and once you do you'll realize how easy it was and will wonder why you ever had a problems. Honda made a bike in the 80's called the Hondamatic. It wasn't very popular so they only made it for a year or two but you can pick one up in pretty good in running condition for under 3k. Alot of the fun or riding a bike is shifting and having all that control over the bike so I would reconsider and keep trying to learn, maybe even take a class they offer free bike classes. If you decide to go with an automatic though search craigfslist motorcycle section for a hondamatic.|`|3zH8xOxwaa	Stop being lazy...<br>  <br>  "given enough money and time you could turn any transmission into automatic.

I have sold three cars online(1 Weekend Warrior Toy Hauler, 1 2000 Model 30 FT Motorhome & a 52 FT Car hauler trailer) - technically I advertised online and sold it to them when they came to pick them up...But that is irrelevant.  I am a dealer and don't often sell online, but all of these were not off my car lot.  So to answer you, yes I have had good luck selling.  The Trailer was sold on Craigslist within 2 days, and the Motorhome and Transport trailer were on Ebay and did take quite a bit longer and had to be relisted.  <br>  <br>  As far as the selling price of your car, it sounds like you are looked up the retail price on your car.  If you are an individual selling your personal vehicle, this is not the price you can get for your car.  Kelley Blue Book (ww.kbb.com) lists three seperate categories for car pricing.  You can go to their site, click on used cars, make sure to enter your zip code, and complete the vehicle information.  ALL the options should be included (tilt, cruise control, power windows, spoiler, heads up display...you get the idea) and it will pull up your private party price.  Here is what I pulled up for your car in my area - the areas and locations do make a difference here.<br>  <a href="http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingReport.aspx?YearId=2004&Mileage=79030&VehicleClass=UsedCar&ManufacturerId=40&ModelId=249&PriceType=Private+Party&VehicleId=3282&SelectionHistory=3282%7c30081%7c85937%7c0%7c0%7c&Condition=Fair&QuizConditions=" rel="nofollow">http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingR...</a><br>  <br>  Bottom line in my area your car is worth $7400 in good condition - I didn't change any options on the base model GTP so this may not be 100% accurate.  Like I said, make sure to list all the options, because it does change the pricing.  Hope this answered your question.<br>  <br>  OH and also, Retail price for that car in excellent condition in my area is $10004 - <br>  <a href="http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingReport/2004_Pontiac_Grand%20Prix_3282_Retail_Fair.aspx?SelectionHistory=3282|30081|85937|0|0|&Mileage=79030&PriceTypePath=Private%20Party" rel="nofollow">http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingR...</a><br>  <br>  I wasn't able to answer your email, so here is my reply.<br>  Jeni, There is one thing to do in your situation and that is to try and get "pre-qualified" for another vehicle before you continue.  This economy is TERRIBLE and these Car Manufacturers are virtually going out of business, MAINLY because the Banks will NOT loan on cars right now.  I have been hearing repeatedly "I can't get approved" and these people have a credit score of 750 or better.  GM (General Motors) (who makes your Pontiac) is going bankrupt faster than any other Multimillion dollar conglomerate in the WORLD. (And this is AFTER they received Billions in Bailout money...)     Meaning, they are building their cars and sending them to the New Car Dealers (who do not pay for them until they are sold - They floor them, which basically means they rent these cars) and these cars are just sitting, not being purchased like they were before the economy took a dive.  That being said....Personally if I were you I would just stay in the GTP which is a fabulous car and continue to drive it.  It's already yours, no one can take it away unless you stop paying on it...AND you will most likely not get the finance rate you have now.   I think in your situation, I would suggest just staying in the car you have and granted you owe more than its worth, It's already yours.   The one thing to do to actually pay less (Check your contract to double check this) is to pay more than your normal monthly payment if possible.  This knocks the principal down, so there is LESS to calculate interest on.  If there is a prepayment penalty - this won't make much difference.  I can't tell you if there is a prepayment penalty or not, each bank is different.   My best suggestion I can make right now is to hold onto the car, keep driving it...And take care of it, service it when needed, (every 3000 miles get your oil changed) regularly and you will have a good car for a long time.  Hope|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	put ad in the news paper
87a2053ab936616fe165bf7b6720c722aa	When you trade in a car, the dealer will have an "expert" who will look at the car.  Most cars that are traded in are sent straight to auction and smaller dealers buy them to sell or strip for parts.<br>  <br>  If the dealer looks at your car and says they'll give you x amount of money for it....once the deal is signed.  It's a done deal.  They own the car and all of its problems.<br>  <br>  I just traded in a car last week and had the motor on the driver's side window stop working/freeze as I was driving to the dealer.  The window was closed and they didn't check it, we signed the papers so I own the new car and they own my old one.  It's an "As-Is" Transfer.<br>  <br>  Advice for you though is to look for a dealer that will run a special for a trade in of whatever for a car - no matter what the condition it's in.  They happen from time to time.  If you can't wait...you basically do not have a trade in.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4UilmYwKaa	Before the dealer takes a trade in car they'll do a full check and inspection so any problems will be found out.|`|ffafebee609d64b964cc56c2ea1f6194aa	The dealer will check the car out before he decides to accept it in trade. If he wants it, and he may not, he'll price it accordingly.<br>  <br>  Another poster told you to watch for dealers offering "we'll give you $2000 for your trade-in, no matter what condition" kind of deals. These deals are not what they seem. The dealer has already bumped up the price of the new car by $2000, so you essentially get nothing for your trade-in.|`|qt9jKjXUaa	Id say defineatly NO, it is the dealers responsibility to check out the car and determine the condition of it before they take it on an 'AS IS' trade in. they will usually give you below market for it anyway so they wouldnt be out too much more than most repairs. keep in mind, the car still has value, and they make money on both ends, selling you a car and now they still have a car to sell to someone (weather it be at dealer auctions, someone else, or for salvage) some dealers may try, but i dont think they have any foundation since most of the time dealers pull one over on the customer.

Why do you think that Chrysler, GM & Ford are nearly bankrupt? It's because they sold a lot of pick-ups to people who thought they'd get 17-18 mpg, and are getting 12 instead. Had you bought a Toyota, Honda, etc, you'd be getting better mileage because they are designed & built better, and your vehicle would still be worth something next year. There is nothing you can do to improve your mileage very much, and if Chrysler goes under (likely) I am sorry to tell you your truck will be worth almost nothing.
64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	The ZR1 and Viper ACR are very close.  The ACR was a little over 4 sec. quicker around the Nurburgring.  When you're talking about lap times of over seven minutes four seconds is a very slight advantage.  One thing that has to be taken into account when comparing these two laps is that the Viper ACR comes stock with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tires, which are barely street legal autocross tires.  The ZR-1 has Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires.  They may sound similar in name, but they are not even close. <br>  <br>  They are both impressive in my book.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Is the price difference still substantial?  When I had my "standard" 'Vette", some people would ask my why I didn't get a Viper since it was sooo much faster.  First, for the extra $20K, I could have modified the "Vette" to waste a Viper.  Secondly, I really didn't need to go over 150 mph.  And lastly, I would rather have the comfort & amenities the 'Vette" offered.|`|GIFCh6Ccaa	Z06 can and did.  handles better, drives easier and is even faster straight line (road and track) plus it set the new lap record at nuremburg... <br>  <br>  and it's more comfortable, quieter, cooler (you can cook things on the door sills in a viper it gets so hot) and more reliable.  while the old vipers could single lap beat the corvette, there's a reason that although they both run in the same class in LeMans racing the corvette nearly always wins.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	I dont think it will! GM is always trying to catch up to Dodge and Mopar racing but can't quite get there. The 2010 Vette up their HP but it still doesn't handle or 0-60 as good and fast as a Viper.

The corvette zr1 will smoke anything on the street, including a viper.  Dodge won't be around much longer anyways|`|fwtJAsZSaa	I assume youre talking about the ACR and the ZR1.  The viper has a much higher displacement so unless they make radical changes to the corvettes engine, there are not going to be any changes there so the viper will be faster in a straight line. As for handling i feel the corvette is definitely better and will get better if GM shows more interest in it. The Viper has never been a handler in my opinion and the only reason it is at the top of the leader board at nordschleife is because they tuned it for that 1 lap. The corvette is any day better as an overall car.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	According to the March 2009 Car and Driver magazine, the latest Corvette ZR1 has more power, weighs less, accelerates faster, stops harder, and has a higher top speed than the than the latest Dodge Viper SRT10.  So I guess the answer to your question is 'yes'?  (albeit for more money).<br>  <br>  As far as track times go, it's hard to say anything one way or the other because I don't know exactly what "track times" you're referencing.  Are you talking about road-course racing or drag strip times?

tCpJPjHQaa	the new keys have a chip in them. if the key your starting the car with  (in this case the screw driver) doesnt have the chip or the right chip even if its identical to the actual key, it will not work. usually when the dealer can make a new key if they have the 17 digit VIN, but youll need to put the ignition back together in order for it to work.

Did THEY fudge your age on the contract? Was this a "buy-here, pay-here" dealer?|`|L9LkdThjaa	Learners permit means nothing.  You can sell a car to someone who does not have a license.  However your age is everything.  Tell them in court when you purchased the vehicle you where not the legal age of purchasing vehicle, and the contract should be null and void because you where not old enough to sign a legal binding contract.|`|47f68597748b8362993a581aa0e99a14aa	It wasn't illegal for you to buy the car, but it was illegal for you to drive it.  <br>  <br>  I'm almost sure you have to be at least 18 y.o. to enter into a binding contract.

tfC8BQXOaa	I don't actually know what to say, if I were you I'd get a lawyer on this.

fQBfjdz1aa	First off, Tampbay gives this same advice out to everybody.<br>  <br>  Second, I'm very sorry for your accident and I'm sure you're not feeling well right after the accident.  Usually in 2-3 days you'll start feeling a little better.  Whiplash  will usually heal up in about 2-6 weeks depending on many different things.<br>  <br>  You don't say what state you are in so some things may differ as far as the injuries and what to expect.  Yes, the other insurance will want to secure a recorded interview, especially when this is a three vehicle accident.  Many times the third vehicle will say the second vehicle hit you first and all they did was hit the third vehicle.  This is where your statement will come in handy.  True they cannot force you to do a statement but personally, you are only hurting yourself when you do this.  A statement is used to preserve the facts.  Rarely is it used in court as 90% of all claims are settled out of court.  So this is really a non-issue.  You were the first vehcile and no matter what the other two vehicles say, you were the innocent party, you have nothing to lose by providing the statement.<br>  <br>  Let's  move on to the injuries.  Depending on the investigation facts the insurance company responsible will evaluate the claim based on your medicals and damages to your vehicle.  meaning if you have $400 in damages your chances of retiring is slim to none.  They will pay for your medical bills and a small settelement for your inconveneince.  The old addage for 2-2.5 times  your meds is really old.  Most whiplash claims are only worth about $500 over your medical costs and even the medical costs are something they will take a look at.  For example if you do see a chiro, your treamtment  should not last more than 12 visits or so. at which time you should fee better.  <br>  <br>  What you are able to do is file a claim under your own policy.  If you live in a MED PAY state then  you can go to the doctor and YOUR  insurance company will pay the bills and then collect this back from the other company.  then the other company will offer you a settlement amount  for your pain and suffering.  If you are in a PIP state then you may be able to collect under both policies depending on what state you live in and the verbage.  IE: the bills for the ER are $1500, your insurance will owe this but so will the other company.  It's like double dipping but it's okay for injuries.  But before you do this check with your adjuster with your insuance company as this may not be ok in all states.<br>  <br>  Everyone will have an idea  of what you think you have coming to you.  I know you hear the big storie, i got 20k, i got 5k and so on.  Reality is that most don't come near those amounts. It's not a matter of what the insurance companies don't want to pay but more of what an insurance company owes for the claim.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!!!!|`|JMJsCU1vaa	The other persons insurance company will be in contact usually by first light the next day to try to get to you before you have time to consult with an attorney or to think about what happened too long.. They will want to get a recorded statement from you… Decline this, tell them that there is not going to be any recorded statement at this time… This way you have refused the statement but allowed them to think you may do it at a later time… They will likely not take no for an answer and try to convince you that it’s just a simple procedure they have to do and won’t take too much of your time at all… <br>  Tell them again there will be no statement.. They will likely ask you if you’ve retained an attorney then, tell them No you have not , that you feel that this matter could be resolved without involving attorneys.<br>  This should please them and will save you money in fees later on at settlement…<br>  <br>  Now comes treatment for your injuries… Even though you may not feel much more than a headache or what appears to be other relatively minor ache and pain I urge you to seek out a chiropractor who will assess your condition and advise you as to what course of treatment he prescribes for your condition..<br>  It is possible that you have need for treatment prior to the accident but the accident brought your problem to the forefront with the impact, meaning your headache and or other pains…<br>  Start treatment with your Chiropractor and depending on your condition might need to be treated 3 days a week for a several weeks then 2 times a week for a several weeks then once a week until he releases you from immediate treatment… <br>  This is where the negotiation for settlement comes into play… Once you have a total medical bill to work with you now have a basis for negotiation…<br>  Even though your PIP insurance pays for your medical, you still use the total medical bill for negotiations…<br>  You should typically end up settling for 2 to 2.5 times your total medical bills for your pain and suffering.<br>  Don’t accept the measly amount they will try to offer you at first, tell them you were hoping to resolve this without attorneys, and that you will need a more reasonable offer, they will likely increase the offer immediately but only by 500 or 1000 bucks….decline again and they will likely tell you they have to talk it over with someone… <br>  Tell them (example I have 3000 in medical bills) so your offer is going to have to be reasonable compensation for that amount…they know what’s protocol, they are just doing their job by trying to give as little as possible..<br>  When you finally arrive at a mutual settlement amount, have them mail you all the paperwork…and when you receive this, take it to your bank to have your signiture notarized and send the paperwork back to them and a check for the agreed upon amount will follow in about 10 days… They usually expedite the check to you as they don’t want you to change your mind…<br>  <br>  This of course will save you 33-40% in attorney fees, and unless you have a complicated major injury case, you’ll do just as well as an attorney… we’re led to believe we’re not capable of settling these issues ourselves…that is just nonsense…<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I have applied these techniques about 6 times and I’ve always gotten nice settlements of  between 5-10 grand…<br>  Good Luck…<br>  Feel free to contact me for future or additional counseling, I have a person in NY who is currently settling a 20K accident claim and I coached her all the way, she saved a fortune $6600.00 not using an attorney and handling it herself, the insurance company tried several times to trick her but she always contacted me for advice before she acted, and now she has 20K...|`|AA11914369	Make a report to YOUR insurance company and let them handle this for you.|`|AA10628838	Have your insurance company to handle everything by going after the other insurance company. The reason is that your insurance company is not going to want to be out of pocket for expences the other guy is liable for. That is what you pay them for, and they will go after the other insurance company. A lot simpler than the first answer and no attorney's fees.
HpWmkhabaa	Sounds like the gas tank is possibly lined with black algae coal which is causing decay and giving you a hard time to crank it up. Please take it to a repair shop.|`|bW931jBaaa	Make sure the choke is working. It will either be a cable or electric.|`|cc3WuUoraa	Its got nothing to do with algae in the gas tank. It could be that the battery is old and doesn't have enough juice to turn it over fast enough. Or maybe its sucking air under the carb somewhere.

EMC7JwVBaa	The Jag must have premium. You can mess that high compression engine up really bad putting lower octane in it. The least will be blowing a head gasket. People need to be careful saying use the lowest octane because higher is a waste of money. It's a waste of money to wind up needing the head off that Jag to fix a head gasket- a couple of grand at least and use an expert. When it says use premium, it's serious.|`|AA11828439	It is always best to follow the manufacturers recommendations.|`|ytgjFFq6aa	most cars that requir premium studder when you put regular in it. get the tank down to about hlaf and fill it back up with premium, this will make it kinda like plus, run this all the way to empty and then re fill with premium. the spark plugs should be fine, but if not after doing those steps then change your plugs and wires|`|1rd0uf94aa	Use premium fuel if the car is supposed to run on premium. It will not run as well, will get lower fuel economy, and will not save you any money. If it ran properly on premium and it doesn't run right on regular, switch back right away. You may need to add a fuel injector cleaner to the tank or even switch the plugs if they are fouled.|`|fwtJAsZSaa	it most definitely has to be the gas. Putting regular or any other kind of a fuel in a premium only vehicle results in knocking which is probably what you are experiencing.
vfhKkiSKaa	There is a mathematical way to figure it out but basically what it originally meant is that if something were 5 horsepower it would take 5 horses to create the same power as that engine.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Horsepower is a made up number.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower</a><br>  <br>  It was originally created, as an advertising gimmick.<br>  <br>  Basically, you have torque, which is the force that moves your car forward.<br>  <br>  Take that number, multiply it, divide it, and you create an imaginary unit, called horsepower.<br>  <br>  You could call it monkey power if you wanted.<br>  <br>  Just as pointless.<br>  <br>  You'll have people swear up and down that horsepower is all that matters in a car. Problem is, it's just a number calculated from torque.  Ultimately, it doesn't say anything at all about how fast a car is, how much power it has, or anything else. And many places have stopped using it, because it's so pointless.|`|VTv7zsfFaa	power is a measure of work an engine can perform, for example 1hp is 33,000 ft-lb/minutes best go to wikipedia and search horsepower to get a better understanding, stay away from thier calculations. hp was taken from how much work a donkey can do
AA12261615	that's the torque converter switch in the transmission that's probably causing that to happen,it not disengaging and as soon as it goes in gear its in lock up mode,you,ll have to get a shop to drop the pan and replace the switch on it,most transmission shops will do that one for about 150 bucks,that's parts and labor,good luck.|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	you need to have looked at|`|33ztb5CZaa	When you put it into gear, the first thing you should do is immediatly press the clutch, if not, the engine will try to tug on the flywheel and the fly wheel can't move because of the brake.

4dntstR9aa	They certainly should - No where in my contract does it say that they have to tow the car to a shop.  It isn't going to affect your policy or coverage to call and ask them.  Until you give them your member # they won't even know who you are.  I believe they will do it for you.|`|SuZbBnycaa	No. Your membership is specific to you. Not your car. Not your family. <br>  <br>  If you were driving a friends car and the car got a flat tire, YOU are disabled, YOU are inconvenienced. The flat gets changed.<br>  <br>  In fact, if your friend was driving and you were the passenger, you are still disabled and the flat gets changed. <br>  <br>  but if you're the only member in your family, and your husband or uncle gets a flat down the street, and you're not in the car ... sorry, but you are not disabled... they are. <br>  <br>  If you are the only one in your family with a membership, then you are the only one the AAA will service. <br>  <br>  If there is a family of 6 people and they all drive, and only one has a membership, but they all shared, then the AAA would lose money and you can't run a business like that. Simple.<br>  <br>  And Oklatom is correct. The AAA will not tow a car because it has expired tags, at least not for free.<br>  <br>  At the classic level, you get 8 miles of towing. At the Plus level you get 100 miles. At the Premium level you get 200 miles once and 100 miles three more times...all free|`|FsT54qh1aa	Yes, they will tow it wherever you want to be repaired. It just so happens it is another residence. You paid for the service and they tow you where you want to go.|`|XR3SPPCVaa	they might tow it for you just call them and try it out.  or get your husbands car jump started and drive it him self good luck|`|AA11914369	Not likely.  AAA covers roadside emergencies, and having expired tags doesn't an emergency make.<br>  <br>  You can probably find someone to tow, but you can't put it on the emergency card, you'll have to pay cash.

NOT!<br>  The Bronco 2 had a bad roll-over reputation that was true. I had one and it was a very fuel efficient dependable vehicle.

On a piece of paper is very easy to view in the windshield, put in more general info such as if your the original owner, mileage, & some other maintenance items. Put in how old the tires are, cold a/c, new stereo, recent service, & whatever else is important. Put it in bold letters so people can read it from a foot away.

Or conduct any other state business of that sort: Registration, etc.|`|9ee6ddc38b0329a7f432890bc9b58804aa	It's an old work around. States previously did not share driving info so there was a time that this was totally possible. You'd apply for a license in a state using a friend or relative's address. Now most states share a comprehensive database but things still slip through the cracks. If you are intent on trying you should look to states like Arkansas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, The Dakotas, Alabama and such.<br>  <br>  You may get a license issued then it could get revoked at a later date if their systems dig deeper.|`|ym9bT5lmaa	No! DMV's share the computer system!|`|AA11264416	no, it would transfer to the new state, plus you'd have to be a resident of the new state so you couldn't get a license there even if it wasn't suspended, your record stays with you just like a criminal record would, so no way around it|`|4dntstR9aa	I think it depends on the states & how stringent the DMV"s are.

I always try to buy one of the vehicles that they have on the lot. Not always possible, but should be explored. When I bought my 2006 Jetta DTI they tried that stunt on me. I made it quite clear that if they tried that, I would leave immediately. Be polite etc, and don't get angry. But speak with conviction and don't smile. They will get the message.

Lighter cars are less to insure. Less powerful cars are also cheeper. Stick with basic colors. Go for a sedan, they are a lot less than something two door or sporty. Also if you plan on having a deductible on your insurance then the age an blue book value come into play. <br>  <br>  You have a lot of options for 8k.

dWLgwb3baa	That's just a measurement of power.<br>  <br>  Reciprocating engines, like you'd find in your car, work by delivering power to a shaft, so the power is usually measured in shaft horsepower.<br>  <br>  Jet engines work by compressing and accelerating large masses of air and vectoring that air out the back.  That measurement is pounds of thrust.  Many engines can produce higher amounts of thrust for a short amount of time, typically 5 minutes.  This is what is meant by takeoff thrust.  The other number you may hear is maximum continuous thrust, which is a bit lower than maximum takeoff thrust.

If you do not take care of your health, how long do you expect to live? The same is true with a vehicle, if you don't perform the preventative maintenance that is required. Fluid life is not forever and as it ages the chemical make up of it changes. Engine oil becomes acidic with age and instead of protecting the engine, it will attack the bearing surfaces. Engine coolant is a synthetic mixture that protects against over heating and freezing, yet over time it becomes alkali based and does more harm than good. Changing these fluids is vital to a long life and fewer repairs. A well maintained vehicle has no expiration date.|`|k56mmj2eaa	I would get it serviced. a well maintained vehicle will last you a long time.

When you look at the examiner, that person decides who gets to drive the road. Yet examiners are not consistent in their evaluations. Each has a different set of values and standards. Many examiners failed applicants because they could not parallel park. To me, parallel parking is not a pass/fail criteria. And who parks between cones anyway? The road test examiner gives the last look at how well an applicant can handle a vehicle. If all the applicants evaluated by a particular examiner pass, it could be the luck of the draw or the applicants were good enough to pass. There can be no preset number on how many pass or fail. If it was ever found out that there was a quota, the state would be wide open for a law suit.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|zruhNGKbaa	NO.<br>  While not all examiners are exactly equal in their interpretation of exactly at what point you have committed a "violation" during the road driving part of the test,  each examiner is testing every candidate driver to the exact same state mandated procedure with the same number of  possible faults or errors permissible in the basic handling portion and in the road driving portion of the test.  <br>  <br>  You may find this difficult to believe but examiners really do not care if you pass or fail ( they get paid either way ) but they care passionately about safe driving and hold all candidates to the same high standard to assure that all licensed drivers do know how to drive safely! <br>  <br>  By the way, the basic handling portion of the test is inherently flawed - in real life no one cares if you go back and forth 3 times to get properly positioned in a parallel parking spot, and they do care if you jump the curb or hit another vehicle,  in the parallel parking part of the test simply back into the area defined by the cones and stop and beep - do not even try to position properly !  You will get one point for being out of the lines - but you will get one point for each time you maneuver beyond one backing move, one stop and one forward move and one stop.  NOT very realistic!  Most people who fail the test during the basic control portion fail by racking up points trying to actually get properly positioned! <br>  <br>  Many people who fail during the driving portion do so because they fail to come to a complete stop before any portion of the vehicle crosses: A) The painted Stop Line or Painted Crosswalk line. or<br>  B) An imaginary line crossing the road perpendicular to the Stop Sign.<br>  You must come to a complete and total stop within 10 feet before that point and look both directions before proceeding, if when stopped at the correct location you do not have a clear view in both directions of the intersecting road - and at MOST intersections this will be the case! - then after the complete stop, you may inch forward while continuing to scan in both directions until you CAN see clearly in both directions. If at any point you observe conflicting traffic on the crossing street you must stop again and wait for the traffic to clear, if when you reach the point where you can see clearly in both directions and there is no conflicting traffic you may then accelerate smoothly through the intersection or perform any specified turn as the instructor has previously directed.  <br>  <br>  Drive Safely!|`|Qeor2wKLaa	No, if they get a load of good drivers they all pass.

She could no longer pay all her bills and was going to loose her car.  She owed around $8k on the car.  The bank was willing to settle for just over $3k, the amount they figured they would get at auction.<br>  Point is, won't hurt to ask about any settlement amount,  and maybe mention chapter 7 as an option.  It is entirely up to the person and policy of the company you are dealing with.<br>  Good luck

An sr22/sr1p would be required if you had one of the following in the state of california #1 a dui, #2 an accident that you didnt have insurance on #3 too many tickets or accidents. If you need an sr22/sr1p you would be notified by the dmv to provide it.  Hope this helps|`|3zH8xOxwaa	i beleive an sr-22 is a serious crime commited while driving
4dntstR9aa	Are you making someone business cards for advertising what he does?<br>  If I were doing that I would probably list it as....<br>  <br>  Certified Technician, specializing in Struts/Shocks and Suspension. Something to that effect.  BUT if he is NOT certified, don't put it on there - he could get himself sued.  Glamorize the title a bit though.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Sorry, can't translate as I don't know what it does say.
EnaCCMQJaa	Daf, MAN, Mercedes, Iveco - Ford Cargo, Renult, all are capable performers at this weight (7.5 tonnes) Look for one with around 150 bhp which will give good performance & good fuel returns of around 15 mpg plus.|`|96b65acfcbdff367c21572dba47ccc2aaa	The Daf should be okay. MAN and Merc would be good too. As for mpg I'd say around 14 or 15.
379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	You keep asking this as if you will get better answers the more you do. The DMV would be the only ones to give a correct answer. If you are determined to have a car right away, find one that does not have any title issues.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	It is entirely dependent on the State and the laws of the State it is titled in.  Rather than try to guess what the laws are in the State you are fooling around in, why don't you lease the vehicle from your friend until the title arrives?  Hoping it does arrive.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	Never make a car deal without the title ready in hand from a private seller!  You need that before anything else can be done.<br>  And, unless your friend is in the leasing business legally, forget it!|`|L9LkdThjaa	NO, not possible.<br>  <br>  You must have the title to get license plates. In order for you to get license plates the ownership of the vehicle must change.  The ONLY way ownership can legally change is with a title.  A title is just more that a title.  It is printed on what they call secure paper.  Also to transfer owership, you must according to federal law for the odometer reading. Federal Law 580.5              The odometer statement is the secure paper part of the title which is required in every transaction.
SuZbBnycaa	It's always helpful to know what state you're from....<br>  In California:<br>  Sometimes lenders do a "paperless" title. In that case you would go to the DMV with REG 262 Transfer and Reassignement form which has the sellers signature and  odometer disclosure on it and use the "REG 227 duplicate for title". The seller and buyer  needs to sign both forms. Check the box that says "paperless" title. You walk out with a registration for your glove compartment and the new title will be mailed to you in about 5 weeks.<br>  <br>  In your case:<br>  Go to the DMV or AAA Auto Club and fill out the again REG 262 and REG 227 Duplicate for Title, (best if buyer and seller go together so all signatures are where they should be) The DMV will "RDF" for lien satisfied/title. That means the transfer will be incomplete until you return with the title. But you will leave with a registration in your name, to be replaced when you complete the transfer.<br>  <br>  The seller should sign a Release of Liability, just in case you don't follow through and never complete the transfer. Which means the DMV data will have both buyer and sellers name in their computer until you do so.<br>  <br>  As long as the registration is paid, the tag is on the back plate, the car has not been reported stolen, transfer fee ($15) is paid, use tax is paid....there is no reason why you can't drive the car legally.|`|a1c8de4998a925f3bb28738b7f0b9122aa	you will need a title in order to register your car
i38Ev1Zaaa	Both are different classes of cars. The Lancer is compact, while the Altima is midsized.<br>  <br>  Personalyl, i would go with the Altima- its more fun to drive, more reliable, and it has better resale value.<br>  <br>  The Lancer is actually really boring to drive, and has numerous mechanical problems- which accounts for their plummeting resale value.<br>  <br>  To the guy who said his is great- i have seen many experiences like that, but they've all been with the Ralliart or the EVO Lancers, never the base. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TbiSBXclaa	Not much love for Mitsubishi among the uninformed.<br>  <br>  I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Lancer and it has given me over 75K miles of completely reliable service so far.

jlUGIQV2aa	Yup, it will work fine, it will open up the capability of the supercharger a lot as well. Cool Air = more airflow. Good airflow + supercharger = a lot of power.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  In fact, it is better for the engine to have an Intake when an engine has a supercharger or turbocharger.<br>  <br>  Intake cools engine more and gives more power.<br>  <br>  Intakes by AEM or Injen are best.<br>  <br>  K&N and Fujita are cheaper brands.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	Not only can you but you will let out the supercharger noise kind of neet.

HO5lWoNDaa	If you cannot find any contact details online for the seller of the item then chances are you have been a victim of fraud. All registered companies provide you with contact details so think anyone not providing these details has a hidden reason for not wanting to be contacted.<br>  <br>  Unless you have proof of posting or find the tracking number there isnt much you can do regarding finding the parcel.<br>  <br>  If you paid via your bank and this transaction shows on your statement then get all the payment and item details together along with the company name etc and go to your local citizens advicen centre :)<br>  <br>  Good luck
