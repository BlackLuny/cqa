AA10097817	HIGH GLOSS WOOD FINISH    Assuming you are starting with a stripped down to bare wood without stain top. (If you have an uneven look, or any messes you are best to just sand it down).    At Lowes, all in the same isle you will find RUB ON stain and protector, in every wood color. As you rub this into the wood with circular movement the wood absorbs the both the stain and rich tung oils giving you that rich depth of wood you are looking for. It comes in finishes and you should use the high sheen formula. Easy to apply and dries quickly (meaning hours not days) apply as many coats as needed. Between coat sanding? Nope, just hand buff gently with elbow grease between coats until the color and depth you desire is achieved. It should already be shiny but it is not yet protected. There is a RUB ON protective finish called High gloss Polyurethane which is the best. Here less is more. Just two VERY THIN rubbed in coats will leave the desk just beautiful. Two things to note. Work with cheese cloth! It is in the same isle and is completely lint free. It will save you a lot of heartache. Then, be sure the furniture is in a controlled temperature environment. If it is under 60 degrees it will not work as it should and your results won't be all that you want them to be.    I copied this awhile back.

But if that's not practical for you, you have some questions to ask yourself.    If you were to have a handgun, are you prepared to learn how to use it properly and safely?  To keep it properly stored?  And how would you feel if you did shoot someone?  If you have a handgun, you have to be willing to use it and don't think just the sight of it is going to scare someone off.  If you don't know without a doubt in your mind that you could and would use it, don't buy one.  The worst case scenario here is that they could take it away from you and use it on you or one of your family.

I spend 15 minutes every morning and every evening "tidying" up and I do this during the time I am waiting for my coffee to brew or while dinner is in the oven. Anything hanging around on the kitchen table, on coffee tables, on tables in the entrance way, it all gets put away. <br>  <br>  Also handle all incoming mail and paperwork by immediately dealing with it--this can help a lot with clutter. Have a mail sorting system, you can use baskets, trays, or desktop file holders. Put bills in one, papers to save in another, and other items that need action (such as permission slips, things you need to call about, things you need to shred) in another. Also you can deal immediately with junk mail by putting it straight in the recycling or trash. Then once a week, empty out your system (on Saturday). File anything in your permananet filing system, shred whatever needed, make your calls, pay bills. <br>  <br>  Finally the "stuff" from each of the four people who live in your house can really clutter up the house! This is what I do, each person has a basket and a coat hook. Make a rule, everything that they bring in (wallet, keys, cell, purchases, hats, mittens, etc.) is put on the hook or in the basket. If you have a coat closet, make it a rule that each person puts their coat away immediately. At the end of the night, the person is responsible for dealing with each item in teh basket as appropriate.<br>  <br>  Good luck! With a little discipline and organization, it can be a cinch to keep your house tidy. But I know it's difficult to change, I hope the rest of the household helps!|`|fvuEtkROaa	It sounds as though you are keeping things clean.  The problem seems to be more of a problem of clutter.  Do you have enough storage space ?  My Mom always said, "A place for everything; put everything in its place."  With four of you living in one space, each of you  should be picking up after yourselves... even little  children can be taught to put away their toys.  Throw out newspapers and magazines (recycle), wash dirty dishes, have a hamper for laundry. Have everybody get involved with making a plan to keep things tidy.<br>  Good luck with your effort.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	You say 4 people live there.

There's really no reason for *you* to stay up to midnight to clean.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Get rid of the clutter, box it up and stick it in the attic. You will have a lot less housework and it will look better.|`|DAS7nrUOaa	Get rid of one of the people and see if that helps.  If not get rid of another one.  If that doesn't help try living by yourself.|`|wMeQoXkzaa	It is so frustrating I know. But the older folks tell me I will miss the toys and kids messes when they are off and on their own. Anyway-<br>  is you have less stuff there is less to clean and take care of so I try to keep out the clutter and nonsense. There is no sense having great stuff if you can't enjoy it because there is TOO MUCH great stuff. <br>  Try to get rid of a few things every day that do not get used much. Find a place- a corner by the door, a spot in the garage if you have one, or a chair in your room, closet etc.- where you can put things that you are wanting to get rid of- things that don't seem to get used much if at all. <br>  Let them sit there in a bag or box as you add more to it and when a few months have gone by if you have not gone and retrieved an item from the area for someone then you CAN let it go and get rid of it. <br>  This way you know you are right in letting it go and won't feel bad about it or worry that you will get rid of something you later find out you should have kept. <br>  When you do take it out of the house and give it to a thrift shop or charity, you WILL feel good about it. To get that empty space back again makes you feel so FREE. <br>  As for structural things like not having a nice floor or whatever you can always use cheap paint to camouflage stuff that isn't so pretty.<br>  With cleaning things, schedule a time every day to wash the dishes and tidy up a bit but don't let housework rule your life. You sound very clean so you will jsut have to accept that it will NEVER be as perfect as we'd like it to be, but kids grow up fast and you'll miss it soon enough.<br>  If these are adults you live with then keep your own space clean and share in the work for the rest. You can apologize to guests and show off YOUR space so they see the mess is not because YOU are a slob.  Good luck.

Why not try one of the computer sites like B&Q on line|`|944iJNAdaa	Those computer programs are pretty nice for visualizing what your kitchen could look like.  I think it still depends on the skill of the person putting the information is, because I've got different looking ideas from different stores (which is good, because then you can compare).  I think all you have to do is go into the store and act like you're interested in spending money with them.  Sometimes they've wanted me to make an appointment first.  They're pretty used to working with novices, that's their specialty really.  I wouldn't be worried about that, just don't let them pressure you into buying because that's typically what they're really going to try to do - sell you something, and basic salesmanship means they're going to want to sell it to you right then, too.  Think it over for awhile, get some competing stores to offer you plans, then decide.|`|e9f5dcec520cd586cd97f18b437a1c4baa	Get whomever you are going to use to fit the kitchen to plan it. The room may be rectangular bit there are windows, doors and services/plumbing to work around. <br>  <br>  There are several good free programs they might use and It'll take them not much time. Sketch out your ideas first on pencil & paper, give them a copy and let them fine-tune the arrangements.<br>  <br>  B&Q plans are hopeless; they do stuff like order oven cabinets where they are not needed (some ovens install on runners fixed to adjacent cabinets). a fitter would also be able to get a trade discount...

You can find really nice colors for less than half the price.

Lots of people have respiratory problems brought on by dust mites, but other than desensitization I'm not sure what else they can do but prescribe medication - asthma is a typical symptom, and I know some sufferers use inhalers.  Basic sanitation of the house might reduce dust mites, but once someone is sensitized to them, this is a difficult thing to control.

83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	I recommend that you leave it to compost for a couple of months minimum,  as manure can contain weed seeds that would grow profusely, as well as the manure being harsh for your plants, when fresh.  It readily heats up, ensuring that the breakdown is faster than if scattered more thinly over soil.<br>  <br>  Composting will heat up and kill weed seeds,  and allow the manure to undergo part of the Nitrogen cycle, where nitrogen is converted into forms that are more readily usable by plants.  In the early stages it's possible that manure takes nitrogen from your soil, to help with the process of this breakdown.  <br>  <br>  The general policy is always to use well rotted animal manure,  for example by digging your plot over in the autumn, incorporating some manure, which would be perfect for spring grown crops.  As farmers with horses and growing crops we have a plentiful supply,  but we happily let it sit around doing its magic before using it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck!  Rob|`|wHVx9HZVaa	I agree with Rob. Do not use it fresh it will do more harm than good. Not only is it going to heat up whilst degrading but horses are injected with all sorts of stuff these days and you need to know all those nasties are inactive as well. It also uses a lot of the nutrients the plants need to actually breakdown so it is of little use until matured.<br>  As for how long...Don't plant in it until all the smell has gone. Known as smelling sweet.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	if it is not fresh can put it in when planting,better off ahead of time though.they say you should wait a year before using manure but i have used it before that and not had any burning|`|ufdFei1jaa	You can plant when the time is right for planting the type of veg/flower . It is not about the manure.|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	Cow manure should be composted or allowed to decompose some before planting. Horse manure can generally be used at any time. The difference is the readily available nitrogen . Because of the difference in the digestive systems of the animals.  It is best to compost first or allow to do so in the plot first for both kinds though.

v3xEtuLLaa	Take a large paper clip and using a pair of pliers put a bend of about 1/4" on the end.  Work that into the top side of the lock until you can catch one of the teeth.  Slowly pull it towards you and it should come out.  If that doesn't work, you'll need a locksmith or a new lockset (may be cheaper for a new lock).  Good luck.|`|3W18HDxxaa	first of all the key slot needs to be in the rest position <br>  locked or unlocked  use a needle to pick it out,|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	Short of removing the lock from the door and taking it to a locksmith, use any piece of thin metal with a ‘hook’ on the end that can grab key and (needle nose pliers may work)  spray WD 40 into key-way, make it as easy as possible for key piece to slide out. <br>  Insert your tool  into key-way Try grabbing the key cut with the tool and work with the grooved edge of the key, not the smooth edge. Once your tool grabs the key cut, try sliding it out. <br>  If key won’t slide out, try a quick tug with your tool–key may pop out. <br>  If the piece just won’t budge, make sure the lock cylinder is in neutral position and not turned slightly. If so, adjust and retry.<br>  If it won’t come out, you will need to replace the doorknob and that is a pretty easy job.<br>  To make sure this does not happen to you again a good way to maintain your locks is to use a tube of graphite (made for locks) and spray into locks every 6 months.

Your fireplace (I think you meant wood stove) model number refers to a Century Wood Stove. I put a link below for your info and below you can refer that gives detailed safe info for operating your stove. Make sure your stove has been properly installed before you start a fuire PLEASE.<br>  Best types of wood to burn are maple, beech, ash and yellow birch. I must be properly seasoned to be efficient.<br>  Clear out any ashed to allow air flow through the grate. Put crumpled newspaper in the stove and do not use colored or glossy paper. Add 5-10 small pieces of dry kindling wood on top and behind the paper. Open the air supply vent all the way.<br>  Light the paper in several places near the air inlet. Don't leave the stove unattended for 15-20 min.When the flames begin to subside, add about 3 small pieces of firewood crisscrossing them, do not smother the existing fire.<br>  Now adjust the vent and gradually increase the size of your fire as the embers build up.<br>  In the first 10-15 minutes the most air is necessary corculation is required complete the combustion phase. THen add no less than three pieces of wood at a time  to sustain the fire, and place the wood loosely to ensure even burning. Adding larger pieces of wood in combination with sufficient air will burn slowly without smoke and ensure proper burning.<br>  DO NOT burn wet, green or pressure-treated wood, household garbage,plastic, cardboard, coal or wet wood|`|sXTjYH7Iaa	Here is the link to the manual.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vermontcastings.com/catalog/elements/files/FW300007-8.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.vermontcastings.com/catalog/e...</a>
5809c406b87c68be7f3c5ecc70c41e8faa	You coud cut those starting blooming tulips flowers for flower arrangement or simplely put them into a vase.  For the rest of leaves and bulbs you still can pour some water until the summer has come when the weather is hot.  Then stop watering the bulbs once the weather is very hot which will make your bulb cooked very easily. Then simplely tilt the flower pot and put it in shade where the water of rain will not slip into flower pot until the fall comes.  Then restarting to water bulb again.  The safiest way is to take the bulb out of pot once the whole leaves were all dry in the summer time and put them in the egg carton or a paper box and store them in the crytal drawer in fridge for at least 6 weeks long ... that you will get long stem and big blooming tulips in the next year.  It is kind romantic to give someone you love tulips rather rose.|`|83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	If your tulips are growing in good soil then they should be able to continue to grow, and to build up their bulb strength ready for flowering next year.  <br>  <br>  If you remove the seed head, which is at the centre of the flower, this will stop any energy being lost trying to make seeds, should they have been pollinated.  It's probably worth supplementing their water, every other week, with some dilute fertiliser too, as this will help them to store more energy in their bulbs.  I'd recommend transplanting to outdoors, for growth next year,  though they could be kept dry as bulbs, once their foliage has died, in a couple of months - if the weather is not too frosty, you could place your pot outdoors, once the flowers have finished, and care for it there (subject to having the space etc).<br>  <br>  Keep them moist, and it's fine to allow the soil to dry out slightly, before watering - this would prevent them rotting from over-watering. Don't be disappointed if next year's flowers are not as brilliant as this year's, as they've been produced professionally, in order to make a great looking potted flowering gift.  They will return to better strength in subsequent years, though it's possible that your care for them this year will pay off, and they'll be as good next year too. I don't recommend long-term retention of tulips in small pots as they prefer some more root space, and less competition from each other, in a larger space.  That said, tub grown tulips are also a good option, and they can be removed for storage in summer,  allowing you to plant summer plants instead -  the beauty of bulbs is that they are transportable!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck! Rob

However, most dry cleaning methods leave significant soap residues in the carpet causing rapid re-soiling.(Even if the professional says otherwise). None of the detergents, soaps, surfactants are rinsed and removed from the carpet when dry cleaning method is used. Over time dirt sticks to the soap and cannot be removed by vacuuming. It will also make the carpet fibers stiff and damage the texture and clean-ability over time. We have seen hundreds of carpets destroyed because of all the soap build up over time.<br>  <br>  STEAM CLEANING (aka hot water extraction, steam extraction) IS THE ONLY METHOD RECOMMENDED BY 99% OF CARPET MILLS.<br>  <br>  Most steam cleaning professionals do not leave any residue in the carpet. (make sure they are using a fiber rinse to confirm they are residue free)<br>  <br>  Truck-Mounted units always should be used. They are a ton more powerful than portable equipment and will remove more soil and dry faster. Make sure you confirm they are "Truck-Mounted"<br>  <br>  Hint: Look for a steam cleaning company that dries in less than 8-12 hours and they will have very effective Truck Mounted cleaning equipment. (sometimes professionals will purchase under-powered truck-mounts because of their low cost) A good truck-mount costs $15,000 or more new. We use a $25,000 truck mount which is top of the line.<br>  <br>  IF YOU HAVE PET ODOR: Both dry and steam cleaning WILL NOT remove pet odor. Urine has salts that will not break down from water or carpet cleaning agents alone.<br>  <br>  A blacklight and an enzyme such as Urine Off should be used prior to cleaning. At least 3 days before.

I use Ceramabryte that I buy at Lowe's, they usually have it sitting all over the tops of new appliances, and a razor scraper.  You use it kinda like car wax, squirt a little around then use a paper towel to scrub whatever is on the surface of the stove.  If there are any stubborn places you need to use the scraper to remove them then rub back over with the paper towel.  After it dries you buff it back off with a clean paper towel and it will shine like new.  Occasionally you'll get some really tough stains that may take a second application in those areas.  This stuff really works for me.|`|2gvwTS4aaa	I have had my glass top stove for about 6 years now and always clean it with an SOS pad.

ce415442d6934a8dae96b77ac250825faa	Most people don't transplant bulbs that are actively growing, especially if they have been in a pot for a long time & have formed large shoots (and large roots) already.  They will then wait until the plant has gone through it's growth cycle before transplanting.<br>  <br>  If the bulb hasn't been in the ground too long & is just starting to form shoots, it's possible to carefully transplant the bulbs.<br>  <br>  Since it is already in dirt in your pot, just plant the bulb ...along with the dirt...at the same level it was in the pot. I would water the plant thoroughly the day before taking it out of the pot, so that the soil will cling to the roots that are already starting to form. You really should try to not disturb the roots once they are actively growing. Also try to get as much soil clinging to the roots as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  Don't  bury  the shoots that are already above ground level.<br>  And be careful... because the shoots can easily break off from too much handling.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!

97sKOWQ0aa	1Note: The three factors mentioned here--pH, total alkalinity and calcium hardness--all affect one another, so it will take some trial and error to get all three in the proper range at once. Also note that before you add any chemical--especially an acid--to the water, you need to first turn on the pool's filter. <br>  Step2Use a water-testing kit to measure the calcium hardness (how "hard" or "soft" the water is). The proper calcium hardness is between 200 and 400 parts per million (ppm). <br>  Step3Following package directions, add calcium carbonate dihydrate to raise calcium hardness; add sodium hexametaphosphate to lower it. Carefully pour the chemical mixture into the pool at various spots a foot or two (about half a meter) away from the sides of the pool. <br>  Step4Measure the water's total alkalinity. This figure should be in the range of 80 to 150 ppm; 100 to 120 ppm is best. <br>  Step5Adjust the total alkalinity by adding sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to raise it or sodium bisulfate (dry acid) to lower it. <br>  Step6With a pH tester, measure the water's pH. The proper pH for a pool is in the range of 7.2 to 7.6. <br>  Step7To lower the pH, add sodium bisulfate or liquid muriatic acid. To raise it, add soda ash (sodium carbonate). <br>  Step8Add more chemicals as needed until the water is in balance. <br>  Treating water with chlorine<br>  Step1Scoop chlorine granules into water in a nonmetal container, following package directions. Always wear goggles and rubber gloves when handling chlorine, and always put the chlorine into the water--don't pour the water over the chlorine. <br>  Step2Stir for about 30 seconds, and leave for 30 minutes to settle. <br>  Step3Turn on the filter. Reaching as far into the middle of the pool as possible (perhaps by standing on a diving board), pour the chlorine into the pool. Discard any sediment left in the container. <br>  Step4Add chlorine three to four times a week for a pool in heavy use. <br>  Step5Occasionally--no more than once a week--you may need to superchlorinate (also called shock) the pool to burn any built-up bacteria, algae and ammonia. Following chlorine package directions, make a solution for superchlorination (it will be three to five times as strong as normal chlorine). <br>  Step6Add the chlorine solution to the pool after sundown, if possible, as the sun's rays break down chlorine. <br>  Step7Before allowing anyone to go in the pool, test the residual chlorine level to make sure it has gone back down below 3.0 ppm. This will take at least several hours. <br>  Keeping the water dirt- and debris-free<br>  Step1Remove any leaves from the pool with a leaf net each time you go swimming. <br>  Step2Empty and rinse off the strainer basket of the skimmer once or twice a week, and as often as daily during falling-leaf season. <br>  Step3Keep the deck clean by regularly sweeping and then rinsing it with a garden hose. <br>  Step4Use a cover over your pool as often as possible. <br>  Step5Thoroughly clean your pool filter at least monthly. Clean a sand filter by backwashing: Reverse the flow of water through the filter for 2 to 3 minutes until the wastewater is clear. <br>  Step6For a cartridge filter, remove the filter cartridge and wash it with a hose with a high-pressure nozzle. Replace the cartridge.<br>  <br>  This is what you do after what Mike said to do.<br>  <br>  Or just get a pool boy.|`|bxlYleZkaa	If you really want to keep the frogs DO NOT use bleaches or any other cleaning chemicals or compounds at all!!!!!

I hired a septic tank truck to pump these out for $75.00 to $150.00 and then cleaned then with chemicals. The city would frown on you pumping this crap down the city sewers and would even fine you. This way they can pump the solids also.<br>        Hosing down and chemical cleaning then pumping again will almost totally clean it out. The you can get to the nitty gritties and do a real good job.<br>        I had one pool that was two feet deep, believe that.|`|6nmdvdEraa	About 2 years ago I bought a property with a pool that had not been used for 10 years also. The reason for this was a plumbing leak that the previous owners did not want to fix. With the help of a few friends, we fixed the leak, & cleaned out the pool Then hired a sand blaster & took off the existing faded paint ( It too was a concrete pool) then we bought some pool paint and primer & repainted it, I had to replace the pump and filter, but when we finished it looked like a new pool. So take heart, apart from the pump & filter it was an inexpensive project & well worth the effort of sand blasting & painting rather than just filling it up & hoping you can keep the water balanced.|`|bKVy6Dv3aa	I like what cowboydoc had to say.  Hire someone to pump the pool dry.  Make sure they pump out the drains.  While that's being done, take a good look at the pump and filter system.  Clean all of it as much as possible.  Try to spot any obvious issues such as broken pipes, missing parts, etc.  Turn the pump on for a few minutes to see if it runs.  Once the pool's empty, go after it with a stiff brush and garden hose to loosen any gunk on the walls and floor.  You may want to scrub with a diluted bleach solution.  Examine, or have someone examine, the pool structure for cracks or other structural damage.  Repaint if necessary.  Fill the pool.  Now you can try the pump to see if it's working.  be prepared to replace gaskets and seals on the filter body, pump reservoir, etc.  Clean or replace the filters.  Once you get it working and not leaking take a water sample to a reputable pool supply store and have them test it.  Buy the proper chemicals and follow their advice on using them.  Good luck.  We love our pool and get a lot of relaxation in and around it.|`|yUoa678Gaa	First drain it. Then check for structural damage of any kind. After that you can google pool cleaners and find many that will do the trick but be prepared for a ton of elbow grease work. I've renovated some places and at first I cleaned old pools myself, but in the end it was just easier to have a local contractor come in and fix it up for me. <br>  <br>  I would definitely hire someone to at least come and examine the pool once drained for anything that may cause you problems in the future, once you decide to use it. <br>  <br>  If you decide to clean it yourself call up a bunch of friends and make a party out of it. Trust me, it will get done much faster and you'll have some fun as opposed to sitting in  pit all day scraping and scrounging. :)|`|24dba428d1d5816623c1c35e00a55dceaa	drain and scoop out gunk, scrub with bleach, rinse, fill up and make sure to add chlorine on regular basis for upkeep!

0Ei3ePJzaa	Nightmare neighbours can blight your life, but you can report him, let's face it, you will never have a good relationship with this nut job, so don't worry about your rapport with him, he's never going to get on with you and is obviously doing this on purpose.  You could try asking him, but he is obviously doing this to annoy if you can hear the noises to that degree.<br>  <br>  Although you could fight fire with fire, you will inevitably end up taking the blame for what is essentially his fault, the only way to deal with this sort of scum if by asking your landlord, or his landlord to record the noise levels he is making and getting the freak chucked out.  Whatever they put in his place will never be quite as bad I am sure.<br>  <br>  I had a nightmare neighbour, who insisted on parking over my drive, and sticking his car in front of my house, he got a barn owl in a built up residential estate and it screeched at 2 and 3 in the morning.  He had 5 dogs and never cleaned up the mess, it stank, finally, he let his ferret stress my son's pet rabbits to death. Despite myself, I lost it, and banged on the door and demanded he move his van and car - I demanded the money for the Rabbits or I would involve the police.  I have never felt myself get so angry.  Eventually he moved away and my new neighbours are simply lovely.  Very considerate and just as neighbours should be.

When selling your home you must understand the demographic of your potential purchaser. Then you must consider any flaws or defects you wish to diminish and any assets you wish to accent. You must think about the character of the neighborhood and the standards that exist there. As you can see, a statement or belief such as "neutral" is such a generic approach. I always say you may want to neutralize but you don't want to neuter. Very important difference there...you don't want to strip the home of character.

l9xnybUMaa	So thats four people in one room?  How big is it?  I hope you all can get outside to play alot.  A good designer could pull this off, but it is complex.  You figure out how you need to use the space, Acess what exactly you must have where, and treat it like a boat.  A place for everything and everything in its place, check out ikea for ideas, folding tables hanging shelves lots of great ideas.  Once your storage needs are clear then create multifunction sleeping lounging zones, so you can eliiminate sofas, go to a furniture website and try moving beds around in your room in virtual reality.  Work with it until it works for you this will take time give yourself at least a month to do this.|`|fvuEtkROaa	The biggest thing is to have enough storage so that you can eliminate clutter.  Even the children can be taught to  pick up their toys and put them away. Under bed storage boxes can be a big help, as can wall units for storage.  Think vertical storage.  Good luck.

f96fc627f519f3ac55a4b380b5d54678aa	I am a Chartered Town Planner - you do not always need planning permission; a domestic property normally has permitted development rights.  There are a number of criteria that determine whether or not you need PP (too many to list here).  Initially you may wish to visit the planning portal website below where there is an interactive section for householders.  Before you do anything you a)must contact the planning department (development control section) of your local authority b) put your enquiry in writing to them and await a response.  The permitted development regs changed in October 2008 and they are quite complicated so always seek the advice of a professional if in doubt.|`|abmKhIpoaa	you Always need planning permission get an architect to draw you some plans and a good one will have a good idea what you do in your area without constant resubmissions saving yourself a lot of stress|`|0UAdqkwJaa	If you are in the UK then you will definitely need planning permission for any size extension to your property. The only time you dont need permission is when you are building a separate "temporary" structure that must be made of wood e.g. a summer house or large shed etc.
AA11759897	You will have to replace the motor, or the full head or in some cases the complete valve depending on the make of the zone valve.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The box vibrating sounds like the motor is burn out or a fault with the wiring to it. if you want to check it, turn off electric to boiler and then remove the cover on the 2 port valve. To check the operation of the valve, turn on electric and see if the moter turns the valve when you operate  the water on or off switch.
L8zmQS8Jaa	I am impressed with your understanding of the cycles.  Now you need to understand why some of these things do what they do and then trace it down to the faulty part.  Finally you can hire yourself out as a service mechanic. <br>  <br>  I can't tell you where the problem is located.  In former times there were switches governing the logic.  More often nowadays there is a printed circuit board that performs the function and gives you the fault codes like the one you described.  In both cases there are sensors.  Your problem could be with a sensor that is going bad or with the circuit board.  <br>  <br>  A normal test procedure is to bypass the sensor and then check the functioning of the circuit.  If it works then the sensor is the problem.  However the sensors are safety's.  They are in the circuit to keep things from going boom.  When you don't have a lot of experience things tend to go boom more often.  Sometimes sensors are just loose or out of place.  And sometimes you have to replace the board. <br>  <br>  As you are probably aware, the "high limit fault" is an overheating condition and the blower high speed is an indication of higher heat levels.  A high limit fault should shut down the unit and require a manual reset.

L8zmQS8Jaa	It makes a difference where you are located.  Outside of the US I am less familiar with piping systems.  The use of the word "cistern" suggests that you are outside of the US.  <br>  <br>  Some systems are gravity fed.  The fact that you have "cold water tanks" and that you were looking for an "air lock" suggests that this is likely the way yours is set up.  <br>  <br>  In the US our lines are pressurized by a pump or from pressure as the water comes in.  The lines can be relatively small without a problem.  Where you have gravity fed systems (with a tank or cistern somewhere up high) the pipes should be bigger to accommodate a larger flow to make up for less pressure.  Often they are not.  <br>  <br>  It is a little hard to presume what equipment you may have available.  My first thought is to have you carefully check to make sure all the valves are open from the tanks to the tap.  (Under the sink and follow the piping)  Next you might try to suck the water from the tap with a wet/dry vac (or blow into the lines to clear debris at a tank hole.)  If neither of these work you may have a jammed valve that appears to be open but is actually jammed shut.  The other alternative is that your piping may be corroded shut.  This would be particularly true with galvanized piping.

One that is most resistant to disease, and is highly durable.It all depends on where you live on the type that is best.Also aerate it first to get the roots growing stronger to suck up the excess moisture. Since you have a small yard, dump as much seed within your budget. Make sure to throw straw on top so the birds dont eat it all. And wait til the weather warms a little,maybe mid march or april would be a good time. You will have jack and the bean stalk in no time. Keep it cut high.|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	We've been there, our intact male german shepherd tore up the sod and made a huge mud bed in two large swaths where the electric fence was curbing him.  In our case, we stopped using the electric fence and stopped putting him out in the yard unless one of us was with him.  In the nice weather this was easier but in the cold none of us want to go out much so it does result in more confinement for him but he seems to handle it well.  We reseeded some but some of the worse muddy areas actually healed themselves quite nicely the following spring.  I pulled weeds that came up when I passed by and we had a company mow and do applications regularly and the grass filled back in.   In my opinion, male dogs, once they are adults, are much easier on a yard than females who pee big puddles on your grass all their lives.  Don't listen to people who say you can't have both or are a bad person to want both a grass cover and a dog.  Your dog will get older and chill out and he/she really only wants to be with you.  Our dog has had a crate from day one and he is happy to get in it when we need him to.  I would not dream of leaving the house and leaving a dog uncrated in the house.  Even the best behaved dog could do anything!|`|8cSHWayyaa	It's going to be an ongoing project but you can minimize the damage.  First, is the race track heavily rutted?  If so, you are going to have to level it with top soil so the water doesn't trough.  Does your garage have gutters?  Is it doesn't you are always going to have the rain that falls on the roof transmit to the race track.  If you do have a gutter on the garage, make sure the down spout drains into the area that is least likely to be damaged.  Regarding the turf, most people like blue grass but its durability is way down on the list.  You should be going with a wider blade grass like a fescue/rye mix.  If there is a lot a shade, go with more fescue.  Most company sell this seed as a play or contractors variety.  Check the germination information on the back of the bag.  There are also highway mixtures that are available at most horticulture supply stores.<br>  <br>  When you cut your turf, don't cut your turf below 3.5".  It might be a pain in the rainy season but, assuming that your soil isn't all clay, the larger plants will take in more water and be more able to withstand the race.  It's also important to make sure you have a regular fertilizer program.  The more healthy grass you have, the slower bare spots will appear.  If all else fails, there is always a ring of mulch create a flower bed around the garage.  Good luck!

Underground tunnels are often deep, and the only evidence that moles exist may be mounds of soil (molehills) pushed up to the surface. They are used as highways leading from cavities to feeding areas and are used most during hot, dry, or very cold weather when earthworms and insects move deeper into the soil."<br>  <a href="http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for42/for42.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for42...</a><br>  <br>  To get rid of them, Traps, flooding, and gravel, mesh or concrete barriers can be effective. You'd have to be careful with traps, but maybe you can find a way to place them deep enough into the holes that it would be too hard for pets to get to.

Even the Washington Dept. of Fish & Wildlife site, which nixes the noise-scaring approach & other repellents, actually gives out a Castor oil recipe & after saying: "Commercially available castor oil–based repellents have been scientifically tested on moles in the Eastern United States with some success... then says this about a home-made Castor oil recipe:<br>  "The repellent will be most effective where it can be watered into the moist soil surrounding surface tunnels made by moles. Areas that receive extensive irrigation will quickly loose the repellent to leaching. For best results, spray the entire area needing protection; moles will burrow under a perimeter treatment. The repellent may need to be reapplied before moles depart. Once moles move elsewhere, the solution usually remains effective for 30 to 60 days." <br>  The Recipe:<br>  Using a blender to combine 1/4 cup of unrefined castor oil (can be purchased at most pharmacies) and 2 tablespoons of a dishwashing liquid. Blend the two together, add 6 tablespoons water, and blend again. Combine the concentrated mixture with water at a rate of 2 tablespoons of solution to 1 gallon of water. Use a watering can or sprayer to liberally apply the solution to areas where moles are active.

Grubs make up only a portion of the mole's diet. During dry periods, moles are known to frequent well-irrigated lawns just for moisture. Thus, moles often are present even in grub-free yards. If all the earthworms, grubs, and other soil animals in a lawn are eliminated by repeated insecticide application, moles may be forced to seek other areas. However, the use of soil insecticides is an expensive approach with no immediate reduction of damage and little likelihood of long-term control. In the process, soil insecticides may poison the groundwater, kill beneficial soil invertebrates, and damage songbirds and other desirable wildlife."<br>   <br>  Moles "favor white grubs when they can find them, but earthworms make up roughly 75 percent of a mole's diet."   If you're having trouble with the white grubs that turn into Japanese Beetles ...there are natural organisms (such as  Milky Spore)  that can get rid of those types of grubs.<br>  There is also a mole repellent called Mole-Med that has shown to be somewhat effective in tests at Michigan State University made from castor bean extract . <br>  <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/homes/20010317quest5.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.post-gazette.com/homes/200103...</a><br>  <br>  This is Bob Villa's site with suggestions from members:<br>  <a href="http://www.bobvila.com/BBS/GETTING_RID_OF_MOLES_IN_YARD-Bugs_and_Pests-1-F117.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobvila.com/BBS/GETTING_RID_O...</a><br>  <br>  Trying different approaches is your best chance of getting rid of moles.

You can differentiate ikebana from normal flower arrangement though its design - it is simple, it has defined shape, they are usually very strict in terms of their lines & forms.<br>  <br>  Another difference is that they use only natural things eg not just flower but twigs, stalk, seeds, leaves, wood etc.<br>  <br>  Although Ikebana adopts a minimal look, it is done with a very disciplined & careful eye. <br>  <br>  I find Ikebana is beautiful because I believe that beauty is when it is at its simplest.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	there is 'form' in any arrangement... but FORM is the beauty of Ikebana.... the flower is important, but the form is the heart of it....and it takes a great 'eye' to make the better ones!!..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Ikebana&rls=com.microsoft:en-us&oe=UTF-8&startIndex=&startPage=1&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?q=Ikeban...</a><br>  <br>  the first one on that page is a pretty good example....Ikenobo picture, is, too...<br>  <br>  the other big difference is that the container is part of the arrangement in Ikebana, whereas in regular arranging, it's just holding the water more or less.... <br>  <br>  I would consider Ikebana more of an 'art form' than the usual flower arranging....|`|AA11104893	Contrary to the idea of floral arrangement as a collection of particolored or multicolored arrangement of blooms, ikebana often emphasizes other areas of the plant, such as its stems and leaves, and draws emphasis towards shape, line, form. Though ikebana is a creative expression, it has certain rules governing its form. The main(?) rule is that all the elements used in construction MUST be organic, be they branches, leaves, grasses, or flowers. The artist's intention behind each arrangement is shown through a piece's color combinations, natural shapes, graceful lines, and the usually implied meaning of the arrangement.<br>  <br>  Another aspect present in ikebana is its employment of minimalism. That is, an arrangement may consist of only a minimal number of blooms interspersed among stalks and leaves. The structure of a Japanese flower arrangement is based on a scalene triangle delineated by three main points, usually twigs, considered in some schools to symbolize heaven, earth, and man and in others sun, moon, love & earth. The container is also a key element of the composition, and various styles of pottery may be used in their construction.|`|c01eb38fba09582c78fbc7a2a19baeb0aa	Simplicity.

Xr5bU3t1aa	Start by taking a few courses and getting your Certificate.  If you really like it after that, then find some "design" schools in your area and apply.  You may very well be able to start off just with your Certificate as a Designer.  The credentials seem to be different from state to state.

EmgiGg17aa	You or others have long hair I am assuming.    You wash it in the tub. with lots of shampoo, soap and conditioner.  Right?   You are losing hair.  Which is a natural occurrance.   And you are draining that all down the drain.  Well soap and conditioner and hair make for a nice clump of grunge. which sits in the P trap.  You probably got a good build up of crap  in there.    empty the tub.   If you have one of those chrome plugs that stay in the tub and you press onto to close up the drain - they   unscrew so you can see directly down the drain.  All that should be there is a cross piece of metal like a plus sign and 4 holes (one in each corner)   If you cannot see the plus sign, that is because there is hair grunge right there.  Take your finger with a good nail and stick it in and scoop out the hair ball as much as you can(it is soap, hair and conditioner above the P trap)  Already that is going to help.  Put in trash or toilet.          Then go to the stove and boil up some water(finding the biggest pots you can to make as much boiling water as you can.     Then take water up in the pots and pour a stream from the pot directly into the drain hole from at least standing height....so the hot water pounds down into the drainhole.  This hot water will pound at the soap hair gunge that got past the cross piece and is sitting in the P trap- melting the soap away and forcing it all down the drain into the sewer or septic tank.    Once you have used all the boiling water from all the pots, follow it up by pouring hot water out of the taps and having that go directly down the drain to flush the pipes clean.       Should work normally again.      This most often occurs with single long haired males or females who are lenient with water useage....as not enough is being used to to clean the pipes.    No need for plunger or any harsh chemicals(which just eat out the metal pipes..|`|V9HNzXFuaa	Keep using your cover thing, and once in a while, maybe every few months, run a drain auger (or if you don't have one, a long wire with a hook bent on the end will work) down into the trap and pull out any hair or debris that may be caught in it.  This should keep it from getting completely clogged up|`|WWwm1TgBaa	I agree with one, a pipe snake you can buy at home hardware stores and it will hopefully remove or loosen clog, keep drain strainer in place.  Look for a foam type clog remover .  Or a plumber.|`|07622d05764df8095bb53ff82c523e6daa	You need to ask a plumber what is a safe drain cleaner for that type of plumbing and use it regularly.  It really sounds like you have a major problem that is not being cleared out by the plunger.  You need a cleaner that you can leave in there for quit a while to eat away at the blockage.  Then run the water hard for a while to see if you can flush it on down & out.  If the water backs up again you need a plumber.

iloSQ8lUaa	If you are getting it for looks is fine but if you are getting it for "saving" money dont even waste your time. I read it on other places too but here are few reviews that people wrote on this site http://www.alternativeconsumer.com/2007/...    My husband and I purchased two of these Heat Surge fireplaces and we have seen NO savings on ur electric bill. We turned our thermostat down to 68 degrees for the month, and our electric bill went up. Go figure. Where is the savings at?? They are misleading the public into a ton of savings, and all you have is fireplaces that look good in your home. We purchased these for the saving, but their is NONE! Very dissapointed and would not recommend these unless you want to pay higher electric bills.      Eden Pure finished dead last in Consumer Reports Oct. 2007 report.    If you have access to nat. gas, it takes a lot of discipline to come out ahead by heating just one room at a time with electricity.    Electric heat costs about twice as much per delivered BTU as natural gas in most parts of the USA. One kilowatt hour of electricity supplies 3413 BTU. One hundred cubic feet of gas (almost exactly one therm on your gas bill) is 100,000 BTU. Look up your local prices and do the math. One therm costs about $1.05 right now in the upper Midwest. Divide that by 80% efficiency on a typical furnace = $1.31 per 100,000 BTU delivered. You need 29.3 kilowatt hours to deliver 100,000 BTU (at 100% efficiency). At 10 cents per kilowatt hour, thats about $2.90.|`|2QB90j85aa	there's some in owensboro  don't have links, but i pass one of the amish furniture making companies almost everyday|`|a684462f8e6ac3562a8758d2cf429131aa	I do not own or use one of those things.

Find a comforter he likes that has some of his red in it but not too much.,  Paint the trim and doors a soft sandy shade.  It could look really nice.  Or you could use denim bedding and paint the trim white, for a patriotic look!

P.S.  I saw a You-tube recently of a man who was dying at a young age.  He wanted to thank his parents and loved ones for everything they had done for him.  One thing he thanked his parents for was, believe it or not, always allowing him to decorate his room just the way he wanted it.  It's really not a big deal and will help your son feel important and creative!  No matter how bad you think it looks, tell him that you love it too!

If he's absolutely insistant, try toning it down with navy blue drapes, rugs, and bedding.     One tip, if you do end up painting it red, prime your walls first and add some of the red paint to the primer. Red is a bear to paint with and it takes a million coats if you don't prime with a red tinged primer first.    Good luck, I feel your pain, my daughters room is lime green and hot pink..lol
2fBnlLoeaa	The older the stain the harder it is to remove. If the fabric is white you can bleach out the stain. If the fabric is colored you need to follow these steps. Use a brush and brush of the mold from the fabric, the bristles will loosen up the mold growing in between the fibers. Use a pre-wash spray and rub the soap into the stain. Soak the article in water and detergent for about 30 minutes. Wash with regular laundry detergent. (Borax is a good detergent if available in your area).   Do not use your electric dryer to dry the fabric, lay it in the sun to dry if you can find it.   Artificial heat from the dryer can set the stain even further. The sun has a natural bleaching ability to brighten and whiten cloth. You can also try to soak a colored fabric in lemon juice and water.    You may want to check the humidity levels in your home; make sure it stays below 50 percent. Using your air conditioner can lower humidity levels,(If you have one in UK)  Open window and doors often to get ventilation. Open drawers for few minutes.  If all this doesn't work then you may have to get some new Disco shirts and new spandex UK sense! ;)|`|l8yfpyy1aa	If they are mildew spots, washing them again with a small amount of detergent and chlorine bleach in the wash water will remove the stain, although the mildew may have damaged the fabric.

Although I've never tried them, laundry products with "Oxy" come well recommended.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	a few years!!! there is your answer then lol. if you are going to store clothes they have to be in a an airtight bag.   the spots you have are mildew and very hard to get rid of, if the shirts were pure white you could bleach them but not if there is colour in them. try wetting the spots and sprinkle bicarb of soda on and leave overnight.|`|sSlRzn2iaa	they could be bed bugs research it online
lwMmZY4Xaa	It can range from 150.00 to 350.00 or more depending size and material. If you are replacing old wood windows and the exterior has rot it would be best and less expensive to go back with a new construction wood or composite /wood window. If the frame is not rotten and you want to just replace the sash you can get sash replacement kits from most window companies. You can also use a vinyl replacement window. Down falls to vinyl you are stuck with white or one of the other two colors they offer and you loose daylight opening. Also look at getting low-E glass or other low-E options as well as argon gas. Most manufactures do not charge for argon if you get low-e glass or better options on the glass. please feel free to e-mail if you have any other questions|`|dv3hlHRhaa	It totally depends on the size and type of window you are talking about.

A typical 30 inch wide and 48 inch tall double hung window can be taken out and replaced for about $300.00  You may see adds on billboard for "any window "$197.00    The quality of the window and the quality of the workmanship are usually reflected in the price.|`|vPIxS47Oaa	sorry but it will depend on the kind of the window. if you go with the one that is made of fiber glass (plastic) frame and double fane glass it should not cost much specially if the window size is standard (available on regular hardware store). material

They grow best in moist fertile soil. Bloom cycles are typically four to six weeks. Bougainvillea grow best in very bright full sun and with frequent fertilization, but the plant requires little water to flower. As indoor houseplants in temperate regions, they can be kept small by bonsai techniques.     NOTE: If overwatered, Bougainvillea will not flower and may lose leaves or wilt, or even die from root decay.    It also depends on the degree of frost|`|AA12355632	Leave it in the ground; the top freezes but they are fairly root hardy. Cover with mulch to prevent further damage.

NJULnXiyaa	To convert the outlet you will need a plug in type ground check tester (about $4) ( http://images1.hdpi.com/product_enlarged... ), a roll of green or uninsulated 12 gauge copper wire, a new prong outlet and tools like screwdrivers and a wire stripper, electric tape and mostly likely a work light with extension cord.  First find the circuit breaker for the outlet you are changing and turn off the power and check it with the tester. Remove the plate and then gently pull out the old outlet. Detach the old outlet from the wires and toss it. Take a look inside the outlet box in the wall for a third ground wire. It the box is metal you may not find one and the box itself is grounded. Cut about 6-8 inches of your new ground wire you bought and attach one end (strip off the insulation if necessary) to a metal connection in the box (usually a screw). Attach the other end to the green ground screw on your new outlet. Reattach the hot (black) and neutral (white) wires to your new outlet (either screws or push in holes). It may be necessary to re strip the ends on the wire. At this point I like to wrap electric tape around the whole circumference of the outlet to prevent potential shorts against the metal box. Gently push the outlet back in and turn the circuit back on. Test the outlet with the tester. If its fine, turn the circuit back off and reattach the screws and outlet plate then turn the circuit back on. One down, 20 to go!    -Brian|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	The $4.00 ideal receptacle tester is the first step. Buy it. Plug it into the outlet. WAIT a Minute. They only come in three prong!!!!!!!!!!!   Instead buy a $1.98 dollar tester that lites up. Put one end into one side of the outlte and touch the cover screw with the other tester prong. Then try the other side of the outlet. If the tester lites up, GOOOOOD. If not, buy a GFCI outlet and replace the outlet. This IS a legal way to install a three way to change a two prong to a three prong. Just remember to READ the directions that comes with the GFCI when you install it. Good Luck!!|`|kSyiUxYSaa	Run new wire all the way to the main breaker box then wire in a new socket. It involves more than that though, consult a professional for the work.    Forgot cardinal rule  1 Sweetpea, shut the power off at the breaker box first and test the circuit to be sure it is dead. EXACTLY why I don't give specific advice out like that.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Considering that they are moving away from 3 prong back to 2 prong -3 is old style too.|`|AA10097817	If you mean you want to change the electrical outlets from two prong to three prong, that should be a relatively easy DIY project.    If you remove one of the outlets from the wall box, look inside, & see if there is a bare copper grounding wire attached under a terminal screw at the back, or side of the box.  When you replace the old outlet with a new 3 hole outlet all you have to do is connect at least 6" of AWG 14, or AWG 12 wire between the copper ground in the wall box, & the green terminal screw for the ground on the new outlet. Make sure that your new piece of ground wire is either the bare copper kind, or is coated with green colored insulation if you want to stay within code.  When you connect the other wires (Black, & white) be carefull to connect those to the proper terminals on the outlet.   If you look at the socket portion of the outlet you will notice that of the three holes the U shaped hole is for the ground. With the U at the top you will see the slot on the left is smaller than the slot on the right. The smaller slot (left) is the line side of the socket or where the black wire connects. The right side with the larger slot is the neutral, or where the white wire connects.  Some guys here will tell you to connect the white wire to the silver coloured screws, & the black wire to the brass coloured screws. I find my method of identifying the right place to put the black & white wires a little more foolproof.  Some appliances will still work if you get the wires reversed, but some also ground their metal cases, & you could end up creating a dangerous ground loop if you reverse the black & white wires so be careful.    Changing your 2 prong outlets to 3 prong is a worthwhile, & simple home improvement project.  Happy wiring.
721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa	I have a two year old grandson who is living with me right now, a 5 month old puppy and three cats. I have a sofa that is a little over a year old and for it's young age has had many many pee experiences. You can't see or smell any of the stains thankfully. What I do is use a spray bottle with white vinegar and water. I spray the entire cushion that has been peed on so that I don't get a water ring and spray heavier on the peed on spot. I blot and blot with a towel until I feel I have gotten as much out as possible then if I have time I put a clean white towel on it and sit on it to further absorb wetness. It has worked wonderfully so far. All my accidents have been cleaned up right away though. Except for a cat vomit one that I didn't know about (it came out though). Oh but it did clean an old pee stain on one of my beds that I didn't know had happened. Came completely out! White vinegar is really amazing at removing stains and odors.|`|CypU09Llaa	Use Shout or Resolve a carpet like cleaner then with a bucket of warm water and a sponge(new) just work in the cleaner than just leave it to dry over night,|`|XHnpraaxaa	Best way is to call a professional since they know how to keep care of different materials.

AA10097817	I would paint it a lighter color. Or buy new furniture. It looks like a lot of work.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	too often you would find that the wood under the paint is not 'pretty'... either there's little or no grain or there's several colors of wood in one drawer front, for example, and there's no way to stain that kind of thing a light color and have it look good.... in that second pic, if that's the inside of the drawer front, it is pretty nice on that side.... it's just a roll of the dice..... maybe do the sanding of one drawer front first to see what's under there....     then, too...the frame that the drawers sit in?.. it's apt to be a different wood, too, and  not stain up to suit you.... see, there's a REASON the bed and drawers came painted.... and not 'all wood'.....

a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	If that field was just a hayfield last year, it should be okay to grow on this year.  Even better if it was planted in alfalfa which would have replenished some of the nitrogen that the corn used up.    If you want to be a certified organic grower, you'd have to prove that no chemicals were used on the field for 3 years or more.  But if you're just growing organically for your own use....go for it.    You may find that you'll have to spend some time improving the soil, but if you do that by adding compost and using cover crops, the soil will get better and better each year.|`|MhgLNm3daa	They might have used some pesticides on the hay.  But you could get it certified organic in only three years (possibly two, depending how they grew the hay).    When you buy organic food at the store, the land has probably seen pesticides in the past.  The food you grow will taste better than anything at the organic food store, because it is fresher.      The soil probably needs lots of compost or manure, but old farmland makes great gardens- go for it!|`|AA10097817	In the USA you can call your county extension office for advice.

AKrTZqbKaa	I believe these fans are low voltage supplied by a transformer. Why not look in Radio Shack or some other electronic store as the sell this type of fan in different sizes and cfm's that run on line voltage.|`|I7YwG0Mcaa	Look at the side of the fan near where the wire goes in, it will have written in tiny letters somewhere the appropriate voltage and it will be DC not AC like the wall current. It is probably 5-6 VDC, volts DC, now, find or buy a power supply, not as hard as it sounds, like my cell phone charger that plugs into the wall is a 120 VAC to 12 VDC converter. Any item that has a block type thing that plugs into a wall and then has a cable that plugs from that block into the device is a power supply and written on those is the voltage output, it will say something like 18 vdc, or 5 vdc. You don't have to be exactly right on the mark with this matchup a 5vdc power supply would spin a 6vdc fan. But its best not to hook an extreme mix match like using a 12vdc power supply to power a 6 vdc fan would be bad and possible fire hazard. Okay now cut and strip the two wires on the fan, cut the cord coming from your plug in power supply and strip those wires. Twist the red wires together and twist the black wires together and use electrical tape to tape them up separately. Don't stress, with most motors if you get the wires reversed it will just make the fan spin in the other direction it won't explode and kill you, but it is very important that the two bare wires not touch each other, hence the electrical tape. If you don't want to use a power supply you already have laying around or if you can't find one that is the right VDC you can go get them in almost any voltage at radio shack.

Water is added until just below the levels of the levelers and either measured or adjusted with the addition of water and adjusting until just right. With a concrete box the same adjusters are used or it was adjusted by hand and sealant until level. This method for the concrete boxes was not at all as precise as the plastic box methods.

DKJ8sjxVaa	I would invest in a programmable thermostat- you can get a decent one for about $50 at Home Depot, I believe, and they really save you money!  70-72 degrees is pretty warm for the winter, I set mine around 67-69 when people are home, and at night and while we're at work it's about 65-66.    Also, you can get good weather-stripping at HD/ Lowes for pretty cheap, and install it on your front & back doors, maybe on some windows, too. Next you can do a little more caulking on any windows if you can feel any breeze- a tube of caulk is super cheap and there are tons of videos on you-tube that'll teach you how to use it if you need them!  These are the things I did this last fall, and my heating bill went from $180 last Feb (a SERIOUSLY cold month here in Michigan) to just about $100 last month- which was even colder than last Feb!|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	-depends on your system and how efficient it is, but with just the given information, I would set it on 68 degrees all day and dress warmly.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	umm, you dont turn it off. all the money it will cost to heat it back up from when its an icebox will cost you more. I suggest you check your rooms make sure there isnt an adjuster in every room. I was wonderin what was happening to mine when it went up. It was turned up in another room. (i have 3 temp changers and i just live in a small 1 bedroom). So check to see how many you on. Usually you only need one on or the ones which rooms you are in constantly. And 70 is pretty high. in the winter i would go under 70 and get some blankets. I dont care if you have family, if they dont pay the heating bill who cares. If its stays at around 67, trust me, your heating bill will be low. And ofcourse the obvious no leaving windows open, quit going in and outside the house or leaving the door open. And watch it, if you have somebody in your house, and it changes, get on them and tell them not to change it. i have no clue other than that, my electric and heating bill is the same and i only pay 40 bucks a month.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	Don't turn it off as it could cool down too much.  It is best to invest in a set back thermostat.  One that will turn the heat down during the night, turn it back up for a few hours in the morning before you leave for work, turn it down when you leave, turn it back up before you get home  and repeat the cycle when you go to bed.  Some have separate settings for the weekends etc.      But be aware that if you set it too low during the "off" periods it will actually cost more by making your furnace work extra hard to get back up again.  It is best  to maintain around 68 F during "on " periods  (wear a sweater) and not lower than 60 F during the "off" periods.  Just a few degrees can make a huge difference in your annual heating bill.|`|dv3hlHRhaa	It's best in the long run to leave it at b/t 68 and 70 degrees and in the evening when the tem. drops some, I just put on an extra sweater or sweat shirt.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Leave it on 68 degrees all day; don't turn on and off.

Wash clothes in cold water (really cuts on my power bill).|`|IoclNe4paa	i turn mine off when i leave but then i start the fireplace before i turn the heater on in the house.

Any signs of cracking plaster or sheetrock joints? Unfortunately it hard to say, but if it is rental property the landlord has to conform to local codes. As rental property falls under Commercial guidelines. I'm sure that although annoying the building should be ok. At least its not next to an airport with the vibration and add the noise. About all that you can do is to check all door & window hardware to be sure they are all snug. Level and shim all appliances, and there is nothing that you really can do for the floors. I also live right on a main road, and believe it or not it won't be long before you won't even notice it much any more.  Good luck and hope that you will be able to enjoy your new home soon.
944iJNAdaa	I don't think you're going to find a website for this.      But, I'll tell you how to do it.  Keep bringing in dump truck loads of shale until the mud stops oozing up and the rock is spread pretty much evenly.  If you have a cat, run it up and down a few times over the shale to mush it all in to the mud, and to level it out as best as possible.  Then, top with 3/4" minus rock, or granite, to smooth and finish leveling.    You could do all this with a shovel, I suppose, but it's going to be a pretty labor-intensive project.  Otherwise, the bigger the equipment, the easier.  Also, the better for mashing rock into the mud.  I imagine the size of equipment most people would use is what keeps this job from being more of a DIY type project.
