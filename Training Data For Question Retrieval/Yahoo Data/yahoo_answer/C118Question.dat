Just a few quotes:       "A new lawsuit is challenging Barack Obama's eligibility to be president, and this one targets Congress as a defendant for its "failure" to uphold the constitutional demand to make sure Obama qualified before approving the Electoral College vote that actually designated him as the occupant of the Oval Office."          "It is being brought on behalf of Charles F. Kerchner Jr., Lowell T. Patterson, Darrell James Lenormand and Donald H. Nelson Jr. and names as defendants Barack Hussein Obama II, the U.S., Congress, the Senate, House of Representatives and former Vice President Dick Cheney along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi."         "Perhaps the most perplexing detail, however, has been Obama's refusal to allow the public release of a signed "vault" copy of his original birth certificate."            I cannot include the link I got this from because YA tends to delete questions with links.        I will be happy to send you the link if you ask.

My point is to try to show people that by ignoring this killing we are just helping the oppressor take control of the oppressed. We are in a way part of this genocidal event if we do not teach people it and try to prevent anymore senseless killing      if you have any feedback, anecdotes or whatsoever, i also need a list of all the Genocides that took place even those that we consider as not.      Nanking is not considered genocide by some but it was a pillage of China by Japanese soldiers who killed and rapped China..      Please any help is accepted. God knows, this might reach its way to the UN, to someone else that good help. The internet is a powerful tool and we must inform people.

20090131180046AA4IcNJ	Politics & Government;Immigration	How can Houston say police department should continue to avoid responsibility for enforcing immigration laws?	Three presumed candidates for Houston mayor told Hispanic leaders Saturday that the police department should continue to avoid responsibility for enforcing immigration laws.      “The law we are talking about is federal law, and we do have federal officers enforcing that law,” Councilman Peter Brown said.      City Controller Annise Parker said, “We are not in the immigration law enforcement business.”      And former City Attorney Benjamin Hall III told the audience of more than 100 elected officials, business executives and community leaders that police have no right to question city residents about their immigration status based on “the way a person looks externally.”      U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents check the immigration status of suspects jailed by police, but the Houston Police Department does not detain anyone solely on the suspicion of being an illegal immigrant.      The city is thought to be the home of hundreds of thousands of people who entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas.      Nine months before the mayoral election, the almost-official contestants took a wide range of questions from a group spearheaded by lawyer Vidal Martinez.      Brown, Parker and Hall agreed with Martinez that the city should get to work now on creating two new district seats on the 14-member city council.      Is there no accountability by any State, county or city government for demanding taxpayers, cover the costs for any illegal alien family that breaks our laws?So correct me if I'm wrong but don't  mayors, governors, etc. take an oath to enforce  laws? I don't think the oath says only the laws they like.  http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metr...

The regulations created a cap-and-trade system, similar to proposed federal global-warming measures, by limiting the CO2 that utilities, trucking companies and other businesses can emit, and imposed steep new taxes on companies that exceed the caps.

20090131183750AAva1zh	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do I have rights when subletting?	The person I rented out to turned out to be a roommate from hell. He has really made me uncomfortable. He has made suggestive remarks, and always stares at me and the other day he was crying because of stress and because he missed his daughter. He then asked me to lie down with him in his bed! I think he has some issues and I am very mad at myself for finding out AFTER. I have a 13 year old daughter who says she feels uncomfortable around him and after what's going on, I just feel very weird having him in our house. He also is behind in his rent.   Even though there is no signed lease and I rent the house, can I just tell him to leave because he has made us very uncomfortable and leary?   If I do have to give him 30 days, I won't for the sake of our wellbeing.

20090131181834AAUiOKn	Politics & Government;Politics	How can you hate government handouts but also want us to stay in Iraq?	We give handouts to the Iraqi people. Shouldn't they be independent? Learn how to be able to produce for themselves, instead of whining about their country and asking for more foreign aid? They have a massive surplus, and yet still are demanding our aid to them. Do you really want your tax dollars going to some foreign country?       Oh, and before people answer with saying something like 'Obama is also giving money to other countries', keep in mind that two wrongs don't make a right. Even if Obama is blowing all our money also, the fact remains that during the Bush administration we wasted a lot of money on handouts, and still are to this day.       So how can you hate the one and approve of the other? You care more about 'terrorists' (because that's what they all are, right?) and yet not care about American people?

That shoe statue was not hurting anyone, it was a symbol of disdain towards Bush, but it wasn't dangerous. Simply an expression, just like a confederate flag. I do not consider confederate flags or Nazi signs in it of themselves harmful. What do you think?

20090131191454AAv3Yj8	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do Republicans and cons think that the really wealthy work hard for their money?	It seems like every conservative is quick to say that the poor are just poor because they are lazy and unintelligent and that they need to work hard like rich people to get rich.      It seems like rich people just live off their investments and other people's hard work.  They own business so they are entitled to the money but they don't necessarily do any hard work other than holding the deed(s) of ownership.  Very few people who are rich have to work hard.      the lower and middle class work the hardest, but Republican policy has contributed to the shrinking and shrinking of the middle class.      Are Republicans and cons just confused or are their withholding information about the whereabouts of these "hard working" rich people?

20090131185932AAC5lW9	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why do Judges have the right to bypass federal law and put citizens at risk by violent criminals.?	Limp wristed Judges and Lazy Prosecuters are putting people at risk and gun ownership in a bad light for law abiding citizens. I read the paper and time after time armed robberies are reduced to simple robbery, armed assaults reduced to simple assault, why are criminals using guns being allowed to plea down. Federal Law is that use of a firearm in a felony is automatic 10 yrs, carrying a firearm by a felon is 10 yrs, attempt to buy a firearm by a felon 10 yrs. They say gun violence is an epidemic, well they said that about drugs and took the descretion away from Judges that dropped the amount down just to get a conviction. Mandetory sentencing was directed, why isn't this done for gun crimes, is this political so they can make everyone pay? An armed robber dropped to simple robbery gets about 19 months half that for good behavior, then back on the street. Is that where you want them? There is no good time in Federal prison, and would the criminal be so anxious to get that 80 bucks from 7-11 if he faced 10 years if caught? If he killed your daughter or father or other family member knowing he was in jail and charged with a gun crime but out in 9 months would you be outraged? I am.
20090131184557AAb8nAB	Politics & Government;Politics	Which one of Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals does Obama use the most?	1. "Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have."    2. "Never go outside the expertise of your people. When an action or tactic is outside the experience of the people, the result is confusion, fear and retreat.... [and] the collapse of communication.    3. "Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)    4. "Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules. You can kill them with this, for they can no more obey their own rules than t he Christian church can live up to Christianity."    5. "Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage."    6. "A good tactic is one your people enjoy."    7. "A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. Man can sustain militant interest in any issue for only a limited time...."    8. "Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose."    9. "The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself."    10. "The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition. It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign."    11. "If you push a negative hard and deep enough, it will break through into its counterside... every positive has its negative."    12. "The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative."    13. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  In conflict tactics there are certain rules that [should be regarded] as universalities." Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.)

White House Lawyers Look to Limit Commercial Use of President      Julianna Goldman – Fri Jan 30, 4:16 pm ET   Featured Topics:       Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Barack Obama’s popularity makes him a marketer’s dream. Now, the honeymoon may be over for those trying to profit from his appeal.       White House lawyers want to control the use of the president’s image, recognizing the worldwide fascination about Obama’s election, First Amendment free-speech rights and easy access to videos and photos on the Web.       “Our lawyers are working on developing a policy that will protect the presidential image while being careful not to squelch the overwhelming enthusiasm that the public has for the president,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.       Obama’s calls for change and his “Yes We Can” campaign mantra are being evoked to sell assembly-required furniture in Ikea’s “Embrace Change” marketing campaign, bargain airfares during Southwest Airlines Inc.’s “Yes You Can” sale and “Yes Pecan” ice cream at Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Inc. shops.       “I can’t remember this ever happening to an active politician before, as a spokesperson or as an image for a brand,” said Brad Adgate, director of research for Horizon Media Inc., a New York-based advertising agency. “He’s in the highest profile of any person in the world right now.”       Riding the wave of Obama’s popularity may become a concern when advertisers use his likeness without permission to imply that Obama is endorsing a product or cause. The White House through the years has objected to commercial use of presidential faces, such as footage of President George H.W. Bush in a Cold War-themed 1989 television ad for cold medication.       Presidential Speeches       The National Education Association is running a TV ad with excerpts from a speech Obama gave on July 5, 2007, with the group’s logo behind him.       The educators’ group has previously shown remarks by Obama in Web videos and is confident the president shares a “clear and longstanding” commitment to “real change and real reform in education,” said Steve Snider, NEA’s manager of advertising and broadcast services.       The Web site for McKinstry Co., a Seattle-based mechanical contractor that Obama visited during last year’s presidential campaign, features a YouTube clip of Obama praising its work improving energy efficiency at schools and office buildings. “As president I’ll use companies like McKinstry as a model for the nation,” Obama says. McKinstry spokeswoman Genevieve Guinn said the company bought rights to the video and hasn’t gotten any White House complaints.       Obama’s face is on a full-page newspaper advertisement by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying group in Alexandria, Virginia.       Burning Coal       “We figured out how to put a man on the moon in 10 years,” the ad quotes Obama as saying last August. “You can’t tell me we can’t figure out how to burn coal that we mine right here in the United States of America and make it work.” The group also began running a TV ad in December that shows footage of Obama promoting clean-coal energy during a campaign event last September.       The clean coal lobby group told Obama representatives about the ads before the inauguration and received no signals from them that there was any discomfort,      As a record-setting crowd jammed Washington earlier this month for Obama’s inauguration, Obama’s face was featured on thousands of t-shirts, coffee mugs and calendars for sale at stores and street vendors across the capital. Obama’s official inaugural committee got into the act, too, setting up its own memorabilia store.       Malia, Sasha Dolls       Since the Obamas moved into the White House, Michelle Obama objected to the sale by Beanie Babies-maker Ty Inc. of dolls with the same names as her daughters. The company said the Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia dolls weren’t modeled after the first daughters.       A search for Michelle Obama’s name on Google Inc.’s Web site brings up an online ad for J. Crew Group Inc., which got free publicity when the first lady wore a J. Crew outfit on NBC’s “Tonight Show With Jay Leno” last October. “Inauguration Style: Get Looks Like Those Worn by the First Lady” the Web ad says.       Psaki wouldn’t provide details about legal options the White House counsel’s office is considering to deal with commercial use of Obama’s likeness.       The White House lawyers may have to make case-by-case determinations about the best ways to protect the presidential image without tempering enthusiasm or trampling on free-speech protections, said Jonathan Band, an intellectual property lawyer in Washington.       “It will be difficult,” Band said. “Because he is the president of the United States and there was this campaign and everyone’s proud, I think the First Amendment will be applied much more broadly with respect to people wanting to use an image of the president than it would be with

A coalition of Latino groups sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano this week urging her to stop workplace immigration raids.       The coalition  which includes the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Funds  said the raids were a relentless attack on the Latino community.     The fear of raids in and around schools, neighborhoods and workplaces among immigrants  unauthorized and authorized  keeps our children and families from attending schools, obtaining needed services for which they are eligible and pay taxes and even contacting local police when they or their loved ones are in danger, the letter said.    It also said that the raids have destroyed families and spread terror.    The Bush administration conducted a string of large immigration raids at workplaces over the past few years.

20090131195432AA0ABsz	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do we have to use 1003 Loan Application when we purchase residential house?	Hi    Year 2006 I purchased house ($625K). I hired mortgage broker and he applied loan for me. BB&T was my lender and loan was approved in 20 days. I put $125K for deposit and got $500K loan. Last year one of my friend told me that BB&T is not a wholesale lender. There must be a loan officer. I was wondering because from the begging to the end I was contacted by my mortgage broker. He was acting like BB&T was a wholesale lender.    I requested full documents from the lender and I reviewed it. When I saw Loan Application I was confused because it was not 1003 Loan Application. It was Bank’s Retail Loan application. I am not sure but I think that retail loan application is for personnel loan, student loan, or home equity loan etc NOT FOR RESIDENTIAL PURCHASE LOAN… * I said I am not sure.   And my loan is-5 years Installment loan- That means I pay $3400 for 59 months and 60th I have to pay about $400K. On settlement day I was out of town and mortgage broker told me that my father could sign the settlement documents if I give him on authorization (Power of attorney). So we did. I believe my father didn’t know what he was signing.   Q.1 They (Lender) don’t have to use 1003 when we apply for residential home loan?   2. Is there any violation that I was not contacted by Bank’s Loan Officer or others from the Bank?   3. What do you think about my loan program?   4. Refinancing is my best solution?      P.S. When I applied loan, mortgage broker got all my information on blank paper. He said “I will fill loan application out for you”.   I called mortgage broker….NO ANSWER   Heard rumor that he went to jail.      Thanks.

20090131200208AA5E8pa	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is Abortion nothing more than population control?	It seems most everyone is against something like population control, but wants to protect a woman's right to abort her unborn child. Has our government and our media simply convinced us to perform our own population control, so they don't have to force it on us? I'm simply asking you to look at the issue from another angle besides the traditional ones, because it seems that any government-supported anything only has one purpose: to make government stronger. I have never seen one government program that has truly helped humanity (except maybe a tax cut). And any abortion organization, such as planned parenthood, who would continually seek to make abortions easier and put no effort into preventing unwanted pregnancies in the first place, does not really have the mother's best interest at heart. I sense a deeper, more sinister motivation that is cold enough go as far as to kill a child right in front of the mother, after a botched abortion, simply because the child has already been marked to die. My final part of this question would be, especially to all the supporters of abortion: Are you fully aware of what are you really supporting?

Let's stop political payoffs with the 819 billion pork bill while pretending it will create 4 million jobs ($205,000 per hypothetical job created)      Instead let's do this:      Make 4 million small business loans in the amount of $205,000, if that is not enough , reroute TARP funds(the other 350 billion) and loan the same amount to 2 million more small businesses.

Most of you said it can't be fixed and some of you assumed I was speaking of entitlement and some of you assumed that I was black and talking about Obama. In my question I also asked "How many people today look at any group and say "they're the problem" or "if we just got back at them things would be better", and even " everything is their fault" ?"       I'm mostly caucasian and a libertarian. I don't believe in entitlement nor did I vote for Obama. I wasn't even talking about the government doing anything. I was asking if it was to late for us as individuals to fix the hatred and bitterness we each have with certain groups.       It was clear that answerer's were against racism, but many didn't even realize the stereotyping and assuming they were doing, or the underlying animosity that was in their words.       So I'll ask it more plainly this time. Is it to late for us as individuals to fix the bitterness and hatred we each have toward ANY kind of group, or are we to controlled by the politicians and the media to care about anything other than stereotypes

20090226071219AAdJzhL	Politics & Government;Politics	Does this help you stimulus supporters understand?	I understand the politics, I do. For many of us though, this is really not about politics. It is about our future, your future.      We can disagree on politics all day long, it doesn't help anything. We should at least be able to agree on what "pork" is or is not, but the past few weeks I am questioning that as well.      But I digress...      I received an email with a link to the "projects" in the stimulus bill. Or to be more accurate, the state/local proposed projects. Being somewhat able to utilize common sense effectively, I have been skeptical of this bill for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is the fact it is difficult to find anyone who doesn't have skin in the game agreeing this is a good idea.      Here's the link:         http://www.stimuluswatch.org/project/by_...       So I took a look at Kalamazoo, MI...just click on MICHIGAN and then in the cities section click on Kalamazoo. I browsed down the list, noting the jobs each project is projected to create.      I noticed a huge one...1000 jobs! Wow that's great! Neat! Wonderful, that is soooo good. And it only costs $3 million. What a bargain, what a deal.      Oh, wait a sec...dag nab it, common sense is putting a damper on this one....it is for the purchase of 100 Hybrid vehicles. "So what?", you ask.      Well how is this going to "create" 1000 jobs, or even save them?      The jobs are already there. This purchase represents about 3 hours worth of production. Lets say it equals 3 months, just to be incredibly conservative.       Here's a link that talks about GM production rates in excess of 30 vehicles an hour, I know from experience they can do more, but here it is:       http://www.autoblog.com/2009/02/03/gm-in...       OK.      So what happens after that?      Do you people who think this bill actually does anything meaningful understand we do not oppose this based on politics? MOST of us also opposed TARP. Under Bush. You can spin it how you like, but we did. This is not about politics for us.

20090131175602AAtKzva	Politics & Government;Politics	I really want your opinion on what I have to say about abortion ?	I want to make it perfectly clear that it is not my desire to see women dying because of illegal abortions gone wrong because of bad medical treatment    But I really wish there was AT LEAST less of them... Some people are against sexual education saying it doesn't prevent teens from having sex. But that is silly because preventing teens from having sex isn't the point of having sexual education. It's to teach them the consequences of their acts, teaching them about contraception, teaching them about abortion.     Girls and women have abortions without always knowing or fully realizing what they are actually doing, often times they are very distressed, other times they rationalize and forget but they don't UNDERSTAND. A lot of people don't know it but women who had a or a few abortions sometimes feel a great great deal of regret later on in life, something they find hard to bear, I bet some men too. Not all though, of course some people blond themselves on the facts their whole lives.    If it's so important to keep the right to abort then why don't teachers talk about it in school, why is it such a dirty little secret ? I bet people wouldn't be so irresponsible about beings who didn't get the right live, who didn't get their say. They would use contraception because they wouldn't want to have to do something so bad.

20090226073638AAnXIQL	Politics & Government;Government	Is this the true democratic principle?	This idea just popped into my head when I was talking politics with a buddy of mine, and it makes complete sense to me.  I will explain why, fundamentally democrats cannot want this country to prosper or its people prosper.  Democrats always push they are here for the little people, the less fortunate.  They want everyone to have a chance at the american dream, have a small business, make good money, have a great job, and benefits.  Here is the problem with that.  If the majority of the less fortunate got that message, and achieved the american dream, made good money, had that big house and nice car....they would realize they can't vote for a democrat anymore.  Democrats always need the poor to stay poor and the middle class to always feel they are getting the shaft because if those 2 groups ever made more money or had a better life THEY WOULDN'T VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS!  So please, you lefties out there explain how you can be for all of this "prosperity for the less fortunate" when you really mean "please just keep voting for us so we can keep you down and just tax the rich and let them pay for what you need."  Look at all the big city governments...Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, LA,...they are very high in poverty and all have had democratic leadership for a long time, and things are still the same.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  You poor and middle class, you are being played.  They don't want you to be successful, the democrats just want your vote.

Today my 8 year old son was riding his scooter around the block and he came running in to let me know that the man in a house was taking a picture of him as he was riding down the road with his cell phone.The house that he pointed out to me is on the national registry online for a registered sex offender and his crime was child molestation. So I called the police and told them that I am a little uneasy about him taking a picture of my son and does not sound good. Basically they said they cannot do anything about him taking a picture and they cannot just gop up and accuse him of tking a picture because he has rights and it is not illegal. And asked why I had a car come out for this that this was not a matter to call police on. I felt like the one who is wrong  and I even called my husband first to tell him at work and he told me to call the police.I understand it may be nothing but if it had well at least I know my son listens and does come to me and tells me if anybody approaches him talks to him or anything else he feels is strange.I also told him that he done the right thing to come to me and to continue to do so and reenforced not talking to strangers.

Not only did he not prove his point about the police conduct, but he also got convicted of a wiretap violation.

20090131191746AAgtYJw	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this simply pure propaganda for this "green job" sham? Why is it on Y! homepage?	The **potential** of green jobs:       http://green.yahoo.com/blog/greenpicks/2...       So, what exactly is a "green collar" job, and more importantly, how do you get one? There's no definitive term just yet, but here's the short answer according to Pete Altman at the Natural Resources Defense Council: "A green job is just like a regular job only the result of what you are making or doing is good for the environment."      And, it turns out that what's good for the environment is going to be good for America's workforce. A reportfrom the University of Amherst Massachusetts says that a $100 billion investment in green programs would create about two million jobs over two years. About 750,000 green jobs already exist, according to a 2008 U.S. Conference of Mayors' report.         compare to:      The **actual nature** of green jobs:       http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12333650...       Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was all smiles in 2006 when he signed into law the toughest anti-global-warming regulations of any state. Mr. Schwarzenegger and his green supporters boasted that the regulations would steer California into a prosperous era of green jobs, renewable energy, and technological leadership. Instead, since 2007 -- in anticipation of the new mandates -- California has led the nation in job losses.      The regulations created a cap-and-trade system, similar to proposed federal global-warming measures, by limiting the CO2 that utilities, trucking companies and other businesses can emit, and imposed steep new taxes on companies that exceed the caps. Since energy is an input in everything that's produced, this will raise the cost of production inside California's borders.

Alright I'll try to sum this up as best I can, basically I've been wanting to join the marines since I was 13, I'm now 21 and have run into some problems and made a few poor choices since then, nothing involving being arrested or committing any felonies or other major crimes but mostly school related.      when I was 16 I dropped out of school when I lived with my dad because since I was 12 he always told me I never had to go to school if I didn't want to and at that age I think most kids like to think everything their parents tell them is right and of course I did and missed allot of school back then and got held back a year but then when I got to the 9th grade I dropped out completely when I started smoking marijuana and my dad didn't care to take me to school because he was stoned most of the time like me and the school was too far to walk and no buses came around where we lived.      So anyway I quit smoking marijuana 2 years ago and moved with my mom when I was 18 and ended up being a maid sort to say, cleaning the house day and night and otherwise not doing much else, I got my first job when at 19 and have been saving up for no real reason and now that I'm 21 I'm full of regret and disappointment feeling like I let everything I dreamed of go and right now Im just looking to get my foot in any door that will help me achieve my goal of joining the marines.      I heard you need a HS diploma to join and some amount of college credits I believe someone told me and I have neither so my main question is if someone can tell me what my first step should be because I'm lost and confused right now and want to make something of myself and prove myself and others who doubt me wrong and hope to serve my country.      Can I still get a HS diploma as this age?      If so where should I go or who should I contact about doing so?      Are online schools that offer GED or HS diplomas legit?      If so do they need to be accredited? And would anyone be able to give me names of some, hopefully ones you yourself have had experience with. FYI I would prefer an online school because of my location but I'm looking into a few local county colleges atm to get some questions answered but until then I'd like some other opinions.

Along with those 19,000 Muslim refugees, the U.S. will legally immigrate 1.2 million other third world immigrants from dozens of countries. Criminal migrants arrive at over 1.1 million annually.

20090131181050AAQOLkD	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Trip and Fall down the steps in a Law Office. (In Florida)?	I was a contract worker that trip and fell down the steps while carrying a computer from the second floor to the first. I believe that the phone cord which I trip from was taped there by one of their workers and they have put it back after my accident which has cause permanent injuries. Accident happened on 07/06/07 and was still there on 07/09/07 taped back even after the manager and two paralegals where informed on the day of the accident. I had one of my co-workers take a camera phone picture on 07/09/07. I have contacted 40 plus attorneys in my state and they are willing to take my case until I tell them who I’m going after, another law firm which doesn’t help my situation. They know them, know of them, or don’t want to take the chance in going after them because of their reputation in my state.       What are my options? I know that the statute of limitation is of concern.      How much does it worth?      Is punitive damage possible?  Since they violated some building code somewhere and even after they have been notified of the situation, they have failed to correct the issue instead, placing it back to the same location.

The United States has one of the worst health care systems (cost/care wise) in the free world. France, Britain and Canada all have affordable or free health care and prescriptions for their citizens.

20090131191409AAwIE0M	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Serious Civil Matter?	I live in the state of IL and I need to know something.  My 29 year old cousin moved in with us a little over a year ago after his uncle died because he didn't have anyone to basically take care of him.  When I say take care of him, I mean by helping him get a job, getting him food stamps, etc.  We moved him in with us and he did not pay any rent, bills, buy groceries...nothing.  We paid for everything including things he wanted.  Cigarettes, alcohol, clothes, fast food, movies, even gave him money to go out on.  He had a Vespa scooter that he actually bought and paid for himself when he lived with his uncle.  When he moved in with us, he brought it with him.  He did not have the scooter licensed with plates, nor did he have a driver's license.  He did not have the extra money to get plates put on it.  Not only that, but he would not have been able to pass a driver's test for any kind of vehicle because he had a little trouble reading.  He was riding his scooter down our sidewalk one day and a cop drove by and stopped him on it in front of our house.  The cop asked for a license and also asked why he didn't have plates on it.  He told him he didn't think he had to have plates.  Anyways, the cop told him that he had to park it until he got a license and plates.  My cousin got really angry and just said to me "if I can't drive the thing, then I'll just sell it to someone who can."  We put an ad up on Craigslist for him and sold it for $900.00.  The people came to check it out, test drove and everything with my cousin standing right there.  He signed the back of the title and gave it to them.  He did not have a checking account, so the check was made out to us and we cashed it for him.  He was given the money with stipulations that part of it would be going to us to help with rent and the bills that month.  He agreed.  He gave us some of the money and he got the rest.  Anyways, he no longer lives with us due to money issues.  We kicked him out because he refused to help with anything and it was getting bad because bills that he was helping to accumulate were piling up.  We no longer could afford to support him.  Today, he received a letter from the place he bought the bike from stating that he didn't pay his taxes on the bike.  He sent it to his father and his father called me cussing me out stating that he was going to get me for fraud and theft.  My cousin told him that we sold the bike and took all of the money and never gave him any of it.  What I want to know is if I can seriously get into trouble because I cashed that check, even though it was written to me.  It was written to me to cash because he did not have a bank account to cash it at.  We did give him part of the money in lue of the aggreement that part of it would go to help us with rent and bills for that month.  We're being threatened by his father to be prosecuted for theft.  I want to know if I can get into trouble for this.      Also, if a any type of vehicle bought from a dealership is not completely paid for including taxes, how would he have been able to receive the title??

SCHIP Bill: Top 10 Changes for Congress to Consider      Congress's mad dash to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) fails to correct the serious flaws buried in last year's SCHIP bill.   The new SCHIP bill would not only make comprehensive health care reform more difficult; it would also directly undercut President Obama's promise to end special interest earmarks. Once Congress creates a new government benefit, it would be very difficult to reverse course. In this case, Congress would be taking more healthy lives out of the private health insurance pool, thus reducing private coverage, increasing taxpayer burdens, and undercutting the ability of the private sector to maintain or expand coverage later.       http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthC...

20090131194332AAlBwN1	Politics & Government;Elections	Will Obama be able to fix the fall out of the inflation bubble with the buy american plan?	In the last 15 years imports have roase 1500% while exports dropped 11000%.The credit debt of Americans has increased along the same lines as there are fewer dollars from GDP going to workers. This meant consumption went up and industry went down. This could be compared to a poor man with baloon loan except it was the retail buisness buying jets and outsourcing customers at the same time.      When you send more then half of your growth to another country it baloons faster then a bad loan. When it fills to much with inflation and credit debt it pops. Then you have no industry, the retailer have a smaller cutomer base, and the banks have more debt then equity.      The only solution that works is to rebuild what every enemy in the world fears American industry and are workers so much better that when even threaten it the crooks around the world scream in fear.       We need to tax non American made goods in stores to make the consumer not want to buy them.

I personally think it will last another couple hundred years, and then we get extremely bad leadership leading to it's downfall.      They are already speculating that China will be a Superpower in 20 years.      And remember, people, we(Americans as a whole)are merely a dot on the timeline of existence and what's to come for the planet Earth. In essence, I'm asking if on the grand scale of things(not the next 4 years, Repubs) that the ideas of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness will be around in the year 40454(the far future)?      It's just a question, people, don't bite my head off. If you don't want to think about the end of freedom(in the FAR future) then simply don't answer.

20090226075340AAgQbKw	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do democrats refuse to investigate their own corruption?	The House voted Wednesday to kill a resolution calling for an ethics investigation into potential quid pro quo between lobbyist campaign donations and lawmakers.      Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., sponsored the proposal that would have forced the House Ethics Committee to launch a probe into ties between the source and timing of campaign contributions by lobbyists and subsequent legislator requests for special projects or earmarks.      Flake's resolution was a direct response to the ongoing federal investigation into the PMA Group, a lobbying company accused of making fraudulent donations to lawmakers using names of people who did not exist.       The firm, which has contributed millions to politicians in the last decade, has close ties to senior Democratic appropriators including Reps. John Murtha D-Pa., and Pete Visclosky,D-Ind. The FBI raided PMA's headquarters in November and is investigating the group's founder and president, Paul Magliochetti, a former Murtha aide.      "The vote came just after the House approved a $410 billion spending to fund the government this year, which also contained $8.8 million on projects sought by client of the PMA lobbying group.      "Our own ethics committee may say that's OK. The Department of Justice may see it another way," Flake said following the vote. "Until we bring our Ethics Committee guidelines in line with the Justice Department, our members are exposed."      Asked why he voted with the majority to table the resolution,  Murtha said, "no comment. "

20090131200645AAnuro0	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Aggressive men came to my door, so my roommate had a Gun in her hand just in case. Can she get in trouble?	My roommate and I are both females and there was these two door to door salesmen who looked really creepy looking. So I didn't feel comfortable opening the door, so I just told them through the closed door very nicely that we weren't interested and do not accept solicitors. But then they start cussing and saying under their breath "These F'N weird people, stupid B!ches can't even open the damn door" while walking away. Thirty minutes later those same guys start banging on the door again this time real forcefully which made us real nervous. So my roommate got her gun just in case and pointed it down (never at them), so when she opened the door (I don't know why) she told them "we are not interested". I know those two guys saw the gun because their aggressiveness turned into a look of passiveness. So they said  "Oh OK sorry to bother you miss, you have a nice night" and they just walked away. But now my roommate is nervous because she's afraid they might report her. She didn't point the gun at them, she just pointed it down close to the side of her leg. We were just nervous because they looked and acted aggressive especially when we told them we were not interested, but they go and come back again anyways but in a real aggressive manner. This is not a racial issue because they were both the same race as we were. I can just tell these two have been in prison before...I can't explain how I know..I just know.

Living in Texas, we have the castle doctrine, which allows us to shoot in self defense, anyone who is illegally in our homes, such as burglars. I've heard that the castle doctrine applies to anything considered your "domain", which could be your car, and place of business, I guess if you own it.         I know that possession of a gun by a minor is illegal, but say during a home invasion, one of the two parents gets shot, or isn't able to reach the location where the shotgun is hidden, and a 13/17 year old could easily get and use it to defend the house. Hypothetically, suppose they DO seize and fire the gun, injuring or killing the invader(s). Would either be charged criminally for their actions, or is it considered self defense still anyway? Would they be penalized for doing the same at the office? I know guns aren't supposed to be carried in a car, where they are readily accessible. But we have a 2-seater truck. Would we need to store it in the tool box in the bed, or what?

Why are not these businesses/banks/etc. allowed to fail as is part of the Capitalist way?  If bailing out Wachovia, why not bail out the pizza place down the road.  Do I "own" part of Wachovia now (can I get a loan at a reduced rate since my taxes are helping them out?...I do not think so).  We are on a slippery slope and need to get a grip soon, or we may be an experiment in Democracy that has seen its end.

I cannot pay my credit card bills at this time and I had my undergraduate student loans discharged so I cannot apply for a second discharge because i signed something saying I would not. I did not see that i was not better and the dr. who wrote I was ok to take on the debt caged it in saying"from a medical perspective" because he knew that i was so anxious and needed to avoid the psychological stress which is the reason my undergrad loans were discharched. I feel I need to have the one semester graduate loan discharged because i was not in a condition to take it out in the first place and did not realize it. I looked up bankruptcy basics and it says I can apply for a discharge under undue hardship but it says you need to make payments for 5 years. I am not planning to go to work so I will be receiving disability for those years and cannot pay I will have a deferment and then forbearance. I would rather take care of this now rather than putting it off until later. It is taking away my peace I am so anxious. What can I do Do I need to wait five years with deferments and forbearance to get a discharge-what should I do in the meanitime with the credit card debt I cannot pay due to needing to take care of myself ?

20090131195930AAPLlB8	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Obstructed view ticket, can I get out of this?	I was in a sheetz parking lot in Akron Ohio. I just filled up my tank. A police officer pulling into the lot saw me begin to pull away from the pumps with some dusting of snow on my window. I was turning around a pump as he was coming towards me. We both stopped. He did not move, I was forced to back up to get around him. As I did so, he rolled down his window and told me to "take 3 minutes and clear your window" assuming the snow is what caused us from obstructing us in the parking lot. I said I could see just fine, I thought I heard him say "or I could take you to jail" but according to him he said "or I could cite you". I brushed off the snow from my window and he rolled past. Then, my anger set in. Thinking that he had threatened to take me to jail for this, I put the car in reverse and pulled up to him. I rolled down my window and asked him for his badge number and a telephone number to call his superior. He told me the Police Department, I asked for the non emergency line # and he refused to give it to me. While dialing 411 he asked for my ID. One of his superiors pulled up while I was on the phone, he tried to tell me that anything I say to the sargent on the phone will just come right back to him. I ignored him and proceeded with my phone call. I explained the situation to the sargent on the phone, while they wrote me a ticket. I felt that I the p/o was threatening to jail me in order to intimidate me. I felt also that, since I requested his badge number, he retaliated by writing me a ticket. I never entered the a public street. They took pictures of my window. My question, is this a moving violation and can I get out of this? Any suggestions?

I'm still a minor, and that should be enough info.      My mother is very abusive, and she does it behind the scenes. The few times i have tried to report it to the officers, no one believes me, because she is very professional, and she has worked with most of the officers in the area.      and yes, i do know the difference between abuse and discipline. my mother will beat me until i dont get up, or until i dont want to get up.      the worst part is, its for almost no reason, or if i dont want to argue with her.      i tried to run away not too long ago, and i went to my grandparents instead. my mother called me in as a runaway, and when i talked with the officer, he told me to 'grow up'. my mother made me seem like a teenager that has everything that just doesnt want to listen to anyone.      i'm not. i never have problems with anyone but my mother and father. but my father is a different story. he doesnt even come around to cause problems anymore.      my mother knows the law way better than i do, and she knows people that would be more than willing to beat me senseless, arrest me, and send me to juvenile. and she has threatened to do that to me once.      i dont know where to go from here, or what to do. i've started living with my grandparents, and i've been here since i ran.       can anyone please give me some advice?      and btw, my grandparents dont want to speak out against my mother, for the same reasons why i have failed the few times i have tried to; she knows the law better than us, and we're afraid that if we take it too far, and lose, we fear what might happen.         i know, there are tons of grammar and punctuation mistakes, but i am trying to type this as fast as possible, so no one in the house will find out about this.      please, help.

20090131180635AAlV5aH	Politics & Government;Elections	Where is Obama for the people in Kentucky?	Still, some 547,000 homes and businesses were still in the dark — including about 172,000 in Louisville.      Deputies trekked door-to-door in many communities to let people know where shelters were, forced to spread the word the old-fashioned way because cell phone and Internet service was spotty. In some towns, volunteers checked to make sure their elderly and disabled neighbors were all right.      Many Kentucky hotels offering discounted "power outage rates" reported being fully booked with people escaping frosty neighborhoods. Those who hunkered down in their homes face long lines to buy generators, firewood, groceries — even bottled water because power outages crippled local pumping stations.      So if these state was primarily minority would the new president not be down there in heartbeat- getting these people taken care of?
