20090202193122AATNaGH	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does anyone know if Disney's Madeline Lost in Paris movie will be put on DVD or BluRay and when?	I have been over time I have been getting rid of my old VHS movies and replacing them ones that I really like with DVDs (and recently I got a BluRay player).  One of my old favorites is Disney's Madeline Lost in Paris Movie that came out on VHS in 1999.  It has not been released on DVD.  I know the way Disney is... After so long they bring the movies back out then they go back into the vault or whatever they usually say on the advertisements.  I was wondering if anyone would happen to know if there are plans to put MADELINE LOST IN PARIS (DISNEY) to come out on Disc and When?      Thanks for your time!      Stacie

20090202092919AAIVArm	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Buy or Sell: Each member of a group should be completely opposite hip-hop wise?	I think in order to make a hip-hop group complete, you should have fusions of all different types of rappers that perform different subgenres. I think you should have one raw rapper, one gangsta rapper, one lyrical rapper, one who is primarly a producer but still raps, one politically concious rapper, one old skool rapper and one with a killer flow.    I think Wu-Tang Clan come the closest to this, each individual member has their own method, style and technique and with all their contributions made up together their a sick group. GZA (lyrical), RZA (producer), Method Man (raw) etc    RHH2: What is the best produced Roots album? + Who agrees Common would of been sick in The Roots?

Yes I like stero-typical jokes and since I am black and mixed to boot I am allowed to make them can someone help me out here and before you say anything I know this is mean in a way – But funny is funny so and a Black girl (from the hood) all I could think of when I first read the story about Obama and trying to go through the window was maybe he thought he was still back in the hood so can someone help me with formulating a quick joke ( I wont think your racists or anything I promise – a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men)    Or Maybe Obama just forgot where he was and that He was just back in the old neighborhood again :D       Maybe he was having a dream and thought he was running from the Police       Maybe Barry forgot he was president and was just trying to find a way it.       or maybe somthing like Obama didn’t realize he was not a racists,    He didn’t realize there were other ways into a house besides a window       And on a serious note the Funny thing is windows don't have hinges. But then Obama didn't notice Jeremiah Wright's rants, or Blago's propensity to horse-trade, William Ayers' radical actions or the difference between 42 and 43 and it really doesn’t make much of a difference. So the fact he doesn’t know a window from a door shouldn’t be much of a shock.

Tossing a grenade at the bride and groom, he whooped triumphantly and dived out the window onto the highway below, narrowly missing the oncoming cars.            *this story could win the nobel prize for literature*

20090202195829AAmkCpH	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Did you hear the one about the gynecologist?	A gynecologist had become fed up with malpractice insurance and HMO paperwork and was burned out.  Hoping to try another career where skillful hands would be beneficial, he decided to become a mechanic. He went to the local technical college , signed up for classes, attended diligently, and learned all he could. When the time for the practical exam approached, the gynecologist prepared carefully for weeks and completed the exam with tremendous skill.         When the results came back, he was surprised to find that he had    obtained a score of 150%. Fearing an error, he called the instructor,    saying, "I don't want to appear ungrateful for such an outstanding    result, but I wonder if there is an error in the grade."       The instructor said, "During the exam, you took the engine apart    perfectly, which was worth 50% of the total mark.  "You put the engine back together again perfectly, which is also worth 50% of the mark."       After a pause, the instructor added, "I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I've never seen done in my entire life.

20090202142015AAlSPf0	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Tarot? (10 points). im new to this.?	well lately something came across in a conversation my friends and i were having and it revolved around tarot cards.   well this is my question:      what are they?      i mean my friend tried explaining it to me (she doesn't do them or know much about them and i dont think she believes in them aether) but the only things is picked up was that they are cards (obviously) and they are used to predict the future or something like that but yeah, i dont know anything about them and so please write down all u know about tarot cards and also please answer these questions and yes i will be picking best answer for the person that answered my question and did not copy and paste things off the internet (i want answers where people know what they are talking about)      so okay here are my questions:   1. how many are in a deck? is there a limit?   2. how do you read them?   3. do you need some special skills to read them?   4. do you need to call up any demons or anything creepy like that?   5. do you need any specific props in order to be able to read them?   6. do you need to be anything specific to participate and read them? (i mean like do you have to have any believes, experience, or be part of any religion)?   7. is it dangerous?   8. do they even work?   9. do you need to be involved in meditation to read them?   10. do you say anything? is there a way to place the cards? please help and make sure to mention any details i need to know because if i can learn to read them (if im not required to be anything i cant be) id like to give it a try.         thanks in advance!

20090202142949AAZnVBc	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	When is a band just too much for you?	Whether it be their sound, their lyrics, their image, their beliefs, etc.    Are there any bands that you enjoy, but sometimes they are just too much for you to handle?    For example, the band Marduk.  I love them. I think they are a very talented black metal band that I can listen to anytime Im feeling crazy and awesome.  But, They are so fast and their lyrics are so awful that sometimes I just can't stand to listen to them. It's like they get so caught up in being fast and blasphemous, that they lose sight of what they should be trying to do, making enjoyable music for the fans that keep thier careers alive.

20090202142749AAYhwf6	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	How Early Should I Arrive to a Flight of the Conchords Concert with a General Admission Ticket?	I've never been to a concert before, so I'm completely clueless. I would like to arrive super-early to make sure I can get within a few rows - ideally five, hopefully ten - of the stage. I originally set out to buy the more expensive tickets, but the Reserved Seating is available only for rows 25-60, while a General Admission ticket is for rows 1-25 or 61-Top. It's my understanding that with a General Admission ticket, it would be an "arrive first, rock closer" kind of thing. (Please, correct me if I'm wrong.)      How early then should I arrive to secure a spot in the front? Would this be a "camp out" kind of thing, or would I only need to be there a few hours in advance? How many hours in advance should I arrive?      Any information would be incredibly helpful. Thank you!

20090202152608AAM7UTM	Entertainment & Music;Music;Country	What's your favorite duet by a country artist and a non-country artist?	The duet must be on an album (studio version) and not just performed on an episode of CMT Crossroads.  For instance, Brad Paisley and John Mayer performing either of their songs live on Crossroads would NOT count.  Keep in mind, however, the song can be country, blues, rock, jazz, etc. as long as one of the artists is country and the other is not.         My answer:   "Let the Good Times Roll" by Brad Paisley with blues guitarist B.B. King.

20090202165817AAA7oiz	Entertainment & Music;Movies	For Those Who Have Seen "Gone Baby Gone"?	Is the film "Gone Baby Gone" exceptionally brutal or anything? I don't mind the language and I've already heard of the brief scene of a dead boy and something about a fat lady with a gun. I hear the film is great and realistic (which worries me). I love films that are smart and powerful--and if they are realistic that's a bonus. The hardest thing I have had to handle in a movie was probably "American History X." So I'm not sure if "Gone Baby Gone" has extreme violence. I can take some brutal stuff but I'd prefer not to. What I'm mainly looking for in a film is the fact that it stays with the audience, leaves them talking, and is relatively well-made. My favorite films consist of "Slumdog Millionaire," "Memento," and "The Insider."   Hope that's enough information...by the way I'm younger than you think (young teen) but I've handled a lot (ahem... Martin Scorsese).

20090202174905AAEOZ1Q	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Crazy Riddle - Good Luck :) ?	OK so there is this man and he walks into a pet shop and notices a sign.      Dogs - $10   Cats - $7   Fish - $1      He walks up to the front desk and hands the woman ten dollars.       "What type of pet would you like, sir?" the woman asks.      "I want a dog"      So the woman hands the man a dog and he leaves, petting his new puppy.      Now another man walks in and he puts ten dollars on the front desk, but this time, the woman already knew that the man wanted a dog.      How did she know?      P.S. No, she didn't know him, there wasn't a tattoo that said "i like  dogs" if you think about it, you'll get it.

Husband #2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.

Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.       Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.       Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.

THANKSSSSSS         I'm washing my hands of my filthy disease,   You know the one that breaks the knees,   It's called 'having a stable family'   Yeah I got to say I've learnt to hate that disease.      When I was young I always swung off trees,   I didn't care for what pain it may bring,   I was happy and cheerful I didn't have a care,   Until I relised my father wasn't there.      Through Spring I sat out on the front porch   Just waiting to see my father again.   I sat through the dark holding a torch   It burnt open the truth that I was alone.      20 years now I'm still alone.   My brother died almost two years ago.

20090202134918AA1CKmF	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Bassists! I need your help learning the Bass!?	Okay so I have had a bass now for around three years. I barely ever play it, but now I am taking up learning the bass guitar and drums, since my dad used to own a drum shop, and he knows how to play Bass, Drums, Violin, Clarinet, Cello, etc, and he is amazing at all of them! So I am finally taking drumming and bass very seriously. Well I find learning to drum a lot easier then bass at times haha. But I have a problem with bass. I have small hands, unforuntately. I can't seem to make me hands fast enough or stretch far enough to play songs that are fast. I listen to Hard Rock and Heavy Metal so I need fast hands. I know this is going to take time, and I shouldn't rush it. But for example: Master of Puppets, by Metallica. The riff is:    A ---------2---------3--------4---------3-...  E ---0-1------0-1-------0-1------0-1------...    I have to either move my fingers VERY Fast, or stretch my hands, but In have such tiny fingers!!! What can I do? I really want to learn! My dad says I should squeeze a tennis ball a lot to make my fingers strongers and thicker, but I don't know what to do? Please help, there's not many bassist's out there and I want to become one!

20090202194002AAyL2Xf	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Was I the only one who relished the scene where Gilbert Grape finally got around to disciplining Arnie Grape?	Arnie was infuriating,out of control,and monopolized everyone around him.He was like that because his family would not discipline him just because he had the i.q of a six year old.When I was six years old anytime I acted foolish or bad My parents would discipline me and I felt that they were the worst people in the world,but now as an adult I've realized how much it helped me and I'm thankful for it now?Arnie is out of control because his family would not discipline him,and I loved the part where Gilbert finally got around to doing that?I hated the scene where Gilbert let Arnie slap his face because that was teaching him not to respect authority figures and now hes going to be out of control again.Just because someone has the mind of a child doesn't mean you shouldn't discipline them.

20090202202654AA5zg9Y	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	What do you think of the show Jon and Kate + 8?	I watched the new episode tonight where they are moving into their new house and I was just wondering what other people thought of this family.  I've heard a lot of negative things about Kate lately with the whole Aunt Jodi thing and how people say she's "exploiting" her kids for money and such...but I'm going to be honest and say I enjoy the show and I think if I had that many kids I would be going CRAZY! lol...I mean, I have a 3 year old and 7 month old (both girls) and I'm a stay at home mom and I couldn't imagine being in her shoes.  I love my girls more than anything, but at times I can get really stressed out and people criticize her and I think overall she does a good job.  Yeah, she yells at Jon sometimes, but I ask my hubby for help all the time because if I don't ask, he won't just do it, lol.  Anyway, just wanted to see what other people thought of the show.  (Oh, and I don't know what happened with Aunt Jodi, but if Kate was rude towards her then I think Kate did lose someone that truly loved her kids and that would be a sad thing.)

20090202200556AAfYn8e	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the name of this movie?	This was a movie made years ago....probably around 2002-2005. It was about a man (a somewhat famous actor played him...I want to say Ethan Hawke but I don't think it was) who fell in love with this girl and all of a sudden she disappeared. They were supposed to meet by a fountain or something and this guy spent years trying to find her. It's like he was obsessed with finding her.      I know that the actress who played the girl was not famous. I am pretty sure this was her first film.       The weird part is I can't remember this movie being good or anything....I just can't stop thinking about what the name was. Hopefully I provided enough information to get some responses. Thank you in advance.

A gazillion adult sites out there claim to show videos and pics of "real" girls who have never done porn before. I wonder how many of those girls are what they claim to be? Would that many everyday college girls or young professional women - i.e., girls who aren't professional strippers or porn actresses - be inclined to star in a porn movie? I ask that since there is so much staged and truly fake action coming out of the industry that it's hard to know what to believe.

In my mind theres a woman singing, and shes like sort of being scary or chasing people, or maybe she herself isn't doing the chasing but people are being chased. I think the movie might be from the late 80s early 90s. I cant remember any of the lyrics, maybe it its something like "Don't ya..." but I could be wrong. I think it has maybe a latin beat. Sort of humming it goes like  Dun dun dun dun DUN dun. Bum bum bum bum BUM bum. The tempo is sorta like Dun (tiny pause) dun dun dun DUN (hold note a little bit)  dun. and so on. Please help me im going insane!

20090202203200AAsUzwO	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Thoughts on tonights episode of Gossip Girl?	What is your thoughts on tonight's episode and your future predictions?   I am a HUGE fan of Gossip Girl, I LOVE the books(read every one) and the show(seen every one). My celebrity crushes are Chace Crawford and Ed Westwick, Gossip Girl is on my desktop background, and my cell phone background ect. I own every book and season 1 on DVD and check news on it everyday. So as you can tell i'm a big fan, so no haters please.   CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!   Thoughts:   Where do I begin??? Blair almost expelled, Dan and Ms.Carr, Bart in some kind of cult!!! This was another one of those saturated with drama episodes. I'm so glad Blair is Ok and everything is back to normal for her, even though she can be pure evil, she is one of my favourite characters. Nelly Yuki is going to be so sorry when she goes to school and sees Blair, hasn't she learned anything??? It's Blair Waldorf for God sakes!!! After seeing the preview for Carnal Knowledge when it came out, I was so mad at Dan for days because I thought he was cheating on Serena, but it turned out to be a rumor, I was glad. Then when everthing was fine even though he and Serena broke up AGAIN, he had sex with Ms.Carr!!!!!!!!! I was SO mad, because we all know he will get back with Serena eventually and it's going to bite him in the as*. Ms.Carr is allowed to take her job back, but she better not after what happend with Dan. I have hated Ms.Carr since she first appeared on the show, she can go jump off a cliff. I never really got the whole Chuck thing about this episode... I know that he was accidently invited to a party for a cult that his dad is in, but I don't understand what kind of cult it is supposed to be, and I didn't think it mattered that much in this episode. It probally will later. Is anyone else hating this lack of contact will Blair and Chuck???      What i'm wondering:   Will Nate and Vanessa EVER break up???   Will Chuck and Blair finally get together???   How hard will sleeping with Ms.Carr bite Dan is the as*???   Will he get back with Serena???   How important will Chuck new revealed secret be???   and a few more that I can't think of at the moment         Predictions:   Dan and Serena will get back together.   Chuck and Blair will get back to their game of cat and Mouse.   Nate will find someone new(again).   Georgina is soon to return.......       What is your Thoughts, Questions and Predictions???

My group decided to go outside of the box and chose the Big Purple dinosaur as our leader and how he influences children throughout the world. I am wondering if you can give me some insight as to how Barney is a leader and how he has affected children throughout the world. If you can stick to constructive comments that would be great as I know this topic will get many negative responses and people making jokes. Anything you can think of on how Barney has affected children throughout the world that would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

20090202141437AAzN3Gv	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll : Your most hated fictional character?	Everyone from Twilightt except from Jasper, take that Twihards!      I hugged Edward as he bent over to kiss me. We held hands as I looked at his Adonis-like features. I begun to bite my nails and then it happened. Snap! I broke a nail. Edward's head jerked around and he cradled me in his arms.      "Oh, Bella! Whatever will we do? Don't die. Oh, woe is me. I love you, Bella! I'm trouble, Bella. I don't deserve you. You should leave me now, Bella," he said, still holding my hand.       I looked at his perfect features. His perfect face and his overall perfection.       "We'll get through this, because I love you Edward!"       "You know I will give you anything and everything", he said. We continued walking and he let go of my hand for 5 seconds. I tumbled down a hill and fell into a random dark ditch.       "Oh, Edward ... save me because I am incompetent without you and Stephenie Meyer loves to portray me as the damsel in distress which promotes sexism. Oh, Edward I'm such a Mary Sue, but you still love me, don't you?"

20090202143110AAHyLm2	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think airports should do to keep geese away from airports?	I was just asking because I live in Brooklyn, NY and when I heard the news about the plane last month, I was shocked, but happy people weren't hurt. Well, I just wanted to see you're opinion about what happened and what you think airports should do to keep geese away from them. Thus, reducing the chance of a plane accident similar to the one that happened last month. I think airports should:      - Keep geese in zoos rather than airports. There are A LOT of them in the Bronx Zoo. They should keep some in there, in Central Park, and the Prospect Park Zoo. If possible, keep some in Prospect Park as well.       What do you think?

I also know it sung by a woman and it sounds sort of country-ish!   Thanks to anyone who thinks they might know from this vague description!
