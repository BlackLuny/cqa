20090307174546AAW9fLV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	HARSH CRITICISM AND OPINIONS WANTED!!!?	(book title tentative maybe Skye Larkin and the key to REM)      Prologue      A Bad Beginning         The girl ran but she was tired. She had come such a long way already, at a pace that suggested her life depended on it, which it very well did. The Torments were fast approaching. Torments were ugly, malicious little creatures, and once set loose would not stop until they had caught their prey. Reluctantly she leaned up against a solid oak to catch her breath. The sound of nearby twigs snapping urged her forward, so she brushed the sweaty curls from her brow and continued to run, her curls streaming in the wind. The Torments were gaining. All they could think of was the girl and they stared after her with their beady yellow eyes and gnashed their teeth. Sweat poured down the small of her back, and her side ached constantly but still she ran. She had to. She had stolen the First Book and there was no turning back now. The book clutched to her chest didn’t look like anything special. It was bound in age mottled leather and was rather worn but she held it like something precious. Ahead of her loomed the Hairy Forest, the most dangerous place in REM, but the girl ran in without a second thought. She had to get away from the Torments. She had to find a safe haven for the book. In her haste she never noticed the glowing. She just ran right through the yellow, blue and green swirling vortex of light that had suddenly opened ahead of her. Perhaps if she had seen it she would have not gone through it, and maybe gone around but we shall never know. The sudden chill made her heart skip a beat, and she realized the torments were no longer with her. Everly was falling and it seemed like a very long way down.

20090307183142AAFA934	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help me with a name for my book..?	Hi. I am writing a book and I don't know what to call it! It is about a girl named Sapphire, and she and her family - which consitces of her big bro' Topaz, and her mom Chloe- move to a small town called Ashbrooke falls. Sapphire has a hard time fitting in, until she meets a girl named Ruby. Ruby and her friends accept Sapphire for who she is, and stick up for her. The badass clique of the school consitces of Stacy, Claire, and Natasha. They don't like Sapphire and her friends, so they torment them in every way possible. Sapphire then begins to notice some of the things that are going on. Like, when they start a "food war" with the badass clique, no one actually throughs food in the begining, and stuff like that. She finally relizes WHY her friends are known as "nobodys or outcasts." They all have supernatural powers. Please help me find a name. Bye!
20090307191828AAXTAJl	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	If you like fantasy aimed at kids such as harry potter please read this?	i really need opinions. is my writing any good??? would you read more. thanks. its aimed at middle schoolers.               It was hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, but too hot for anybody to stay and watch. Everyone stayed in the cool comfort of their homes. Listless branches hung to the ground too tired to dance with the wind. Even the wind was exhausted, too worn out to even cool the heat, it just pushed the hot air around. It was the kind of day in which one should sit directly in front of a fan, or better yet an air conditioner, with a book and some ice cold lemonade. Definitely not a day for strenuous activity. Most definitely not a day for running, unless of course you wished to pass out from heat exertion.      The girl ran but she was tired and hot. Sweat matted her curls down and the effort had made her round cheeks red and her breath come out in rasping gasps. She had come such a long way already, at a pace that suggested her life depended on it, which it very well did. The Torments were fast approaching.      Torments were ugly, malicious little creatures, and once set loose would not stop until they had caught their prey. They were only about twenty inches high but fierce, they had but to touch you to cause tremendous mental amguish, they needed no rope to keep you bound.      Reluctantly, she stopped and leaned up against a solid oak to catch her breath. The sound of nearby twigs snapping urged her forward, so she brushed the sweaty curls from her brow and continued to run, her curls streaming in the wind. The Torments were gaining. All they could think of was the girl and they stared after her with their beady yellow eyes and gnashed their teeth.      Sweat poured down the small of her back, and her side ached constantly but still she ran. She had to. She had stolen the First Book and there was no turning back now.

Everly just ran right through the yellow, blue and green swirling vortex of light that had suddenly opened ahead of her. Perhaps if she had seen it she would have not gone through it, and maybe gone around it to some other adventure, but that would make this a very different story.      The sudden quiet chill made her realize she was suddenly alone. Nausea rumbled in her belly as the tumbling sensation hit. Everly was falling and it seemed like a very long way down.

If the tiles were noticed to be faulty, could the crew have waited to be rescued ?      The media seemed to be desperately trying to bring it to everyone's attention that there might be a problem.

Io studio filosofia all'università per il piacere di studiarla e mi sconcerta il fatto che proprio la sezione dedita alla filosofia sia violentata così: risate senza senso, frasi razziste completamente sgrammaticate domande ripetute fino alla nausea ecc. Va bene scherzare ma questa sezione è proprio infestata da volgarità e da idiozie varie. Perché proprio la filosofia? Io sono il primo a porre domande a volte provocanti o semplicemente ironiche però alcune di quelle presenti nella sezione filosofia sono veramente offensive e denigratorie nei confronti della filosofia stessa. Purtroppo anche yahoo answers, come i vari forum di yahoo, con il tempo, da posto destinato allo scambio reciproco di informazioni è divenuto un posto in cui reciprocamente si scambiano solo insulti ed offese. Perché qualsiasi forma di dibattito libero, aperto a tutti come questo, scade sempre nella volgarità e nella prevaricazione sugli altri?

20090307232930AAXAXZ0	Arts & Humanities;History	Prior the fall of the Roman Empire were there warning signs?	It is my understanding that prior to and in the process of decline, the government of Rome was going through some changes. Many of it's newer citizens were taking up residence from around it's territories in Africa and the Middle East and settling close to the capitol. These citizens and their descendants eventually became educated and worked their way into government and into positions of power. The faces of Roman Governance eventually looked quite different. Many went so far as to import fair haired wigs from the north and also took took bleaching their skin.      It would only seem fair that the oppressed would eventually seize power from their oppressors. So when the new kids on the block started to run the show was that one of the major indicators that things were going to change?

20090307225701AAu11cN	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What can be my argument?	Im 17, and my girlfriend is 17, both juniors in highschool.   We were foolin around and we had never done anything besides makeout but we really wanted to do other stuff since we had been together for 6 months. So as i was fingering her/eating her out my mom walks in on us after coming home from dinner at my mimi's 1 mile away. She texted me that she yelled, but we didn't hear because of the moaning. We have been going out for 6+ months, and like 3 months building up to it. My mom would never think of me to do this kind of thing ever. What can be my arguement when my mom talks to me? What justifies my actions? What should i say?

20090307233605AAuYGwr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How is this writing-opinions appreciated?	The theater was dark, the air warm with the breath of anxious movie goers. A boy was to my left; Joey Ackart sat with his faced turned forward, eyes glued to the screen. With the sound of music that is designed to make your heart jump faster, I felt the body heat elevate off of his hand to mine. I could tell that they were only a few inches away from each other and with every beat of the nerve-wracking music, I felt even more tense in my seat. Suddenly and without warning, I felt his warm hand in mine as the music turned into a skin crawling sound that despite the horrific images on the screen, made the corners of my mouth turn up in approval by the feelings that began to rush through me.   His grip got tighter as did mine and the movie continued on. We both paid attention to what was happening (or, at least he might have but I sure as hell couldn't) until the plot calmed down for a moment of less gore and more tension when he let go. My heart sank at his release and I paid attention again to the movie. I had the feeling that something bad was going to happen to our heroin and curled my body on the seat and leaned on him. He chuckled at my reaction and while keeping his eyes forward, offered his hand again which I took in my own and as a woman was suddenly killed by her daughter in the second dimension when I nearly jumped out of my seat, accidentally kicking the woman sitting in front of me. Joey nearly fell out of his seat laughing at me. The movie continued with the both of us in the same spot without movement, not even a twitch of the hand besides tightening when the scenes got scary...

20090307235132AAn8dKk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	INSPIRING WRITER: criticism please =)?	I'd really appreciate any comments.. I have to write a short story for school, and the topic is 'unhappiness'.   I've based it on my experience on school exchange, which I spent in Italy during the Christmas break.   Constructive criticism is greatly needed! Thankyou =)         You know when you think something’s going to be really awful, but when it happens, it’s actually not that bad? Yeah, that’s what I hoped this would be like. Turns out, it’s not. In fact, it’s the complete opposite. It’s a nightmare.      When I first decided to come to Italy, I wanted an experience to remember. Not just an experience, but one of a lifetime. I wanted to learn the language, to cook risotto, to fit in with the new host family. I wanted to be a part of it. The Italian life. But It’s hard when all they do is push you away. Every day, I tried. I tried so hard, but it was never enough. Now all I want is to go to sleep and never wake up. I want to run, but there’s nowhere to run to.      I remember that first day I walked into her room. The gothic drawings of suicidal women plastered on the walls. The black windows. The dirty red carpet. The silence that echoed through the empty house, through my head. That night I cried myself to sleep. How could I have chosen this for myself? I thought of my friends, my family, all of them back in Australia. All there together, enjoying the summertime. I sat on the bed, tears streaming down my face, as I stared out the window, alone. I couldn’t see anything, but I could feel the cold. Winter. I thought of them again, there without me.      Days went by that I can’t recall anything from. But maybe I just don’t want to remember. All I know is, I didn’t go out, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t eat.  Nothing else mattered. I just wanted to go home.       Her name was Chiara. Why, I don’t know. In Italian, Chiara means ‘clear’, ‘light’, or ‘luminous’. I couldn’t think of anything worse to describe this monster whose sole purpose of existence was to make my life a living hell. She was anything but- She was as dark as they come; as dark as the night sky on that first lonely night. I remember looking at old photographs, and came across one of her as a child. Unrecognisable. She had the palest, most beautiful blonde ringlets that I had ever seen in my life. But she dyes it now. A frizzy shock of blood red that makes my stomach churn every time I see it.      After 13 days, 17 phone calls, and 4 and a half kilograms lighter, I have to get out. Nothing in the world is going to stop me, I can’t stay here any longer. It’s like I can see everything unravelling before me like a horrific bedtime story, except I can’t see any happy ending revealing itself at the end. I can see it all happening right here, but can’t do anything to make it better, or to go away. It’s real, and I can’t do a single thing to stop it. Before all this, I thought I would never want to go home. Now I just I have to get out.      This is supposed to be an exchange of two different cultures, one learning about the other, a beautiful thing. Chiara and I are like day and night. Light and dark. Life and death. Complete opposites, bound together by one common, yet at the same dreadful, thing which I can’t do anything about. All I want is to be happy, but it seems that all she wants is make everybody else as miserable and alone as she is.        I never realised what being unhappy really meant before this. Is it a dream? A nightmare? Or reality in its purest form? It’s one of those things that you rarely hear about. You think: it’ll never be me, but then it happens. You’re it. And there’s nothing you can do to stop it.

20090307235630AAJCrcJ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you please read my poem?	hi, i would like you to tell me what you think of the poem:       Apocalypse       The sun was beaming, the  earth revolved around it,   The flowers swayed in the cool spring breeze,   The sky was like a portrait, painted by the Gods,   The sea was a flawless dark blue that sparkled like diamonds.      All was well as a couple viewed the world,    The high-rise buildings that dominated the sky,   The green trees that brought life to the world,    The birds glided like planes that soared high.       The sun retreated in a hurry, the earth stood still,   The flowers were no longer swaying,    The earth’s duties, it could no longer fill.    The sea turned rough, our world is decaying.       The couple stood their ground and waited for the worst,   As the rain, wind and thunder attempted to break them down.   The earth trembled beneath their feet,    But the couple still stood strong – waiting for their time to come.      A great big ball of fire plummeted from the heavens,   As the final role call came, the Apocalypse.   For a moment, all was silent, all went dark,   As the lovers grasped each others hands,    Waiting to go to the promise land.

20090307230224AAvdoGC	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Which Monologue would be better?	Let me tell you something about Janis Ian. We were best friends in middle school. (makes a face) I know right, it's soooo embarrassing. I don’t even…whatever. So then in eighth grade I started going out with my first boyfriend Kyle, who was totally gorgeous but then he moved to Indiana--and Janis was like, weirdly jealous of him. Like if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like "Why didn't you call me back?!" and I'd be like, "Uh, why are you so obsessed with me?" So then for my birthday party, which was an all girls pool party, I was like, "Janyce I can't invite you because I think you're a lesbian" I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party! There were going to be girls there in their bathing suits! I mean right, she was a lesbian! So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her and it was so retarded and then she dropped out of school 'cause no one would talk to her and she came back in the fall for high school and her hair was all cut off and she was totally weird and now I guess she's on crack. (gasps and turns) Oh my God! I love your skirt, where did you get it?   Lea: It was my mom's in the '80s.   Regina: Vintage, so adorable.   Lea: Thanks. (Lea walks away.)   Regina: That is the ugliest effing skirt I've ever seen.         The on e from 10 things I hate about you....   I hate the way you talk to me. And the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare I hate your big dumb combat boots. And the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick-- it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh -- even worse when you make me cry. I hate it that you're not around. And the fact that you didnt call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you - - not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.      Okay so I'm trying out for Rizzo for Grease with monologe would be better the one from mean girls or 10 things I hate about you????         Thanks

I come from haunts of coot and hern      I make a sudden sally,    And sparkle out among the fern,      To bicker down a valley.        By thirty hills I hurry down,      Or slip between the ridges,    By twenty thorps, a little town,      And half a hundred bridges.        Till last by Philip’s farm I flow      To join the brimming river,    For men may come and men may go,      But I go on for ever.        I chatter over stony ways,      In little sharps and trebles,    I bubble into eddying bays,      I babble on the pebbles.        With many a curve my banks I fret      By many a field and fallow,    And many a fairy foreland set      With willow-weed and mallow.        I chatter, chatter, as I flow      To join the brimming river,    For men may come and men may go,      But I go on for ever.        I wind about, and in and out,      With here a blossom sailing,    And here and there a lusty trout,      And here and there a grayling,        And here and there a foamy flake      Upon me, as I travel    With many a silvery waterbreak      Above the golden gravel,        And draw them all along, and flow      To join the brimming river,    For men may come and men may go,      But I go on for ever.        I steal by lawns and grassy plots,      I slide by hazel covers ;    I move the sweet forget-me-nots      That grow for happy lovers.        I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,      Among my skimming swallows ;    I make the netted sunbeam dance      Against my sandy shallows.        I murmur under moon and stars      In brambly wildernesses ;    I linger by my shingly bars ;      I loiter round my cresses ;        And out again I curve and flow      To join the brimming river,    For men may come and men may go,      But I go on for ever.       the questiuon is.......at some places the poet mentions that the brook 'slips','steals' or 'slides'.what does he mean??      thanks a lot!!!   =)

20090227121951AA8IlRn	Arts & Humanities;History	Where would I, Average Joe, go to use a phone in 1905 America?	I read that there were already 3 million phones in America in 1904. Who had them? How wide-spread were they? If I lived in a small town (not a large city, but not a 50-person farming town, either) where would I go to use a phone? Would many people have them in their homes? Businesses? Were public use phones available or was there a central service, like Western Union, that could receive and send phone calls for you?      I'm writing a piece set in the period and any help you could provide would be much appreciated. I've done my own research around the web and on sites like Wikipedia (where I found the 3 million number), but most places provide only how many phones there were, not how they were used or who had them. That's the angle I'm not finding.      Thanks in advance for any help you can give me!   (Cross-posted in Consumer Electronics -> Land Phones)
