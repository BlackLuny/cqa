I have an Opitarc DVD RW AD-7530B ATA Device, which is failing to read CD's, and obviously burn them.      Have uninstalled the device, and looked for drivers online, which have only come back as "Failed".   Getting really annoyed with the bloody think now. Any Tech advice would be greatfully received.       Thank you.

20090220112534AAP8pWF	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	I'm very computer friendly but I'm stumped.  Windows XP system settings problem, re: desktop/homepage.  Help?	My little one has done something I've never seen before to cause whatever the homepage is to display on the desktop.  It layers over whatever other wallpaper I've chosen.  If I enter a new homepage, that becomes the new display.  I have never seen this before and I don't know how to undo it.      What I've tried:      a)  using the control panel display function and changing the wallpaper.      b)  looking in add/remove programs to see if something is operating as a program.      c)  running Ccleaner      d)  doing a system restore.      Obviously, the child has changed a system setting that causes this to happen, but I have no idea what it is.      Anyone who can quickly and reliably tell me what to do with this will not only get best answer from me here, I will go to your other open questions and vote for you for best answer someplace else.      Thanks.

I play Scrabble on Lexulous and since then whilst playing I lose the stadard colours on their site - reverts to black and white and fuzz - and then crashes.  The obvious answer would be to do a Syste Restore but on this flipping Vista it's not as straight forward and I can't do it as it seems to set it's own restore points.  They (Lexulous)  suggest I contact Wibdows which I ds and they suggest I do a System Recovery!?   O.K does anyone know why I can't do a System Restore  and why I have to do a System Recovery. I've saved most of the importantr files but it's such a flipping nuisance.   If I need to Restore in future if this happens every time I feel like reverting back to XL ????

I just find that trying to do any real work on them, like spread sheets, charts, and power point its just a little quirky. But at home I don't need to do any of that stuff. Mostly just listening to music, surfing the web, downloading pictures and stuff. So I am thinking maybe a Mac will better suit my "fun" needs.      I'm not sure what to buy, anybody got any suggestions. I was looking into the iMac, or a PC from Dell or Sony.

To pc users, why should I stick w/ my pc?         p.s. i currently own a laptop, and would want to stick with a laptop if i got a mac. Any good models out there?

This should be an instance variable -- it should not be local to any method.       Add an init method (public void init()). Remember that init is called only once, when the applet is loaded, which is what you want -- this way you only create one set of circles.       In init, write a loop that fills the array with Circle objects. Each time through the loop you will need to create a new circle and store it in the next slot in the array.       Modify paint to run through the array and draw each circle. No new circles should be created in paint!! "
20090220122934AAxQ7mP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	My DVD drive isn't reading anything anymore. I checked the Device Manager but it's saying everything is OK.?	I have the following problem: I just bought a new PC 4 months ago. It really looked like a good deal till it started to have some problems with the front 120 mm fan 2 months ago. After 3-4 hours working on the computer I started to hear a strange noise comming from the fan. It happened daily till it stoped a few days ago. I tought the problem was gone. Now I'm having problems with my CD/DVD drive which is an Samsung TSSTCorp CDDVDW SH-S223F ATA device. The problem is that after playing a few times Rainbow Six Vegas ( the DVD has a big scratch on it that i ingnored) the player stopped reading the DVD. My first taught was that the problem was relied to that scratch and decided to change DVD. I've chosen to use GTA 4 (it doesn't have any scratches on it) and I saw that the DVD reader didn't read it. Then I took a music CD and played it. The problem was that the CD/DVD drive took a lot of time to load the CD and even when it was done the music wasn't clear at all. I could only hear strange noises.    Can somebody tell me why is this happening and how to repair it cuz' i don't wanna buy a new DVD/CD player and have the same thing?? Do you think I should use a Lens Cleaner or it's a different problem??       Thanks,       dalex2093

Hi   I'm trying to create a function formula as an if condition to total column N below as follows:      If column K (Alloc No) is blank - it will return column N (Amount)   If column K is not blank, but contains a number, return column N      if column K contains only one unique number in the column, it should return the same row in column N     if column K contains the number more than once, it would total column N for all the same numbers in column K.      I've tried an IF and Lookup formula, but I'm not sure how to include in the formula how to search for duplicate numbers in column K.  Below is a sample of what I have used.

Ppl either have both a MySpace and a Facebook or just a MySpace.  So I'm thinking as I graduate this year is whether I really should consider creating that MySpace now or just stick to only the Facebook.  10 points for... etc.       Also feel free to advise or add your own opinion on what I should do and why - it'd be greatly appreciated.

20090220130557AAUQAVW	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	I Need A new AMD Motherboard?	I'm looking for a new motherboard for my Mid Tower Gaming Desktop. I have an AMD Athlon FX-60 (939pin). I see motherboards on newegg that support the athlon 64 FX but I'm not quite sure what the different sockets and pins mean.      I'm hoping to get a new AMD motherboard that will support my FX 60 and possibly a phenom 2(or future cpu) down the road when I decide to get a new cpu.      I'm not an overclocker and I only need enough slots for a my 9800GT and a sound card. I only have a 500W PSU as well.      any suggestions?

20090203034115AAq2nxM	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is this laptop worth fixing?	I have a Compaq C710TU laptop. Recently I have experienced issues with my battery, ac adapter and touch-pad. My battery has been depleted and can only hold a 15min charge. The ac adapter ceases to charge the battery properly as the power cord is damaged. The touch-pad has since become non-responsive also. I have called HP and they have quoted me a price of $280 for the cost of the battery and the ac adapter however the touch-pad will need to be sent in and since my laptop is now out of warranty I'll have to pay additional fees. This laptop was purchased for $500. Is it really worth throwing money at it or is it time I purchase something with a little more processing power? I have become aware of a Toshiba laptop (Satellite Pro L300 - PSLB9A-01G002) which seems to be more capable of aiding me with my daily studies for $800. Has anyone had any experience with this laptop model or can send me a link to a better laptop of similar price? I live in Australia and would like something capable of word-processing, low end-gaming and internet browsing.

20090220112455AAuD4Iy	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Am I tricked (riped off) by lenovo?	So I bought this lenovo thinkpad ****, x200, super mobility yeah right, it's small its tiny but its function is not as advertized.      First off, it doesn't have the webcam it promised to have. All the tech specs on lenovo's website says x200 has a webcam well i DO NOT have one.      2nd off, the modem was gone! it's so insulting that they still leave the modem sign on the machine, but the modem socket is blocked ! by a chunk of plastic! what the hell is that?!      2 hardwares down already, now the most outrageous part, what kind of idiot will include the super high end CPU (intel p8400@ 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo centrino 2!) in a laptop while ONLY SUPPORTING IT WITH 1 GB of ram???? (hello? wer talking about running a windows vista here). Now the little ram draged down the processor's performance, you feel like having a 128MB ram on a xp machine with single core low end processor! multi-tasking??? what a joke!      NOW the battery, ohhh don't even get me start on that one, the website says it will supply this "high end product" with "exclusively designed, super extended long time performance battery", and promised it will at least support AT LEAST 5-6 hours of running time. But what i got is actually a 4-CELL battery, yep, you heard it 4-CELL, OH MY ****** GOD, at today's world, 6-cell is the base line! but I got a FOUR-CELL battery for "higher performance"!!!! THIS IS MORE THAN INSULTING! now after fully charged, I only get up to 90mins of battery time.       FINALLY, this unit doesn't have a optical drive, but then I thought I could always buy an external dvd recorder or bluray recorder from them, since thinkpad (once under IBM) always provide an option like that if optical drive is not included in the machine due to mobility design. BUT I WAS WRONG, CRAPPY LENOVO DOESN'T EVEN HAVE OPTICAL DRIVE FOR SALE!      Don't even touch anything lenovo, you'll get ripped off.

I also have two asp:button that will redirect the user to a new page (not associated with the dropdownlists).  The only problem is, is that when I have both dropdownlists bound with a datareader, the buttons will not respond to a click â they are clicked but nothing happens.  I checked and they onClick events are all correct.  What has me confused is that when I comment out one dropdownlist binding, but leave the other, the buttons work.

20090220142120AA9IlU7	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Web hosting and domain registering?	I would like to start up designing more websites for people.  I am unsure on the web hosting and domain registering side of things.  If for example I have 10 companies that need websites and I am designing them one for them each.  Am I to register a different account name etc for the web hosting so that they keep up the payments etc after it is built or do I put it under my registered account name? This may sound a thick question but I am unsure.        If I am to keep them all under my account name then do I keep all of the website coding I have built until they have asked for it or still give it to them anyway?      Many thanks

I can't use limewire, nor can I use itunes or any other paying song download place (unless I buy the gift cards for myself - can you actually do that? Pay for the gift cards if you can't use credit card?). How do you download songs from youtube without getting a virus? And, if you download a song from youtube, if the file had a virus, and you downloaded it from youtube, would you get the virus too?      Bonus question: My brother explained to me, if you're going to download limewire, then you have to watch out for the music files, because that is what has the virus. He also explained that if the files are a certain size, that that file has a virus. Does anyone know what the size is? (He said that it was around 7 or higher...or something...)

Sorry for the title, but it was alittle hard to know what to put..       my question.      i have a website ive created for someone.      it has different pages.. a guestbook page (php), and a blog page (also uses php)..      now, they have asked if its possible, to have a 'private' page, where, for example, someone emails them, and instead of receiving it at their pc end (outlook express or other mail program), the 'website' private page receives it.. and also, this same 'page' can also send emails.       is this possible ? is there any free written php out there that can do this? is it actually possible to recieve your normal pop3 emails to somewhere on your website/host, instead of through your mail software?       there may well be simpler answers to this, such as, just get a message board and send private messages, or somethin like that.. but i wanted to see if the original main question i was asked, was actually possible..      thanks in advance php knowledgeable people.. :)

I just moved and now I am trying to reconnect my router to my laptop. When the ethernet cable is connected directly from the cable modem to my laptop I can get online, but when I try to do the setup through the router, Linksys say's it cannot detect a connection. I tried cloning the MAC address, calling comcast, pretty much everything.       Does it make a difference that I have Vista and am trying to set it up on a laptop?      Please Please help!!
