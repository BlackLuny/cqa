20090306222451AA2nueW	Health;Women's Health	I have this fear that I don't have the strength to get through this pregnancy...?	So it's been a rough pregnancy. First I had severe Hyperemesis Gravidarum (extreme morning sickness) that has put me off work, and really strained things between my husband and I. It's hard on him because he has to do everything, including taking care of our 19 month old son. He doesn't complain, and he tries hard, but I can tell he resents me. He doesn't get to go out much or do fun things, and works like a dog, non-stop.       But about 18 weeks the HG started to clear up a little...just iin time for me to have a fall and tare 5 ligaments in my ankle...again sidelining me for a few weeks.       Then this week, just as my ankle got better, I got the stomach flu, which was compounded by the HG because I couldn't keep my medications down.       I still feel horrible, but as I was puking and being hooked to an IV, all I could think was that I didn't think I could get through this pregnancy. I mean, I still have just under halfway to go...and I am beat down.       I just don't think I have the strength to get through a labour, and the post labour healing. Not to mention how worried I am about the toll it's taking on our relationship. I am supposed to be a partner, not a parasite...      Has anyone ever questioned their ability to get through pregnancy?  Any tips on how I can get through this??            **just to clarify, this baby is SO wanted. We both feel it will complete our family. We were on fertility treatments to get pregnant, so neither of us are sad about the pregnancy. We both want this child A LOT.

20090306225056AAG2BsH	Health;Optical	Need advice on what kind of lenses to get - lined bifocals or progressives (and if so, which type).?	I have worn the Nikon progressive lenses in a small squarish frame for about 3 years now.  I have HATED it every minute.  I usually yank the glasses off my face when I'm talking to people because they go in and out of focus, etc.  I can generally see fairly well around except for the small things up close.  I have an astigmatism and don't have a particularly strong prescription.  I have asked my eye doctor and several people at the optical store, but no one will venture an opinion other than to try a slightly larger frame/lens.  While I think I got used to my glasses as well as possible, it has been constant head adjustment with the slightest motion making what I'm looking at go out of focus.  The eye doctor suggested that perhaps lined bifocals would make me happier, but then changed his mind and said I should probably go with the stronger prescription in the progressive.  I was hoping that someone here might have some insight for me.  I got on a forum for people in the business and discovered just how many types of progressive lenses are out there.  Does anyone know if there is one that would suit my situation better?  Should I try the lined bifocals in my old glasses (not an expensive proposition at all) first and see how I like them and then try the progressive in a slightly larger lens, but then the question comes up as to which lens to look at, Varilux (and all their varieties), Nikon, the basic polycarbonate progressives, Zeiss, etc.  I am a professional musician that likes to do some outdoor sports and really needs the non-glare feature.  Anybody got any ideas before I start uninformedly trying different options?

My doctor tells me I need a sleep study to see what my problem is! I dont think that is necessary at all! I actually know when I will wake up if i go to sleep at a certain time, for example if i go to sleep at 10pm then ill wake up around 10am the next day! I write down times when I go to sleep and wake up and yet they still insist on a study, so i get to sleep in a hospital bed with stuff wired on me!      Is it really needed?      If i dont sleep at all, the only things that are bad is i get the chills and a tiny bit of numbness in my arms and legs meaning I am a bit tired, thats all.

The optometrist said it was an allergy, like hayfever and its something ill grow out of (im 15). im on steroid drops and they help short term but dont even make a dent in the problem in the long run. The twist is it get way worse whenever i look at a screne for a length of time. Like a computer or television. Whenever i use my computer for a resonable length of time they go very red and sting a lot. This never happens normally, without screnes i just get a bit red. Its been happening for about 6 months and its really annoying, especially because people often comment on it, even when i havent been looking at a screne. Are my allergies and the screen viewing related? Or could the screen thing be needing glasses (one point of view someone gave me)?

I'm tired. Period came in a funny spot last month, lasted about a day and a half, was very heavy. Cramping was normal. There were no problems with my birth control of choice (condoms) that I or my boyfriend are aware of, and we are very careful to check. Ovulation happened in left ovary about six days ago. I waited for my period, and when I suspected it might be late by a day, I took a test. Negative. That night, the condom got lost. I immediately took Plan B at the appropriate hours.    I'm trying to judge how effective the Plan B will be, and to do that, I have to figure out if there is a chance my period was delayed because I'm stressed and don't sleep right or because I was pregnant but still tested negative.      Gideon's knot; good luck.      P.S. Now researching other forms of birth control; visit my other questions please. :)

Every day I "shower" by simply standing in the hot water for 10 minutes and note using soap except for shampoo.      For the past year I haven't done much physical exercise, so I haven't gotten incredibly dirty or sweaty by any means but my immune system should also be deteriorating. I have also adopted horrible sleeping habits (going weeks at a time on only 2 hrs of sleep per night). Simultaneously this is the only year that I haven't gotten sick (in contrast several of the people I come in close contact with including family have concocted the worst cases of the flu this year)      I know that as as they encounter tougher obstacles bacteria evolves into strains that are more difficult to kill, and that's why scientists must keep developing new medicines to treat the same diseases. Do you think this could be the reason for my good health?

I just can't ignore it and keep walking without scratching. What could this be/ I know it isn't dry skin because I put on lotion before I go. It's probably not an allergic reaction either because I'm not allergic to much. So my question is what is causing this and how can I stop it?

20090307033337AA72iUq	Health;Dental	I had my wisdom teeth out yesterday and my bottom right lip is still numb from the Novocain?	Not really numb, but more of tingling. It was done at about 1:30 yesterday and now it's 630am. So, is this normal--even a little? My dentist said that there's a small chance that I could loose sensation--temporarily or permanently in my lip/chin because there's an important nerve that runs along where he needed to inject the Novocain.      At least I still have the other side of my lip ;).      But, will it be normal again?! It's kind of weird--if not, is there any treatment available?      I really don't want to sue the man, he's a good guy--so don't tell me to do that.

20090307031828AAqXPuL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	What are the chances of getting HIV while wearing a condom?	I had a questionable encounter, but I used a condom, but I'm not sure if it was rolled down all the way (more than half, but still)  to the base and I've been a little worried.  But then again, that's what condoms are made for, right?  Wouldn't it roll back during intercourse?  I was worried about her vagina going over the bottom roll.  I did fill the condom with water in the sink afterwards and there weren't any leaks/punctures.      A friend of mine did tell me that since the virus is transmitted through mucous membranes, the male would catch it through the open tip of his penis.  And since the condom covered me and her fluids didn't seep inside and all the way down, I should be fine.  This was comforting, and hopefully he's right.      I've been somewhat nervous about this.  While I think I should be fine, naturally I've thought about it at times.  What are the chances that I'm ok?  Am I overthinking this too much?  Should I stop worrying?  Thanks for your help.

Hi, I'm from Germany and very interested in the United Kingdom because it's such a lovely place to live.   Now I've got a thew questions about the National Health System.   Do you have to pay extra for some things?   In Germany the doctors sometimes ask the people if they want to do a (special) test, x-raying or medical check up for which they have to pay extra.   But sometimes this check ups are very important.   Do you have also to pay for some things the NHS doesn't pay although it would be very important?   Is it also such a disaster with the mental health hospitals in Britain?   In Germany the people have to wait for a date or when they want to be longer there about 3 months, which I think is a very long time.   And how is it with medicine in Britain?   Do the people also often not get the medicine they would need because it's too expansive and how long do you have to wait for an appointment with the doctor's?      Thank you very much in advance.

I'm a female/24 years old-This is in reply to my recent question regarding blood in urine.   -   I have been having UTI on and off for a year or two. First I took the AZO red cranberry pills. Now I bought the brown small pills.   I asked another question earlier and maybe this relates to it--   ***      I am having blood in my urine,on an off UTI, on and off abdominal severe pain for 10+years. Could it be cysts or kidney stones? I've never had it checked because I simply cannot afford the doctor. I do not have health insurance, have a part time job an trying to get on food stamps.   I just finished my period so I thought the blood was from that but it's not when I wipe.    I have been getting back pain on and off recently too. Clearly something is going on but I have no doctor.      Should I at least stop taking the AZO pills? Could they be making me feel worse?

20090307044221AAVmsdo	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will my metabolism slow down?	I'm almost 18 and my whole life I've pretty much been on the skinny side. I've never gotten fat and when I gained a few pounds they were usually gone within a matter of days.      My dad has been eating unhealthy since he was about 24, and he's 49 now. I don't know his exact weight but he is pretty obese. My mom on the other hand hasn't been very fat from what I've seen... My oldest brother is overweight but he also does not eat healthy.      My metabolism has always been extremely rapid, as I have tried eating as much as I could (not intentionally trying to gain weight.) and I never gained much.      Am I blessed with a fast metabolism? ... or will it slow down? Is it possible for it to slow down drastically?      Thanks.

(that burns roughly 1200 calories, although i shouldn't be counting)      if you could give me your opinion without telling me how many calories i've eaten, that would be great :)

20090306171418AAcK1wY	Health;Other - Health	Back hurts from years of carrying my backpack to and from school. What to do?	Since elementary school I've been carrying my backpack to and from school. The homework has been piling up since high school (I'm now in 12th grade) and I've been shoving a bunch of text books, heavy binders in it each day. It has always given me a sore back. There has really been nothing I can do about it though. My parents say 'lighten your load, don't take so much home!' But, what am I supposed to do? Stop doing some of my homework so I have a lighter backpack? I can't do that. From the start of lasy school year, I've been carrying my backpack on my right shoulder. I found that by doing this my back wasn't sore, and I didn't slouch as much as a I walked. However, my right shoulder blade area is starting to ache and has been doing so for the past few months. It has gotten to the point where it aches even if I'm not wearing my backpack and it's very uncomfortable while sitting long hours in an hard plastic chair at school.      I know I should go to the doctor, but I want to know what they might suggest I do before I go. Warm baths don't help. Would they send me to a massage place?

It becomes really hard to focus in class. It happens a lot during tests and notes.

20090306171349AAlxeO4	Health;Mental Health	My stupid anxiety/OCD! Help?	These past few weeks, I've been so anxious and feeling a whole bunch of emotions. Fear. Depression. Anger (at myself). The other day I went to the doctor's to ask my condition. He believes I don't have OCD, but he referred me to a psychiatrist for a better diagnosis. Here's my deal guys, tell me what do you think.      1. Everytime I read or listen to something a tad confusing (in grammar). I try my best to understand it, and I do. However, I get really anxious and I feel want to keep repeating it until it feels proper and right. Before I'd ritualize on one thought for like an hour. But now I realized to stop and wait until my anxiety and that particular thought is GONE. I still despise the anxious feeling! :@ And when it is actually confusing, I try my best to understand it by simplifying it into others words. However, it's like my mind has to properly understand it in the confusing words. It's makes me really fustrated and anxious as the more times I say the more confused and anxious I get.      2. If I read something that I do understand, sometimes I get fixated on it and feel like "Oh, what if I don't understand it" The same thing in the number one happens.      3. Because of all of this, I fear that I can't read a novel for pleasure or english class because of the reasons above. I honestly have mixed feelings. Fear of the anxious feeling, and anger at myself for even doing it. Also, I now have a bit of trouble falling asleep. Sometimes when I'm just about to be sleepy, I get a random rush of anxiety for reason. This is so fustrating. OMFG.      4. The thing that is right now currently and by far the most terrifying the my mind is kind of confusing to say. I'm like obesssing and worrying over why something I before use to use in grammar to help understand a phrase doesn't work for certain things, I kind of know why. Long story show, my solution to help my anxiety kind of didnt't work. And much like my above mentioned symptoms, its even worse as it was something I used to help my OCD/anxiety. I am panicking on what am I going to do now.      Basically, I believe my fears are :   1, I can't read anymore w.o the stupid feeling   2. I can't read at all   3. I'm making myself worse and actually down further down the road to a more severe form.      Does anyone know what Im going through? Any tips of optimism? =S I feel so fustrated and angry for even going through this. My first specialist appointment is in 3 months, what should I do in the mean time?
20090307014612AAmig6Y	Health;Diet & Fitness	HIIT instead of leg day?	i love doing hiit on the treadmill becuase i find it fun and challenging. but i also do leg workouts. however, since i do hiit on my off lifting days, my leg workouts fall right in between 2 hiit days.   so i was wondering if hiit could be a replacemet for leg workouts. so basically my question is does hiit build your leg muscles, or does it function like regular cardio?      my goals are to build more lean muscle and lose as much fat as possible.

I know some ppl don`t take the Miley thing too sierious but the point is I got hurt over it.      2. All of my close friends are moving away and I am stuck here in america. I have people that I hang with at school but they always make fun of me and push me around. I am tired of crying myself to sleep.      3. This girl emberrased me in front of the whole class and made my crus hate me. so i accidentaly cussed her out cuz I got so mad and now everyone in my class is against me and they treat me like a dirty virus.      4. whenever I cry noone helps me and many people just tell me to talk to a councler but i can NOT do that no matter what I do so DONT say anything about talking to counclers. I used to talk to them before and all they say to you is stupid cheesy stuff and make you more suicidal by calling social workers.

I'm 15 and I could lose a lot of weight.   Keep in mind that I normally get absolutely no activity at all (I do have a lot of stamina, strangely, so I can go through half an hour of cardio with no effort..), and once, I started losing a lot of weight by simply eating less (not different food, just a little less!), so I was wondering, if I eat healthier, together with playing tennis every week and doing cardio, how fast could I lose weight?      I don't overeat, I don't eat junk food (well, not too often.), I simply don't get any activity at all, and I think that's what's keeping me overweight, and I weight about..

So i got my mirena in wednesday, i haven't had children so they gave me voltarin and a drug that helps to soften the cervix for dialation. During and after the insertion i was in so much pain, vomiting, sweating, shaking and i couldn't stop moving from the pain. They sent me upstairs to the clinic hospital and stayed there for the day and went home when the pain became bearable enough to walk.       It's 5 days later now and it still really hurts (the pain comes in waves like contractions) and i've been taking tramadol regularly to slow down the pain. I can feel the strings, but something just tells me i shouldn't be this sore...

20090306233007AAaYCtZ	Health;Mental Health	Am I clinically depressed?	Um okay if you're going to be mean please don't answer at all.      I have been to two different psychiatrists in my life. I was very dishonest with both of them because: A) I was scared they would tell things to my parents and B) I did not want to be diagnosed with depression and have to go on medication.  The reason I went to the first one was because my parents were concerned about my behavior. Then I had a very emotionally traumatic experience in 9th grade and stopped eating and started self-harming (cutting). I hid my scars successfully for months until they finally saw one. I said it was an accident but they kept questioning me and finally I broke down crying. That is why I went to the second psychiatrist but I lied my way out of that one too. I was so good at making her think I was okay. Anyways, now it's three years later and I'm doing worse than ever. I'm using drugs (such as pain killers or huge doses of OTCs) every single day just to get through school and I have just started cutting again. My mood overall is very very bad. Do I have legit depression? If so, what can I do? I can't talk to my parents or friends. No one understands. Please, I really want help.      Although I often feel like I don't want to be alive, I don't think that I have the guts to actually kill myself. And deep down I feel like I'm waiting for something; or hoping that I'll eventually achieve happiness. Although that's highly unlikely.

He only wants to eat pizza and taco bell.  He also craves hot sauce, meat, and strangely he picks lint off blankets and eats it.  He was mildly anemic about a year and a half ago but he hasn't been back in for another test. The pedi didn't seem very worried about it then.  I came across this stuff called Kiddie Flourish and was wondering if anyone has tried it or knows anything about it? It is supposed to have natural ingredients to help boost appetite and immune system. I don't want to take him to the doctor and get him put on medication. He has been having lots of trouble sleeping at night and I think it is because he is hungry, but he doesn't want to eat anything but junk food or candy.  He drinks up to two sippy cups of juice throughout the night. He would rather have juice than food. I have tried to cut his juice down, but he still refuses to eat properly. Its just a few bites and he says he is full. Everyone is always telling me how small he is, and I just want him to grow a little more.

I have cat / seasonal / dust allergies and I live with 2 cats, who'd I'd love to get rid of but can't.  As a result I've seen general practitioners and allergists regarding chronic sinus congestion and inflammed nasal passages.        They have recommended and I've tried clariton / clariton-D, clarinex D, and zyrtec; each help with all my other allergy symptomns (sneezing, itchy throat, etc) but do nothing for the nasal inflamation and congestion.        The only things that work are Benodryl; but it knocks me out for four hours, and Wal-finate, but it only works for 3-4 hours at a time before I have to redose.      Afrin and other nasal steroids work great for the congestion/inflamation but the Doctors say I should not use those as they can perminately damage the tissues.

Also I don’t know if this is even relevant but I never have periods anymore well like one every three months or something and if I do its for like 2 days, I’m not complaining though  ^_^ it just seems odd.

20090307023247AAmXPrn	Health;Dental	Unsightly gap above my bridge?	About 5 or so years ago I had a bridge put in that uses my incisor and canine as support. Prior to the bridge being put in I had a root canal on the incisor.      Over the past few months a gap has appeared above the bridge at the incisor and the tooth has become visible at the top. This is very unsightly as the tooth is black underneath due to the root canal.      I went to my dentist and he said I need to use superfloss all around the top etc of the bridge and the gum might grow back. I was unaware of using floss like this but have been doing so. He also said that there is nothing he can do except change the bridge which will be costly. I cannot afford this.      Is there any real chance that the gum will grow back as I find it hard to believe? If not, is there any way he can patch it up? I have had a chip filled in before, can he not to that?

20090307030403AAivM1x	Health;Mental Health	Is it possible to beat borderline personality disorder?	I checked the DSM and I have none of the symptoms of BPD anymore. I did when I was younger, but set out on a mission to eliminate them.   In truth though I have to give my meds credit. I have found a combination that works for me. Without the meds I would probably go right back to emotional chaos. So, I guess it isn't beaten in that sense.   I tried joining a borderline support group just for fun and was taken aback at all the drama.     Can you ever say "cured" or is it remission? I am the first one (knowing my previous years) to tell someone in a relationship with a borderline to leave; that it doesn't get better.

I feel mostly wide awake all the time except after several hours I get extremely sleepy but can't fall asleep for more than 2-3 hours.      I've been on Lamictal (200 mg a day) for several months, Vistaril for helping me relax/fall asleep (4 months or so), and Zoloft for several years. I'm bipolar type II and recently have come off a bad depressed period (several years) and usually feel pretty "normal" since I've been on Lamictal, except for horrible nightmares and panic attacks.      I just got married a couple of weeks ago, I recently moved halfway across the country from my family and I miss them a lot. I keep worrying about weird things like for awhile I was worried I was pregnant because my appetite has become huge lately (not normal for me) and I've gained 5 lbs in less than 2 weeks. Another reason I might not be sleeping is I get really bad muscle spasms/pain in my shoulder/neck.      Anyway, to make a long story short, I really need some help or advice about the sleeping thing.

I am having tests done next week as my doctor is worried I might have Hodgkin's lymphoma. I have a very enlarged lymph node in my neck, which has been like that for about 18 months but over the past few months has been growing to the point where it is now visible protruding from my neck. It sounds so stupid now but I didn't actually realise anything was wrong as I haven't been in any pain. I've been feeling constantly exhausted and I've lost weight but I've been putting this down to the fact that I have a 7 month old baby. I've also been getting a very unusual amount of bruises although I'm not sure whether this is a sign of Hodgkin's. Over the past few weeks I've also discovered that the occipital lymph is also enlarged (again, not sure if this is a sign). However, I haven't had an night-sweats or fever. Can anyone tell me what the main symptoms of Hodgkin's Lymphoma are and if there are any that nearly every sufferer will get? Many thanks for your help.

School is making it really hard for me to deal with it too, what should I do? I have to do a monologue for drama, an oral for japanese, a maths test, humanities test and a science test in one week. I have always been quite and shy, always hiding any and everything from everyone so I can't tell my dad or school counciler about all this. I have always had the thought in my mind to just refuse to do something but I have never done it, i'm to shy but now I am really considering locking myself my bedroom and crying. I just can't stand to do anything any more. I go into hysteria for the smallest little thing just because I am so unstable. I just really need some help, at this point there isn't anything I can do about stopping me getting worse but school is literally forcing me to loose that last little grip I have on sanity. I can't take this any more! Please dont post anything mean about this, I only want posts that will help me through this.

20090307032146AA9lXf4	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Why does it suddenly feel like I'm not getting enough air into my lungs?	I've always had a slight problem with voluntarily breathing, because every time I'd do so I'd think that if I get distracted I'd stop breathing. I know it's not true, but it still worried me. That didn't happen often though, and it only lasted a minute or two.      Two nights ago, I'm not sure why (stress or a dream or something) I woke up with my heart beating fast and I felt like I was short of breath, so I was panicking and was trying to control my breathing. I couldn't go back to sleep until I got water and read a few chapters in my book to distract me.   Today, I've felt like I'm out of breath and I keep freaking myself out thinking it's getting worse and I'm eventually not going to be able to breath. Like, even when I'm eating or talking I get short of breath easily. A lot of my attention has been focused on breathing, but it never feels like I'm getting enough air so I'm making myself yawn a lot.   I also went to the doctors today for a physical and they said I was perfectly fine, and that I probably woke up due to stress.      I'm not overweight, I'm 14 years old, no allergies, no relatives with asthma, I exercise, I have a family member who smokes, and I also have hypochondriac-like behaviour. Am I having some sort of extremely-long panic attack? Or asthma? What can I do to calm myself down and stop worrying or what can I do to help? I can try to distract myself from it but it only helps for a few minutes.      Please help!   10 points to the most benevolent answer. Thanks!

Alright guys,      I know this might be a dumb question, but I was having some heart palpitations and I went and saw the doctor. After a bunch of tests it turns out I have premature ventricular contractions. Now, I asked the doctor if I was alright to be smoking weed ( I had quit doing it over a year before I got palpitations but my friends always do it and always try to get me to also) and he said it was probably best if I dont. He said it might lead to something called atrial fibrillation. when I researched this is seemed serious but said it only really happened in old people. Do you think this is a serious worry or was the doctor just being extra careful?      Also, I normally only drink on Fridays (only beer very very rarely do I drink hard liquor) ill have 5-6 beers. Do you think this is something I need to watch too? I dont want to risk my life over any of it. The doctor said I shouldnt get carried away with drinking, so not to drink too much, but how much is too much (2 drinks,3 drinks,4) ??      I am just finding that I am loosing friends because I stop doing social things like this. It's pretty dumb I know, but I am getting really depressed over it and I feel like I wont be able to have fun anymore. But if that's the case then so be it.      Thanks,      Connor

Your patients are the proud parents of a seemingly healthy two month old who has no apparent disorders of any kind. The parents ask you to provide a chiropractic assessment of their baby to rule out the possibility of any misalignments which may have occurred during the birth process. During the course of your history taking and examination protocols, the parents request information and advice from you regarding a number of health issues including nutrition and   immunization procedures, techniques, risks and benefits. They have heard a few media horror stories about possible immunization risks, but the family physician wishes to begin the immunizations shortly.   The mother asks, “Wouldn’t food additives and genetically modified foods pose an even greater health risk to me or the baby than immunizations?”   1. What public health issues arise here?   2. Do you, the chiropractor, have an obligation to provide the information requested? Are any of these chiropractic issues?   3. Are allowed to ‘editorialize’ or give a personal opinion?   4. How did the immunization issue become associated with chiropractic early last century?   5. Should the chiropractic profession take a position on organic foods/farming or the Genetically Modified Food issue?   6. Should the profession deal with these issues or leave them to medicine, naturopathy and homeopathy?

I went to the doctor after having nausea and stomach pain that wouldn't go away, with really intense bouts of severe pain at night.  I've been to the ER five times thinking something had burst or twisted or something.  I've had all the gall bladder tests done, had a endoscopy to look for ulcers or anything like that, stool samples, blood tests, and I just had a laproscopy done looking for endometriosis.  No one has found anything and my doctors don't know what to do next.      The weirdest thing is that this pain and nausea follows my menstrual cycle-it starts when I ovulate and gets worse until my period is over.  Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?  I feel like my doctors are close to giving up and I just want some answers.  Any suggestions I could give my doctors?  Thanks.

20090307053710AAiusLi	Health;Mental Health	Failed a test and feel completely rubbish?	After much preparation for my driving test, I sat it this morning. I was obviously apprehensive (who wouldnt be?), but knew I failed instantly when I had to brake suddenly behind a van at a roundabout. In total, I got a danger error and two serious's. My driving instructor keeps telling me not to be so despondent as I only got 8 minor errors, but I feel so thick and stupid. What's worse, I have my prelim exam for college on Monday, and now I have failed this test, it has put me in a bad frame of mind for then.      I was diagnosed with BPD a few weeks ago, and I think my reactions after the test have proven it. I burst into tears, and was completely gutted. I wasnt angry at the examiner, as he was only doing his job, but a friend of mine texted to ask how I got on, and I was so mad, I told him to **** off. He is a psychiatrist, and then made matters worse (he knows about my diagnosis) telling me to stop feeling sorry for myself, get DBT etc. I have completely dismissed this, and am ignoring him, I want nothing more to do with him.      Perhaps I am a bit all over the place just now, but I wanted this test so badly. My Grandad died of dementia in December past, and I made a promise to him that I was going to take care of my Nan. There isnt anything I can offer her except my love, and I want to give my Mum a break and take my Nan to the doctors or to the shops in the car, as she cant drive. I feel so dependant, I want to take care of HER! Plus, I work as a supply worker, and get shifts as and when needed. I am dependant on public transport (which is so infrequent) I cant hardly do any of the shifts and need a car. I love my job, and am quite happy with the one I have, but have had to go on jobseekers allowance as a result of no money coming in (eg, some shifts start at 7am, there is no transport then, and my Mum cant take me in then). I dont want another job, as I said, love the one I do, but I just want to get off JSA asap so they dont start hounding me for work (plus I dont like the stigma of being on benefits).      All afternoon, I have felt a complete idiot, and have been having a go at anyone because I feel such a failure. I am terrified about my exam on Monday. My Dad has made matters worse (he doesnt live with us), but has been sending texts implying I am thick. My sister is a vet and got good grades in her exams, I cant help but feel stupid.      How can I chill and calm down, especially for Monday?

20090307054141AAb3T84	Health;Mental Health	Smoking and autism!????	Hey well, I am 13 and my brother is almost 5. So, My mom was a smoker before she had me. I estimate about 2 years before she had me she quit. She had a miscarriage, then me (healthy). She had two more miscarriages in 8 years, then at last she had her last (my brother). While growing up my brother had delayed in speech and walking and playing more maturally, and a lot of tantrums. He had a OT and a PT come to our house and you know, play with him and get him better at things like speech and puzzles, and knowing his colors and objects. But before he knew speech, he knew sign langauge. His first word was cookie or yay (not sure if that is a word). Which I find impressive. In comparison in my first word was "No." Around 3 he was diagnosed with autism. Not servere, but a little less than mild. He doesnt look different in devolopment but he has the autistiv signs as shaking his hands or playing with toys at the kitchen table only (eye level) He now goes to a special pre-school. Also, he doesnt like me when im around him, I dont know why. Ok but the point here is, My mom told me the shot newborns just get in the hosipital at birth can cuase mental issues. She told me to never give my future kids the shot. Doctors never tell us anything.       So would the cause be the shot, or my mothers past-time smoking? Or did the autism come from an unknown reason?

Ok so for about 4 or so days now I've had this about quarter size oval bump on the BACK of my neck. It's pretty much a perfect oval and is a bit soft on the outside but if pressed down it is hard underneath. It is also a bit sore to the touch though this has seemed to have gotten better today. Also since yesterday I've been developing a fairly bad cough. Nothing like coughing up blood or nonstop coughing but its definitely noticeable. And on top of this I've had pretty bad throat congestion (mucus, etc). I do  sometimes anyways, but I think it may have worsened due to my illness. Those are my only symptoms however, my throat doesn't seem to be that sore and I have nothing else noticeably wrong. Has anyone had something similar to this before? I know I should probably go to the doctor and I more than likely will if this doesn't go away but before I do I want to know if its something I need to worry about or not.

I do, however, want to find a girl friend that I can talk to, have fun with, go to the movies, and just do normal things that friends do.   The problem is that I am so shy and I don't know how to talk to girls and I can't even make eye contact without blushing and looking away!   I am always looking at the ground and I know people can see that and are uncomfortable around me and don't want to get involved with me because I show my low self-esteem.   How can I appear to have a higher self-esteem and feel better about myself so I can appear friendlier and more easy going to make friends?   Thank you in advance.

20090307070623AABrowP	Health;Mental Health	Thinking of going on the sick.  What are my rights?	I have been really struggling with my mental health for years.  A couple of weeks ago my boss called me an ambulance because I had a really bad panic attack at work and it really freaked him out.  Since then I have had panic attacks two - three times a day.  My acid reflux has been so bad that I'm in constant pain, despite antacids, and yesterday I was just completely out of it.  I got up for work and was just getting changed when the dizziness and nausea was getting really bad.  I was completely space-out and didn't feel able to hold a conversation so I texted my boss to tell him I was feeling really unwell but would try and come in later because I had a lot to do.  Then I must have just conked out.  My boss phoned me because he hadn't received my text for some reason and I tried to explain but I was all over the place and just kept stumbling over my words and talking nonsense.  Every time I go outside I feel as if I'm going to faint and I simply don't feel like I can go on.  I didn't want to give up work because I want to live a normal life but this week I've been getting done in a day what I would normally get done in an hour.  Everything's building up on me and I feel both mentally and physically unwell all the time.  I can't eat or I eat too much, I can't sleep or I can't stay awake, I feel extremely confused and "out-of-it" all the time.  It's very frightening.     I'm thinking of going on the sick for a month to change my medication.  The doc has recommended I change but I knew I would get alot worse through withdrawal before I got better and I didn't want to risk screwing up at work even more than I am now.  If I ask to be signed off for the time that I'm going to feel worse with the intention of going back once my health is improved will I still get paid full wage?  I can't afford any less.  Can my boss sack me?  Could he sack me once I go back?  Is it really a good idea to take time off for any reason?

20090307060656AA7ogO3	Health;Mental Health	I'm having suicidal thoughts. What can I do to stop them?	Lately I've been having suicidal thoughts. I've been depressed for a while, but the last couple of months my depression has become more prominent. I feel totally worthless and feel that my life is going nowhere, and that there's no point in my existing any longer. I hate myself so much, I wish I could change who I am and become someone else entirely. No-one really seems to like me very much, and I don't know why. By no means am I a mean person. I'm just not very good at socialising with people, most times I just don't know what to say. Other people always seem to have something to talk about, and I have nothing at all. Other people make witty remarks and come up with good comebacks, but I can never come up with any and if I try to say something humorous people just look at me like an idiot, which is why I don't say anything anymore. The only way I can be funny is if it's something at my expense, such as falling over or something like that. I tend to care a lot about what people think of me as well which is exhausting. I just want to be able to not care about other people's perceptions of me, and it's for these reasons that I'm beginning to have suicidal thoughts. It seems that everyone I know would be better off without me, including myself.
20090307060705AASpWgC	Health;Diet & Fitness	Please help me lose weight?	I have tried everything to lose weight! I drink green tea in the morning with breakfast, do about an hour and a half of workouts, jog 2 miles. I drink only water throughout the day. I eat very very healthy and never eat after 5 pm. I even stooped so low as to try diet pills for a month(which i totally do not want to do) and nothing is helping me to loose weight. I've been at this for about 6 months and nothing. I'm not even looking any toner. I weighed 142lbs when I started and have only lost 2lbs since. I am now 140lbs and have the exact same measurements as I did at the beginning. I'm at my wits end with all of this. I'm only 5'5 so 140 doesn't look good on me at all. I would love to at least get down to around 132 and to tone up. Any suggestions would be helpful. And please don't say surgery. I want to lose weight in as healthy a way as possible. Thanks =)
20090307065510AAFssH2	Health;Other - Health	3 yr old daughter been sick with flu symptoms for 4 days. how do I stop her from throwing up?	So my 3 yr old has been feeling pretty sick the last few days. It started with a fever and then progressed to diarreah and then to vomiting. And I have tried everything to make her feel more comfortable. We were out yesterday and I thought that it had finally passed through her... but out of nowhere she started throwing up and then the whole way home she would fall asleep and then wake up crying in agony holding onto her tummy like she was cramping up. Then she would try and throw up but only saliva came up... I am not understanding what is wrong with her. I know that it is obviously a virus and can last a few days but I am concerned that it is going on for too long and especially with her not eating anything. Any ideas help or suggestions to what I should do will be helpful. Thank you

20090307060828AAjgbKy	Health;Women's Health	Do you think I had a light period or implantation bleeding?	My period came a week LATE, so I'm guessing it's not implantation bleeding, since that usually happens earlier.  However, I use Mirena birth control, and the claim is shorter, lighter periods or none at all. I have had Mirena for over 1 1/2 years and my periods are usually on time with a medium flow and lasting 6-7 days.  However this time, it was very, very light pink and only showed up 1-3 times a day ONLY when I wiped.  This lasted for 3 days.  Then nothing for the next 3 days, then light pink again ONE time when I wiped on that day.  Then gone.  No clots, absolutely no spots of bright red blood.  So since I have mirena, I am guessing this is what a light period would be, since the odds of actually getting pregnant on it are very low.  I have taken a pregnancy test 3 days after the last spotting, just in case, but obviously negative. What do you think?

20090307064345AAXtpLm	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do I tell the difference between wide hip bones and love handles?	So let's have a look at the details:       As long as I remember I've had love handles, I can understand why, between 13 and 17 I ate pretty irresponsibly. 2 months after my 18th Birthday I joined a gym and started being responsible (sort of). I went from 100kg (220lb) to my current 72kg (158lb) - so a 28kg drop in weight in 8 months. As much as I feel great now, and can confidently wear a singlet (albeit my skin has suffered terribly) I still feel self conscious to wear any slightly fitting shirts.      From the side on I appear to be normally proportioned, but from the front my "love handles" seem to still be quite prominent. Maybe not so much as they were. So really what I'm trying to ask is, can a part of your body with no muscles in it (the outsides of your hip) be reduced in size. Not necessarily spot reduction, cause I've searched every part of the internet, so i've worked that much out.      But has anyone else who's lost weight had this issue.      Or maybe my body is just catching up.

Hello, well almost a week ago early sunday morning i was so desperate to get high (didn;t have skins or anything) but had the weed, so anyways i made an apple bong, smoked like a few hits felt a bit good then went all out and smoked a bud in one cause it was so easy. I stood up couldn't walk properly and had a panic attack that lasted about 4 hours, the whole feeling your dieing etc.   I know its all in the head because weed gets our of your system in like 6 hours or whatever, but i still feel dreamy now, like a bit like when im ill feeling lightheaded, I'm writing on here because some reassurance would help settle me and if people have had a similar experience i would like to know how long it took them to get over the anxiety, like i can control it if i try and i've avoided another anxiety/panic attack, but i've had a headache for a weak now and rarely can stop thinking about the way i feel.    I'm not writing on here for people to tell me never to smoke it again (cause i won't) it was a clear sign from my body to stop ******* about. Just want a little help and guidance to how i can 'snap' out of this and get back to normal as quickly as possible, cheers.

But I feel like I have snacking alot, I am surprised I have not gained weight. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.
20090307065224AAsTcNU	Health;Optical	Where can I find simple reading glasses that have no correction on top?	I would like to find some reading glasses that I can wear all the way on my nose without "peeking" over them to see at distance.  In other words, the magnification would be on the bottom, and they would be clear on top.  Alternatively, the lens would be a half lens, so that I would not be looking through the lens at all except when looking down to read.  I'd rather not spend the money to have some made by an optometrist if I can find some simple readers.  If you find them online, please include a link in your answer.  Thanks!

20090307065334AAXRxtL	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	In SO much pain with broken wrist, can anyone please help?	3 days ago i broke my wrist (distal radius).  On the x-ray they noticed a couple of other bones were further apart than they're supposed to be which made them suspicious of ligament damage.  I was booked an appointment with a orthopaedic surgeon yesterday and he decided to operate to have a look.  Turned out the ligament was torn so he pinned the bones back in place and fixed the ligament (i apparently now have pins sticking out my wrist).      Anyway it is now AGONY.  I was given percocet and tylenol 3 (paracetamol, caffeine and codeine).  I finnished the percocet (wasn't given that many) and they only just took the edg of the pain and now im left with tylenol 3 which make no difference atall.      Is there anything else i can do?? Would ice help?        Im not keen on more percocet becauce they spaced me out a lot and i couldnt do much.       Thanks.

I've done some searching, but haven't really found much information. It seems the only real help available has to be paid for and the prices are extortionate at best.      I don't have much money myself, and neither does the person I wish to help.      If anyone has any information on the laws governing addiction, IE, what can be done to someone unwilling to seek help themselves, I'd also greatly appreciate that. I'm wondering if there is some power such as that used under the Mental Health act that relates to drug abuse.      Thank you in advance for your responses.
