20070314184724AAKdAoE	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Texto argumentativo o expositivo y por que? 10pt easy?	El amor, la búsqueda del conocimiento y una insoportable piedad por el sufrimiento de la humanidad. Estas pasiones, Me han arrastra de un sitio para otro, en un áspero curso, sobre un profundo océano de angustia alcanzando el límite preciso de la desesperanza. He buscado el amor, primero porque brinda éxtasis -un éxtasis tan grande que a menudo he sacrificado todo el resto de vida por esas pocas horas de alegría. Lo he buscado, además, porque libera de soledad -esa terrible soledad en la que la conciencia temblorosa mira por sobre el borde del mundo al frío e insondable abismo de ?a muerte. Lo he buscado finalmente porque en la unión del amor he visto, en una miniatura mística, la visión prefigurada del cielo que los santos y los poetas han imaginado. Esto es lo que he  buscado, y aunque parezca   demasiado bueno para la vida humana, esto es lo que -finalmente- he encontrado. Con igual pasión busqué el conocimiento. He deseado entender el corazón de los hombres...

Basically, the same as above (a two part question):     1.  what's the difference b/w a theme and thesis (in relation to an structured essay), and       2.  Is a theme essentially the topic/subject of the essay (while the thesis reveals a main idea that is supported by examples and evidence pertaining to the topic)      3.  does the thesis have to be universal (for example:  the symbol of __________ in the essay reveals that "ONE" should ....etc.) or is it allowed to pertain to the specific work of literature (book, poem, etc.) that is the subject of the essay (for example, the symbol of ________ is used in the novel to portray the nature of a certain character and reveal society's perception of that character...etc.)      Obviously, I'm just using "the symbol of" as an example, I suppose a thesis could also pertain to a motif or other topic.

20090131092415AAV9aGC	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Speech for Oral Comm Class...Animal Testing..What do you think, thoughts and suggestions good and bad needed!!?	Each year 100 million animals are used worldwide in experiments.  They are used mainly to test the toxicity levels of anything from cleaning products to medications.  There are many arguments for and against this practice, but for many people one fact remains the same, using animals in a cruel manor is wrong.  There are two main reasons for conducting animal experimentation, first, to find out more about the animals themselves, and, secondly, to test substances and procedures to see if they are harmful to humans.  There is a growing consensus that it is not acceptable to test cosmetic products on animals. The debate is about whether we should experiment on animals for scientific and medical purposes.       Past experience has shown what invaluable advances can be made in medicine by experimenting on animals, and that live animals are the most reliable subjects for testing medicines and other products for toxicity.  Testing on animals has helped develop vaccines for many life threatening diseases and virus’s related to organ transplantation rejection.  In addition to this, animal testing has also helped in the improvement of procedures related to measuring the blood pressure, and pacemaker technology.  In fact, many of the medications vaccines and surgical techniques used today would not be around if it were not for animal testing.  Supporters for animal testing argue that research is justified because it assists in discovering ways to help people and other animals for the future. Animal testing has also helped other animals, for example the heartworm medication that was devised from research on animals has assisted many dogs. Cat nutrition has been better understood through animal research and has assisted cats to live longer and healthier lives.   The major problem most people have with animal testing is that in many cases it is not carried out humanely.  Many of the animals used are kept in terrible conditions with little care, and when they are not needed anymore they are killed.  The critics of animal testing base their argument on the grounds of morality, the necessity these procedures, and whether it is being carried out by people with proper authority to perform such tests.  Deaths through research are considered unnecessary and are morally not different from murder.  Others argue that the reaction of an animal to a drug is quite different than that of a human being. In the United States there are products that are required by law to be tested on animals before becoming available for Human use.  For example the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires by law that pesticides be tested on dogs, who are shoved into inhalation chambers where they are exposed to deadly poisons being pumped into their chambers, the FDA requires that companies marketing fluoride products, such as toothpaste, swab the teeth of 200 rats with the test substance for two weeks, at which time the animals are killed.  It is seen by many people as unfair to the animals, they have the right to life just as any human does, and there are alternatives to these practices.   In many cases it would, however, be difficult to test new drugs or chemicals on anything but animals.  When testing on animals has the possibility of curing a disease, or preventing toxic chemicals from entering the shelves for the public to ingest, it becomes seemingly impossible to find a way to put an end to this practice.  There are other ways animals can be tested.  In many cases it is not necessary for the animal to be euthanized after their research period is over but in almost all of these cases they are killed.  Without getting to deep into the science of it there are ways to test new drugs and medical advances that are harmless to humans and animals, with the technological advances of today’s society there are some research firms which use only human tissues and advanced computer technology in the process of drug development and testing, in some cases this method has proven to be more effective than the tests used on animals. Now and in the future computer models can be used to devise the reaction of a drug to the animal; as a result it would eliminate the necessity for live animal experimentations.  The development to the extensive application of substitutes to animal experimentation will persistently gain momentum as people become more aware about the problem.    Though it is hard to eliminate animal testing completely, consumers can prevent the unnecessary animal testing by boycotting certain products that don’t necessary require animal testing. To conclude, all we can do now is to try to reduce the number of animals being harmed in these experiments aimed at benefiting society.

20090131090726AAkB7XC	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	A few financial aid questions...?	I'm a high school senior and I have just started applying for financial aid.  My mom just got her W2's yesterday so I started to apply and apparently you also have to have your taxes filed to apply because I got to a question that asked how much she received from taxes and she didn't have a sure answer.      Anyway she has an appointment to do her taxes on February 21st.  Someone told me if you apply for aid too late that you may not get any.  Am I going to be in trouble?  My mom is a single parent and there's not much she can really do financially to get me into college.      Also my college of choice has a priority financial aid deadline of March 1st which is just a week after she does her taxes.  I heard it takes 3-4 weeks to process your financial aid and receive and SAR.  Since my college would receive the SAR after the deadline would I be denied aid?  Or do they just want me to complete the application by the 1st?      Any help is greatly appreciated; if you have some other helpful financial aid info also please post it :)  Thanks.

20090131131236AANV0NO	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	High School Student looking at colleges?	Hi, I'm a sophomore in high school, and I've just started to search for the right college. I'm not really sure where to begin, or what makes a college right for me, and was looking for some suggestions based on the information I can provide for you. I'm really interested in natural and animal sciences, I've always wanted to go abroad and help to preserve the world's tropical rain forests (I'm especially interested in protecting some of the primates that live in those regions), I am able to go (meaning that my family won't object to the distance, not that I will necessarily get in) to any school in the United States, I want to go to a four year university, and would prefer not to go to school in Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Indiana, or Ohio. I'm also a straight A student, and am in an advanced Sciences program. I do volunteer work at a local animal shelter, and plan to try to work with a wildlife rehabilitation facility this summer. Thanks for any suggestions or ideas!

20090131131614AAqZXEg	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How can I regain some of my motivation for school?	For several years I've always been the one that would be eager for school to begin but lately that's changed.  I'm a sophomore, a straight A student, and my rank is 2 out of a class of 262.        Sometimes I just feel that the work is a waste of time and I have no desire to do it.  I usually get this type of "lost motivation" feeling in the last month of school but I got it after the first quarter ended.      I don't want my grades to slip and disappoint my parents.  Sometimes I get a bit frustrated because I feel that since I've always gotten high marks it's almost as if they aren't happy about it anymore.  It's just like an "Oh you got an average of 97?  Nice. Keep it up."  They show no sort of emotion and it really gets me angry.      Recently, I've been missing some assignments (not too many) just because I have lost my desire to excel in school.  I never thought I would be saying but it would be impossible to hide that fact.      Do you guys have any tips in continuing to do well when you're completely fed up and tired with school?

When my friend goes on msn and asks if he likes me, he says he dosent know me well enough, but he didnt say no. He also invited me to movies, but when the day came he said that he has no ride there and he will make it up to me. so i dont understand. whats the deal... im confused. and whenever he says bye he always puts a hear or something at the end. so is he interested?
