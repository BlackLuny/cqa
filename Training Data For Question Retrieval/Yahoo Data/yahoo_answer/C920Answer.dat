RNqRnG86aa	With seemingly good intentions, Congress enacted the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977. Congress felt that everyone deserved a home of their own and that banks were excluding too many from home ownership by having credit standards that were far too stringent. In effect the act compelled banks to loosen their credit standards so that more people could qualify for mortgages. This led to loans being made to borrowers who, all too often, could not repay them.<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve held interests rates way too low for too long. Because money was cheap it helped create a housing bubble.<br>  <br>  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac turbocharged the credit mania. They were able to borrow at rates below prime because they had the implicit backing of the federal government even though they were supposedly private corporations. They were able to buy the sub prime loans from the banks and make a tidy profit on the interest spread.<br>  <br>  Mortgage lenders like Countrywide and others originated sub-prime mortgage loans of questionable value and really didn't care if the borrower could fulfill the terms of their loans because they sold the loans to Fannie and Freddie or with the help of Wall Street bundled the loans into asset backed bonds. Wall street pushed these securities as safe debt instruments when, in fact, they were near worthless. <br>  <br>  The credit rating agencies that are supposed rate the fundamental value of these debt securities failed miserably. Bank and SEC supervision was non-existent over the last several years.<br>  <br>  Put them all together and you can see that you had banks eager to lend money to people who could not afford homes they were buying at artificially inflated prices because of easy money. The Banks did not really care if the loans would be a problem in the future as they would sell the mortgage to Freddie or Fannie or bundle the loans into a debt security with a high yield and that investors thought were relatively safe. The rating agencies did not alert investors. Congress and the SEC just stood by and refused to believe there was a problem. Eventually the house of cards fell when the borrowers defaulted on their mortgages.<br>  <br>  The resulting credit crisis has brought economic activity to a halt.|`|AA10469473	A lot of it tracks back to the collapse of the housing market, which was caused in large part by loosening of mortgage requirements in the late 90's so people ended up with mortgages they couldn't afford, especially the adjustable rate mortgages.|`|m0lr4dalaa	looking through the many causes, one thing comes up common - debt. America has accumulated so much debt more than it can make money. Brought about by two very expensive wars, bad economic policies, and a domino effect that has been far reaching than anyone had first thought, America is back in a recession touted by many as the worst that they've seen yet. <br>  <br>  The two expensive wars that America had waged on Afghanistan, then Iraq had resulted to trillions of dollars spent but with very little monetary return. They've been acted upon on poor intelligence data and worsened by a strengthening enemy and a complicated society in those countries. Those trillion of dollars they've spent came from the US Treasury (the big wallet) and in turn came from the pockets of the US Taxpayers. It still hasn't been paid and as a result adds to the mounting debt the US have now.<br>  <br>  bad economic polices that have been left unchecked from all these years was the  turning point that ushered the arrival of the recession. It was a concerted effort made by the financial institution to basically make money out of debt, and by the democrats who wanted for people that can't afford a house to own one. To put it into perspective, US lenders basically made people borrow money to spend, mostly to buy houses, even when those borrowers had no security that they can pay it off in the long run. even worse, they also allowed the same people to borrow money off the value of their borrowed house (that's borrowing money from a debt you already have). then the lenders gathered these people who borrowed money, their debts, into attractive bundles (called hedge funds) and sold it to other institutions as stocks. This was fine during the time when the US had unprecedented economic boom brought about by high oil prices and high consumer spending - the good times. But when consumers finally spent all their money that they could possibly have, thanks to high commodity prices (gas, shopping goods), they've racked up so much debt that they can't spend anymore. and one by one, homeowners were gving back their borrowed homes back to lenders whom they got it from. multiply it by thousands across the country and those hedge funds, those bundles of debt that institutions  were counting on to make money as stocks became worthless all of a sudden. and they came big since it turned out that almost all financial institutions held such stocks entirely or some of it in their portfolio. with the staggering loss of money, many of them collapsed dragging each and everyone that had a connection with a bank in some way or another with their demise. and so the recession began with no money to go around and no money being made. the worst irony here is even with the sea of debt the US is swimming around now, little of it are the kind that they can use to run the economy. <br>  <br>  finally came the snowball, a far reaching catastrophe that is more widespread than first thought. Banks were losing money and a result no money to be borrowed around. since most businesses operate on credit to run day to day expenses, the banks have made their operations difficult as there is no money to borrow and as a result many of them had been closing doors even the big automakers. financial institutions also lost money, money that belonged to everyday americans who invested their hard earned money to them as retirement funds or counting on them as pension. this is why these institutions are being bailed out with government money as their failure would mean disastrous to the affected citizens. job losses mount as work runs out, another casualty of the recession. the rest of the world wasn't spared as most of the financial markets had a stake in the US economy through trade and investment, including those hedge funds. Afterall, the US economy runs the world economy - once the ordinary citizens in the US stop spending, then the rest of the world takes a beating. So Americans should really realize that previlidge and be responsible about it.<br>  <br>  The US election ushered "change" in the government however it would still remain to be seen. So far, Obama, has signed trillions of dollars, even more debt, to revive the economy. If it is managed well, it could probably restart the US and the world economy on a new page. If not, it's really hard to predict how much harder the future will be.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Too many people kept borrowing too much money for too long.

And they became a lot more careful about lending more money in order to avoid such losses in the future.  <br>  <br>  And since most people borrow money to buy various expensive things and houses, now these people can't borrow much and can't buy much.<br>  <br>  Which has made many factories and companies unnecessary for production of expensive goods and services.

ug00j0S8aa	No, not a guess.  Consider this:  federal refunds and credits are never income.  The $7500 is a zero interest loan; you are going to pay it back.  My problem with citing a source is that no has ever even suggested this.  The IRS topic below discusses the 2008 credit.  It does not say it is income.  It does say it must be paid back, with certain exceptions.|`|A1kiUMgvaa	Given the fact that you bought the house in 2008 you were eligible for a $7,500 no interest loan from the government.

A1kiUMgvaa	When SBBT gave you 3/13 they were assuming that the IRS would release the refund to them on 3/10 which is likely the normal range from when you had your return prepared.  Well this year nothing is normal and the IRS is at least a week behind schedule.  It takes a day or two for the funds to get from the IRS through SBBT and on to you.  How fast that happens also depends on the means that you are to receive the funds.  Oddly the longest time is with direct deposit in most cases.|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	Only IRS would know when  your refund will be issued.

Kidding aside here are some things to consider. Tell the landlord so you don't have it over your head ...its like a pebble in your shoe...lying (not disclosing) will be this little thing in the back of your head and with a few other small troubles will add undue stress. Experienced landlords expect this. Everyone knows that the death of a pet is traumatic and people usually replace the pet quickly. If you level with them "froofie died all of a sudden and I got a new pet and totally forgot to get it approved by you ...the loss of froofie had me not thinking straight and I value our relationship....is it ok? its the same size and I'll name his middle name after you if you do!"<br>  <br>  Now if the contract doesnt have the pets specific name then you can whip out the legal hat and say it just defines that you can have two pets of this type. Hopefully you got a pet of the same type. If you go out of the breed and get a pitbul or rot or other dogs that affect the landlords insurance liability then you might have a problem for not notifying him if something happens. If the pets names are not specified and the new one is the same breed then you are ok and make its middle name webhoo.....hahahaha|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Depends on what the lease says.

Some states collect property tax the same year, some the following year.  My county bills taxes the following year, so 2006 tax was not due until 2007.

AA11458672	Business Interruption cover:<br>   <br>  Net income that would have been earned before income taxes. This includes the net sales value of production for manufacturing risks; plus <br>  <br>  Continuing normal operating expenses, including payroll. <br>  <br>  Example: Paul’s Pony Supplies earned $120,000 during the past 12 months. However, a contract just signed guarantees a minimum of $250,000 for the next 12 months. If a business income loss occurs, it is based on the current situation, including the signed contract.<br>   <br>  In addition, this definition states that the net income figure can be either a net profit or a net loss. A time element loss can occur even in cases of a net loss because the other element of business income is the expenses that continue after a loss, such as payroll. <br>  <br>  Example: Even though Marianne is caught in an economic downturn, she is determined to keep going. She has a dozen employees and knows that business will improve in the next quarter. Unfortunately, a fire badly damages her business before the upturn begins.

AA10469473	The new lower withholding hasn't kicked in yet, so it sounds like he either changed his W-4 or didn't make enough this pay period to have any tax deducted.<br>  <br>  The IRS doesn't have to "track down" anybody.  Like any other year, tax liability will be calculated on a tax return, and compared to what had been withheld, then if not enough was withheld the person has to pay the extra.  If he's making enough to have much withheld, then he'd most likely get most of the extra money in his paychecks, and the end of the year would look about the same for him as it usually does.<br>  <br>  He should have zero allowances on his W-4.  If he has one, or exempt, he needs to change that to avoid owing at the end of the year.|`|AA11284831	If he typically has to pay $600 when he files, he almost certainly is claiming 1 allowance on his W-4.  As a dependent, he needs to change that to 0.  Alternatively he needs to ask his employer to withhold an additional $15 or so per week to cover his tax liability.  If he doesn't change anything, he'll still be looking at a $600 debt at filing time.

Sorry, but you are unable to write off the expenses of the wedding.  <br>  <br>  What being married does though is give you the opportunity of choosing whether you want to file a tax return as married filing jointly or married filing separately.  Before you file compare the two filing statuses.  Many times it could be better to file separately.  Also if you are in a taxing state, do this both ways to see which would give you the best bottom line tax.  Be sure and take into consideration that most credits and deductions are not allowed if married filing separately.<br>  <br>  If one of the taxpayers has little or no income then by being married and filing jointly this gives you a more beneficial use of the standard deduction and personal exemptions.  The standard deduction is double filing jointly than if you were single.  <br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|AA10469473	You can file a joint return, which will probably give you lower taxes,  But wedding expenses are not deductible.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	Unfortunately you cannot write off any of the expenses involved in the wedding as these were personal expenses that are non deductible.  <br>  <br>  However you can now file jointly which should have a tax advantage for you, especially if only one is working or has a substantially less income situation.<br>  <br>  Overall, the marriage is to your tax advantage.

ePYkqkNdaa	If you deposited money yesterday, you shouldn't have a problem spending that money today.  If you are depositing funds that you will need to have immediate access to, you need to deposit it as cash.  Cash is cash, no banking institution needs to be involved, therefore there is no lapse in time from the time you deposit it to the time it shows up.  It's immediate.<br>  <br>  Now, let's say you have 300 dollars in your account, a check from someone you want to deposit as cash and that check is for 500 dollars.  There is a good chance based on your banking activity and the fact that the check is less than YOUR collected balance that the teller will not allow a deposit as cash.  They have to protect themselves if a check looks fishy and basically you need to be able to cover the amount.<br>  <br>  The solution!  Look at the check the person has given you.  What bank do they use?  You can always go cash checks given to you outside your bank at the check "sender's" institution.  If it is not too much trouble that is how I would manage it.  <br>  <br>  Not every check you get will be from someone who banks locally.  The above wouldn't work in that scenario.<br>  <br>  Cash is king.  <br>  <br>  Like the other post below mentions...Anything deposited after (diff in some cases) 3p.m. on a Friday, even though the bank is open on Sat, will show up available on Tuesday.  The Friday deposit will actually have Monday's date!  That's just how it works.  Bank early on Fridays or earlier in the week.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	If it was cash it should go straight on to your account .

If they have cut-off times, and you deposited after that time yesterday, then your money most likely won't be available until Monday.  If you try to use it, you will either be declined or incur overdraft charges.  <br>  <br>  Contact the bank and ask about their cut-off times....they will be able to help you more.|`|QdtppqFPaa	Call your local branch.  Cash should be immediately available.  Hopefully you saved your deposit receipt to prove the transaction.  If the deposit was a check, chances are it won't be available until Monday or Tuesday.

DPMsgxHMaa	I would be rich if I could see the best game plan with an eye to the coming years!<br>  <br>  If you can sell your current house and make some money, I would suggest that you do it since in the not too distant future, its value is more likely to go down than go up.<br>  <br>  As far as what you do about purchasing a home, the only advice I can give you is to purchase something you would be happy to live in for a long while.  Not having a mortgage payment every month is a very nice feeling, however if you need the mortgage interest to offset income from dividends or interest on your savings, take out the smallest mortgage possible that will accomplish that fact.  <br>  <br>  If it was me, I would buy a home in a nice established neighborhood, taking out a small mortgage to have the tax deduction and plan on being there a while.  I would be very leery of new developments since these homes are bound to be more expensive and if this "big employer" has more layoffs and more people lose their jobs, the value of the "new developments" are the first things to take a plunge.<br>  <br>  Talk to an accountant and see what the ramifications would be if you had no mortgage interest to deduct.  Then do some soul searching and figure out how you truly want to live.  A smaller home means lower taxes, utility costs and maintenance and therefore you could put more money into savings or "under the mattress!"  But overall my opinion is that we should live in the smallest house we are comfortable in, so that may be coloring my answer.|`|U3jZFawtaa	I house that in ten years has shot up.....ok but has it dropped allot in the past 18 months? Values are down everywhere so I'm curious. Do you owe anything on it? Can you rent it and buy something and not stretch yourself?<br>  <br>  if at this point you have plenty of money in stocks still and you have a home with considerable equity even if the market goes down some it is closer to the bottom than it was so you should be ok.<br>  <br>  Loan modifications going on now means you might be able to pick up a phenomenal fixed rate on the new one. Have you got the numbers? Putting some money down so you are in an equity position, keeping the existing and renting it out and riding it out ...Is that possible and not have it keep you up at night?<br>  <br>  My thinking if the value is great now it will be even better 2 years from now when all this clears out. I own 17 properties purely on the rule to own it right , get into the next one right , dont refi/cashout and never sell. Its been 15 years and now I have some that will be paid off in less than 10 years (I do bi monthly payments on some).  Im 46 self employed and in an industry that is facing hard times. However like you I have reserves and am in properties with the right equity ratio. <br>  <br>  Something to think about because I dont see how now is when you will be getting the best price for your home. 2 yrs yes but now? with all the lenders freezing lending and gobs and gobs of foreclosures selling around you for a fraction? Doesnt seem likely. <br>  <br>  Get a BankOwned/ShortSale list in your market (send me your city,state I can get you one)then ask your bank how tight lending has been. Put 2+2 together and you might see now is not the time to sell but a great time to buy.

AA11659150	I wouldn't do that.  It's illegal and the IRS will get you.  Just go somewhere and offer to pay cash.  And then do it.  Or your credit will get worse.<br>  <br>  Add - Everyone and their mother does NOT smoke pot.  You seem quite confused about what is right and wrong.  I have to believe that you can't seriously be considering doing this?  It's a joke right?<br>  <br>  And while I can't promise you will regret it if you do it (bc I am not sure you understand why it's wrong in the first place), you will definitely end up in jail if (likely when) they catch you.  This will not only affect your ability to buy the car, but the IRS will expect you to pay taxes on this income you are claiming.  And they have ways of finding out these things, even if you say "oh they are fake and I won't report them".  Dealerships check on things like pay stubs AND your employer will likely not be dumb enough to lie for you.  I promise, it would be so much better to try to make a cash payment on a car you can afford without credit and wait until your credit straightens out.|`|kifwyOgKaa	No, it won't work, because the dealership will call to verify employment and your income.<br>  <br>  ***ADD***It's illegal, sheesh.<br>  ***ADD***I don't smoke marijuana, neither does my fiance, or anyone I know honestly.  Do you really want your manager to have something like that over your head?|`|on9xLWegaa	smoking pot isn't a felony, what you are suggesting is (on many levels).|`|hl4kkvXhaa	So...how do you plan to drive around in your new "wheels" while you're sitting in prison?  Falsifying documents like this is a federal crime.  Forgery.  It's nothing like smoking weed (which, by the way, not everyone does it...I don't, and neither does anyone in my family, and I find that an insult).  But, once you forge the check stubs, and if you do happen to find some idiot willing to loan you money without a complete credit check, you also have to forge the contract you sign for payment...second federal forgery crime.  Forgery isn't just signing your name to a document...it's putting any false information on a document.  And, get your manager involved, and he goes down with you.  That's two federal prison candidates...and how will you get a job in this crummy economy once you have that conviction on your record?<br>  <br>  It wouldn't work anyway because banks check into this stuff.  They contact your current employer to see if you are actually there and if so, how much you earn.  They also check your credit history, so the $1000 will show up anyway.  If you'd stop and just pay off the debt which didn't double for nothing, but rather because you failed to pay your obligation, you wouldn't have that as a red mark on your credit check.<br>  <br>  Look.  Use the downpayment to buy you a cheaper car for now and stop with the materialistic mentality.  We can't all have fancy rides, and there's no sense in being immature and putting yourself further in debt for something you might not be able to pay back.  What happens if you lose your source of income?  It's entirely possible these days, and you have to think ahead.<br>  <br>  Next.  Pay off the $1000 debt.  If you have downpayment money, you should have done this in the first place.  You complain about the economy, but the little stunt you want to pull is a big factor in why this economy is as bad as it is!  People wanting to live beyond their means and buying up more than they can afford.  Buy modestly for now, and when the economy picks up, and you have a better job, then get the nice shiny new vehicle.  If more people would just stop thinking they can't do without this or that, and deal with the hand they're dealt, things would get better.

What that means is if you made $60,000 and you paid $9,000, then you only pay taxes on $51,000.  Thus of you are in the 28% tax bracket, you've reduced your taxes from $16,800 to 14,280.

OacSIfSiaa	Well the first part of this answer is that obtaining a credit card will lower his score as the application process will place a hard inquiry on his credit report.  It will then take a few years to have this inquiry dropped from his credit report. (Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C. § 1681c]<br>  <br>  Second, he will have to make sure he never misses a payment, never goes over his credit limit and does not charge anymore then 30% of his available credit line. ($1000 credit limit = $300 maximum to charge on the card)  You can use more now and then, but be sure to pay it back down to under 30% quickly.<br>  <br>  He might consider a secured credit card.  Save some cash and deposit it into a bank or credit union savings account, then apply for a credit card using the savings account as collateral.  The more you save the more your credit limit.  This is the quickest and easiest way to get a credit card.<br>  <br>  Or you can as the other person stated, apply for a major gasoline credit card as they are fairly easy.  Store credit cards will work as long as it is a major retailer (forget those clothing stores).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.|`|rKaUdhLUaa	It's better to have a Visa or MC. They are bigger company's and you can use their cards in more places. Also if you get a department card store and cancel it later, your credit will drop, with all of the companies going out of buisness right now I don't think it would be a good choice. Go with a card you will have for life and NEVER cancel a credit card, it practically deletes all possitive (of course they only look at negative, bastards ; ) credit history for that card and if it's your only card there goes everything you worked to build. If you get a standard or secured visa now, you can upgrade to a points card or any other card later to keep your history.|`|DPMsgxHMaa	When clients have been in the same situation, I suggest that they get a GAS credit card and then use it when they fill their vehicle up with gas.  Then they should put the cash they would have ordinarily used to pay for the gas aside so that there are no surprises when the bill comes.  This would accomplish two purposes:  it would get him the credit card he wants and he could pay at the pump! :)  Seriously, the credit card would have regular transactions on it, and if he keeps to the plan of setting the money aside and paying the entire bill off every month, he will be on his way to a higher credit score and establishing credit.<br>  <br>  I would not suggest a department store or Home Depot as he might be more tempted to make "impulse" purchases and that is the way people get in over their heads.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	It is pretty standard advice, particularly for those who are not far from looking at something like a mortgage or car loan and who have no previous credit history.  Credit cards are provided initially with relatively low credit limits to people who have no track record. It isn't a matter of simply acquiring a credit card, it is a matter of using one in a responsible manner - making payments when or preferably a little before you should. If you make payments before the credit-free period expires that builds points very quickly. It show an ability to manage finances properly.<br>  <br>  By the way, having a credit check done does NOT negatively affect your score. Having one done and subsequently being rejected by the potential lender does particularly if it relates to "Card Shopping", having a card that is in the red or that has a bad payment history and trying to get a new one. If it is your first card it is simply a part of the process - an obvious part.<br>  <br>  Strangely, once you have a credit card with a good history you will become bombarded with offers from other credit card providers and banks. I average one unsolicited offer per month, often labeled as "Pre-Approved"|`|AA10491661	bad advice, fire your financial counselor. You don't need a credit card to build credit.

The last place you want to see idiots roaming free is on the flight deck, but there they were, under my supervision, bopping about like mentally challenged baby ducks.

Bw1h5xAcaa	Well, I am an RN so obviously I'm a bit biased. ;)<br>  <br>  But here is why I would choose RN over dental hygiene. . . greater diversity in job settings, clinical specialties, flexible schedules, career advancement, educational advancement, and job security. You will always have a job as a nurse. If you find yourself in a job or specialty that you don't like, there are hundreds of other completely different jobs you could try until you find your niche. Dental hygiene is a one-track career. You're in people's mouths everyday and that's it, nothing else. You can work in a dental office, not really anywhere else. If you're a nurse, you could work in a hospital, a clinic, a school, a nursing home, in public health for a government agency, for insurance companies, doing home health, etc. You could work with old people, adults, children, infants, etc. You could become a travel nurse and take assignments all over the country or even the world. And personally, I think providing nursing care to people is very spiritually satisfying for me. I feel how my work impacts the lives of others, and I am not so sure I would feel that way about cleaning people's teeth and teaching them about mouth hygiene. Not that it's not important, but I don't feel like it touches a person's life in the same way. I like to feel that I am making a difference. I like hearing my patients tell me I have helped them. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!|`|c9dd01e506107f6af27f98631c59c641aa	Nursing is a great field and as long as you are not working in a hospital, nights and weekends are not an issue.  Dentists are GREAT to work for and the money is comparable, if not better to that of an RN, and the hours can not be beat!  One other option to consider is Health Information Management.  You can get a 2 year degree in this field, just make sure you are in a program that is accredited by AHIMA, and that will allow you to sit for an exam so that you can get your credential.  The money is great, the possibilities are endless and its one of the best kept secrets as far as jobs in health care goes.

DnNkCF6Taa	I would say get in contact with debt management companies.  Some of them can actually lower the interest rates and help you be able to pay back your credit cards and personal debt easier.   In the United States we have an organization called the Better Business Bureau to find out if a business is legitimate or not.  I would say see if India has one and then see what debt reducing companies are legit and take it from there.  I don't know what is the worst that can happen, but it is possible they can seize your assets, if you own a house or a car to pay off your debt.|`|2DRxmc6Daa	Hi friend, first stop to bothering about this.

Depending on your tax status (single, married) one can expect to net approximately 78% of your gross pay (e.g. $375.00-$450.00 weekly).<br>  <br>  An easy way to figure out your hourly rate is to divide the total salary by 2080--the number of work hours each year.|`|cGlU024Uaa	$500-$600 weekly

Then the Euro was worth about 68 pence sterling, but as it has strengthened a lot, and with sterling weakening, it is worth 89 pence now, or for every pound you have, it is worth €1.11.<br>  Unless the Euro crashes, or there is a sudden upturn in the UK, I think this value will stay, for a while at least.|`|uBtWPy7Gaa	You would get more pounds for your Euros now than when it was 1.50.  before you would have to part with €1.50 to get 1 pound.

5Gxll9Hkaa	That is not correct.  Anyone with any amount of income or assets is able to file Ch 7 provided that (post-2005 Bankruptcy Reform) (a) their income is below the median for their state, OR (b) they are able to rebut the "presumption of abuse" that arises if their income is above the median.<br>  <br>  There are many ways of rebutting the presumption of abuse. For example an extremely common one would be if your income was several thousand dollars above the median but you have a chronic medical condition that costs you tens of thousands of dollars/year in out of pocket expenses.<br>  <br>  So, while it is commonly cited as a "shorthand" Rule of Thumb that your income must be below the median in your state for your household size (which - who knows - may be $77,000 in your state) to be eligible to file Ch 7, that is really just a very crude Rule of Thumb with many possible exceptions.

Since you are double majoring and have a minor, most likely you will have enough credits to obtian your CPA license. If you choose to work for a Big 4 accounting firm you will be working long hours.

Better for most landlords to get some rent than no rent or just ask to be let out of the rental agreement or lease and move in with family or find a cheaper place. As a landlord  I'd rather release a tenant from a lease vs. having to spend a whole lot of time, effort, and attorney fees and have the tenant stay in the property not paying any rent for one to three months.

The joints shift a fraction of an inch and you might hear it.<br>  <br>  On the complicated side you could have electrical problems and the cracks are electricity arching.   You could have some structural damage to the roof too, but those cracking noises are not only loud, but you should be able to see it from the attic space.    This could also be foundation (bad news here), the ground under the house is either literally shifting or was not compacted properly and grows and shrinks with the weather, this will literally cause visible cracks in the interior and exterior walls.|`|dvgj6q6xaa	Sounds like you need to hire a structural engineer to check out the integrity of the building.

lkMRARZlaa	Purchase of equipment should not involve the income statement. <br>  <br>  You're purchasing an asset. So, if the equipment was paid for by cash, it would be debit the equipment (as you said, non-current assets on the balance sheet) and you'd credit the cash or bank account. Another way of doing it is to record a payable for purchase of the equipment. So, instead of credit the bank/cash account, credit accounts payable (so current liabilities). Hope that helps you out.

Some money is better than no money|`|kIblsxJQaa	I am in UK and repossessions (foreclosure) by the Banks/Buiding Societies is rising daily.  Its disgusting.  They cant do anything with the properties they are taking back as the housing market is so flat and families are being made homeless.  The Government should be doing so much more.  I think that reposession should be halted until things start to get much much better.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	Nothing. If people aren't paying their bills they are going to be foreclosed on, simple as that.|`|AA11357056	Yes, they are. If they didn't, that'd make even more people less willing to stay current with their mortgages. I'm not saying that the banks aren't to blame for a lot of the situation... but the people who borrowed are equally at fault. I'm not counting situations where someone's lack of ability to pay is due to them losing their job or if it's a health issue - I do think that the banks should try to work with them. But for others who just got loans that they really couldn't afford... well, too bad.|`|9cpKYneZaa	Yes, yes they are! And they're driving real estate values into the basement.<br>  <br>  Here's what you can do.<br>  <br>  First of all, think of the worst offenders. That is the banks that are responsible for the largest number of foreclosures in the area.<br>  <br>  Then, hire a really good lawyer to represent all of the borrowers who got screwed with really stupid sub-prime loans.<br>  <br>  Third, sue the banks for predatory lending practices (some jurisdictions allow this and some don't).<br>  <br>  Then finally, when those banks are so broke they can't even pay damages, then their officials will come to realize its easier to work with the borrowers than to own empty properties, pay for taxes, maintenance and insurance on those properties and get back far less than what the properties were worth much less what was owed on them.<br>  <br>  And of course, in the process torture some high level scumbags.<br>  <br>  Now normally I would be a good conservative and argue that businesses deserve to be protected in an economic downturn because lawsuits usually end up in unemployment and such and make banks reluctant to loan money in the future. But under these circumstances considering that the banks caused this mess, not in whole measure, just in large measure -- well you reap what you sow.<br>  <br>  They were greedy and mean-spirited so they deserve a good lesson in hard, cold facts. Don't play with homeowners. Treat them well and you'll make some money but not a killing.<br>  <br>  They tried to make a killing so its only fair that they get killed with lawsuits and expenses.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Some have instituted moratoriums on foreclosures but most have not and continue to foreclose.  We can press our representatives in the House and our senators to get on board with the president's bill to assist homeowners in trouble.  On an individual basis, demanding production of the original mortgage documentation slows the process to a crawl right now.  Eventually,the bank will find it and the action will go forward but it may slow the case down long enough for the legislation to pass and afford some assistance.|`|mM5FwiTEaa	Yes, they are... all we can do is hope that business gets better, then companies will stop firing people and instead start hiring people. Which in turn will start driving stocks up and people in America will be making money again, instead of losing it.|`|nMYHquMKaa	Defintion of economical:<br>  avoiding waste or extravagance; thrifty: an economical meal; an economical use of interior space. <br>  I do not understand the question. If I think you are asking why the banks are foreclosing people given the current economic situations - the answer is yes. Would you rather punish the banks for working hard and making something of themselves (the American dream) or punish the people who refinanced 4-5 times to buy a boat and are now in over their heads. Make them pay rent for awhile. (I know their are some legit cases where people lost their jobs and it was out of their control, but why should everyone else pick the tab up?)|`|OhYE3GhKaa	I heard on the news that they were having a moratorium on foreclosures but it was only until some time in March.<br>  <br>  i don't want to give you the wrong information but with the way things change so quickly it is hard to know.|`|1WQTxqUmaa	yes banks are foreclosing homes.  if they don't and these people aren't paying bills, the banks will eventually have to go bankrupt if they don't foreclose homes.|`|dvgj6q6xaa	Of course they are.

The federal government uses self-employment tax to fund Social Security and Medicare benefits. You must pay this tax if you have more than a minimal amount of self-employment income. If you file a Schedule C as a sole proprietor, independent contractor, or statutory nonemployee, the net profit listed on your Schedule C (or Schedule C-EZ) is self-employment income and must be included on Schedule SE, which is filed with your federal Form 1040.

Pjm9pg7iaa	No one predicted the Atlanta boom of 2004.  No one predicted the Atlanta bust of 2008.  <br>  I think that your target of buying a house in December 2009 should be a good plan. Prices are dropping but you don't want to wait to see if interest rates go up.<br>  First time buyers get the same deal as experienced buyers. It all depends on your down payment. Big down payments get the best loans. Small down payments get the worst loans..
Pjm9pg7iaa	Each person is buying something.  The car producers are buying the "placement" which puts their cars in the hands of movie stars in exciting situations.

If they buy an unknown band, it might be a big success and they save money. But it might be a big failure and they will wish that they hired a major band..

2PDBxlYDaa	I think that in life you often have to be your own best friend. Don't trust blindly. Let people earn trust and then trust them. But you have to also earn their trust in return. Overtime through experiences even bad ones, we learn how to be a better judge of character. I think that its your manager, ask to transfer elsewhere or seek a better job.<br>  <br>  Sure you're insecure, but look I have insecurities too and so do lots of people. You're not the only one hon. Never ever tell anyone at work that you are seeking therapy. Ever. Its not a weakness but in the workplace its seen as a weakness. I don't care if you're best friends with someone at work, some things should never be talked about.<br>  <br>  Quietly look for a new job. When you go to interview for a new job, its not just an opportunity for you to be interviewed but for you to interview them. You need to ask questions. Talk to the receptionist and other people there, basically scope out the place  as much as you can without coming across as a stalker and see if its somewhere that you want to work for the long-term.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Btw, don't try too hard hon. Take your time getting to know people, sometimes when you try too hard to be liked its a turn off. Ah okay, then about the therapy wow panic attacks, I have them sometimes because of social anxiety, they suck. I don't know what to tell you except keep going to therapy and hope that things improve. :-)
qXvFsnOcaa	China doesn't want hard currency, treasury bonds are more secure as they are government backed, and they can be transfered digitally.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine how much printed money would be needed? We're talking super tankers full.<br>  <br>  You can't simply print more money. If you print more money what happens is that the value of the money in existence decreases. You could double the amount of money in circulation simply by creating more digitally or via the printing press but this will devalue the money that you already have, meaning that you won't be able to pay people off with it because they will need twice as much as before.<br>  <br>  Germany tried printing money like this after WWI, and by the time that they'd finished it cost something like a billion of Germany's equivalent of the dollar to buy a loaf of bread, people had to go to the store with a barrow full of money.
hXk1JGj2aa	PA state laws prohibit you from doing any interior firefighting until you are 18 along with using any hydraulic rescue tools. You can however do exterior firefighting and assist at rescues or just basically be a extra hand on incidents to run tools and equipment around all under the supervision of an officer. My best advice is just be patient and do all those small tasks and watch and learn everything you can so that when you come of age you know what you are doing. The more you learn now the better and safer you'll be later. I remember doing things that I wasn't "legally" allowed to do ie; respond after hours, practice with hydraulics, runing equipt. inside of structures, sometimes I'd catch **** sometimes not. Just remember that if you get hurt It will be your officers *** on the line as they are the ones that are supposed to be watching you but as we all know fire scenes are busy places and officers have a lot to deal with so it is also your responsibility to know your place and limitations.

AA10305589	Take your anger out on the appropriate party - the bank did not charge you, the music site is the one in the wrong for using your card and pin number, so your fight is with them. You need to get them to reverse the charges, and the bank will cmake the funds available.  Additionally, I suspect you made the error  in your online bill payment, as the bank has nothing to gain by misdirecting your payments, and they would need to do such a thing on purpose.  Again, talk to the companies you deal with directly, and have them reverse the charge if possible, the bank's ability to correct your mistakes is limited, and you are ultimately the one in control of your funds.  Of course, if you are dissatisfied with the service at your bank, withdraw your funds and go to a new bank, you may get more satisfaction.

Usually they have to have a major card company on them. I believe most big chain stores only sell larger companies like Visa or Mastercard.

It brings them revenue, so they can pay you. I would stay and possibly see if YouTube pays you since they are becoming popular.<br>  <br>  Also you will lose some viewers because they want the ease of simply going to YouTube, not having to go to a different site just to view the videos.<br>  <br>  This could turn out to be a costly project, but its your videos.<br>  <br>  Try this host they are great if you decide to start a site.

Always keep in mind that a home will need upkeep, so don't stretch yourself too thin. You may need to repair something which gets expensive very quickly...

More so the general rule of thumb is that the monthly payments not be more than 25% to 30% of your gross monthly pay.<br>  <br>  Much of it should also be based on your life style. Only you can determine that. But don't make the mistake of getting what the mortgage company tells you what you can get. When I bought my first house they were trying to sell me a 200K house when I knew in fact I could only afford a 120K house. That's a lot of what happened with the housing crisis. Many were going for the maximum, not taking into account that they might like to eat, have furniture to put in the house and have electricity and water.<br>  <br>  You have to be realistic.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	500,000 divided by 2.5 = 200,000.

So we had $20,000 down on the house and paid points got bond money all equaling $79,000 with an FHA mortgage 4.9% rate. They approved us 3 years ago making $20,000. Like I said they bent the rules. Of course we did have a large down payment.|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Figure on spending no more than 30% of your gross income on housing.

If you are looking at the morality of switching immediately, I would not take that too seriously. There are certain realities in business!!  People pay 'lip service' to things such as loyalty and morality, but when you get down to it. Money is the driver for everything.  People with years of business experience understand this.

3mAgM405aa	The most effective way to advertise on the Internet is<br>  to first set up a website and publish its domain name<br>  on major search directories such as Google.com,<br>  Yahoo.com [at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?......" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?......</a> and<br>  MSN.com since 85% of Internet shoppers rely on these<br>  search directories to provide them with goods and<br>  services. In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yyZeOAONaa	I use traffic swarm to send traffic to my site.

77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	Where was the DON or ADON during all this? He/she would have been the right person for your supervisor to call (I assume that is a charge nurse), not the administrator.<br>  You should have had scheduled breaks-- by law. They must allow one half-hour break for a meal, and two 15-minute breaks per shift.<br>  I would go directly to the DON. She/he is your supervisor's boss and actually has the power to fix the problem after hearing your side of the story.<br>  In the meantime, do your charting within view of the nurse's station so your supervisor can see you aren't slacking. If a patient hits you, file an incident report. You really have to cover your ***.<br>  The best part of the termination?

OhYE3GhKaa	what does the brother think? It is interesting. but one thing, don't rely on other people's advice You guys need to sit down, and discuss it. I don't think two to a room have the same advantage as one to a room. and the brother probably has girls coming over. Do they pay a fee if they spend the night.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think 50/50 on the rent is fair, utilities split three ways, chores split three ways unless one of you wants to negotiate for another to do their chore. Like if you are the best cook, on someone else's week you can cook for them if they do something that you are supposed to do.<br>  <br>  success in this endeavor will rely on good communication. <br>  <br>  If it is a house, there probably is room for you to get away from each other if you need to. Actually, what would probably be good would be for you to have your own room. then you could split everything into 3. Plus it would be good for you to have your own space, doesn't have anything to do with love and togetherness.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Two roosters and one hen in the same chicken house spells a ruckus on the farm.<br>  <br>  But, I suggest dividing your rent and utilities expenses by 3.<br>  <br>  And each chicken provides their own feed and water.|`|U3jZFawtaa	Think of it this way. If just you and your boyfriend moved in you would split everything right? Then when a 3rd (brother) comes in you would charge them the going rate for a room and make them pay for their share of the expenses. It will probably add up to 3rds across the board but its another way to look at it and not feel like you are getting less when in fact you are getting more. More? yep. This arrangement has the understanding that you and your boyfriend can live together and if he got a live in then everything would be rearranged in 4ths ....not her paying him for half of his 3rd. Make sense?<br>  <br>  I would arrange it that anyone in the house helps divide the expenses across the board then later on you are covered. <br>  <br>  I don't see you are not getting less you are getting more and 1/3 is the right amount. Good Luck|`|AA10045620	I would split everything three ways.  Your choice to sleep in the brother's room.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	So if you had a 3 bedroom and you chose to sleep in the same room as your boyfriend, you think you should get a break from rent? <br>  <br>  It should be split 3 ways.  Your utilities will be split 3 ways, so resnt should be the same way. <br>  <br>  You sharing a room with your boyfriend and your boyfriend's brother having to deal with the inconvenience of sharing the apt. with another person is a wash.

There are rules for who can claim exempt on a W-4 and if you violate those rules, you get fined $500 plus under withholding penalties.<br>  <br>  You can properly fill out your W-4 to have the correct amount withheld, so you would have minimal refund or owe a small amount of tax (under withholding penalty may apply if you owe more than $1000 at filing time).|`|A1kiUMgvaa	You can claim exempt on your W-4 form.

It really doesnt matter as long as you put in the 'pay to' the correct name of the payee or the gas company in your case.<br>  <br>  Also companies usually require you to write somewhere in the check the account number of your gas bill.<br>  <br>  I think you are being responsible and have a kind heart if you plan to do this.|`|cii9XShcaa	They don't care who's name is on the check, just as long as they get their money.

Why is he living on his own if he can't afford it? Stop playing house. And if you pay it this time, then he'll have an excuse as to why he can't pay it next month.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, yes, you can pay with a check with your name on it. I could pay his bill with my name on it. The gas company just wants their money.|`|d21b8a886cea9e7687d2a1f509f75f80aa	Don't do it!!! No matter what the circumstances are!

m3WsXGL4aa	H&R Block, I think, has been around longer. However, I went to them on two separate occasions and they messed up BOTH times so I just do them myself. I tried Liberty Tax online and found their service to file the Federal tax easy and we got our return within a couple of weeks. Their online filing service for the state tax was also cheaper than others we looked at. Doing it yourself online is easiest and the cheapest way to go. Most services online file the federal for free and charge you only for the state. Try both their websites and see which one is best for you.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	It's like the difference between McDonalds and Jack in the Box|`|pJR1tRu1aa	I have not used Liberty Tax; only seen their hired Liberty men at the block corners, so really not sure what their service is like.<br>  <br>  I have used H&R Block a few years ago and they are a NO NO. They filed double income for me and messed up my taxes with stock trades as well. So in the end where I was supposed to get a refund, they showed that I owed Fed and State thousands of dollars.<br>  <br>  I had to hire an independant CPA with exhorbidant prices to fix my case.<br>  <br>  Surely enough have not been to H&R Block ever since then.<br>  <br>  Fai!
Pjm9pg7iaa	Most states require that septic tanks be pumped for every realty sale. Was yours pumped.  Do you have any access to a public sewer. Go to the agent's broker and explain your situation. A warning by a neighbor is not to be taken lightly by a person who is a professional. At the very least it would be a huge red flag. Neighbors are a wonderful source of information on a property.<br>  Go over any Disclosure papers you received from the seller. Also notify the Dept of Real Estate if the broker is not helpful..|`|AA11215123	You MIGHT have a case, but I don't believe it is incumbant on an agent to reveal unsubstantiated rumors from neighbors. Didn't your inspector check the status of the tank? With so many potential problems with septic tanks didn't you ask direct questions?
e1jgTlEMaa	Communication is important.  If you get an offer from the first employer, tell them that you're in consideration for another job and request time to make a decision.<br>  <br>  Similarly, once you have an offer, tell the other employer that you've got an offer, but indicate that you are strongly interested in their position.  Ask if any consideration can be made for a more timely decision.  If you are a good candidate, they employer will hopefully respond to the situation and give you an indication.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

ZeDjn4cVaa	Yes, you list the $260 (or whatever amount is shown on the 1099-B as having been paid to you) that you received from the EPP on schedule D as proceeds from sale of your former company's stock.  You most likely have a cost basis of the stock because the shares were purchased through payroll deduction.  If you look at your original paystubs, you may be able to see how much they deducted from your paycheck to purchase the company shares.  <br>  <br>  Or since the amount is so small, you can list the cost basis as zero and pay tax on the full amount received.  This results in more tax than you should have to pay because you did not receive the stock for free, but will not be challenged by the IRS.<br>  <br>  Richard K<br>  <br>  This advice is based my understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts provided by you.

Ch9TedMcaa	Why not through your work? More than likely, your employer is going to match your contributions at least 50%.|`|aCDWwsisaa	You can't.  The 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored entity.<br>  <br>  You CAN open your own IRA*, however, and right now would be a VERY smart time to do so, since even the best stocks have been beaten up.  To avoid the dangers of "picking the wrong stocks", your best move would probably be to buy a 'Growth stock mutual fund', you can learn all you need to know here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fool.com/retirement/ira/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.fool.com/retirement/ira/index...</a>|`|s5JiNpWDaa	First off, does your company offer a 401k plan??  You do not pick the 401k company, your employer does.  You do get to pick the funds.  If you are a long term investor 10+ years, now is an excellent time to start a 401k.  <br>  If your company does not offer a 401k, you can start an IRA on your own.  Vanguard, Fidelity or TRowe Price, are excellent places to do this.|`|N9VWMIFxaa	My advice would be not to do so.  The economy is a sham and many are losing this.  A 401K is a way of playing at a casino without leaving your home.<br>  <br>  Short the TBills is your best gambling bet right now as this is the next bubble on this economic collapse that is coming.  <br>  A better bet is to get out of the USA dollar and put your money into real assets for when the dollar collapses and the black market of the barter system comes into play you can have assets like food and gold and silver, drugs, alcohol that people will want<br>  <br>  Peace
FA1l64EOaa	A self-insured entity typically covers most of or all of its own insurance risks.  If Blue Cross / Blue Shield manages your insurance, but your company is self-insured, it sounds as if BC/BS is simply managing your claims and acting as a TPA (third party administrator).  A TPA strictly manages the claims for self-insured entities.  Since your company probably does not have any in-house insurance adjusters, this arrangement with BC/BS is entirely feasible.  That being said, all is well!  If you have any medical problems or work comp etc, your company will be taking care of your needs through a TPA.  Hope this helps.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	It means your company is gambling that they save money by paying all expenses themselves (plus a fee to BCBS to manage it) rather than paying for insurance premiums up front.  IF the employees stay healthy, they win.<br>  <br>  The downside for you as an employee is that the company can unilaterally change your coverage and decide, no, they aren't going to pay for a particular procedure anymore.  If you happen to need that procedure, you can't sue them to get it.  And, by then, it's too late to go buy a personal policy since you will be uninsurable by the time you realize you need the insurance.<br>  <br>  This has been a real problem over the years.  Companies will blithely list that you have a $1,000,000 cap on lifetime expenses.  Then somebody gets cancer or AIDS or want fertility treatments and their expenses go up.  The cap will suddenly become $50,000 and the company will say, sorry, no more money for you.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	As the first poster said, the Company is retaining most (or perhaps all) of the financial exposures associated with medical claims.  This is very common amongst the largest corporations.<br>  <br>  BCBS is functioning as the claims administrator on behalf of the Company.<br>  <br>  Don't fret it.  It's normal, and it's a good thing for you.|`|FGX5R5weaa	What self insured means is they hold the risk, because they pool the premiums and pay the claims. If the amount of claims is less than what they have gathered for premiums they make money, if it is less they lose money. BC/BS will administer the benefits (process claims, handle a provider network, etc). A self insured company is not bound to state health insurance laws, but is bound to federal. So for example, the state of MN says that all fully insured company's must cover a wig for someone with alopecia areata, as a self insured company they can ignore that. <br>  <br>  A self insured company gets to essentially make their own rules, once they sign off on their benefits however they cant suddenly say they aren't going to pay for something because they don't want to. The benefits will determine what is eligible and what is not.
38c303a5bdc786d68c71014c678b49faaa	dz is clueless. Neither the first or second lender HAVE to do anything.  If you refi to put them together you still have to qualify for the new loan.  The modification program does NOTHING for 2nd liens. <br>  <br>  The Govt plan is a lot of hot air.  No lender is required to do anything.  Nobody is getting a 2% 30 Fixed loan. Its not happening people.  In most cases they are extending the term on the loans.  Any reduction in rate is temporary.  5 years at most.  If you qualify for a refi your better off refinancing for a low rate that wont expire.  <br>  <br>  Zeuz is correct its a lot of smoke and mirrors.|`|mQK1Jrc6aa	NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Mortgage modifications have a bad rap, yet President Obama is depending on them to stop the foreclosure crisis.<br>  <br>  Modifications continue to be pushed as the best way to get struggling borrowers back on their feet. The jury is out on whether modifications work long-term. One recent study showed about half of borrowers with modified loans fell behind within six months.<br>  <br>  Still, Obama is giving modifications a central role in his $75 billion foreclosure prevention program.<br>  <br>  The program, which starts on Wednesday, calls for loan servicers to lower struggling borrowers' interest rates so that total payments are no more than 31% of their gross income. The government will subsidize part of the reduction, as well as kick in incentives for the servicers, borrowers and mortgage investors to participate in the modifications. <br>  <br>  for more about loan modification you can try here : <a href="http://www.iloanshop.com/loan_modification_stop_foreclosure.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iloanshop.com/loan_modificati...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck.......!|`|bVHnNqzBaa	No help for second mortgages.|`|HvFIHu3saa	dont listen to zeuz he is talking out his ***, i just modified my mortg and i am saving $400 per month, as for you the only thing you can do is refi they wont modify your second mortg but if you refi you can get a lower rate then what you are paying now.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Sorry to tell you this, but Obama is an empty shirt.

EecdTkxHaa	No. Once you submit that you actually will pay for it if you win, you're obliged to pay for it. <br>  There are ways to get around it, however. If you win, you could try contacting the seller or just not pay for it. Depending on the seller, you might get negative feedback.|`|Ksbf5OUQaa	You can only retract a bid if you've made a mistake ie: entered ￡90 instead of ￡9,  you may be able to sweet talk the seller and ask them to cancel your bid but you will need a genuine reason.  Sellers can only see you address if you win the item. and finally.... when you get negative feedback you get a red strike and a neg comment on your feedback page so that anyone can see it, plus your feedback score goes down, if you have 100% it might go dow to 99.8% but this is depending on how long you have been with ebay and what feedback you've got already.|`|uJDCoXH9aa	Nooooooooooooooooo.<br>  <br>  They cant see your address or contact details, no.<br>  <br>  But if you win the item and choose not to pay, e-bay can take action against you.<br>  <br>  If you email the seller now and explain the situation (Lie if you have to) they may let you off.

Fix term tenancies still require that either party give notice.|`|AA11215123	It seems clear in the wording you quote. You are reading an interpretation into it that is not there.

The law is very clear on this in every place I've ever lived ... if it's 'in writing' in your lease that you must give two months notice before you vacate the apartment and this includes a time that goes beyond the lease, then you must give that notice.  It's the written lease that takes precedent over the 'law' when this happens ... so pay up even if you want to move out sooner, because if you don't, you could be found 'in arrears' and be asked to pay not just that extra month rent, but court fees and lawyer fees if you are sued.  Sorry ... that's just the way it is in landlord-tenant cases.|`|XAAF7R23aa	i think it would depend on whether it is clear in the contract that the clause only applied to the 6 month half way termination.Could i suggest you show it to someone from the citizens advice bureau if you live in britain, it is difficult to assess your position without seeing the whole contract.|`|L75kWYehaa	Lease quite clearly states 2 months notice either way - at month ten you should have given written notice to vacate.|`|08sclDACaa	even though your tenancy is ending in one month you still have to by housing laws give the full two months notice, likewise if the landlord wants you out after the tenancy had ended he would still have to give you the same 2 months. In a 12 month fixed tenancy to terminate the agreement you would have to do so at the 10 month period. The only other way to get out of the contract is if you came to a private arrangement that both parties agreed with. You can however leave the property but you will be liable for the rent remaining for the period of the notice given ie.2 months. i hope this has helped :)|`|AbzQpogcaa	I could give you my opinion but I'm not sure!

DAMZKbpDaa	The formula the IRS uses for community property states is, they divide the income, credits, and deductions in half for each spouse, by state law. After the tax obligation for the couple is met, she will get half of the refund. It could be $2250, or it could be something less (because of current 2008 tax obligations).|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	With a community property state the refund coming from withholding (and stimulus) is 50-50.<br>  <br>  EIC is not a state program, so it doesn't follow community property rules.  The IRS will allocate the EIC on the return based on the relative incomes of the two spouses (it's not prorated--given the numbers you gave, your wife might get $600 of the total EIC).|`|AA10469473	Since Nevada is a community property state, you will most likely get half of the refund, and the other half will be taken toward what you owe.|`|6ac4369b32aa25760933d15c6ca06c44aa	I HAVE TO FILE INJURED SPOUSE AND IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET IT BACK  ANY WHERE FROM 8 TO 16 WEEKS.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	it takes 11-14 weeks to process the injured spouse form and to get a refund.the EIC will be calculated by the irs based on each of you own income and your wife should have claimed the child on the injured spouse form in the space listed as injured spouse.nobody can tell you exactly how much your wife will get back because that will be calculated by the irs when they run the numbers.

They can't expect you to work every single day. That's illegal.<br>  You are working too much and getting taken advantage of.|`|bJqS9GYOaa	You do not say if your pay is supposed to be salary or hourly.   In the US employers are required to pay minimum wage.  Anything over 40 hours a week they are required to pay at least time and half.   But this only applies to employees paid hourly.   I would recommend getting involved in a union to help protect your rights.
MmTe8W8uaa	A "return" is the document or electronic filing that you send to the government; the money that they send to you is called a "refund".<br>  <br>  To receive a refund, or receive a larger refund, or not owe, you claim a smaller number of allowances on your W-4.  However, this will also result in a smaller amount in your paycheck.  The total that you receive (both in paychecks and in refunds) minus anything you owe at the end of the year will be the same either way (unless you owe over $1000, in which case there is a penalty, or the refund is intercepted for another debt, such as unpaid child support).<br>  <br>  You can also leave your W-4 the way that it is, and simply hold onto some of the money from each paycheck, to use to pay the IRS and to use to pay bills at tax time.  When this money can be stored in a bank, that is the best option, because the bank would pay you interest.  However, if a bank is not an option, and you would have to store it at home, where it would not earn interest and might be stolen, then the best option is to have the money withheld from your pay and stored by the IRS for you.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	You could fill out your W-4 with single zero, for the IRS to keep more of your money over the year and you get more of it back at filing time.<br>  <br>  If you want the IRS to take even more money, you could ask for an additional sum above your withholding to be taken out. The IRS will happily hold the extra money for you; it is like an interest-free loan to them.<br>  <br>  But consider this: a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow (or at tax time). You might just put the money in a savings account and put in the extra money to that. In other words, pay yourself rather than the IRS.

According to the Fair Labor Standards Act, a tipped employee is not subject to minimum wage laws. It is assumed that the tips will bring the employee to at least minimum wage on an average hourly basis. IF you are not tipped, then the minimum wage law applies (Subway for example).  The key here is that the employer must tell you that you are in fact going to be a tipped employee.

vsFfUhgbaa	By meeting the challenges of availability, affordability, acceptability and awareness.<br>   Availability<br>  <br>  The first challenge is to ensure availability of the product or service. India's 627,000 villages are spread over 3.2 million sq km; 700 million Indians may live in rural areas, finding them is not easy. However, given the poor state of roads, it is an even greater challenge to regularly reach products to the far-flung villages. Any serious marketer must strive to reach at least 13,113 villages with a population of more than 5,000. Marketers must trade off the distribution cost with incremental market penetration. Over the years, India's largest MNC, Hindustan Lever, a subsidiary of Unilever, has built a strong distribution system, which helps its brands reach the interiors of the rural market. To service remote village, stockists use auto-rickshaws, bullock-carts and even boats in the backwaters of Kerela. Coca-Cola, which considers rural India as a future growth driver, has evolved a hub and spoke distribution model to reach the villages. To ensure full loads, the company depot supplies, twice a week, large distributors which who act as hubs. These distributors appoint and supply, once a week, smaller distributors in adjoining areas. LG Electronics defines all cities and towns other than the seven metros cities as rural and semi-urban market. To tap these unexplored country markets, LG has set up 45 area offices and 59 rural/remote area offices. <br>  <br>  Study on buying behaviour of rural consumer indicates that the rural retailers influences 35% of purchase occasions. Therefore sheer product availability can affect decision of brand choice, volumes and market share. Some of the FMCG giants like HLL took out project streamline to significantly enhance the control on the rural supply chain through a network of rural sub-stockists, who are based in the villages only. Apart from this to acquire further edge in distribution HLL started Project Shakti in partnership with Self Help groups of rural women. <br>  <br>  Affordability<br>  <br>  The second challenge is to ensure affordability of the product or service. With low disposable incomes, products need to be affordable to the rural consumer, most of whom are on daily wages. Some companies have addressed the affordability problem by introducing small unit packs. Godrej recently introduced three brands of Cinthol, Fair Glow and Godrej in 50-gm packs, priced at Rs 4-5 meant specifically for Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh - the so-called `Bimaru' States.<br>  <br>  Hindustan Lever, among the first MNCs to realise the potential of India's rural market, has launched a variant of its largest selling soap brand, Lifebuoy at Rs 2 for 50 gm. The move is mainly targeted at the rural market. Coca-Cola has addressed the affordability issue by introducing the returnable 200-ml glass bottle priced at Rs 5. The initiative has paid off: Eighty per cent of new drinkers now come from the rural markets. Coca-Cola has also introduced Sunfill, a powdered soft-drink concentrate. The instant and ready-to-mix Sunfill is available in a single-serve sachet of 25 gm priced at Rs 2 and multiserve sachet of 200 gm priced at Rs 15. <br>  <br>  Acceptability<br>  <br>  The third challenge is to gain acceptability for the product or service. Therefore, there is a need to offer products that suit the rural market. One company, which has reaped rich dividends by doing so, is LG Electronics. In 1998, it developed a customised TV for the rural market and christened it Sampoorna. It was a runway hit selling 100,000 sets in the very first year. Because of the lack of electricity and refrigerators in the rural areas, Coca-Cola provides low-cost ice-boxes - a tin box for new outlets and thermocol box for seasonal outlets. <br>  <br>  The insurance companies that have tailor-made products for the rural market have performed well. HDFC Standard LIFE topped private insurers by selling policies worth Rs 3.5 crore in total premia. The company tied up with non-governmental organisations and offered reasonably priced policies in the nature of group insurance covers. <br>  <br>  Awareness<br>  <br>  Mass media is able to reach only to 57% of the rural population. Creating awareness then, means utilizing targeted, unconventional media including ambient media .For generating awareness, events like fairs and festivals, Haats, etc., are used as occasions for brand communication. Cinema vans, shop-fronts, walls and wells are other media vehicles that have been utilized to increase brand and pack visibility. Ideas like putting stickers on the hand pumps, walls of the wells putting on tin plates on al the tree surrounding the pond are some of the innovative media used by personal wash like Lux and Lifebuoy and fabric wash items like Rin and Wheel. Idea was to advertise not only at the point of purchase but also at the time of consumption<br>  With large parts of rural India inaccessible to conventional advertising media - only 41 per cent rural households have access to T|`|SmPOWbD6aa	Seasonal vegetable, crops are always cheap.

8sMWFD5Maa	I really don't know about the SCAM nature of this business.<br>  HOWEVER, my take on the subject is that any business that pays its customers to advertise its product or service is at the very least borderline.   And I'll explain why:  The companies having an in-house paid full-time sales staff has a known quantity in that they hired the salespeople to be salespeople and the company has already interviewed said salespeople and they at least have a decent educated guess as to what their salespeople will be doing.<br>  <br>  The random customer of said business, may or may NOT be a trained salesperson and many times, UNTRAINED salespeople can do great damage to a companies good name by NOT presenting the product or service in a way that is either legal or ethical,  This could lead to all sorts of problems, but because of the way that the contracts are written, the business or corporation has covered their own tails very well, its the individual who takes the brunt of whatever trouble comes from improper promotion of the product.  NOT A GOOD IDEA!

zhmpxdOnaa	I think 4 months is too much.  Two weeks notice is usually the norm, but it all depends on your relationship with your company.  I think a month's notice is plenty of time, but 2 weeks is better IMO.  Something may come up or happen between now and when you're leaving the compnay.  Maybe the idea of going back to school will fall through - a lot could happen in 4 months. The cons of giving your resignation too soon is that you'll no longer be included in future projects, and you'll probably just get crap work till you leave.  Also, if you tip your hand too early, your boss could ask you to leave early if they find a decent replacement for you.|`|bJqS9GYOaa	I would say you could get laid off early.   If your office is cutting down on both the labor and work force,  you could be next.

Most places only ask for 2 weeks for this.|`|MwYrvnhaaa	Yesss, I think thats too early. If they need to replace you give them adequate time to find someone. They will understand about school.

RcAofGkIaa	Don't take this so personally.  Negotiation is game, some people play soft ball and some people play harder.  Ignore the "insult" comment, who cares?  The question is, what are you willing to pay for the house and can you find a better deal.  It is NOT a sellers market right now.  And frankly, your offer sounds reasonable.  If you can live without THIS house, RIGHT now, let him cool his jets while you continue looking.  Remember, you are negotiating, not dating, but there is no reason to get nasty either.|`|AA11215123	Maybe he is a patient man and simply willing to wait-out the market. It's his house and he doesn't have to reduce his price if he doesn't want to. Not everyone is a slave to media-hype about the desperation in the housing market. Don't let yourself get emotional about it. <br>  <br>  Your might want to counter-offer as you describe - "full price offer and tell him to put a new roof on" - if you are willing to accept it. If not, simply move on to the next property.|`|qYZkeB8maa	Don't pay more than you think the house is worth.  A new roof sounds expensive.

Out of touch or emotionally attached that it blinds reality of whats going on these days.<br>  <br>  Lets first go on the path that he is reasonable. What are the comps? It sounds like you are doing a party to party negotiation so what might help is to approach him with a package as to how you got where you are at. Show comps, maybe a zillow estimate (not accurate sometimes but throw it in there. Also get a list of foreclosures and NOD's (known as Notice of Defaults) in his area. What these things will do is show him the cold hard facts of what it is worth today but with properties around him shortly going to default and auction that the value of the home is getting smaller and smaller every week he waits. If he has allot of NOD's and current bank owned and short sale propeties then putting 2+2 together he is going to lose a chance to get what you offered because identical to his are about to hit the auction block as prices much less.<br>  <br>  Ask him "help me understand where you are at because as a buyer in a buyers market where I can pick up deals being a bonaide buyer ready to close....after looking at all I have shown you ....show me how YOU got to standing firm because if we cant compromise I will be buying an identical property for less and you may have stood firm on quicksand"<br>  <br>  Now lets look if he is unreasonable. Go the 163k and make sure the inspection accounts for things that an insurance audit might catch. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT. I bought a 4 plex and it went through inspection and the deal closed. Then my insurance company did a random audit and I was the lucky one and the roof did not pass so I had to spend money to fix it AFTER the deal had closed 3 weeks earlier.  Tell the inspector that you will come back to him if he does not report at the same standard as an insurance inspector would. <br>  <br>  If the deal doesnt work out then let him choke on it. Plenty of properties about to go to the auction block. Try Freddiemac Homesteps and find an agent or broker registered there to help you. You can track properties about to go and get a great deal that way too. Good Luck|`|38c303a5bdc786d68c71014c678b49faaa	There are so many homes out there, I'd send a counter offer at the same levels and say sorry if your insulted and then have your realtor start showing you other homes.|`|e7e43f919e18af8ff16bcd6a4f93d87aaa	His Loss move on or wait  a month then offer him 10k less.

I really don't think your offer was insulting at all. Considering it needs a new roof & you're willing to pay so much in closing costs, I would have found your offer VERY reasonable. After all, a new roof is going to cost you plenty. Go ahead & make your 2nd offer, maybe even lower it a bit and see what happens. If he rejects it I would walk away and look for something else. Every thing happens for a reason and that just means better things are in store for you! Good luck!

For example, I have $5000 and buy shares of a company worth $1 a share, then I will have 5,000 shares, following that the company goes up to $1.10 a share  then you take 5,000 shares X $1.10 and i've made $5,500 in one day minus the $5000 I initially put in, so you would make a profit of $500 that day but with short term trading you pay taxes up the roof, my suggestion is buying stock and holding it for some time then cashing out when you feel comfortable with your gain.

I am not saying that you should not buy a stock for $20, but generally stocks that are more expensive move slower than cheap stocks. If you buy a stock worth $2.45, it may jump up to $5 in a year.

The economy will recover. By the time you graduate the economy should be working better. Everything runs in cycles. Right now we are in a down cycle. Highs and lows never last. The economy is very fluid. Go with the area that you have the most interest. If you want to go into accounting then an accounting degree would serve you better. If you go that route then you really need to plan on getting your MA CC.

XpKY04Tnaa	I do this kind of IT work. First there is no training for this. These people are trained and experienced at what they do. Also they can work independently without supervision.

The seller breached the contract.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	I don't see how the seller being 2 days late on the disclosure is material, BUT if you can show that it's material to the contract, then "yes", you can pull out.<br>  <br>  For future reference, while you should agree to put down a reasonable downpayment (i.e., 3% to 5%, you should only designate a nominal portion of the downpayment as "earnest" -- like $75)|`|U3jZFawtaa	Actually it is material. If you dont meet deadlines it gives one party the option to cancel. Its set up like this so things don't drag and it keeps a sense of urgency. It should say in the paperwork that if time expires it may affect the contract. Your agent should be telling you that you can  get your money back. Hopefully its in escrow because its easier to get back that way. If somehow things are back on track and you still want to get out of it there are inspection and financing elements that you have control over that could get you out of the deal. Good Luck.|`|38c303a5bdc786d68c71014c678b49faaa	Yes you can back out and yes you can get your money back.  They may hesitate with ther refund.
