2kpr2arRaa	as an american who Loves british comedy I would say that many classic british comedies have  more "Catch phrases" than american ones<br>  <br>  "you stupid boy" "don't panic"  from Dad's Army<br>  <br>  "are you free?" 'water for mr Granger"  mrs slocombe's pussy jokes from Are you being Served<br>  <br>  are just a couple examples|`|7CsLJ4I8aa	Traditionally, British comedy is more dark and dry (some would say more "intelligent), whilst american comedy tends to be more slapstick or more things for "shock" value.

28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	I hope it ends his career. I have to say I am absolutely disgusted with this situation, and the lack of people in the entertainment industry that are standing up for Rihanna. I hear all sorts of celebrities saying 'we don't know what happened behind closed doors, yadayada' but the truth is, IT DOESN"T MATTER! Whether she provoked him or not, he shouldn't have beat her. Everytime I look at that picture of her after the beating, it makes me want to cry.<br>  <br>  I am a woman that was in a severely abusive relationship, so I really sympathize with her. There's a thing called 'battered wife syndrome' that happens to abused women. They tend to convince themselves that it was their fault that the man beat them. I remember once, my boyfriend was in jail for giving me a concussion and a fractured ankle, and I went to court and told them that I had lied about the whole thing to get him out. When he got home, instead of being greatful, he cut my body with razorblades, locked me in a room to bleed to death, and went to a bar. I had to break a window, crawl out of it, and walk to the hospital. I STILL got back with him after that because I believed that I had done something wrong. I didn't get out of that relationship until my family showed up and made me leave him, and move back to Virginia from California. Even then, I still spoke to him on the phone for about 6 months, and swore we would get back together.<br>  <br>  Rihanna will realize that this is wrong eventually, but right now she is in the trows of the relationship, and feels that she could never live without him. I truly hope that her family is there for her, and forces her out of the situation if necessary, and I hope that Chris Brown's career is over as a result.<br>  <br>  Time will tell, we can only hope, and support her while she is going through this.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	If he did all that to her, YES his career should come to a quick end.|`|dQEKlNAYaa	no he just ruined his career and rihanna's back together with him|`|DYUc85jBaa	Man..

HXW4i5Ajaa	Are you sure it is feedback? The description of the gadget sounds like an ebow
vDGFRACaaa	Probably not. Those are just publicity stunts to get people interested in the movie so they can rake in the sales. In the case of straight-to-DVD, spending money on publicity would be a waste because most people won't want to see the film, or already know about it.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	It's their option to do one. It all depends. If a movie from theaters comes too DVD to quick, obviously it meant it sucked & didn't make enough money.|`|hat60KYXaa	Sometimes.  When Futurama released each of its 4 direct-to-DVD movies, they had a reception and screening for everyone who worked on them.|`|pNY6xXb5aa	that depends, a lot of indie movies don't have the budget for a theatrical release worldwide but there's still a release party involved, and then there is the straight to DVD B quality movie, these guys don't bother about release parties or marketing, as long as someone buys or rents it they are happy.|`|AA10363258	yes, a lot of independent movies go straight to dvd but there can still be a release party.|`|3dzuYTC5aa	More than likely not.

ac3e5bd735bf1028d781d41c7422c7c4aa	Auf alle F?lle die gro?en Mozart-Opern, die besten Opern die je komponiert wurden:<br>  - Die Hochzeit des Figaro<br>  - Don Giovanni<br>  - Così fan tutte<br>  (Die Zauberfl?te mag ich pers?nlich nicht so, kann man aber auch zu seinen gro?en Opern z?hlen).<br>  <br>  Dann natürlich<br>  - Fidelio (Beethoven)<br>  - Der Freischütz (Weber)<br>  <br>  Ich bin kein gro?er Wagner-Fan, aber den Thannh?user sollte man vielleicht in die Liste mit aufnehmen. Und in zweiter Linie (also für Fortgeschrittene) den Ring des Nibelungen.<br>  <br>  Im italienischen Fach bin ich nicht so zu hause, aber von Verdi (Falstaff) und Puccini (La Bohème, Turandot) sollte man natürlich auch etwas kennen. Und Rossinis "Barbier von Sevilla".<br>  <br>  Bei den Franzosen wurde Carmen von Bizet schon genannt. Hoffmanns Erz?hlungen von Jacques Offenbach sollte man noch erg?nzen.<br>  <br>  Beim übergang zur Moderne halte ich Leos Janacek (z.B. Die Sache Makropoulos), Benjamin Britten (z.B. Billy Budd) und Dmitri Schostakowitsch (z.B. Lady Macbeth von Mzensk) für wichtige Komponisten. Die ganz modernen Komponisten heb dir mal für sp?ter auf.<br>  <br>  Die Operette kannst du getrost ganz auslassen. Oder h?r dir die Fledermaus an, das reicht, was besseres findest du nicht in dem Genre.<br>  <br>  PS: interessant, was hier alles so als Oper oder Operette gez?hlt wird.<br>  Der Nu?knacker ist ein Ballett; My Fair Lady, West Side Story und Das Phantom der Oper sind Musicals, Carmina Burana eine szenische Kantate.

74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	Here is one that was brought my attention from my x husband years ago, and he was right, and I still catch myself doing it... If someone is sitting down or standing somewhere, like at a picnic table, or couch, or line etc..  no matter how much room there is on one side of them, I will automatically go to the side with the least amount of room, and ask them to move down or over a bit.  Just last week, my daughter was on the couch, on the end, whole couch, yet I asked her to move over so I could sit down.. hahahaha she is like "what is wrong with the rest of the couch?".. I have no idea why I do this, but I do catch myself at it often.|`|3b7f981ec9322ae56fd97d48b88e75f0aa	I HATE the sound/act of filing nails.

000db28fb52ab31dee59ac037328db75aa	Pollmer legt das in seinem Buch "Prost Mahlzeit" noch ausführlicher dar. Es geht ihm um die Ausgewogenheit der Ern?hrung, und er r?umt mit einigen Mythen der gesunden und ungesunden Ern?hrung auf, alles ohne erhobenen Zeigefinger und fernab des üblichen Eso-Quarks.<br>  <br>  Er verteufelt das Fast Food nicht, ab und an eine Portion Pommes in Verbindung mit einer einigerma?en ausgewogenen Ern?hrung schadet nicht. Wir essen nur von allem zu viel: Zu fett, zu sü?, zu wenig ballaststoffreich. <br>  <br>  Au?erdem setzt sich Pollmer auch seit langem gegen die sinnlosen Di?ten ein, die einzig zum gefürchteten Jo-Jo Effekt führen und meistens nur den Geldbeutel strapazieren.|`|tMvWqGY4aa	Definitiv Eisbergsalat!!!<br>  <br>  Pommes Frites im Test<br>  <br>  Pommes geh?ren zu unseren Lieblingen an der Imbissbude. Fast 150.000 Tonnen verdrücken wir Deutschen jedes Jahr. Ein Drittel davon gehen bei McDonalds über die Ladentheke. Dabei sind die Pommes beim "goldenen M" gar nicht die besten. Das meint die Stiftung Warentest nach einer Untersuchung.<br>  <br>  Wie kann es sein, dass so viele Deutsche irren?<br>  Sabine Schütze: "Nein, natürlich haben die Pommes-Liebhaber, die sich ihre Kartoffelst?bchen bei Meckes holen nicht geirrt, zumindest nicht geschmacklich. Denn schmecken tun sie tats?chlich topp, lecker nach Kartoffeln und knusprig. ABER – und das schmecken wir nicht – die Pommes von McDonalds sind hoch  mit Acrylamid belastet; - und das obwohl der Konzern schon vor Jahren get?nt hat, genau das zu ?ndern. Und auch Transfetts?uren sind in diesen Pommes eindeutig zu viele. Das sind allerdings Probleme, die man nicht schmeckt." <br>  <br>  Mal ehrlich, ist das denn so schlimm? Schlie?lich essen wir ja nicht jeden Tag Pommes und dass die keine Ern?hrungsempfehlung sind, das wissen wir doch!<br>  Sabine Schütze: "Stimmt, aber gerade weil Pommes eben an sich schon nicht so gesund sind, weil viel zu viel Fett, sollten wir unbedingt zusehen, dass wir unsere Gesundheit damit nicht unn?tig mehr ruinieren. Denn schon eine kleine Portion Pommes bei Meckes bedeutet, wir haben unser Tageskonto an ungesunden Transfetts?uren bereits voll. Wenn wir bei Ikea Pommes essen, dann haben wir sogar das Fünffache dessen, was noch tolerierbar ist. Und das hei?t, wir mit einer solchen Mahlzeit unser Risiko für eine Herzerkrankung massiv erh?ht und unseren Cholesterinwert sowieso. In D?nemark etwa sind solche Mengen Transfetts?uren im Essen deswegen l?ngst gesetzlich verboten." <br>  <br>  Das letztere sagt ja schon mal alles!! :-)<br>  <br>  Dann essen die meisten Leute ja auch die Pommes nicht leer. :-)  Ketchup geht ja kalorienmaessig noch, aber Mayonaise macht das Ganze noch ungesuender!!<br>  <br>  Apropos Kalorien: Ketchup ist besser als Mayo zu Pommes. Denn Mayo hat rund sieben Mal so viel Kalorien wie Ketchup.  :-)|`|2a612225665dcc9750bbcf2909421a31aa	ungesund ist, wenn man st?ndig nur das isst, wovon andere sagen, dass es gesund ist. gesund ist, wenn man das isst, was schmeckt. eben in normalen mengen. fertig aus !!!|`|aa7f13a7c957f21e8c19de85d63c5ae9aa	Eine echte Marktlücke: Papiertaschentücher mit Vitamin C!|`|b59b66d1f82559a30ec1861df4dab7bbaa	hmmmm.... bei welcher nahrung fühlst du dich denn anschliessend besser, will meinen : was kann dein k?rper besser verdauen ???

Man sollte mindestens einmal im Monat - laut einer hollaendischen Studie - etwas Fettiges wie Pommes etc. essen. <br>  Ausserdem schuetzt das Fett die Darmschleimhaut und verringert das Darmkrebsrisiko. <br>  Ich wuerde dir raten anderes Gemuese - wie z.B. Karotten, Zuccini (geschmackssache, aber sehr gesund) oder Pastinaken - zu kaufen. Aber tu dir auch einen Gefallen und iss einmal im Monat Pommes!!! Du wirst schon nicht von einer Portion dick werden.<br>  <br>  LG, SummerGirl|`|TdlaEZtfaa	POMMES !!!  OHNE POMMES W?RN WIR DOCH AUFGESCHMISSEN.

Ballaststoffe und Zellulose sind für Deinen Darm sehr, sehr wichtg, um ihn zum einen zu reingen und zum anderen Schadstoffe auf dem Weg nach draussen mitzunehmen. <br>  Mit den Pommes frites ist das etwas anders. Sicherlich haben diese auch ihre N?hrstoffe, jedoch die Menge macht es hier und denke bitte dran welch ungesunden,teilweise schon verrauchten ?le Dein K?rper verarbeiten muss.<br>  <br>  Also diese Aussage war sicherlich auch nicht so gemeint: "Salat weg, Pommes her"|`|drDBjqlTaa	Pommes enthalten im viel Salz und Fett, das macht sie ungesund PUNKT

AA11112418	There are too many other variables beside money in this equation. What kind of music are you planning on performing with this mouthpiece? What kind of sound are you going for? I personally use a Lakey 7* for jazz and a Eugene Rousseau 4* (I think for the number, not sure off the top of my head) for classical. I use my Yamaha 52 for jazz and my old 1926 Conn for classical. You may not like that set up and want something else. If you have a saxophone already, go to your music store and try mouthpieces until you find one. If you don't have a saxophone, go try saxophones until you find one that you like and then go searching for mouthpieces. I've tried other players set ups and I hate the feel of it, and I know people get the same from mine. It is a very personal thing.|`|3b9edf84bca4ffa3db822b68161b0c6faa	it's a C*(star) and I believe it's made by Selmer. Very GOOD! I played one for a scholarship, and got it.

Angeblich wurden Sie ja vor 6000 Jahren erbaut. Mittlerweile hat man rund um den Globus Pyramiden gefunden und scheinbar auch auf dem Mars.<br>  <br>  Warum interessiert die Menschen das? Nun die Menschen von Damals waren zu Uns nicht so verschieden.

Wie r?tseln seit ca 2200 Jahren.<br>  Die ?lteste vollst?ndige überlieferung der Liste der Weltwunder findet sich in einem Epigramm des ph?nizischen Schriftstellers Antipatros von Sidon (2. Jahrhundert v. Chr.), der eine Art Reiseführer des Altertums schrieb. <br>  Die Cheops-Pyramide ist das ?lteste (entstand vor fast 5000 Jahren)und das einzige noch erhaltene Weltwunder. Wegen ihrer Gr??e wird sie auch die "Gro?e Pyramide" genannt, sie ist mit Ausnahme der chinesischen Mauer, das gr??te je von Menschen errichtete Bauwerk. Sie ist mit 146,6 m so hoch wie ein 50st?ckiger Wolkenkratzer und auf ihrer Grundfl?che von 230 x 230 m h?tten die fünf gr??ten Kirchen der Welt gleichzeitig Platz.<br>  3500 Jahre blieb das Innere von Menschen unberührt, bis der erste Grabr?uber Kalif Allah al-Ma'Mun in der Hoffnung auf Sch?tze die Pyramide betrat, doch sie war leer.<br>  Aufgrund von Wiederaufbauarbeiten in Kairo nach einem Brand (1168) fehlen heute die obersten Schichten der Pyramide (sie ist nur noch 137,20 m hoch) und die wei?en Kalksteinplatten.|`|b59b66d1f82559a30ec1861df4dab7bbaa	ja genau......warum überhaupt ?

e9wlXJgPaa	I was not a fan of The O.C., but I did see the finale as I was coerced into taping it for my roommate.  I personally thought the ending was decent, and my roommate (who loved the show) thought it was a good way to wrap up the series - it was the ending of one part of their lives and the beginning of the next.  TV shows have tendencies to leave things open-ended, unless everyone dies.  You probably don't want that, though.<br>  <br>  And it was cancelled because ratings kept going down throughout the second and third seasons, and only 16 episodes were ordered for the fourth.  Then the network passed on renewing it.<br>  <br>  And, no, they won't make new episodes (though I'm not sure if the CW will pick it up in syndication): Josh Schwartz, the creator of the show, reportedly said, "Yeah, this season will indeed be the last. There was some speculation about a Season 5 on another network but we are having a really fun, great run and I feel like better to go out now than stay too long at the party... and after 4 seasons of the OC, I know a lot about parties..."|`|PdwTcfZfaa	their ratings were dwindling towards the last episodes.|`|azfqfKDJaa	they took The O.C. off because it was too "fake".<br>  <br>  i'm not sure if they will have new episodes but I know i'm not gonna watch them.

2PTlXs9zaa	Just remove yourself. It isn't worth losing an account over in my opinion.<br>  Sometimes when an account has been inactive for a few days, they will attach themselves to your account so they can sort through your questions and answers and report. Sometimes, they just like your answers and want to be a contact. But I feel like they should ask first.|`|84ba2cd69c5b17cc2f05a3fe00e67ea9aa	I guess so.|`|vW7szpvNaa	Yeah, I'd block em'.

First off this person is from New Zealand, so live in a remote part of the world.  You don't know thier entire situation, if they eaisly have access to a computer.  Perhaps this person made an account a few years ago and has not had computer access for some time.  Perhaps he or she is just getting back into it or from time to time access the account.<br>  <br>  Points don't matter as 100 points is given automatically when the account is first created, plus 1 point for just logging in that day.  So they had to log in 26 times since then to accumulate 127 points.  Not to hard to believe.|`|n35FH2rLaa	Strange how they have been here since 2006, and they have 100 plus points... and they have not done anything to get them....

u97qfP4Maa	oh god how can someone like narnia better than harry potter?<br>  <br>  i mean i respect you liking narnia but i read the book and it just wasnt amazing<br>  where as harry potter has more depth and is far more intresting plus i think harry potter has a bigger fanbase than narnia. ive never met one person in my life that liked narnia but with harry potter ive met tons <br>  <br>  narnia is good i guess but i cant explain it... harry potter has this feeling about it when your reading its like youve been brought into a whole new world and you wish you were in it and it was real .<br>  alot of people seem to have read the narnia series and like it but have never even read  the whole series of harry potter and say harry potter sucks !<br>  <br>  i think if you ACTUALLY read harry potter and not just the first or second one but get more into the fourth and up, then you'll love it more than narnia and then you'll be laughing at questions like this like i am right now.<br>  <br>   i dont care what anyone says,<br>  harry potter is better than narnia any day. =)|`|AA10283080	Harry Potter<br>  <br>  As a kid I adored the Chronicles of Narnia but once Harry Potter showed up Narnia seemed a bit more childish.<br>  <br>  Although I do still love Narnia.|`|MlZay5VHaa	I prefer Harry Potter.

I've been hurt so many times that even on Facebook I have it so nobody can add me or look me up, I add people that I want as friends, and only my friends can see my profile. I also do not do what many people I know do on Facebook- add every person they have ever talked to for only one or two times or been in a class with a person that they don't even know that well. I have to be "good" friends with the person(I have to have talked to the person many times and feel that they are not two faced- they don't do what other people have done, which is be nice to your face then go behind your back and hurt you by spreading rumours or doing other things), or they have to be someone that is a part of my family, and even then I only add relatives that I know well and like. It is because of this that I don't have 100 or more friends on Facebook, I have a lot(50+), but not 100+, which like I said before, is what most people I know have since they add every person they speak to, even if they have only spoken to the person once or twice.|`|meQgxsIyaa	Two for sure.

It plugs into a filter which plugs into the phone jack. The filter has a place for your phone to plug in and one for your computer modem chord. That way you can be on line and still get phone calls. For whatever reason every now and then if you have trouble getting on line you can pull out the round plug (power chord) for about 20 to 50 seconds then plug it back in. The lights on the front will come back on. When they are lit and steady (not blinking or flashing) which may take a couple of minutes you should be able to get on line. Got the info from our tech support from our provider. It will only help if the problem is at your end. Let me know if it helps.<br>  Beecher I love your technical talk.

But, here is just one of my favorites:<br>  <br>  "You're not old enough, so buy a JUMP" (from the Ninja Episode..Naruto parody)<br>  <br>  "Are your dreams and hopes stuffed in your anus as well!" (from ep. 67 when Gin-San was in the hospital and Kagura witnessed the infamous "candle" bed scene...LOL)
ETQtL9VXaa	nope cuz i dont ask questions|`|gf3qPSGVaa	Yeah it does i have not yet had anyone star on of my questions. I really can't wait till some one stars one of my questions. I guess i will just have to wait.|`|wGoWP8olaa	Sorry to inform you, but I star questions that are amusing to me, it's not because they are necessarily brilliant!  The odd questions are among my favorites!  Yours have been very amusing at times....|`|wIBni2isaa	insanely happy!!<br>  I love stars more then I do b/a's!!|`|pgmXNpuOaa	Yeah|`|m5IsMZNxaa	i don't know because nobody has ever stared one of my questions!|`|EcV1ZSn4aa	Yes. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It does but that's not why I answer them. |`|c55545b2d79de3796d6ca86c13573225aa	yep|`|wzxoAF4Naa	Absolutely chuffed.|`|KN36rGMvaa	I love it when that happens.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It pleases me but my idea of happy is not quite that easy to accomplish.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Yes, but I don't really obsess or care that much. It won't matter 5 years from now!|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I dont really care about that as long as the question get's answered|`|GBr7TphLaa	yes|`|9qU9ojuDaa	Why yes im Oblitherated with Science'?|`|E5mzZZpFaa	Yes it does. Meant that my question was interesting!<br>  >=D|`|vu6EFFwHaa	So much so that I keep doing the math to work out my star to question ratio!|`|103d3879d1499695e3f4a5d95bcd053baa	i'm just happy they get answered!|`|Ecx8SQM3aa	If I say yes will you star mine?|`|rnppZZRmaa	yes<br>  but i dont really care if people do or not...  :/|`|G0wGbdENaa	depends how serious you take this site|`|uklCmMHFaa	i don't ask any questions...

ZiWJgVxFaa	Yes.....was that you....x|`|AA11709677	Actually yes.<br>  <br>  It was my ten year old nephew scared of a thunderstorm as he had never experienced an Indiana thunderstorm at that time......<br>  <br>  He's now 21 but I'll never forget that wonderful uncle memory of the night this lil kid thought I was GOD when he crawled in bed with me and felt safe that no lightning bolts would strike him and no thunder was louder than his damned snoring soon afterward.....<br>  <br>  I ended up carrying him back to his bed that night, sound asleep and then slept all night myself......<br>  |`|RunwQakIaa	wow...creepy<br>  and yea but its just me being paranoid|`|bJ4GiUsGaa	Just once but the bartender yelled " Last Call ! " and I ordered a vodka tonic but he said " I think you had enough, let me call you a cab sir! ". I was pissed, what a jerk, I mean he's not the boss of me! Nobody tells me what to do, not even me! So I left and stumbled home. In the morning I realized the bartender was spying on me while I was drinking that night, how else would he have known I had enough?|`|s3vhD3lHaa	yea it happens quite alot to me for some reason<br>  |`|hje4jCHRaa	Yes >.<|`|71751fbb8dacd6c20b10551584a1918faa	yup! happened last night, but then i heard very loud, simultaneous purring and it turned out to be my two kittens that were in my closet watching me sleep lol! super super cute but super scary. |`|LMLWimgZaa	all the time... i get so scared i wont even go to the bathroom by myself.<br>  i wake my husband up and make him come with me..lol....  (he gets and tells me im crazy...lol|`|f8c9bd01ff51e09b249de8f9ba836b5aaa	yeah<br>  all the time...and i hide under the covers|`|cM0D7FHBaa	Yeah, please stay away from my house and put the neighbors ladder back when your done. My kid got yelled at last time.|`|HeC4dhwoaa	yes but thats when i woke up on a train station bench after a good old night out on the town.|`|L50Mjo9Oaa	yeah my friend daniel felt the same but the thing that was watching him was his female dog.<br>  he has some issues which i dont wanna talk about.<br>   contact him at Danieldodo@emailatyourownrisk.com|`|ql1xGzFWaa	Yes and thank you for leaving quietly when I asked!! =?)|`|ADMfnrEXaa	I'm a watcher myself ... day and night ;-)|`|aVJyU3Tjaa	You know, usually I would say no but a few months ago I had a HORRIBLE experience ( I usually sleep deeply the whole night without waking) so I woke up with a start and felt there was someone in the dark bending over me and watching me, it really was a terrifying experience. Still not sure what happened there.. But it wasn't a dream and I'm not a paranoid person :/|`|MtjR6yT2aa	Erm.. yeah, the girl next to me is still watching me since i'm so amazing ;)|`|JxUFDutxaa	I've opened my eyes sometimes to see something standing at the end of my bed..when I blinked it was gone..<br>  <br>  So yeah..<br>  And can I say how creeped out I was?|`|h1qCOpFEaa	well......you are being watched.....BY ME (evil laughter)|`|FCFQRAvCaa	Yeah, but then it turns out it's just the dog wanting out. |`|ZxJ2BK2naa	You noticed me, eh??<br>  |`|XwFGg5wPaa	yes it's normally whoever I took to bed that night |`|PMiKw867aa	yeah then i fell asleep|`|WejTlNZBaa	yes. and i couldn't move or speak and i could barely breathe. found out later it was an episode of sleep paralysis.|`|Ga8sGuyRaa	Yeah, I saw these 2 red things & I'm pretty sure they were eyes...|`|iVjd9lE4aa	Yes, it was my dogs staring at me.|`|82388b0078348e0dd7d5a4f4001f503eaa	YES! last night! i got scared then ;(|`|7a905e0f2bf6c2469383a4cbac5f513eaa	Often, we have two ghosts in our cottage.|`|PULQiKsJaa	Yes! - creeps me out|`|WKcJE9bKaa	Yeah, once I thought Pennywise the clown was in my closet haha!|`|SLMD50eOaa	Yes often.  I live in a house that is over a hundred years old, i sometimes hear footsteps down the hallway and often feel something looking at me next to my bed at night.  The room i have now used to be my 17 year old son's and every night he would have horrific nightmares and would wake up screaming., I didn't believe him that they could be so bad, so  i slept in there myself, and i had the most blood thirsty nightmare in my life and i am 50.  My son moved out of that room and swapped with me but before i did i had the room sprinkled with holy water and blessed etc.  all is fine now but i can still feel someone looking at me from the corner of my room.|`|5G6GhO1vaa	Yeah, sometimes. 'Paranoia' is just a term invented to describe people who find out the truth. People might call me 'Crazy' or 'Paranoid' when I tell them about all the sinister things happening in todays world. You could be being watched, with all the technology that governments keep hidden from you. All people are psychic, just some more than others.|`|gT6ZtYUPaa	no thank heavens,,,|`|E5mzZZpFaa	Yes i have. Its weird sometimes i feel like there is someone outside my window. But i never have the guts to see if someone is out there. I sleep with the light on, im to paranoid to sleep in the dark.<br>  >=/|`|G0wGbdENaa	yh . . then i woke up|`|h7Z1QWgPaa	yes...........|`|KH1Dwyf7aa	yes I have.  A guy I usto talk to online told me he can do astro projection and has told me he has visited me while I have been asleep.  I have felt a presence in the room with me.  Freaky.  |`|TiBFerMyaa	Yes, and I was. By my 7 year old son.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think I just get paranoid. I have felt that way but I hope no one was watching me. That's creepy.|`|AA11904226	yes, but that happens at 5am in our house when the 3 cats are looking for breakfast and the dog needs to be let out<br>  |`|gLuDUbBlaa	I would love to be watched it would make my night|`|uGWxObN3aa	Im normally the watcher<br>  <br>  The shadows are where you find me....|`|q72IYtWEaa	Yes, I have.

5dMw30kMaa	I think its cause when they hit the ball it makes a thundering noise or when they crash into eachother because they're so strong. :D Hope this is right, thats what I gathered haha !|`|Zjl9HRSTaa	because when they hit the ball it cracks so loud that it sounds like thunder and would be very suspicious. they need the thunder to cover up the sound...or so at least people wont know the difference.|`|sBQvubj5aa	Because the noise they make when the bat hits the ball can be disguised as thunder. It is so loud that if it was sunny people would wonder what it is but they just assume it is thunder. [=<br>  <br>  Hope this helps- i had to ask someone too as they dont make it clear in the movie do they? Ta.<br>  <br>  Angie <br>  <br>  xo|`|epFCjq4Eaa	because when they hit the ball, it's so loud, it soulnds like thunder. they do that so that they don't make people think there is thunder when there really is none.|`|klzmFfjZaa	Because when they hit the ball, it's so loud it would frighten the humans. They would definitely hear.|`|Qr8og6l2aa	Because the thunder covers up the sound of them playing.|`|KvVTmlLWaa	It has nothing to do with the rain, that just comes when there's a storm, and the only chance they get to play Baseball is when there is one. This is because the impact of the swing by the vampires and the hit of the ball is very, very, very loud, and humans would find this extremely suspicious, so they cover up the sound with a storm.<br>  P.S. One of the best scenes in Twilight! <--- Love it. <br>  <br>  Hope I Helped, x|`|OlXiJPNbaa	Because every time they play baseball, the hit of the ball is so hard it sounds like thunder. Hense to keep themselves from being discovered they play only when there is a thunderstorm. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|f1ogWepcaa	cuz the rain causes the thunder storm and when they hit the ball the thunder covers the loud noise they would make by hitting they ball without the thunder noise|`|bQTFX54waa	Well it's not raining<br>  And they need the thunder<br>  So that when they bat it will blend in with the sound Of the thunder<br>  Because it's so loud they might scare humans|`|HUQiuulbaa	The thunder covers up the sound of them hitting the ball and catching|`|6263oOryaa	its more convenient sorta
bc387af5c789799fdd4a80c4ae80d44caa	Jiraiya.<br>  <br>  Itachi said it himself.  When they fought Itachi said Jiraiya would win (but be really messed up) and that it wouldnt matter how many more people they brought in to help fight Jiraiya (and this is before Jiraiya went sage mode, so i dont think Itachi even knew about Jiraiya being able to power up).|`|4qVWj3UHaa	Jiraiya, he wouLd beast itachi.|`|3FaosgzZaa	Well...in the manga they said that it would be a close fight with both sides being critically injured but...Itachi|`|tLyfneelaa	itachi hands down if Jiraiya cant beat orochimaru and itachi can kick orochimaru's butt it seems logical that he could beat Jiraiya|`|3ERx4opSaa	Susanoo unrestricted- itachi in about 5 seconds<br>  <br>  Susanoo restricted- jiraiya, although not an easy victory.|`|RmKzXvySaa	it's hard to say they both are good itachi has the sharingan and jiraiya is a sanin so i really couldn't pick between them|`|1gc8ikjYaa	itachi would win but in the other hand jiraiya has cool powers :)|`|KmkUBGaXaa	Um...why is everybody saying Itachi? Itachi sucks. Jiraiya wooped Itatchi and Kisame in that Tsunade arc of Naruto. Jiraiya. Hands down.|`|Zkw93uUyaa	I see alot of people say Itachi would win I think it would be a good fight in the end both of them would be on their last wing but I believe Jiraiya could win I mean I bet he had some kind of cool unbeatable unstoppable power I think|`|NcW3sAjvaa	oh god itachi. Hes the best no matter what and he has his special sharingon or however you spell it ^_^ but jiraiya "pervy sage" is pretty big and has the uhm frog thing?|`|c8f41e7ef5a2e7310f5e27dfdf71c18baa	ITACHI!

GtdoGHt5aa	Yep, it's about his diabetes. But at concerts whenever he plays it he says it's generally for anyone who has some difficulties in life.<br>  <br>  And no one knows if they were even dating in the first place, so I dunno.|`|EVxAcdpOaa	yea a little bit longer is about his diabetes. they said it before in many interveiws and at concerts. and i heard a rumor that nick and selena broke up...and if they didn't, its not confirmed yet|`|FwrrMsNtaa	yeahh, a little bit longer is about his diabetes ): sad song<br>  andd apparently there is a rumour that they have split up,, hope its true :) LoL <3|`|uCrL6IYjaa	Yes It is About His Diabetes (Read In Loadza Magazines & Was On Some Jonas Brothers Thing On TV)<br>  <br>  It Hasnt Even Been Confirmed That They Were Dating In The First Place Let Alone If They Still Are <br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  xo|`|EFiUwTTQaa	The song isn't directly about his diabetes, but he wrote it about what he goes through and stuff with his diabetes. He said that one day he wasn't feeling like himself and he thought he would never get better, so he decided to write it. He wrote it in a way that can relate to anyone with anything that they are going through.<br>  <br>  And supposedly yes, they still are going out. Though it was never confirmed by either of them, it seems as if they are, and still going strong.|`|grUstay0aa	yeahh, a little bit longer is about his diabetes ): sad song<br>  |`|XSa8fgNIaa	YES<br>  <br>  and supposedly Yes|`|1y84mVoMaa	no the song is not about his diabetes at all in yes they are still going together                                                                                   s????????

XuWhjrfKaa	His name is Bill. First clue that he's a guy. And yes, he IS a boy. I promise you. Trust me, it is EASY to seperate drag queens from slightly feminine men. Just because Bill doesnt mind being himself, and somewhat feminine, doesnt make him a girl. Go online and look up pictures of him in his bathing suit with Tom on the beach. He is a dude and straight. He's said it himself a million times and I wish people would stop making fun of him for no reason.|`|x7vB4P5Naa	He's a guy...and he IS hot!!!!!!!  He's got a twin that's in the band, too.  Yeah...he really needs to give me some make-up tips!!!!!!|`|YHu3jGq4aa	a guy lol|`|wEt7UiTsaa	a sexy guy! lol|`|49GfjLhqaa	guy. |`|tFMQ9n3Caa	Nah, he's a guy.<br>  <br>  At least according to my friend Damany, who has a sick obsession with them. I think the lead singer, Bill, is identical twins with the guitarist, Tom, but I don't really know.<br>  <br>  I'm not much of a fan, so I only really know what's been drilled into my head about them from my friends. :]|`|cJg3GruDaa	His name's Bill Kaulitz & yes, he's a guy. =] He's never been a girl...|`|EVxAcdpOaa	Thats exactly what i thought when i first saw them...i'm not the biggest fan but when i saw them on the VMA's they said they were all guys.|`|QzT6DV0Aaa	lol easy mistake but im sure its a guy|`|ChCQTKVHaa	he is a guy.i don't hear nothing about him,that he is a homo|`|HmWvy0oIaa	He's a guy... however he does looks very feminine.

I would have intervened somehow to avoid all the horrible things that happened because of it.<br>  <br>  Luckily, many years later (and a 5 year prison sentence) things did get better.

lHL7881zaa	you could check to see what the same/comparable models sell for on ebay.<br>  <br>  ~ good luck|`|oQSzZeubaa	Hi!  Check the Vintage Guitar Magazine Price Guide (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Official-Vintage-Guitar-Magazine-Price/dp/1884883206/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236451496&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Official-Vintage-G...</a> ).  Most local libraries and book stores (Borders, Barnes and Noble, etc.) have these guides, where you can look up your particular model.  This will give you a good idea of the price range the instrument would sell within.  Of course, a lot depends on condition, features, rarity, country-of-origin, etc.  Hope this helps.

Polar, as in the bear right? Go to ABC.com, you can watch every episode from season one and beyond.|`|p9M0eo70aa	there are a couple of episodes with polar bears i.e where mr. ecko is caught by one, when sawyer shoots one, but none where they show the training or the bears in captivity.
eCszB0MYaa	American Idol will have their Top 12 finalists performance show on Tuesday next week.  Fox will then air their results shows on Wednesday... head-to-head with Lost.  My best guess would be that ABC does not want to compete with the first week of results.<br>  <br>  I watch both shows and would take Lost ANY day over friggin American Idol.  The singing show is no longer interesting to me.  BOR-ing.  I need more answers to my Lost questions!|`|zH7VuQhtaa	No. In two weeks. :)

5c32c20454730c4d102bcfbf98334674aa	Here is what happened:<br>  The girls had one last date with him and they got to meet his family. <br>  His family seemed to like both girls, but I think they favored Melissa.<br>  Both girls also met Ty. He liked Melissa immediately, and slowly warmed up to Molly. <br>  On Molly's date, she got a little desperate. She took him back to her place and gave him a full body massage, then made him some stupid storybook about how much she loved him...yuck! <br>  <br>  DeAnna shows up which was so stupid and so obviously staged by ABC. DeAnna had the passion of a doormat, and it seemed like she was reading from a script.She told him he still had a chance with her, he said he wasn't interested. Then, she gave him advice about who to pick. She said she picked the "wild card" last year, when she should have chosen the "safe one" which was Jason. (Sidenote: DeAnna is now dating Ace from The Real World Paris).<br>  <br>  Now it's time for the final rose ceremony. Jason claims he still can't decide...then two seconds later, his mind is all made up!!<br>  Molly shows up first, and he tells he doesn't want to let her go...but he has to. She keeps telling him he made a mistake, etc. <br>  After Molly leaves, Jason starts bawling.<br>  <br>  Then Melissa shows up and he propses to her, she says yes, Ty come sout in his tuxedo, and they jump in the pool fully clothed.<br>  It was really sweet and genuine. <br>  They lived happily ever after, right.....HELL NO!!<br>  <br>  Next, is the "After the Rose" special. This time there is no studio audience...very odd!! Jason comes out alone at first and basically tells Chris (the host) that it has been 6 weeks since the finale, and he spent all the holidays with Melissa...BUT he does NOT think they are right for each other. Here's the best part: MELISSA HAS NO IDEA HE FEELS THIS WAY!!! Sit down for this one: Then he tells Chris that has feelings for Molly, and can't stop thinking about her!!!!<br>  <br>  So, Melissa comes out next not knowing what Jason just said. He tells her how he is feeling, and she is shocked. She tells him "I thought we were perfect. You never said anything was wrong. Why did you give me a ring and tell me we would be together forever if you didn't mean it!!"<br>  After Jason tells Melissa he has feelings for Molly, she gives him back the ring, and tells him "you are such a bastard!!" It was great! Personally, I would have used a stronger word!! LOL! They show Melissa in the limo crying and crying.<br>  <br>  Next, Molly comes out and tells Chris that her feelings have not changed over the 6 weeks. She still loves Jason, etc.<br>  Jason comes out and tells her that he just dumped Melissa and wants to get with her. She is shocked and hesitates initially... and I was thinking KICK HIS A*S TO THE CURB!! Then, she decides that she will give him another chance, they kiss, and walk off the stage hand in hand. <br>  <br>  I give the biggest a**hole award to JASON!!! Like Melissa said in the limo- she can't be mad at Jason for not being in love with her, BUT he could have talked to her privately BEFORE the show aired, rather than dumping her right there...and she had NO idea he felt that way!!<br>  <br>  I was wondering if VH1 is doing a second season of their show "Tool Academy" because Jason deserves to be on that show!! <br>  <br>  I am pi**ed that Jason would do that. I am pi**ed that ABC promised HUGE drama when DeAnna returns, only to have her on their for not even two minutes of air time!! I have a feeling that ABC wanted Jason to dump Melissa like he did, just to boost the drama AND ratings!<br>  <br>  I don't know why she would give the ring back. I think she should have kept it, then sell it and go shopping with it! <br>  I think Melissa should be the next Bachelorette! I don't know if she would do the show or not, but I think she deserves it!! <br>  <br>  Sorry to ramble on like this, but I hope you get an idea of what happened. Ty is Jason's son, but Melissa revealed today that Ty is also the name of the guy she has been dating. Funy, huh?!|`|lgOfrLIvaa	Jason had that one girl deana come back and say she wished she should of picked Jason instead of the other guy. She told Jason to follow his heart and not pick the wild card. Well, Melissa was the followed heart choice and Molly was the Wild card. Jason let Molly go and picked Melissa. Jason started crying because he loved molly more but he listened to that stupid deana and picked melissa. Then, three months later, Jason tells Melissa to her face that he has stronger feelings for Molly. Melissa storms off the set and into the limo, then they bring out Molly, he tells her whats been on his mind and how he loves her, (she still loves him by the way) and Molly says "I think we can give it a shot?"<br>  <br>  so Jason is all happy now and they are working on building a relationship.<br>  <br>  Ty on the other hand....idk.|`|Mcf6Jcycaa	Melissa is dating a guy named Ty since Jason humiliated her on national television.<br>  I thought originally Jason should have picked Molly, but never thought he would do what he did to Melissa. That was just dirty and wrong.<br>   If you asked me it was all for camera, like the two of them were already seeing each other it's just Jason was denying it over and over up until The Final Rose episode. <br>  Molly should have told that b@stard no, but of course she did not.<br>  <br>  I think they should just cancel The Bachelor too many people getting hurt.

ZzqWzFNiaa	Riki made that? It was very nice. It's funny that I actually hadn't heard anything at all about wildfires in Australia. I'll have to go over to the red cross, I'm a little strapped, but something is better than nothing.<br>  <br>  You make a really good point about positive and negative and which one people will jump at given the opportunity, but I think it's an ugly part of human nature. Why do you think the news is all fear and trash? Why we don't see equal time for nice stories meant to make you appreciate the good side of humanity? It's because the latter gets terrible ratings. It's a real shame too.<br>  <br>  Anyways. Thanks KP.|`|G6yyceAxaa	I may get lots of thumbs down for this, but i am following my heart, and ears.<br>  <br>  Elvis Presley<br>  <br>  He was no King of Rock and Roll. he was a country boy that stole dead black singers songs and made lots of money on them.<br>  <br>  with hits like "in the ghetto" (yea right, like he knows)<br>  Hound dog (blues singer Big Mama Thornton made the original)<br>  <br>  He was ok, but nowhere near as great as he is made to be<br>  <br>  PS, I did click on the link and read about the fires, and.....|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Yeah, I saw the link earlier.

M1ymLE9Paa	I am so glad someone said something.  Her hair (which I normally think is the cutest on the show) has looked horrific.  I've heard of people saying someone hair looks like a "bird's nest" but Maxie's hair literally looks like one.  My guess is that they gave her extensions or something for the red dress she wore last week, so she's keeping them for awhile of something.  I have heard that KS does get bored w/her hair easily (which is why she cuts it so much) so maybe she's trying something different?  I just hope its a temporary phase and that the bird's nest will disappear soon...or that someone brushes it or something!|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	I wasn't feeling the bird's nest she was sporting last week when she and John-John were heading to the club.  I liked the braided bun she was wearing yesterday. Maybe she's trying to grow her hair out a bit.|`|EhBF31evaa	I was actually wondering about that too.  Her hair is usually so cute but the last time she and Johnny went to a club opening (or wherever they went), it just looked messed up.|`|AA11657825	Last week was nothing new in her hairstyles, she often has wild hair.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	She had a bad hair extension & now they're covering it up w/ a bun|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Well, that braided piece she has on now is a lot better than that rat's nest that was stuck to her head last week! At least when she was supposed to be going to that party it made some sense, but why now?|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I know, that hairpiece was horrible! The girl was amazing hair and she stuck that on there! Made no sense and it looked absolutely hideous!|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I noticed it, too, but I also noticed on the other ABC soaps that the hair and make-up seems.....odd....different....not quite up to par....Maybe they're all skimping on the hair and make-up departments these days.....I know I'm getting a little tight with my money where those things are concerned.|`|AA12315431	Last week when she and Johnny went to that party, I thought her hair was a mess. I didn't like the way they made it look like she just rolled out of bed. This week has been a little better albeit not my favorite style either. I just like when she wears it straight.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I know it looked horrible.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	My take was that she was wearing the latest trend being a fashionesta and all.
30r4coInaa	It's the whole month.  Right now are the "big" storylines.  Whew, tune in tomorrow - Ashley's got a surprise for everyone in Genoa City.|`|AA11111233	Du to the switch-over from analog to digital last month for some stations (now moved to June for many others), March sweeps is the whole month.  Look for many things to happen in the current storylines, including Katherine finally proving herself to Genoa City once and for all.  (Jill crapping her pants when she does, and she finally realizes Katherine is alive, and Jill is not her daughter, will be priceless.)|`|vqUVWPBAaa	I think ratings sweeps are normally February, May and November.<br>  Not, the story line gets any better or worst during those months.
656079ce94cfd53c731f9d38d09cd09baa	It's AWESOME!  Yes, there is a lot of creative vocabulary in it, but you can understand everything through context.<br>  <br>  It's an outstanding example of Kubrick's twisted genius.  Hmmm.  Maybe I'll rent a copy to watch tonight too...  :)|`|2g8m8USQaa	It's definitely weird. It as been many years since I've seen it and I wasn't impressed. That's just me though...you might enjoy it.<br>  <br>  EMT|`|hQ95u9OLaa	I know a lot of people say this but I think you would be better served by reading the book by Anthony Burgess. I think it was not director Stanley Kubrick's best effort. I found it amateurish and gratuitous. I couldn't take it very seriously as a film. Now I know that part of the movie is a sort of sci-fi, fantasy, but you still have to believe it on its own terms for it to be effective and I didn't believe the fight scenes or the orgies. It just seemed silly. <br>  <br>  Sorry, I hope that doesn't ruin it, after all that's just my opinion. I do believe Kubrick's work needs to be reckoned with and even studied so I think that all his movies should be seen. But I have a feeling that you will be disappointed by this one.<br>  <br>  There are some great ones. Dr Strangelove, 2001, The Shining, The Killing, Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, and Paths of Glory. Watch Clockwork but watch these others too.|`|aOFdtoR4aa	A Clockwork Orange -- (Year: 1971)|`|MnewrjTAaa	Yes, it's good.  So's the book.  A lot of slang words in the book are taken from Russian but never explained.  Here's the one I remember offhand:<br>  <br>  Horrorshow < horosho, Russian for 'good'<br>  <br>  And "glazzies" comes from the Russian word for "eyes" ...|`|8f8b918d1198f1e196976002004cf9eeaa	Its interesting, if your from the US like I am you might have a hard time getting through the English slang... but its a good movie.|`|QhT9MjEoaa	It may be hard to understand what the main character is saying because of his accent, use subtitles! You'll love the movie if you're into weird ones. I loved it! :)|`|qElPexStaa	its very well done but some parts are very disturbing so i wouldnt watch it if you dont want to watch a heavy movie
Bk1t83pFaa	Insincerity, superficiality, and materialism disgust me, really.  I won't date someone unless they show me they have a deep-feeling soul, realize what is truly important in life (the intangible things that you cannot buy), and see me and respect me for who and what I truly am.  <br>  <br>  I, like any girl, will of course readily admire a picture of a "universally" hot guy.  But when it comes to the dating world, "universal" hotness is not what sways me.  Screw preppy, screw GQ, screw muscle boy, screw mr i'm the best dancer in the bar, screw mr i have a really nice car and i make bank, screw what everyone assumes is stereotypically attractive.  Those things do NOTHING to turn my head.  <br>  <br>  My boyfriend now is just an average joe to the world around me, but to me he is beautiful.  The night I met him he walked in to the bar with a twisted smile, glasses, a tan snap-up shirt that didn't really match his pants, and well...he was one of those guys that girls half-notice but pass by for someone more put together.  A mutual friend introduced us.  It wasn't his looks that captivated me...it was just...his aura or something.  His personality, demeanor, smile, laugh, opinions...the things he had to say...it was all like a siren song to me...even though he seemed so ordinary.  Once I looked beyond his glasses and saw how beautiful his blue eyes were, and saw the beautiful soul that lived behind them, I felt myself drawn to him on a deeper level.  As the night wore on...my intuition spoke louder and louder...THIS is the guy for you.  And no...it wasn't the screw-drivers ;)  <br>  <br>  So...it's not necessarily looks or even personality.  It's an intuition.  It's, like Brittany said, a powerful chemistry.  It's just a strong feeling...like his soul is one end of the magnet and yours is the other...and even when you're just passing by...no matter what kind of a person they are...you can feel it and you're drawn to them.  I don't find a lot of men, simply because I don't feel this way with very many of them.  But when I feel it, I hold on to it.  So, I like to think i'm the antithesis of insincere.  Maybe it's the plethora of Scorpio I have in my chart haha.  I like intensity...on the mind, body, and soul levels...nothing less.  <br>  <br>  Libra Sun<br>  Aquarius Moon<br>  Scorpio Mercury<br>  Scorpio Venus<br>  Capricorn Ascendant<br>  <br>  My man's Venus is in Taurus, which is Scorpio's opposite, and like any interaction between opposites, we're true to form...intense.|`|geJM58L2aa	I'm a libra girl :)<br>  <br>  I'm married now but I've never been someone who bases a 'crush' off looks.  And in relationships I've always invested my whole heart which has resulted in me getting hurt a handful of times.  My husband was my best friend for 5 years before we started our relationship and the thing I love most about him is his personality - he's hilarious, he's a complete sweetheart, and we never run out of things to talk about because we have a lot in common.  Looks are just the physical connection.  I think there needs to be a mental and emotional connection to actually care about someone.|`|vDGFRACaaa	Libra, guy, now that you mention it most of my crushs are about looks but are people I couldn't stand to be near personality-wise.<br>  <br>  But I don't think I could date or marry a person I didn't like, so I guess the serious ones are about personality.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Looks may catch my eye, but humor and intelligence win my heart.|`|uel6NBOVaa	I don't get "crushes". It takes me a long time to open up to get close to a person, but once I do, my feelings are very strong. I wouldn't waste my time with somebody if I wasn't being sincere. I don't need a relationship for the sake of it. I look for a relationship to find a life partner that will give me true commitment. Personality is extremely important. Looks are subjective. Realistically, I have to be somewhat physically attracted to that person, in the beginning, but that doesn't mean they have to be gorgeous. I have my own definition of beauty, and If my feelings are there, that person will appear attractive to me regardless. When I fall for someone, it is something that can't be explained....it's a spark, a connection, that I just feel is there. So really, it's not all about "personality" or "looks" but rather that deeper connection I feel with that person.|`|0HGqGJYTaa	Well for me, the way I crush is based on my venus sign, which is in Scorpio. I'm not a flirt like sources claim us to be. I'm not a liar, if I don't like you, I won't pretend. And just because someone looks good doesn't mean I want them. I have to feel the chemistry...once I feel it, which isn't often, boy oh boy. I kind of distance myself, but they'll know I like them because I stare. And, sometimes I'm filled w/lusty thoughts. <br>  <br>  After this stage passes of infatuation, the true Libran in me reveals itself. Brains and confidence turn me on. The guys that I fall for have a rebellious/original streak in them. Intelligence is a huge turn on. Let me know you're mind is working. I'm even more impressed if you show me something new or if I learn something from you whether I can use this skill in life or in the bedroom. I like learning.

I don't think he rocks too much, though.  In fact, certain songs make him go into full tilt howl mode.  I know it's probably torture to him but there's nothing cuter in the world than witnessing a little dog howl to Head Like a Hole.  I'll have to get that on film one day, much to Aug's chagrin. <br>  <br>  Terriers RULE!<br>  <br>  Persephone! - The battle is ongoing.  The long cold winter has only served to further fan the flames of war.  I like Aug's chances this year.  Problem is after you take him back in the house, he sits by the door, just begging to go back outside again, much like the kid who never wants to leave the waterpark.|`|57ui6xpSaa	I have a cat named Synyster Gates, named after the guitar player in A7X.

However, he DOES NOT like the Allman Brothers, which surprises me.

3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	The judges are supposed to select the top 3 after they perform, all within tonight's show, because then they have the top 12 announced and they perform already next Tuesday.<br>  So it's going to be a tight show -- 8 performances in an hour, and 3 picked -- man -- they use an hour like they did last night just to announce the top 3 voted in from the night before!  I wonder why they couldn't get more time for tonight.  <br>  Anyway, yes, the judges pick.  I wonder though if they already have their minds made up before these people perform.  They may change their mind last minute as they claimed they did last night on a contestant.<br>  But I really hope they only picked Tatiana one last time for tonight and then that's done with.  If they pick her to go to the top 12, I'm with you then -- I may not be watching the rest of the season.|`|gIjnoEi5aa	It all comes down to the judges.  After all 8 wild card contestants perform tonight, the judges will choose 3 of them to complete the top 12.  Anyway, if Tatiana DOES go through it'll probably be the decision of Idol's producers who will try to mask it as a judge's.  I'd like to think that the only reason she was brought back to perform tonight is because she's a drama queen and drama sells in television. However, the girl CAN actually sing. It's her personality that needs adjustment.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens tonight.|`|JIhpmOlRaa	Neither will I!!!  She is horrible.  I can not stand her laugh or anything about that girl!  To answer your question, I have no idea how the wild card round works either.  Hopefully we get to vote!|`|aXYiOskmaa	i think the judges will pick the final 3 since they think american got it wrong the first time. <br>  that tatiana is such a flake.|`|aihogb26aa	From what I understand, the judges are picking the 3  and are announcing it tonight after all 8 perform. It has to be decided tonight, because the top 12 perform on Tuesday, so I don't see how they can wait for America to vote. I agree...I think Tatiana will absolutely go through because she gets people talking and watching. It is ONLY about the ratings for the producers, make no mistake about that.

dibBENqWaa	What sign are you? If you are a Cancer or a Pisces, this would be a perfect relationship for you. Both Cancer and Scorpio are of the Water element; both are sensitive and predisposed toward being psychic. There is a bond of understanding here. You could meet a and feel you have known  each other for a  nu mber of years. The appeal is on mental, emotional and physical levels. the odds for your success with Scorpio are greater than with numerous other natives. There is no sensational blast; the evolvement is gradual, but the progress is steady. You build, with Scorpio, on a solid foundation. <br>  If you are a Pisces, there is great attraction here. Pluto and Neptune create a romantic aura and, once Pisces and Scorpio get together, it takes a storm of considerable proportions to separate them. With Scorpio you succeed in rising to Heights of creative intensity. You Hurdle the petty. The aspect between the signs  is a trine, which is very favorable. Great joy through children is indicated for you when in this combination.<br>  You will also get along well with a scorpio if you are a virgo, a Capricorn or a Taurus(Although both of you will have to make a few compromises).<br>   <br>  Scorpio is the emotional dynamo of the Zodiac. No stranger to the subconscious mind, he reads the hidden motives of others with ease.  A keen observer of human nature he fears no enemy, because Scorpio sees all danger and knows the weaknesses of his opponents. To be his friend is to have the bravest ally, the fiercest fighter on your side. To cross him can be deadly. <br>  He needs loyalty from friends, and sensual or spiritual experiences to keep him happy. He will reward you with his great devotion and understanding. Those ruled by Scorpio are passionate when they invest their feelings and things are never boring with a Scorpio sweetheart. The Scorpio Man favors a high intellect. He searches for real meaning to his existence, you could even see it's one of his favorite pastimes. He also values an honest opinion and in return isn't afraid to give it either. If your dress is dull, he'll let you know. If you take his breath away, he will tell you with utmost sincerity, just how beautiful you really are. If you seek truth, then grab his arm, the world awaits.<br>  With passion comes danger at times. Beware the seething Scorpio temper. It is not to be taken lightly. In fact, if it can be at all avoided, please do so at all costs. Tornados and hale storms combined wouldn't begin to show you how devastating this collision would be to pass through. Although, it too shall pass. <br>  The Scorpio Man is inquisitive.  It's a bit deceiving to think the Scorpio Man is trusting. <br>  Words from his lips might sting if he feels betrayed.  Be very careful if you have even the slightest flirtatious nature. If you pass the rigor of tests he has diligently prepared for you, then romance will no doubt commence.<br>  <br>  The Scorpio Man will lavish you with loyalty. Never doubt how much he values your love, you'd only have to look into his eyes to know just how much. Sincerity and honesty are highly valued here. The Scorpio Man has an uncanny ability to see through lies and shallow words. A scorpio man never forgets a kindness, and he will also never forgive an injury or betrayal.<br>  <br>  The Scorpio Man will make an amazing father. Stern when it is called for and wise beyond his years when his young need to be advised. The head of the table is custom made for this honorable man. Family is always his top priority.<br>  <br>  At the end of a long day, the Scorpio Man will be the one  who will hold you, comfort you, and express so eloquently how deeply you're cherished. There has never been a man quite like him in your life before. He is a most remarkable man who stands miles apart from all others. Be wise, and accept the challenge that is extended in love. In all his fantastic glory, and majestic presence you will never be the same again.<br>  <br>  Don't just go by  what you think & have read about this sign. Scorpio is the most misunderstood sign of the Zodiac.  Too many astrologers, in describing the sign of scorpio, forget to emphasize how loving, generous, kind, loyal, even gentle a scorpio can be. Many idealist who adhere to high principles and are a great positive force for helping others are born under this sign.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if the boy who proposed to you has had a relationship with another girl before he met met you( and you don't know for certain if he did, you have just read about scorpios), that is not cheating. If he loves you enough to have proposed to you, and you also give him the same  love and trust and honesty, he will never cheat on you. they are the most loyal people I have ever met.|`|kAuQugVKaa	Scorpio man have very difficult character. They sting those around them and sting themselves too!|`|7Nnbj1mCaa	I would not be above lying to my mate if I wanted them that bad. I can keep secrets and truth for life, as if the truth really never did happen. I would never feel bad or confess. Just live our happy little marriage, then on our 50th wedding anniversary, smile and look you in the eye and say: "Wasn't it awesome when we lost our virginity to ea other on our wedding night?"<br>  <br>  But usually I'm a v blunt and honest person. I wouldnt want to marry someone who I know wouldnt take what I tell them well. I want to be able to share all of me w my spouse. So if he's anything like me then he probably is a virgin.|`|4t4U9eFOaa	I am a scorpio woman but I can tell you that scorpios are very  passionate people...in all aspects of thier lives.  We are ruled by our gentitals (it's in the books) and tend to have problems with genital areas health-wise.  Just because one is scorpio doesn't mean that they are going to cheat either.  It depends on many factors.|`|ee1TLZ2gaa	Scorpio's live now. Not yesterdays, and don't rely on tomorrow. If you ask him, he'll tell you the truth. But he doesn't care for it as much as you do.|`|TZAkKFsWaa	Go for a capricorn man, scorpio will lie to you too much.|`|ZpF3EYTFaa	Scorpio men are kind, caring and loving. <br>  <br>  What if he lied about his virginity? doesn't he wanna marry you because he loves you?<br>  <br>  Marry him.

37d0ac4f141fb1b7b0505aabca80257aaa	First, if you want add movies to your queue then make a new profile. The thing about it is that netflix will only send you movies from whatever profile you want them to be sent to. <br>  For example, you make a new queue right? although, you don't want them to send you movies from that queue, so you just pick the other queue that you want them to send it to. <br>  Even though, your queue is still registered to your name, they will only send it to you from which queue you ordered it from.<br>  Hope this helps you, if not I would call customer service and ask them specifically. They can always answer your questions. To get the customer service, just click on the "Help" section at the top right hand corner. Then under the customer service section click on "Other". That page will take you to a number to talk to a customer service representative that will answer your question.|`|c661ffb50a295d702392241cf59b4170aa	This isn't the answer you were looking for but probably the best thing to do would be to just delete a few of your movies. I had a list of almost 500 (whatever the maximum is, Netflix wouldn't place anymore in my queue) and ended up just deleting all but 20. I mean, I only get 3 at a time anyway so...<br>  <br>  Maybe highlight and print your current list and save it somewhere (or save it to word or wordperfect) and refer to it but only have about 20 in your actual list. <br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

Its the producers way of getting rid of them.  Patch and Kayla are exiting as well.  <br>  Mimi and shawn are no longer together and not on the show.  Mimi and her mom were in a scheme together to keep shawn then to Shawn found out then shortly later he gets together with Bell and sail off together, <br>  As for Jack, him and Jenifer are not on the show, they are in a different state together. As for Abby she just sizzled off the show slowly. But yes to find out how all this happened look up the past on the Soap shows.

I say this because there are a lot of evil words that are pretty cliche by now.... ie death, blood, evil, hate, etc.<br>  <br>  Smacktalk  (grin), Dragtooth, Sludgepulse, Numbknife, Scumfrill, whatever...<br>  <br>  <br>  Another option is to use a short phrase that may or may not make any sense.... this is kinda big in the indie/screamo scenes, but there's nothing stopping you here.<br>  <br>  For instance:<br>  <br>  Death by Monkey Squad<br>  Left in Three Pieces<br>  More Time to Grieve<br>  Mack the Knife<br>  <br>  Finally, two separate words.

AXE1ukupaa	The best route to go is books, and keep in mind anything and everything that you read about dreams is someones opinion, nothing more. You choose what to believe in.<br>  <br>  I also suggest Barnes & Noble, you can do some free reading to find a book and author that identifies with what you dream most often of, and what you believe more likely to be the meaning behind it. Don't get too frustrated if you don't find the right one immediately, the more you look the better chance you'll find something interesting.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oztoPKrGaa	<a href="http://www.spiritnow.com/dreams" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiritnow.com/dreams</a><br>  <br>  <br>  you just put in the main word * like animal* <br>  is in the a's <br>  and it tells you what that means.<br>  It doesnt have every word though. <br>  <br>  <br>  dont go to the articles, * it says something about snakes?<br>  go right under that to dream dictionary.|`|AA10048169	there books you can get at barnes and noble

oK6yK1R9aa	In Emerald, Pikachu is only available in Safari Zone and is rare.<br>  But, there is a trick to catch pikachu.<br>  <br>  Before going to Safari zone,<br>  catch a pokemon with the ability "Static" like Electrike.<br>  The Static ability has two effects: <br>  1. If the pokemon with this ability is struck by a "contact move" such as Pound, Leaf Blade, Blaze Kick, etc., there is a 30% chance the opponent will be paralyzed; <br>  2. The encounter rate of Electric Pokemon increases by 50% when the Pokemon with Static ability is placed in front of your team.<br>  <br>  With a Pokemon with static ability in front of your team,<br>  almost half the time you encounter a Pokemon on the nearest grass patch beside the entrance of safari zone it'll be a Pikachu.<br>  <br>  One more tip: Catch as many Pikachu as you can, <br>  because one of them might have "Light ball" as a "hold item".<br>  Light ball doubles Pikachu's Sp. Attack stat and is used in breeding to obtain the move "Volt Tackle".|`|AA11025703	According to Bulbapedia, Pikachu are catch able in Pokemon Emerald Only in the Safari Zone, and are quite rare.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pikachu_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/P...</a><br>  <br>  Of course, you can always trade for a Pikachu.<br>  <br>  Emerald will trade with Ruby, Sapphire, Leaf Green and Fire Red.|`|A5wL7g4faa	pikachu is not on emerald u have to trade it from leaf green or fire red|`|qElPexStaa	i dont belive so, I think you have to trade for him

They should stop doing that, because of them, people do not believe in astrology.

From that you can get predictions for yourself, but never daily.<br>  I hope this helped.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Because the horoscopes you see on line and in magazines and newspapers are way too broad. They are not accurate. The only general horoscope that I have encountered is Susan Miller's Astrology Zone. <br>  You would do better having your horoscope drawn up according to your personal information. <br>  www.adze.com has a section where you can have your horoscope drawn up according to your personal chart.|`|bH1DYr5saa	I think it has more to do with the fact that horoscopes are made-up....|`|bkB2mBvhaa	because its bullshit|`|bdttDnlwaa	How Astrologers work out the very popular and unpopular (!) Horoscopes in Magazines, is based on the technic called : Solar Houses.<br>  <br>  So, for instance, a person who is ARIES, has his Solar House II in TAURUS, his Solar House III in GEMINI, Solar House IV in CANCER, V in LEO,  etc.<br>  There are 12 Solar Houses altogether.<br>  This is how they work things out for the general Public.<br>  For example, if the World Venus was passing at the present time through the Sign GEMINI, then they would find an interpretation related to ARIES people, as ARIES people all have their Solar House III in GEMINI.<br>  Etc.<br>  <br>  There is a little bit more to it.<br>  However I agree it is a generalization. It can only be so.<br>  <br>  I suspect that your Horoscopes are always the opposite of what is said, because PISCES is almost the opposite of LEO. The exact opposite being the neighbour of LEO, that is : VIRGO.<br>  Your Sun is in PISCES, and your House I is in LEO.<br>  <br>  Myself, although I am a professional Astrologer, I always find something relevant and accurate in those Horoscopes, because I am a double LEO. <br>  Which means that my Sun is in LEO, and my House I is in LEO also.<br>  In this case, the Solar House system works even better !<br>  <br>  Take care.<br>  <br>  PS : moreover, PISCES is the most mysterious,  enigmatic, and unconscious Sign of the Zodiac.<br>  But LEO is certainly not. LEO is ever clear, bright and conscious of itself.<br>  So one can see a dichotomy there in the first place.<br>  And talking about Solar Houses, PISCES is in the Solar House VIII of LEO.<br>  You may want to do some researches on the significance of the House VIII.|`|YjWw5oDDaa	Horoscopes in the paper won't be correct for you unless you are a Pisces rising with no aspects to your Asc, sun, or moon. Which you'd probably be more likely to have eyes in the back of your head. Horoscopes at least the ones your talking about are junk. I have been studying astrology for years now and the closest you'll get is if you read the ones for your rising sign,even then it can be a far cry. Now if you want a real horoscope based on your personal birth chart then go to Astro.com it's free and it will be just about you, and if you have birth times for other ppl in your life you can look at theirs too. I'm a Pisces too it's my moon sign  :-) well I hope this helps.|`|EVov2EdXaa	Astrology is very accurate as a tool to personality / character traits etc in people, pisces = sensitive, gentle, dreamy etc and in my experience I have found most people seem to fit quite well into their signs accordingly.<br>  However the horoscopes are total made-up rubbish and nothing to do with astrology.  horoscopes are supposed to be written by some 'mystic' person who is a bit psychic but these people are fake.

(for me...)<br>  just like for the human... when He created Adam and Eve.. they are already adult or mature.. they were not babies...<br>  <br>  and one more thing...<br>  chicken starts at C<br>  while egg starts at E<br>  <br>  so which comes first C or E?<br>  isn't it C?<br>  <br>  ^^|`|prKwpJ8haa	aren't u sick of this question? i've been seeing this question for over 3 years ...................btw the answer is chicken|`|mggll8dRaa	The Egg, of course....!!|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	It is a continuous cycle, to choose chicken or egg is to make an errorl
3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	I like Adam, he's interesting to say the least, but I can't say he's my fave.  I don't know what he'd put out there if he won, and I don't know if it'd be music I'd listen to.  I'm not sure about him, but he definitely has the talent.  <br>  I like Scott and can't wait to see him at a keyboard.  He's sweet and inspiring and genuine, innocent.  I like that.  I don't see him as a winner, but I'm glad he made the top 12 is all.  People who disagree argue he's getting a sympathy vote and he doesn't have the greatest voice and all that.  But I thought he was good doing Daughtry in Hollywood week.  So we'll see.<br>  I don't quite understand the deal with Danny, I guess I have to hear more of him -- I'd like him to do better songs that suit him, so I can tell what kind of music he'd be doing.  Otherwise, I'm not as pumped as other Gokey fans, but he's likeable I suppose.<br>  Allison and Alexis are okay, but not faves of mine, nothing outstanding.<br>  Lil is ok, but kind of like a hundred others, nothing distinctive to me.<br>  So far this show is kind of like another season like when Jordin won or Reuben or Taylor Hicks.  And then made even worse with a 4th judge and all these confusing rules they made up.<br>  And that they let in all these extremely annoying characters who don't belong, like Nick Mitchell and Tatiana to name a few.  Ugh.<br>  <br>  And what the heck happened to Mishavonna??? I didn't see her there last night, and I was hoping she'd go to wild card round!  Where did she go?  She was one of the girls I liked at least.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I just want to add: you see how badly Alex did, I felt bad for him -- but they chose him over the other boy who I thought was better than him -- remember that kid with the dark hair (now of course I forget his name) -- they had to sing up against each other in Hollywood to make the top 36.  And they picked Alex?  This is an example of where I think they wasted spots in the top 36 and could've chosen better.<br>  Felicia was even better who they brought back to replace Pacitti.|`|AA12390047	OMG I couldn't agree with you more.  Tatiana???What are they thinking?  I love Matt and Adam.  I think that Lil will be stiff competition for them.....and Danny too.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	WHY TATIANA? WHY??? I think they brought her back A) because she KILLED that Whitney song, but mostly because B) she's drama- people love to hate her.<br>  <br>  I'm not too worried though- I don't think it will be long before she's gone again. She won't win- I'm pretty sure of that. And did you SEE that DRESS she was wearing? What the heck was that!?!? Fugly, that's what.<br>  <br>  I'm glad Anoop is back!|`|KmC0K59taa	I love Adam too.  He's one of my faves.  I love Lil Rounds.  She probably has the best voice out of everyone.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I almost threw up when the called Tatiana.  She's so self absorbed and annoying.|`|rzuEjHpkaa	yeah<br>  <br>  i think adam is the best one, but i think anoop will be something great<br>  <br>  i hope von smith will go through<br>  <br>  just like last year, i didn't see any  good female singer|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, she is annoying. The show is getting more stupid each year.|`|SrRsoLfmaa	OMG i am so upset with the views!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  There were so manny other good talented BETTER singers in that should go past Tatiana!! im so mad!! I cant stand her, and i dont think im finishing out watching this season, it has just turned rediculouse. I want Adam L and Scott M. to make it far ive loved scott sence i fist saw him!!!<br>  and  Adam just has an amazing voice and personality and look lol so Woot.<br>  <br>  BUt i am so upset with this season. <br>  and HATE the ne judge.|`|bh8AjH3Taa	I Hope Tatiana Del Toro will win Idol now. Adam Lambert was found to have pics on Yahoo of him kissing some other dude.|`|HHNFrQs0aa	I don't have any favorites since Nick Mitchell didn't make it through..

cHLpGXyoaa	I know a few people who've been there, and they all have said that Bayfest is far superior.  The best way to find out when the event you're asking about is to call 251-625-6220, which is the Alabama Delta Resource Center.  They should be able to tell you the dates (middle of April generally).<br>  <br>  Bayfest is held the first weekend of October this year, and they already have well over 100 artists from around the world to play on the eight stages.  Not just blues, however, but a broad array of musical genres.<br>  <br>  Another good one is the Biloxi Blues Festival (around an hour west of Mobile on I-10).  Not only can you immerse yourself in the blues here, but you're in the heart of casino country (if that's your style) and the Hard Rock Hotel/Casino is close-by too.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't mind whether the blues is top-notch (Buddy Guy-esque) or more middle-of-the-road, but you LOVE your bbq, I'd suggest the Barnesville BBQ & Blues Fest in Barnesville, GA.  They always hold it the last weekend of April.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps somewhat.|`|xYRTtrhGaa	The "Spring Fling" is on April 4th in Mobile, Alabama @ the fairgrounds. The scheduled performers are: Jeff Floyd, Floyd Taylor, Mel Waiters, Willie Clayton, David Brinston and one other performer that I can't recall at the moment. Hope this helps and see ya there!!!|`|oxAmsa3gaa	NOT OFTEN CAN U FIND ADVANCE INFO ON THE NET ABOUT THE SPRING FLING,BUT JUST LISTEN TO THE RADIO ESP 98.3 THEY SHOULD SOON B SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT IT ON THE RADIO ABOUT THE DATE AND SINGERS.YES IT USUALLY IS IN APRIL AND ITS FUN WHEN THE WEATHER IS RIGHT.

I'd like to highlight The Machinist for the amazing physical transformation of Christian Bale. Hard Candy is Ellen Page's true coming out party even though her work in Juno is recognized as such. Ghost World is a terrific film and features Scarlett Johansson before she was corrupted by Hollywood's big machine. Lastly, Buffalo '66 because Vincent Gallo used to live there and I still do. The city is as devoid of anything of substance as it is depicted. Here are some recommendations of my own: Better than Chocolate, Match Point, Havoc, Pi, Requiem for a Dream, Children of the Revolution, Secretary, Jam'on jam'on, Citizen Ruth, Heavenly Creatures and Rachel Getting Married, Igby Goes Down, The Squid and the Whale, Running with Scissors. Enjoy.
yS61H04haa	Its been stuck in my head since yesterday. Horrible. I just hate the song. I really can't stand it.|`|lBZkXzr0aa	yeah,  you have a point but you have to admit its a little catchy.......LOL.   It kind of borders on a little stalker and pshyco.|`|lw6IqO5laa	I guess if you analyzed the lyrics... maybe...<br>  <br>  But you have to admit, it's a great song. :)|`|JGWSRfKlaa	Yes, I agree with you completely.|`|b26NgqOFaa	no I like it and sour grapes is my usual policy anyway.
e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	Wow, I totally agree with both of you.  No one is really standing out, I think it's going to be a couple more episodes before anyone really gets into gear.  With the teaser they gave last night, next week looks rough.  I find Coleen the most annoying, but granted the woman does take criticism amazingly well.  You can tell she's breaking down though.  Lacey is just lazy, but there are times when she does okay.  Andrea is definitely the forerunner for me with the ladies.  For the men, I think J is a waste of Chef Ramsey's time.  He's incompetent and notice that he never brings attention upon himself (of course, except when he screws up and puts the butt of lettuce in a salad).  Danny's pretty annoying and cocky but he's performed better than some of the other men so far.|`|e43c59dad3d9d6ca0d944fb64789b9ccaa	I don't like it|`|uGFzzLYWaa	For the women, I think you're right, but Colleen should go before Lacey.<br>  But, I think Lacey will go next. <br>  <br>  For the men, it's a bit tougher, I was glad to see Seth go, but I'm still not crazy about Ben.<br>  I like the big guy (Robert?) but I can't stand that simpering weenie-man  with the long hair.<br>  <br>  As far as a winner, I'd have to say right now Andrea stands out as a potential victor.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I haven;t seen one stand out yet...they all look like a bunch of bumbling idiots.
PYiQGwsAaa	have you not heard of an off button/switch|`|441GSyaMaa	Indeed.... I agree with you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmPpM47hRp0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmPpM47hR...</a> - funny, you may enjoy? lol|`|C8Djjxqkaa	They are probably working for free in order to use the BBC as a publicity machine. Compare with the "Any Dream Will Do" stage musical promotion for Andrew Lloyd Webber and the  Take That and Girls Aloud specials on ITV. So cheap TV for the BBC and cheap high quality promotion for U2. And who said the BBC were not commercial television.|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	Well clearly you think the BBC should listen to you and you only and hang everyone else who might happen to like U2 and their music.<br>  <br>  I personally would like a refund of my licence fee for the percentage that goes to making "Eastenders", however it's not just my opinion that matters...|`|eQVD090Xaa	desperate measures from two desperate institutions|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Because they're U2. Like them or not, they're still a huge band with an enormous following.|`|lmwVR1BGaa	Bono can heal the sick ,stop wars and go back and forward in time ,if he gets the urge.Everybody knows that, and the bbc also know that if they dont let Bono and his droogs on their station ,he would get George Bush,Barack Obama and William Shatner to attack them with all American military and probably blow them to kingdom come.you better beware mate ,Bono might be watching ! ( hey TI T ,in America your dogs might like cold water ,here in IRELANDif i poured cold water on my dog it would just bite me in the nuts .)  im just having a laugh,people|`|5MuTwO6naa	bono as always said"we are a crap band but we are the best crap band in the world".he would listen to people who like yourself can not stand u2 and he would understand you,so understand them that they are doing what they want not what it takes to sell a record.ok they are ultra commercial but what they have done bloody works and i bet they are not feeling crap about gong to work on a monday morning or how bonos going re-place his washing machine that's just broke down.good question though.|`|7DiL2Cwaaa	I guess because they have been around for so long, people just think anything they do is great, strange really, like Paul McCartney, his music used to be fantastic, but everything he has done since Tug of War has been tripe but people still think its great !|`|6Kq1ExFxaa	if he was a dog i would take him to the pound btw, dogs like cold water. The BBC want to be more like American Networks but fail cause they never attract the stars (which itv seems to always get and I hate that).|`|qr16GzNnaa	u2 are known to be legends, but i guess if you don't like their music or a fans of their music yes it would be like pulling your teeth to listen|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	In all honesty I liked them when they first started out.  They were a great band, then they got all uppitty and I lost respect for them.|`|UYmRjCY9aa	no idea, perhaps they have run out of tubs to thump|`|89GLig6raa	I don't know but I wish they'd stop. My ears bleed when I hear U2!!|`|B8uBcRwRaa	How do you really define the greatest band in the world - a much divided opinion according to your personal preferences.<br>  Get on your boots...schmoots if you ask me!! Feeding the same musical crap that is regurged out the speakers everyday.  Radio 1 should be ashamed of themselves.<br>  Best thing Bono did was just swear on Wiley's show - thinks he's smart!  Next on my hit squad is Crispy Boils in the morning slot - yes he might be the self-professed saviour of R1 - but who's really listening?<br>  Demographics must suggest that it's mostly 16-24 year olds who listen - a level of maturity that only Chris Moyles could achieve. A face for radio - he forgets to tell everyone that he's got his Stanner stairlift pass for Kilamanjaro in place.  Vile man.<br>  Next Alan Carr - what a mincer!! He sells himself as a the stereotypical gay comedy character - but does he not realise that most people laugh AT and not with him?<br>  <br>  Back to U2 - let's hope this live lounge falls apart for them and exposes them for the cras that they are!|`|dsOGVeZdaa	Ermmmm........ as if U2 need the publicity of BBC!!  They are the biggest band in the world, their album will be number 1 at the end of this week whether they get publicity or not!!  People who do not like U2, need to go and see them in concert, and then you will understand why they are the biggest band in the world!!  Yes Bono rabbits on, but that doesnt detract from the fact that they make great music.  Oh and by the way, U2 played at the BBC for their fans, not for publicity, which is more than what a lot of other "big" bands would do!!|`|fFwULPDUaa	Because maybe ... just maybe ... some people enjoy it?

0jIODmF5aa	im most likely going to get a bunch of thumbs down for this, but i read and write it. i'm only writing it as a request i had, but i read it. some are ok... but the hardcore ones, i dont even go near.... so yeah.... but if you want to read my story, click here: <a href="http://t0ki0xfanxgurlx11210.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">http://t0ki0xfanxgurlx11210.deviantart.c...</a> my whole(only) story is there....|`|Eg3VqGsuaa	i'm pretty sure they're fans but REALLY SPECIAL ones lol :) they're in their OW category.<br>  yeah i read those stories and the thought of them doing each other does freak me out but some are soooo good! i STAY AWAY from the hardcore stuff, too CREEPY/SCARY lol :) like i read one about tom and bill who go to the same school and bill is the school freak and tom is in a clique with the cool kids/bad boys of school who beat bill up anytime they can but bill ends up having a crush on tom and teaches him a few valuable and changes his way of perception and they end up falling in love. isn't that sweet? i left links to some stories i like or you can just go to <a href="http://fiction.tokiohotelfiction.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://fiction.tokiohotelfiction.com/ind...</a> (for stories)and <a href="http://fanart.tokiohotelfiction.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fanart.tokiohotelfiction.com/</a> (for pictures & drawings but some are WAY TOO GRAPHIC & HORRIFIC)|`|aitD50yuaa	I admit I do like some of the fan-art that people make of them cuddling and holding each other, calm stuff like that but when it starts to be like Bill biting Tom's pants off that's a little to far lol I just laugh cause people with minds they are brothers, not lovers, But the stories I don't mind reading them now, and then but I don't like the hardcore wicked stuff, I mean why would you freak your own brother?<br>  <br>  Even if you where a gay guy, Freaks me out, But Some photos are creative though.|`|c7GGP3Qlaa	I HATE twincest.That is extremely disgusting!I don't read those stories.What do you think Bill and Tom would say?They'd probably be a thousand times creeped out by it.If those people are fans of the group who write those stories they have twisted minds Imo.|`|ClqjiVszaa	they are fans but i think twincest is horrible and they should stop<br>  there just human beings and its so embarrasing for them<br>  <br>  and i dont read it at all and the pictures are so nasty|`|3lF21cFkaa	personally, i think its kinda disgusting and would never read it.. but if they like reading that stuff then thats just them i guess|`|wEt7UiTsaa	yes but sick fans<br>  no i  don't read them|`|mVOSepynaa	i think so|`|JQT61grmaa	i don't like them|`|1UOIoOzKaa	Yes, I would say they are fans. But slightly different fans.<br>  No, I don't read it. I don't mind some of the edited pictures and drawings of them, but stories? I think that's too far.<br>  Yes, I enjoy writing stories about Bill, Tom and the guys. But not about twincest. I would never write about that.|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	That crap is so ridiculous. Half of the supposed “fans” who write that s h i t can hardly spell, so they must all be 12 and 13 year olds in middle school. <br>  <br>  It’s gross and just plain stupid.  They exaggerate Bill & Tom’s every move.  If Bill grabs Tom’s arm, they immediately write a story on how Tom is now screwing Bill. Ugh.<br>  I’ve only read one twincest story which I kinda liked.  And even that story was so exaggerated and silly, I was laughing the whole time.|`|jsCjGUPuaa	i would probably say they are fans because how else would they know all that stuff right!  and yea i do read some of the stories but it also makes me throw up a little when i think about bill and tom doing it because well thats just nasty and like wrong.... and bill and tom like girls to much and have to many girls to be able to do eachother lol|`|qLhtnommaa	I do not consider them fans. If they were fans why would they write lies about Tom and Bill? Twincest disgusts me because umm... THEY ARE BROTHERS, NOT GAY LOVERS! I don't rad the stories. Those twincest stories and pictures are the reasons some people think Tom and Bill are gay. Imagine people writing stories and making pictures like that of you and your sister or you and your brother! Twincest is wrong on SO many levels!|`|tlLoQUsuaa	i hate twincest with a passion.<br>  i think its sick, although i've read a few and they give me chills they're so good.<br>  i think they're still fans, just ones with weird hobbies.<br>  ha :D<br>  oh! and the photoshopped twincest pictures are sickening :S i hate it when i see one as someones background on youtube.|`|FHBpJ3qvaa	I don't like the whole twincest story, it freaks me out, i mean come on bill and tom are twins, and the story the make are really weird, i usually never read them.<br>  and i think the people who make this stories r fans, but really freaky ones.

80ehnLBJaa	Yes.  She was and still is sexy.  She works very hard for the body she has.  I wish I had as much energy!  A lot of things make a person sexy.

VGCdDVrkaa	i totally agree with u... wen i was watching american idol megan's hip shaking was soooo annoying... the only thing i dnt totally agree with u about is adam... actually yea he is a little cocky but he has a great voice|`|aEntHSbqaa	I agree about Danny, i think that Braddy guy is a better singer but didn't get through because he didn't get as much air time as Danny. I hope Tattiana gets through, she is a bit annoying, but this seasons Idol is turning a bit dull, the show needs her.|`|d8HwFub8aa	I think this is one of the worst seasons ever. Mostly everyone sucks so dam bad|`|AwLz0Iisaa	I don't agree with you.<br>  <br>  I think Danny is an excellent singer, and there's this likeablity about him. Adam is not full of himself. He's a good singer. I agree with you that Jorge is a good guy, but he is not the best by far. <br>  <br>  But do you wanna know who I think is going to win it all?<br>  <br>  Tatiana. <br>  <br>  (Just kidding. Fat chance.)|`|AA10485813	I agree with all of that except the Danny part.<br>  He knows who he is. A soulful singer. He is going to be top 4 as long as he continues to impress the judges His story, his voice and his likability will carry him through.|`|bh8AjH3Taa	!!! Tatiana Nicole Del Toro WILL WIN IT ALL !!!!!|`|d2631fe7d345a7c8afa08dc5326ae6cbaa	Can anybody tell me why there were only 20 reject contestants (this includes the 9 rejects from group 3) there last night when they picked the 8 wildcard people? Where were the other 7... Stevie, Casey Carlson, Kai, Mishavonna, Ann Marie Boskovich, Jeanine Vailes, and Stephen Fowler. Did Idol basically tell them to go home, cause they had a snowball's chance in hell of coming back or something?<br>  <br>  What was up with that???

vrcxxRr8aa	I think it's a good idea, and not just something based off of it, like the Lion King. They probably shouldn't do the tragedies, too much death at the end. Perhaps Midsummer Night's Dream? Fantasy elements with the fae and the flower mix up would be fun for an animated film. I agree the language would have to be changed. No little kid is going to understand the original words.|`|6nkLWrxtaa	Oh most definitely. If they are made to be very kid friendly. A lot of movies have been loosely based on his plays, some movies have been done with the same writing but a modern theme and some have been done with a modern theme and modern language and of course some have been done as a play turned into a movie. I definitely don't think Romeo and Juliet should be done too traumatic I think but maybe Taming of the Shrew like Ten Things I Hate About You but in a cartoon might be cute. There are some that can be made into a kid type cartoon but some I think just can't and yes I would say that Lion King was sort of like Hamlet, sort of. I do agree with you that kids should learn to appreciate it because I have loved his work since I was a kid. When I was a kid I had a book that was written for a child to understand and it was great.|`|akcGfgdcaa	I think the medieval elements of Macbeth could work well, but it would be hard trying to make a hero out of Macbeth, and Disney always wants some kind of hero.<br>  <br>  Julius Casar could be a great one though.|`|kgfcc4PUaa	Yeah they should. I think Romeo and Juliet would be cute but not Hamlet because EVERYONE dies. Also Romeo and Juliet is a timeless classic love story.|`|JfoWgwhoaa	That would be cool as long as Disney doesn't completely destroy it.|`|Jp5sAxwnaa	I don't know, it would probably end up watered down nowadays and be nothing like the original. Disney films aren't as good as they were when Walt Disney was running the company. Also, the language of Shakespeare was not Old English, it was an earlier form of modern English. Old English is Beowulf ("Hwaet! We gar-dena in geardagum theodcyninga thrym gefurnon...").|`|uK3erCEOaa	Lion King was loosely based on Shakespeare...Hamlet I think..|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Yes

I will begin by controlling my thoughts. A person is the product of his thoughts. I want to be happy and hopeful. Therefore, I will have thoughts that are happy and hopeful. I refuse to be victimized by my circumstances. I will not let petty inconveniences such as stoplights, long lines, and traffic jams be my masters. I will avoid negativism and gossip. Optimism will be my companion, and victory will be my hallmark. Today I will make a difference.<br>  <br>  I will be grateful for the twenty-four hours that are before me. Time is a precious commodity. I refuse to allow what little time I have to be contaminated by self-pity, anxiety, or boredom. I will face this day with the joy of a child and the courage of a giant. I will drink each minute as though it is my last. When tomorrow comes, today will be gone forever. While it is here, I will use it for loving and giving. Today I will make a difference.<br>  <br>  I will not let past failures haunt me. Even though my life is scarred with mistakes, I refuse to rummage through my trash heap of failures. I will admit them. I will correct them. I will press on. Victoriously. No failure is fatal. It's OK to stumble...I will get up. It's OK to fail...I will rise again. Today I will make a difference.<br>  <br>  I will spend time with those I love. My spouse, my children, my family. A man can own the world but be poor for the lack of love. A man can own nothing and yet be wealthy in relationships. Today I will spend at least five minutes with the significant people in my world. Five quality minutes of talking or hugging or thanking or listening. Five undiluted minutes with my mate, children, and friends.<br>  <br>  Today I will make a difference.|`|33dede533743d2777e62a57f548fe2e2aa	Muscle Mass Does Not Always Equal Strength.<br>  Strength Is Kindness & Sensitivity.<br>  Strength Is Understanding That Your Power Is Both Physical & Emotional.<br>  That It Comes From The Body, The Mind & The Heart.|`|dCMi5rjdaa	Good Quote....:):)<br>  <br>  A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.<br>  <br>  :):)|`|1wDkKyLCaa	the journey is the reward|`|AA12356496	A celebrity is one who is known to many persons he is glad he doesn't know.<br>  <br>  Lord Byron|`|mtyhSPi9aa	Today is a new day and its up to me to change it ... <br>  <br>  a.k.a. .. just dont give an F of how 'that' bad thing happened ysterday|`|iBH7NTl3aa	If you hit rock bottom, you're only a failure if you don't get up again!!!|`|5rraSJRVaa	A ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.|`|QggEZxaeaa	" think twice before you say something that you would regret later "|`|XUQaRpgxaa	When life gives you lemons make lemonade|`|WuPwWf0faa	"nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down"|`|AA10345820	Don't let the b@st@rds get you down.|`|2qW1Q9fZaa	You fall away from your past; it's following you.|`|AA11101700	I have two that i practically live by<br>  <br>  1) I would rather be hated for being me than be loved for someone im not<br>  <br>  2) don't cry because its over, smile because it happened|`|b523d4db2b8136f6e9e008ee3a3250a1aa	The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.|`|VJiWuikpaa	"kettle" "pot"|`|il36RWQDaa	A random act of kindness a day will help make the world a better place to live.

d2uGruHiaa	I'm a Capricorn and I usually take everything related to my future seriously. I have fun if I'm not busy, but everyone knows that they see a great future for me after school. I'm reserved at times, but if you're a really close friend of mine, I wouldn't be afraid of being myself around you. I don't care of what others see me as or think about me. I have a humor that can be sarcastic and really mean, but I feel too guilty to do that, so I just play around most of the times. I hide my real feelings from those incapable of seeing them. I get along with mostly earth & water signs. I'm all about goals and I'm willing to do anything to achieve them. I can be pessimistic, but overall, I'm a bubbly, outspoken, optimistic, and enthusiastic type-of-person. I'm known to be honest and truthful/blunt. I hate liars, so I'd never lie to anyone. I would never hurt anyone that I love. Well, that's me. I'm a Capricorn. Hopefully that helped. :)|`|HSSuKNCUaa	Capricorns are wonderful. Three close friends and my mother are Capricorns and I love them to bits. Even if they're blunt, they only do so because they care. They don't waste time, which I deeply appreciate. When a Capricorn is your friend, you can count on them really being your friend. They don't go around trying to win votes, and if they consider you a friend you can always call them when you need them, or ask their advice. They will accept you as you are, even if they're tough on you.<br>  <br>  They are not always grounded per se, two cappys I know are actually rather emotional and not all that proud and overly strong. But they will always appreciate you, and treat you with respect. They usually have great ideas about what they want to do with their lives, and they'll chase those dreams and not even question it, which is part of their strength. They just do it.<br>  <br>  Capricorns are usually really wonderful people :-)|`|Z2bRNVugaa	Capricorn is one of the most stable and (mostly) serious of the zodiacal types. These independent, rocklike characters have many sterling qualities. They are normally confident, strong willed and calm. These hardworking, unemotional, shrewd, practical, responsible, persevering, and cautious to the extreme persons, are capable of persisting for as long as is necessary to accomplish a goal they have set for themselves. They are reliable workers in almost any profession they undertake. They are the major finishers of most projects started by the 'pioneering' signs; with firm stick-to-it-ness they quickly become the backbone of any company they work for.|`|n53BNB8taa	Good points: Very practical, solid and will be committed in relationships.<br>  <br>  Bad: Very cold, lack of emotions, hates money wasters, selfish, stubborn and likes to be the boss (not only in work place but in relationships).|`|g27LbLQsaa	I'm one as well. Everyone is different and individual regardless of their star sign- you can take whatever you believe out of it and make it apply to you- star signs are pretty broad, they are a generalization, they are not meant to define you. <br>  <br>  Some people have written that Capricorns are selfish and have no emotions. I don't agree with these traits. <br>  <br>  In my family there are 7 Capricorns and I would say that Capricorns are definately stubborn, we like to be right. We set high goals and like to be successful. We are generally patient and practical. We are fiercely loyal. We are honest and expect honesty from other and sometimes have a hard time forgiving. We are cautious when meeting new people and often see good in people and get let down. <br>  We pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off when we get knocked down. We have a good sense of humour and generally have an appreciation for music. <br>  I could go on forever- another trait!!<br>  <br>  All the best|`|iPoWzRSVaa	The Goat<br>  December 22 to January 20 <br>  Traditional<br>  Capricorn Traits<br>  <br>  <br>  Practical and prudent<br>  Ambitious and disciplined<br>  Patient and careful<br>  Humorous and reserved<br>  <br>  <br>  On the dark side....<br>  <br>  Pessimistic and fatalistic<br>  Miserly and grudging|`|qiq95Yz7aa	I think they're kinda shy.

AA12376180	The "Moonlight Sonata" 1st movement was the first piece I learned to play. I purchased the sheet music and a recording. I did know how to read the notes on the G cleft from my dismal attempt to play the violin, however the F cleft was a mystery.<br>  <br>  My sister lived two houses down from my house and she had a record player, so I would listen to the recording trying to follow it with the sheet music, then quickly run home and try to find on the piano the notes I heard in my head and relate them to the notes on the F cleft.<br>  <br>  This took several weeks and endless hours but I did learn the 1st movement. I wish I would have recorded myself playing it back then. I would very much like to hear how well I did play it. I have been blessed with a very good ear, not everyone would be able to it as I did. That was over fifty years ago.<br>  <br>  I do not recommend this approach. Get a teacher, learn to read music then work your way up to it. It will still be there when you are ready to tackle it. <br>  <br>  One of the problems is the 1st movement is more than two pages long. I have seen so many wannabe pianist struggle with the first two pages and never get to the other remaining pages.<br>  <br>  As you get more into classical piano works, you will find that once you accomplish a goal like playing the 1st movemnet, there will be another piece you will want to get started on and so it goes on and on. You will not be satisfied just playing the one piece.<br>  <br>  Don't try to do it on your own, Learn the piano properly and when you are ready, the piece will be a piece of cake (German Chocolate). My favorite.|`|nUkCnrA3aa	I can't read music either. I learned it all by ear as a beginner. *smiles* Then of course not everyone has "the ear" but it took me around a month or so of intent listening. But the quickest way is to learn to read, I still can't, and for my own reasons I do not want to. Though, I HIGHLY recommend that you do- to learn it quicker.<br>  -Ryko|`|3ZgtJK9raa	Sure, if you try REALLY HARD. :-)<br>  <br>  Heres the sheet music to get you started.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/10857299/Moonlight-Sonata" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/10857299/Moonl...</a>|`|XZ4RcUHWaa	A complete beginner can learn anything...it'll just take you a lot more practice.|`|b51742b2ebfe878273f788f1c8080cf2aa	I began taking piano lessons at age 40, and it was quite a humbling experience.  I wanted to play the "easier" pieces by Bach, Mozart and Beethoven--but it took years before I could even begin to do justice to any of these pieces.<br>  <br>  But after two years of lessons I tackled the first movement of the "Moonlight."  I worked away at it very diligently, and after a few weeks, much to my delight, I had the whole thing memorized.  I could play it through note-perfect.  But then I did something that took all the glow off of my glorious achievement:  I listened to my old recording of Rudolf Serkin playing the piece.  After ten seconds of listening I realized that I had only learned to play the notes--there was no music in my pitiful rendition.<br>  <br>  So, can YOU learn to play this piece?  Sure!  You probably can learn to play the notes perfectly if you work away at it for a couple of months.  But to bring it to life as a piece of MUSIC will take a long, long time.|`|64jTtN0jaa	It's going to be rather difficult if you have no prior knowledge or musical background. To be honest even if you do manage to somehow learn all the notes, with your level of expertise you'll be playing it just to get by. There is more to music than just merely learning the notes. Moonlight Sonata is not a very technically demanding piece, however making it sound good is a whole other story.|`|PvKGqW2Daa	yes, practice, my friend learned that in less 2 months, but he has no constant practice, if you're really good in less 2-3 days, you can master that, i can play Sonata in c major by clementi, and everyone was dazzled ahaha!!!|`|pd8Ujgzfaa	I whole-heartedly agree with mamianka. I've been playing the guitar for eleven years. There is so much more to playing any instrument than just learning a song. Find a teacher, learn to play the piano. there is no way around it.|`|AA10248966	By rote at first, and i hope you have a great ear!|`|sc4BtGxGaa	There is no way you can learn the Moonlight Sonata 1st movement in 2-3 days (as another responder says), without any prior experience!  You will need to learn how to read music, and be able to play the parts of EACH hand - which are often, not doing the same thing at the same time, to put it simply.<br>  <br>  There is no "I just want to learn this ONE piece" in the study of an instrument.  You learn to play the INSTRUMENT - and then you learn to play that piece.  This is like asking "I do not want to get physically fit - I just want to learn how to pitch ONE major league baseball game."<br>  <br>  This is not a reality show, where things are made to look like instant miracles.

I think after season 3 the writers have learned that if they don't start giving more answers than questions they are going to lose their audience so now they've been giving you more and more each episode, it's like they are starting to string everything together.<br>  <br>  In the first two seasons they would flip flop around so much that it started to get confusing because they would go off in one direction leave you hanging and then head in another direction and do the same thing.<br>  <br>  You're right, Wed can't come fast enough for me.|`|0BRnovJYaa	it's been good so far- I am always so excited for Wednesday's! It's been very different from all the other seasons, and it's a bit more confusing if you're a casual fan (which I'm not- I'm 100% obsessed!) I think they might have lost some viewers who couldn't keep up with the confusing plot line, but for those of us who are really into it, it's been exciting! I think it's just going to take some time for me to get used to the new format with no flash backs or flash forwards!|`|D0vv2HSAaa	I think it is awesome and I can't wait for wednesdays either.

mD7eAAoNaa	Lol you asked this question so many times, you must really want a good convincing answer, I can try to answer it.<br>  <br>  The Venus in Scorpio and Taurus is going to create a lot of intensity, yet remain sensual; very passionate (opposite signs). The Mars in Leo will make it hot and steamy, fierce. The Venus and Mars sign in their own way are compatible, the sun signs are the problem. As a Scorpio the girl is intense and passionate about her feelings. She will want to be loyal and giving in her relationship (general and sexually). The Aires is a selfish person, not appreciating what is given to him. There will be a power struggle, but that is probably only a good thing in bed. The ratio of love is probably not going to be equal, thus creating tension. But you know tension leads to arguments, arguments lead to break ups and break ups lead to angry make up sex. So that is when those Mars and Venus signs come into play =D<br>  <br>  -Virgo|`|ee1TLZ2gaa	Very good combination, lots of energy. More passion from scorpio.|`|wmNXRnPnaa	omg good long passionate sex

NAGiNKFWaa	Yes, I train my dogs to respond to their own words, sounds, and hand signals.  While they may not know what a particular word means, I am sure it is more about my tone and body language and the look on my face.  I was still able to communicate with my older dogs, when they lost their hearing and vision.  When I go down to the pond and the ducks say "quack, quack, quack, quack," it doesn't mean, "how are you doing this morning, your flowers sure look pretty."  It means "go back to the house and get us something to eat."  When the birds are singing to me they are not saying "thanks for all the bird baths all over the place and for keeping the bird feeders full."  They are saying, "stop you idiot, of all the wonderful places you have provided for us to make our nest in, I chose to put a nest in the middle of the raspberry patch and you are too close to it"  When the birds don't sing at all, it means it is toooooo hot outside and go back in the house and finish working later.  Our ferret used to pull our puppies hair when he got too rough.  Animals have a way of communicating with each other and with us, we just have to pay attention.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Dogs do with some words|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	Sure, they understand the 'tone' of voice more so , tho?|`|nqkXE1cUaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>  Their brains are the size of my pinky finger nail/.|`|8aCCj42taa	i think so...<br>  but i always talk to my pets...:-)|`|m2PlMByKaa	i know mine does he just doesnt listen at times haha like us humans. :(|`|lJZNGsZCaa	I think it depends on the animal certain words yes when trained but most of the time it is tone of voice they feed off|`|fHgbL046aa	I know my Marshall understands me when i talk to him because he tilts his head and gives me this weird look. <br>  <br>  Mommy of 4 year old Marshall (chihuahua).|`|KncPJwIaaa	Yea all the time remember were the dum owner to them LOL|`|iDTrTvg4aa	yes !!  they will understand|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Not the language, but the emotion.|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	Yea|`|qCCn17DRaa	Woof!|`|vrsQ1wMqaa	i hope so|`|tgUapnKbaa	I know my cats do. They love when the sun shines in the window and I open the curtains. When I tell them that there is a sunspot in the hall they go right to it and stretch out in it. That is just one example, there are so many others that have convinced me that they understand.|`|9EjzebnFaa	At the very least they understand the tone of your voice.   I believe they can also smell your emotions, the biggest one being fear.|`|AA11535303	Yes...But again it depends on the animals.Actually some of them do notice more of our action rather than words like dog whereas a parrot takes a good notice of our speech.|`|8wLJaVjqaa	ye i tell my dog to stay and sit and shake and clean the house and he does what i say so is that not understanding ?|`|11SCey7Xaa	Yeah i belive that animals like take dogs for example, they are like babies but we teach them how to do stuff...

This form of conjuring or magic often involves audience participation.<br>  <br>  Parlor magic -- this type of magic uses many of the same props as close-up, although some larger props may be involved. This is usually a performance before a larger group, say twelve or more, that could be accomodated in a living room or parlor. Most birthday party magicians fall into this category.<br>  <br>  Cabaret magic -- The props may be slightly large, as are the crowds.

Both brilliant stories and the Green Mile was made into an excellent film too.|`|O5KOwhovaa	The final scene where the camera pans away allowing Andy and Red to reunite in privacy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A beautiful scene in a masterpiece of a movie.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Too many to choose from and after reading everyone's comments, I have to watch it again, I forgot how good it really was.|`|R8JgmouBaa	where the guy gets the grant for his book library.|`|R7fuygiOaa	Where Andy plays the opera piece to the prison and everything stands still to listen to the music!

And, was caught<br>  by Rose's three hundred-fifty pound husband (who was known for snapping people's necks for a recreational pursuit) ... they were in the back seat of her Ford Pinto....  Merle, went on the road immediately after that.... and, has been "ramblin' " ever since....  <br>  Some people say that he would literally get up from where he was and dive through the nearest window... at the mere mention of the name BUBBA !!!<br>  <br>  ? ////|`|qsuYKa3naa	"I caught this ramblin' fever long ago<br>  When I first heard a lonesome whistle blow<br>  If someone said I ever gave a damn<br>  They damn sure told you wrong<br>  I've had ramblin' fever all along"

May be 5 minutes, weeks or months.<br>  : )|`|goM4NtsEaa	I feel angry until the problem is solved or until sumbudy cracks a joke|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	It really depends on who and what i'm agry about.<br>  usually it takes me about 3 hours to get over it.<br>  i'm somewhat stubborn.|`|qCCn17DRaa	Depends on how angry i am, and wether the situation thats made me angry is gone or not|`|r2jECPqsaa	5 minutes>>>|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I just take a nap or eat to calm me down|`|RD0yaJlgaa	I'd be calm if something would make me happy|`|Pfq2zRejaa	all day|`|2bqBmZPgaa	Maybe after 2-3 days, I'll calm down.

Sometimes one days lol.|`|11SCey7Xaa	I'm not angry the moment...<br>  Super happy =] <br>  <br>  But when i do get angry.... <br>  It takes me like 2 hours to calm down depending on what it is.<br>  Most times i just bottle my anger up..

AA10065759	There are ONLY THREE ways to get a backstage pass....<br>  <br>  1) You must know someone connected with the tour, more<br>  like a relative that works for the concert. Or, if you are lucky have<br>  a friend in school that has a relative that works for the concert.<br>  <br>  2) Be a news reporter. You would have to be one connected<br>  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.<br>  <br>  3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass<br>  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.<br>  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.<br>  Or answer the right question on the air.<br>  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out<br>  in a drawing.<br>  <br>  Those are the ONLY WAY you will get a backstage pass.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - -

5jQf5OnMaa	idk... but heres a really funny joke!! i found it somewhere on yahoo. hope you like!!!<br>  <br>  Little April was not the best student in Sunday school.<br>  Usually she slept through the class.<br>  One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, "Tell me, April, who created the universe?" When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. "GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep.<br>  A while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Savior," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep.<br>  Then the teacher asked April a third question. "What did Eve say to Adam after she had her 23rd child?" and again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ****!"|`|A7ovwP94aa	Here are 2 links to get you started;<br>  <br>  EMPLOYMENT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i606.photobucket.com/albums/tt145/afrochicxxx/Joke%20Pics%201/TheWorstJob.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i606.photobucket.com/albums/tt145...</a><br>  <br>  THE BLIND FARMER<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i606.photobucket.com/albums/tt145/afrochicxxx/Joke%20Pics%201/TheBlindFarmer.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i606.photobucket.com/albums/tt145...</a>

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Try looking on ebay. You may not find it right away, but if you just be persistant and keep on looking at least once a week (most ebay auctions are a week long) then eventually you will find it. You may have to look for months and months. I have done this before for rare music memorabilia. I once won an auction for an old paper program from the early 60's with Jim Reeves' autograph on it... I had to look for about 7 or 8 months before it came up for auction. Eventually you'll find what you want if you are stubborn and persistant about it.

It acheieved what shakespeare set out to do.  To bring entertainment for the masses.  He didn't write for the posh scholars, he wrote for the crowds, who flocked to see his plays.

IdGbtvaLaa	I love thrifties...I go to auctions, flea markets yard sale...second hand stores...find most everything I wear there...real vintage stuff too..!!|`|K70Hkq5haa	I've always shopped in thrift stores. When my children were very young, I bought a lot of play clothes for them so as not to ruin their best wear such as church or other functions that needed fine clothing. Toys also, as kids love toys be they old, used or new. Clothing for me was also a bargain. I'd be a fool to buy 40.00 denim when I had my pick at 5-8 dollar pairs. Whenever I had a big chore such as painting or cleaning my garage, barbeque grill etc. those thrift store clothes always came in handy.

64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	Actually, it's the episode "To Love and Die in Dixie" season 3, episode 12<br>  <br>  Chris witnesses a robbery at a convenience store and fingers the criminal. Peter comes in to the police station and shows a picture of Chris to the criminals in the lineup, telling his name, school schedule and personal fears. When the robber escapes to kill Chris, the Griffins hide out in the small town of Bumblescum in the deep south.  <br>  <br>  Peter makes car look like the General Lee and becomes sheriff with Brian as his deputy. Stewie joins a hillbilly jug band (called Stewie and the Cowtones), Meg becomes popular with her classmates and Chris meets Sam, who he assumes is a boy.<br>  <br>  This was Waylon Jennings last ever screen appearance.

vDGFRACaaa	Do you understand how frame rates work? FPS, Frame Rates per Second.<br>  <br>  So if there are 23 frames a second that means there are 1380 frames per minute. And 25 frames a second means there are 1500 frames per minute. In the same amount of time, 25 has shown 120 more frames than 23.<br>  <br>  Both movies have the same number of frames. But since 25 is showing frames faster, it will logically be finished earlier, because 23 is showing frames slower.<br>  <br>  (It just depends on which compression or codec was used when the files were created.)|`|b69e9fce1c50b18b4dbcf96d6e22b079aa	some times when fils aare converted to the format they are speeded up or slowed down

EioOPbzbaa	Nick was in love with Melanie (Max's sister) and he also worked with her father, professor Trent Robbins.  Melanie told Nick of all the abuse she suffered from Trent (he pimped her out to take care of his gambling debts), so Nick was in the background when Trent asked melanie to meet him and saw Trent strike her, she had a knife but fell and hit her head so Nick took it and stabbed Trent in the back.  Nick was arrested and at the sentencing Melanie pleaded with the judge to give him a break as he was protecting her (and he had some mental things going on as his mother had) - so he got a shorter sentence and was to receive treatment to help him.  He was fired, no word that he would return so if the character did come back it would probably be a recast.|`|AA11362302	He went to jail for killing Max & Melanie`s father|`|XRPtuwoTaa	he went to jail for killing Melanie & Max's dad Trent

AA10479574	its called personal preference. if alot of older people or even adults like them (which they do, many are just shy about it) theres nothing wrong with them.<br>  they do have something special to offer or they would not be in this business.<br>  not everyone thinks they are better than the Beatles. most (if not all) adults know the Beatles are more talented. there are plenty of people that Im sure are more talented but they at least have some talent.<br>  if they did not have any talent, not as many people would like them as they do now. although they are not my favorite musicians (many other adult fans dont have them as a favorite either) they are good in their own right.<br>  <br>  they just have their bad days and they do strain at times but not all the time. I have seen a few live performances that werent that bad to say the least<br>  <br>  its not just their music (or their appearance for their matter) some people like them because of who they are. they are decent funny guys. now although nobody really knows them personally its obvious they are decent guys because of the way they were brought up and their mom would not look so sincere when saying she is proud of her boys if even just one of them is bad. <br>  <br>  also many of us older people acknowledge there are others that contribute to the band so we are not being naive. some like the backup people too. I personally favor Garbo a little more than the brothers. <br>  <br>  besides havent you ever heard of the phrase "kid at heart"? some adults are and thats what the JB does for them. they make some older people feel good and younger.|`|1apvCdyvaa	people like the Jonas Brothers cause they are HOT,CUTE,TALENTED,NICE and FUNNY|`|valvULe3aa	Do you want to see how many other people have posted this same question? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=At18jLHLDbtlNp2H0Hl9kufRxQt.;_ylv=3?p=Why+do+people+like+the+Jonas+Brothers%3F+">http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...</a><br>  <br>  And seriously, I don't like them either, but let people like whatever they want to, no matter how old they are.|`|GtdoGHt5aa	Because we all have our own preferences.

It is where and how we may have some impact in the World, and be recognized, voire rewarded for our contribution.<br>  It is where and how we may develop some expertise.<br>  <br>  "The Midheaven, or point overhead, stands for the authority in the high seat of power. In a personal Chart it represents career and worldly ambitions".<br>  <br>  Your Ascendant in Aries makes you feel proud of your masculinity, and daring, frank, assertive, energetic, and lively.<br>  Now, being a Scorpio is not quite like that.<br>  It gives you more depth and complexity of character.<br>  Despite the fact that both Signs have Mars as Ruler.<br>  (this is before Pluto was discovered in 1930, Pluto recently being considered as one in a huge and distant Asteroid Belt rather than a Planet. Pluto ellipse being somewhat extraordinary also).<br>  This tells you more about the enigmatic Scorpio.<br>  <br>  When Aries puts itself forward, Scorpio prefers to stay in the shadow. <br>  <br>  So, the success of your House X, I guess, will depend on the combination of these two traits.<br>  <br>  Do you like Psychology and Psychoanalysis ?<br>  <br>  Men will play an important role in the good outcome of all your ambitious endeavours.<br>  <br>  Being rising Aries, your House X is very likely to be in Capricorn, so, "at home". <br>  Look forward to your more mature years.

Or does she not go to the concert, and stay at her dying grandmother's bedside? The made-for-tv film is based in part on LeAnn's autobiographical novel|`|o0CrpEyfaa	Rimes later moved to Los Angeles, California later in the year with her mother to persue an acting career. That year Rimes played a small role in the Made for television movie, Holiday in Your Heart, which based on a book in which she had helped write. For participating in the film, Rimes was awarded the "Rising Star" award from the Lone Star Film & Television Awards. She made her official film debut in 2001, making a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, Coyote Ugly.

You and those others who have answered that they couldn't live without music perhaps should do some soul searching as to what they believe to be the really important and necessary characteristics to develop in order to make a successful life for themselves no matter what obstacles might be placed in their path.|`|ulKSBQnTaa	no no no i cant because i wouldnt be able to live. i say that because i just love music and also everything can be music. everything that we do is music.... the air can be music, hitting a desk can be music ,and also popping your gum can be gum.|`|vbaEt7XYaa	I would be a very sad, sad person<br>  <br>  and i would probably kill myself|`|8UZKW880aa	Yes I can live without music but it will very dull and boring.|`|HolJ834Haa	difficult for me to live without music..<br>  it's like my soul's dead..|`|TTd8Tuteaa	never|`|7pRPn95Xaa	No|`|MeGehliuaa	I can but I don't want to.|`|a2708e7f671d2c5308a7fca7225d05d4aa	music is a part of life <br>  regardless what type of music <br>  so no life would be too quiet for me without music<br>  <br>  However to each their own.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Ask that of a deaf person and you'll see what a shallow query it is!|`|P93I8CHtaa	name:alex<br>  <br>  nickname:musicboy<br>  <br>  there's your answer,i cant live without music<br>  <br>  M.I.M.S=Music Is My Savior|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Of course.

hJP9y6kjaa	Blech. Not a good combination, especially if you want to sound good clean.<br>  <br>  Invaders are very high output, have almost no treble, and are basically used only as bridge pickups. Dimebuckers are somewhat obnoxious pickups, I think, with tons of high end and weak mids. Neither pickup should ever be used in the neck, imho.<br>  <br>  I'll give you a few options, and pros/cons of each.<br>  <br>  1) the most popular pickup set in the world - Seymour Duncan '59 in the neck, JB in the bridge. A low-output neck pickup helps keep your sustain (magnets don't pull on the strings as much), but is just as loud as the bridge pickup due to how they're positioned relative to the string (its a physics thing).<br>  <br>  This combination has very nice cleans and distorts well. This combination is versatile, will fit neatly into just about every style of guitar-playing, and will coil-tap decently (for a thinner "strat"-ish sound). The JB has a nice round tone to it that will drive a tube amp into saturation but still has lots of picking dynamics.<br>  <br>  The main criticism of the JB comes from heavy/aggresssive players, who feel that the JB doesn't have a tight enough bottom end, ie isn't ideal for chunky power chords.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for an "aggressive" pickup set, this won't work as well for you - both for the JB's loose bottom end, and the fact that these pups are more "sweet" than "snarl".<br>  <br>  2) My personal preference is very similar - the Seymour Duncan Alnico II Pro in the neck and Alternative 8 in the bridge. Again, low output in the neck, high output in the bridge.<br>  <br>  The A2P has a very "vintage" warm sound - very "Slash"-y lead tones (think "Sweet Child of Mine" intro). The Alternative 8 is similar to the JB in some ways - great picking dynamics, great cleans, nice and high output, but lays down this great chunky distorted tone, with a tight low end that's great for palm-muting.<br>  <br>  Both pickups complement each other well and coil-tap well.<br>  <br>  3) Seymour Duncan Blackouts<br>  <br>  High output, low noise active pickups. The Blackouts have more bass and treble than the EMG 81/85's, so they sound better for more modern rock and metal. I don't have any personal experience with them, but the YouTube clips sure sound good.<br>  <br>  I think the cleans aren't quite as nice as a good set of passives, and you'll get a bit less dynamic response... but that's pretty much across the board will all active pickups. You sacrifice bandwidth for gain.<br>  <br>  4) Dragonfire Actives<br>  <br>  I'm throwing this out there because I just got the set, it's cheap, and it sounds pretty decent for rock/metal. It's basically a generic version of EMGs. They're active, so basically no noise, which is good. The tone isn't sophisticated or detailed, it definitely doesn't have the definition of the passive pickups, for instance .... but it sounds good distorted, and that's what matters to me. I've got a pair on an LTD EC-50, and it's my "metal" guitar. Looks good, sounds great for the metal thing, so that's all that matters to me. For 100$ after tax and shipping for the set, including the components for installation? Heck yeah, worth every penny...<br>  <br>  They don't coil-tap, and like all active pickups you have to play around with the distance from the strings so they sound right, but the battery lasts a long time, so it's all good.<br>  <br>  Dragonfire also has some cool onboard effects you can throw in your guitar - an onboard distortion unit, a kind of maximizer, etc. Link below. I've also heard good things about their Chrome Screamer pickups... but I think the neck pickups look a little too hot for me... Dunno, I'm sure I'll give 'em a shot sooner or later...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

I've got a 1970 Les Paul Custom that sound pretty darned good through this little Peavey practice amp I keep on the work bench for testing.<br>  <br>  I've also got some cheap Explorer knock-off (it's made out of plywood and masonite) that sounds hideous through the Peavey.  However, through my Matchless Chieftain, it sounds alright.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick one of the other, I would say the guitar.  But not necessarily from the "tone" aspect.  If you have a guitar that's physically hard to play and won't intonate correctly, it won't matter if you're plugging into a $50 Crate or a $10,000 Dumble...you won't be playing your best.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, Tx<br>  <br>  Ken|`|OSomjqYdaa	the guitar....if you play good it's good-no matter how loud.

India's great diversity of cultural practices, languages, customs, and traditions are examples of this unique co-mingling over the past five Millennium.

M8qLP7MLaa	While it's strongly hinted that Kakashi's dead - no one has come out and clearly stated that he's dead. Until that happens, we can't say for sure.<br>  <br>  It's not just pointless murder though. Jiraiya died for a reason. His message was a huge help to Konoha. Kakashi - IF he is dead - died for a reason. IF Hinata is dead - then she'll have died for a reason as well. <br>  <br>  Character's don't just get killed off because the author is having a bad day and feels like killing someone off. It's for the sake of the story. If it happens it happens, there's not much we can do about it.<br>  <br>  But if it makes you feel better - Naruto will probably hand Pain's *** to him in the next few chapters. I can't exactly see Neji being a cup of sunshine either. XD I mean, he just got there.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Naruhina fans are crying|`|AA10968947	first of all, it's NOT okay that Masashi is killing everyone off. Especially the great characters [can't he just kill Sakura? I mean--e.e'']. AND it's still not clear if Kakashi really died... But I seriously hope he didn't Naruto would suck without him.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I SO don't want Hinata to die there, without even hearing Naruto's response. It's..it's...unfair...<br>  it would have been the perfect moment if she didn't die. And she said "love", not "like".>///<''<br>  But there were 6 tails, the maniest released so far!! He reacted like that when Pein "killed" [not yet sure] Hinata. He wasn't THAT mad when Kakashi "died"[not sure either], or when Jiraiya was killed. So...I know Naruto is shoujo, but maybe, just maybe, as I'm a girl and a fan of the series[AND of NaruHina..], there would be SOME space for romance..X3<br>  <br>  [chant to self: Naruto likes Hinata, Naruto likes Hinata, zomg~!!! Naruto likes Hinata....]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but before that, pleeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaase show Kakashi!!! What happened to him??TTT-TTT<br>  I don't believe he'll die just like that!!|`|n0uMBKtJaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOO, HINATA YOU WERE ALWAYS MY FAVORITE!!!!

If she died she would definately not be important to plot like i've laways believed she was|`|FIwBccyiaa	i agree with u 100 no 1000%<br>  but maybe if she does end up dying its not yet and a bit later on after naruto kills off pain and he runs o er and she looks at him and he looks at her and say thngs like "No don die, no u cant die not after all this..T_T..i dont want u to die...I LOVE YOU TOO..! then she dies with a smiling face..or maybe the will of his love to her as well will make her strong and not want to die and not let herself die.....<br>  <br>  god me and my imaginations..<br>  <br>  but i still soooooo agree with u..this is just depressing..damn that kishimoto.and u had my hopes up for a good ending with those 2 and then u crushed them in like the next pg were she is hit with pains power...god damn it...i will never forgive u if she dies.......<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  also forgot to mention...<br>  i think naruto returns these feelings, maybe when she said i love u it lit up a spark in his heart making him realize his true feelings for hinata, not his perverted feelings towards SAKURA witch should die in hinatas place...<br>  when pain bashes hinata naruto is shoked and so angry..that he spazzes out and get 6 tails all because f what he did to Hinata (witch sounds like love to me) witch i think is soo sweet and sad at the same time...he really mite love her back....and another thing is he wasnt as mad when jiraiya and kakashi as he was about hinata...<3 and at the same time </3|`|T1qvc4HWaa	I can't believe she did that!

There are a few choices:<br>  <br>  Metal Mute: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heavy-Brass-Practice-Violin-Small/dp/B000F3KTGM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=musical-instruments&qid=1235757352&sr=1-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Heavy-Brass-Practi...</a><br>  The problem with this is that kind of distort the pitch on your instruments, so you can't work with your intonation. Otherwise, they really mute the sound very well. <br>  <br>  Rubber Mute: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glaesel-Violin-Ultra-Practice-Mute/dp/B0002II6V0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=musical-instruments&qid=1235757352&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Glaesel-Violin-Ult...</a><br>  They mute a little less, but they don't distort the pitch as much. I would go with this one. Plus, it's cheaper too.|`|pd8Ujgzfaa	Don't make it quiet! People need to hear some decent music! Play it loud and proud, and whoever doesn't like it, TOO BAD! I know this is a rock n' roll attitude, but I think it works well here. I like rock, but classical is so much more intricate and beautiful. Therefore, since it is real music, why mute it?|`|tmz1dbvXaa	You could buy a practice mute. Many instrument stores carry them. <br>  I think Yamaha sells a kind of "silent violin" where you play regularly, but you wear earbuds, kind of like in a ipod.

hP2nzb2haa	A glow in the dark party is pretty simple... rent a Reception Hall  and must hire a party planner or DIY at your home. This is your DIY tips:You will need to buy some black lights from your local dollar store, as many as possible is recommended. Call the stores first, most are out, usually availabe around Halloween season. (I do know Walgreen have them right now and usually always do. Go to your local Walgreen store or check the website to see which Walgreen store have blacklight in your area, type: blacklight... don't get the cheap kinds it doesn't work as great, fluorescents are the best.) Replace all regular light bulbs with the black lights for the party in four corners wall. The lights will have better reflex. Buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc.. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces) Your party be in the evening can be held in the backyard or inside the house with a big-wide party room, but if you want it during the day, pick up some plain black sheets and drape all windows and doors with the sheets to keep the daylight from entering your party atmosphere.<br>  Along with your black lights, if it is possible to get strobe lights or a disco ball, go for it! Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. <br>  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. White balloons are the best, just put the small green glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  Buy some yellow highlight markers and white paper banners to put on your walls. Let guests write on the banners if they'd like. Buy some big star glow in the dark stickers and stick them up on walls and your ceiling. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. Tell friends to do the same, if they want to. Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each others faces! White will glow against the black lights very well. <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelery<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewellery sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew or buy some package of Jell-O package and mix it up with Lime Soda. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. Get sherbert ice creams and cupcakes/cake in neon colors. they're fun.... be creative and fun!<br>  <br>  Get blacklights and ask everyone to wear all white. Their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. If you can, hire a DJ for the party. Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula hoops, hot potatoe with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor. (One ball is perfect.) Have a super great time!|`|8SbgHDqfaa	Oh no.

VyhfMVXBaa	Metal, Black Sabbath all the way! Anything off their first albums is great, but since you asked to name songs, go with A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning.<br>  <br>  For some super heavy old school punk, go with Black Flag. Their earlier tracks are straight up hardcore (like Clocked In, Revenge, Six Pack) and their later stuff is heavy, jazzy avant-garde sludge-punk. <br>  <br>  Another great band like late Black Flag is Eyehategod. I like the song Thirty Dollar Bag.<br>  <br>  For more "happy" punk, Old Friend by Rancid is a killer track.<br>  <br>  Black Friday Rule by Flogging Molly is a good one.<br>  <br>  The Decline is a masterpiece by NoFX.<br>  <br>  If you are more in the mood for oldschool, Betray by Minor Threat.<br>  <br>  Thrash (a good bridge between punk and metal) I'd say go for DRI, Anthrax, or Guilty Fingers (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/guiltyfingers" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/guiltyfingers</a> ).<br>  <br>  Pop-punk, I already mentioned NoFX and Rancid, but also check out Crimpshrine. <br>  <br>  Also, Operation Ivy's 'Take Warning' and 'The Crowd' are two amazing tracks that capture their dynamic ability to bring hardcore and ska into 'pop punk', if you even want to call it that. <br>  <br>  Bands like good charlotte have shat all over the genre of pop punk, so many like to call the pop punk bands of the 80s 'skate punk' or 'street punk'<br>  <br>  too many.. i'm just trying to pick out some of my favorite tracks, but i should be talking more in terms of favorite bands, because even that list would take some time to make.|`|VSB98koJaa	Ones that never get played.|`|mHlLVsSvaa	Bottles To The Ground - NOFX<br>  Friday, I'm In Love - The Cure<br>  Stairway To Heaven - Led Zepplin<br>  It's My Life - Bon Jovi<br>  All In The Name Of... - Motley Crue<br>  Run To The Hills - Iron Maiden<br>  Paranoid - Black Sabbath.|`|877DYKn9aa	For some good punk you can always go for the UK bands, but if you want deep lyrical meaning combined with good crazy punk then DEFINATELY go for Rise Against.<br>  <br>  Give It All - Rise Against, sums up punk.<br>  <br>  For some Heavy Metal, depends what area of Metal you want.  Personally I'd say In Flames, Children Of Bodom, and All That Remains should give you a good balance.<br>  <br>  The Mirror's Truth - In Flames<br>  Tie My Rope - Children Of Bodom<br>  This Calling - All That Remains<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Those are just a few examples, if you want more, send me an email, I have over 100 cd's worth of metal, punk, and hard rock ;]|`|r3vW3zU1aa	Deliverance - Opeth<br>  Master Apprentices - Opeth<br>  Are You Dead Yet? - Children of Bodom<br>  Vacuum - In Flames<br>  Crawl Through Knifes - In Flames<br>  Mechanic God Creation - Arch Enemy<br>  M.I.A. - Avenged Sevenfold<br>  Bat Country - Avenged Sevenfold<br>  Scream Aim Fire - Bullet for My Valentine<br>  Redneck - Lamb of God<br>  Black Label - Lamb of God<br>  Sick of You - GWAR<br>  Roswell 47 - Hypocrisy<br>  Remembrance - Gojira<br>  On Earth - Samael<br>  Supra Karma - Samael<br>  My Fears Have Become Phobias - As Blood Runs Black<br>  Hester Prynne - As Blood Runs Black<br>  Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr - Trivium<br>  Like Light to Flies - Trivium<br>  Love Lost in a Hail of Gun Fire - Bleeding Through<br>  On Wings of Lead - Bleeding Through<br>  Nemesis - Arch Enemy<br>  We Will Rise - Arch Enemy<br>  End of the Line - Arch Enemy

She said that it's "highly unlikely" that he will get a jail term as it is his first offence. There was also some talk of a possible domestic counselling (or community service, as you said) for him. So I guess they've pretty much summed it up.

6KTVBhvgaa	I liked Carla too.  She showed her true personality through competition. I believe she carried herself well.  Fabio is cool too just think maybe the show pushed for him to win because of his situation at home.  Maybe he needed the money and let the public know it is for his family.|`|3833a9c0e41e755c1634299dc544c671aa	Fabio and Carla were great. I liked Jamie too and even Stefan wasn't so bad.<br>  <br>  Boooos to Hosea and Leah. Yuck!|`|AA11878029	I love Fabio...Carla was fun to watch !!|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I loved Carla, but when it came to who I thought had the best all-around personality, I thought it was Fabio.  I was happy he won.  I mean, just listening to him is fun; he reminds me of Chico Marx.  :-)|`|AA12227599	Carla was my fave too. Damn Casey for screwing her up. Obviously she didn't win for a reason. As far as Fabio, I think it's because he was funny and cute, not because he can cook, because he was in the bottom 3 almost every single challenge.|`|5c32c20454730c4d102bcfbf98334674aa	I was shocked that Fabio was the winner. I was thinking Carla because she made it so far, and she always had such a positive attitude. <br>  I have no pity for Leah and Hosea either. Who would be so stupid to cheat when cameras will catch you!!!|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I wanted Fabio to get it even though Carla was my favorite.  She won the car and Fabio is so cute & funny.  So I was fine with him being fan favorite...I think Hosea deserves better than Leah... I didn't like her at all|`|RDQittNDaa	who cares
e0JI6a93aa	I really hope Adam to win he has an incredible voice and he's the best out there ......|`|wcQW38Xgaa	to be honest with you, i'm still pretty upset they let that other girl go, i forgot her name, but the one they made the big deal over because she had a record deal before and worked as Annie in the play? well i thought it was unfair and she deserved a shot. and whats up with the drama between the 2 judges? it seems unclassy. but if someone were to win i would like adam to win also because he has an awesome voice.|`|AA10965874	Lil Round, Scott,   i really like ju'not   <--spelling?   but he didnt make it|`|jUg9HAOjaa	Alexis or Lil' Rounds<br>  <br>  I really like Tatiana too, but I don't think there's any chance of her making it that far, too many people hate her for no reason.<br>  I'm just hoping she makes it to the top 12, so she can at least go on tour, and maybe pick up a record deal so I can buy her CD.<br>  <br>  Adam good for you! :)<br>  <a href="http://blogged.the-protagonist.net/2009/03/03/adam-lambert-kisses-boys/" rel="nofollow">http://blogged.the-protagonist.net/2009/...</a><br>  <br>  Okay I hope you win too so they finally overturn prop 8.|`|4fa79abc921b5615b3a81280bdca2d2baa	I think Adam Lambert will win, or that Lil Rounds girl. I don't know if it's just me, but Adam Lambert reminds me of David Cook.|`|JT80fmkiaa	Adam Lambert is pretty good, he's definitely gay but that doesn't matter to me.  I want Danny Gokey to win!!!!!  I love his voice and everything about him!   I am a huge fan of the show my daughter and I watch every episode and then at the end of the year we go to the concert (dorks!)  We love trying out the new pop tart flavor that they hand out after the concert, except last year there were NO POP TARTS!!!!!!!  We were so bummed!!!!!!!!|`|bh8AjH3Taa	I want Tatiana Nicole Del Toro to win. Adam is gay. Yahoo showed pictures of him kissing some other guy.|`|CApnEZ83aa	Danny Gokey.

yJCdLNHwaa	Smirk:<br>  When you think you know the answer and do not<br>  <br>  Grin:<br>  When you know for sure.|`|a6kZ2q8Kaa	I think it is that a smirk does not show ones teeth whereas a grin does showing the upper teeth only and with the lower lip touching the lower edges of the upper teeth. How about that?|`|c1e077ca88966e8fba4354709743a0bfaa	You smirk before sex, and grin after.|`|PUAUR9Quaa	no difference, people are just stupid|`|wl02lAReaa	A smirk is a small smile sometimes characterized by one side of the lips rising further than the other, the smirk is often associated with cheeky humor or humor at the expense of another.<br>  A grin on the other hand is a large, tooth-baring smile associated with everything from genuine humor to game-show hosts.|`|cYtPfXkJaa	A smirk is with your lips closed, so that your teeth aren't visible and usually one side of your mouth creeps up.<br>  <br>  A grin is a full on smile, showing your teeth.|`|d8c8117f48ac402f472ce028f62144a2aa	a smirk is when your sneeky, a grin is when your happy. ismirk more than grin|`|oX8TdFwSaa	A smirk is a cheeky smile and a grin is a smile as if you have a good idea|`|h6V7AtBvaa	WHEN YOU KNOW SOMTHING ABOUT THE PERSON YOU ARE TALKING TO AND THEY HAVE NO CLUE YOU KNOW THIS SECRET|`|URZeQfQCaa	idk but i used to get detention for merely walking into class with a smile on my face. very rude of them now i think of it.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	a smirk isn't on your face as long as a grin is.|`|zUFdTyqZaa	Top Cat, i have no idea.
dFacbjIZaa	Out of 100?<br>  <br>  I am going to go with a good solid 75/100. They were a very good Band in My opinion.|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	As one of my old teachers used to call it, a gentleman's "C" which would put them somewhere in the high 70's range.  <br>  <br>  The band I would've liked to have seen and heard more from was Tom Tom Club.  Peter Gabriel called and said you guys should be a tad more prolific.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXOrbR6mocs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXOrbR6mo...</a><br>  <br>  Bet you thought I was going to post Genius of Love, eh?  HA!<br>  <br>  James M - I hear that!|`|5uvTte8Zaa	I saw them live in '83 and loved it.<br>  When they came out they were a breath of fresh air. Just weird enough to make them unique, but not so weird they turned me off. I've since grown tired of their stuff, but that's not their fault. <br>  For the "new wave" genre, I give them a solid 90.<br>  Overall, musically compared to EVERYTHING else out there, they get a 75.|`|7dbWSo9xaa	Creativity - 100<br>  Songs - 75<br>  Influence - 90|`|AA11573840	80|`|DnWsMhwLaa	92.363849|`|1iqeWBisaa	65 out of 100.....like much of their catalog but not all.<br>  <br>  Would give bonus points for the Tom Tom Club.|`|1ViGcF3xaa	I'd give them a solid 80!|`|056498edf4de547ae040dec236229ec3aa	Around about 70.<br>  <br>  Many of the bands I listen to, in particular Radiohead, have acknowledged them as an inspiration form- even for Radiohead's name itself.<br>  <br>  I think True Stories is a brilliant album and certainly discourage the statement [not that you're making it] that only well-known bands or, indeed, music is worthwhile.|`|adLSRFrZaa	B+ = 88/100<br>  <br>  I think Talking Heads made some amazing albums.  They helped create much of the Post-Punk/New Wave sound and style.|`|wTkvkWscaa	97/100<br>  <br>  They are one of my favorite bands. And I love that song you posted.|`|FE9v3JRRaa	I actually love them- 89ish- but I can understand why they don't rock everybody. Superb vid!|`|AGP2dI6uaa	They get a 99/100.  Nobody gets a 100.  Talking Heads rule though.|`|7nkQyM0Laa	I only like Remain In Light album and the one with Brian Eno-My Life in Bush of Goats. And a few other songs, but I can live without them.|`|43iywBGSaa	5|`|O5KOwhovaa	150|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	F.  For fail....sorry :(|`|AA11166769	I would give them a 90. I especially like "Burning Down the House" and "Life During Wartime".|`|aKBqMLuhaa	I love them. You can ask me about them anytime.<br>  They are great to clean the house to... upbeat and motivating.<br>  <br>  My favorite right now is Stay Up Late.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, I'd rank them at about a 90.|`|htxwTAAQaa	I'd give them about an 80.  They made some amazing music in the late 70's and early 80's.  They lose points for some of the cheesier 80's stuff and because David Byrne is a bit of a prick.<br>  <br>  See: Fear of Music|`|iIWWeD7Taa	They are greatly underrated, especially the early years 1977-1981.  I would rate them at about 78. On the Rock History Heirarchy, they are above Peter Frampton but below Jethro Tull.|`|euZRbiA2aa	Liked some songs didnt like others so 50 out of 100.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I'd go somewhere in the 85-90 range. I think they're pretty friggin amazing.
ZWp23ujeaa	By itself, it sucks, with The Exorcist movie, it's awesome!|`|dFacbjIZaa	Offended, No. Rong, Quite.|`|AA11166769	I actually like Tubular Bells, but no, I wouldn't be offended, since I don't expect the whole world to share my tastes.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Yes you are wrong and I am offended that you do not like everything I like.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Ah! <br>  Insulting one of my favourite artists, you swine!<br>  <br>  No, honestly, I appreciate that, for some, Mike's work is a matter of personal taste. <br>  Personally, I *love* that album, but then, it is one I grew-up on.<br>  <br>  I know it has had a lot of 'over-use', especially the opening extract of part one, and that for a lot of people it will always be associated with every 'horror cliche' going. <br>  But, for me, it is a timeless classic. <br>  <br>  I am curious as to *why* you don't like it...?<br>  <br>  <br>  Yet again, the R&P village idiot proves he can only read the first line...<br>  <br>  <br>  Captain Futility :<br>  Although Mike was 20 when he recorded it, he was only 18 when he composed it!<br>  <br>  "And last... Tubular Bells"|`|AA12301664	why should i be offended? there's no personal malice intended, is there?<br>  <br>  but i think you are horribly wrong.<br>  not only is it a truly remarkable record, in both scope and sound, but the reverberations of an extremely talented 20 year old's vision are still being felt today.<br>  a record i don't even need to play to listen to because its burned into my head.<br>  in the words of the late viv stanshall,<br>  <br>  mandolin!|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Mike Oldfield is one of my favorite artist and Tubular Bells is one of my favorite songs of all time. I would not be offended by your opinion. Everyone has the right to express their taste, first off you are not putting me down or anyone else so I can't be offended<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	You know... I'd be okay with it. (Sorry, Silver!!)<br>  <br>  That was one of those albums that a close friend had and loved back when it was new and we were 20-year old roommates... Long story short, I saw it in the used CD bin so and bought it. Played it once; thought: what was I thinking??; and sold it back to the record store I got it from. And this was only about 3-4 months ago, so yeah...

MfzJROnJaa	he turned white.|`|1H7Z3Pivaa	He just stood out.  He had that extra factor. The others can sing and dance like everybody else but he sang and dance like nobody else even if he was copying his idols like James Brown and others. He has the trademark voice and groove that you'll just recognize its him. He seems effortless when he does this and not contrived which gave him the extra stellar points. Some would book the brothers for shows but only if Michael will perform with them. They know the appeal he brings to the show.

The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly, but he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791, and degenerated into chaos less than a year later. In the words of the 1911 Encyclop?dia Britannica[citation needed]: "In the attempt to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. It left behind an empty treasury, an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and successful riot."[page number needed] The Legislative Assembly consisted of about 165 Feuillants (constitutional monarchists) on the right, about 330 Girondists (liberal republicans) and Jacobins (radical revolutionaries) on the left, and about 250 deputies unaffiliated with either faction. Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the émigrés with death and that decreed that every non-juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Over the course of a year, disagreements like this would lead to a constitutional crisis, leading the Revolution to higher levels.|`|6nq1IiqXaa	lmao yea i have, when i used to hide the eater eggs around the house for my little one there was always 8 and i forgot where the other 2 where hehe|`|a6kZ2q8Kaa	Initially it always the wife's fault then when I find the missing article I realize that I put it there for safe keeping - sorry girls!|`|FqIuY6Qcaa	That 'safe place' I've hidden something always ends up being really safe because even I can't remember or find where it is.|`|8sxD1qUBaa	Haha! do i ever remember where i hid something?|`|BCIfeHAqaa	Yeah, because i hid it.

UZ9SyQdsaa	Slim to none<br>  <br>  They are fringe characters when it comes to mainstream things.  There is no way you could explain who X-man, Nate Grey, is in a movie and expect regular folks to accept and understand it.  Parallel time lines, alternate futures, and survivors from the aforementioned who get stranded in normal time is a hard storyline to sell.|`|LGBO4V4naa	100% No for Wolverine Origins<br>  <br>  If the Acolytes make an appearance in Magneto Origins then there is a chance Exodus will show up...<br>  <br>  I don't see Nate Grey in the mix... that would require an Age of Apocalypse Storyline... or something to that effect.. I would put money on Cable being in a movie first and that won't be in X-Men First Class either. <br>  <br>  I am sorry but it looks like you are going to have to wait a long while before you see them on live screen, especially considering they have not even made appearances in animated series.

ak610Npjaa	If u said something to hurt his/her feelings or did anything to upset them the best thing to do is give them time to cool of and when they are over it which shouldn't take more than a couple of hours depending on what u did they will call like nothing happen.<br>  <br>  if its been more than a couple of days and u didn't do anything they probably just needs their space.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|Wiwv6iZeaa	what is your sign?|`|ajzdsUldaa	Once an Aquarius ignores you, you are screwed.

IFf5r9zAaa	1) ?uest<br>  2) Very overused. People use it to apply to a rapper who's new album they don't like, or someone who is just trying something new and I think that's pretty unfair to the artist. Fickle fans. <br>  3) Hmm. Gotan Project. Some rapping over that electro-tango stuff would be awesome. Although I'm probably the only person who would listen to it. <br>  4) It makes me want to wear a pencil skirt and smoke cigarettes through a cigarette holder. <br>  5) Quite a bit. Tupac and IT get some unfair hate because of their stans making them out to be better than they are. If teenage girls listen to you, people don't see you as "real"... etc etc etc. <br>  <br>  BQ: Roots type thing. Because then you can make heavier stuff if you want because you'll already have a more experimental sound.|`|KoNHUcNUaa	1. Questlove<br>  2. It's justified<br>  3.Yeah (Ice Cube and Korn)<br>  4.Nice<br>  5.40%<br>  <br>  Bonus : Mix it all|`|aJfBtT9iaa	1. Quest love<br>  2. used justly imo<br>  3. Collision Course wasnt bad but no i dont <br>  4. Old but tight<br>  5. Contributes alot<br>  <br>  like The Roots, i hate metal.|`|os6FaEBlaa	1. ?uestlove<br>  2. Not really I only use on certain mainstream rappers.<br>  3. Yes, Radiohead & Prolyphic would be dope.<br>  4. Smooth<br>  5. About 50%<br>  <br>  BQ: Funk/Soul/Jazz Fusion or mix 'em both like Funk/Metal like RHCP but add everything you can to it be experimental.<br>  <br>  Name: Artistic Verisimilitude|`|rEqHeTY5aa	?uest Love<br>  It is used justly<br>  Sometimes<br>  No thanks<br>  huh?<br>  <br>  bonus: how about (be different) & a little bit of both?<br>  <br>  irritating/cool? how is that even possible? How can someone be both? I think I see what you're saying... For instance, 99% of Lil Wayne's fans are uneducated, adolescent, absent minded teens & tweens. And yes, because so many of them fools talk & talk & talk about him like he is a rap god... Yes, that makes me dislike his music that much more.|`|4DSGgOCXaa	1. HARD.. ?uest Love I guess, but I've heard some crazyyyy sh!t from Barker.<br>  2. Somewhat overused, but often used justly. Both kinda.<br>  3. I don't think any band could beat Collision Course. Linkin Park was a perfect match.<br>  4. No volume on my computer..<br>  5. I'd say about 70%, it's a shame more people don't have appreciation of real music.<br>  <br>  Whichever you're better at. Both can be incredible genres..|`|HL8W9yU6aa	1. ?uest<br>  2. Selling Out is overrated (which also happens to be an overused term)<br>  3. Yup, System Of A Down and MF DOOM<br>  4. trying to overcome a painful experience<br>  5. 27.7%<br>  <br>  Bonus: There are too many bands trying to be like Rage, and nobody like the Roots...<br>  <br>  Call It: Capstrumentals and the Disaster|`|u8hsZ7claa	1. ?uest Love<br>  2. Overused and should be retired<br>  3. yes, but to many to name at the moment<br>  4. magical<br>  5. 5%<br>  <br>  Bonus: make it whatever you feel and call it something memorable.|`|9DnsnEyraa	1) My initial inclination would be to say ?uest Love, but I don't listen to enough Travis Barker to say that it is or isn't him.<br>  <br>  2)Selling out is quite overused these days. Unfortunately, I feel that most rappers are already entering with the mainstream stigma, so they don't even have a chance to "sell out." Most indie artists, even if they enter the mainstream, stick to a particular style for the most part minus The Black Eyed Peas and a few others.<br>  <br>  3) No, collision course was a perfect fit between the two groups. As of now, I can't see any group being able to match up with a particular artist. Maybe Lil Wayne with Fall Out Boy or something lol.<br>  <br>  4) Coltrane is off the hook. Jazz, in our generation, is underrated.<br>  <br>  5) I believe that the fanbase contributes to a VERY HIGH extent. I base many of my opinions on a new artist just by the attraction they are getting from the people around me. For example, I thought I would like Asher Roth, simply because several of my college friends enjoyed his music. However, when I listened to him I wasn't overly impressed, which shocked me because I usually trusted the opinions of my peers on something like that.<br>  <br>  B.Q) Go with a hip-hop/alternative type band. I think that type of music is one that makes an impact between several audiences, and not just hip-hop.|`|yT6Mezweaa	1.As much as I love Blink 182, I have to go with Quest Love, I think he is the superior drummer.<br>  <br>  2. Somewhat.. I think a lot of people use it unjustly if a rapper changes up his style or makes his music more appealing to the mainstream.<br>  <br>  3.I would like to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers do a colab.<br>  <br>  4. I can't watch the video (in school)<br>  <br>  5. A LOT, just as an example, I think the Jonas Brothers are horrible, but their fans make them that much worse.<br>  <br>  Bonus Q: Do your own style or whatever feels good for you.<br>  <br>  How about Motu for a name lol|`|6fxr3VBGaa	1. ?uest love<br>  2.  overused<br>  3. No<br>  4. i'm sampling it<br>  5. 74.69%<br>  <br>  Bonus: Make it as unique as you can without doing something no one but you would like.|`|gUYcVXMTaa	1) ?uest<br>  2) Yes It is Overused!!<br>  3) Yes I am a big fan of hip hop and rock coming together!!!<br>  4) Lets just say that was a little before my time and Im old as heck LOL<br>  5) It would depend on the artist!  Some are open to feedback and wll take it and make changes according to what the fans would like to hear/see!  While the other more arrogant artist are like F them ima do me!  Kanye is a great example for that!<br>  <br>  Bonus Q: Why cant you make it a little of it all!  hip hop/alternative/metal/ funk/soul/jazz!  That would be hot!  Have a hip hop song on track 1 alternative/metal song on track 2 jazz on 3 funk on 4 soul on 5!!  Man I would buy it that for sure!  Call yourselves a little of it all!!!
3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	At times yes. It's pretty hard to talk to someone who doesn't like to talk about things that need discussed so I write a letter or a few letters but they never get sent. If nothing else, my head is clearer because I said my piece so to speak.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	I haven't written a letter in nearly forty years.

AA10607821	He wasn't raised right for hitting her and she wasn't raised right for taking him back.<br>  <br>  The only reason I would go back to a man that hit me would be to beat the hell out of him and then leave.|`|D5aZ2qTpaa	i cant believe she has anything to do with him after i saw this picture of her after getting beat up <a href="http://www.graphicshunt.com/upload/images/rihanna_bruises,-15907.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.graphicshunt.com/upload/image...</a>  for anyone who hasnt seen this, it will make you think twice about chris brown|`|do8pdlluaa	I hate chris brown. I hope he goes to jail.<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1535097/chris_browns_day_in_court_brown_charged.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	I think he should go to jail and even if she stays with him and thinks he will change he wont. I no longer feel sorry for Rihanna because she went back to him.|`|7HSi9sQFaa	Honestly just getting up and leaving is much easier said then done. She clearly loves him and wants to try and make it work. Most women who are in abusive relationships don't just get up and leave because they know how much they have invested in that person and how much that person truly loves them. And the women who do end up leaving do it as a last resort because after trying for a long time to make it work they realize it just won't . Don't judge that person until you've walked a mile in their shoes that's what i always say and it applies very heavily in this situation. Its their business and none of us will ever truly know what happened or what is going on.|`|1R5lLWYPaa	And now Star magazine is reporting that they've apparantly married in secret. <br>  If that is the case, I am speechless.<br>  Stupid is as stupid does, I guess.|`|JVUsliRGaa	As an online ad for a spam iq test so eloquently put it,<br>  Rihanna scored a 114, <br>  Can you beat her?<br>  My response<br>  "Yes Chris Brown can"|`|tC02KPckaa	Well first of all I really don't like Rhianna, but the fact that she got beat is really sad. But i am kinda of mad that any women would go back to the person who beat her. I would not go back to a man that beats me. But there has to be more to the story. And if he beats her again. I am sorry but that is her fault for going back to him.|`|AA11399475	I strongly believe that if a female hit's a guy she BETTER be prepared to get hit back. A guy has a right to defend himself. I find it very ignorant that some women hit up on guys because they THINK that guys don't have a right to get hit back.<br>  <br>  As for Chris Brown and Rihanna I don't know the whole story. It doesn't say whether or not Rihanna hit him first. I think the whole 'getting back together' thing is stupid as hell thou. Seriously. How can you be that stupid.
5c32c20454730c4d102bcfbf98334674aa	Nothing. They just filled the timeslot with their usual programming, which means some sort of reality show. The ratings were never the same once Carson Daly left.
7Nnbj1mCaa	No, we're the most sarcastic. I turn a lot of ppl off w my eagerness to insult ppl. I LOVE it when I get reactions, so that I can reply. When someone responds it triggers this warrior in me. Especially when I'm bored or dont even know the person, or I cause a scene, or if it's a friends- friend he/she is introducing me to for the first time. It blows ppl's minds when I'm rude out of the blue.<br>  <br>  I absolutely swell up w pride when ppl give me titles, like: You are a straight up *****! or how about this one: they exclaim "you are mean" then after that they always act awkward around me bc they think I'm crazy or sth, idk. I get cold-hearted and jerk. I make ppl cry, it's awesome!! :)|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Capricorn is usually more sarcastic than Scorpio. Sometimes Virgo. <br>  <br>  Really, the sharpest tongue belongs to Mercury in Scorpio:<br>  <br>  Tyra Banks<br>   John Cleese<br>  Richard Dreyfuss<br>  Whoopi Goldberg<br>   Sinead O'Connor<br>  Puff Daddy<br>  Hillary Clinton<br>  Richard Prior<br>  <br>  <br>  IMHO, the Mercury in Virgo also has a pretty sharp tongue, too.|`|R2hbZi1Faa	Capricorns,for sure. And I'm not a Capricorn, my sister is. About almost every Capricorn I know is sarcastic.|`|O0qLRXGGaa	Leo's and....Maybe Gemini's???|`|AA12215623	Sagittarius and Capricorn.|`|wpg6zTMQaa	No, scorpio is the worst. I have a very hard time controlling it. Sometimes though I just have to go off.|`|wmNXRnPnaa	aquarius|`|ObwsBIpMaa	aries...............the most|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Not because I'm a Virgo, but I think Virgo is also pretty sarcastic. Virgo's also have a clever wit. I also have Scorpio rising, so I guess that makes me doubly sarcastic. But overall, I think Virgo, Taurus, and Scorpio are pretty sarcastic, Earth and Water signs.|`|plBXp91Daa	Sarcastic Leo, a friend of mine said that i can be sarcastic sometimes lol<br>  So does Virgo's  my own experience.|`|33AW5DLdaa	Nooo of course theres not. *sarcastic voice, raises eyebrow*<br>  lol :D I don't know tbh maybe taurus?|`|4T9fZzITaa	hm maybe idk you tell me<br>  lol <br>  to answer your question.. possible & probable|`|MtANnIlfaa	Capricorn.|`|4YnoykD2aa	Taurean women.

OBwqjS8maa	I like your choices. As long as Anoop gets it I'm cool, but I really like Megan too. I about had a heart attack last night. If they HADN'T picked Anoop, I'd have been really upset. Plus, he's friends with a good friend of mine so I REALLY hope he goes far!|`|gIjnoEi5aa	As others have said, as long as Anoop makes it that all I care about.  I was really upset when Michael beat him out for the 3rd spot of group 1 (Michael had the next highest amount of votes since Alexis Grace and Danny Gokey were the highest voted contestant in their gender). Now, Michael IS very likable, but Anoop has a MUCH stronger voice. I just wish he had chosen a song other than, "Angel of Mine," because it didn't show his amazing vocal ability. After Anoop's initial audition I searched for clips of him on You Tube and I found out that he sang in an all male a cappella (sp?) group for the University of North Carolina. After watching those clips it made me want him to succeed even more.Therefore, I'm going to pray that he makes it tonight in the wild card round because I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to see him in the top 12!<br>  <br>  As for Jasmine Murray, Jesse Langseth, Matt Giraud, Megan Joy Corkrey, Ricky Braddy, Tatiana Nicole Del Toro and Von Smith...I guess it doesn't really matter to me.  However, I COULD see Jasmine, Matt and Von in the top 12.  I could even see Tatiana there because she MAY just be put through since she's a drama queen and drama sells in television.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens tonight.|`|jUg9HAOjaa	Well,<br>  <br>  There are already 6 boys, and only 3 girls so far, so, hopefully, at least two girls will go through.<br>  <br>  Based on her previous performance I don't think Jasmine Murray has any chance...and I hope she doesn't make it through.<br>  2 spoilers is more than enough (Michael Sarver and Scott Macintyre)<br>  <br>  Jesse Langseth , Simon doesn't like her, so although I really like the tone of her voice I think there's very  little chance that she'll make the top 12. She would really have to blow Simon's socks off.<br>  <br>  They all like Megan, because she's commercial, so I think she'll sail through. She's not my favorite, but I kind of like her.<br>  <br>  Now, Tatiana might go through if she picks the right song and sings as good as last time or even better. I really think she's the dark horse tonight. I am happy for her that she is given a fair chance.<br>  <br>  As for the boys,<br>  <br>  They all like Matt Giraud. So if he picks the right song I believe he will be the one going through.<br>  <br>  Ricky Braddy has a great voice, but Simon finds him forgettable. <br>  <br>  Anoop, great voice...maybe if he choses the right song. I'm not sure that Simon thinks he's got enough charisma though.<br>  <br>  Von Smith...nah<br>  I would never listen to him.<br>  I think it wasn't fair to Ju' Not Joyner to pick him. <br>  Although it might be because Ju' Not has had asthma problems.<br>  <br>  Personally I'd like to see:<br>  Jesse Langseth<br>  Tatiana Del Toro<br>  Ricky Braddy<br>  or Matt Giraud if he picks the right song for his voice.<br>  <br>  What I think will happen:<br>  Megan Joy Corkery<br>  Matt Giraud<br>  Anoop/ Ricky/ Jasmine|`|EDXh0tk9aa	As long as Anoop gets in, I don't care who the other 2 are.|`|pKpJj7ftaa	I agree with your choices - they're definitely going to choose two girls. They'll want to try to even things out between girls and guys. The only sure way to do that would be to pick three girls, but then they would be exposing the whole "set-up" process that they try so hard to keep under wraps.<br>  I would like to see Anoop, Megan and Ricky. Ricky has a great voice but has been underplayed too much in favor of more "exciting" (commercial) contestants. He is the only one in the wildcard group (besides Anoop) that actually sang their song very well but just didn't get the votes. He deserves another chance, whereas the other wildcard selections sang terribly and do not. Except maybe Tatiana, but I cannot bring myself to want her to advance. She makes my fingers curl into fists and inadvertantly punch whoever is sitting next to me. Be it a child, a nun... it doesn't matter.|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	I really think it will all depend on the performances they give tonight. If they choose the wrong songs for their voice again and/or don't make a great impression, the ones who do will go through. I think at this point, it's still anyone's game. That being said, i really hope Megan, Anoop and either Ricky or Matt gets out there and kicks some major ***!! And if Tatiana makes it through, i may just have to quit watching lol.|`|HjUZR9wVaa	I agree with the person above, as long as Anoop is in, I'm more than happy. TEAM JORGE DANNY ANOOP! Lol.

Some may sense your need of human touch, some may do it as a type of friendship act, and others simply are in need of human touch, so if no one touches them, they reach out and pat a shoulder. some respond to what you are telling them with a shoulder pat, as if to say that you are not alone, or to say that the person feels compassion for you. if the touch becomes uncomfortable for you, you need to be direct and tell that person to stop because you are not comfortable with it.|`|ulxe0jPZaa	Sounds terrible, best call in swat to deal with this one.|`|vja4ddNmaa	Additional details are required for answering this question.|`|ZrjGrFwzaa	You just need the attention

N7PHiWn3aa	this is how i see it.  i think that he made a big mistake proposing to Melissa when he said and i quote "i'm in love with two women". if you're in love with two women why do you need to let one go and propse to spend the rest of your life to another woman.  there is a big problem there.Also he cried when he let Molly go then turned around and proposed to Melissa. i think that's a sign not to go through a proposal. i would like to say, a propsal is supposed to be serious and you're not supposed to just jump into it lightly.  His reason for proposing to Melissa was to see how things go. what the heck? you don't propose to see how things will go with someone, you propose because you are sure without a doubt that this is someone that you see yourself spending forever with.  that is a bunch of baloney. <br>  <br>  i personally would never go on the bachelor because in the end you are putting all of your emotions and attention on some man that may hurt you because he's dating like 10 other women at the same time.  i personally may watch the bachelor again because it reminds of what not to do when it comes to dating.  Women need to guard their hearts and be careful on how they throw themselves into another mans hands.  My mother said what makes Molly think that she will not go through the same thing again with Jason when he suddenly starts to get doubts again.  I say before you make a decision actually think about it and don't just force yourself to make a decsion to be with someone for the sake of tv.  this reminds me of one of the bachelors who was ridiculed for not picking Deanna or the other girl.  he was honest and didn't lead both of them on but yet many viewers criticized him for not taking a chance on  so called love.  Deanna was pissed that he didn't choose her but yet she did the very same exact thing to Jason, and actually visited him to get him back. it's crazy.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	It is & always has been, of the dumbest shows ever!!!|`|aboQfYqeaa	I never cared for the show since its beginning, but one of my nieces got me into it.

I really don't have a hard-set opinion on whether rock should be used for this purpose or not.

NQ37mnWkaa	Personally, I don't define it by songs, but by the dates of band origin. <br>  <br>  So, bands & artists who originated between 1960 - 1979 are, for me, 'Classic Rock'.|`|AQwoCjj3aa	I guess I would say 60's. <br>  Alternative rock was in the 80's/90's the beginning of it anyway.|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Probably the late 60s or early 70s, but just about everything from 1950-1970 could be in the "rock and roll" oldies category and not the "classic rock" category. Although some stuff like Eric Clapton and Stepenwolf could be either oldies or classic rock.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Classic rock is a timeless term that is constantly gaining more songs in its repertoire. So classic rock began when rock began, in the 50's.|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	I'd say the 60s. I consider the 50s to be more in the oldies category. Even if it did all start there.|`|zM9Lj21waa	in my mind the mid 60's , post beatle era...|`|kssArYTVaa	I'd say the 70s is when classic rock began. Most classic rock such as Supertramp, America, Trooper, Streetheart, B.T.O., etc. started around the 70s. In the 50s I'd say it would be oldies and the 60s "psychedelic rock" because for some reason the 60s was kind of "hazy" for people living in that time, what with hippies, weed, mushrooms and the psychedelic rock that rooted from that time. 80s would be classified as "bubblegum music" because it sounds a bit more cheaper and "pop-ish" than classic rock. It also introduces electric instruments such as the early drum machines without using actual physical instruments.<br>  <br>  90s is becoming a bit more modern, I'd say. But in my opinion, classic rock began in the 70s and I suppose you can say the 80s included classic rock as well, because not all of it was "bubblegum music".

TCQP2iShaa	I agree with you, I think it is the worst possible example for young women. I have absolutely no connection to Rihanna whatsoever but in some ways, I've lost a little respect for her. I sympathize for her because she obviously must have some sort of psychological issues that she urgently needs to attend to but on the other hand I think she is dumb (nicest word I can use) to go back to her abuser. I myself have never been physically abused so I am in no frame of mind to say what she is possibly thinking or feeling, but it's just so hard for me to comprehend why she would stay with him? And not only that, but marry him as well! I don't know if this is true as I only saw this from TMZ and that's not the most reputable site, but I hope that she has enough sense to seek the counseling she needs and for whatever Chris Brown deserves as his punishment, I don't know what that may be but I hope he gets that as well and deals with his issues too.|`|0QqFd23Saa	Who gives a flying ****?they both fail in life,anyway.|`|7hZLgQOMaa	Who knows what's true and what's not true with Rihanna and Chris Brown anymore. Rihanna is a moron for going back to a man who beat the crap out of her... even if she was pregnant with his child does she honestly want her child to grow up with THAT for a dad? I agree with you, she is a horrible role model for young girls. The fact that she might have even got married to CB proves her infatuation has reached ridiculous heights.... if he beat her once what makes her think he won't strike again?? There were rumors saying that this wasn't the first time he beat her... she apparently came to a photo shoot for a magazine and had bruises on her neck. When asked about them she dismissed the question and the bruises were covered with make up.<br>       I have lost all respect for the both of them, CB for his cruelty and abusive actions and Rihanna for her stupidity for going back to him. I think that CB has truly brainwashed her into thinking that he is her one and only, that she needs him which is utterly ridiculous... no woman needs a man to complete her. I think CB's career is pretty much in the toilet... he has lost so many fans and I for one refuse to support him in any way. Rihanna was the victim of the situation so it's hard to not support her but it is insane of her to be with CB again. And now she might be pregnant with his child and married to him?! Geez.... I could go on and on....|`|EkPRq4JPaa	I heard both. Chris proposed to Rihanna just a while ago, and magazine's and the TV say She's pregnant. <br>  <br>  I'm not exactly sure about the whole arrangement, but sure that both of those are correct.<br>  <br>  I may be wrong though ?? :-)|`|VAqD392Baa	Pregnant aye and i heard she got married to <br>  <br>  Im soz but chris dont se em like ke would hit her i dont think it is true i think she got drunk and got in a fight wants the money so she is blaming chris|`|Zb6uZDIyaa	i dont know about marrige but Rihanna is pregnat|`|LxXOCfHraa	Who cares I don't...they could kill each other for all I care.<br>  So which one of them are you planning on stalking?

xjv02joXaa	As a radio DJ here is my advice. If they pick up the phone and ask you to hold or ask you your name, make it sound like you are going to give them great audio.

28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Kristen Stewart does not want anything to do with the Twilight Franchise. She recently was quoted saying that she wants to just drop out of the series altogether, and that it would make 'millions of little girls cry' if she did.

They will tell you if you can sing or not!|`|mEMRv3MVaa	I would go for it. Take voice lessons. Not only do they help you know how to sing well, but they help you build confidence and be able to sing in front of people. I would just tell your parents that you are really interested. As for finding vocal coaches, I would ask any of your friends who are great singers or who are taking voice lessons. They might have a great coach who can also help you.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! :)|`|7LrbrCwiaa	Well, if you want lessons or change your voice, do a ton of vocal exercises, and if you love singing so much, and you want to take these lessons, come clean with your parents all the way. Tell them how much you love it. I have performed in Talent Shows and at the mall, and now i'm working on a demo CD, so I'm a Professional.

hIrBZS3oaa	If a 19 year old guy has to be with a 15 year old girl, there is something wrong with the 19 year old guy.  Why can't he get with a 19 year old girl?  There's something wrong with him.|`|PpWosZsIaa	If you are 15, and he is 19, then he goes to jail for inappropriate contact with a minor albeit you consented. Your Parents will have him tossed under the jail.|`|G4wDlSh7aa	it's not a big deal nowadays.<br>  guys aren't as mature as girls so he might want a younger girl who's at the same mind set as him.<br>  but who really knows, he Might just wanna get some booty.<br>  but i wouldn't get in the way if i were you, you could end up losing her as a friend.<br>  just mind your own business.<br>  :)|`|4WCLWhaTaa	A difference between the age of wine and the age of a steak is very right...<br>  The age between Michael Jackson and a school boy is very very wrong...<br>  <br>  Those were circumstances. Do you real need more details on bad meat?<br>  <br>  The question is moot. In every state I know of, the age of fifteen is still under the age of consent. Thus its against the law. If its against the law it shouldn't be practiced. Pretty cut and dry to me. <br>  If the girl were 19 and the boy 23 he would still likely only be after one thing but we wouldn't be having this conversation about it...|`|AA10269742	just leave her alone...chances are that she wont listen no matter what you say, so she'll just have to find out the hard way|`|FSyaAnuKaa	Well, first of all it's illegal (if they're having sex)|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Love is love. Get used to it.|`|AA11227341	a young girl can easily fall for a guy because she is motivated by her ideas about love and a "need" to be loved and that is normal to want someone in our live but an older guy knows this too and here is the issue, he tends to take advantage of this vulnerability and he gets all the sex he can get from her,  sure there are some good guys but the majority are dogs with sex in the brain.   <br>  There are situations where girls get trapped, fall in love with an older guy who in return sells her after he gets his way with her---puts her in the streets of course this is not the norm but it happens.  So a young girl needs to be firm and not fall for the "if you don't give me sex I'm breaking up with you, or if you love me have sex with me, or you don't want to have sex with me because you have someone else and others of this nature--to convince her that he needs sex or its all over.  <br>  Guys, once they get what they want--many like to take a girl's virginity or just have sex act differently after wards so the girl will feel that she is the one with the problem but what the guy is looking for is a reason to break it off--"you are too jealous, you are always on my back" or I can wait till you are ready." <br>  Age does make a difference .|`|kg6H6HDuaa	Age shouldn't matter unless you can go to jail for being with that person physically and you know she is going to do what she wants to do no matter what you tell her or what we tell you.  Just know that when he achieves his real intentions you will have to be there for her as a friend to help pick up the pieces|`|zAAeLFLuaa	Yeah, call tyra lol jaykayy ;P<br>  I think its wrong because he's gonna be 20 and <br>  technically he is an adult already (18 is considered legal in some states)<br>  And she's only 15. Maybe he's trying to stay a kidd and thinks he's younger than what he is. But then again, boys do have a slower maturity rate;|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	well that age difference is ok like when theyre older but now he only wants her THAT way and i'm serious...no 19 year old boy is interested in a girl that young for a respectful relationship|`|ZooBNBB5aa	OMG another kid|`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	He enjoys molding her and she is agreeable.  He still needs to obey the law.|`|yjvY2KX1aa	19 year old man with a 15 year old girl... that is statutory rape if he sticks his dipstick in her crankcase....|`|SxGLqfUTaa	In my experience of this kind, guys ages around 18-30 like younger girls becasue they like the idea of a innocent girl. They like to be the first with her. They like her pureness and naiveness when it comes to sex. And younger girls are incredibly devoted to their boyfriends. <br>  Guys aged 50 and up also like younger girls<br>  and guys aged 30-50 like girls older than them.<br>  <br>  ang girls just always like older guys because they are more mature. usually.|`|bS5cGrVgaa	ummm....It's not a matter of opinion....it's ILLEGAL! what more do you need to tell her? he could go to jail and be a sex offender for the rest of his life. The only reason he wants her is for THAT reason. at 15, her intellect is no where near a 19 year old. It would be different if she was 17 and he was 21....#1 IT'S NOT ILLEGAL...#2 she's more mentally capable of making better decisions and not letting someone take advantage of her.|`|AA12397532	When will the kids learn. Feel so sad for them. Once they face the realities of life, do you think this guy, who is making a lier out of her even now, will stick around. All he seems to be interested in is her - have her ... at any age...any cost|`|xJTMuHFNaa	As a teen, age matters a lot, mostly because of maturity (both mentally and physically), also social attitudes. <br>  <br>  Further along age matters less, or so claim the golddiggin' Playboy Bunnies who marry really, really old dudes.|`|nucQYOf3aa	It might not work out because, he might be going of to college and she would be in High School or where ever she is and it wouldn't be right for that to happen...!|`|AA11979300	Ohhh MAN<br>  just call Tyra, would yah!?!<br>  <br>  xD<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArpwHN1GbuEbmdjw3ZoJXATOxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090305083957AAFjoH3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|yq72XIhdaa	19 year old boys are only interested in one thing...sex.<br>  <br>  It's her mistake if she's stupid enough to willingly consent to having sex with this boy.
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I don't, but my mother does that all the time.  She'll see a movie, and won't like the character that an actor plays, and then she just ignores every other that actor is in as if 1 character in 1 movie is indicative of that actor's entire career, on and off the screen.<br>  <br>  Crazy.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Philip Seymour Hoffman - I can't stand him. And not because of his personal life which I don't know anything about - he just irritates me.|`|uap6JAqQaa	i wouldn't say i'd refuse to see movies with these actors, but i find jim carrey, nicolas cage, and christian bale all really annoying to watch.|`|AA10268618	Absolutely. I don't see movies with certain actors in it. Or directed by certain people, like ROman Polansky a child rapist.|`|y9Hkvn2Waa	Jason Biggs, Lindsay Lohan (except for The Parent Trap), and Paris Hilton are all horrible...I despise the kind of movies they are in!!!|`|EeGgovyCaa	It's not because I don't like them it's just because I see their faces splattered all over the place I don't want to see them on the big screen. Ex. would be Maria Carey and Beyonce.|`|Klk25W7Gaa	Off the top of my head, I can't think of any movies in particular that I've said "no way" to.  But, there are a few actors that I can't stand to watch, so I usually avoid their movies.  Like Christopher Walken.  Something about him just bothers me, lol.  (Although, I will watch certain movies with him in them)<br>  <br>  But there are actually very few actors I refuse to watch due to moral grounds....  Horrible, maybe, but I typically only avoid actors that bother me in some way.|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	It's not that I refuse to see the movies, but rather... it's just not high on my priorities  to go because I'm not a huge fan of the person. I have never seen a Russell Crowe movie, Colin Farrell movie, or Tom Cruise movie. I have seen movies where they happen to have a cameo, but never one where they were the main character. <br>  (Oh, duh, I have seen War of the Worlds. THAT'S IT)|`|pNY6xXb5aa	actors not so much, there are a lot of overrated actors: Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blancette etc...but it didn't stop me from seeing it...Directors on the other hand, I stay away from anything that involves Michael Bay, Uwe Boll, Eli Roth these guys have no idea what they are doing|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Yep!  I refuse to spend any money to see any actor/actress who has cheated on his/her spouse.  Examples:  Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie.  I also refuse to spend money to see Tom Cruise because he tries so hard to push his Scientology agenda on everyone else.|`|Cppi6kRFaa	I've come close. But I usually end up going at to be honest I'm usually not too let down. I have a hard time watching Keanu Reeves and Nick Cage. To me I always see Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Valley Girl! haha|`|Cv2h6n1Raa	Yea, anything with Lindsay Lohan. Except mean girls, but thats cause Tina Feys awesome and I think any other actress could have done the same as her, probably better.|`|P6fT0LBiaa	Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton|`|q6uyloYdaa	Yes. I won't go near any Julia Roberts movie. Or anything with Larry the Cable Guy.|`|rZQYCpabaa	Yes<br>  <br>  I can not stand Nicholas Cage.  The way he talks makes me want to each into the screen and just punch him. It's sort of like Owen Wilson who also talking in an annoying way only a million times worse.<br>  <br>  I refuse to watch anything w/ him in it.  He is so unbearable that even if it's the best movie ever made.. I won't be able to stand it.|`|AAjMQtzUaa	i wont watch any movies with angelina jolie cant stand her ...........|`|U5CLIhYgaa	Yes, I despise Hasselhoff and Seagal|`|ZZAPms1Raa	Yes, I now refuse to watch any movie with Tom Cruise.|`|etjZ7entaa	haha yea...<br>  tom cruise lol|`|n54adPiBaa	It's a main guideline of what I watch

A7ovwP94aa	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. That as absolutely hilarious. Here is one for you.<br>  <br>  Little Johnny and his father came across his puppy, dead in the back yard. Daddy explained that Buddy had gone to heaven.<br>  <br>  "So why are his legs sticking up in the air like that, Daddy?" asked Little Johnny, as he fought back tears. At a loss for something to say the father replied, "Buddy's legs are pointing straight up in the air so that it will be easier for Jesus to take him by the leg and lift him up to heaven."<br>  <br>  Little Johnny seemed to take Buddy's death quite well. However, two days later when his father came home from work, Little Johnny had tears in his eyes as he said, "Mommy almost died this morning." fearing something terrible had happened, his father questioned,<br>  <br>  "What do you mean Johnny? Tell Daddy!"<br>  "Well", mumbled Little Johnny, "Soon after you left for work this morning I saw Mommy lying on the floor with her legs in the air and she was shouting, 'Oh Jesus! I'm coming, I'm coming!' And, if it hadn't been for the neighbor who was holding her down, she would have gone to Heaven just like Buddy did."|`|UYutLWRraa	john shares a room with his lil brother and they have bunk beds and his lil bros on the bottom. well john brings home his old lady and there gettin hot and john tells her, "say lettuce if you want it harder, tamato if you want a new position."<br>  shes goin,<br>  LETTUCE!

He'd toss them in the air, then catch them in his mouth. In the middle of catching one, his wife asked a question, and as he turned to answer her, a peanut fell in his ear. <br>  <br>  He tried and tried to dig it out but only succeeded in pushing it in deeper. He asked his wife for assistance, and after hours of trying they became worried and decided to go to hospital. <br>  <br>  As they were ready to go out the door, their daughter came home with her date. After being informed of the problem, their daughter's date said he could get the peanut out. The young man told the father to sit down, then shoved two fingers up the father's nose and told him to blow hard. When the father blew, the peanut flew out. The mother and daughter jumped and yelled for joy. <br>  <br>  The young man insisted that it was nothing and the daughter brought the young man out to the kitchen for something to eat. Once he was gone the mother turned to the father and said, "That's wonderful. Isn't he smart? What do you think he's going to be when he grows older?!" <br>  <br>  The father replies "From the smell of his fingers, our son in-law!"

Jessica played Max, a genetically upgraded chick with a barcode tattoo and super-human abilities. The show became a big hit in its first season, but tanked in its second season, leaving Jessica Alba and her then-finace, Michael Weatherly, unemployed.

vDGFRACaaa	Pretty much. Daniel's mother (Eloise Hawking) used this crazy pendulum that determined how Jack and the others could get back to the island. They had to be in a certain spot (on a plane in the air) and it teleported the plane to the island.

10mOHSZTaa	I think that it's largely because many contemporary composers have no obligation to write music that people want to listen to. Many of them are dependent on government or university money, so they end up writing music that either only they want to hear (government) or only other professors will listen to (university).<br>  <br>  I saw a live performance of some Joelle Leandre pieces- played by Joelle Leandre herself, no less. I was fully open to it. I was actually expecting to like it. And at the end of the performance, nothing was communicated. Nothing even sounded particularly nice. And I wasn't alone in feeling this way- the entire group of people I was with (all high school juniors and seniors interested in music criticism) reached similar conclusions.<br>  <br>  While good music has depth and complex layers, it must also be understandable on some level by a listener without a guidebook. I've only been composing for a day (and nothing to show for it so far -_-") but my guiding philosophy about my music is already, "If you have some degree of musical sensitivity and are trying to understand my music, and you don't, then I've failed at my job."<br>  <br>  In music, the audience is who matters. Not the composer, not the performer. The audience. We musicians write and play because we want to evoke emotion and thought in other people. Whether we want to relax them, make them think, make them cry, make them dance...we want to incite something in them. Nobody makes a pilgrimage to a concert hall, or at least they shouldn't. When you're at a performance, assuming you're not related to one of the performers, you don't care what they're really feeling. When I saw Tristan and Isolde, I didn't care if the singers actually felt conflicted hatred, or actually fell in love, or actually went crazy. I can say that I honestly don't care if they're plotting to kill each other. The point is, they sang and acted convincingly enough to make me engage myself in the story and the music. Actually, I didn't even really particularly care about the actress playing Isolde when she ran offstage to puke.<br>  <br>  I of course would rather have a world where nobody gets sick, or feels bad, or has murderous plans. But the fact remains that the audience is what matters, not the people they're going to see.<br>  <br>  We've lost sight of that, and that's why contemporary music is dying.<br>  <br>  Besides, a lot of contemporary stuff isn't exactly easy on the ear, and I've had a hell of a time finding anything cheerful.<br>  <br>  Xenakis: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0URApoxPVY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0URApoxP...</a> (I'm getting used to this...it doesn't sound as grating as it used to.)<br>  <br>  Schnittke: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9c5MMb-XPE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9c5MMb-X...</a> (Good Lord...this is all sounding so easy on the ear to me now...)<br>  <br>  Ligeti: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZTaiDHqs5s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZTaiDHqs...</a><br>  <br>  Now, for the sake of comparison, a popular song. This is the top song on iTunes at the moment: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMpSfh7hQGc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMpSfh7hQ...</a><br>  <br>  The popular song is tonal. It has a melody that's easy to follow. It has a strong and undeniably catchy beat. If you really wanted to, you could whistle bits of this stuff later.<br>  <br>  That's what people want in music. Nobody who's telling the truth wants a strong emotional experience every time they listen to some music. Sometimes, I just listen to Beethoven's third string quartet because it makes me happy. I play some relatively simple Bach minuets because they're fun. I listen to Mozart chamber music because it's pretty. I listen to Shostakovich symphonies because I want to get pumped up. I also spend quite a lot of time getting wrapped up in my music. But nobody wants that all the time.<br>  <br>  When contemporary classical music can be listened to by an average person without causing minor schizophrenia on first exposure (should have seen me the first time I heard Schnittke) we'll win back the public ear.<br>  <br>  It does often seem like classical listeners like being the "last of a dying breed," or something like that. The New York Times editorialized against the Met filming operas and playing them in movie theaters. Apparently it will be the death of the genre. I mean, of course it will! Look at what happened to the Met after they started radio broadcasts! Oh, wait...<br>  <br>  People have always wanted instant gratification and stupid music, and there have always been other people willing to write it. If someone wrote something accessible and listenable, he'd find a wider audience than someone writing a piece about how she's a post-tonal lesbian.<br>  <br>  You want to get more people in to classical music? Find out what kind of music a friend of yours likes. Then see what you have that more or less fits the bill. I have a metalhead friend, so I gave her lots of Shostakovich and Prokofiev. She likes it a lot. I might move her on to Stravinsky soon.<br>  <br>  EDIT: What do you people mean, classical music was never pop music?! Of course it was! What else were people listening to before the 20th century? If I went to go buy some sheet music in 1870, what kind of music would I find? (Well, I'd find Romantic music, but you get my point.) There was what we now call classical music, and folk music. Opera was huge among those who could afford it.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	classical music (or what's considered that now, in the 17th century it was quite contemporary and modern, and many people no doubt thought it as bad for children as 1960s parents thought of the Beatles) is complex, requires an attention span of more than a few seconds to appreciate.<br>  And with the constant exposure to rapid fire TV programming, most people these days don't have an attention span of more than about 30 seconds (which is why politicians and marketing people rarely make statements that need longer than that to get the message across).<br>  <br>  Of course there is also the factor of most 'modern classical music' not being very good at all compared to the real classics like Bach and Mozart. Current 'composers' are often more posers, 'artistes' rather than artists, with a massively inflated self-image that far exceeds their talent.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	I think there are a number of reasons...<br>  <br>  First, the general public is now bombarded with commercial pop music. The whole pop music industry is based on marketing, not "musical substance." Never before do we have so many "one hit wonders." Throughout the hay day of rock music we had groups of musicians that had staying power... the Rolling Stones would be a good example. Now that genre is so played out, so instead we have a series of pop artists who are promoted based on their ability to sell. The almighty dollar has taken over.<br>  There is such an inondation of this stuff that nothing else much gets a look in.<br>  <br>  Secondly, very little modern art music is particularly good (awaits incoming salvos). There are few good contemporary classical composers. What few there are produce music that is only comprehensible to the cognescenti. They are appreciated in the halls of academia and few other places. Even with these, how many will stand the test of time remains doubtful.<br>  <br>  It seems our culture is currently rather stagnant in this respect and there are few champions that are likely to expand the listening audience because of the financial aspects of the music business.|`|WVLNcDXBaa	Well, most of the "classical" composers were not so appreciated at their time. Masterpieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky,<br>  etc were not acclaimed by the public and by critics at their time.<br>  <br>  A good reason could be: we like what we are used with. New things need some time to be understood. Maybe in some decades our contemporary music will be considered as beautiful as Prokofiev's music (for example) is today.<br>  <br>  Interesting question!|`|jR8kyp0Taa	I sat for a while trying to think of a proper response to this.

Times change. The younger generation has its own music. Even my generation, (tail end of the baby boomers)<br>  was less likely to be in to contemporary classical than the 30's and 40's generation. Take today's cars for example. Very few people drive around in cars from the 30's and 40's yet when they came out with the PT Cruiser, that started a trend until they went on to the next thing. Music appreciation is something that has to be passed on or else it won't continue to be as popular.|`|C4OIwfS3aa	Let me deal firstly with the wildly held ... and utterly mistaken ... view that composers have always been misunderstood or ignored by their contemporary audiences.  Mozart was world famous!  So were Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Wagner, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, Prokoviev, Shostakovich, Elgar, Vaughan-Williams, Britten, Gershwin, Barber, Copland, Bernstein etc etc etc?  Tchaikovsky toured the USA twice ... his first tour instigated by Andrew Carnegie (my fellow Scot!).<br>  <br>  As for the difficulty with modern composers ...  I honestly believe the problem was started by Shoeneberg and worsened by his pupils Berg and Webern.  Shoenberg's notion that tonality, streched to its limits by Wagner and Mahler, no longer had anything to offer has been proved a mistaken one but not before it had done much damage.<br>  <br>  When I began listeing to classical music in the 1960's modern composers were complaining that concert halls had become museums. They were wrong. If new music had appealed to its audience as 'old' music had appealled to it's audience then there would have been no problem.  But it didn't!<br>  <br>  I remember a music critic saying that, at the end of a concert who's last work had been 'modern' he made to leave the auditorium quickly, no doubt to get his piece in the mornings edition.  As he left the auditorium he heard a clatter of cymbals and presumed that an encore was being given.  He returned to the auditorium to discover that one of the percusion players had fallen amongst the instruments.<br>  <br>  Composers are entitled to expect some effort from their listeners.  They are not writing four minute juke box shakers which can be assimilated in as many minutes.  But they must make an effort to meet their listeners half way and they must not presume that all their listeners are musically literate.  If Mozart and Beethoven had presumed musical literacy in all of their audience they would have failed.  Mahler, for example, makes heavy demands upon his listeners; but he readily rewards their efforts.  Modern composers are entitled to make demands on their listeners too.  But they must be able to reward the effort.  Not all do.  Audiences want to love new music but plinks, plonks and cymbolic crashes simply do not inspire engagement.<br>  <br>  Someone, in reply to you, mentioned film composers.  they do a great job, many of them, and I love film music.  But it cannot, surely, be regarded ... even in the broadest sense ... as classical. And I'm sure John Williams et al would wholeheartedly agree with me.|`|qZOuxR1Raa	I think it's because they find it boring. To them it's kind of like watching a movie where every things happy and nobody has problems and every thing is perfect. It doesn't interest them. They want songs about drugs, sex, and money.

Have just put on a Bach "Prelude and Fugue" to help concentrate my mind - hopefully - to help post a response that may have some substance and meaning.<br>  <br>       "Scary", like in when for the past few months while watching the latest news, perceiving a world that seems to be coming apart at the seams, what would Herr Bach think about it; and what philosophical stance take, in order to deal with it - as I recall the firm commitment to his faith evident in every measure of his music(trust this may make a little sense-?).<br>  <br>       Unfortunately I guess, I don't share his faith; for what I perceive in most - not all - of contemporary music, is an utter spiritual desolation: populated by would be artist who seem to think the only way open to recogniztion, is to contrive an even more outlandish manipulation of a conglomerate of "sounds"(or just silence) no one else has yet attempted.<br>  <br>       Such wherein there's not the minimal suggestion of "song".  What do I mean by "song"?  I will undoubtedly fail in my attempt to define, but here's the best I can come up with.<br>  <br>       It's an impulse to replicate, "hum"-? - upon hearing.  A feeling to want to become "one with".  To ascertain and share with the composer that point at which he realized the intent of his creative desire.  <br>  <br>       To remember, so that at some future time the experience can be recalled, re-experienced and perhaps related to; in order to better relate and integrate what is occurring at the moment in ones daily life.<br>       I have by the way, switched to listening to the desolation, portrayed by the "Tristan" 3rd Act prelude. Much more appropriate for contemplating, trying to assess the value of contempory music.<br>  <br>                                                   Regretfully,<br>  <br>                                                            Alberich|`|dpYMlxA4aa	There has been a trend in most contemporary music to add resistance to music. To require active listening instead of passive listening to fully enjoy a piece of music. The idea of having to think during what many consider their leisure time is daunting to some.<br>  <br>  That is the contemporary composer is not interested in an audience that just wants to sit back and let the music happen to them. Instead they want a captively engaged audience that gets all the references, however obscure, they put in their music. they also expect the audience to have really good aural skills, an ability to recognize a theme that undergoes complex variations and transformations.<br>  <br>  Another way of looking at it is that many pieces of new music are in a foreign language. Such as much electronic music, spectralism, new complexity, serialism, etc. And asking someone to listen to these pieces is like asking someone who doesn't speak swahili to carry out a conversation in that language.<br>  <br>  Of course there is also another trend in contemporary music of composers who are avoiding these expectations, such as the minimalists and the "New simplicity" and the neo-classicists and neo-romantics. There are great composers among them as well. But even so they enjoy only slightly more recognition than the first group.<br>  <br>  I would disagree with your assertion that "never before have so few people enjoyed the music of the greatest composers of the day" we often forget that classical music has never been popular music. the widest audience it got was opera in the late 19th and early 20th century before recording technology and radio caught on.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	It's a mixture of things. During the 1950s and 1960s particularly, some composers showed a growing disregard for their potential audience. They assumed (expected!) too much knowledge, patience and resilience from their would-be audients. Some were so self-obsessed (and arrogant) with various experiments and blind alleys that audiences soon became alienated. This was the era of the famous 'squeaky gate music'. We have never really recovered from this.<br>  <br>  However, composers DID recover (and, remember, not ALL composers were guilty of the above sins) and from the 1970s onwards there was a rebirth of music that looked more fondly back to the roots whence it came.<br>  <br>  It annoys the hell out of me when people who do not explore 'contemporary' music (and EVERY composer who ever lived was a 'modern' or 'contemporary' composer at one time!) make glib statements suggesting that there is very little good music being written nowadays or that it is just silly noises and experiments in sound. One should remember that composers such as Monteverdi, Beethoven, Wagner, Stravinsky and Bartók were all accused of being crazy experimenalists at one time. But it is NOT the case. We are fortunate in having a greater wealth and variety of music being offered to us today than at any time in history. I know quantity does not equal quality but there are some VERY fine composers active today or in the very recent past who, I am confident, will be judged fairly by posterity. Composers such as:<br>  <br>  Kalevi Aho<br>  Sally Beamish<br>  Elisabetta Brusa<br>  Philip Cashian<br>  John Corigliano<br>  Michael Daugherty<br>  Henri Dutilleux<br>  Anders Eliasson<br>  Hans Werner Henze<br>  Vagn Holmboe<br>  Wojciech Kilar<br>  Witold Lutos?awski<br>  Per N?rg?rd<br>  Tarik O'Regan<br>  Einojuhani Rautavaara<br>  Valentin Silvestrov<br>  Robert Simpson<br>  Mark Anthony Turnage<br>  Erkki-Sven Tüür<br>  Pēteris Vasks<br>  Benjamin Wallfisch<br>  John Woolrich<br>  <br>  And I could go on (and on!).<br>  <br>  Why won't people listen?<br>  <br>  1) fear<br>  2) ignorance<br>  3) complacence ("I like what I know and I know what I like and I know all contemporary music is rubbish")<br>  4) lack of encouragement/exposure (Classic fM a prime culprit here - they think Ein-Audi is a cutting-edge modern composer!)<br>  5) laziness (see my question about lazy listeners yesterday)<br>  6) unwillingness to explore/learn/discover<br>  <br>  I shall continue to fly the flag for and advocate GOOD contemporary music until my dying breath.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Part of theproblem is the post-war reluctance to programme new  works. Another problem is that in the inter-bellus period we had truly great living composers such as Holst, Britain,Vaughan Williams, Shostakovich,Prokofiev, Stravinsky. Who of the current composers can live up to them ! Not many I should bet!|`|CrAwmz65aa	Someone asked a similar question two weeks ago:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AneJGPaRpvD_l.tVTF1jKGDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220205726AAQcJyQ&show=7#profile-info-yO3PIbY4aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I got two thumbs-down's for my answer, but I don't care.<br>  That's my opinion and I'm sticking with it.

That's really ME<br>  <br>  People born in the Year of the Snake are deep. They say little and possess great wisdom. They never have to worry about money; they are financially fortunate. Snake people are often quite vain, selfish, and a bit stingy. Yet they have tremendous sympathy for others and try to help those less fortunate. Snake people tend to overdo, since they have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on themselves. They are determined in whatever they do and hate to fail. Although calm on the surface, they are intense and passionate. Snake people are usually good-looking and sometimes have marital problems because they are fickle. They are most compatible with the Ox and Rooster.

Klb4ZYcVaa	I've been a Pixar fan for years, I actually have a resume with them. <br>  I have every movie they have ever made, all except the animated shorts. Although they were really entertaining, seems like a waste of space in my Pixar collection. What really DID caught my attention a couple weeks ago at the 2008 Academy Awards, "Presto" was a Pixar animated short that was nominated for Best Short Animation. Wall-E was also nominated for Best Animated feature. They lost the short, they  gained the Oscar for Wall-E. Not only that, they performed the Wall-E featured song for Best Original Score. So as a Pixar fan, don't waste your money on the shorts. Besides, every DVD they make has a featured animation. Don't spend your money twice.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	If you own all of the other disney/pixar movies then you already own all of the shorts, each full feature film has one of the shorts attached to it.<br>  <br>  I would say pass on the shorts if you already own most if not all of the full feature films.|`|413b409fd96101be076b46f8aee41bf0aa	I believe it is worth the money. You'll find shorts on it that aren't included on the other Pixar movies such as "Andre & Wally B.", "Tin Toy" and "Red's Dream". You'll also find a real informative documentary on the history of the Pixar shorts. I recommend it.|`|pNY6xXb5aa	Absolutely! the shorts are just as funny as the real deal.
tMerkVbVaa	Not scary, just gory. Weirdly enough i enjoy them, thats only because i have never before seen a film with so much gore so it was a strange and exciting feeling.<br>  <br>  However, it is good for a few laughs if you watch it with a big group of friends because people laugh at the stupidity of it. I actually find it quite funny when i look at the faces of the other people watching the movie and they look absolutely scared shitless.|`|oMGBeid5aa	i love the Saw movies, they are good if you like horror, you have to like gore and blood and stuff like that, but if not, Saw is not for you. i would sugest another movie which doesnt have blood or gore in it if you arent a big fan of horror|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	They are very gruesome, lots of torturous-like deaths. They are actually very interesting (to me) and all intertwined too. <br>  The first one was the only scary one simply because the plot was completely new, and totally messed up, and made you leave the theater going "WHAT. THE. F*CK."<br>  But the rest are just... gross. I hate how much I love them :)|`|JVUsliRGaa	Disgustingly gory, No decent plot, and terrible acting.<br>  a disgrace to the horror movie genre|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	The first one actually had a decent plot. After that they became a formulaic gore-fest.|`|sXVkRGJIaa	They are scary and funny at the same time.<br>  The lil guy with the mask on the tricycle never fails to make me laugh!

The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror, and after taking power, they took revenge as well by persecuting even those Jacobins who had helped to overthrow Robespierre, banning the Jacobin Club, and executing many of its former members in what was known as the White Terror.<br>  <br>  In the wake of excesses of the Terror, the Convention approved the new "Constitution of the Year III" on 22 August 1795. A French plebiscite ratified the document, with about 1,057,000 votes for the constitution and 49,000 against.[41] The results of the voting were announced on 23 September 1795, and the new constitution took effect on 27 September 1795.|`|L03tP6xiaa	Clean the window again... you can also look into ways to keep the bird away from there other than killing it.|`|kfM7ppWpaa	No doubt about it.....the bird must die!

I would be pissed also but life goes on.
SkRJNhuCaa	indeed, take lessons. <br>  And practice, practice, practice.... <br>  Just watching some youtube videos (most of which are rubbish anyway) isn't going to teach you anything.<br>  <br>  And do NOT try Stairway to Heaven. It's not going to do you any good. More people quit because of their failure to play that one properly than possibly any other single cause. And it's such a cliche many stores have signs up banning people from playing it because the staff is sick and tired of all the hundreds of daily attempts at playing it poorly by kids thinking they're guitargods.<br>  <br>  A good course to use is the one from Legacy: <a href="http://www.learnandmasterguitar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.learnandmasterguitar.com</a><br>  If you're serious about playing rather than aping chord progressions to some songs and little else it should serve you well.<br>  And don't worry that you can't change chords like mad. Accuracy is more important than speed, and no doubt you're more accurate than the vast majority of kids ripping out chords at break neck speech.|`|cEgBZV7Caa	take lessons. it sound stupid and everyone wants to be the guy who taught himself but that is 1 in a billion(Hendrix, Cobain)<br>  alway keep learning songs, do scales every day. good ur learning chords.

This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary coup, backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the Girondist faction, and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian sans-culottes. An alliance of Jacobin and sans-culottes elements thus became the effective centre of the new government.

LsElZqKUaa	Anti acid tablets are made from chalk so are toothpaste so don't worry.Eating of chalk can be dangerous. <br>  <br>  An abnormal craving to eat substances which are not normally consumed by humans is called Pica. Chalk is not harmful in the sense that it can poison you. Because of it's consistency, however residue is easily ingested into the lungs and could possibly cause pulmonary distress.<br>  <br>   A person who finds themselves wanting to ingest such things as chalk, talcum powder, etc. is suffering from a mineral deficiency. They should have a complete medical evaluation. <br>  <br>  Consider this;<br>  The the chemicals used in manufacturing of chalk is not edible.<br>  Any thing considered non-edible may be dangerous.<br>  <br>  Your stomach might hurt a little. There may be a little constipation too... so the best thing to do would be to look on the box. See if it says Nontoxic. If it is meant for kids, it probably is. If you're really worried, call poison control.

Especially when you have to place your index fingers on all the strings. =(|`|0F8hauikaa	I don't think so, but you can play a short version.

Stop using "I can't do it yet" as an excuse.  If you have that attitude, you'll suck forever.  Do you want to be a capable guitar player?  If so, you need to learn simpe major barre chords.  Here... do this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fmajorguitar.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fmajor...</a><br>  <br>  Now, take your fingers off.  Do it again.  Don't just strum it over and over.  Each time you hit the chord, remove your fingers and then find the chord again.  Do this, and ONLY this, for about an hour or two without stopping.  This is not the last time you're going to find some things that are difficult for you to do.  The way to play well is to overcome obstacles, not not looking for a substitute or alternative.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Um, F is a really rare chord when playing guitar anyway so don't even stress over it.|`|AGP2dI6uaa	Try an E#<br>  <br>  : P

The man finally decided to ask her to marry. She immediately said "yes". The next morning when he awoke, he couldn't remember what her answer was! "Was she happy? I think so, wait, no, she looked at me funny..." After about an hour of trying to remember to no avail he got on the telephone and gave her a call. Embarrassed, he admitted that he didn't remember her answer to the marriage proposal. "Oh", she said, "I'm so glad you called. I remembered saying 'yes' to someone, but I couldn't remember who it was."<br>  <br>  A man hasn't been feeling well, so he goes to his doctor for a complete check-up. Afterward, the doctor comes out with the results. "I'm afraid I have some very bad news," the doctor says. "You're dying, and you don't have much time left." "Oh, that's terrible!" says the man.

"SHUT UP!" the man says to his wife, "Shut the hell up, just sit back and be quite." Then the cop says, "well, since I've got you pulled over did you know that the tag on your license plate is expired?" "No Sir" the man replies, "I did not know that" "WHATEVER!" His wife yells, "I've been telling you to go get it up to date for 2 whole months now!" "Shut up" the man yells to his wife again! "Sit back and shut up, mind your own business!"

Here though, are ten movies, in chronological order, which are among the top mafia movies of all time.<br>  <br>  Scarface (1932)<br>  Kicking it old school. Howard Hawkes directs this classic cautionary Mafia tale, based in part on the real-life Al Capone. The film, which Roger Ebert says raised movie violence to a high in its day, is about Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), a bodyguard who rises to power when his gangland boss is offed. His mental state and violent life aren’t conducive to long term success. A film classic by a legendary director <br>  <br>  The Godfather (1972)<br>  All right, maybe this one is the best of the mafia films. You can find few movies that have the dark tone and gripping epic feel of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather. With Al Pacino as the son who almost broke free and Marlon Brando as the garbled ultimate Don, the Godfather is the gold standard of mob movies. Great casting, painstaking direction, scary and riveting story, relatable themes, and some of the most quoted lines in movie history. Based on the book by Mario Puzo. <br>  <br>  The Godfather II (1974)<br>  They say sequels never measure up, but somehow, this continuing story of the Corleone mafia family pulls it off. The Godfather Pt II won an Oscar like it’s predecessor and gave us a flashback look at the young Don Corleone’s rise to power. Hey, look, it’s Robert DeNiro speaking Italian. Interweaves the past and present of the family, creating another dark and twisted tale.|`|RmmO10xSaa	Russian mafia eastern promise|`|f6448d55e8a50b1308c23902bf4ef0e5aa	Mafia Wars|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	Eastern Promises is a great mob movie<br>  <br>  Gomorra is the latest|`|pNY6xXb5aa	Public Enemies with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, it's gonna be awesome!<br>  <br>  Trailer>>>> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/publicenemies/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/...</a>

Gu Zidi never hears the call, his men die and he gathers their bodies inside the mine. Gu Zidi awakes in a hospital and neither his identity and nor his officer ranking are recognized; the forty-seven soldiers that heroically died are only considered missing and their action is completely unknown by the high-command. Gu Zidi fights in the Korea War and spends the rest of his life feeling guilty for the death of his men and trying to prove and achieve recognition for the honorable deed of his forty-seven soldiers. <br>  <br>  Red Cliff (2008)<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/</a><br>  <br>  In the early third century, the land of Wu is invaded by the warlord Cao Cao and his million soldiers. The ruler of Wu, Sun Quan, calls on the rival warlord Liu Bei for help, but their two armies are still badly outnumbered. However, the Wu strategist Zhou Yu sees that Cao Cao's army is unused to battling on the sea, which may just give them a chance if they can exploit this weakness properly.<br>  <br>  These are the better foreign movies i would recommend as watching them in cinemas simply the best!|`|AA11656797	Yeah I've seen a few.... the last one I saw was "The Orphanage", it's a really good film.

In addition to its quotable musings on the rock 'n' roll lifestyle's allure, the profanity-peppered film also serves as a time capsule of bad 1980s fashion, complete with acid-washed jeans, Spandex, teased-out perms and badass muscle cars.<br>  <br>  Some others are:<br>  Story of the Year: Our Time is Now<br>  Punk's Not Dead<br>  Punk Attitude<br>  LiquidQUIETloud: A Film about the Pixies<br>  SCreamers - Made by the Lead singer from System of a Down<br>  The Cure: Rock Case Studies|`|E3i1OR74aa	well, there are emo bands on talent trove and they have accounts on there. you can talk to them and they'll answer all your questions. my band is on there and some were actually giving me vocal lessons<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.talentrove.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.talentrove.com</a>
3voM7Gfsaa	Apparently there is something being compiled surround the 90's boom of screamo, ala Orchid, Joshua Fit For Battle, Uranus, Honeywell etc, but I don't know how true it is, just some rumours that i've seen on messageboards.<br>  <br>  No idea about modern stuff like Raein, Daitro, etc and documentaries.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know if it's of interest but Norm whatever his name is who used to be in Texas is the Reason has recently released a book that is a compilation of the best bits of his zine (interviews and articles) from the 90's. It apparently covers a lot of the 90s post-hardcore stuff like Quicksand, Farside and a whole sh!t heap of other bands.
2JCIZAL0aa	Depends<br>  Mobile phones are better I suppose<br>  Television gotta be worse<br>  Music same<br>  Video games are good <br>  90's was the best in my opinion :) <br>  ?|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Yes, definitely. 80's music was awesome, and there are classic TV shows that they just don't make anymore; TV has lost its innocence. I can still watch "I Love Lucy" or "Three's Company" and LMAO. <br>  <br>  Today our "role models" are atheist doctors encouraging young women to have abortions; shows entirely about gays where we get to watch them go out to clubs and commit fornication; atheistic cartoons that mock Christianity; cartoons that introduce children to the Occult; witches and wizards; the Osbourne family (need I say more); "screamo" music; competitive shows that teach kids that singing or dancing is the most important thing in the world and that you're a failure if you don't make it; "sitcoms" where the Dad is weak and wimpy, and the mother is a commandeering b****;  putting celebrities on a pedestal whose lives are full of fornication, unwed pregnancies, drugs and alcohol. Yeah, those are great role models.|`|AA10269742	it depends...tv & music, yea.<br>  <br>  clothes & fads, no.  some stuff (like acid wash jeans & big hair) are just ugly and should stay in the 80s where it belongs.|`|0Sfyp6nAaa	I much prefer the 80's to now, especially when it comes to music.|`|oDz3Y7mfaa	yes, esp. in areas of commercial art, cartoons, and animated programming|`|gUuSmAZwaa	I like older stuff better|`|qfTXf57Uaa	most older music is way better, there were more drastic things goin on back then so they wrote about things with meaning ya know?<br>  Not just sex and crap hahaha.<br>  <br>  as for as technology, it's mutual.

AA11780840	One sign is not better then the other. Each sign has its strengths and weaknesses.<br>  So I do not agree that Scorpios are better then Pisces.<br>  I am a Pisces and my partner is Scorpio whom I love dearly in every way..<br>  I am quiet. I am a great listener. I am very empathetic. Very lovable. I care and take care of everyone especially my love ones. I am very compassionate. I am very creative and smart. Very intuitive. Very emotional. Sick a lot. Pessimistic. Indecisive.<br>  <br>  Scorpios are strong, passionate in every which way, career goal oriented. Very decisive. Can be possessive and very jealous. Compassionate to a point. Very generous and family oriented. A level head...Optimistic. Smart as well.|`|MtANnIlfaa	NO. Pisces are complex and empathetic.. Pisces negative traits don't compare to scorpio's negative traits.. Sometimes it seems as if there is nothing negative about Pisces (I mean serisously who doesn't like Pisces?!). They are not weak.. they are just too sweet for their own good.. and have better things to do then run off at the mouth. Why would it matter who is better though? They are both better off when they are together.|`|n53BNB8taa	Yes.Pisces can be lazy, boring and abuse their selves more than scorpios.|`|9DYiyQbGaa	please ignore this question.|`|ajzdsUldaa	There is no such thing as a "better" star sign.

Eli, we pisces might be simpleton to you but the fact is that we are pretty complex, more than you think you leo know.|`|NEw5dsJlaa	Pisces has a more adaptable nature and is one of the most intelligent signs (Einstein, Michelangelo, etc.) Pisces are much less intense and aggressive than Scorps and more humorous (although Pisces supposedly uses humor as a cover for emotional weakness.) Scorpios are paranoid while Pisces are overly trusting. Also, I've read there are two types of Pisces, upstream -dolphin types, and downstream -whale types, both act much differently.  Scorp and Pisces are similar, both artistic and emotional.

ak610Npjaa	the good thing is aquarius is drawn to the taurus woman for some reason and falls in love with us easily but i will say keeping this relationship happy and making it last will take everything u have. both must be patient and really want it to work this is one bumpy ride. the taurus cant deal with the aquarius wanting space and the aquarius cnt deal with the taurus wanting security and wanting to come b4 friends. hopefully your moon and or venus signs are compatible|`|tMerkVbVaa	They say that taurus and aquarius is a good match, however be warned because the aquarius might not be looking for a long-lasting relationship like the taurus.

That we now send our children into the world like we send young men to war... Hoping for their safe return... But knowing that some will be lost along the way. When did we lose our way?

We would organize and try to save quality TV shows.  Sometimes we succeeded, but this usually had to happen before the show was officially canceled, which is the case with Pushing Daisies.  We would also write to the sponsors of the shows.  Do not threaten boycotts; those don't work.  Instead, be positive.  Tell the sponsors that you have noticed and appreciate that they are sponsoring such a fine show, and that this definitely counts when you make purchasing decisions.  <br>  Good luck, but I think you may be too late to save this wonderful show.|`|ydKGJ7Nnaa	hopefully fifty million trillion gazzillion infinity|`|r1MImdh3aa	2 million-ish would be my guess|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Sorry, I'm as disappointed as you are, but it's hopeless.

AA11357436	there isn't an exact date out yet, but it should be mid march
Npltkuajaa	I've been watching anime since the year 2000, so I can name a few that might interest your taste.<br>  <br>  Looks like you've seen quite a number of animes around 2005+. And I must say you covered the better animes already, best to go back towards the roots of anime.<br>  <br>  Have you ever seen: Evangelion (a bit old in terms of animation quality, but it's still pretty popular and easy to find, and they also have a re-made version of it in movie form. They cut some scenes to make the movie go faster, but they also add a little bit more detail too.)<br>  <br>  Samurai X, a prequel to the "Kenshin" anime TV series. If you liked Samurai X, There's no doubt in my mind you'll like kenshin the series. That stuff is just raw goodness!!!<br>  <br>  Full Metal Panic series, great comedy, great action, great mecha, I'd say better mecha than Gundam SEED and its predecessors. Full Metal Panic has 3 series (the original, FMP Fumoffu, FMP the second raid) This series is GREAT! Like... really good. High rated back in the day, kinda disappeared off of sites because of the growing fan base of naruto.<br>  <br>  I'm sure u already watched Code Geass R2<br>  <br>  Ga Rei Zero is a good series (very dramatic; it's the prequel to the manga which you can read on onemanga.com)<br>  <br>  If you like mecha, try some of the newer gundams: Gundam SEED (and its sequel Gundam SEED Destiny), Gundam 00 and its second season Gundam 00 S2 (i like this one a lot). I feel like you dont have to like mecha to like Gundam 00. Its story is just so touching sometimes.<br>  <br>  but.. i will give u the ultimate anime suggestion. Listen well.<br>  <br>  "Hajime no Ippo" is a must see. I don't care if you are white, black, yellow, red, blue, green, male or female, 10 years old or 30. This is by far one of the greatest anime out there, I'm surprised not too many anime sites mention the first season at all.<br>  <br>  But before you do get into its 2nd season, "Hajime no Ippo - New Challeger" try to look up and download a batch of its first season. REALLY GOOD, and REALLY FUNNY.<br>  <br>  P.S. It's a boxing anime. Who woulda thunk it? ahaha. And from the looks of it, I'm sure this suggestion will help you a lot because u enjoyed history's strongest disciple, kenichi.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, If you have trouble finding these animes try looking at "baka-updates.com" first. If the links are broken then try to find a batch off of "tokyotosho.com". Those are my 2 go-to sites for anime.<br>  <br>  P.S.S. Lol I keep remembering all these good series! now im addicted in digging in my past.|`|X3dfHBGGaa	spirited away<br>  <br>  shin chan(comedy)<br>  <br>  princess mononoke<br>  <br>  my neighbor totoro<br>  <br>  case closed/detective conan|`|Hiasgb75aa	Elfen Lied|`|fbOS6GVpaa	Fruits Basket<br>  Lucky Star<br>  Moon Phase<br>  Blood Plus<br>  Helllsing<br>  Hellsing Ultimate!<br>  <br>  I'd really have to say if you like the animes that you've watched, then you should definitely check out Hellsing Ultimate. It's amazing. It's a bit different than Hellsing (bc it goes a long with the manga storyline.) But it's very, very cool! The characters are great too. If you haven't checked it out yet you should.|`|Nw0FOBFEaa	D-Grey Man:<br>  Set during the end of a fictional nineteenth century on Earth, D.Gray-man mostly centers around 15-year-old Allen Walker, who is gifted with the ability to control a weaponized form of a divine substance from ages past, called Innocence, and becomes an Exorcist of the Black Order. This secretive organization aims to stop the plan set in motion by the Millennium Earl to destroy all life on Earth, thus ‘cleansing’ it. But the Earl has raised an army of Akuma, created by taking advantage of grief over a loved one’s death, and summoned the direct descendants of Noah himself, the 13-strong Noah Clan, to aid him in his second attempt. Because of the Akuma’s ability to wear a human’s skin, they are nearly undetectable by any human. Allen proves to be a powerful asset as his ‘cursed’ left eye is able to detect the Akuma..<br>  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya:<br>  On the first day of high school a beautiful girl named Haruhi Suzumiya introduces herself as having “no interest in ordinary humans”. She asks for any aliens, time travelers, sliders or espers to join her. Watching her weird behaviour is Kyon who sits in front of Haruhi and is the only person who talks to her. When Kyon comments about Haruhi’s joining every club in school and then quitting he unwittingly gives Haruhi an idea to start her own after school club. Thereafter Kyon and several others find themselves dragged, literally, into the Save our world by Overloading it with fun Suzumiya Haruhi’s Brigade (the S.O.S. Brigade for short).<br>  Hope I Helped!|`|6dAsdiA5aa	Try these animes:::<br>  <br>  <> Katekyou Hitman Reborn!<br>  <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/1604/Katekyo_Hitman_Reborn!" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/anime/1604/Kateky...</a><br>  <br>  <> Macross Frontier<br>  <a href="http://www.macrossf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.macrossf.com/</a><br>  <br>  <> Natsume Yuujin-Chou<br>  <a href="http://www.natsume-anime.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.natsume-anime.jp/</a><br>  <br>  <> Spice & Wolf<br>  <a href="http://www.spicy-wolf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spicy-wolf.com/</a><br>  <br>  <> Gundam 00<br>  <a href="http://www.gundam00.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gundam00.net/</a><br>  <br>  <> D.Gray Man<br>  <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/1482/D.Gray-man" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/anime/1482/D.Gray...</a><br>  <br>  <> Kuroshitsuji<br>  <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kurosh...</a><br>  <br>  <> Gintama<br>  <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama</a>|`|KzUBsF3Maa	trinity blood<br>  blood+<br>  saiyuki<br>  cowboy bebop<br>  yu yu hakusho<br>  flame of recca<br>  fushigi yugi<br>  rurouni kenshin<br>  kyo<br>  princess mononoke<br>  spirited away<br>  detective conan<br>  howl's moving castle|`|u5eHNj0taa	black blood brothers<br>  Kurokami <br>  Shonen Onmyouji<br>  Zoids Genesis

d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	Taurus With Leo:<br>  These two make a fairly good combination, especially when each understands the other's faults. Excellent physical qualities and great physical appeal are usually there for both partners. Loyal Leo is just what the doctor ordered for the Taurus's love of the nicer things in life. As long as the Taurus restrains jealousy and lets the Leo show off a bit, all will go well with this astrological compatibility match. <br>  <br>  taurus and leo - astrological compatibility rank = 6 (10 is best) <br>   <br>  The most negative thing about this relationship is probably the lack of spiritual conectiveness. This zodiac sign match up can be very hard to go the distance in the long term. They tend to make good boyfriend/girlfriend relationships, but that unfortunately is about the extent of it.|`|tFcsLR7Maa	I've always liked taurus' in a way but i don't think astrologically speaking their compatible.

She's like this muse that falls in love with a mortal. I love this movie. But if it's not the one you're looking for I'd still watch it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! :]]|`|Ausr4gsJaa	Was it made in the 90's? There is a movie with Ava Gardner that sounds kind of like what you are talking about- A Touch of Venus, but it's from the 40's.<br>  Could it be one of these?-<br>  <br>  The Muse - This 1999 movie depicted Sharon Stone as an inspiration for a filmmaker who had lost his creative steam. Now you know that this title came from the characters in Greek mythology that inspired artists.<br>  <br>  Sirens - This Hugh Grant and Elle MacPherson film takes place in the late 1920s, and tells the story of an artist on an island whose work and lifestyle are observed by a visiting bishop. The artist's lifestyle included having many female "friends" around who inspire his work. You now understand that the title of this movie is not incidental; the sirens were gorgeous creatures that lured men to their deaths with their beautiful siren songs.<br>  <br>  A Midsummer Night's Dream - This movie, starring Calista Flockhart (whose name in Greek means "good"), Kevin Kline, and Michelle Pfeiffer, is based on Willy Shakespeare's play. In it, nymphs and other magical spirits contribute to the air of confusion, silliness, and falling in love with the wrong partner. You are now a bit wiser, for you realize that nymphs were the spritely gods of the forest who liked to play tricks on humans.<br>  <br>  Clash of the Titans - This movie, starring Harry Hamlin, basically retells the story of Perseus and how he encountered mythological creatures to save his girlfriend. A super-cheesy movie, but you'll get to see a bunch of actors portraying the gods.

3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	It's not a movie.  Like a couple of other posters have said, it's an episode of a documentary-style TV show called "I Shouldn't Be Alive."  The episode's title was "Shark Survivor."<br>  <br>  The episode was the very first of the series and it aired in 2005 on Discovery.  The actual incident happened in 1982.  One of the surviviors wrote a book about it, titled "Albatross," which came out in 1994.  It later appeared in Reader's Digest as a featured condensed book.|`|xqrwDmyUaa	It's not Open Water, 1 or 2, in the first one they have no dingy it's just one couple floating in the water in lifejackets/scuba gear and they are never found. In the second one it's a group of people they have a large boat and I they jump into the water and are unable to climb back up onto the boat after doing so. There are no sharks in Open Water 2. So it can't be either film. Sorry I can't help more, just wanted to say it wasn't Open Water.|`|pNY6xXb5aa	Open Water maybe? Goddamn that movie sucked donkeyballs|`|UxG6CkU2aa	It was on the discovery channel.

There is immediately conflict and tension amongst the strangers. Then, a storm engulfs them, and rips the boat apart. The life raft blows away, and the five crew members are forced to take refuge in a 12-foot inflatable dinghy. With no food and no water they soon deteriorate. Can they keep the tiny boat afloat as sharks try to flip them into the sea? Can they resist the all-consuming urge to drink seawater?|`|Ji3P0BeIaa	i think it was " Lost" or "Deep blue sea"
IxLj8bBZaa	Hello!<br>  I don't know if this is it, because the plot is a bit different from what you describe.

Woke up the next day, worried all day before texting my friend to say sorry.  She was fine, but an ex workmate of mine wasn't, cause I'd been slagging her off very loudly and she was in the next table to me.<br>  <br>  In my defence the ex workmate had been a ***** to me for years.

When you add the 7th (remember we're in A minor) - F. This gives a (full) diminished 7th<br>  <br>  Take a triad built from the root of a minor key - say C minor.<br>  This gives C. Eb and G.

He died at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami, Florida on the morning of May 11, 1981, at the age of 36. The spread of melanoma to his lungs and brain caused his death. His final words to his son Ziggy were "Money can't buy life."[20] Marley received a state funeral in Jamaica on May 21, 1981, which combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Rastafari tradition. He was buried in a chapel near his birthplace with his Gibson Les Paul and a Bible. A month before his death, he had also been awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit.<br>  <br>  Marley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Time magazine chose Bob Marley & The Wailers' Exodus as the greatest album of the 20th century.<br>  <br>  In 2001, Marley was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and a feature-length documentary about his life, Rebel Music, won various awards at the Grammys. With contributions from Rita, the Wailers, and Marley's lovers and children, it also tells much of the story in his own words.|`|AA11817490	I heard he was playing football damaged his toe and it went all septic & infected and eventually he died of it (that doesnt sound vwery believable now i read it myself though)|`|AA11589095	His parachute got tangled.|`|QmOmbprOaa	HE DIED OF LUNG AND BRAIN CANCER IS WHAT HIS SON ZIGGY TOLD ME.|`|c0p2BYwnaa	The truth is he got cancer in his toe.

oQSzZeubaa	Hello!  There have been several books written on this very subject (see <a href="http://www.vintagemusicbooks.com/si/BOOKS021158I.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vintagemusicbooks.com/si/BOOK...</a> , for example), which is where you should go for a complete and accurate answer.  Another very good source is Wikipedia (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratocaster" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratocaste...</a> ), which has quite a lot of detail regarding the guitar.  In a nutshell, the early Stratocasters (1954 to 1965) are considered the true vintage guitars, and are the most sought-after.  The CBS-era guitars (late-1965 to 1985) are generally thought of as less-desirable, due mainly to the varying standards of quality and country-of-origin.  After selling the company to a group of private investors in 1985, quality and consistency began improving, as did the number of models being offered.  Over the years, the Stratocasters changed neck shapes (V-shape/C-shape, etc.), fretboards (maple/rosewood/ebony, scalloped surface, cross-section radii, vintage/medium-jumbo/jumbo frets, etc.), headstocks (small/large), body materials (alder/basswood/ash, etc.), hardware (vintage/two-point tremolo/Floyd-Rose style bridges), pickups (traditional/single coil/lace-sensors/noiseless/humbuckers, etc.), and electronics (3-way/5-way pickup selector switches/TBX control/pickup coil-tap switches/active circuitry, etc.).  Essentially, today’s standard Stratocaster is just that: a solid instrument that has matured over time into what the modern player wants to see in a quality guitar (modern C-neck, medium-jumbo frets, two-point tremolo bridge, precision machine tuners, etc.).  The deluxe models typically add improved pickups and hardware, and sometimes dress-up items (special colors/pickguard/knobs/locking machine tuners/upgraded bridge, etc.).  Vintage models seek to replicate the look, feel, and tone of the original Fender product.  Lastly, the HSS Stratocasters have a definite respected place in the hierarchy of Fender guitars, and are looked upon as simply another specialized tool in the guitar player’s tone arsenal!  Looking at the Fender site today, there are no less than 60 models to choose from (see <a href="http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?section=guitars&cat=stratocaster&pg=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.fender.com/products//search.p...</a> ), and with the Custom Shop you can have a Stratocaster equipped virtually any way you want!  As you can see, a discussion of the specific years and variations is well beyond the scope of Yahoo! Answers.  Sorry if this answer was too long-winded, but I do hope some of it helps get you started in the right direction.  Best regards, Dana|`|3gRbkfxEaa	What it all means is feel and tone. Through the years Fender has changed the neck radius,the head stock, pickups, If you want a humbucker in the bridge position its not a sin. But most blues players<br>  I believe prefer single coils in all positions. You can purchase pickups that are humbuckers that look like single coils also. Standards are what they say they are standard production model, deluxe may include a different set of pickups from the standard or neck radius etc.. Vintage reissues are generally custom shop reissues of strats from years gone by where significant changes to the guitar made them different from the others. 54,57,62 etc... they are replicas of the old ones. True Vintage are the actual guitar from the year they were built and are VERY expensive nowadays, 50's - 60's strats command a large price tag.

fk9AvB25aa	Nick and Katie postponed the wedding. Jackie tried to stop it but eventually Bridgettes feelings came up then all of the sudden disappeared. I'm not too sure what the writers are doing with that story line, they have been focusing more on Rick and Steffie.<br>   Rick tried to enlist in the Army but they wouldn't take him because he was recently paralyzed a few months ago. Ridge and Rick had another roof top fight and this time Ridge went over the edge but Rick pulled Ridge back up saving Ridges life. But after all of that Ridge still wouldn't give in to let Rick and Steffie be together. Ridge is till convinced that only harm will come to Steffie if she and Rick will still try to see each other.<br>  Guess what RIck and Steffie made love a few days ago. Some one tried to torch Rick's beach house. Every one thinks that Rick is still being manipulative with Steffie and Brook. The obvious suspects at the moment are Stephanie, Ridge, Thorne, Marcus, Owen and Pam who all want Rick out of Forrester Creations. Lieutenant Baker and son are back to investigate and they think that some one deliberately tried to burn the beach house down to kill Rick. Steffie was not in the house at the time but it happened on the same day that they made love. A few days after the fire Rick decided to fire Owen and Pam but Stephanie doesn't like the decision and decided to over ride Rick's firing and wants her sister to stay at Forrester.|`|3CP1IV2Waa	No they didn't get married. The wedding has been postponed. It seems as if Jackie's dislike of Katie came from no where.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	No they didn't. She told him that she couldn't follow through with the wedding "that" day, but maybe some day they will.

This made Louis appear to be conspiring with the enemies of France. 17 January 1793 saw Louis condemned to death for "conspiracy against the public liberty and the general safety" by a close majority in Convention: 361 voted to execute the king, 288 voted against, and another 72 voted to execute him subject to a variety of delaying conditions. After he was executed, citizens that witnessed the beheading ran forth to have their clothes soaked in the late King's blood, dripping from his head.[25] The 21 January execution led to more wars with other European countries. Louis' Austrian-born queen, Marie Antoinette, would follow him to the guillotine on 16 October.|`|1eAASZQyaa	Nope.Library.Lunch.But I ain't suppose to be on this.

AA10859773	Nope.  Gay or straight he's still HOTTTT.|`|AA12390047	I don't need to see his private pictures and no it won't influence me.  But I don't think he'll win after hearing Lil Rounds this week.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	No, the fact that he's gay will not influence my voting decisions.  Well, actually I don't even get to vote because I live in Canada. But anyway, I think he'll make it to like the top 3 or so but that's it.  He's really talented that's for sure, but I think there are a couple of others who are slightly more talented than him.  People shouldn't vote or not vote for him just because he's not straight.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	I'm just going to vote based on his performances each week.  He hasn't been my fave, and I knew he was gay, the photos I've seen before just confirmed it.  It's not that being gay bothers me or many others, I think it's those shots that are pretty provocative, you know?  And they weren't private photos, they were public shots.  Makes me wonder what kind of character he is, is all.  I mean, if these were straight shots of someone making out all in leather and lace in public, I'd still be a bit like hmm, what's up with that.  Why are they being so loose like that.<br>  Not such a good image for kid fans, either.<br>  So I'll just wait and see how he performs against the others as far as voting goes.  This season has been so downhill, it's frustrating.  Last season was so exciting, this year's a major letdown.|`|AA11620976	Not at all> I don't like the guy based on him absolutely trashing and making a baroque mockery out of the greatest rock 'n roll song ever written.<br>  For the judges to have gone goo-goo gah gah over that horrible version of Satisfaction really raises questions about their  bona -fides as rock people>of course they could have just been reading their  remarks from a script|`|HWiuRgNxaa	i dont like him anyway but i cant see why his kissing a boy effects his voice in any way|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	No it will not influence my vote. I wasn't going to vote for him before those pics came out, and i still will not be voting for him. Besides, everyone should've already known he was gay, no surprise there! Even though he may be slightly talented, i'm just tired of seeing his over-the-top performances and his "look at me, i'm so sexy" looks into the camera. He and Tatiana both are very annoying and they need to go bye-bye, in my opinion.|`|bh8AjH3Taa	No it won't influence me. I didn't like him in the beginning. I don't like him now.

KSC02NcLaa	Its not Hate, its Fact.  4Kids Sucks.  They've consistently changed Things that have nothing to do with "because of the children".  In One Piece : The Marines into the Navy.  I can understand the Lollipop but the old timey rifles into the water guns?  They are ignorant JackA$$es that are screwing with an awesome series, If 4kids had made it to Brooke's Arrival, All the kids would have to ask who's Laboon? or they would have rewrote the series to cut that backstory out.  If you want an entirely different Cartoon, write it, its not like 1/2 of it wasn't rewritten anyways.  Ace into Trace,(his name is on his ARM).  Who knows what they would have done to the Skypeia Arc, probably skipped it entirely, due to its religious aspect.  4Kids are the Scum of the Earth.|`|C2IXyUKNaa	there are some good shows on 4kids but they totally chop up the shows and change the story line around . like mew mew power, they use the episode that was episode 13 in japan into episode one in america and that episode had nothing to do with the rest of the series, watch both the subbed and the dubbed and you will see what i mean, and also like yu-gi-oh, they cut out alot of scenes, which i would loved to seen, but no they had to cut them. so i really cant blame the harsh criticism that is going around 4kids, they might be thinking about us but maybe if they could just lighten up a bit with the censoruing and choping up the show, maybe they will get less criticism, and would be nice if they could ask our opion about how to do there shows.

The movie is the sixth in the Harry Potter series and is due out this summer.<br>  Knox played the part of Marcus Belby, a minor character.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Haha, you were totally drunk, I recently saw Inside Actors Studio about him.

c3Kay8Z3aa	Lil Rounds by far! Fantasia was a joke, a fluke.|`|aihogb26aa	We've only seen a couple full performances from Lil Rounds so far, so I think it's too soon to tell what her style is, or what she can even do vocally. We've mostly just seen her sing straight R&B and we haven't really seen her do anything totally original yet. I like her a lot, but I don't think we've really seen what she can do yet, so it's too soon to really compare them yet.|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	Lil' has better technical vocals because Fantasia tended to get a bit screechy sometimes. But Fantasia has soul and that's what really won over America. The raw emotion of her "Summertime" performance and her winning song "I Believe" really made the audience feel her because there was so much heart and passion in those performances. That's not to say that lil' doesn't have soul,though,it's just more of a subdued soul, but though I love her voice,I don't feel that emotional connection yet. But the show did just start, so I can't really judge yet. If she picks the right song that really shows off her voice and her heart and that she really connects with and feels emotionally, she could have her "moment" just like Fantasia did with "Summertime" and "I Believe"|`|tdulyzXXaa	LiL Rounds actually reminds me more of Latoya London from Season 3 than of Fantasia. I remember Simon and the gang raving over her the same way they are doing for Lil today.|`|5Pgs61ePaa	Fantasia|`|EpGJbHhEaa	I don't think Fantasia can sing that good. I like lil rounds.|`|JeGFjGWqaa	Lil' Rounds is way better than Fantasia.<br>  <br>  Fantasia never should have won. She won because of her "sob story". Who cares?!<br>  She hasn't even had that much success. The runner-up Diana Degarmo has had way more success and is a way better singer!|`|EJhhz9oLaa	as of today Fantasia we havent seen enough of Lil & if she sang like she did when she got in the top 12 she'd be a wild card at best|`|tEQbbthKaa	Lil Rounds is really good but Fantasia is better|`|aKQk6aa1aa	I prefer Big Rounds.

Some people are clueless, that's a very limited person who said that.<br>  <br>  When someone says something like that I say "I'm not sure, but last time I checked, music was for everyone."<br>  <br>  Taylor Dane and Michael Bolton? OMG LOL  He didn't know you, did he? =)|`|adLSRFrZaa	I look surprisingly normal for a person who likes Psychedelic Rock, Krautrock, and Electronica.

Just kiddin XD.<br>  <br>  However he/she wants to but I guess they want to see a hippie or a metalhead looking person but those are just stereotypes you'll be surprised to see how many of us don't fall into the stereotypes though.|`|7fEVNng5aa	If we looked like what we listen to, the majority of us (here, at least) would look quite strange. Is it even possible for me to look like someone who loves Metal, Psychedelic, Electronica, Pop, Jazz, Folk, etc ad nauseam, all at the same time?<br>  <br>  To answer your question- there is no look for classic rock, that I know of. It's not a "scene"|`|aKBqMLuhaa	lol You'd just need to look like you like rock and roll. Maybe you dress ultra conservative that indicates you listen to stuff like Amy Grant.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	<< Like meeee!! XD|`|OTFzJbaMaa	hahah some people right... i think this is one thing that happends to aloot of female ( and male but probably not as much) rock fans. for instance my favorite band is alice in chains and people are usually shocked to find this out. why?? probably because i dont wear tight black pants and a striped shirt that sais " id rather not be here" or anything like that. <br>  ill be the first to admit i can see where these people come from FOR ME because i look one way but as a person i am not how i dress. i wear abercrombie and skirts and spongebob. <br>  but too many people judge you on how you look rather then who you are.
WPVpOfuwaa	It was something about Sting and the Apocalypse, there were mermaids and aliens there too. In the end the mermaid who controlled the world fell in love with me.<br>  <br>   It was kind of sad.....|`|DNCmoJsiaa	I have way weir dreams... Some of which I post here on YA for explanations.  But nobody answers.<br>  <br>  Dream 1.  I was on a buisness trip and a girl I work with was there (in real life I barely know her or talk to her) we had to share a room.  She had blonde hair and wore conservative clothes.  Then in the room I was laying face down on the bed, nude.  She got on top of me to give me a massage, but only now wore black lingrie and had long black hair.  She asked me if I was ready, I told  her that I didn't know her, so I would have to use a condom.  She gave me one, but it was huge and pink, the opening was the size of a sandwich bag.  I tried to put it on, but it kept coming off.  At the same time she changed back to the blonde with conservitative outfit.<br>  <br>  Dream 2.  I was in prison walking around the grounds with 2 buddies and a girl.  We came to the corner concrete wall and jumped up to look over.  On the other side we saw some grass and a huge electric fence.  We knew we couldn't go any further that way.  Suddenly I looked at the girl and started kissing her.  Her lips were really soft and mine were chapped.  I told her that I liked her soft lips.  The other 2 guys said they'd better leave the 2 lovers alone and left.  Me and the girl walked back to the prison dorm.  I remember she had bleech white hair except with one streak of black almost in the center.  We lay on the bed together and just kissed.  Then morning came, she got up and let me touch her a little, then she left.|`|DbIL3BItaa	That I was in a bathroom that was for some reason lit up dark red, and a bald guy flashed up next to me. And I went on a vendetta against the owner of the house for having a bald ghost, but then we became friends :S|`|be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	I was hitch hiking, i got picked up by this guy and 2 girls.

And this lady threw bullets and a gun at me, thinking I wouldnt use it, then I picked it up off the ground and went to shoot at her because she propped her gun up at me, just to find out before I shot that my friend was the evil one. Then the rest of the dream was a series of me running around familiar childhood places just to have the bad guy find me there.<br>  <br>  I like your dream though, nice message indeed.|`|rEXZHnRyaa	I dreamt that I was living in a 2 story house that was starting to flood with ice cold water. It was hailing violently outside with lots of lightning and thunder!<br>  My girlfriend and I had to run upstairs to the second floor but we felt that the house was starting to shake from so much water running through it.<br>  It was so scary I felt like I was having a heart attack in my dream and in real life!|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	a giant Oreo cookie was tearing down a tower with me in it and i thought the only way to make it stop was to take a bite out of it everytime it hit my tower.......|`|rqASGeevaa	One of my wierdest dreams was I was being chased by a giant bumble bee in a huge furry maze stripped in black and yellow.

If there are odds in Vegas on him and Molly getting married, I'd bet they won't last. He'll dump her.<br>  <br>  I'm actually done with the show. The only reason I tuned in was that I really originally liked Jason. I thought he was a good guy. After this stuff, he's not better than the rest. So, I'm done. <br>  <br>  How cold do you have to be to dump someone on national television.|`|uVwPykXlaa	am sure mel was just genuinely looking for love but was so betrayed by all this.<br>  i personaly think molly is not pretty but hey beauty is in the eye of the BEERHOLDER|`|AA11303007	No, she was lucky she found out he was a cry baby before she wasted anymore time on him.|`|OBwqjS8maa	Well, really, if he's such an enormous ***, maybe he did her a favor.|`|d716c2079956916d7ee407432e851f1caa	Watching the bachelor for the whole season and then having to see such an awful ending leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I know tv shows are just for entertainment but they know we get sucked into these shows and get to know the people on them. I was so disappointed in Jason and the way he handled things. I can't believe he is so self-centered that he couldn't have taken time to make the right decision in the first place. Melissa is too good for him and I hope she finds that special someone who will treat her right and make her happy. Molly and Jason.....I hope you get what you deserve :(|`|Urqs3bo5aa	oh my god he totally should have thought about it before picking her <br>  <br>  im just amazed she didn't like get sooo pissed off and like hurt him or something <br>  <br>  and i totally think deanna shouldn't have been allowed to have come|`|0BC2WTyoaa	Personally I think Melissa dodged a bullet and Molly is pretty blind if she thinks he will be true and fight for her when things get tough.  In the end Molly will end up hurting much more than Melissa is right now.  I think Melissa would be much more hurt had he done things properly and kept it all private, she would still think he was a good guy and he really isn't.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	I think he should have picked Molly from the get-go.<br>  .<br>  Melissa was quoted today saying: "I knew on the night After the Final Rose [aired], I wasn't getting dumped. We had already ended the relationship and that was mutual."
VR5dGg4taa	Chuck Norris' tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried.<br>  <br>   Chuck Norris counted to infinity - twice.<br>   <br>  Chuck Norris does not hunt because the word hunting infers the probability of failure. Chuck Norris goes killing.<br>   <br>  If you can see Chuck Norris, he can see you. If you can't see Chuck Norris you may be only seconds away from death.<br>  <br>  Chuck Norris sold his soul to the devil for his rugged good looks and unparalleled martial arts ability. Shortly after the transaction was finalized, Chuck roundhouse kicked the devil in the face and took his soul back. The devil, who appreciates irony, couldn't stay mad and admitted he should have seen it coming. They now play poker every second Wednesday of the month.<br>  <br>   When the Boogeyman goes to sleep every night he checks his closet for Chuck Norris.<br>  <br>   Chuck Norris built a time machine and went back in time to stop the JFK assassination. As Oswald shot, Chuck Norris met all three bullets with his beard, deflecting them. JFK's head exploded out of sheer amazement.<br>  <br>   Chuck Norris has already been to Mars; that's why there are no signs of life there.<br>  <br>   They once made a Chuck Norris toilet paper, but it wouldn't take **** from anybody.<br>  <br>   A blind man once stepped on Chuck Norris' shoe. Chuck replied, "Don't you know who I am? I'm Chuck Norris!" The mere mention of his name cured this man blindness. Sadly the first, last, and only thing this man ever saw, was a fatal roundhouse delivered by Chuck Norris.|`|b0820b779bddcaf952455997bfbc0c52aa	haha...thats funny, but i don't know if that was really a question though.|`|NA3HDsNnaa	that mean he should cry to cure cancer people lol him scary|`|pVnUhYLQaa	When Chuck Norris does push ups he's not pushing himself up, he's pushing the earth down.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	The  leading causes of death in America:<br>  1. heart disease<br>  2.

2UDbOpxTaa	Wow I'm genuinely impressed. What materials are you using? (it looks like either watercolours or acrylics on paper from the photos?) In GCSE art a lot of the grade counts on your prep sheets, but if they're up to scratch I'd say these are anywhere between A* and B. I did GCSE art and the prep sheets are just as important, if not more important, than the final pieces.

p5ZJfiIaaa	I definitely think you need to do the drama classes, and be in a production in front of your "friends". Acting is about getting over that fear and embarrassment, especially if it's something you're truly passionate about. If you're really serious about acting, then the teasing or jokes or whatever should not bother you. Also, when you join a drama class or a school play you make GREAT friends that like what you like and will be supportive of you!<br>  And besides that, you ARE only 15, and believe me when I say that in a few years, nothing that happened in high school will even matter- in regards to teasing and all that. <br>  <br>  Just get your butt onto that stage! :-)|`|5oEJuhwiaa	You need to stop thinking about what your friends think and start thinking about what you want. Do you truly want to act? If your answer is yes then that is all that matters! If your friends can't accept that and can't support you then they don't sound like very good friends. And you also need to keep in mind that nobody starts at the top. A lot...and i do mean a lot of famous actors/actresses started out by joining drama class in their schools. That's actually how many people realize they want to be an actor.|`|36a4c3871d0748f9bc6bd28fba96940faa	Personally I was the outsider at High School but as soon as I joined the drama class I found other "outsiders" even though they were popular and made some really great friends.  It shouldn't matter what your peers say just what you say.  I know that the "laws of high school" makes you feel like you can't do what you feel like you want to, but screw them.  <br>  <br>  If you're really interested in acting the best place to start is drama class in high school.  Sign up at maybe you're local theater company as well.  The more you have on your acting resume the more the colleges and universities you apply to for acting will take notice.  Again think about you, not other ppl, and I hope you have the best of luck.

At times it can be aggravating.<br>  I like them because I love to shoot pool.|`|AA12023256	I was going to say Marco Polo.<br>  Wrong type of pool I guess. *Shrugs*<br>  <br>  I like 8-ball. Just a little longer of a game is all. They are both enjoyable.|`|VR5dGg4taa	i prefer marco polo or chicken fighting..in a swimming pool|`|UpfLvUXeaa	8 ball, because i don't know how to play 9 ball|`|3I0FUZjUaa	8 ball....because I can look into it and it will tell me whether on not I will win :D|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Just regular eight ball on a bar sized table.

I can't get away with things like that.|`|wgYMHW9Naa	I did before...kind of!  When I was 15, I was at a concert and thought the lead singer of this local band was EXTREMELY HOT.  I could see him checkin me out and he came up to talk to me.  I tried to avoid the conversation of 'how old are you?' for as long as I could but it was inevitable.. He thought I was 21 or 22, and it turns out he was 10 years older than me, LOL!<br>  Needless to say the conversation ended right there, pretty much.  Talk about jailbait|`|Ng7sF33Oaa	lMFAO.

I've had a fake I.D. before, so yeah. Great story, it's hilarious-wait! What are you doing buying a lighter? Hmmm...|`|qrGLcTh4aa	I don't take advantage of anybody.

I look tons better than both of those pics.|`|04TD5L6Yaa	Beyonce!!|`|7sMaduVeaa	Beyonce|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	beyonce<br>  she is a little buff though|`|AA10958272	Beyonce.<br>  <br>  But, ask this again to be fair --after Beyonce has a kid (J-Lo had 2). Jennifer Lopez is also about 15 years older than Beyonce, and there's a whole lot of living/partying in those years in between.<br>  <br>  Beyonce is taller with a bigger bustline, and longer legs. She's naturally prettier. But, J-Lo uses her own hair -- something I wish Beyonce would do, in go natural and not pretend she's a blonde girl (!). Beyonce is larger than life. She's got a better voice. Her eyes shine. For what J-Lo's "got" -- she's done a lot with far less. Because of the booty-licious beginnings for both -- and J-Lo's major claim to fame really was that "Selena" movie, her scenes filmed from the back, and of course, a very married at the time.. P-Diddy's interest...<br>  <br>  Beyonce.|`|HsrRNnIBaa	J-Lo. She has a more feminine body. Beyonce has a man's stomach.|`|562qoBUUaa	They both have beautiful bodies, but Beyonce's is better in those pics.|`|l0KzFSUbaa	the first one, the one that said pop star|`|Rez6KpoNaa	b|`|3wjS3Hlaaa	I'd say beyoncé, but that's because I lover her tan.

m3ThrbDMaa	If you put enough Ketchup on it, I'm sure it will be fine...|`|rZFHZjDvaa	Even misspelled, that sounds slightly better than the local glass repair shop and their promise of a cheap "hot resin crack injection".  I'd go for it.|`|DjifToZgaa	Is it an emulsion or fiber matrix? UV stabilized?<br>  <br>  Damn it Bob.<br>  <br>  It's like you ring the bell and ask "Trick or Treat?" and then run away leaving a grubby, homemade felt pumpkin bag full of Mounds and empty Snickers wrappers.  What now?<br>  <br>  If it's a mulch or soil stabilization product, go with the misspelling.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oooh!  ABS.  So probably thermoformed, say vacuum formed in a color other than black.  Even it was rotational molding I have changed my mind.  Go with the correct spelling.|`|V1jg3Onfaa	Depends. If it's advertised by a sexy young blond, then yeah. Chicks can pretty much sell me anything. That's why they use them so much in advertising. That's why those Mormans that come around from time to time are usually young sexy women in heels and skirts. So you'll talk to them. It's the only chance an old ***** like me ever gets the chance.|`|gjENahMSaa	It bothers me too, but now you've made me hungry for a McDonald's shake...isn't that also a stabilized polymer product from a large commercial distributor?|`|wqL84O8Naa	sure why not? i like ballz|`|bn9UcokFaa	I like truth in advertising<br>  <br>  I don't believe Enzyte really works|`|xJqb88oAaa	Is this question about dildos?|`|AfEHzl1eaa	What kind of phallic shaped toys are you slanging now?

ZbpaRKkUaa	Okay, it's like this. The British imposed the Salt Tax. To protest against that Gandhiji made the famous Dandi March from Sabarmati to the village of Dandi at the coast. There he went and made salt. He encouraged people to make their own salt to revolt against the Salt Act. So the people are being prevented from into the factory to make salt. Now Gandhiji's way or revolt was nonviolent. So the passive resistance the people put up against the lathi charge(caning) from the police is their way of going against the British. Just to see who would give in first.|`|x1gtaqwVaa	because they no that gandhi is for non violence and they respect and believe in him and that that is the right thing.  gandhi got many people on his side because of his non-violent ways.|`|bb42d443e7bc5cd7a74461b93a1db644aa	The only way to show that they were willing to fight for their rights was when they took anything the government threw at them so they took the beatings to show their dedication to the cause|`|0565260f0cb80c4e8acca65bc2938706aa	to see in the raw whats happening.
dHcP602caa	I was totally pissed off when I saw that the judges picked her. There were plenty of other people besides her who could have had a second chance.<br>  She was horrible tonight. Sang the same song she did before.<br>  She didn't make it, and I'm happy about that. I would have boycotted the show.|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	No, i definitely do not think she should've been a wild card pick. I thought we'd seen the last of her and was actually mad when they chose her lol. She's too annoying and it overrides whatever talent she may have. I have a few that i think should've made it in before her, but i would've rather seen ANYONE get it before her...|`|tEQbbthKaa	I wish she would have gone home and not come back.

I don't think she'll last long.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I wouldn't mind seeing her have a breakdown again when she is REJECTED.|`|jUg9HAOjaa	Based on her performance, Tatiana really deserved it. <br>  The girl can sing.<br>  I am glad the judges picked her as a wild card.<br>  Even if she doesn't make the 12, she will have been given a fair chance. <br>  I am really happy for her. :)<br>  <br>  Jasmine shouldn't be there though she was terrible. <br>  They should have picked Kristen or Mishavona instead of her.|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	she sings ok but she should not be allowed to say anything and especially not allowed to laugh irritating to say the least. should have gone home. i thought simon was going to choke.|`|AA11119577	I think that there were better singers who should have been picked for the wild card.  But I have to admit, it's fun watching her go through all her emotional highs and lows. Drama Queen!!!|`|5Pgs61ePaa	I agree.

I insist on holding the camera!  My husband, who is a trained 'fine artist' has an 'ongoing art piece' that he's been working on for the past 25 years.  He 'sneaks in' on any 'tourist photos' he can, and makes funny faces, or the V for Victory sign and then moves out of the picture as quickly as possible.  He has 'no record' of how many pictures he's gotten into, but he does this whenever we are out and about, and can imagine everyone noticing him, comparing pictures and wondering 'who is this man and why is he in these pictures?'  It's harmless fun ... and sort of the opposite of your question, yet it also 'fits' in many ways!|`|grifjdr0aa	no i hate pictures period|`|KaAXJJo8aa	of course :)|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	no|`|7l0XmyZwaa	it's good practice.|`|c85782b5ed49c318025b667d07068015aa	I've never been particularly fond of striking a pose...or having my picture taken, in general.  Even so, photographs taken when a person isn't posing tend to be more "real"; they capture one's natural expressions and reveal her/his true emotions...and those are the snapshots that usually remain forever etched in our minds.|`|BC1VXQjWaa	I pose for satellite pictures.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	Does mooning randomly out of your living room window count?|`|oOVAbKPmaa	Sorry, but I can't believe this question got this many answers!

oVxr5B3Eaa	haha, me and a group of friends went through that phase in grade 10. Do you do the crazy make up as well? I sure did. I wish I had pictures but I dont. <br>  Some of us stuck with the style and some dropped it (I dropped it) but I don't remember being liked any differently between the two phases... though I was pretty depressed when I went through my gothic phase. <br>  Wear whatever you want but don't change your style to conform to a fad (like when dressing "gothic".. don't say, i have to wear THESE shoes because I'm Gothic,,, just wear the ones you want)..<br>  <br>  Though there are also a range of styles within goth. There is the corset wearing, shiny haired pretty girl, that actually looks like she cares somewhat about her appearance, and then there is the girl who just wears ripped up old whatever that doesn't fit... but wears it because it's black and looks like death. <br>  I mean... you could wear a corset shirt and have really nice black hair and some black jeans and it would look really cute :)|`|NJfpY7nIaa	I don't believe in labeling. <br>  I also don't judge people on what they wear or their appearance. <br>  Everyones fashion or style is part of their individual self...it's a expression. What you choose to express is yours to decide. It's not my place to call that "weird". So no, I bet you're a smart, sweet, and awesome girl. Have confidence and be happy about how you choose to express yourself...do it with dignity. Don't think of yourself as weird. You think others are judging you but, really it's you whom is judging yourself.<br>  <br>  People whom associate the color Black with bad things or dark things...or as a person above said "mentally ill" are just being naive.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	you put tour self down too much i think you should wear what ever makes you comfortable  the gothic look is not a total weird out you might look really good  who cares what guys think  they probably just are afraid of you cuz your beautiful.|`|ezT7xruoaa	most girls have a gothic phase, but it will stop eventually. i don't think you could find a job easily if you were a goth for the rest of your life.|`|JQZzI49Paa	no way.

I'm not exactly gothic, but I like them anyway.  <br>  In fact I just got engaged to one.  <br>  Best advice though, just be yourself, gothic, not gothic, colors, black, whatever....let someone like you for you, not for what you're trying to be.<br>  If they only like the fake you, is it worth being stuck with someone who doesn't like the real you?  No, that's not fair for either of you.|`|rGip5hMEaa	don't you dare go back!the undead look is very cool.it adds mystery to you.if people don't like it,then your around the wrong people.be how ever you want.nothing weird about it.if it's what you like.but then you have to define weird.we are all weird in our own ways.|`|1iXvphNYaa	The ones I've met have been very cool. Seems most of them love cats, but you'd be wise to not piss them off or they're more than likely to knife you just because they always seem to pull one out of thin air.

Peace. :)|`|HlKoGQGNaa	I'm incredibly pale, with hair that's almost black.<br>  I don't wear black that much, but I don't dress to impress.<br>  I've never had a boyfriend, but I don't think too much of myself either.<br>  So, I wouldn't know.|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	if thats what you like, then thats what you like, i have no problem with it nor do i think its weird. i have a friend who is gothic. they're people like everyone else...|`|Zzumj5HDaa	Continue to be who you want to be.

euZRbiA2aa	Not a copy but very influenced they have always admitted that.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I AGREE WITH COL XD<br>  <br>  I think they are just hugely influenced but not copying them. <br>  <br>  I like Oasis far better than the Beatles, although thats pretty irrelevant.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Yes I do,  I thought that the first time I heard them on the radio.  Not a huge fan of Oasis.|`|URO3gDXcaa	wanna be's.  not a copy.|`|AGP2dI6uaa	Man, f*ck the Beatles and f*ck Oasis.

aJfBtT9iaa	1. i own both i like true magic my fav song "Thug is a drug" actually i like them both equally <br>  2. Havent listened to it<br>  3.

More raw.<br>  3) I believe it will be above satisfactory at the least. His CD's are always very creative and intelligent. <br>  4) G-Unit, unfortunately.<br>  5) Campbell's Soup is delicious. How dare you. No, the root of all evil is power, and money=power.<br>  6) I appreciated 808's for what it was and i enjoyed it. So, if Mos Def did something similar I would probably still like it. I enjoyed New Danger, and that was a bit experimental.<br>  7) See prior questions.<br>  8) No. Like I said, "Vaudeville Villain" was his best CD in my opinion, and that was when he was Viktor Vaughn.<br>  9) Ya, myself. Regardless of anyone's opinion, I will listen to Lil Wayne because it is entertaining and fun. That's what music is supposed to be like. I also really love Talib Kweli. Maybe it's a screwed up dichotomy but whatever lol.<br>  10) Hip-Hop wouldn't see me coming. Muahahaha... lol|`|bribxhsdaa	1. New Danger<br>  2. Haven't seen.<br>  3. Should be solid.<br>  4.

v86sOx7Gaa	I work at a spa doing nails and massage. I haven't seen almost half of my regular clients since the recession began. Even though I've tried discounts nothing has seemed to work.|`|geJM58L2aa	I'm unemployed.  I lost my job January 17 and have applied to over 50 jobs since with no results.  Unemployment has given me an extremely hard time so I've yet to recieve any help from them.  I don't qualify for food stamps because I'm a student.  I have a negative balance checking account and over-limit credit card.  So the recession has made my life a disaster.  It's up to my husband to cover all of our bills which is near impossible since they keep giving him less and less hours.<br>  <br>  Isn't it beautiful?|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Had to put off having a baby. I got married last summer and we wanted to start a family right away since I'm 28 and he's 34 already...And now my carefully laid plans are out the window. :(|`|9it5nGJjaa	Made me poorer than what I was before. Haven't bought new clothes in 5 years.|`|53f1d35346c26102777b3d43102257c3aa	It has made it harder for me to go to school. <br>  The mortgage payments are insane, my cars suck, my job sucks, and the time to buy new clothing is closing in.<br>  But then again compared to the situation that other people are in, maybe its not so bad|`|zAAeLFLuaa	I cant afford Milk|`|CZ8szX0jaa	so far not at all.

So, you see they will go where ever they want to go.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	This is a pretty deep group of talent you got here.  However, Peter Murphy truly lives up to his nickname as the Godfather of Goth.  There's simply no replicating that amazing voice.  As great as Love & Rockets were, it's too bad that Bauhaus couldn't stick around a little longer.  After Murphy went solo, he seemed to go out of his way to tone down the Goth theatrics from his voice, which was his signature card.|`|AA11166769	Oh, that's a tough one! I'm torn between the Cure and Bauhaus, but I guess I'll go with the Cure, since their stuff seems more influential and seems to transcend time more.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Peter Murphy for the music.  Fat Bob for the look.|`|euZRbiA2aa	peter murphy,i wouldnt even class the cure as a goth band.<br>  EDIT well i was a teen at that time in the uk i would have put the cure in the new wave bracket maybe now they are considered goth but at the start of the 80s they where not.|`|RQtYkwXgaa	*chuckle* much to his dismay I would say Uncle Andy (Andrew Eldritch)<br>  <br>  But of those three I would have to say Peter Murphy for the overall music...<br>  <br>  But we will all remember Rozz... and huggles fat bob.|`|4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	I love all three, but I'd have to go with Rozz.

I don't think the Cure are exactly Goth, just emotionally charged.|`|T7Xn2SQyaa	hehehe, I just tried to answer this and sent an email to you, then go back and found it re-posted.  my answer is still the same, Peter Murphy by far.

vBwH8X8caa	Hi, Angie!<br>  <br>  The song "Helter Skelter" is about a popular amusement park ride in 1950's and '60's England, called a Helter Skelter, where one climbs a tall tower and then slides down a spiral slide to the bottom.  If you listen to the words to the song, you can tell this is right.<br>  <br>  Charles Manson, probably with more than a little help from LSD, mistranslated the words to this song, as well as many others from the Beatles' White Album, to tell a tale of an Armageddon-like battle between racist whites, non-racist whites, and blacks, which he called Helter Skelter.  The Tate and LaBianca murders were staged by Manson in order to provoke Helter Skelter, during which Manson planned to hide with his cohorts in a soon-to-be-built hidden underground city (the "bottom of the slide" in the song) at the ranch he was renting in Death Valley.  After Helter Skelter killed everyone else off, he and his merry band would emerge from their underground city to rule the world (the "top of the slide").<br>  <br>  What a sicko, eh?<br>  <br>  But what a great song!  I play it over and over.  And the Manson saga is a gripping tale of the 60's.  I highly recommend Vincent Bugliosi's book (see "sources" below). I'll never forget the day in 1975 I skipped school to read it cover to cover, chemically enhanced, while playing the White Album.  Mind blowing!|`|Z7RWz496aa	Helter Skelter came from a music paper's rave review of a new single by the who|`|Ow6lKFXiaa	Serial killer Charles Manson and and his followers called themselves the Manson Family. On August 9, 1969 they broke in during a party and brutally murdered actress Sharon Tate, who was 8 months pregnant, and all of her guests.  According to Manson, he was inspired by the song Helter Skelter by the Beatles that he interpreted as prophecies about the breakout of racial war.  He believed the murders were part of the prophecy and it was The Family's destiny to help fulfill the prophecy.<br>  <br>  Quote: "On the morning of August 9, 1969 in a mansion located within an exclusive enclave of Los Angeles known as Benedict Canyon five people were murdered. Among those found dead maid the following morning was actress Sharon Tate (wife of film director Roman Polanski) and coffee heiress Abigail Folger. Some bodies were strewn across the estate, but Sharon Tate, who was more than eight months pregnant, laid dead with a rope around her neck on the living room floor. Graffiti found written in blood at the murder scene said, "Death to Pigs." <br>  <br>  On the night of August 9, 1969 another multiple murder shook Los Angeles. A wealthy couple, Rosemary and Leno LaBianca, were stabbed to death in their home on the edge of Hollywood. <br>  <br>  These grisly acts during the summer of 1969 came to be known as the "Tate-LaBianca Murders." Three months later police arrested a group of cult members for the murders who called themselves "The Family" (a.k.a. the Manson Family, the devoted followers of Charles Manson). "<br>  <br>  Quote: "Charles Manson and The Family seemed obsessively fixated upon their leader's dark vision of a coming apocalypse. It is believed that Charles Manson envisioned the Tate-LaBianca murders as a pivotal point in a coming apocalyptic drama. Through these deaths Manson hoped a race war would begin that would engulf society and thus initiate the fulfillment of his prophetic view."<br>  <br>  Quote:  "The murders perpetrated by members of Charles Manson's "Family" were inspired in part by Manson's prediction of Helter Skelter, an apocalyptic war he believed would arise from tension over racial relations between blacks and whites.[1] This "chimerical vision," as it was termed by the court that heard Manson's appeal from his conviction for the Tate-LaBianca killings,[2] involved reference to music of The Beatles and to the New Testament's Book of Revelation.[3]"<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I had trouble composing properly so relied, instead, on quotes. The Professor did a way better job than my sorry attempt.   A much better, and more concise, explaination.  (thumbs up)
TcaWW4OBaa	ohh it is so true! people think we all live in the desert, eat platypus and koala for supper every night, we have a population of about 400 and that there are kangaroos jumping down the streets. nobody believs us when we tell them "we are just like your country, we arent savages, we do have electricity, and not all of us work on a farm 5 kilometers away from the nearest neghbour"<br>  <br>  it is pretty ridiculous some of the things we hear when someone comes to Australia for the first time. like the people who think we all speak like "g'day, me old cobber mate". i wonder who did that recently... : )<br>  <br>  i must admit that i myself am an immigrant, sadly born and bred in blackpool of all places...but still, the rest of us dont have stupid accents. it appears only past prime ministers seem to have communicated through that strange dialect. thankyou bob hawke...|`|z4slPzgSaa	Haha!

L9Q6r42Qaa	Gregarious, upbeat and confident, Sagittarians usually have many friends, but their impulsiveness can throw more security-loving types off kilter. Most Sagittarians are brave and generous, and they usually have a desire to help humanity in some way.<br>  <br>  Cheerful and Positive<br>  Sagittarians are extroverted, cheerful and optimistic. They believe that things will turn out well, and they trust much to luck. Not much gets them down and they usually rebound quickly from depression, illness or stressful life events. Most enjoy robust health and when they do experience medical problems, it is often the result of over-indulging and risk taking.<br>  <br>  Risk Takers<br>  Sagittarians are not prone to anxiety or worry unless the ascendant falls in a more anxiety-prone sign, which makes them natural risk takers. They are inclined to do things that are damaging to their health, or even take physical risks that can endanger their lives. Sagittarians leap before looking and land themselves in various scrapes. However, they have a last-minute luck that often saves them in the end, and they’ll turn around and do it all over again.<br>  <br>  Addictive and Sensation Seeking<br>  Sagittarians seek the next challenge and the next big adrenaline rush, and in some cases this sensation seeking can lead to drug abuse. Additionally, although they are energetic, physically strong, muscular and naturally athletic, many become fat or even obese through overeating and drinking. Alcoholism is a common Sagittarian ailment, as they don’t know when to stop and don’t listen to the signals their bodies send them.<br>  <br>  Generous and Careless with Money<br>  Sagittarians are altruistic and will sacrifice time, energy and money to help others. They’re generous to a fault and will give their last dollar to someone in need or spend it all on drinks for everyone in the room. Many Sagittarians have big, impractical plans for making money, as well as a penchant for gambling. They win more often than most, but when they lose, they lose big.<br>  <br>  Love of Travel<br>  Sagittarians love to travel and often believe that it is a better educator than school. They like to meet people in foreign lands and learn foreign languages. When traveling, they’d rather camp out with the locals than set up in a fancy hotel. Most Sagittarians also like outdoor pursuits such as hiking, camping or kayaking.<br>  <br>  Suited to Nontraditional Employment<br>  Sagittarians often have trouble with traditional 9-5 careers. They will not follow the rules if they don’t believe that the rules are right and just. They have the courage to speak up for their convictions and fight for what they believe in, which can lead to clashes with authority. They are also very physical and have trouble with staying put in an office chair for hours on end. Sagittarians have a constant need for movement and novelty, and these requirements should be taken into account when planning a career.<br>  <br>  Opinionated and Open-Minded<br>  A Sagittarian quirk is to be open-minded on most subjects but fiercely opinionated on a few pet topics. Some Sagittarians can be tyrannical and bullying, insisting that others conform to their beliefs. This sign is known to have a self-righteous streak. However, most are open-minded and easy going, not worrying much about the things other people say.<br>  <br>  Exaggerated Need for Freedom<br>  Sagittarians value freedom far above security. As a result, unless the ascendant falls in the sign of Cancer or one of the fixed signs, many don’t settle down in a relationship too easily. They find the majority of partners too clingy or restrictive, and even those who do settle down will look to the horizon with longing from time to time. This is not a domestic sign. When they do stay put, Sagittarians tend to be messy around the house and most are not particularly good cooks.<br>  <br>  Tactless and Insensitive<br>  Although Sagittarians are good at creating fun times and cheering people up, their bluntness can sometimes have the opposite effect. Sagittarians can be honest to the point of cruelty, and will upset more sensitive individuals with their often accurate but not very diplomatic statements. Most Sagittarians can take the truth about themselves, at least more of the truth than others can, and so they seek to impose truths on others even when sensitivity is called for. This is the source of much strife in Sagittarian relationships. Additionally, some Sagittarians have a tendency to exaggerate and brag, which can put others off.<br>  <br>  Friendly and Philosophical<br>  Sagittarians are good judges of character, but they’ll hang around with almost anyone, even someone they think is not a very nice person, if they find that person interesting. Deep, profound and expansive subjects are favoured by Sagittarians. They like philosophizing on important ideas and don’t care for small talk.<br>  <br>  Spiritually Minded<br>  Sagittarians usually enhance their minds with a lot of reading. Many feed their mystical sides with books that tackle the big questions in life as they seek the|`|d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	Sagittarius<br>  November 22 - December 21<br>  Sagittarius, the ninth Sign of the Zodiac, is the home of the wanderers of the Zodiac. It's not a mindless ramble for these folks, either. Sagittarians are truth-seekers, and the best way for them to do this is to hit the road, talk to others and get some answers. Knowledge is key to these folks, since it fuels their broad-minded approach to life. The Sagittarian-born are keenly interested in philosophy and religion, and they find that these disciplines aid their internal quest. At the end of the day, what Sagittarians want most is to know the meaning of life, and if they accomplish this while feeling free and easy, all the better.<br>  <br>  It's the Archer which represents Sagittarians, although in this case it's a Centaur (half man, half beast) which is flinging the arrows. Centaurs were the intellectuals of ancient Roman mythology, and Sagittarians are quick to consider themselves their modern-day counterparts. Those born under this Sign are clear thinkers and choose to look at the big picture most of the time. They also like it when others agree with their well-thought-out point of view. The alternative to this, for better or for worse, is a Sag who can become argumentative and blunt. That's not to say that these folks are intransigent -- Archers will listen to what others have to say, in keeping with the Mutable Quality assigned to this Sign. Indeed, Sagittarians are enthusiastic consumers of information (and enthusiastic in general), the better to get the answers they need. It's also a good idea to give Sags lots of room to explore their world. Once these folks start to feel hemmed in, they'll become impatient and difficult. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter. In ancient Roman times, Jupiter was the King of the Gods, and most Sagittarians would say that the royal pedigree has been passed on to them. The Sag-born are generous and just, much like a noble leader. These folks are also expansive in their thoughts, as well as in their approach. Sags are forever reaching -- for knowledge, understanding and answers. They are outspoken in their beliefs, at times to the point of exaggeration. This may be due to their unflinching optimism. Sags are also a lucky bunch, thanks to Jupiter's golden glow. They're quick to take a gamble on things, feeling both lucky and smart. While the process of exploration is what fuels Sagittarians (and translating that to others as a teacher and philosopher), they need to be aware of their tendency to procrastinate. Those born under this Sign can be quite self-indulgent since things come so easily to them (thanks to their charming and sociable natures). Smart Archers, however, will catch themselves in time, the better to continue their good work.<br>  <br>  The Element associated with Sagittarius is Fire. Just as a fire can move quickly and uncontrollably, so can Sagittarians as they flit from one thing to the next, never looking back. For the Sag-born, it's all about action and adventure (and, hopefully, conclusions). These folks love their physicality and are often athletic, and certainly full of stamina. Life for these folks is played full-on, which is why it's chock-full of experiences. Archers are outgoing, enthusiastic and tend to overstep their bounds as a result, falling prey to the likes of foot-in-mouth disease. They can talk so fast (and so much) that they don't process the full weight of what they're saying, leading to the occasional hurt feeling. Often, however, their words serve to inspire others and to get things going. Yes, Sagittarians are straight-ahead folks who are curious, spiritual and true believers. The fact that they attract others with ease should be no surprise, since they have a great sense of fun and enjoy a good time. They don't lack for confidence, either, not a whit! High-spirited Sags love to socialize -- with an ever-changing crew. <br>  <br>  The athleticism of Sags lends itself to challenging sports, and they definitely know they're up to the task. That's why you're likely to find them in an around-the-world solo boat race or climbing up the highest peaks (where they should be mindful of their legs and hips). No stretch is too big for a Sag, if only because these folks know they're ready (and lucky to boot). Mental games such as chess or debate also fuel the Sag's mood. Moody colors they'll wear, since they favor rich maroon and navy hues. When it comes to love games, the Archer is playful, flirtatious and always on top.<br>  <br>  The great strength of the Sagittarius-born is their philosophical, wide-open and curious nature. These folks seek both knowledge and truth, and they are eager to share their explorations with others. Their optimistic and generous spirit makes them a pleasure to have around.|`|0iAGnjFvaa	you're a fire sign<br>  <br>  you're simply ambitious and passionate, not afraid of taking chances, not usually shy at all, very social and brave, a good people-pleaser|`|X98qlf2iaa	It means you were born in late november or december.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't believe any other answers if I were you.

I do that to my BF ;) That shows how much he loves you. Scorpios are very passionate, and once they are truly in love they will show a lot of effection and attention to their loved ones. I just love to look at my BF, when i look in to his big gorgeous eyes I see the world in them, I touch his face, I hold and hug him all the time. It comes naturaly to me to do that. And I do love it when he falls asleep in my arms. I love to look at him all peaceful and kiss his face.

This incident sparks a life change, and as a result Sunako shuns all forms of beauty, both in herself as well as in life. Concerned by her change for the worst, Sunako's aunt, the owner of a beautiful mansion where four very handsome students live, offers the guys free rent in her mansion if they can turn Sunako into a "perfect lady<br>  <br>  ?[VAMPIRE KNIGHT and GUILTY]?http://www.animekiwi.com/vampire...<br>  Yuki's earliest memory is of a stormy night in winter, wherein she was attacked by a vampire... And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adapted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend who’s hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. And the price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death.<br>  <br>  ?[JUNJOUN ROMANTICA]? [yaoi/shounen-ai though]<br>  Misaki is suddenly having some unexpected and odd problems. What started as a need for some college entrance exam tutoring has somehow led him to being romanced by a suave older man who also happens to be his big brother’s best friend. Confused by all of his brand new emotions, Misaki struggles to deal with his suddenly very odd life. And if that wasn’t enough, his suitor, Usami, has plenty of issues of his own. A man-child who decorates his room in giant teddy bears and toys, Usami is a famous novelist who also writes steamy boys’ love novels on the side. When Misaki cracks open one of these books and reads sentences like “Misaki licks every inch of Usami’s hot body”…well, let’s just say that all hell breaks loose.<br>  <br>  ?[INUYASHA]?http://www.animekiwi.com/i...<br>  Kagome leads a fairly normal life, in spite of her weird family. Her house is a thousand-year-old Japanese temple, and her grandfather talks about the history of the house endlessly. Legend has it that the old well on the temple grounds keeps a vicious ancient monster at bay; Kagome never believed those legends, until now. The well opens up and sucked Kagome inside - transporting her to an ancient time of enchanted forests and giant demons.<br>  <br>  Kagome is soon confronted by her odd resemblance to Kikuyo, the girl who controlled the magical Shikon no Tama talisman and imprisoned the legendary half-demon Inu-Yasha. Upon entering this fantasy world, Kagome is attacked by a demon hunting the Shikon no Tama; she unwittingly releases Inu-Yasha from his imprisonment, only to find that he's no hero.<br>  <br>  ?[GRAVITATION]? contains shounen ai <a href="http://www.animekiwi.com/gravitation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.animekiwi.com/gravitation/</a><br>  All Shuichi ever dreamed about was following in the footsteps of his pop idol.

Unfortunately, the studio deadlines are looming and Shuichi still hasn't finished the lyrics for any of the songs. What he needs is a little inspiration... but he's been running a little low in that department lately.

VCIexeqyaa	Mid 90's definetely.|`|AA11166769	It began to take off in the early 90s, but it was hugely popular in the mid 90s.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Early to mid 90's was height of its popularity|`|7dbWSo9xaa	it was born in the early 90's, but it wasn't until the mid-90's when every rock station in America was playing a ton of Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirbana, Soundgarden, etc.|`|1UKr652Uaa	Yeah, grunge music definitely peaked in the early nineties, and was still popular in the mid-90s. It started to become less popular after Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994.|`|dqCTS60raa	yes definitely it was the music from the 90's bands such as Nirvana, Pearl jam, Sound Garden were big hero from the Grunge move|`|OTFzJbaMaa	late 90's<br>  from like 97-99|`|8Initt1aaa	1994 was the year REALLY. That was the year Kurt Cobain killed himself and grunge was at the peak of its popularity.|`|sGwMKlswaa	it started at late 80's but every one liked grunge in 93 untill 97, thats when every body started to like the foo's.
VEzNOVSPaa	I love English accents.|`|AA11569882	Well, I have one myself.  It depends on what English accent though, some of them are just downright awful.|`|muX5G72Vaa	I have one too. Not too keen on it myself.<br>  <br>  : )|`|wZloBlGlaa	to tell you the truth, i have no idea what an english accent is lol<br>  <br>  well i've probably heard it i just didn't know what it's called|`|wxXguyK3aa	I like them a lot.<br>  <br>  I live in America, and one of my professors is English, and he told us that someone once told him he spoke English very well for a foreigner.|`|Cq1Qsg8Vaa	i like english accents on everyone but me. i kinda have a gaelic/english/japanese accent...its odd. :P<br>  <br>  ?|`|BP7SfeGPaa	honestly and frankly speaking NO ah caz i hate British English Accent but I love American English Accent More N i have AEA one|`|maVptaMZaa	English accents are so diverse.  From north in Cumbria to Newcastle and from Birmingham to London the accents vary significantly.  I think most people only think of the south east accent when they think of an English accent and are not aware of the many regional accents in between.  There is a distinct accent in London between north and south of the river Thames that's how diverse we are here in England I think it's great!|`|IIKwBSrxaa	You're British too??? Damn, you're perfect.<br>  <br>  But you're asking if I like English accents... it all depends - on whether or not you like the educated East Coast accent.  I asked a question one time if English people liked American accents, and one person said educated East Coast accents were "tolerable".<br>  <br>  If you think my accent is "tolerable", then I find your accent to be incredibly sexy (me-ow).|`|5C2B23Qnaa	I have an english accent :) <br>  when i went to greece the people there were like 'i love your accent' lol :)|`|VU97XJzfaa	Yeah, baby. Talk to me ;)|`|mA59dkjXaa	So do i and i think their okk|`|HlKoGQGNaa	Yes.|`|VJREeIgNaa	Why of course dear..splendid|`|OCMSTxYfaa	yes..in women...men...eeehhhh..not so much|`|0ioly31paa	Some. I'm English (From Newcastle) myself, so yeah.<br>  I like the really original English accent, like Keira Knightley's or Emma Watson's.|`|mEMRv3MVaa	Haha I live in America, and everyone here sure loves them :)<br>  <br>  My friends and I may immitate them sometimes. We think they sound so cool!|`|Fp2iP53laa	english accents r hot =]|`|fZdBaMl1aa	OMG yes I love English accents!!!|`|fHTYcUhXaa	lmao  theyre halariouss:) luv emm but some ppl get annoyingg lol|`|n0aPurUpaa	love, love, LOVE them ;)|`|yuiXfQqbaa	yes i have one myself
5KcUyLFRaa	I went thru a phase of thinking at night Houdini was chained up in my wardrobe. Ridiculous I know. I would just know he was in there, but was too scared to open the wardobe doors to check. I think it started when I caught a bit of a documentary on him my parents were watching.|`|zmpQbBxFaa	I was told about a ghost story in the playground about the green lady who ate children when they were sleeping...went home from school to find my mum had painted my bedroom....green...omg I was terrified...my mum had to redo my room in girly pink then sleep beside me for about a month I was that scared!!<br>  <br>  my sister when she was around 5, was convinced a fish (lol!) was inside her baby doll trying to kiss her...my mum had to eventually throw the doll out...<br>  <br>  unfortunately for my sister and I we have to hear these stories again and again at family do's....how embarrasing!! lol|`|d2vENVGlaa	I used to think that everybody could read my mind, so I would have to try and censor my thoughts.  I still find myself doing it and I'm seventeen.<br>  I also used to think that all space had to have some form of matter occupying it, that there was no such thing as a vacuum.  I guess it's because you would call empty space just 'air', so in my mind all empty spaces=air, and air=empty spcaes.|`|aahbhllNaa	When we were doing WW2 in Primary school i used to freak out every day when it was bed time because i thought that Hitler would come alive again and bomb my house and i would die. I was pretty self centered.|`|TqRL5PEpaa	Just the regular clowns. After watching the movie IT by Stephen King, I could never stand the sight of a clown. Even Ronald McDonald. Lol|`|hvZSKn6Eaa	I believed santa was evil and trying to kill me...<br>  <br>  This was brought on after a hallucination due to the mumps...|`|QLOCznKTaa	My mom used to tell me that if I ever wet the bed then Mr. Toilet Man was gonna bite my butt off (like on look who's talking 2) and I actually believed her so I always made sure that I got up and went|`|46a14ceb5e21165137def6a6f8a9df2eaa	Anyone with a english peaked cap was a boogyman|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	I hid behind the couch watching Rudolph when the Abominable Snowman was on the screen.|`|AA10269742	that the sun would blow up in the year 2000<br>  <br>  that i would "catch" AIDS just from drinking or eating after someone (i didn't know much about it then except that it was a deadly disease)<br>  <br>  that my hands would melt if i got bleach on them|`|DwI2MV53aa	I used to be terrified of ET and I was convinced if I was ever alone at night he would come get me.|`|s4VzPulYaa	I was always scared to go into an indoor swimming pool because I thought there was sharks in the pool!|`|fT15YEkFaa	I was sure the frankenstein monster was going to get me|`|XTWClFLQaa	That if I breathed, I would die. I tried to hold my breath as much as possible. So. Damn. Stupid.
8yE2sYGeaa	Nothing dramatically open like that<br>  <br>  I mean, Eve from Black Cat could be that<br>  I've had my doubts about Meg from Burst Angel<br>  Onizuka from GTO seems to run hot and cold<br>  Perhaps Dilandau Albatau  from Vision of Escaflowne, but he could just be flat-out insane|`|uctxzjIIaa	I'd say the title character of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is bi-polar.|`|6a212c9c778993f0ddb7d1f87cefdc91aa	Well there's Lucy/Nyu from Elfen Lied......
dFacbjIZaa	You make some good points. For one I completely agree about the Music undergoing a fundamental change circa 1967 and yes, Piper was a major and crucial part of that transition. However, even though I vastly prefer Floyd to The Beatles they were a huge part too with Sgt Peppers, as were Cream with Disreali Gears. I can't bring Myself to say that Syd was any more or less influential to the basic change in Rock that Eric Clapton and His wah wah pedal, or Lennon and McCartney lyrics and experimentations, or Jim Hendrix firestorm Guitars. The changes grew out of all of it, not just Piper At The Gates Of Dawn. <br>  <br>  Now about Syd and Floyd, yes He started it, yes he was crucial to the beginning, but Pink Floyd went way beyond anything Piper or Saucerful level with later albums like Meddle and Dark Side. I respect Syd Barret but He is not the be all and end all of Floyd to Me.|`|1UKr652Uaa	Yeah, that could be argued, however, most stuff that Pink Floyd released which has proved to be most influential on artists that came after them was released after Syd Barrett lost most of his creative control in the band to LSD. He definitely was the one who got the band moving in the beginning, but all of their material that made them famous worldwide had very little input from him, despite the fact that a lot of it was inspired by him. Just look at the liner notes from Wish You Were Here... he didn't write anything at all. I don't even think he played on that album.|`|adLSRFrZaa	I agree that Syd Barrett's influence was huge. I totally agree with much of what you say, but I think there were other very influential musicians too, like John Lennon.  I am a huge fan of the first two pink floyd albums, and a case can be made that "A Saucerful of Secrets (1968)" is both one of the first Prog albums, and also one of the first Krautrock albums - It was that influential.  However, you can't dismiss some of the Psychedelic music The Beatles were making in 1966.  For example, 'Love You Too' and 'Tomorrow Never Knows' were two great early Psychedelic rock songs off "Revolver (1966)."  I'm reluctant to say that Syd is the most influential person, especially when you consider how huge John Lennon's influence was as well.|`|cEgBZV7Caa	hell yea. almost every pink floyd song with Rodger waters is about SYD. (wish you were here). obvious.  its all about him.  if he had kept it in line then he would be one of the greatest ever.|`|3Q6aosZPaa	No. Muse guitarist/singer Matt Bellamy.|`|AQwoCjj3aa	This may be true however, Kurt Cobain brought alternative music to the main stream.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	No one person is the most influential as a musician. But Les Paul has had the greatest influnce since he first plugged in a guitar and made gigantic strides in recording systems.

bsnnEsp5aa	There is no sequal, in the final episode Suzu is seen carrying the head of his former master, he has gone insane with greif and lack of reason left to live.<br>  <br>  But it was only a disturbing scene right at the end of the anime (episode 24)<br>  <br>  The manga also ends the same way, infact the anime doesn't stray far from the manga (the only real difference is the comedy episodes in the anime are non-existant in the manga as the manga takes a very serious drama-based stance, not that this is a bad thing ofcourse, I love both)<br>  But they both end with Suzu seen being driven insane.<br>  <br>  Its kind of sad I think, because prior to that he was a likable character, having a sad story and even though he acted coldly at times, he was actually a relatively normal ambitious boy (reflective of Tetsu, just placed in different cercumstances)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D

AA10261517	I pretty much agree with everything you said.  I find them absolutely ridiculous.  Being religious is fine but they take it WAY too far!!  I just think they're insane, its like they're not even from this planet. Their kids are too sheltered and will never know what its like in the "real world."  They just dont have a clue about ANYTHING. And why would you want to live like that?  All of the shopping, laundry and cooking plus all of the crap they go through when they travel...just crazy!!  I dont think God would want people to live like that.  They say they enjoy life but seriously, any normal person would not enjoy that kind of life.|`|2MNFi5agaa	I completely disagree.  I think the Duggars may seem a little over the top religiously, but they are instilling wonderful values in their children.  They are showing their children every day what it's like to have a loving relationship.  Their children will grow up to be responsible adults who will probably always help the underpriviledged.  Frankly, the way the world is today, I think we need more people like the Duggars!|`|23e630eaa85701f632ca9f2dca6b8db1aa	Let me respond to your question with another question - Do you know of any other family with 17 (now 18) children who AREN'T that religious?|`|btvwigRSaa	Omg they are sooooo unbeliveably annoying!|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	i dont like how religious they are, but they seem like nice people<br>  <br>  and taht mom is insane. i admire her parenting skills, she is so calm and collected|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	I feel that the kids will be lost in this world as they grow.

Islam does not promote racism, terrorism, violence of any sort. It is fair and wants people to be pure. Islam does not force anyone to do anything. It is up to people if they want to believe it or not. You should check out everything islam believes in and you'll see that it is very good. Nowhere does it say that you should go and kill people for no reason. Forget what these other silly people tell you because they're too gullible and believe everything that the media tells them. <br>  Anyways its up to you. Good luck!|`|uBxvR6FJaa	Take the “Islam - Is it right for me?” Test.<br>  Don’t worry - it’s an easy True/False test.<br>  Answer the following honestly:<br>  <br>  1) Muhammad, the only one who could hear Allah speaking to him, received personal, often sexual and tailor-made advantages that applied specifically and uniquely to him (33:37-38, 33:50-53). Muhammad used the Quran to control his wives during his life (33:30-33) and even after his death (33:53). He told his wives that they will burn in hell if they betray him (66:3-5, 66:10).<br>  Muhammad was incorruptible and his motives were pure - Yes / No<br>  <br>  2) Muhammad was a warlord (Quran, Ch. 8 “Spoils of War”). He said: Fight the idol-worshipers, capture, besiege and ambush them until they convert to Islam (9:5). Allah will humiliate them and give you victory (9:14). Enjoy the spoils of war (8:69). If you flee from battle you are condemned to hell (8:16). He promised his soldiers spoils of war (48:19-20) if they conquer Khaybar and Makka. After the Jewish tribe Banu Qurayza betrayed Muhammad, he killed some and captured others. His men took their land, houses and wealth (33:26-27). Muhammad gave himself permission to marry women who were captured or made widows by his advancing army (33:50).<br>  Muhammad was a “messenger of peace” - Yes / No<br>  <br>  3) Apparently, being a prophet of Allah is not fully satisfying. Muhammad’s life-work was so unfulfilling that he needed more than one wife in order to feel complete. He was on the most important mission in history but he still had so much spare-time that he was able to marry many wives. During his practice of polygamy, Muhammad married his ex-daughter-in-law, his first-cousin, women whom he considered “spoils of war”, women for whom he had payed dowries and any woman who “gave herself to the Prophet” if he desired her (33:37, 33:50). In addition to his wives, Muhammad was allowed to marry slave-women whom his “right hand possessed” (33:52). This is the man who said that we should care about God alone because all of our sexual desires will be fulfilled in the afterlife.<br>  Muhammad, a holy man, “needed” all those wives - Yes / No<br>  <br>  4) The Quran is full of sexism (4:34, 2:223, 2:282, 12:28) and it allows men to use emotional and physical punishment to discipline their disobedient wives (4:34).<br>  As the Quran says, men are “a degree above” women (2:228) - Yes / No<br>  <br>  5) The Quran claims that, except for a few, all Jews are treacherous (5:13) and “listeners of falsehood” who are “greedy for illicit gain” (5:42). The worst enemies of the believers are the Jews and the idol-worshipers (5:82). Jews and Christians are only friends to each other (5:51).<br>  Allah needs to use stereotypes in order to simplify a complex world - Yes / No<br>       <br>  6) Allah takes credit for “natural” events such as lightning (13:13) flight (16:79) shooting stars (67:5) and earthquakes (16:15). The Quran says that the night sky is used to “veil” daytime (7:54) and that sperm comes from between the backbone and ribs (86:7).<br>  The Quran is a modern, scientific book - Yes / No<br>  <br>  7) Allah could have banned slavery outright in the Quran, but left the issue up to Muslims to interpret as they saw fit. The result? Muslims practiced slavery (30:28), as well as sexual-slavery (23:6, 70:30), victimizing tens of millions of people, for over a thousand years. Muslims made it easy to find non-believers to enslave. They designated areas in Africa in which they would not preach Islam - so that slaves captured there would not turn out to be fellow Muslims. The Muslim’s most holy country, Saudi Arabia, did not ban slavery until 1962.<br>  God would allow his believers to own slaves - Yes / No<br>  <br>  End of Test.<br>  <br>  If you marked “No” for ANY of the preceding questions, Islam is NOT right for you.|`|iJVk625naa	1-It comes from the word salam and salam means peace.<br>  2-It is fair and wants people to be pure.<br>  3-Believe in all the prophets because they were all sent to convince and warn people and tell them about heaven and hell so we never attack any religion.<br>  4-Rich people should help poor people. <br>  5-A muslim should be good to people.<br>  6-Allah forgives the person about anything except to worship someone other or with allah.<br>  if you ask your heart you will feel that it is the true religion.|`|udk7yYj0aa	I'm Muslim..&& I Think Islam At First Is Very Confusing, But If You Study It With Your Mind && Heart It Is The Most Purest Religion ( No Offence To Any Other Religions).

However, two days later when his father came home from work, Little Johnny had tears in his eyes as he said, "Mommy almost died this morning." fearing something terrible had happened, his father questioned,<br>  <br>  "What do you mean Johnny? Tell Daddy!"<br>  "Well", mumbled Little Johnny, "Soon after you left for work this morning I saw Mommy lying on the floor with her legs in the air and she was shouting, 'Oh Jesus! I'm coming, I'm coming!' And, if it hadn't been for the neighbor who was holding her down, she would have gone to Heaven just like Buddy did."|`|PSczDW8jaa	Haha! I really like these!

WtTUNC8Naa	I still think kids are having sex at very young ages. I mean look at the statistics of girls that get pregnant. Granted i lost my virginity when i was 16, but im also 24 years old. That was years ago and times have changed. I think kids should wait, and they should be taught better sex education. But that doesnt help that much, kids are going to be kids. they think they know it all. Parents cant stop it, neither can teachers. Peer pressure can be a b#$@$. But it happens. There is no preventing kids from having sex, just making them aware.|`|Z51fjE2Raa	Well... going by olden times- the boys are having it very young.<br>  <br>  Girls, however, would often be married by the age of 14/15 in tudor times... hence girls starrting puberty way younger (Sad to say- but the un puberty ones weren't married- thus their genes didnt continue- or they died) <br>  <br>  I think since people live longer it is waaay too young. <br>  <br>  But the silly children fancy themselves in 'luff' and so going around shagging anything that moves.

When a new classmate acquaintance of his, Sekai Saionji, discovers his secret crush on Kotonoha, she helps introduce both of them to each other and over time they grow closer and agree to date. However in spite of her proud and triumphant matchmaking efforts, Sekai inadvertently becomes jealous of the new couple, having also developed feelings toward Makoto.<br>  <br>  The following afternoon on her way home at the nearby train station in front of the school, Sekai finds Makoto waiting for Kotonoha to rendezvous for a date. He sits with her and reiterates his appreciation for her help, and feeling heavily indebted, offers repayment anyway he can. Though she believes he is overreacting, Sekai decides to redeem her obligation by placing a kiss on his lips as her train pulls in; quickly rushing into an open passenger car and happily bidding a dumbstruck Makoto luck on his date.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's a game but they made it into a anime.

dwzfjlJraa	Personally I don't think your horoscope will play a factor in your relationship it'll either work or it wont give it a shot.|`|7r6rS54Oaa	I don't know if this is any indication but...<br>  I'm a pisces female and I have always had alot of strong relationships with capricorns.  Almost all of my friends through life have been capricorns and I am married to a capricorn now.  I have been together with him 10 years and married to him 5.  I think horoscopes play a role in compatiablilty but as far as lasting I guess it will depend on a lot from then the stars.  Just for fun though I looked up capricorn female/pisces male compatiablity for you, check out the link!
CnwgssHzaa	I think I do. I really wish i could control it, but it seems as if i am liking a different guy all the time. In the end i start obsessing over the guy, thinking that he is the only one right for me, but then i get over him. Next thing i know, i am all over another guy.

Rp6cxboYaa	In old west time, they had two extra days between Thursday and Friday.  Unions fought very hard for the removal of these two days, claiming that a 7-day work week was unbearable.<br>  <br>  Or he had a horse named either Thursday or Friday.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	Thursday and Friday are his B***HES!!!<br>  <br>  he did it with no lube and unprotected.|`|5I4imquJaa	Friday is the name of the horse he rides on........<br>  <br>  :)|`|jdJAzuDXaa	his horses name is friday
EXZh0t5Eaa	The correct answer is a twenty-cent piece and a dime. I suppose though since a "half-dime" is not technically a "nickel" someone may argue a quarter and a half dime, although they would just be putting there two cents in. I like your question cause not many people would know the answer. Thanks for posting it.|`|BE12KJZ3aa	a quarter and a nickel.|`|5I4imquJaa	i dunno...im english and we deal in pounds sterling...... lol|`|fMKPp6qkaa	a quarter abd a nickel. if one isn't a nickel, the other is. duh. this is old|`|hlUOTUohaa	three dimes. <br>  or<br>  thrity pennies.
qv5YTx5kaa	Ember to Inferno and Ascendancy are two of my favorite albums, but The Crusade was a weak Metallica imitation that sucks. Shogun is better than The Crusade but not as good as Ascendancy. They're ok, but i wouldn't pay to see them|`|Zxl8oyIraa	The Crusade album was most excellent in every way, but as soon as another CD came out they became screamo metal rejects. i was disappointed.|`|uesAHPidaa	I used to be the biggest trivium fan for a while. But, drifted out of the i like everything on the crusade thou , AMAZING album.|`|Hw8gCPbwaa	They were great when the sounded more like Trivium and less like a Metallica copy. The Ascendancy and Ember to Inferno were great albums, everything after that was disappointing. They should go back to being Trivium.|`|zsUsZcbpaa	OMG they awesome :)|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Who?????|`|24NlvSCvaa	They p0wn, amazing band, i drifted away from them for a while but im kinda listening a bit again. last album wasn't so great, Best album was Ember to inferno. :D|`|c52F2UnYaa	I rather like this band, but the harsh vocals sucks, their<br>  music is cool but I like only when he sings with clean vocal,<br>  he must learn how to scream|`|goo7zzqWaa	he sings better than he screams.<br>  eg, the chorus of 'pull harder' is what makes the song.<br>  ace music though, but anthem should neeeever have happened. fact.|`|4eUwcl9Haa	Generic. That is all.|`|CbsTBaxKaa	They're ****. Metallica wannabees. I hope they break up soon and do the world a favour.
srtoPxN2aa	Yes, I knew that...it's a very old slang term. <br>  Tell an electrician this, or for that matter anyone with a basic understanding of electricity and they'd probably offer a third, very commonly known definition of the term|`|fMfBAgOUaa	AC/DC is overrated.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	WHAT?!<br>  <br>  No, I didn't know that!! Haha!! XD|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Yeah, back in '81 that's how my parents justified their reason for not letting me listen to them. I had to keep spare copies of Highway to Hell and Back in Black just in case they found my main ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dang biggots|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	AC/DC is what??|`|euZRbiA2aa	Yes i know that.Maybe that word is used more in the uk.|`|1jGEeMDYaa	yes, I have known that, like forever, but thanks for sharing|`|1UKr652Uaa	Yeah, I knew that. Unfortunately, the band didn't. They were actually quite frequently mistakenly booked into gay bars in Australia and England before they hit it big!|`|8RkYlaQxaa	Oh my god. I'm so frikin' shocked. :-\ (Not really, I knew)<br>  <br>  2 points<br>  <br>  Mark this question as my 1,000th answer. Hooray|`|AGP2dI6uaa	"Those who swing both ways.  AC/DC's."<br>  Alternating Current/Direct Current.|`|Cppi6kRFaa	Yes and "gay" also mean happy. So?|`|d4fdcfd497acff42297153ae1caa813eaa	is the best rock band ever.|`|N4ORX2fZaa	Wow.

So if a band just stays in the clubs and plays to the same 200 people every night they're ok? But as soon as they make a record that reaches alot more people then just their usual fan base they become sellouts? That's why people join bands. that's why bands make records. To get more people to listen and like their music. Then in turn more people buy their records and they make more money. If you like it who cares if you think they've sold out?|`|qsPEclFpaa	I mean yeah alot of "lame" people are listening to them, but that really doesn't mean anything. They listen to what they want to.

pian616Daa	It's just a label given to the type of music that certain stereotyped teens are associated with, such as Dance/Techno. However, it concerns me that R&B and Hip-Hop is part of 'chav' culture, because these so called labeled people don't even follow the hip hop culture, they follow the trend. Anyway, people have ditched the Helly Hansens and have Gola Bags now, being INDIE is the new thing. Not for me, i'll just carry on being me.

There is no full studio version of Zero Gravity right now.  And that partial piece may just be the demo David and Mike Krompass recorded for Jive in the early fall to try to get the full song on his album (and the same demo that was supposedly being shopped around to other artists when Jive didn't put it on the album).  But yes - I heard David is recording it. But I don't know for what.  I am hoping Jive will do a super-deluxe version of David's album with Save the Day and Zero Gravity added.  I would also like to hear the other song David wrote with Mike Krompass called Fighting for You. Only two of the songs they wrote together made it on the album - A Little Too Not Over You and Somebody Out There (preorder bonus).

BKrqlGz4aa	Virtual tie between ep III & ep VI ... if not for the "Ghost Switch" at the end of ep VI it would be number one but that stupid scene knocks it down to a tie with ep III.<br>  <br>  These are just my personal opinions and you know opinions are like @ssholes ... every one has one but I digress ...<br>  <br>  Ep III rocked from start to finish ... the wild action scenes the lightsabre duels ... it's more than enough to get you to ignore the horrible dialog and stiff acting in places.  The only real problem I had with the movie is that it should have been about 5 hours long if Lucas wanted to make sure everyone actually knew what was going on behind the scenes.  Even as a die-hard fan since I was 8 years old I found myself saying "WTF" several times during the movie.  This is truly one of those movies in which you have to read the novel version of it because it fills in many of the "blanks" that Lucas had to cut out due to time constrictions.  The biggest of these things is the duel between Yoda and Palpatine.  Any time I see someone say that Palpatine won that duel it makes my blood boil because they obviously don't know ... the rest of the story (sorry, couldn't resist putting a Paul Harvey taint to the answer ... Godspeed Mr. Harvey)  Yoda retired from the fight ... if you want to call that losing then fine but it's another of those pesky Certain Point Of View things ... the book tells you why he retired from the fight instead of fighting to the death ... neither of them could actually die since that would have seriously messed up the time line of the story ... the book tells you WHY Yoda walked away from the fight and wonder of wonders ... it actually makes sense ... you don't see that much in the world of Lucas.<br>  <br>  Ep VI was, to me anyways, the perfect end to a great story.  I do have to say that I can't understand why people hate the Ewoks and their role in bringing down the mighty Empire.  Doesn't anyone remember David VS Goliath?  That is what the Ewoks, aside from being all cute, fuzzy and lovable, were meant to show ... how the greatest of Empires can be destroyed by a little rock.  It was the emotion of the characters that drove this movie ... most of the biggest battles in this movie happened inside the minds of the main characters.  In the end it showed that no matter what the odds are ... good will win ... maybe not in the way you want to win but good does win in the end.  Don't get me going on the "Ghost Switch" ... that was just plain wrong from the get go.<br>  <br>  Anyways, that's my two cents worth ...<br>  <br>  May The Force Be With You ...|`|YkseyT7zaa	The original Episode 4|`|656079ce94cfd53c731f9d38d09cd09baa	Obviously, this is going to bring in subjective answers, so there won't really be a single 'right' answer.<br>  <br>  But for my money, the best one is Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.  It is directed by Irvin Kirshner, the best of the 3 directors, and was the best acted out of the six.  The music is progressively better than the previous movie - building on the great quality it had, and constituted the introduction of Darth Vader's theme and Yoda's theme.  It was the best written, with the least amount of awkward "epic" talk and the tightest of the plot lines.<br>  <br>  For me the only two things it had going against it was the production design - being limited since there's little exciting to design for snow and clouds - and Mark Hamill's acting in a single shot - wherein he is reacting to Darth Vader's revelation at the end - his mouth actually crawls up the pole and always bothered me.  Beyond those two blemishes, I find Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back to be the pinnacle of the Star Wars saga.|`|ysbmM3Tcaa	Episode 1397 out of the TV series. and yes there was a TV series.|`|AA10177120	The Empire Strikes Back.

She shouldn't bite the hand that feeds her. She should be thankful for the light that this movie cast on her and fulfill her obligation with her mouth shut. No one will want to work with a non-talented jerk of a person who has a bad attitude. I say let her quit. She will be begging to come back when they see how someone else could be so much  better for the role.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I'm not sure. I hope not. I loved her as Bella. I don't think I would be able to cope with a new one. She was perfect for the role. If she does drop out of the Twilight series, then I think they should just drop the whole thing. Twilight without Rob or Kris will just suck. So what's the point of casting a new Bella and Edward?|`|fKAFNW3Baa	hmmm<br>  check this out<br>  Kristen Stewart says it would be "so easy" for her not to appear in anymore Twilight films.<br>  <br>  The 18-year-old actress - who is due to reprise her role as Bella Swan alongside Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen) in Twilight sequel New Moon - says she'd drop out of the popular movie franchise to send hundreds of teenage girls into a "frenzy".<br>  <br>  She explains, "I've totally had the thought; it would be so easy for me to send so many hundreds of girls into such a frenzy by saying I want no part of any future [Twilight] movies.<br>  <br>  "It took a long time for me to admit that I was too bogged down by the first book, to admit to these girls that I wasn't as... I'm just as obsessed as they are; I read it from an entirely different perspective and had to live it for three months.<br>  <br>  "Yeah, I have thought, many times. "What could I do?"

fSYg06PKaa	I thought it was good.  Here is why:<br>  <br>  Milk opens with archival footage of police raiding gay bars and arresting patrons during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by Dianne Feinstein's November 27, 1978, announcement to the press that Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone have been assassinated. Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days (November 18, 1978) before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk's 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, Scott Smith.<br>  Unsatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley, a working class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist, eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones. Early on, Smith serves as Milk's campaign manager, but his frustration grows with Milk's obsessive devotion to politics, and he leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira, a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, however, Lira cannot tolerate Milk's devotion to political activism, and eventually hangs himself.<br>  After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly, Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in the United States. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative, has a difficult relationship with Milk. He has a growing resentment for Milk, largely due to the attention paid to Milk by the press and his colleagues.<br>  Milk and White forge a complex working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a psychiatric hospital from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978. Sponsored by John Briggs, a conservative state legislator from Orange County, Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools. It is also part of a nationwide conservative movement that starts with the successful campaign headed by Anita Bryant and her organization Save Our Children in Dade County, Florida to repeal a local gay rights ordinance. On November 7, 1978, after working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. The increasingly unstable White is in favor of a supervisor pay raise, but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the Proposition, resigns from the Board. He later changes his mind and asks the city to rescind his decision. Mayor George Moscone denies his request, after having been lobbied by Milk to do so.<br>  On the morning of November 27, 1978, White enters San Francisco City Hall through a basement window in order to conceal a gun from metal detectors. He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for re-appointment. Enraged, White shoots Moscone and then Milk. The film suggests that Milk believed that White might be a closeted gay man.<br>  The film ends with an aerial shot of the candlelight vigil held by thousands for Milk and Moscone throughout the streets of the city.|`|8SqkRIwMaa	Wonderful movie...<br>  <br>  watch it at<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.needmovies.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.needmovies.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  if you haven't seen it yet|`|XGCHYkwFaa	it was a great movie, and a true story|`|XQcPi2Msaa	I didn't see it but I heard that it was really good.|`|sRh0ZyhLaa	ghayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	really stupid another film from Hollywood promoting gay people|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	WORTH seeing, & a beautiful film.

If you're finding it hard to pitch it, try lowering the pitch a little using whatever recording software you're using - that might help you a bit.|`|AA10105565	Are you trying to record an a' capella chorus or a chorus that is accompanied? Recording an a' capella chorus takes several microphones and an acoustically accurate studio. The choir should be set up left to right in the order of bass, barritone, tenor and tenor 2, alto, and soprano 1 and 2, with your strongest voices spred through the group to maintain tonality and pitch. You will need a minimum 24 track board with the ability to level each of the sections so the choir sounds like it would live. There are many more things that can or should be done, but that is a good place to start.|`|3voM7Gfsaa	send a link!|`|3qLIRorjaa	Put the link on then

AXE1ukupaa	As a Capricorn female, I don't like Pisces because they're conniving and often are only out to get you, BUT if you've found a nice guy, which is possible even for a Pisces, try asking him for the homework assignment, or something ambiguous and unassuming like homework or notes. Then thank him with a pretty smile and repeat. Talking to him more will let you know what he's into, and then you can start talking about those things- but never use the same excuse twice. Boys get suspicious and weirded out when you constantly ask for the current assignment or more notes.<br>  <br>  ; ) Good luck.|`|GrbcICzMaa	srry i dont believe in horoscope junk since it doesn't ever work and if you really like each other than try it. to start a conversation talk to him about random junk until he notices that you are staring at him or just stare until he screams.|`|LSqFxEaJaa	Disregard anything you hear about romance and astrology.

7CelNR3Oaa	The Aural Tests at Grade 5 are not too hard-it starts to get a bit more tricky from Grade 6 upwards.<br>  You have 3 sections:-<br>  <br>  1) Sing back a melody (probably 4 bars). At grades 1-3 you would have had to sing 3 short phrases, in the form of an echo. At Grade 5 you get one longer melody played twice. A few tips for this:- try to hear two sections to this melody (2 phrases), maybe in the form of a question and answer. This may not be possible every time, but it might be. This will help you sort out what might seem a long melody in your mind. On the 1st hearing listen very carefully. On the 2nd, hum along quietly. That way you will find out where you know the melody well and where you don't.<br>  <br>  2) Singing the blobs- you have to sing a series of pitches, in your own time, as slowly as you like. They will range from 5 notes above the tonic (key note) to 4 notes below. When these blobs move by step, you should be able to sing quite easily, by going up or down. If there is a gap between one note to the next, take your time and sing very quietly the note or notes inbetween to help you pitch the next real note. Above all take your time. The examiner will not mind. Best to be slow and accurate than rush.<br>  <br>  3) The extrat is worth the most marks. The examiner will ask a few questions about a piece of music. Here is what you need to know:-<br>  <br>  a) forte and piano (loud and soft)<br>  b) crescendo and diminuendo (getting louder and getting softer)<br>  c) legato and staccato (smooth and joined or short and detached)<br>  d) major or minor key (remember that major is generally happy and minor serious and sad)<br>  e) accelerando and rallentando/ritardando (getting faster and slower)<br>  f) words to describe the character of the music. GIve at least 2 words- if not 3. Extend your vocab. Eg. Happy, sad, bold, majestic, thoughtful, jubilant, march-like, regal, reflective, peaceful, agitated etc.<br>  g) style and period. To say whether the piece comes from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic or Modern periods. Very ocaasionally an examiner asks for a possible composer from the period. Baroque music tends to be quite formal and upright(Bach & Handel), Classical is charming, and elegant  (Mozart & Haydn), Romantic is passionate and gushing (Schumann & Brahms) or Modern is very rhythmic and can be dischordant (Bartok or Stavinsky).<br>  <br>  You will then have to clap back a short rhythm for the piece, which the examiner will play twice. And then say whether the music is in 2 or 3 or 4 time.<br>  <br>  In your exam, make sure you are FLUENT and RHYTHMIC when you play- examiners put a lot of emhasis here than any other aspect. But do try to be musical and expressive at the same time...<br>  <br>  Good luck, and by the way, DON'T GIVE UP!!!
bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Why would he care?  he is a doctor its not like it would be a big deal to him, if your dating him you must have a prosthetic foot and it looks normal.  People date the whole person, they want personality, humor that sort of thing your foot isn't going to be a huge issue.
AgBH66nJaa	First of all, I am very sorry to hear about your car accident.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I went out with a Taurus man for nearly six years. They might seem all money, money, money but they are also incredibly generous. Like you said, they think that money is the root of all happiness and they will spend to keep you and see you happy - so it's not as if it's a bad thing! Unfortunately, this does come with the fact that they assume you must be happy because they are buying you things than taking any notice of where the relationship might be failing for example emotional support. <br>  But they are very determined and strong-minded, I'm certain he wouldn't mind about your problem if you told him, it's in his nature to want to help you. He might also see this as a challenge or an opportunity, both of which a Taurus hardly ever turns away from. <br>  It is a pleasure to have a Taurus in your life because they're goal is to make you happy, they're very devoted and strong characters. They have a heart of gold and are hard workers. The only bad thing I can think of about them is like I said, they tend not to admit that there is something wrong straight away and will try to convince themselves or you that there is not a problem.<br>  Telling this man should not be a problem, he will be very understanding and eager to help :)|`|G3lkvGfDaa	I'm sorry to hear about your foot. <br>  <br>  I'll use my Taurus rising to answer this because I have an obsession with money too.  Taurus is known to be the sign of materialism and money.  Thus, it's natural for a Taurus to think like this and I understand him.  Don't worry about tell him about your foot.  Taurus people are very caring and loving because they're a Venus ruled sign.<br>  <br>  I think he wants to be a doctor just for the money maybe.|`|X98qlf2iaa	Same as a cancer man, same as a leo...<br>  They have no real bearing on personality, I'd suggest you either get to know him or just tell him and discover what he's like.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't like it, then he's hardly worth he trouble right?|`|0iAGnjFvaa	taurus men are SUPER materialistic, because they like to feel comfortable and at home, and like you said, they are KNOWN for their MONEY skills... this is because he wants security<br>  <br>  i dont think you need to worry about what he'll think of your foot, although they are materialistic, it's about actual objects, if he loves you, he will look past that<br>  <br>  taurus is ruled by venus, so he's a very affectionate and loving man, the lack of foot will probably mean absolutely nothing to him<br>  <br>  and he's a DOCTOR, im sure he's used to all kinds of injuries and accidents<br>  <br>  dont worry =D|`|n53BNB8taa	Hi some people got cancer disease and some HIV so when you compare yourself to them, you have to feel lucky.<br>  <br>  Taurus is a family loving, music loving and food loving sign and very sensual too.So tell him when you feel comfortable and he will accept you.<br>  Don't feel sad, every one got some problems in their lives.By the way what is your star sign? (pisces, cancer, cap, scorpio, virgo)?<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|bvwYVGJOaa	I'm a fellow sister sign of earth sign and i'll tell you that he will care for you only for you. He aint' gonna care why or how you lost it he will be there for you and as a doctor he cares for people's health and conditions.<br>  <br>  Don't feel sad but be open and direct with him though. It's all your insecurity. Yes i'm a afraid Taurus guys are materlistic and greed for money and i'm dealing with one, lolz! But it's all for the security and stability. You'll appreciate soon enough babez.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! XX

You aren't able to hear a persons tone of voice when they are texting.  It can be difficult to perceive what it is they are trying to say.  If you are feeling a certain way while the person is texting you, your perception of what's being written may be off.  In other words, you may take offense in something that's not actually offensive.  You just read it wrong.  Also, people are more likely (or sometimes less likely) to say things that they don't really mean over a text.  Its easy to be opinionated, rude or hurtful when you aren't actually looking the person in the eye.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure which relationship you are referring to, but yes, its highly likely your relationship will change when you aren't able to verbally communicate on a regular basis.  I can't predict in what way it will change, but it WILL change.|`|zAAeLFLuaa	Yes, with texting Im all like:<br>  <br>  awwdwerfE@!#@$@#$#T#RFER$#R%$#TRFGER#$ ~!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  With talking Im like:<br>  <br>  *crickets*|`|DwI2MV53aa	Yes, there is a difference. It's easier to text someone profane or harmful things because you're not hearing or seeing the real person and you're just talking to your phone sort of|`|nfEdqqsnaa	I usually text people if I don't want to have a full-length conversation, so yeah. It's very different.|`|GJLjNk5Waa	There's obviously a difference.  Texting is less personal, and you don't have to worry about sitting on the phone with a person and making conversation.  Actaully talking to someone allows the other person to hear emotions.  It's much more personal.|`|hbgEUMWJaa	YES becuase texting can get complicated because sometimes people dont know what you realy mean you know..like they can actauully hear your voice and the way you mean something..its better to talk|`|9UM1BIbjaa	texting can be cnofusing because you cnt rly tell the emotion or the way the person is saying something. <br>  but i prefer it.|`|49hXgGjkaa	it will intensify when you start talking.|`|l0KzFSUbaa	yes there is so much more with talking
FOeWqr0qaa	Depends if your bf/gf wants you talking to their friends or family.<br>  <br>  I still talk to my ex boyfriends mother all the time. He doesn't like it anymore but I don't care. I was with him for 5 years and his mother is the most amazing person I've met. Too bad he takes after his father who is the biggest jackass I've ever met.

vYeS5mYnaa	getting a job is a full time job. yes! apply to places that aren't hiring and keep in touch every month or 6 weeks. dont let them forget u! good luck. im in the same boat.|`|LOQMQU8Saa	In a single place, I'd suggest one application. If they have a need and like your profile they will ocntact you back, but sending many applications in will only annoy them and get you the opposite results. Howerver, if you really are interested in the company you can send one application every 3 or 4 months.<br>  Also, you can def send in a spontaneous application even if they aren't posting hiring signs, you never know they could be replacing someine and in need of employees.

According to Star and several anonymous witnesses, Gosselin crashed a college party, got drunk and flirted with women, and left the party with two young women.  A photo of Jon with two young women, taken at a bar, was shown as "proof" of his infidelity; an Internet gossip rag went further, claiming a source told them Jon and Kate are separated and he's living with his mom.  In response, Gosselin stated these rumors are all false, the women he was pictured with were just fans, and he and Kate are fine.|`|D9RNtcU8aa	i found a picture that is supposed to be jon with two women, but it is definately just someone that looks like him.<br>  <br>  so i would say no, even though all the magazines are saying he is.|`|qe9BeZogaa	<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/32331857.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/ohnothe...</a>

lGByR3lcaa	Hmm. As a working stripper, I don't know how to answer this one. It's a job. It's a fun job, but it's still a job. I suppose my stripper persona does like to show off, but it's within the limits of the club. Once outside, I'm just like anyone else. We're more comfortable with our bodies, and we know how to present it better(under black light anyway) than normal women, maybe, but that doesn't mean we like to show off.|`|0p9wHjSWaa	It seems most of them have an air about themselves, thinking they are the "cats meow", so I doubt it bothers them that much.

Gray-Man<br>  <br>  And the list can go on. But I'm going to stop. Most of these anime are not like Death Note so don't expect anything like that.

I love Death Note but there are some I like alot more. Its not the most popular but its very good. Some anime that I think are better are:<br>  <br>  Naruto-i like the story line and characters alot more.<br>  Bleach-same reason as Naruto<br>  Fruits Basket-awsome story line and the characters are so relatable..i personally cant relate to anyone that well in DN<br>  Gravitation-so fun to watch. DN is too but sometimes I had to take brakes from it cus it got really sad like when L died cus he was my fav :'(<br>  Eureka Seven (maybe..)<br>  Chobits (if im in a mood to laugh lol)<br>  <br>  I dont really think I have any other anime I like better that DN right now.

ZhCJaXINaa	I totally believe he has the right to change his mind...HOWEVER, I think  shady things were taking place behind the scenes. There is NO WAY on earth you can go from proposing to someone, to wanting to break it off, without even trying to work it out, in a month in a half.<br>  <br>  I think Molly and Jason had probably been talking the whole time between the finale & the 1st After the Finale Rose Ceremony - and thats when he decided he liked Molly more - because he was forming a bond with her as well. Melissa probably picked up on the fact he was creeping, and therefore was distant and cold....<br>  She alluded to it, when she said something like "There is something you have yet to admit and apologize for". She also laughed off his "no" when she asked if he had been talking to Molly. Molly is a HORRIBLE actress too!! Her "surprised" act was completely transparent - and the last piece of evidence I needed to confirm my "shady business" scenario.<br>  <br>  Yes, Jason totally had a right to change his heart, but is he is not as innocent as he acts. Hes the worst kind of bad guy - hes a bad guy that thinks hes good.<br>  1- if you arent 100% sure, then you dont propose to someone!<br>  2- if you are 100% sure, you dont give up after a month and a half.<br>  3- when you call off your engagement, you dont do it on national television<br>  <br>  Molly is scum & I believe she was slutting it up via phone conversations & e-mails trying to get Jason back, and Jason fell for it. They deserve each other. I just hope Molly knows, that if he ever proposes to her, it will be his 4th proposal, and his 3rd in like a year. ....what a catch!

Having gay relationships does.
zFE1MVqPaa	Websites like <a href="http://www.tlareleasing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tlareleasing.com/</a> have gay Asian movies for sale on DVD, subbed in English. Saying that, I definitely think someone has ripped the movie from the DVD and placed it on the internet somewhere. <br>  <br>  Your best bet would be looking through torrent searches, where you would be able to find movies/dramas of all sorts. Download torrents with this software: <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bittorrent.com/</a><br>  <br>   If you're looking for a drama, <a href="http://www.d-addicts.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.d-addicts.com</a> has all Asian dramas, but I don't believe there's homosexuality in them. There may be homosexual characters however. Maybe you could request help in their forums, but remember that Bokura no Ai no kanade is a gay movie, not a drama, and I think that's what you're looking for specifically. <br>  <br>  Good luck (and notify me if you get any luck, I'm interested as well.)

However; it sure is hard to turn of the PC and the TV. ?|`|lfamfJhUaa	its really not the electric companies. at least thats my belief. i honestly think that its the gas. if the pres. from da hood would put a cap on the price it would make thing a bit more breatheable. if the companies overseas kept raising their prices it would allow us to use our own resources. we have begun to rely on countries we cant even trust. anyways do you even realize how many gas alternatives we actually have? gas just so happens to be the most expensive and the biggest money maker.|`|BJu1GAs8aa	Too Right, I put off a gas bill for 3 weeks,went to pay it this morning and recieved the electric bill on my return. ￡480.00 total. errrrrr.|`|z8jYprWkaa	Very nearly amusing<br>  <br>  but not quite|`|Ua1OiWmbaa	I should think so yes, bright idea!|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	I don't understand the question.|`|0ymlYQvnaa	heck yeshh:]|`|vFLnPasAaa	yeah|`|L1DUcTtSaa	What?
wLe7nBLGaa	The twins are ugly!!! bridget is my fav!!! but hef will be hef...out with the old in with the new. But your right they can't take KBH place|`|32bc5fa3ec98f44addcaee08016e9b86aa	I heard about that. I never really watch the show, but the commercials for it are interesting. But I did wonder who was going to replace them.|`|rNmekxLcaa	That show sucks. I can't believe people watch that trash.|`|03fiqGJwaa	i smell bile|`|k7b2CluKaa	The show won't be the same without Holly, Bridget and Kendra, but I might watch the first of the new season to see how the twins and Crystal are.  I'm thinking it's not going to be as good but I have to give it a chance.|`|NWuFyKYcaa	I love the girls next door. I won't watch the new ones.... I don't care for them. They can't replace the original girls.|`|AA10545653	I am!!  Cmon, theres still gonna be smokin hot babes and besides those other ho's were getting lame anyways..need some fresh meat in there!!!|`|PmGeeUheaa	Why is Hef getting new girlfriends?  I thought that he like the old ones.  :(<br>  <br>  ~~|`|5cbILl1caa	nope<br>  <br>  Kendra is slamming|`|VPi7yl3saa	i know!! im so mad he is going out with new girls .. i loved KBH :D|`|AA11510033	I will wait until it come out on DVD like I do know|`|6CAsx3jaaa	i definitely will. they will still have the originals on there . but i liked seeing the mansion and playmates the most. all of the girls were really pretty but i dont think i would have wanted to date any of them. kendra was too adhd, holly was too high maintenance i thought bridget was the coolest of them but im not a dog person. ive got great admiration for hefner he has done so much good and in so many areas. i think the new girls look more normal and seem cooler
bribxhsdaa	That Plies one where he says "A PLIES IS A TOOL YA DIG, YA USE IT TO PUT A SQUEEZE ON THINGS" - <a href="http://mobstaz.com/forum/hip-hop-spot/85000-11-12-08-vibe-interview-plies-december-2008-issue.html" rel="nofollow">http://mobstaz.com/forum/hip-hop-spot/85...</a><br>  <br>  Or the Keith Murray one where he says "Word to mother" like 400 times.|`|tmdFdn3Taa	DEFINATELY the celebrity all-star game interviews;<br>  <br>  snoop is like "HEY LIL KIDS." outta no where in the middle of his interview hahha.<br>  <br>  and the anchor is says 'who do we have over here?' to chris turk (from scrubs) and he trys michael jordan and then trys david duchovney.<br>  hahhha.<br>  <br>  i used to love this video.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPRV93tpwzQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPRV93tpw...</a>
qkyzbkHdaa	He could be referring to burning bridges as in friendships...like if someone was to do something really horrible to you you could burn that "friendship bridge" with them cutting off all communication with them and having nothing to do with them anymore.|`|BGIxDWkZaa	It means to do away with something in your life. Like a friend, or a job, or any other pesky thing that may trouble you. You may wish to revisit that someday. If the "bridge is burnt" how can you get back to it. It's a metaphor.|`|MUuKSFgvaa	Hmm.  I'm never heard of that lol.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227073312AA4ChMN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|BKr3y30maa	He means ruining friendships or relationships that can't be reversed.  Or cutting all ties with something or someone.  Kind of like, throwing something out the window.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	It means that you make someone who may help you in the future not want anything more to do with you.|`|HF1TfsnTaa	It means don't make enimies with anyone you may need that person for something in the future.|`|a667205402b2d65fe82c6c60e1f5b18faa	Getting rid of friendships|`|Mp0MTuvDaa	making enemies<br>  then go looking for them for help|`|b4ed84ea4c76a500f5bae98276bbbf46aa	He doesn't believe in started anything that would make someone upset/angry/sever ties with someone....gotta know the exact content but you really don't want to "add fuel"|`|AORcLwTNaa	google it|`|LLeQyWGcaa	no turning back. you can't go back to the paths you took to get to this point in your life because the paths are broken and you can't go down them anymore. you must move forward.|`|DvjX2DFKaa	to "Burn your bridges" is to leave no alternative to return. Say, your leaving a job, you tell the boss he's a "dirty rotten scoundrel" and if you ever need your job back it's impossible because of what you said.<br>  In other words, your actions or words make it impossible to return.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, if you tell him what a pleasure he was to work for, but you need to widen your horizons, then he will welcome you back if your new job turns sour.|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Means not to lose opportunities because your too good for them... Like when I quit my restaurant job, to get another job...I put my two weeks notice in and served it instead of just quitting...so "just in case" I had to go back they would hire me back because I was a good worker.  That's not burning your bridges....|`|T7qgrOJzaa	It means don't make enemies out of friends, etc.|`|pV6K2mm5aa	making enemies...then needing those people at a later date.

So one month after i've sat through the same 2 episodes in a day, they're recycled and shown again.<br>  <br>  This is why I have to have extended cable.  Basic cable channels just upsets me.<br>  <br>  MTV used to be great, then they turned into all shows *vaguely* about music.<br>  VH1 used to be my salvage from the crap that was MTV and then BAM, VH1 turned into a bunch of crappy shows *vaguely* about music.|`|kJmyOIBjaa	yeah, i've thought that about MTV for as long as I can remeber and have just recently about cartoon network.

Workers want to be paid all this money for very little work.  The prices of cars are ridiculous, but what's the company going to do.

ivqfhzHXaa	Night Shift Nurses opens with Dr. Ryuji Hirasaka, a gynecologist, looking back on an event feature everyday objects and human wastes. In most cases, it is not until the second or third sexual encounter that the nurses are 'transformed' and succumb to whatever Hirasaka subjects them to. It is worth noting that, when compared with other hentai productions, Night Shift Nurses is somewhat different - that is, it is also a psychological drama. While Ryuji is indeed despicable, his 'victims' are unable to resist him and, later on, begin to visibly crave for his so-called experiments (aka. his infamous sexual plays).

M1ymLE9Paa	She is beyond annoying.  I think the show would be better w/o her.  She needs to get a grip...seriously.  Why is she pining away for a man whose cheated on her and married to someone else?  It's time to move on already, and for her to stop having temper tantrums all the time b/c she didn't get what she wanted.  She's ridiculous.  And if she wants to tell the secret, then she should tell it already.  It's annoying the way she keeps going on about it, but doesn't do anything about it.|`|msUIsv8maa	yes she needs to move on sonny has made his Choice i thought she would have more pride and self respect than that.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	I am waiting for the day when she gets hers; until then, I will continue hating to watch her.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I know!

I was like "Well why the hell didn't you call the office, or go straight to the office after you got out of the hospital instead of snooping around Sonny's house if you were so worried about your magazine.?" Yeah, I totally agree with you there.
WjuSuKjoaa	I also heard that, and totally agree with you, YUCK!  Can't he find somebody, not his brother's wife, to hook up with?  I'm so tired of the show not having any real supercouples...

Wonder what story is coming now..|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I wonder, do writers on soaps just drop names in a hat and draw out 2 at random to make couples? Are there ever happy marriages or people who stay together?<br>  <br>  Phyllis and Nick are obviously not going well, and I don't know as wacky as Sharon as come if Nick and Sharon will be together, but anything goes.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	Yes I had heard that, he was chasing after her and flirting with her when had first arrived in Genoa City, and Nick became jealous and threatened, but looks like Adam will finally get her into bed this time. LOL|`|msUIsv8maa	Its Geneo City where everybody gets Screwed lol|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Yeah right, just like how the spoilers said that Brad was supposed to be shot by Phyllis at the cabin with a bullet that was supposed to be for sharon and Phyllis was supposed to go to jail paving the road for a Nick and Sharon reunion....NOT!|`|AA11111233	I read off a soap opera message board that Chris Engen, Adam's portrayer has speculated that this is not true, and that it's supposedly not going to happen.  This is all part of the giant push by Shickies to get Nick and Sharon back together. He said this was something that has been going through the minds of Shick fans (and IMO, something they made up completely, just to piss Phyllis/Phick fans off.)  But I believe CE here, and I strongly doubt that Phyllis is the type to resort to "revenge sex" when things don't go her way, unlike Sharon.

It is only on TV about once a week and was the highest grossing movie of all time (during it's time) and is famously known as the first "summer blockbuster" that has set the trend for movie releases ever since.<br>  <br>  What ever happened to that unknown filmmaker Steven something who made Jaws?

o0CrpEyfaa	Not sure what to think.  Leah does have a small part in New Moon but a bigger one in Eclipse.  Maybe they want to see how it will play out.  Either way, i cant wait till November  :)|`|Sa7IZrJhaa	That really sucks cause I think Leah is just awsome and should be in there and uh later she plays a strong role for the last book and if they don't have her then then there may not be any more movies after new moon|`|b4JMuacSaa	I don't know. They can't do that, then the movie would be messed up. But I don't really care as long as Dakota Fanning plays Jane. :)|`|BHpELpEqaa	well i understand why she's not in it. because she really isn't in new moon that much so why out her in the movie for only like a scene or two and have her actress be a surprise in the third!|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	What do I think?

bgpQt0rFaa	I wouldn't worry about much people say, its how he makes you feel when you sad or when your suppose to be the only star in the room. But I'm sure you guys will find your happiness or maybe you already have, who im i to judged. I do know a couple that were gemini and cancer and they loved each other at the wrong time, an i imagine that had to hurt alot. But on the other hand those two created a son together and he now is with a cancer. An from how good i know him he's lost without her, he mentions alot about her being her since of security(like a mothers love, hug or kiss) but what i do notice is that there is alot of things you both will have to give up for love. But remember real love has no cost, you'll do anything for it or each other. I would just say give it a chance, an if it don't work at least you know you tried. Follow your heart an everything else will follow you.|`|cuvBHGyraa	Cancer sign compatibility with Gemini<br>  Cancer and Gemini? You'd better not, stars say... <br>  <br>  A domestic Cancer, and a Gemini who can't live without a phone, without paying visits to friends and relatives. It's hard to make a union of this kind work! What you, dear Cancer, are looking for - peace, safety and a comfortable home - is exactly what scares a Gemini, consciously or not: to him/her, change and the place where it happens are the most important things it is worth living for! Not to mention Cancer's traditional moods, which Gemini can't stand... <br>  <br>  Moreover, Gemini moves around so much and is so active, that (s)he doesn't have much time to spend at home, and this is exactly the place you enjoy the most. <br>  <br>  However, it also depends on what you are looking for. The typical Cancer looks for peace and stability. But if you are a Cancer that is keen on adventure, fun and an exciting life, then you have found your partner! Weird things, new ideas? Gemini has them all! (S)He's the adolescent of the zodiac, isn't (s)he? Nevertheless, a Cancer won't put up with it for long and one day you'll come to the conclusion that all Twins are a button short (that's not quite true, they are just different from the Crabs...). <br>  <br>  However, understanding as you are, you might tolerate his/her crazy attitude for a while, especially because your Gemini can be very mature sometimes, due to his/her dual nature (there are two people in this sign and almost always the native has a double personality). Anyway, at one point, you'll come to the conclusion that you want to be closer to Earth than this Air sign.|`|2ydtpZ7oaa	These two have an intense physical attraction that often leads to marriage and the breeding of children. <br>   The key is for the Cancer to understand the Gemini need for lots of friends and mental stimulation outside the relationship. <br>  The Gemini can also seem quite callous to the Cancer who is much more sensitive and emotional. Jealousy can be a problem if the Gemini does not learn to constantly tiptoe around the Cancer's insecurities!|`|OCzss4xJaa	If you love him and he loves you and this continues, there's nothing to worry about zodiac compatibility. <br>  <br>  Every relationship is hard, if they were not, you wouldn't put much value in them, would you? :)<br>  <br>  There have been many compatible relationships gone bad and many incompatible relationships that have been brilliantly successful. It all depends on what you want.<br>  <br>  You want to be with him forever and he feels the same, forget astrological compatibility.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	My father was Cancer, my mother is Gemini.  Their marriage lasted 20 something years.  He died young, age 42, but they did get a divorce a few years before he died.  It was not a good marriage but I don't think it has anything to do with astrology :P  More importantly is who is the dominant one in your relationship, who is submissive?  Who is the leader, who is the follower?  Are you two happy with your roles?  In my parents' marriage, they both wanted to be the leader.  He was a year younger than her, just like the two of you.  Oh! and by the way, no marriage is easy, it takes a lot of work no matter who you marry.|`|3VKiFmMJaa	Just wait and see what happens. I recommend reading who u each of u is most compatible with, and if u don't feel you're fulfilling each other's needs then call it quits. But don't read too much into astrology b/c then it could become a self fulfilling prophecy.|`|8lwGjvQpaa	one thing i noticed with girls if they dont like a guy thell take anything as a bad sign especially horoscopes|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	astrological DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING<br>  <br>  stop looking at horoscopes it means nothing|`|aaiPjDg0aa	Well if you are really into horoscopes (like me) I would take it into consideration, but just that reason doesn't have to decide your future.|`|R84KyAF2aa	dont listen to this stuff u have the power to change ur life so just ignor this and life ur life nothing will go wronge unless u do something wrong so dont worry|`|695d21ebfb6cd5df0ea25fe623092724aa	I'm Gemini and my best pal is Cancer.<br>  <br>  We get on very well and have a lot of laughs.<br>  <br>  You're fine|`|4VNFsmanaa	Get a birth chart for both of you, then have an astrologer compare them. You too might have other compatible personal planets and aspects. I'm a Gemini and I always fall for Cancers, so it can be very helpful if your feeling doubtful about the compatibility.|`|QZzQdh43aa	yes, you are<br>  <br>  This is not a very good love match for you. You may be strongly drawn to a Gemini boy’s bubbly personality and plentiful charm. However, you are opposites in nature. You are emotional and your feelings run very deep. On the other hand, he takes an intellectual approach to life that will seem cold and distanced to you. Any sparks between you in the physical department will wear off pretty quickly once the difference in your personalities sets in. An unlikely match for love. ( Source: Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide ) <br>  <br>  Often, things can be wonderful and exciting between Cancer girl and Gemini guy.  The downside of this astro-combo is that you're both prone to fits of depression and feeling a bit down in the dumps, so it's important to be a source of comfort (and Ben and Jerry's) for each other, rather than part of the problem.|`|ZtnXNbaEaa	here i go giving you some positive points about a gemini and cancer relationship... cancers are the only signs which can make a gemini learn what committment is all about... andgemini's are the only sign which can make a cancer with hell lotta depth can make it light hearted and practical... what this astrology says? is ofcourse true but then two persons compatibility can be better know by looking into each others birth cahrts and the synastry... thats how it is calculated... dont fall in this misconception of jus going with the sun.. i've seen a cancer(my friend) and a gemini going on so well.shez very sentimental but she never shows it to her gemini bf who thinks sentiments are meaningless but then hez the most fickle one... and his indecisivenss is helped by the cancer... and he's the gemini who never wanted to be in a relationship finally ended up with her happily... people say gemini dont wanna get tied down but in any moment of life everyone had to look for a mate.. all you need is understanding and love for eachother... and if you both are married then its not really a big deal... you have acheived tying down the most fickle minded people ever... that must be your great acheivement|`|NRhrO833aa	Im a Cancer and my Sister is a Gemini. She gets on my nerves SOOO MUCH, I cant stand her but....I feel a strange sense of gratitude ever time she does. I love her and will love her forever. We always share our Ideas [she's more intellectual than I, but I can sense feelings better]. We always do puzzles together and stuff. There is no such thing as doom for opposite signs!|`|WPd4MYt6aa	First of all, obviously you must pretty compatible since you're married. Second of all, astrology isn't real!

shKc7lZcaa	I have a strange feeling that Carter may die...I mean, come on...alot of the old cast is showing back up...What other reason would there be?  Ya know?  Neela has to end up with Ray, it would be very disappointing if she didn't.  Tony and Sam - definitely.  They are already setting it up a little.  I think Banfield will get her baby somehow.  Whether through adoption or a miraculous conception or something.  It's definitely time for ER to say goodbye, but I have to say that I'm quite sad.  My Thursday nights will never be the same again :(|`|A03NJA26aa	I really hope Carter gets his kidney though I have a feeling he will die, he is like the patriarch of that show so it would only be typical writer/producer idea if they killed him. Sam and Tony should be together, Ray need to be with Neela, Dr. banfield and her husband should get a child some how and the old cast should reunite in one big episode. way back last season when I heard this year would be their last I thought maybe for the finale, the hospital would have to be imploded since it is an old building and the docs and nurses watch it fall. it would be bittersweet, no one would die, just the building.

hJP9y6kjaa	If 320/48khz doesn't satisfy you, then you're doing something wrong.<br>  <br>  Use a better ripper in the future - CDex is a great program that uses the Lame mp3 codec, it is the best quality codec out there. So many people rip with Windows Media Player or some crappy pos program like that, and that is one reason why even files that should sound good don't. You've got to use a decent quality program for it to sound good.<br>  <br>  What are you listening on? Because if its earbuds, then you're deluding yourself - nothing will sound that good over earbuds, even CD quality. If you're listening on a nice high-end sound system, well duh, a good system reveals the flaws in a poorly encoded/ripped song... and the limitations of a compressed file will stick out. If that's the case, then get a tube preamp, it will help greatly.... but even then, with a system like that even CD quality won't probably sound good enough for you.... you may just have to find SACD albums....<br>  <br>  WAV files have the highest quality, because they aren't compressed. FLAC and OGG are next in line. 320 kbps mp3 is the highest quality of mp3 you can get. I wouldn't use WMA or AAC at all, personally.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to how well its ripped, though. If the CD player or CD is glitchy, if the computer isn't optimized for ripping, if the computer is being used for other stuff while ripping/encoding, etc it's going to lower the quality.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I'm not crazy with the audio quality of lossy files, either. You can always just rip WAV files, which are CD quality, but the downside is that the files are huge, and you can't tag them in most media players (in other words, you can't add cover art or alter artist/title info).<br>  <br>  To try to save space, you can try a lossless format, like FLAC or WMA Lossless. None of the information gets thrown out, but the files are roughly 60% the size of a WAV (in my experience, anyway).<br>  <br>  Another option is to try a variable bitrate. Then you can still use a lossy format and save some disk space, but the bitrate adjusts as needed throughout the song, in order to preserve as much of the sound quality as possible.
HZxX9ke8aa	those planets good at those houses but that's not enough. one might have the same thing but rest of the planets and what aspects they are casting to those planets very important.<br>  <br>  if i put saturn in a way to make an opposition with your sun, then moon to make a sqaure with your venus etc... many things will change.<br>  <br>  edit: hum, basically any square or opposition is bad. square is kind of reversible if you work on them but you have to change "yourself" to deal with oppositions, as far as i have experienced. <br>  <br>  like if mercury on a fixed sign and making a conjuction or good aspect with, say, your mars, you will have a sharp and furious mind, you will be very determined, ambitious and probably very tricky when it comes to how to deal with your opponents. cause mars is the god of war and mercury is mentality. you will be something like odysseus, you know how he deal with sirens and stuff, right?<br>  <br>  but if the same mercury in the fixed sign making an opposition with your naptune, there'll be a fight between those, neptune's muse and dreams will spoil mercury's sharp mind and mercury's quick wits and rationality will undermine neptune's artistic talents etc...<br>  <br>  i've tried to explain how it works instead of listing aspects cause this is easier both for me and you.

OSK0tQPSaa	A lot of people did not understand the humor of it and could not grasp the concept of the grindhouse film<br>  <br>  Also, it did not know if it wasnted to be humor or "serious"|`|hQ95u9OLaa	None of the above. His films are usually quite violent. His films all pay a sort of homage to exploitation films of one kind or other. Planet Terror was what it was supposed to be: a dopey goof on Zombie pictures.<br>  <br>  Sometimes movies just don't make it. There's no good reason. And I think you realize this but just because it was a financial failure doesn't mean it was an artistic failure. <br>  <br>  Tarantino's films are supposed to be based on heroes and plots of movies that he grew up watching. But nobody has such a clear idea of what to do with the camera, or such a sure editing hand. Deathproof was supposed to be a dumb exploitation flick but it's so obviously so much more. When the first three girls see the DJ's picture and the car is traveling and then it just disappears is startling but foreshadows what's going to happen to them. That song playing in their car while they are racing to their death; the way it shows the shot tearing up each girl individually. Yes it's violent but it puts the viewer on their side and makes him or her want to see Kurt Russell get his. And it makes one really afraid of him. That scene where the camera is going around the table while the next three girls are talking and laughing. You see Kurt Russell in one shot but not in the next. It's all been done in one take but Kurt has missed some valuable information and that is that one of the stunt ladies always "brings a gun to a knife fight!"<br>  <br>  The car chase is utterly fantastic. Their revenge on Kurt is a blast too. It's just great movie.|`|b25065caf34b81dfca3b01c2d8cc99aaaa	C - cause Planet Terror sucked!! Death Proof is a great movie! All my friends and family never heard of it, and when I tell them to watch it, they're like dam that's a bad a*s movie!!

P8gGMlbIaa	Yes, they are both still anime series.<br>  Any one that says otherwise is incorrect.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Yes Pokemon and Digimon are both Anime series.|`|X45rxI7gaa	can you please post links to them?<br>  <br>  They're Japanese and have manga visuals, so that makes them anime too. That is a huge disrespect even if you don't like Pokemon, because that was the show that started the popularity of anime. There were anime that were popular before Pokemon, but this show caught everyone's attention to what they call 'Japanese Cartoons' because it reflected how different they were from regular American animation. The problem is that the dub was overly Americanized especially since it came out at a time when we weren't aware of the changes between American dubbed anime and the original Japanese versions.|`|f456a981d29b822c5b34d993104fa366aa	Technically yes it is.<br>  <br>  But there are many different type of anime, such as shonen-ai, hentai, and a whole bunch of others.<br>  <br>  Pokemon would be considered a kid anime, or meant towards younger children.Such as Fruits Basket is a shoujou, meant for girls from 10-18. I'm not sure what the name is for the kids one though.<br>  <br>  But yes, Pokemon is in anime. It was also made in Japan first, so big hint there.<br>  <br>  ~AnimeLover101|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I say yes they are. especially with the fan service (see the uncut version of "Beauty and the beach)
