If this guy is going to crash there for an extended period, he needs to be added to the lease, and you guys need to start splitting rent 3 ways.  If they were to share a bedroom and you have the bigger bedroom, I can see you paying a bit more.  As it stands, it seems your roommate is making out pretty nicely here!!!  How would he feel if you let someone come in and sleep on the floor on a blow up mattress or sleeping bag? LOL<br>  <br>  Also, this guy who is couch surfing is using electricity, water, cable tv and whatever other utilities, that YOU are paying for!|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Half of the rent that goes to the roommate is technically yours!

AA11988627	The answers to that one are very subjective, but there are two ways for you to find out for yourself whether or not it’s a fit for you. The first is called an Informational Interview. It’s a 20 minute (more or less) interview you do with someone who is doing what you’re thinking about doing for a living.  Drop me an email and I’ll send you a basic questionnaire form and tell you how to tweak it to your liking. The second way is to Job Shadow. Just like the name implies, you follow the person who is doing what you think you’d like to do for a living around for anywhere from two hours to an entire business day. I think three hours is the ideal amount of time, but that’s just me. After you do these two things, if you still think being a Pastry Chef is your cup of tea, go for it! And remember: even if you decide years down the road that you want to change again, you still will have picked up valuable transferable skills you’ll be able to use for other careers.<br>  Smooth Sailing!<br>  Rita|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Pros:<br>  1) Probably would love what you do<br>  2) Get to be creative and expressive in your work<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  1) Very low wages...starting pay is about $8 per hour<br>  2) Very early mornings.

PxoKseAiaa	Yes.<br>  Why wouldn't the appraiser need to be paid?<br>  His hours of work are not because he just *enjoys* it so much.  LOL|`|AA11966821	No mortgage can be approved without first obtaining a current appraisal performed by a licensed independent appraiser.  You must pay for the appraisal whether you are approved for the mortgage or not.  You must pay for the appraisal whether you proceed to closing or not.  This is not just "normal" or "typical," it is standard procedure in all mortgage application processes.|`|FQRjfbW6aa	Yes.  If you back out of the deal after the appraisal is done, he still needs to get paid for his work.
aDKFWaXfaa	I am a real estate agent in Australia with my own independent office.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what courses are like through franchises, however, here, the courses with regular real estate schools are very good.  <br>  <br>  When you are looking to find an agency to work for, consider the following:<br>  <br>  - do they regularly pay for training for their employees?  what kind of training and how frequently?<br>  - does management get regular training and upgrade their knowledge on changes in legislation etc (here we have special annual education to attend to stay in the know)<br>  - what internal systems and procedures do they have that will assist people who are just starting out?  for example, a good computer software and training resources in the office for when you get stuck on something.<br>  - is there someone more experienced in the office that can mentor you?<br>  <br>  I believe that a franchise is not necessarily the best, often all the training that they attend is in house, and they are not open to external training providers (which can be very beneficial).  <br>  <br>  You need to look at the individual operator of the office to decide if it will be a good environment to start your career or not.|`|18c8M1dcaa	You can take the courses through a state-approved online/correspondence course. In California, it was about $150 or so for the basic courses to pass DRE exam. If you are good studying on your own, this is a great way to get through it fast. If you're better in a classroom environment where you can ask questions, then pursue that option. <br>  <br>  I can't recommend a particular company to hang your license with. You'll want to research the desk fees, commission splits, what type of new agent training they have available, transaction assistance, etc. There are a lot of not-busy licensed agents right now, so you may be best served finding a small company that will help train you vs. a  big name brokerage where you have to pay high fees and no one will speak to you.|`|x1AS5MbMaa	Hi Ryan :-)<br>  <br>  Yes, the larger franchises do offer in-house training.  I belong to an ERA Franchise (owned by Realogy who also owns C-21 and Coldwell Banker).  I've found the online courses they offer to be excellent as well as convenient since you can do them in the comfort of your own home.  Some are webinar formats which are also nice because you have an opportunity to answer questions.<br>  <br>  As far as getting your license...I would stay with an Independent Program for your Principles...recommend Anthony's or Allied for that.  You don't want to contractually obligate yourself to a franchise for your initial schooling.<br>  <br>  The best way to find a good office is to talk to the local agents.  It is really important to find an office that isn't too large and with a broker that is very informed and involved in the day-to-day business.  Find an agent who LOVES their office and their broker.  How active are they in their community?  Are they up-to-speed on the newest technologies available?  <br>  <br>  It is more important for you to find a place where you feel supported, and comfortable but challenged.  Take your time so you don't office hop.  Commission split is not the most important so don't be tempted by 90% commission splits because 90% of the time you will have NO support from your broker.  Most beginners start out in the 50-60% range and work up to 70-75% as they gain experience.<br>  <br>  You may want to look into a good coaching program such as Mike Ferry or Tim & Julie Harris.  Both are excellent.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!  This is not a seller's market...not a buyer's market....it is a Realtor's market!|`|94b7e793843de25662bafcbbffb838efaa	Truly I would get do what feels best, you don't have to take a course from the company, I did a home study and class room, I am do to take my test on march 4th. :)

AA11988627	First, Congratulations on getting the interview!!! Rule one: just be you, the best side of you, that is. The number one question asked at a job interview is: Tell me about yourself. Make your answer to the question relevant to the job you’re interviewing for. I don’t know what “buckle” is, but let’s assume it’s a clothing store. Some of your answers might include: “I enjoy people, I like to suggest accessories to go with outfits, I hate to be late for appointments.” Do you see where I’m going with this? Answer the questions so that your best light shines for the employer. Another question an employer might ask would be “What are your weak points?” YIKES! That one can be a royal pain if not handled properly! Here’s my weak point: I hate being late and will often show up to whatever event I’m going to at least fifteen minutes early. That’s a weak point that doesn’t make me look like a jerk, but rather a responsible person…not so bad. What weak point do you have that would make you look good?<br>  Whatever the questions, keep your answers brief and to the point. Dress as a person might that is going to church: clean, no logo’s, no holes, just well-groomed. Don’t ask about vacation time or money. In fact, there’s an old adage regarding the discussion of money at a job interview: He who speaks money first loses. Lastly, at the end of the interview, let them know you want the job and follow-up with a brief, handwritten thank you note.<br>  Good luck!!!<br>  Rita Deo Barber|`|DPajzalfaa	1- Dress professionally. Nice shirt, slacks, and nice shoes<br>  2- Be polite. Don't act like you know everything because you don't. Don't chew gum or smell like smoke. <br>  3- Answer their questions completely. If you don't know the answer to something, don't be afraid to say so. It takes maturity to admit you don't know something.<br>  4-BE EARLY. 5-10 minutes early. Shake their hand firmly but don't give a death grip! <br>  <br>  Other than that- be yourself! They know you will be nervous. Just look them in the eye, be polite and answer the questions as best you can! <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

DBvjwPTcaa	I use paypal and eBay with my bank account for years without problem. Read paypal instructions carefully (I know there is a lot to read).<br>  <br>  Have good habits. You need to do this on your computer....<br>  <br>  1. Have a good Antivirus and Antispyware software like Norton, Bit defender or MacAfee. Keep it operational in the background. Set the automatic updates too.<br>  <br>  2. Clear your computer cache (disk cleanup) and check on all boxes or if you are using Internet Explorer, clear your browsing history, cookies and temporary files. You can do this by right click button on your mouse while placing your pointer on the internet explorer icon, click on properties, and click on those I had mentioned.<br>  Do this every time after logging out of your paypal and eBay. If someone else has used your computer, do this before you login into your account.<br>  <br>  3. Don't login at cafe, Mc Donald’s etc. using unsecured logon. Don't use anyone else’s computer to login if you are unsure of their security.<br>  <br>  "About selling jewelry on the internet?" Cut and paste this sentence without the inverted comas into Google or Yahoo Search. You might find some examples.<br>  <br>  You can do a search on eBay e. g. "costume jewelry" and click on some advertised too. I have a habit of cutting and pasting other people adverts, sale terms on to Microsoft word, edit it as much as possible (copyright issues), attach my photos. Ah yes...place my copyright terms (which is also cut and paste). Setup a new eBay sale, cut and paste that on eBay panel set your price etc. and you are ready to go.<br>  <br>  You might want do research before jumping in too. Search on eBay the item you wish to sell. See what others are selling, if there any active bidding?, Check sellers sales history. Examine the item sold, type, color, material, texture design, price, bid start price, shipping cost, etc. Make a record of these if they sell. (These adverts are good to copy, paste and edit). By doing these, you may increase your sales ROI and reduce your shipping cost.<br>  <br>  Learn from others, take down notes and be organized too.<br>  <br>  To your success and Good Luck!|`|6DJLblHbaa	its safe
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Sounds like you need to invest in equipment of some sort that could make you money by performing work for people.  <br>  <br>  Anyone in your neighborhood need things done?  Is there a house that needs painting?  Lawns that need mowing?  Gardens need trimming?  <br>  <br>  For the painting example, let's say you can convince a neighbor to let you paint the house.   You can buy whatever equipment he doesn't have for you to use on the next paint job for someone else.<br>  <br>  You could buy an electric trimmer to trim bushes and hedges for neighbors.<br>  You've obviously got a computer and some web access.  You could make money by selling stuff on ebay.  <br>  <br>  You could go to flea markets and pick up stuff on the cheap and re-sell on eBay.  A good type of item is old video game systems.  If you can find some that work, they sell for pretty good money on ebay.  I'm talking like Nintendo NES, Atari 2600's, and even earlier.  You might find someone unloading their old collections for $20 because they don't know what they have, and sell them for $50 or more on ebay.<br>  <br>  Another example, every now and then a store near you might run a fantastic sale on something.  Recently a store ran a sale on Quickbooks Pro 2009 for $99, and that normally retails for $199.   You could buy one, turn it around and re-sell it on ebay as Brand New in Box for maybe $130 or $140.|`|wvhoS7WDaa	cash is king<br>  if you have a 100k house you buy with cash and rent it out for 1k that is a 10% retum|`|sDxdXkMkaa	need at least 18 years old of age.. if you plan to be rich, you can go to take course of how to become a successful trader, probably college or university <br>  During Financial Crisis, in Forex is profitable...but only depends on whether you have the best trader in the world.<br>  If you are very serious to invest and have no intention to lose your money, you can definitely google for HSFX Asset Management and start making consistent profit!|`|GqTSa85daa	When will you have the money to make the money?

Another one accepted us, but the interest rate they offered was OUTRAGEOUS...  then we finally got a good one.<br>  <br>  The trick is to not take it personally.  My husband was SO offended when the second bank tried to offer that ridiculous interest rate.  He took it SO personal.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you keep a copy of your FICA score.  Don't apply to too many and DON'T let every bank inquire your credit because that makes your credit score go down.  Start looking at getting pre-approved FIRST.  Then, when you like the offer, go for it.  We did this with about 10 different banks before we found a few to actually apply to for real.

45d7c44adb0a12f76cad3f9df62378bfaa	For me, I'd have to say ￡400,000.  The reason for this is simple mathematics - it'll give around ￡20,000 per annum return (+/-) interest.<br>  <br>  This is enough to live on, and pay the bills, with some money left over for creature comforts.  However, if you've got that kind of money in the bank, odds are you're doing something that means you can accrue much more, so I'd guess a more realistic figure would be 750k +.<br>  <br>  Also, bear in mind that any leftover money could be saved, and would continue to accumulate interest.  This is why compound interest has famously been called "The Eighth Wonder of the World" by many financial analysts.|`|AA12068499	For clarification on the asker's question,<br>  <br>  All single accounts owned by the same person at the same insured bank are added together and the total is insured up to $100,000.<br>  <br>  The FDIC does not insure the money invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, life insurance policies, annuities, or municipal securities, even if they were bought from an insured bank. And, also does not insure U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, or notes, but those are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.<br>  <br>  Wealth doesn't necessarily make one happy.

I'd also want to me a member of a posh gym where I could take all sorts of classes and exercise in style.  Monthly shopping sprees would be nice, too.<br>  <br>  I could easily do all this on $50,000 a year, since I wouldn't have to allocate any money to savings.  If I had my mortgage paid off, it would be even easier.  So today, I estimate that I'd need about $3,000,000 in the bank today to be confident that I wouldn't run out (I will probably live another 70 years)--and to keep up the lifestyle in the face of inflation (I'll need to take out way more than $50,000/year as the purchasing power of the dollar drops over the next century).|`|f5d437ced2fb03cc831bc300fe98e580aa	About 3 million.

Are you sharing rent with someone now?  If you are renting by yourself, you might want to buy!  Here's the difference between paying rent and mortgage.  With paying rent...you're more than likely paying someone else's mortgage AND setting them up for their retirement.  Their property is building equity as you are paying their mortgage.  Why not just make it your own?! <br>  <br>  Decide what payment you can ACTUALLY afford per month on a mortgage.  Then determine what loan amount will give you that monthly payment.  I would suggest speaking with a mortgage advisor...better yet, a CERTIFIED MORTGAGE PLANNER!  Look through your local phone book or ask you family or friends if they know of someone.  You seem like a smart guy....smart enough to be able to save that much money, at your age and income!  Be even smarter and seek a CERTIFIED MORTGAGE PLANNER!|`|8ruwONI2aa	Good for you for accumulating that much in savings so far! <br>  <br>  As for buying a condo, that is a great goal.  I don't know how much condos cost where you live, but I agree with you that you probably don't make enough money (yet) to comfortably afford the housing costs.  Remember that condos charge monthly HOA dues that are often hundreds of dollars.  You have to pay that in addition to your mortgage, insurance, taxes (can be REALLY high) and P&I insurance (unless you put more than 20% down). <br>  <br>  You also want to make sure that you can afford to save for retirement and other goals; you don't want all your paycheck going to housing costs.  <br>  <br>  Plus, if $20,000 is all you have in savings, you don't want to put all of it into a condo.  I would make sure to leave at least $5,000 in savings for emergencies and other expenses.  And remember that closing costs will be thousands of dollars (budget 5% of the cost of the home).  Plus you will have to pay moving costs and maybe buy new furniture...that $20,000 will be spent run out before you know it, leaving less than you think for a downpayment.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would keep saving for another year or so while continuing to save and perfecting my credit score in the meantime.  Plus, your income will probably go up over that time period.  So when you buy, you'll be in a better, more comfortable financial position.|`|d6013d7446e8edf3266d4ec54b58434eaa	I'm experienced in realestate. <br>  No matter how smart you are never ever buy property unless you can get the mortgage, aford to pay the mortgage plus 15% without cramping your lifestyle, and have at least 10% of the value of the property in cash on hand. For regular properties this is for emergency repairs etc. For condos this is "F-you" money so you can sue the condo owners association if they try to screw you. Right now you should rent. There is no such thing as being too young but you are not moneyed enough. I would suggest you bite the bullet and either rent a cheap apartment with a roommate, or buy a small duplex outside town. You could get a duplex fairly cheaply. Go for the lowest down payment you can get even at the higher rate. When you are done you will have a place to live almost for free because the apartment you rent out will pay your mortgage.

Your attorney can reopen the case and file suit against the creditor in bankruptcy court for violating the discharge order.  (Note: this must be done in federal bankruptcy court, not in state civil court; this is why you need a bankruptcy attorney to pursue it.)|`|6bwMdDJTaa	Nope....You need to tell them you filed and they were included.

PxoKseAiaa	Leasing is where you would sign a contract for a specific period of tenancy.  Most will sign a lease for 12months.  It keeps the rent amount the same for a year.<br>  <br>  Renting is month to month.  That means, the landlord can ask you to leave in 30 days if he wishes.  Also, you can give a 30 day notice to leave if you need to, without incurring the penalties you would with a lease, where you are bound for how ever many months are left in that lease period.   Also, renting month to month, the landlord can raise the rent.|`|UpcGpCm9aa	its a question of grammer i think to lease a property you pay rent. i.e as the notion would go,the rent is the word used for the payment and lease is the word used for the buisness or the contract involved. which is agreed in the same way as rent but the lease does have a more buisiness like fixed contract for a given period of timethe rent is the agreed price for a givern period only its less negotiable as to the raise in price and the situation in the contract iof you dont like it your out but with a lease its already all decided amicably but speaking in adjectives & nouns! the idea of a lease, is the noun qualifying the adjective for the word, rent.,&  vise versa|`|oFiGyMWraa	In laymans terms there is no difference at all.<br>  <br>  Often the word lease is used for long term (many years) tenancies where the tenant pays a large fee up front (called a premium) and then either no rent or only a very small ground rent. In this sort of tenancy the premium is usually almost as much as it would cost to buy the property outright. Because the tenancy lasts for many years both the landlord and tenant can sell their interest on. Properties subject to these long leases are often refered to as leasehold.<br>  <br>  The word rent is usually used in relation to tenancies that are fixed for a few months or a year, or are periodic and last from month to month. Generally there is no up front premium but rent is payable from month to month.<br>  <br>  Whether a landlord chooses to offer long or short term tenancies depends on the type of property, his business needs, the kinds of tenants he wants etc.<br>  <br>  To be pedantic the word lease refers to the agreement or arrangement (ie you lease a house) and the word rent refers to the regular payment that you make in return for the lease (ie you pay a rent of ￡500 a week for the house that you lease).

3d7034f6f80ccb280be8fcf26d641dbbaa	You need to understand what kind of a conveyance a quit claim deed is; A quit claim conveyance is a method that a grantor uses to convey whatever legal interest in the property they possess "if any" if the grantor does not have any legal interest in the property no interest passes to the recipient of the deed, if on the other hand they do have a legal interest in the property that legal interest passes to the recipient. In the event of a liability issue and unlike a warranty deed a quit claim deed does not have any warranties in the conveyance, however if a conveyance is done on purpose to alienate a property right and with the intent to defraud the recipient that's another issue and should always be addressed with proper legal counsel.<br>  If you wish to conduct a more detailed free research on your inquiry you should go to our educational real estate research page <a href="http://www.realestateformnm.com/ResearchLink.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realestateformnm.com/Research...</a> there you will find more links for real estate related research than any other site.<br>  Buena Suerte|`|9dd0fd6d69c0fbb2aa244c13e371af18aa	It does not relieve you of financial responsibility for any loans you may have against the property, unless the loan specifically allows the loan to be assumed.

The better your grades, the better college you can get into, and (maybe more importantly) the more financial aid you can get for college.<br>  <br>  Once in college, take a wide variety of classes. You never know what will spark your interest, but it is EXTREMELY important to pursue a career that you enjoy. Think of some off the wealthiest people out there - Tiger Woods, Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey...they all found something they loved, then worked their a$$es off to become among the best at it.<br>  <br>  Once you've found a subject that interests you, declare that as your major, and then spend your summers doing internships in whatever industry you've chosen. Internships are a GREAT way to gain experience before you even graduate - this will put you years ahead of the competition when it comes time to find a job in the real world.<br>  <br>  Once you start making real money, remember to always, ALWAYS spend less than you earn. It is the only guaranteed way to become wealthy.<br>  <br>  Finally, remember not to place too much importance on money. It is a good servant, but a cruel master. We all eventually realize that the things which make us happiest in life don't come with a price tag. The sooner you realize this, the better off you'll be. Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "that man is richest whose pleasures are cheapest."<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

BUUmkMkfaa	There are lots of online marketing techniques you can use to drive traffic to your web site. Here is some information from one of my articles, "Online Marketing Techniques To Drive More Traffic":<br>  <br>  - Business Blogging. Start a blog for your business and update it on a regular basis. A business blog is an excellent tool to toot your own horn, let the world know about your new products, and tell your target customers why they should do business with you, rather than your competitor. A business blog is also a great tool for attracting potential customers to your blog and your web site. <br>  <br>  - Search Engine Optimization (or SEO). SEO is the process of modifying web page content and meta-information to improve the search engine ranking of the page. Successful search engine optimization will greatly increase the number of visitors that come to your web site since over 70% of people who are looking for products and services use search engines to locate them.<br>  <br>  - Article Writing and Publishing. This is another great way to drive traffic to your web site. When you write and publish your articles, other web site owners pick them up and publish them on their web sites, while giving you a link back to your web site.<br>  <br>  - Newsletter Publishing. Keep in touch with your clients and potential clients by sending out a newsletter on a regular basis. Every time you send out a newsletter, don't forget to invite the subscribers to visit your web site.|`|5defdf4133a719923af089a8d9750d73aa	Hi this program is the easiest to use and all in 1 place <br>  <a href="http://www.greatinfo.us/ad_mailer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatinfo.us/ad_mailer/</a>|`|jOGK5zANaa	endorse it on a tv or find some of them or put posters everywhere....<br>  put it in a billboard make an ad|`|reJCVnA5aa	If your service is local you might try sending flyers via snail mail to your target audience, or hand delivering them. Find out the name of the business owner or manager, research what they may need and develope a small presentation just for them (word will soon start getting around if they like it and/or start using your services, thereby bringing in more). Make an appointment with them requesting what time you may need for the small presentation. IE Mr. ........ I would like to make an appointment with you to discuss what I may be able to do for you to increase your sales and profitability. I know as a small business owner we are always interested in that, aren't we?  I will only take about 15 min (or 20 min etc.) of your time. When would be convenient for you? I have______ or ____ open.  Something like that. Hope this was helpful for local ideas. You seem to have some good input on web ideas. Developing a web page describing what you do is invaluable even in the local market.

861a0c60ecb09d902152f9a7af511fb6aa	I like to travel so I started an online travel business. I bought a website that can book travel accommodations to people and paid me commission everytime someone booked on it.<br>  <br>  I researched how much I needed to purchase a website that was similar to the big companies like travelocity, cheaptickets, orbitz, etc. and they were very expensive ($200,000 or more). But the cheapest and most reliable one I found was selling it for a 1-time fee of $450 and a monthly maintenance fee of $50.<br>  <br>  Now all I do is promote my website to my friends and family. They preferred giving the business to me anyway rather than to the big companies. And I knew that the flight, hotel, cruise, etc. prices were competitive in my website. I would say 75% of the time, my prices were cheaper than the big companies. <br>  <br>  I just started 2 months ago and I've already made money from my friends who've booked their travel on my website (including travel that I booked for myself). So I know that it does work and is not a scam. I'm working on advertising my travel website more to make more money. <br>  <br>  Once I make enough money on this business, I plan to quit my job and do what I want to do, which is travel the world... and promote my website while I'm at it. If this is something that might interest you as well, let me know. I want to help people who are passionate about business and travel, as I am.<br>  <br>  For reference, here is my website:<br>  www.MJTravelCenter.com<br>  <br>  And my email:<br>  olivermarquez3@yahoo.com|`|AA10865244	Want to make money from home, go to www.prepaidlegal.com/hub/bdcooper.

wu3APc5vaa	Para Trastolillo:<br>  1o Gracias pos el extenso discurso sobre las estafas en internet.<br>  <br>  2o No has aportado NADA que diga que GDI es un scam, timo, estafa, etc., como pide la pregunta<br>  <br>  3o El dominio .ws, que el ICANN adjudicó a Western Samoa, ahora pertenece LEGALMENTE (porque lo compraron) a GDI, por lo que ellos lo pueden comercializar LIBRE Y LEGALMENTE. ICANN lo único que dijo es que el sufijo .ws no significa website, si no western samoa, pero no prohibe su comercializacion.<br>  <br>  4o GDI no tiene nada que ver ni con subastas fraudulentas, ni con sitemas piramidales; no es ningún tipo de fraude (si lo fuera podrías demostrarlo, cosa que no has hecho) y no te pide una inversión en ningún tipo de valores de bolsa ni un producto que en realidad no existe. <br>  <br>  5o Aunque toda tu parrafada te ha quedado muy bonita demuestra que realmente no tienes ni idea de lo que es GDI, y de la oportunidad de negocio que representa.<br>  <br>  Bien, creo que es preciso dejar claro que lo que tu pagas a GDI es un dominio, es decir, tu compras tu página web (a la que das el nombre que tú quieres y en la que puedes poner lo que tú quieras) y eso es lo que tu mantienes por 10$ al mes. No pagas por nada, pagas por tu propia página web, que además es muy competente en comparación con otros dominios del mercado. Y lo mejor es que además de proporcionarte un servicio excelente, también te da la oportunidad de que tu inicies tu propio negocio, siendo distribuidor del mismo dominio. ESTO NO ES DINERO MáGICO, HAY QUE GANáRSELO.<br>  <br>  Por lo que, respondiendo a la pregunta principal:<br>  NO, NO HAY PROBLEMAS CON GLOBAL DOMAINS INTERNATIONAL Y NADIE LOS TENDRá, SIMPLEMENTE POR QUE NO ES UN TIMO|`|GXnu7BUdaa	no tengo quejas para GDI, recien estoy empezando en esto y espero que me vaya bien, creo que tenes razon si no me muevo no voy a ganar nada...|`|78091456ed8d1783388e75973db8d4e6aa	?No hay porqué criticar nada. Cada uno con su dinero puede hacer lo que desee!<br>  ?Yo, particularmente, tengo una política: No gastarme ni un céntimo en Internet. Las empresas que ofrecen esos maravillosos ingresos que descuenten lo que hay que pagar mensualmente de dichos beneficios!<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  El ICANN está en contra de los procesos de pre-registro en cualquiera de las nuevas categorías (registrar cuando todavía no se ha autorizado el inicio de operaciones de las organizaciones responsables del registro), y los que lo están haciendo lo hacen bajo su propio riesgo. <br>  <br>  A la fecha de emisión de este artículo (Diciembre del 2001), las primeras tres nuevas categorías .info, .biz y .name están ya disponibles para registro de nuevos dominios.<br>  <br>  <br>  El caso de los dominios .ws y .bz <br>  <br>  Global Domains International, Inc., organización que desde principios del a?o 2000 es responsable del registro y administración de los dominios .ws, solicitó al ICANN no incorporar las categorías .web ni .site por una supuesta violación de los derechos sobre el TLD .ws que ellos comercializan. Sin embargo, el propio ICANN ha hecho del conocimiento público que el sufijo .ws no obedece a website, como esta empresa lo ha venido mercadeando, sino al país de Samoa (antiguamente llamado Western Samoa). <br>  <br>  Un caso similar es el de los dominios .bz, cuyos derechos están reservados por la empresa Economic Solutions, Inc, quienes comercializan este TLD como una categoría de sitios web de negocios (business), tras un contrato con el gobierno de Belice para el uso de su identificación como país .bz (Belize). El ICANN autorizó dentro del nuevo paquete de TLDs, el de .biz para negocios.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>    principales estafas en Internet  <br>  <br>  Tal y como puede verse, las estafas en Internet se asemejan mucho de aquellas estafas que se han llevado a cabo toda la vida. Las principales diferencias son que a través de Internet se puede llegar a más gente en menos tiempo y que se puede hacer sin dar la cara, disminuyendo en principio el riesgo para el estafador. Sin embargo, en los últimos a?os se han dado grandes pasos en la lucha contra este tipo de delitos, como la creación de la agencia de delitos informáticos de la policía nacional. <br>  <br>  Fraudes en subastas<br>  A pesar de las medidas de seguridad que implementan los principales portales de subastas online, existen vendedores desaprensivos que se aprovechan de los clientes a los que se adjudica la subasta. Una vez el cliente realiza el pago, éste recibe un producto que no se corresponde con el que se esperaba recibir, o bien se recibe un producto sin valor alguno. Conocemos casos en los que se han llegado a recibir ladrillos en vez de libros. <br>  <br>  Redes Piramidales <br>  Estos fraudes se suelen realizar a través de ofertas de empleo falsas o de spam, y se basan en ofrecer mucho dinero fácil mediante la comercialización de productos con un cierto método de gran efectividad. Para comenzar con el empleo, es necesario hacer una inversión inicial y adquirir los productos que posteriormente tendrán que venderse. Posteriormente, el método de venta consiste en reclutar otros vendedores a través de ofertas de trabajo pagadas por uno mismo y cuyo objetivo es captar a terceros con el mismo método con el que uno ha sido captado. Los nuevos captados tendrán que realizar la inversión inicial y comprarnos los productos, por lo que al final se constituye la estructura piramidal. Llega un momento en el que la cadena se rompe, por lo que sólo ganan los primeros que entraron en ella. <br>  <br>  “Trabaje desde su propia casa" <br>  Como en el caso de las redes piramidales, suele realizarse a través de ofertas de empleo, ofreciéndose la oportunidad de trabajar desde casa y ser su propio jefe, además de prometer grandes beneficios. Para comenzar con la oportunidad de negocio o empleo es necesario invertir en la compra de productos que terminan siendo imposibles de vender. <br>  <br>  Recomendaciones de inversión <br>  últimamente muy habituales, son emails en los que se aconseja la compra de acciones de la empresa X, que suele ser desconocida para el gran público pero que realmente existe, y que en los próximos días su cotización se disparará en bolsa. Las acciones en venta suelen ser las del estafador, que las compró a un valor muy inferior del que, mediante esta técnica, consiguen. Cuando la víctima se percata de que es una estafa, se encuentra en posesión de unas acciones revalorizadas de manera fraudulenta que cuyo valor real es inexistente, o cuanto menos mucho inferior al abonado. <br>  <br>  Fraudes en viajes o paquetes vacacionales <br>  También llevado a la práctica en el mundo offline, consiste en la venta de paquetes vacacionales de una calidad superior a la que realmente se presta en su destino. <br>  <br>  Fraudes telefónicos <br>  Un sistema bastante extendido en los sitios de sexo consiste en pedirle que se baje un programa y lo instale en su ordenador para que le permite entrar gratuitamente en la web. Pero lo que sucede es que, sin que usted lo sepa, el programa marca un número internacional de pago (tipo 906 en Espa?a) a través del cual se accede a la web, por lo que mientras usted se divierte viendo fotos y vídeos su factura telefónica se incrementa a velocidad de vértigo. <br>  <br>  Fraudes en productos farmacéuticos <br>  Este tipo de estafas se aprovecha de la salud de las víctimas al ofrecer recetas milagrosas que curan cualquier enfermedad. Estos productos, al no estar sometidos a ningún tipo de control sanitario, pueden llegar a suponer un riesgo para la salud, además de no producir los resultados prometidos. <br>  <br>   recomendaciones para evitar estafas  <br>  <br>  Como en el mundo offline, la prudencia y el sentido común son las principales armas con las que uno cuenta. Si tiene alguna sospecha, no dude en informarse primero y buscar en Internet más información al respecto.<br>  <br>  A continuación le mostramos algunas recomendaciones para no caer en las estafas a través de email:<br>  <br>  Sino conoce el remitente, no haga caso del email.<br>  <br>  Si se le pide llamar por teléfono a un número extranjero, 806, 807, 906, etc, no lo haga, ya que puede llegar a pagar varios euros por minuto.<br>  <br>  Si le ofrecen ganar millones de sin esfuerzo, no haga caso del email. <br>  <br>  Si el remitente es el director de una multinacional, un ministro, un ex presidente, o un rey de un país del que no ha oído ni hablar, seguro que es una estafa. <br>  <br>  Si recibe ofertas de tiendas o marcas que no conoce o donde no se ha inscrito, elimine el email.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Postdata para el usuario que pregunta y para martynx<br>  1.- ?Como ya expliqué cada uno con su dinero hace lo que desee!<br>  2.- ?No entro ni salgo en si es legal o no. Todos y cada uno podemos buscar información en Internet, que es la mayor Base de Datos existente hoy en día y hacernos una idea de lo que nos conviene o no nos conviene!<br>  3.- ?Yo (PERSONALMENTE)  tengo una política, y es no gastarme ni un céntimo en Internet. En primer lugar porque no hay un sitio físico en el que poder reflejar las quejas que creas oportunas y en segundo lugar porque sigo diciendo lo mismo, que me descuenten lo que voy aganar de lo que tengo que pagar!<br>  4.- Las recomendaciones para evitar estafas están a disposición de todos en Internet (y no digo quer esta compa?ía lo sea) y cada uno es muy suyo de seguirlas o no!<br>  5,. Y por último, si yo he dado una gran parrafada no digamos los que nos quieren convencer (y tampoco estoy hablando de esta compa?ía) de que podemos ganar miles de Euroas invirtiendo unos pocos Euros. Hasta la decha nadie ha dado Euros por céntimos!<br>  UN foro:<br>  <a href="http://emarket.com.do/foros/viewtopic.php?p=10065&sid=f492aaa63642c650906060bb1a465498" rel="nofollow">http://emarket.com.do/foros/viewtopic.ph...</a><br>  <br>  Muchas gracias por aguantar mis "parrafadas".
Em75gzPFaa	No.  Actually the Philippines has labor laws that is not favorable for employers to hire part-time. 8 hours is the mandatory work time.  There is no hourly pay and workers are paid on a daily basis. Although employers would want to help job-seekers, it's like getting a gun and shooting himself.  Sad to say, the filipino employee in their own country are nasty when it comes to labor rights.  Once given a part-time job, they will go report to the labor department once things go wrong or they get fired, and the often impartial labor department will side with the employee because he was not given an enough number of hours to work which is 8 even when they know it is part-time. And most of these employees part-time or otherwise will most of the time pursue the case for monetary gains.  The poor employer in the meantime have no alternative but to pay up, just for the hassle to go away, and that is what they get for helping. No waiver helps either.<br>  <br>  Employers do hire undergraduates as long as they are able to meet a company's requirements like being a salesman, saleslady but on an 8 hour basis.|`|8d6ae5a42dddca82be705f10f6b74e58aa	Good luck with that...<br>  <br>  Only grads get jobs in Philippines.

Make a sale or get nothing.<br>  <br>  Commissions can be good, but if you're selling an average or lower end house, it may not be enough to justify the work. People think that you get 6%, but you don't. The commission, 6%, 5%, 4%, or even sometimes 3.5% is split between the listing agency and the selling agency. That means if the seller pays a 6% commission to the listing agency, and you bring a buyer, both agencies will get 3% if the listing agency splits it evenly. Out of the 3% that your agency got, you get your split, which can be less than 50%. <br>  <br>  That means that it is possible that you could spend months working with a buyer who buys a property for $100,000 that has a 2% fee to the buyer agency, so your agency gets $2,000 and they pay you slightly less than $1000 of that money. You then have to pay extra SS tax, pay your business expenses, and manage your own retirement account.

Then if I still had too many, I would throw away the Associates Degrees.<br>  <br>  So, yes go for an Associates Degree, and continue in school to get your Bachelor's while you are looking for a job.  There are as many as 10 to 20 resumes received for every computer job opening these days, so anything that you can do that will show that you have what it takes is a good thing.<br>  <br>  BTW, most on-line degrees aren't worth the paper they are printed on, so go with a reputable and accredited university that also has a real campus...|`|NZuJR79oaa	The Bachelors degree will open more doors, however it is most likely possible that you can get an associates and then go for the bachelors without having to take any additional courses. (other than the 60 credits making the difference between an associates and bachelors).<br>  <br>  I would go for an associates, and then see what happens.  It is key in this line of work to develop an excellent portfolio highlighting your work.

That in its self is fraud and illegal on his part. So talk to the IRS and let them handle the situation. You do not have to do anything. IRS hates fraud and will pull his last few years returns also to see if those returns were filed legally.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Filing single when actually married is illegally.  You may owe money for the past year when you filed single while actually married.<br>  <br>  All married persons who file must either (a) file "married filing separately" (alone), or file "married filing separately" (together).<br>  <br>  He, like any married person, is allowed to file "married filing separately", if he wants to do so.  If he is required to file and you do not file jointly with him, then he MUST file as "married filing separately".<br>  <br>  If he filed "married filing jointly" without you, that was illegal.  You should immediately notify the IRS that you did not file jointly.<br>  <br>  In either case, you should file as "married filing separately" as soon as possible.  <br>  <br>  You must also amend your filing status on the returns where you incorrectly stated that you were single.  To change a return that you already filed, use Form 1040X.  This form cannot be e-filed; send it by U.S. mail.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Well, you couldn't file single last year because you weren't.  (There is no such thing as common law separated.  If you haven't been to court, you do not have a legal separation agreement either.)  If you filed single last year, you need to amend.  If you claimed anything like EIC or education benefits, you will owe money back. <br>  <br>  So you file MFS, by mail and assert to the IRS that you did not file jointly.  Your proof is that YOUR tax return has YOUR W-2 income on it; his MFJ doesn't.

3mAgM405aa	Online medical billing and coding schools are very suspect when it comes to training on the latest medical/billing software since most medical centers have very customized medical software which is not normally shared with trade schools and the like. In the real world of medical billing and coding, training occurs on-the-job. We therefore do not recommend that you subscribe to any online school for medical billing and coding and concentrate on entering a medical internship program at your local medical facility/center for medical billing/coding.<br>  <br>  On another subject: the major bulk of medical billing/coding work in the U.S. has been greatly curtailed by state privacy laws as it pertains to medical records and patient confidentiality. The vast majority of medical records are kept in recordkeeping departments within medical centers and any billing/coding work is done "in-house," not "outsourced."

The biggest difference is my income was about 60% of yours.|`|ulFJedwIaa	student loan isn't a big problem. <br>  <br>  Credit Card debt is a major no-no, you should use part of your down payment to payoff the credit card debt.<br>  <br>  Due this, your take home $ every month is about 4200, add up your expense, car payment, insurance, including estimated mortgage including property tax, HOA. The closer to $2100, the less chance you have to get a good term loan. <br>  <br>  Also, just FYI - I"m not sure what state you are from, but at least in CA, if you don't put down 20%, there is additional of mortgage insurance you have to pay, I think it's like 1%. <br>  <br>  Also, don't forget about closing cost, I always estimate $4000 for mine. Could be alot less now.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I  agree with Pengy. He is right about the down payments of 3% to 5%. If you don't have enough credit to establish your willingness to repay debts you can use what is called alternate credit sources, like rent, utility bills, things purchased from small companies that do not report to credit bureaus, etc. The lender will send what is called a Verification form to these companies where they attest to your good paying record. It's done all the time when people have only a few or no  credit lines on their credit report. Just remember the  amount of mortgage you qualify on paper is not necessarily what you can afford. Some of the things not considered in your debt ratio are utilities, car insurance, car expense like repairs or the amount of gas you use.
pt6wIlS1aa	High School<br>  Top grades in high school so you can get into a good college. If your school has a debate team, get on it so you can start learning how to argue either side of an issue. Other classes to pay special attention to in high school:<br>  Advanced English, especially argumentative and expositive writing. You can research things like famous court cases or other aspects of the practice of law as your topic for your papers.<br>  Geometry, for the proofs<br>  Psychology, as you'll need to understand how people think<br>  Government, as prosecutors operate within the government <br>  Sociology, not essential, but it shows you how people think within groups, organizations<br>  <br>  College<br>  Top grades in college. Any major is fine, but take a few classes in the area of law you want to be a prosecutor in, things like criminology, women's issues, racial or social issues, environmental issues, etc. Also take logic, at least one communications class, any political science or business classes that look relevant, any undergrad law classes you can get into. <br>  Maybe do an independent research project on some area of law that interests you. Look for jobs or internships with law firms, even if it's just receptionist or filing clerk work.<br>  Spend some spare time hanging out in courtrooms, studying the cases. If you consistently see a prosecutor whose style you like, introduce yourself. Don't push yourself on them, but keep the contact and maybe down the line ask questions and try to cultivate the person as a mentor.<br>  Leisure reading: John Grisham's books<br>  <br>  Law School<br>  Try for the best one you can get into. Get top grades. Pay special attention to great prosecutors that you learn about. Also see where prosecutors have failed and analyze why and what could have been done better. <br>  Forge contacts among your fellow students and law professors for the future. <br>  <br>  Career<br>  When looking for a position within a law firm, research the firm's history, the cases they handled, their success rate. Pick your firm carefully. <br>  A lot of people who were tops in school get out and then act like bumpkins, all unsure of themselves, following rules rigidly, etc. A lot of cases are about manipulation of the courts, the judges, the defense council, the client, even the law. Develop savvy. The law may be in favor of the defense; you may be more successful settling out of court, delaying, moving to another court, etc. Learn tactics.<br>  <br>  Success<br>  It comes from winning your cases, or at least avoiding a record of losing them. Having the law on your side helps, but so does knowing how to perform in the courtroom, knowing how to work things so they're in your favor, spinning things so your clients accept partial successes or even failures as better than it might have been. If you can do it with honor and ethics, even better. In fact, working cases honorably may be the better definition of success.|`|m45R3s5Daa	all I can say is that to be a good lawyers you have to have no conscience. you have to learn to act infront of people and you have to be sharp and agressive. you have to learn to twist the truth ever so much.  another words, you have to be a damn good actor who knows how to debate and to lie.

coXB7vf1aa	No, it's not illegal, but it's not terribly helpful for your website either.<br>  <br>  If you're doing pay-per-click advertising, especially with Google Adwords, you can drive up an unnecessarily tremendous cost of wasted clicks.<br>  <br>  If you're doing search engine optimization, you will get untargeted traffic to your site, and you will have a hard time getting people to buy from your site because it's not what they were looking for.<br>  <br>  What some people do, but they don't pay close attention, is buy clicks from sites who have no problem submitting to directories of untargeted traffic.  These "traffic sellers" use software that cheats the search engine algorithms and drive up unnecessarily high clicks.<br>  <br>  People who have websites with Adsense ads (the reverse of Adwords) often fall for this method because they think that by flooding this kind of traffic to their site, they'll get tons of clicks on their ads, hence more ad revenue.<br>  <br>  Google strictly prohibits this and considers it click fraud.  Their algorithms are very sensitive to unnatural clicks.  I've lost Adsense earnnings because of this method in the past.  Do it twice, and count on being banned from Adsense.<br>  <br>  Why is Google strict about this?  Look at it from their point of view.<br>  <br>  People recognize that Google is the largest search engine in the world.  They are willing to spend their money using Google's advertising service.  Google is willing to share some of that ad revenue with your website for allowing their ads to be on your website.  <br>  <br>  If you find a way to cheat the system, and the advertisers find out people have been clicking on their ads with no intention of buying anything thereby wasting their money, they will blame or sue Google for sheer carelessness.  <br>  <br>  If Google gets no money, you get no money.  They'll cut you off to save their system.  It's also unfair to people trying to market legitimately. <br>  <br>  Even if you aren't using any of Google's products or services, you're still in some way or another dependent on Google for gaining traffic.  You Tube is owned by Google.  Blogger is owned by Google.  Everything on the internet is influenced in some way shape or form by Google. Smaller search engines are dependent on their indexing with Google.<br>  <br>  It's best to stick to the rules.|`|2ccf66984526063bdbf7c0a271981fcbaa	It may bring you lots of traffic in the beginning however most people once they click through will leave.<br>  <br>  Also, search engines have algorothms that review your site to decide where you rank when you come up when users search. <br>  <br>  If you try to purchase keywords that aren't relevant, most of your ads will be reviewed by someone and they can and will "decline" running your ad.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is don't be tricky.

I don't suggest truck driving for anyone who is going to get married and have children because you will be gone alot but if you are over 23 yrs of age, it is an option for short term training.  Keep in mind that trucking is also affected by the economy more so now than ever so you may not make a lot of money.  It is expensive to "live on the road" too.  I suggest going to your local employment office and talk to them about this.  I also suggest maybe something like a Plumber or Electrician apprentice program.  Just check with your local community college or your local trade schools.  Personally, I think you need some sort of training beyond high school to get a decent job or even a job at all.  It is harder and harder to find a job these days.  My husband is a highly skilled carpenter and has been unemployed since December.  My son just graduated this year and after looking for a job since then, he's decided to go to Lincoln Tech for automotive technology.

If it is an indemnity health insurance plan, they generally will not cover preventative treatments. Preventative treatments are things like annual check ups and immunizations. Preventative treatments are usually covered by HMO plans however. <br>  <br>  Beyond basic preventative treatments, the lines are vary gray of what a plan covers and what it does not, as ever plan is different, as is every company. The amount of coverage that you have can also determine the type of treatments that you are eligible for. Most plans might include routine eye exams, but do not pay for things such as glasses and contacts which are paid for by vision plans. However if you require prescription eye drops from a doctor, some plans will pay for them. Some plans have a maximum number of visits per year, a maximum amount of benefits that can be used, and other "clauses" that determine what is and is not covered. <br>  <br>  As for things that plans do not cover, it varies by plan. Some common things that are not covered:<br>  Glasses, contact lenses<br>  Dental services (unless it's an emergency like your tooth gets knocked out and you go to an emergency room instead of a dentist)<br>  Weight loss products<br>  Smoking cessation programs<br>  Accupuncture<br>  Fertility treatments<br>  Elective treatments are almost never covered and include things like cosmetic surgery and liposuction <br>  Fertility treatments<br>  <br>  Some health insurances won't cover your pregnancy if you don't know when you conceived...crazy but true!<br>  <br>  In addition some health insurance programs have a list of medications that they will not cover, some won't cover treatment related to pre-existing conditions, the list goes on and on.|`|BqPr9jDUaa	Depends on the provoder I would call them and ask for a general list.|`|093adb8ec6136150f94ebe4b7a62899eaa	Many policies do not cover weight loss surgery. <br>  Plastic surgery is sometimes not covered<br>  Some policies do not cover ambulance transport<br>  Some policies do not cover private hospital rooms

On top of that I get a pretty good salary too!<br>  The degree course is the one to do, so that's good, and the way nursing is going, you'll probably need to do your Masters as well, depending on what you decide to specialise in.  It's a world over qualification and I wish you all the best on your chosen path!  It will change you, enrich you and you'll be an even better person for it.|`|TTghPaZhaa	OK my answer is a negative one so be prepared.  Now all I have ever done is med/surg and I STRONGLY recommend staying out of this unless it is just temporary because you do learn a lot, but here's my view on nursing...<br>  Some nights I see more diarrhea than a town sewer, I've had patients that have put it in their mouths, threw it at me and crapped it in the floor only to land on my shoes.<br>  -I bet I run 5 miles a night searching for everything under the sun from ice, sherbert, pumps, restraints, blankets and everything in-between.<br>  -I have more patients than I can handle almost every night, and oh yeah I'm legally responsible for them for over 12 hours.<br>  -The doctor messes up, it's the nurses fault--you should have caught the mistake.<br>  -The pharmacy messes up, yep....my fault, I should know everything about every medicine and should catch the mistake...after all I'm the person administering it.<br>  -The people above you only care about money...the bottom line, they truly do not care about you or the patients...<br>  -The patients are rude, the families are rude...if they're mad at the doctor, you get to hear it for the next 12 hours.<br>  -I've been choked, hit, scratched, bit, spit on, barfed on, sneezed on, and there's no amount of safety equipment that protects you 100 percent.<br>  -If you have a good back now, you won't in 5 years because you'll spend every night lifting around on ppl 3 times your size.<br>  The money isn't worth it in my opinion unless you can get into a management position.  I plan on getting out of nursing ASAP.<br>  The ONLY good that nursing has done for me is provide money to live off of, but there are too many other jobs that will do the same!!!!
AA11573642	This is simple , universal problem. You cannot please everyone working under you. Regarding the lady employee, you have yourself stated that "One of the employees in the meeting got upset, started attacking some of the other employees for their behavior", and hence she did not make any allegation  of "age discrimination" against you.<br>  Please be tough and after all, your position is to get things done. If any one is an  impediment  continuously, please ask the management to take action against them.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	Tough job - - - any accusation of discrimination leaves everyone in a difficult position.<br>  <br>  However, 4 steps<br>  <br>  step1 - you've been accused, you must be given an opportunity to address the accusation - - - ask your line manager to arrange a meeting between the three of you. You also want to do this because it gives you control - not matter how you feel! Never let accusations drop because they never disappear and you never know when they will re-surface. If the team seem you dealing with such a difficult issue with confidence and a clear plan you will have more of their respect and they are more likely to dismiss accusations.<br>  <br>  step 2 - at the meeting, ask her if she is still of the same mind (basically, you repeat what she has said about you and then ask her whether she still feels this is truly the case, and ask for examples (remember, we all see things from different perspectives. You might not see what she has seen, or she might feel that she needs more help - so more attention - but doesn't want to admit this). Explain that you had no intention of being ageist and that you always felt you were giving everyone equal time according to their need.<br>  <br>  Step 3 - agree a way of working with her. Ask her what she'd like to see change - if it's reasonable, agree that with her; tell her that she (and everyone else) is welcome to come and speak to you whenever you're available (don't say 'at any time', employees don't understand you have work to do). Remember you're drawing up a solution for everyone - not just your accuser.<br>  <br>  Step 4 - next staff meeting, speak about the accusation and explain that there's been a meeting and that ................. has been agreed. Finish off by saying, you hope these new. re-expressed arrangements is acceptable to all but that you will happily work with the team to find a more universally appropriate system is there are any issues and that you will whenever possible meet the individual need of your staff team.<br>  <br>  Casual conversation - this will take a while to happen, in the meantime, always say good morning and goodnight etc, always check how she's getting on (don't do this in a big way, just subtle ' how's it going? Oh, by the way . . .  have you . . . . ?) do this to everyone .... not just her.  This means you have to change your management style for a while ..  a good thing, it sounds as though you need to distance yourself a tad more - friendly but not a friend.<br>  <br>  Finally, the first thing a manager needs is to be unemotional and dispassionate - a problem is an opportunity for change - you want to and need to be in charge of that change.<br>  <br>  BTW make sure it's all recorded - in your records, your employees, your procedures etc - - - wherever it fits in and in the minutes of the meeting you circulate to the staff. This is vital.
01hrZfBoaa	There's a few things you can do.<br>  <br>  1. You can talk to her. Try reasoning with her. Never works with situations like these, but it's good to do to show that you're the better person when you have to do things the hard way.<br>  <br>  2. You can choose to leave her out of your resume. You don't HAVE to put her on it.<br>  <br>  3. You can plainly and honestly say what happened. You can say that you worked at the restaurant for 2 years and you gave 4 months notice and she fired you on the spot for it and that she shouldn't be called for a reference. The fact that you were there for 2 years says that you were worth keeping around.<br>  <br>  4. You can find out exactly what she's saying about you and slap her with a slander suit. She would have to pay out a bunch of money for all the time you're unemployed if you can prove what she is saying is inaccurate. It's damaging your reputation and if she can't prove what she's saying, she's breaking the law. <br>  <br>  5. You could threaten to dig up any dirt on her. Every restaurant has their unlawful practices. Talk to her about it and say that if she keeps slandering you, you'll report whatever her practices are. If you worked there for 2 years, you should have a couple tidbits.<br>  <br>  (headgirl97 pointed out that 5 can open up a huge can of worms and make the situation worse. This is why i left it for number five and should only be used if everything else has failed. 5 is one of those "Do at your own risk" answers that could work well for you or could make things a lot worse.)|`|gHRbi3c5aa	I agree with almost everything Nebetsu says except point no 5 - - -  never ever ever threaten because you just never know how someone will react and could end up making a bad situation worse.<br>  <br>  Explaining to any prospective employer the circumstances under which your previous job ended is a good idea. You can do that as you apply.<br>  <br>  A good idea is to get references from previous employers, if these are good they will counterbalance the reference from your most recent employer and, because you've also given an explanation as to what happened, it will give better value to your explanation and give you a better chance to get a job.<br>  <br>  good luck!

azBErFyYaa	In my opinion, tech schools are a waste of money and time.  You do not get any type of degree and the credits can never be used at another institution.  If you are planning on getting your associate's degree and higher, don't waste your time with the technical school.  Because if you were to just take the prerequisites and classes at your community college for nursing, your credits will count and get you closer to the degree.  <br>  <br>  Also, technical schools normally don't accept financial aid.  They want cash or credit card up front to even attend.  So it's way better to go to a community college.  Check your local county colleges and see what their nursing programs are like, and pick one.  The credits will transfer over if you decide to go to a University and pursue your Bachelor's degree down the road...<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Yes, you can go all the way to a Doctorate degree in nursing if that's where you want to go with it. <br>  <br>  You can get your RN license with the Associate's Degree, get to work, find an employer that will offer tuition assistance to help pay for you to complete your BSN (which these days can be done online if you choose), or find a RN to Masters degree, which skips about 1 year of the BSN program and you end up with your MSN instead, where you can focus in any number of areas, such as an MSN in Leadership / Management, you could be a Nurse Practitioner or Clinical Nurse Specialist or a Nurse Educator, you could specialize in Public Health Nursing, etc. Nursing is a great career because of all the possibilities that are available to you, it's such a diverse career, there are so many things to do other than regular patient care in a hospital or clinic. Part of what you learn in your Assoc. degree RN program is about the wide variety of options.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	Start off as an LPN then you can work on n associates degree from there to a bachelors to a masters

NExIpyWRaa	No it does not count in any way. A 401a plan is an opt out plan from Social Security by government employees. The funds going into the 401a are those that would have gone to SS. Both the employee and the employer pay into the 401a at a rate of 6.2% each. If the employer also offered a 401k in addition to the 401a then that could effect the ability to put into a ROTH or other IRA type plan. But because the 401a is a Private retirement security plan in lew of a government retirement security plan (Social Security) then it doesn't effect your ability to put into IRAs. All State and Local government workers in Alaska do not pay into Social Security. Up here its called the State of Alaska SBS account. The State also has a 401k in addition to the 401a. Instead of putting into an IRA if you have a 401a then I would first obtain disability insurance. I have a friend who worked for the State government. Because government employees do not pay into Social Security under the 401a plan they are not eligible to receive Social Security disability if they are unable to work due to a disability. This is true even if they have enough paid in from a privious job. Once you opt out of Social Security you cant opt back in for SS disibility. If you were to have had the required 40 quarters paid into SS and also had a 401a then you can collect SS at 67 in addition to the 401a but for disibility you could not collect SS if you are covered under a 401a plan this is why the government offers those under 401a plans the ability to buy extra private disability insurance. Make sure you have the disability insurance inplace first...then do the IRA if you so desire. Dont do as my friend did and find out AFTER you become disabled what you should have done. Trust me on this.

Az87btqBaa	I could be wrong, but Im pretty sure you have to add funds to paypal, I dont think it can just debit your card. I think you have to add your card, then it takes like 3 days to transfer funds from your debit card to your paypal account, and THEN you can buy something using paypal. I could be wrong though. Im also pretty sure that paypal has to verify a bank account if you open a paypal account, so they deposit an amount in your bank account in 3 days to a week, and then you look in your bank account to see how much they deposited (its going to be something between .15 cents to .45 cents), then you have to take that number and enter it in at paypal so they can see that it was actually your bank account that you signed up with.

wQzUVbaraa	It's probably a fun profession, but I don't know if you'd be able to live off it. It's a very competitive business, and you'd have to invest a lot of time (and probably a good chunk of money) to get anywhere. <br>  You also probably need to have a good eye- an instinct for what looks good, and what will look good, which some people aren't exactly born with. :/<br>  <br>  Anyway, I personally think that if you're committed, you can make anything happen.<br>  <br>  I'm not a professional, but I think it's safe to say that you need a good SLR, I'd recommend digital. You should know how to use film cameras though, and how to develop film. Obviously a tripod is a good idea, as well as maybe one of those triggers that allow you to take a picture without shaking the camera.<br>  <br>  As for what kind of camera, in my opinion, you can't go wrong with a Canon. :)<br>  <br>  Take classes, talk to people who have had success in the business, and most of all, have fun.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Finding a  job is difficult<br>  Newspapers are slowing closing since people don't read them anymore.<br>  All those photographers are working at studios trying to sell (desperately) 100 portraits for $10.<br>  <br>  I remember living in a place where the joke was that all the people livingin boxes were photographers - since there were no jobs for them.<br>  /|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	It's interesting as 20 years ago when I left school I was dying to be a photographer.  I didn't do it as there was talk about it becoming a dying artform & then eventually digital came out & again people said photography was a dying trade as people will take their own photos now that it's easier to just print your own & camera's are more advanced & you don't need to adjust them so much, etc.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure whether there has been a downturn in professional photographers over the years or not.  I do know that alot of people photograph & videorecord their own weddings these days to save money so that must have caused a downturn.<br>  <br>  You need to research the industry, you usually would have to be self employed as a photographer so you need to find out if there is enough work available to sustain you.  Perhaps you would be happy to work at it just part time & do something more stable part time, like keeping on with the electrician work to support the photography career.<br>  <br>  I know it can be hard to get work like being a photographer for newspapers & magazines & getting jobs for advertising firms, like shoots for magazine ads & billboards, etc.<br>  <br>  I think one thing that can be good to get into is taking glamour or style shots of regular people.  If you cut your prices as low as possible then that will filter out the competition.  See <a href="http://bodyshots.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">http://bodyshots.co.nz/</a> as an example of what I mean.  These places usually advertise in local newspapers but I wonder if a flyer in peoples letterboxes might be good or advertising online on websites or through google, etc.  Take some shots of relatives & friends first so you can show them to people as examples of your work & hire a hair & make up artist to do that side of things (trust me, there's plenty of them that have done all the courses & have never had any work so it shouldn't be too hard to find one to collaborate with).<br>  <br>  I still take loads of photo's now & still love photography & have always done it as a hobby (used to have darkroom equipment but when digital came out all the chemicals went way up in price).  I do think you should be able to make some kind of part time living out of it if you live in a city & even just doing the studies for the love of photography you might find enriching (but you might not be happy about what it cost you if you find it hard to get work to pay back the study fees, etc).  In hindsight I wish I had just studied it 20 years ago, even if it didn't amount to anything, at least I would have learned more about something I love & emersed myself in it for awhile & could have used it for family gatherings & professional portraits of family & friends, etc.|`|79DJrAraaa	if you like it yes if you dont like it no, i dont like it and i would say no its not a good career. it depends how you like to work and what you like to work with

I get this type of question asked pretty regularly, so I will start by saying you need to exercise caution when adding someone to your deed, because once you do, you cannot remove them without their consent and approval. <br>  <br>  By adding his name to the deed, you are effectively giving him at least a 50% interest in the property, including all equity, and possibly up to 100% interest if the deed is held in joint tenancy instead of tenants in common.  <br>  <br>  Were you my client, I would ask you what benefit is there to add your boyfriend to the deed to your home? It will not improve his credit, unless he was originally on the mortgage note, but it could place your home at risk should he ever be sued.<br>  <br>  Caution is in order here.  Perhaps you might seek counsel from a real estate attorney before you make a move like this.<br>  <br>  In order to add him to the deed, you need to contact a title company or real estate attorney, and have them complete and file a Quit Claim Deed that will be signed by you transferring interest in the home. Once filed, he has legal interest in the property and removing him at a later date  could prove difficult.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10590885	Yep - you then share all equity in the property equally.  If you are upside down in the house - they they just share in that too. Get legal council before you do this.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Possibly. If there is an equity in the property, the person added will have a piece of the equity. That person will also OWN an undivided part of the property, so do this with care, as he will have an equal part with anyone else on the deed. And, he will also have an equal voice in any decisions made about the property.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|AA11132354	Maybe.<br>  Is there any equity in the property?  Putting them on deed gives them an undivided interest in property with other owners.
Ch9TedMcaa	Gold will continue to rise as long as inflation continues to rise.|`|9r2SBjA1aa	gold is a bubble and it will burst|`|NQoyw4T5aa	No one knows the future price of gold. It's certainly had a good run recently, and the world markets look sick enough to possibly sustain the high price of gold, but that's one commodity that has a reputation for crashing rapidly. It will in the future--on Monday, or in a decade, I can't say when. And you WON'T be smart enough to get out in time. I'd watch out. Markets that have been moving up always attract naive suckers--and no, I'm not necessarily talking about you.<br>  <br>  What's smart about your question is that you apparently have some money to invest. Be extra smart--study up on stocks for a time in the future when you can really pick up bargains. Your best investment is education. Read IBD, the newspaper, for instance, and other sources of info on the markets.|`|70pknKHraa	It's always been a good idea to keep perhaps 5% or less of your portfolio in gold, but I don't see it as a brilliant investment right now. With asset prices declining everywhere, I don't see inflation anywhere. Real estate prices are cratering. Stock prices are cratering. Commodity prices are cratering. Look at oil prices. Look at corrugated boxboard prices. Look at steel or aluminum prices. They're all selling at small fractions of where they were last year. <br>  <br>  I believe the old adage of "Buying low and selling high" is still valid. Gold is high, and U.S. high quality stock prices are low.  Tell me which you should buy.<br>  <br>  I think this is ample evidence to buy high quality stocks and very little reason to buy gold.<br>  <br>  Buy quality and diversify.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	I agree with the first answer.  It's a bubble and I hate bubbles because of the lack of stable growth.  You get exited on the boom, then devastated on the bust.<br>  <br>  The trend will either fail to significantly break above $1000 and reverse, or it will become a bubble that will zoom up and crash down hard, killing the late speculators who bought late at the tip of the gold spike.<br>  <br>  Oils a better commodity.  It has far more practical use than gold and if you wait for it to break above 50/barrel which will take 1-2 months of patience you'll be at the start of a trend.<br>  <br>  Remember the dot com boom.  Tech stocks would eventually become as advanced as thought back in the '90's, but people got too far ahead of themselves and paid the price in 2000.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself what practical use does gold really have?  My belief is the gold buying frenzy is gaining momentum.  I don't trust it.<br>  <br>  It's bullish, but becoming speculative and unstable.

This is a dream of mine as well.  Unfortunately due to the economy many people are NOT going out to eat as much, but a great way to get business nowadays is to have incredibly fresh products but charge cheap prices.

I am expecting gold to be between $1200-1500/oz by summer, and if the recession continues, the govt continues to print money and the dollar tanks (as many are expecting all of these by the end of the year) you can expect historic highs for both gold and silver. It could easily move to $2000/oz by early next year, with silver up to $50/oz.<br>  <br>  Plenty of time to buy right now. Look at the junior gold miners, especially ones that are producing gold from their mines, rather than pure exploration co.s. The juniors were hammered in the last year and there is plenty of time to pick a couple that will benefit from the rising gold prices.<br>  <br>  I'm in Minera Andes (MNEAF).

BoAEgaAGaa	The bill would extend the tax credits for improvements to energy-efficient existing homes through 2010. Under current law, individuals are allowed a tax credit equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer for qualified energy efficiency improvements installed during the taxable year. This tax credit is capped at $50 for any advanced main air circulating fan, $150 for any qualified natural gas, propane, oil furnace or hot water boiler, and $300 for any item of energy-efficient building property. For 2009 and 2010, the bill would increase the amount of the tax credit to thirty percent (30%) of the amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer for qualified energy efficiency improvements during the taxable year. This could be windows, doors and other items that will be released in the near future.  The bill would also eliminate the property-by-property dollar caps on this tax credit and provide an aggregate $1,500 cap on all property qualifying for the credit. The bill would update the energy-efficiency standards of the property qualifying for the credit. <br>  <br>  Check out What's new for 2009 on the form 5695 I have linked below.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5<br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

VsaEOX9vaa	The bank will add in your credit card dept along with any other loans or debts and will assess it against your income and the amount of your home loan will be estimated taking into account your ability to pay.<br>  <br>  A bank will usually take the total amount of your credit card limit as your debt, not how much you've used of it. So, if you have a card limit of $30,000 but have only used up $1000 of it the bank will see it that your debt is $30,000, not the $1000. That's the downside. Banks won't usually decline you for a home loan just because you have a c/card. They work on your ability to pay your loan.<br>  <br>  If possible, try and pay off your card and destroy it!

If so, then there is definitely an issue here.<br>  <br>  In your shoes, I would go tomorrow and then ask about this - - - for example is this company policy? what other information do they pass on? explain that you are concerned that this has infringed the data protection act and then see what happens.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel re-assured then turn the job down and leave.<br>  <br>  However,<br>  1.  if this is a job you've obtained via the job centre because you've been signing on, you need to think carefully about whether you should accept/ reject.

I would politely explain to them that although you may understand why they want you to start bonding with other new starters, you don't feel giving out your personal contact details is the right way to do this, and ask them whether they feel they are acting within the requirements of the Data protection Act.  Also, if I were you I'd email your line manager/HR department saying that you do not give you permission to them releasing your personal details to any third party without your express permission.

E1ztfbg8aa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having.

Back to your question. Surveys do work.<br>  <br>  But it won't make you rich though. I earn about $100 to $150 a month. Not much, but since it is free and easy, it is a great side income in the bad economy.<br>  <br>  I can recommend the one that I use below. No credit cards involved. Actually, all the legit ones never ask us to pay or buy anything. So if you come across one that does ask, avoid it.<br>  <br>  The website below actually contains a list of survey websites. The surveys are all placed into sections according to countries, so we can find the ones we qualify for easier. Hope it is what you are looking for.
4Jy8Hioiaa	Dear Mommyme & hubby,<br>  <br>       You have made a very wise choice to get out of debt. Credit cards are the worst, aren't they? I guess transferring the debt to a 0% card has some merit. I am personally a fan of the debt snowball approach. Before you start the debt snowball, save $1000 as a mini emergency fund right now. If you have a blown tire on the car, at least you have some cash to pay for it instead of putting it on a credit card and going further into debt.<br>  My wife and I are in the process of getting totally out of debt right now. This is car payments, credit cards, Home Equity, everything. The debt snowball goes like this. List all of your debts on a piece of paper largest to smallest. Now write the minimum payments next to all of them and the balances. Pay the minimum on all but the smallest debt. Now, throw every dime you can find in the car and sofa cushions at the smallest debt. Once the smallest is paid off, move up the list one step. Now pay the minimum on all the larger ones and throw every dime at the smallest on the list. If you have already paid off #1 (smallest) on the list, you should have a few extra bucks to throw at the next one (#2 on the list). Once that is done, take the money you would have applied to the two that are paid off, apply it to #3 on the list and throw all extra money at that one. As you can see, you keep throwing more and more money at each debt as you go up the list. That is why they call it the debt snowball. Because the amount you pay towards particular debts keeps getting larger and larger as you pay off and get rid of the credit cards. Yes, I said get rid of the credit cards. My wife and I have not used a credit card in a long time. It is not easy. You have to stay focused on your goal of being debt free. It takes some changes as well. You have to change your habits so you don't land up in the same spot. I can not even tell you the last time my wife and I went out to eat or to a movie.  Our new favorite word is "NO". Our friends think we have turned into hermits or something. That's ok though. We are getting our live back in order by paying off our debt. In fact, just yesterday, we received the title for our last paid off car in the mail. It is awesome to have no car payments anymore.  This gives us @ $800 a month to roll up into our next largest debt every month. I know that mathematically, it is best to throw all you can at the highest interest rate debt. That is usually the largest debt most of us have. It is better to pay off some of the smaller ones and feel like you are making progress as they drop off your list in my opinion. If the debts do not come off, people get the feeilng that they are getting nowhere and quit. Yeah, you can do some advanced calculus to figure the most efficient way to pay off debt, but I feel that seeing the debts drop off the sheet and the list getting shorter is much more motivating.<br>       Now, I did not dream up this idea as much as I would like to take credit for it. This comes from a gentlemen by the name of Dave Ramsey. If you are really serious about getting out of debt, please pick up a copy of his book The Total Money Makeover. This book will change the way you look at debt and personal finance. It is a very easy read and the principals are not hard. It is stuff you grandmother use to tell you. You must also have your hubby read is as well. It is always easier to fight a battle with allies. You can also go to his web site @ www.daveramsey.com. He has a great video about 24 min. long that you should watch. I can not recommend this program highly enough.<br>     I wish all the best to you and hubby in your new quest.

Discover usually charges a rate of 21.99% interest, which is the worst I've seen in a while.<br>  <br>  If you are going to apply for the Discover, only transfer over what you can pay off in the 0% interest time period. You will only save a few hundred dollars doing this just by saving the 17 or so interest the other card was charging you. If you can essentially "pay off" the other cards (a bunch of small balances) by transferring over to the Discover then only have one bill a month, then go for it, but you will really have to dig in and pay all you can on the Discover balance each month to pay it off before the 0% period is up.<br>  <br>  Back to your original question...when paying down credit, always pay the highest interest rate off first. Some people pay off the lowest balance first so they can have a sense of accomplishment and build off of it.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, read the terms of agreement on the Discover to be sure you're not going to get hit with a big interest amount when the 0% is up.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would check out Dave Ramsey's plan for "debt snowball" and "baby steps". It truly is the way to financial peace. Email me if you need some more info.|`|5056cf8298fd4e01add3c6905c181e17aa	First of all, quit adding to the credit card debt.  You should always pay the card that has the highest rate.  If you transfer to the 0% APR card there will be a transfer fee.  I just paid off $17,000 in credit card debt and my last payment was in November.  It took me about 42 months to pay if off.  Thank Goodness because all of my cards are now at 23.99% APR and I was paying all of my bills on time and a lot more than the minimum payment.  You two, need to sit down and cut down on expenses and make do on what you have.  If you don't then you will always have credit card debt.  Good Luck

zIfo91Gwaa	LOL (: Well if you lost your wallet...<br>  Check your immediate surroundings. Survey the room or rooms where the item might be. Don't go into depth, searching under piles of clothes and inside pants' pockets. Instead, just look around to see if the item is in plain sight. <br>  Look for the missing object where it is supposed to be, or where it can usually be found. If you lost your check card, then you should obviously check your wallet. If your keys are missing, then look in your door and car locks to make sure you didn't simply forget them. <br>  Check on your person. It sounds silly, but it's possible to forget that your glasses are already hanging around your neck, perched on your head, or even right in front of your eyes. Check these obvious spots once more even if you're sure you already did. <br>  Search for the missing object in depth. Now that you know the object is not in plain view, look in more detail around your home and car. If you have a messy residence, this may require some time. Make sure to be thorough. Most people have the same daily routine, which will narrow things down a bit. Eliminate places that the item is very unlikely to be (such as keys in the oven) to save time. You probably thought of several possible places, gave a cursory check of the first few, and by the time you got to the end of your list were getting worried and looking more carefully. Go back and look carefully in those more likely places too. <br>  Clean your surroundings. Try doing a rigorous tidy-up of your room, house, apartment, dorm room, car, book bag, backpack, purse, or whatever area you have likely lost your item. Items seldom disappear from spotlessly neat areas. Just cleaning up may very well reveal the whereabouts of your lost item. If not, well, at least you cleaned up! <br>  Think back to the last time and place you used the missing object. Did you take it to work or to a friend's house? Were you recently at a restaurant or on the city bus? When did you use the object last? Retracing your steps may lead to the object. These things usually happen when we are on auto-pilot and get distracted. Maybe someone was cleaning up and moved your item. Where might they have put it? <br>  Call the people and places you've been recently. Now that you have narrowed down the places it could be, call your friends, your job, the bus station, etc. They may be holding your missing object for you. <br>  Ask others to help you look for it Enlisting the help of others will often enhance your chances of spotting the lost item. This could be your family members, your friends, the bus driver, even total strangers (who are often remarkably obliging in looking for a misplaced item!). You can even put an advertisement in the local newspaper, on lampposts or on Craig's List--it's a long shot but may be worth it if your lost object is valuable. <br>  Search systematically Depending on your surroundings, try to come up with a system to avoid overlooking an area. For instance, if you think you may have lost your lucky penny in a grassy lawn, you may want to create a search pattern by yourself or with volunteers to avoid overlooking an area. <br>  Consider the possibility that the item may have been stolen. Do not panic, but consider how much the item might be worth to a stranger and whether anyone might want it as their own. If the item is relatively valueless, of course, it's unlikely to be an object of theft. However, you never know--people sometimes steal things for apparently nonsensical reasons. <br>  Give it time. Sometimes an item will surface in time. Your sister finds it while vacuuming in an oddball spot you never would thought of, for instance. Unless it is something which can cause serious problems (like credit cards, cell phone, checkbook, I.D.), sometimes just waiting pays off. <br>  Make sure the missing item doesn't get lost again, whether it is found or you replace it. Whether the item is replaced or found, get a better key chain (and use it for its purpose), organize your home, and have a designated place to store your valuables until the next time you need them. <br>  Do not look blindly for the item. The first reaction is to search for the missing item everywhere imaginable, leading to frustration. Take a moment to calm down and think logically. Be methodical and split the area up in smaller zones and scan one at a time. If you go back, always search the area as you've earlier defined. <br>  On at least one search pass, look above eye-level. So often, we're looking down while searching, but might have put the item on a higher shelf, "just for a moment." <br>  Check everything again and again. If you have searched your room for your keys three times, check again. It is not rare to find something in the very place you thought you had already searched thoroughly. Ask someone else to help you if you don't mind them looking through your things. <br>  Don't forget the automobile! For most people, the last place they were before coming home was in their car. For small objects (such as|`|pEztJVlbaa	u left it in my car..

There are only a few openings for people who are VERY trusted by their employers to work at home in this field and NEVER are those opportunities advertised on the web!|`|3mAgM405aa	Online medical billing and coding schools are very suspect when it comes to training on the latest medical/billing software since most medical centers have very customized medical software which is not normally shared with trade schools and the like. In the real world of medical billing and coding, training occurs on-the-job. We therefore do not recommend that you subscribe to any online school for medical billing and coding and concentrate on entering a medical internship program at your local medical facility/center for medical billing/coding.<br>  <br>  On another subject: the major bulk of medical billing/coding work in the U.S. has been greatly curtailed by state privacy laws as it pertains to medical records and patient confidentiality. The vast majority of medical records are kept in recordkeeping departments within medical centers and any billing/coding work is done "in-house," not "outsourced." So, beware of any offers which promote online in home medical billing/coding work--there are scammers out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

The international rules, for instance, make it easier for financial institutions to avoid detailing their market assets compared with the U.S. standards. In addition, technology companies often are able to report higher earnings overseas than in the United States because of the differences in treatment of intangible assets known as goodwill.<br>  <br>  Overall, companies that file under the international system have 6 to 7 percent higher earnings than they do when they report under U.S. standards. This can allow the firms to appear healthier than they really are.

The whole point is that you sell other peoples programs online and they pay you, much of which is what people are advertising in your comments, the ones that lead you to those "Make money EASY" sites, click on a few and you will see they look like scams, and most the time they are. But you can be selling peoples programs with affiliate marketing and making the money off of the stupid people who buy them, most of the products in affiliate marketing marketplaces are fake or just stupid programs. I have created a site for unlimited movie downloads which comes with an amazing program but you can sell it and earn 75% of $33.95 so basically $24.50 a sale, remember you are promoting my product so that is why i'm telling you this but its rather easy, I've personally sold two myself and made 60 bucks in two days here's a video over it if your interested <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GjhNAK4gjw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GjhNAK4g...</a> have fun bro!|`|w6hDh3jJaa	Making money online is really simple.

Your hobby loss of $680 is only one of the things that counts.  You can also itemize the mortgage interest and property taxes on your house, state and local income taxes, charitable donations, etc.<br>  <br>  Another thing that I wonder about in reading your write-up is whether you calculated your business/hobby income correctly.  You say that you loss because of all of the equipment you buy.  You should not be deducting the cost of the equipment all in the year of purchase.  You need to depreciate things that have a life over a year, over a period that is usually 5 or 7 years.  If you have done that, you might not actually have a loss since you should only be deducting 1/5 or 1/7th of what something costs each year.|`|eojDX3itaa	You are not considered self-employed since you are treating<br>  your income as hobby income.

AA11573642	The ABA Definition of Legal Assistant/Paralegal is "A legal assistant or paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible"<br>  Generally paralegals who work for large law firms or in large metropolitan areas earn more .Career opportunities are excellent.<br>  The average salary of a paralegal is about $44000.|`|3mAgM405aa	The opportunities for a paralegal really depends on the specialty. The most in demand paralegals are those in the litigation field; followed by corporate paralegals who are responsible for maintaining corporate records, articles of incorporation, etc. While the "least" marketable [but the "highest" paid] paralegals are in the field of intellectual property [i.e., patents, trademarks] and immigration law. In conclusion, choose your paralegal courses accordingly, with emphasis on litigation preparation [discovery], docketing/calendaring of incoming pleadings [calendaring] and trial preparation [creating Exhibit tabs, Bajii jury instructions, etc.]. The "pro" side of a litigation paralegal is often "unlimited" overtime which can amount to a high salary range of $65,000 to $75,000 per year, while the "downside," being constantly pressured to meet a monthly client billable quota. And failing to meet that quota, often results in the paralegal's overnight dismissal. It's not a pretty picture. I just want to lay out what really happens in the real world of litigators and their relationship with subordinate paralegals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10305589	After graduating as a paralegal, you have the opportunity to apply for jobs as a paralegal.

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	If Obama and the Democrats get their National Health Care program through the Congress then doctors and others in the medical field could see their pay cut. If not, then it is likely to be an area where you can earn an above average income. Not all lawyers earn a high income. Many of those who are in the higher income brackets get their money by shaking down companies and individuals using the courts and legal system. If the Republicans are successful in getting tort reform through Congress then we could see their incomes brought more in line, You could see fewer lawsuits if this legislation is passed. That is not likely with most of Congress being lawyers. The American Bar Association is a major contributor to the Democrats and since they are currently the majority party that is not likely to pass or even get to the point of a vote.<br>  <br>  What is a high paying job today may or may not be so in a decade.

eojDX3itaa	Several things here: first, your rental income does not go on<br>  Schedule C, but Schedule E, unless you are real estate <br>  professional. Real estate rental activities are considered by<br>  the IRS to be "passive activities" and thus are not subject to <br>  SE tax (which would not be the case of activities reported on<br>  Sch C-these are subject to SE tax).<br>  Your investment is at risk if the assets are yours and you don't <br>  have nonrecourse financing (which is does not sound like you<br>  have).

yO5tm6e1aa	I was you a couple of decades ago.  Thought just like you too.  It's a lofty goal.  You're going to quickly discover home ownership comes with a host of other costs which will utilize your disposable income.  Here are some examples:<br>  <br>  -- Interest (instead of making interest on your savings, you're now paying a bank interest charges for lending you the money).<br>  -- Property Taxes<br>  -- HOA fees (you did say Condo)<br>  -- Utilities (except for trash collection which your Condo HOA fees will cover).<br>  <br>  If you still think you have enough extra money to pay down Principal over 60 months... then you haven't a woman in your life.  And, trust me on this, when you own your own place a woman will find a way to your heart... and then take over your dwelling.  And, when this happens, you won't have ANY money left over to pay more than the regularly scheduled mortgage payments (i.e. over 30 years).<br>  <br>  Edit:  Did some calculations for you....<br>  For a 70K place with 20% down, you have a 56K loan.  You can get a 5% 30 year fixed rate in todays market.  To pay that loan off in 5 years (60 months), you'll need to pay $1056.79 per month in P&I.  This is 42% of your gross income.  You'll need $700 a year in property taxes (i.e. $58.33 / month) and the HOA fees.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Zeltar really has nailed a lot of issues you haven't even been able to see.  Paying off a home at 24 yrs old doesn't make a lot of sense.  Being house poor at your age makes no sense as this won't be the last home in your life.  At your age, many things could change in a heartbeat and you could be moving at any time given changes in your marital status and the possibility of a family.  Your condo wouldn't support a family trust me.  Put the condo on a longer mortgage, take advantage of equity as needed and be able to re-sell at a great price when needed.  A much more adult approach to home buying.|`|7ab5cfb44c01bb054a6a928a94becb65aa	You'll always have to pay:<br>  1) Property tax<br>  2) Condo fees<br>  3) Home owners insurance (if not covered in above fees)<br>  4) Utilities.<br>  <br>  The only difference is you'll have one less payment (mortgage).<br>  <br>  However, what I'd suggest doing with all that extra money is saving it so you can get out of whatever city you live in that has a 60k condo and a 30k/yr job.<br>  <br>  Try out a real city.

QoVL5cDHaa	BR is not an emergency tax code. For 2006/2007, emergency code would be 503L, on a week or month 1 basis, personal allowance ￡5035.<br>  If your P45 when you left job showed emergency code, Jobcentre wouldn't have done refund.  As you started job right at the beginning of the tax year, employer shouldn't have put you on an emergency code, but on an cumulative basis. Your form P60U received from Jobcentre at end of tax year would show whether or not refund made.<br>  You can always contact tax office, and ask for 2006/2007 to be reviewed. You may have unused tax allowance, as Jobseekers is below taxable limit. Tax office will want to know your employment/Jobseekers history for the year. They may also need form  P45 from job, as well as P60U. You should have retained copy of P45/1A.<br>  The L suffix is not of much significance  to employees now. It used to differentiate between married men (suffix H) and married women and single people (suffix L). The only reason code numbers have a suffix is to tell employers how much to budget-uprate code numbers each year. It saves HMRC having to send out individual notices.<br>  I assume you didn't have any pay from job for your first five days there, 1st April to 5th April 2006.

pt6wIlS1aa	Yes, work through a temp agency counts. Your reason for losing your job is a normal one for getting unemployment.<br>  <br>  In your case, the one thing that may keep you from getting unemployment is not having earned enough money to qualify financially. If you never worked before the 3 1/2 months, you may not qualify, because they base the amount you'd get on a couple quarters (3 month periods).<br>  <br>  Apply anyway and let the state determine whether you're eligible or not.<br>  <br>  Regarding what the answerer above said, it doesn't matter whether you were let go by the client company or the temp agency. If the client company let you go and the temp agency didn't place you in another job, you're unemployed.|`|r9nxFkGtaa	Did the temp agency lay you off or the company you were assigned to?  In order to qualify for unemployment, you need to have been terminated from the temp agency.  Otherwise, they can just assign you to another company.

aLZKicieaa	Here are the rules for dependent:<br>  <br>  1. Relationship - He's your son,so you get a check for this.<br>  2. Age - Less than 24 and a a full time student for at least 5 calendar months. --- CHECK<br>  3. Residency - Did he stay with you at least 6 months of the year? If he was in a dorm, IRS includes it as if he was living at home, called temporary absence. So, if yes, then Check.<br>  4. Support - You, as the parent must have provided more than half of his support. If you paid for all his food, shelter, clothing, then you get a check.<br>  <br>  Remember, even if he earned 21k, you don't count the whole 21k unless he spent it all. <br>  <br>  How much did he really spend for himself and you provided for support? To figure if you provided more than half of a person's support, you must first determine the total support provided for that person. Total support includes amounts spent to provide food, lodging, clothing, education, medical and dental care, recreation, transportation, and similar necessities.<br>  <br>  Generally, the amount of an item of support is the amount of the expense incurred in providing that item. For lodging, the amount of support is the fair rental value of the lodging.<br>  <br>  Expenses that are not directly related to any one member of a household, such as the cost of food for the household, must be divided among the members of the household.<br>  <br>  Also, if he received any scholarship, it does not count as part of his support. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The short answer, doubtful.<br>  <br>  Use IRS pub 501, page 20 and do the math.  Either  you supported him or you didn't.  This is the same test the IRS uses in the event of an audit, so if you are claiming him, keep copies of all receipts.

If I am reading this correctly, you make $526 a month and your total bills and expenses are $300. <br>  <br>  How I got that number: 500 a semester times four semesters a year equals $2000 a year for college. Add $160 for tuition (40 x 4). That equals $2160. Divide that by twelve months and you get $180. Add that amount to your "expenses" of $120 a month and you get $300 a month in expenses even though you pay some of them quarterly.<br>  <br>  So in theory, you should be saving $226 every month. If I were you I would open a savings account and deposit at least $150 a month into savings. The best time to do it is when you get paid so you never really miss it. You can split it between checks if you need to, such as, if you get paid once a week, deposit about 40 a week, or if you get paid twice a month, deposit 75 each time. Deposit the remaining $76 into your bank account for unplanned expenses.<br>  <br>  Back to the allowance...everyone needs some spending money, if you constantly deprive yourself of little endulgences, you might end up splurging on some spontanious unneeded item. Treat yourself to some ice cream, Starbucks, or a book (whatever) with the $10 you get as an allowance. <br>  <br>  So to come up with a suitable "budget" you need to save $300 of what you make a month, plus the $150 you are to put into savings. The best way to track this is with a spreadsheet, which you can find plenty of online, I attached a good website for help finding one. For your situation, I would recommend an "Envelope" budget.<br>  <br>  It's always the problem with starting a good budget is that it isn't a perfect world and your college fees (books, tuition, ect..) may come up before you have saved enough in that section of the budget. Which brings me to the bank account. The $630 you currently have is there to cover your expenses till you get your budget in order. I wouldn't touch it if it isn't a emergency. Only if you can't cover things in the near future.<br>  <br>  You seem pretty smart from your question, I think you got it. Email me through yahoo if you need some help with it.|`|skz3EqUXaa	The only thing better than investing in the market ...  is investing in yourself.<br>  <br>  Average return for stocks since 1850 = 10.2% per year<br>  <br>  But the return on college and graduate school for you would<br>  be much higher.

XAesYVU9aa	Covered interest rate parity means that the relationship between spot and forward foreign exchange rate is determined by the domestic and foreign interest rates.

Few people dispute covered interest rate parity.<br>  <br>  Uncovered interest rate parity postulates that the future spot FX rate will be equal to the forward rate implied by covered interest rate parity. There is NO arbitrage to make this hold. It is an economic equilibrium argument that many dispute.

9m96dsZIaa	I'm assuming you mean a 10% tax credit, not 1%? If the government implements a 10% tax credit, then the DEMAND for investment will rise. Firms will borrow money to invest in captial equipment, which in turn makes the real interest rate RISE. In other words, as the SUPPLY of loanable funds from banks is reduced, the price (interest rate) rises.<br>  <br>  National savings and investment are really the same thing. Investment is just part of the Y = C + I + G  equation that is not spent (therefore invested). So national savings = investment. By definition, that will rise since we're assuming the demand for investment will rise (because it is now cheaper due to the tax credit).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck with the class!

Ns6I7MmBaa	Nobody knows what future tax rates will be.  While they may be lower for your current income, a dollar will be worth less (inflation), so you will need more dollars to maintain the same standard of living, which may end up in same or higher tax bracket.<br>  <br>  I am only 10 years from retirement (hopefully) and I figure that I will need as much income as my net pay now plus social security to live the same lifestyle.<br>  <br>  General thought when you are young is to contribute at least enough to get company match for a 401k (if eligible), max out your Roth IRA, and if you have more contribute more to 401k.  As you get older and tax rate higher, contribute more to 401k or IRA to keep taxable income under next tax bracket.  An IRA/Roth IRA mix should result in less retirement tax than if all your savings was tax deferred, and the Roth also gives you flexibility for nontaxable withdrawals.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	You do not know.

5zQbG8TDaa	Its just more mentoring.
211Wwh6Laa	OK...I've seen that stupid SMC scam used for an answer on the last three questions I've looked at!  Ugh!<br>  <br>  Being professional is not always easy, but it's not impossible.  One of the first steps would be to know the company you are planning to apply for.  This will help you choose the type of clothing you will need.  For instance, some offices have a strict dress code of slacks or skirts that fall to a certain length, blouses, jackets, etc...while many are more casual and allow crisp looking jeans or slacks, sweaters, or colorful blouses...and I've worked in a company that allowed their receptionist and HR staff to wear jeans and tee-shirts, so long as they were clean, not worn out, and bore no profanity.  By walking into your interview with the appropriate attire (not over dressed or under dressed), you are communicating that you have taken the time to learn about the company, which will be a step in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Next, handle yourself with poise.  You can quickly gauge your surroundings and follow suit.  Some companies have an open policy where the staff can chit chat between working periods, while others expect nothing outside of work topics to go on outside the breakroom (though I rarely see these types of companies anymore).  If the staff seems laid back and casual, you should try to be the same without going overboard.  Of course, gossip happens, but try to hold yourself at a higher standard and don't get in on it.<br>  <br>  Be confident, and let it show.  It may be a bit intimidating at first, to be around a lot of professional people, but the truth is, most of them are just like you...they can "let their hair down" outside of the office.<br>  <br>  Be prompt.  Be courteous.  Use respectful language (no cursing, using racially charged words or actions, etc.).<br>  <br>  I'm going to give you the link I used for a college paper I wrote for one of my business classes on office place decorum.

59394a1b605823a8a42f1427df951f78aa	My first suggestion would be to talk with your boss(es).<br>  <br>  Tell them that you've been offered another position and ask them if the business is in a place where you may begin that position immediately or if they would prefer that you still provide the final two weeks.<br>  <br>  If they say that you are free to go, then you are free to go.  If they ask that you give them the two weeks to find a replacement, then I would suggest doing that.  <br>  <br>  Operating in this kind of a fashion shows your employer that you actually care about the company and that you're responsible.  To leave without communicating is not a responsible action and will definitely cost you in the long-run, especially if you intend to use your current employers as a reference.<br>  <br>  You never know - they may end up offering you more money to stay if they feel that you are exceptional at what you do.  Quite frankly, however, there is no way to know anything if you do not communicate.<br>  <br>  I've been in situations many times where you're at right now, and I can tell you that you are fully capable of handling two more weeks if you have to - especially if it allows you to leave on a good note.|`|gWlcDZJ6aa	2 weeks notice is more of a courtesy than anything. At my last job, my boss was a d*ck so i gave him 1 week's notice, even tho i didn't want to even give that much, but it was all right for the paycheck. There are probably ways around this, tho. Here in AZ, if you don't call in OR show up, you automatically lose your job, depending on how badly they need you. You could do that if you wanted to. Or just tell them, "i got offered a position at [place], and they need me to start by monday." Something like that. Or say that it's between you and another person and they're doing a first-come first-serve type of thing. OR even say they pay more and you want to start asap.

You never know when you will need your current boss to write a letter of recommendation for you down the road, or when you might end up working for the same company down the road (even if it is not the same location). You could talk with your boss about the situation, tell him/her that you have been offered another position and that they would like you to start as soon as possible. If you are not in a "necessity" type of position, your boss will probably say see ya to avoid paying you for those additional days. However, if you perform a job that is considered a "necessity" in the company, the boss may want to keep you on as long as possible until he/she can find a replacement to fill your position.<br>  <br>  You should give notice as soon as possible so that your employee can start looking for someone else to take over your job responsibilities.

That way you each owe half and are reliable for it should conflict arise.  I know she's your friend but, living w/ someone is different than just hanging out w/ them all the time.  Try to be pacient and talk through problems.<br>  <br>  Shop sale adds and plan your meals and stay away from junk.  That'll save you a lot of money.  Talk to your friend about taking one hour a week to sit down together and talk about expenses.  This way you can say we'll need to pay probably $25 or $50 each this month for the electric bill...so on.  Then you can also plan out your meals together and save money that way.

This gets everything into your name.  You can put it only in your name or jointly...up to you.  But,  it's REALLY expensive that first month.  Then it gets better.<br>  <br>  If you're buying furniture together that one is tricky.  I'd say you each agree on what the other will buy and then when you move out you take what you bought respectivly.  Please keep your reciepts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

1Mc6BOvKaa	Certainly do!<br>  <br>  The value for money you get is excellent. The service is lacking in some respects, but you get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  I just think the Government should be running it as a public service, rather than a state-owned corporation operating as if its a profit making company. I feel they should be subsidising it, or allowing Royal Mail to set their own prices. <br>  <br>  I also think that the Government has been stupid in allowing private companies to offer postal services. These companies don't have to offer a universal service order, like the Royal Mail, so can get away with dropping services that aren't profitable (unlike RM). This means that they leave all the rubbish to RM, and the Government still expects us to make a profit! Also note that whenever you get a letter which says "DHL" or "UKMail" etc, it means that these companies have taken the profit, but handed it to Royal Mail to deliver it for peanuts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, rant over!|`|5esm3e1Baa	Yep, the system is good value for money when it works, which it does most of the time.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately Royal Mail do need a kicp up the jacksie though, for not offering sufficient job security to employees, and employing too many casuals.<br>  <br>  They also need to repair my front gate which our postwoman pulled of its hinges.|`|vKlMdtpaaa	i think the royal mail does a great job. just a shame its virtually private owned but yep, for 30p you can send a letter to most places and their international rates ain't bad either. we got a very good delivery system that's why a lot of other firms want to get their hands on it!<br>  <br>  you put 30p worth of fuel in your car and see where it gets you! the royal mail have got it sussed! its took em a good 100 years to get it the way it is tho!|`|a39c08e2d528938562d0708be9d80e3caa	Yes, hats off to the postman.

Usually these transactions take much longer than credit card transactions on PayPal. PayPal gives you a clearing date, so that you will know when the funds will be available (unless some unexpected situation arises). If the clearing date is February 23, then you should have your funds then, and can't expect them to be there earlier. The fact that the weekend fell on the 21 and 22, probably is what helped to further delay the funds until the 23.

An agent will find YOU, if you have any marketable talent along with a local track record of success with your script-writing.<br>  <br>  What plays have you written that have been produced? What film scripts that you authored have been produced in your own country? How much money did they make?<br>  <br>  Hollywood is a business, not an artistic endeavor.

Pjm9pg7iaa	The best budget would be zero. Do not spend any money.  You don't know how well they are going to treat you. So wait to buy clothes until you have profits from the new job. Borrow clothes if you have to. No one will care. All that matters is your smile. Everyone who comes to a law firm has troubles in their own lives. They don't even look at you and won't remember you 2 minutes after they are gone. Not because you are not nice; but because their minds are full..|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Whether you are a lawyer, paralegal or secretary,  I would encourage you buy quality clothes.   The business model in many law firms is away from hiring a bunch of lawyers when there are experienced legal assistants who will process the paperwork and are not burdened with a large ego of some recent law grad.  An billionaire  industrialist of the 19th century was once asked what he would do if he only had $10 left.  His answer:  "buy a large Stetson hat."   I think you enjoy work and play more, if your clothes make you feel good.  To be candid, I think you can consider losing weight when you feel good about life.  Yes, I would run up some debt if required to look and feel like you want.   Good luck in your new job.

STYhiMEyaa	There are different types of accounting.  Karen mentions the traditional company accounts but there's also auditing and cost and management accounting.  Cost and management accounting gets you more involved in what's happening in the running of a business than just financial reporting.<br>  <br>  Many years ago I was a local government auditor.  I worked for the internal audit team and audited the authority's building and maintenance contracts.  It was interesting work, with site visits to check that work that we were being asked to pay for had been done.<br>  <br>  After that I became a cost and management accountant for a chemical company.  I was involved in setting budgets for the year as well as checking spend against them during the year.  I worked on how costs of products were made up and oversaw some of the stocktaking operations.  It was all very interesting and has stood me in good stead for running my own businesses.  And, yes, the pay is good!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your studies!|`|QNSlUvfGaa	Basically we analyse all accounts, from sole traders, limited companies through to public companies. Our job is to ensure that accurate accounting takes place and no fraud is involved. Whilst being with various different companies which is interesting, it is also a long involved boring job. But having said that I have done it for over 20 years so it cannot be all that bad.
AA10590885	I just canned an employee who said "somebody else should have done that".  I need an employee who looks at the big picture - if part of the team misses something - then the whole will fail.  I don't care if "someone" else dropped trash in the hall - it is the job of all to keep the work area up to standards. The "someone" else attitude in this case transferred into a code violation that would have resulted in fines if the error had not be caught in advance. If you could translate a willingness to be responsible for all that comes within your contact I would think you would be my replacement employee. I want the guy who helps old ladies cross the street and disabled motorists - he would probably have that same attitude towards all he encounters. Hope that helps.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	if you cant answer it spot on yourself dj paul is right you are not suitable for the position.<br>  try McDonald's.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	If you cant answer it yourself then you are not suitable for the possition
pOjKgvQPaa	That's a great question.  Many traders will be looking to go long at the November lows, so just keep in mind what you're up against.  If that support fails then the next support should be around the negative 23 retracement from the last sell off which would be in the 730s area, I don't have my charts up right now for an exact number.  If you were interested in shorting new lows, I would wait to see how those new lows are made, and then short the bounce back up.  It's safer that way.  In my own opinion.  But just keep in mind there will be heavy, aggressive buying in that area, and just below it, plus volatility should really kick through the roof.  Might be better off going with something softer like the SPY during such wild times.|`|ww12lItvaa	I recently heard somebody saying they think the low will come in July on that next leg down. <br>  <br>  As a trader or speculating as you want to do the trigger they were using was if it broke that Nov. low. Then they expect it to fall to the next support. Only hindsight will tell. <br>  <br>  BUT, I will say earnings keep coming in worst than expected.<br>  <br>  As an investor I only care if stocks are cheap or not. I don't care about getting the last 10% at the bottom or the last 10% at the top. I am happy with the 80% in the middle. (wink)<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

iZrMceyxaa	Data management requires regular reporting on backups, transaction logs, access controls and database retrieval speed. File reporting is used to monitor database working environment. Since organizations need to fulfill compliance requirements and also look into network security issues, they require regular reports on application performances.<br>  <br>  File reporting eliminates manual analysis and provides regular trend analysis too.

MmTe8W8uaa	You must file as single.  To file as head of household, you must pay for over half of the cost of keeping up the household.  Since you and your roommates are splitting this cost equally, your share is not more than 1/2 of the total, and you do not qualify as a head of household.<br>  <br>  Exception:  In certain cases, providing over half the cost of keeping up the household of one's parent(s) may be sufficient to qualify, even if one lives elsewhere.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Single.

S3lvnRwfaa	That's not a business card.  A business card has nothing but your contact details on it - name of the firm, line of business, your name, your phone, your e-mail address, web site URL, maybe a fax number.  If you were to fit all the text you have in mind onto a standard business card, it would be an illegible 6 points or so.<br>  <br>  What you have in mind is some kind of advertising flyer, probably A5 in size (or whatever the equivalent is if you're in the US).  That way you can use a legible type-face and even some graphics to make it eye-catching and informative.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you approach a graphic designer or marketing consultant.  One successful new lead will cover the costs involved, so it's more than worth it!

WJjfrf0Caa	it depends on how much you made.<br>  <br>  A 1099 form is given when you are not an employee. this means that you are an independent contractor. This means you will have to pay double social security tax and double medicaid tax. Another name for the double tax is self-employment tax. when you are an employee, your company pays half of your social security and medicaid. When you get a 1099 you have to pay the whole thing yourself. <br>  <br>  What worries me is that it doesn't sound like you knew you were going to get a 1099 form. The major problem depends on how much money you have made. This is because you have been paid already and NO taxes were taken out. This means that you are now responsible for ALL of the taxes NOW. So if you make $10,000, then you have to pay about 11% income tax and then about 9% for social security and medicaid. So that's 20%. This means that you will have to come up with $2,000 to pay off your taxes.<br>  <br>  I'm worried about you because if you weren't planning on getting a 1099 then you probably weren't saving $2000 just for taxes. you really really need to get an accountant for this. It will cost less than $100 for an accountant and they will make sure that you only pay what you need to pay.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	If he is legally giving you a 1099, then you are a self-employed independent contractor will be required to pay a "self-employment tax", which is essentially the social security and mediCARE taxes.  (There is no "mediCAID" tax, so I assume you meant medicare.)<br>  <br>  If you are an employee, not a self-employed independent contractor, then it is illegal for him to give you the 1099, he is required to pay the social security and medicare taxes, and you are not required to pay the "self-employment tax".|`|tLxGkkVsaa	This is your bosses way out of getting to pay social security and medicare taxes.  There is no federal or state taxes taken out.  Your boss does not have to pay for workmen's compensation.  The Misc 1099 is for cheapskates.  Your only hope is that  you have deductions, such as mileage, supplies, tools, etc.  You need help doing your taxes.  Self employment will automatically  be taken out when doing your taxes.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	According to you he's your boss.  According to him, he's not.<br>  <br>  A 1099-Misc means he wants you to take on all burdens of taxes.  You have to pay 15.3% instead of just your half.  You also have to ensure you send in quarterly estimated taxes, buy your own insurance and save for sick days and layoffs.

4RjM5lElaa	I've been on both sides - making the call to check a reference and getting called.<br>  <br>  When I make the call the questions are very basic - and this is for legal reasons.  How long have you known the applicant?  If it was someone at their last job:  How long did they work there?  and Are they re-hirable?<br>  <br>  If I am called and it's a personal reference, the questions are generally the same - maybe opinions are asked more, so:  How long have you known them?  How did you meet?  What do you think of them for this job?  What three words would you use to describe them?<br>  <br>  Either way, a business or professional reference, NEVER let your reference be surprised - always ask if you can list them as a reference.  When they say yes, keep them informed each time you list them - telling them that you applied to XYZ company and the job is __________ and you listed them as a reference.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	They did call me.<br>  <br>  The woman sounded completely bored.

wECa3wmVaa	If you have worked with any people in the past, talk with them about referring people they know.  Referrals from satisfied customers is a great way to market your goods or services.  You can place ads online for free such as on craigslist.com for your local area (and similar services such as kijiji and backpage).  There is always your local newspaper or if you have a welcome wagon service (for new people in the area) you can offer to put a flyer in their packets to attract people moving in to the area that will want painting done.  Remember to put a sign out when you are working that also advertises in the neighborhood.
211Wwh6Laa	You can't.  If the application asks for a cover letter and resume to be copied and pasted, then that is what they want...<br>  <br>  If you have a scanner, you can scan the letters of recommendation and then copy and paste them...but only AFTER you have done this with the cover letter and resume.  If the rules aren't followed, the person going over the application will automatically delete it, even if the pope himself sent a glowing letter of recommendation!  The rules are there for a reason:  and part of that reason is to be sure that those who are applying can follow the rules.  And, a letter of recommendation has to have the original letterhead of the previous companies, so you can't go typing it up yourself.<br>  <br>  You can easily create a resume in word if you know how it's done.  The same can be done for cover letters.  Go to google, type in "free hospital resume templates" and it should give you a list of accepted templates to use for resumes for hospitals.  Do the same thing for the cover letter.<br>  <br>  If he filled out the paper application fully, you should have the information you need to create the resume.  Name, address, contact numbers and email (if he has a professional looking email address), education history and employment history, accomplishments, awards, etc...are all information you can find on the application.  If you stumble into trouble, ask your dad to help you clarify things.|`|4lheF4iIaa	You need to scan them. If you don't have a scanner, you can take them to Kinkos or similar store and they can scan them and send them to you as an email attachment.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	You would have to show me what you are talking about.|`|51dff71b1a9e764ae4aa42218cfb19d3aa	Available upon request (?)|`|vnJG8UYJaa	You would not type them in, you would scan them in and then upload them.  <br>  <br>  Why are you doing this for your father?  If he is not computer literate, start teaching him!  Everyone needs to be a little familiar with computers with any type of work these days.<br>  <br>  Next, you need to stop and type up a short resume.  Use the information from the application to type one up in Microsoft Word.  There is help in the Wizard section and there are resume templates that make it very easy to use.  Then you will have to type up a cover letter to whoever you are applying to.  Just simply state that you are interested in "name the job."  Tell them how you can be contacted.  State that you are enclosing letters of reference and that you look forward to hearing from them.  A lot of companies will not consider you if they ask for a resume and cover letter and they don't get one.  The fact that they want the application on line is an indication that they expect your dad to be slightly familiar with a computer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

I am attaching a link to the IRS for form 1040X and the instructions if you are able to fill these out yourself.  <br>  <br>  The bad news is it takes the IRS 8 to 12 weeks to accept an amended tax return, and only then will the ex be able to claim the child.  Here is a phone number to the IRS to check on the status of an amended tax return, so you will possibly be able to know before they actually send you a letter stating they have accepted the return.  1-800-829-0582<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	he can still file - he just has to mail his return in through the post rather  than e-file.|`|UteGyKWDaa	I would contact HR Block and get their help in resolving this issue.

Good Luck!|`|AA11132354	Generally the IRS will ONLY reject another's return because some one claimed the child already for the same purpose--dependency, EIC.  You are entitled to EIC for the child (But NOT EX), but not to the dependency exemption, assuming the child lived with you and you were signed 8332 for Ex to take the child's dependency exemption.  Happens ALL the time and does NOT cause the other person's tax return to be rejected.  Seems you may NOT have fully understood the questions and have made a mistake in filing.  Look on the front, does it show both your sons as exemptions?  Or is one listed as nondependent.  Or is your EX wrongly claiming EIC for a child who is NOT living with him???<br>  Suggest you have a tax professional look at your return and see what you did.  Hubby will HAVE to file a paper return and you MAY have to file an amended return.|`|zPPYGv7Daa	Unfortunately, you can't fix since you already efiled it.

jOu4dtUiaa	I am a store manager and there is nothing that makes me any angrier than a cashier talking on the phone while waiting on a customer.  I always train my employees to say hello to the customer and smile and ask if they found everything ok but to avoid chitchat unless the customer wants to chat. A SMILE is EVERYTHING! About M word though,I think people are just taught that it is the polite thing to say but I am with you there too and I hate it. But I would also hate to hear someone say HEY YOU! so I dont know what the answer is to that one. I was in a shoe store once and the cashier was on the phone while waiting on me and I just got mad and left with the shoes still on the counter. definitely #1 irritant for me. On the flip side though... customers come to the counter talking on their cell phones and that is extremely rude too.|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	My biggest pet peeve is the cashiers (cough, Walmart) who bag grocery items with things that are not grocery items. I've had them bag donuts with Windshield Wiper Fluid, canned compressed air for cleaning keyboards and shampoo with chips, and stuff like that, it really annoys me because something could either a) crush the grocery items or b) leak all over the grocery items. I spend a lot of time re-bagging stuff at Walmart, all though Vons is getting worse as well. They are awful at bagging breakable items, putting multiple bottles of wine in the same bag so they clank together and then not double bagging them, the same with gallon glass jars of apple juice. They also are great at squishing donuts with wine bottles in the same bag. Annoys the heck out of me, and makes me never want to go back, however, it seems like every store is becoming that way, so I just go with the flow and re-bag the items before they leave the store. <br>  <br>  The other big pet peeve is when the cashiers claim to be an "expert" on things and they really have no idea what they are talking about (cough, Vons). They had a gas card promotion, our gas card did not work, and they said this has never happened before, even though headquarters told us it happens all the time and the cashier insisted it was our mistake and never wanted to try to help us and we had to go thru headquarters. They will also insist that when we have a probelm (like ice cream bars we were buying were melted and refrozen in their freezers) and talk to a manager, and then go to them they will say "the manager didn't say that" or "the manager didn't do that" causing all sorts of headaches and making us have to go fetch the manager and bring him/her over to deal with it. <br>  <br>  Finally, employees who don't know where items are and insist on showing you where they are (cough, Target). We asked if they carried binoculars as we had checked in many different departments. They said yes, let me show you where they are, and took us all in circles, never found them, called another employee who went in circles and said we don't carry them anymore I guess. Well if you weren't sure you carried them in the first place, don't pretend that you do. Also, this happens all the time at stores, they will say it's down this isle, only to find out it's not there, they spend forever looking for it, never find it, they finally admit they either are out of stock or don't carry it. <br>  <br>  Also lying employees who say they "restock nightly" when it is obvious they don't, only to hear from managers that they restock once a week. <br>  <br>  UGH customer service is DEAD in the water in this country!|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	talk on the phone and tell me "Just a min" while I am waiting to pay for my items.|`|5AAY41ROaa	well, there is a gas station in my town that i no longer got to even thought its on my way to school and work. <br>  <br>  the lazy cashiers are usually out side smoking even though your waiting at the register with your stuff. and when they are at the register they are either texting or talking on their phone or to each other sometimes completely ignoring you. its very aggravating and there not like in there 20s there probably in there mid 40s  there all women and they should probably be fired. they should really know better.|`|dip4oxB5aa	an endless list of  stupid stuff.  most recently I bought a drink. the drink was priced at .99 on the bottle but the price listed on the shelf was on sale for .79 with a big sign.  it was a battle that i lost to avoid the stress on my life.  i dont shop there anymore.  another idiot avoided that costed me .20 which is much cheaper than a heart attack from stress.|`|KaswQNUnaa	When I'm buying clothes & they just wad them up and throw them in the bag. >:|
MmTe8W8uaa	1. The maximum amount of unemployment compensation that anyone can receive in California is $450 per week.  If you qualify for unemployment compensation in California, you will probably receive at least $442 per week.  You might qualify for the full $450 depending on whether you made exactly $11,500 each quarter or made more some quarters and less other quarters.  The general rule is that your benefit is either the maximum or 1/2 of what you made, whichever is less.  There are exceptions.  For the exact values, they do not use a formula.  They use a table.  It is in the PDF file at <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de1275a.pdf," rel="nofollow">http://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de1275...</a> near page 10.<br>  <br>  2. "You may be able to work part time and receive reduced UI<br>  benefits, even if your earnings are higher than your weekly<br>  benefit amount. You report your total earnings before deductions<br>  and EDD will figure the amount to deduct." "If your weekly earnings are $100 or less, EDD does not count the first $25. The amount of earnings over $25 is subtracted from your weekly benefit amount and you are paid the difference, if any."  "If your weekly earnings are $101 or more, EDD does not count the first 25 percent of your earnings.

Bb09NSzSaa	Offshore banks are not illegal....they are perfectly legal. It isn't like it used to be though, most "offshore" banks don't give the advantages that they used to.<br>  <br>  Offshore banking has often been associated with the underground economy and organized crime, via tax evasion and money laundering; however, legally, offshore banking does not prevent assets from being subject to personal income tax on interest. Except for certain persons who meet fairly complex requirements, the personal income tax of many countries makes no distinction between interest earned in local banks and those earned abroad. Persons subject to US income tax, for example, are required to declare on penalty of perjury, any offshore bank accounts—which may or may not be numbered bank accounts—they may have. Although offshore banks may decide not to report income to other tax authorities, and have no legal obligation to do so as they are protected by bank secrecy, this does not make the non-declaration of the income by the tax-payer or the evasion of the tax on that income legal. Basically what this is saying is that not all offshore banks will report your income to the IRS, but it is up to you to do it, if you don't, it is tax evasion.<br>  <br>  When you bank in the U.S., you can be secure in the knowledge that your money is insured by the government. No such guarantees exist with offshore banks. In other words, a country could have a coup or a natural disaster or an accounting scandal one day and all the money could be gone the next. Furthermore, you could find yourself scammed; it does happen. Remember, this is a business built on skirting the law, so you won’t always deal with the most honest people (but that varies by country).|`|2TXXD1vKaa	illegal.. bad idea!

If you don't own (free and clear) something of much greater value.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can think of is to have a co-signer such as a parent or someone that trusts you as such. Essentially they will be placing something they own as collateral or using their credit score to get you the loan.

PayPal does have age requirements to open an account however. I would recommend that you go to Walmart or a 7-11 and purchase a pre-paid VISA card. You can use them just about anywhere that VISA is accepted, and they can be recharged in stores, by phone, or on the Internet.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	yes, your parents can do that, or ask them to buy you one of those prepaid credit cards that has the money on it that they put on it.

Bb09NSzSaa	How much? If it is a couple hundred bucks, then I don't see why fight it if you can definitely write it off as forever paid.  <br>  <br>  If it is more then I would call them and ask for their justification on sending a 13 year old bill. As a matter of fact, I would call them even if it is a couple dollars to see what the deal is.<br>  <br>  When you settled your original debt with them, did they issue you a letter stating that your balance was zero. That is what you need to dig out of the old filing cabinet or boxes in the attic. I myself settled some debt about ten years ago, and I sure hope I don't get a bill in too...that would suck, but I have all the letters they sent showing that I didn't own anything more.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I didn't know that about "zombie debt" but the lady a couple above me (mama_says) seems to be right.  <br>  <br>  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, FDCPA, gives you the right to verify debts from debt collectors. Within 35 days of being contacted by a debt collector, you can send a letter requesting the collector validate your debt. This validation needs to include some documents from the original creditor proving you owe the debt, the amount you owe is valid, and the agency is allowed to collect the debt from you. Your request for validation must be made in writing and should be sent via certified mail with return receipt requested.<br>  <br>  Attached link.|`|AA10491661	do you owe the money? don't matter if its 13 days old or 13 years in that case.

This is part of the reason we are in this finical mess.|`|32zBW5uCaa	NO.  Do not even respond to the collection agency.  This is called a "zombie debt."  If you talk to them on the phone, or send them any kind of mail response, it will re-activate the debt and they can legally try to collect it.  You do not owe it, at this point, do nothing with it.

9YLMj9SZaa	These products are definitely limited to as to how they advertise.  Which is why you don't see tobacco commercials any more.  Come to think of it, I don't can't recall the last time I've seen a cigarette ad or even a billboard for that matter.  If you watch commercials for pharmaceutical products, you hear them mention the possible side effects, they are required by law to disclose this information to you.  I know they are limits on alcohol commercials, but I don't know exactly what they are.  <br>  <br>  So, do they have they the right?  Yes, but it is a limited right, unlike freedom of speech.  Freedom of speech does not guarantee you the right to say whatever you want, whenever you want, like some people believe.  For example, you cannot stand in a crowded room and yell "fire."  That is an actual crime and freedom of speech will not protect you from the consequences.  Advertisers cannot make claims that are untrue and the FDA requires if a product is potentially harmful, it is displayed both on the product and in the advertisements.|`|VpR6qvb5aa	Yes, of course. How else could they sell their products?<br>  And despite the rantings of a previous poster, these and other "harmful" products are generally safe when used in MODERATION. People should be free to decide for themselves what they use, and what they abuse. <br>  Or, to put it another way, what products AREN'T harmful when misused?|`|DSLlioPcaa	Freedom of Speech protects the advertiser legally but morally the company with "sin products" should curtail advertising that are harmful to the consumer.|`|jEQ0s6oLaa	Personally I think tobacco, are alcohol are horrible. They should have never been invented in the first place. They are the thing that screws up the world and for what? To look "cool"? To act "cool"? To take you away from reality for awhile until you have to go to the d*** store and by some more till your F***ing dead as a door knob on the floor while the people who love you are crying there eyes out or jumping off of bridges because there so d*** depressed? GO DRINKERS, KILL THE WORLD YOU D*** B********. (sorry for the language but it makes me mad). You were given one life to live so why not live your life to the fullest. No matter what you do, your actions ALWAYS affect those around you whether you being a burden, an influence on someone, or emotionally killing someone by your choice. Please make the right choice to not promote the bad actions. <br>  <br>  Sorry getting back to the topic at hand. I believe they have the right, I just don't approve of it at all. Its a tasteless thing to do and should be done away with at all costs (okay, not violence).
G0qsVfoUaa	They never asked you to have a fancy phone. Many people manage to get along without them (me for one) so no reason they should pay for it. Use the phone you were given for work, use your own on your own time.<br>  Ask up front with your boss about being on call, since there are 5 employees then why not set a week each for being the one 'on call' that way it is less than once a month. <br>  <br>  Be happy you still have a job, let alone one that gives you any perk including a phone. Tough to get any decent work anywhere at the moment, so I wouldn't be making a mountain out of a molehill until things get better out there!|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	An easy call in a good economy is made far more difficult in a lousy one.  If your segment of the industry is in good shape you have additional leverage.  If not you're out of luck and are stuck with what you have.  I think my approach would be to discuss the situation with your boss in much the same manner as you have laid it out in your question with strong consideration to maximum diplomacy.  Present it as a problem that you have which he may be able to help resolve.  Most bosses like that kind of thing.|`|SsB7aRExaa	If you are on salary, you ARE being paid to be on call.  If you are paid hourly, then you must be paid for the hours you work.<br>  <br>  No way would I use personal property (like a phone) to make my boss's life easier, or make money for my employer.  If they gave you a plain phone for work, use a plain for for work. If they don't like it, tell them they can either get a phone with the capabilities they want, or the can accept the results from the phone they gave you.  Stand your ground.  Don't take the easy way out by using your phone.<br>  <br>  You will probably need to find a different job. I suggest you start NOW.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Humm, dont know what state you live in, but did you agree to all this?  There is usually a labor board to check with.  How often are you asked to just drop everything and go to this work site?  It certainly seems that you are being taken advantage of. I would at least give back the phone he gave you and tell him you prefer to use your own. Maybe you can get reimbursed for what ever he pays for the cheap cell service he provides.|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	if you are salary you are required to to do what they want, if you are hourly than you may have to do some negotiating with the boss or go to the labor board|`|1HLPznZhaa	You made your first mistake when on your own you decided to use your personal phone for the company's business.. If you don't get paid to be on call I don't see how you can be expected to take calls.. Your company is under no obligation to reimburse you for your phone as you were issued a company phone.. I don't know your position but it sounds like you and your " boss " need to sit down and have a meeting of the minds..Also if you are using your own phone for personal calls on the companys time thats a no-no ..|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	You left out one important detail about your job...are you paid a salary or are you paid by the hour? If you are a salary employee, your company basically "owns" your working hours (which is why I've never been a salary employee) and they can basically call you in whenever they want and get you to do whatever they need done, unfortunate, but that's the way it works. If you are paid by the hour however, then you should not be expected to work outside of your normal work hours, and when you do you should be paid over time pay which is usually time and a half when it comes to the amount you earn. Also, if you are paid by the hour, your boss should ask you if you can come to work, not demand you show up at work, unless you work for an emergency service like police, fire, military, etc where they expect you to work whenever they want you to work or need you to work.|`|skz3EqUXaa	I am one of those "loser" bosses.

No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address.

211Wwh6Laa	Well, if you are having trouble concentrating on your schooling, and you can afford to quit, then you are certainly free to choose that route.  And, as for the job market after you graduate, it depends on how long it will take you to graduate.  The future is unforeseen as you know, so the job prospects could be great in a few years, about the same, or worse than they are now.<br>  <br>  It may also serve you well to stick with working while going to university because it will show that you are capable of juggling two major responsibilities in life.  This is what helped me get a job after my job of thirteen years shut down.  My new employer was impressed that I had maintained nearly straight A's in college (online...as a former online student, he felt strongly that this was a harder task than regular college, and in a lot of ways I know it is because I've had experience with both forms), and working in the same company for thirteen years, and raising a child.  He felt that it was impressive that I successfully juggled it all, and chose me over three other applicants with just as much experience in manufacturing as I had.  So...sometimes sticking with it can actually benefit you in the long run.<br>  <br>  Have you thought of speaking to your college advisor about transferring some of your college courses to a distance learning program?  I'm not sure of your major (culinary arts?), but there are a lot of colleges that are going this route...not only for financial reasons for students, but also because they see many students dropping out to join the workforce, and want to keep attendance high.  You could take some of your basic classes through distance learning, and do the practical training (such as practical cooking meetings) on campus.  It would free up your time a bit because you could study at the hours you feel able to rather than dealing with attending class at a set time each day.<br>  <br>  Just a thought...|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	I don't know what uni is but today's profesional must juggle 2 things at once & a job with a boss thats flexable is hard to come by!|`|Scq7n4dkaa	Escort?>Lapdancer?>:)

DorePwVOaa	Pennsylvania law says that minors under the age of sixteen can only get very specific jobs. Looking at the law, the only "job" I see that you can work before you turn 16 is as a caddy on a golf course - so obviously that's only a summer job.

This applies, for example, to banks and daytraders.  On average, they pay more, not less, in tax because of this rule.  (The tax on unrealized gains costs them more, on average, although probably not this year, then the benefit from deducting unrealized losses.)<br>  <br>  It is NOT optional for anyone.

bvUkgXsHaa	It's a corporate decision to cut costs and make it appear that profits are going up. The reason for that is that if profits climb, the executives get fat bonus checks... like in the millions of dollars.<br>  <br>  In fact, it's detrimental to the economy.<br>  <br>  (1)  Jobs going overseas means that company employees in the US get laid off. More money has to go out in unemployment contributions. An increase in cost.<br>  <br>  (2)  When a US employee gets laid off, his spending potential is reduced. That means there are fewer people to purchase the company's goods or services. A reduction in income.<br>  <br>  (3) The money sent to the outsource country never comes back to the US. This damages the economy by removing from its spendable income. Another reduction in income.<br>  <br>  (4)  The millions given to the executives is also not going to the bulk of the spending public thereby decreasing the people who will purchase the company's goods and services. Still another reduction in income.<br>  <br>  And, we're giving them our jobs because of the greed of a few, and because common sense is dead. <br>  <br>  It's the same logic that allows framers and ranchers to hire illegal aliens rather than pay some US company to come up with a better way to do whatever it is these illegal aliens do. About 200 or so years ago, the only way cotton could be picked was by hand. The only to do it in such a way as to be economically feasible was by the use of slaves. Uh oh... the slaves are freed. The cotton industry is going down the tubes... right? Well along comes this brainy guy named Eli Whitney who invents this contraption that allows cotton to be picked faster. Why didn't he invent it sooner? Because there wasn't a need for it sooner. Slave labor was cheap (practically free) and available.<br>  <br>  As you suggest, make it economically unfeasible for somebody to hire an illegal, or to outsource. We have enough laws on the books prohibiting stuff. We just need teeth in them. $50,000 for every illegal alien working on a farm... that should be sufficient to stop farmers and contractors from hiring them. $50,000 charged to any company that gets a complain by somebody who talks to somebody in Bangladesh (or wherever) who can't speak or understand English.<br>  <br>  How can we do that? Well, the farmers are easy. A guy drives down the road and sees some people working in the field. Probably cause. Gets out and starts to request documentation. The rancher walks up and asks what's going on. The guy flashes his INS badge or police badge, or whatever and writes out a bill for half a million dollars. The guy can contest it, but that'll just cost him more money.<br>  <br>  Contractors would be a little tougher. But a guy drives down the street and sees some people on the roof of a building, or digging a ditch, or painting a fence... probable cause... and the same as above.<br>  <br>  Require the phone companies to track (in both directions) the routing of every phone call that leaves the US. If one of the hops is a business in the US, and another hop is to some third-world country... probably cause. Count the calls to the foreign country through the US company, multiply by $50,000 and send a copy of the phone company records and the bill.<br>  <br>  But people would go bankrupt. Maybe a few, but I don't expect people would be prone to gamble if they knew the consequences. It's not the severity of a punishment that is a deterrent... it's the certainty of it.<br>  <br>  Addenda:<br>  <br>  For her would promote outsourcing as an economically intelligent move... Were I a greedy moron who can't find a way to cut costs and increase productivity in the company, yeah... outsourcing is an easy way out. <br>  <br>  But here's the deal. The US company would pay say $5,000 a month for a US employee. Now it can outsource to Slobovia for $3,000. So Slobovian International, Inc. (SII) takes the job off the hands of the US public. SII takes about $2,000 of that, probably $2,500 and gives $500 to somebody who's trying to feed his or her family. Where does the $2,500 go? Well, probably $500 goes for renting a place for the people to work and maybe another $500 for phone lines. And $1,500 goes into the pocket of the greedy <bleep> running SII for exploiting his country's people like the US company is shafting it's employees... or ex-employees.|`|k2wiYJAcaa	you sound really ignorant.<br>  <br>  <br>  if you were a ceo of a company, and could pay someone four dollars an hour, without  benefits, who happens to live out of the country, or a person who wants ten dollars an hour, plus benefits, which would you chose?<br>  <br>  reallly.<br>  <br>  <br>  unions. good but not to the extent they are currently used.

However, they will put a temporary hold on the money and it won't be available until the funds officially clear.

When you file bankruptcy you need to list all your debts (including mortgage) and all your assets (including real estate).<br>  <br>  However you do have the option of surrendering any of your secured assets in bankruptcy rather than keeping the asset and the loan for which it is collateral.<br>  <br>  The amount of time until you need to move out varies from state to state.  In my state it is about 7 months, but in other states it may be shorter or longer, depending on your state's foreclosure laws.  In states that require "judicial foreclosure" it will take longer than in states that do not.<br>  <br>  If you surrender your home in bankruptcy your credit report may report it either as a foreclosure or as included in bankruptcy.

(Tell them you just won $7,500 and need some advice...if they will discuss $7,500 with you and take it seriously, you can trust them with the $750,000)...<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|SLQPoMK2aa	One reason to take the annuity is that you would pay taxes immediately on the full amount  of the upfront payment, versus over time on the annuity (At least that's the way it works for the lottery in MN)<br>  <br>  It is easy to do the math.<br>  <br>  Figure out how much you would get to keep after taxes on the $750,000.<br>  <br>  Here are some numbers, I am assuming:<br>  <br>  750,000 is a pretax number.<br>  50,000 is a pretax number<br>  you receive the payments 1x per year.<br>  <br>  The implied rate is 4.4% - that is what rate would get you 25 $50,000 payments that are worth 750,000 today.<br>  <br>  So if you toook the $750,000 and paid taxes.<br>  <br>  Lets assume a tax rate of 40%. You would get to keep $450,000 <br>  <br>  In order to invest $450,000 to receive $50,000 per year you would need to earn a rate of 10.1% annually. That is about the long term average retrun for large US stocks over this century.<br>  <br>  <br>  Where this gets more complicated is that the annual payments  from the annuity versus outside the annuity will be treated dfferently for taxes after you receive it.<br>  <br>  One thing for sure - the annuity is taxed 100% when you get it, the outside of annuity is dependent on how you invest it.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would ask how much you actually want cash - if you have other things you want to do with it, This is not just about maximizing your earnings, but also about quality of life.<br>  <br>  As an aside I would be sure that the annuity had a survivor clause - that is if you die somebody else gets the payments.<br>  <br>  ==========================<br>  <br>  The advice about saying $7,500 is a reasonable idea, but I would use $75,000 not $7,500. No  broker would be interested in $7,500 - he may not even be "allowed" to open an account that size, and would be givng away his services. No brokerage firm is going to pay him for an account that size. Any advisor with experience would not even spend any time on a $7,500 account. You would get a rookie

NUtQkHIeaa	You should register with an affiliate marketing company. <br>  <br>  An affiliate marketing company is basically a middle man, listing advertising banners from 100s of companies. Once you've registered with the affiliate marketing company you can begin to request advertisements which you can copy and paste into your website. <br>  <br>  Affiliate marketing companies are free to join. It costs you nothing to display the advertisements on your website. There is no cost to you at all. <br>  <br>  Payment varies from one advertisement to the next. Most work on a paid per click, paid per lead or paid per sale basis. The earning potential is good.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of affiliate companies I use. I have been using them for quite some time and have had a few good payouts.<br>  <a href="http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=3&id=80858" rel="nofollow">http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=3&i...</a><br>  <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(60)a(1541614)g(1447)" rel="nofollow">http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(60...</a>|`|pVzwvoGXaa	You can use services such as Google Adsense which will pay you based on clicks but you will need a large amount of traffic to generate a decent revenue stream or there are a number of options available such as:<br>  <br>  affiliate marketing - try websites such as buy.at or clixgalore.com - this is where you get paid depending on how much the customer spends with them and comes through your website. <br>  <br>  contextual ad links - websites like Kontera will create a piece of code that you can place at the bottom of your website which will turn text into links advertising related products.<br>  <br>  Payment is made through Paypal, Bank or Cheque|`|l9Rta9A1aa	Try google adsense.

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	It depends on the package. Some packages require a signature (depends on the company shipping the package and what service they paid for), if the package requires a signature, you must be home, or someone else must be home, to sign for the package and accept the package. If the package does not require a signature, they will leave it on the doorstep or with a neighbor if one is available. If the package requires a signature, they will leave a little sticky note on your door, you can call them and arrange a re-delivery time and date. If you can't be home during their re-delivery time and dates, it's best to go pick up the package yourself directly at UPS but not at a UPS store as that is not where the packages from UPS go when they are waiting to be delivered.|`|NfiXNNGbaa	its up to the driver.......i used to work for them. the driver decides if there is a safe location to leave the package. you could leave a note for him with instructions where to leave it, to avoid a trip to the ups pick-up|`|4TqUgtpzaa	It depends on the person/company shipping to you. I have ordered books from Ebay that required a signature, meaning UPS would not just leave the package at my door. I have also ordered from places like Target, who do not require a package to be signed off on. Maybe call the company you ordered from, or UPS?<br>  <br>  Also, if you miss the package three times, you can go to the post office and pick it up. UPS will leave a slip every time they attempt to drop something off, so you will know when they plan to come to your house, and how many times they have come.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	UPS doesn't deliver to the UPS Store. They either leave the package at your door or you have to go to their processing center. Since UPS office is about 30 minutes from my home, I prefer FedEx, which is minutes away and on the way home from my work. You might consider having packages delivered to your work in the future.

There isn't any generalized program that will pay people's mortgages when they don't have the money to pay it, regardless of the reason.<br>  <br>  Some people have income continuation insurance of some sort, but you have to take this out and pay the premiums on it before you need the benefits.  Some people have savings that they can tap into if an emergency arises and they are unable to make their mortgage payment.<br>  <br>  But a lot of people are just one emergency away from losing their home and their livelihood (job).<br>  <br>  You might talk to a bankruptcy attorney to see whether your situation merits consideration of filing bankruptcy.

coXB7vf1aa	Online Marketing can involve promoting other people's products online and receiving a commission, creating a webstore and people buying products or creating your own digital product and selling it online.<br>  <br>  SEO stands for search engine optimization. People come to the internet to look for information either for research or for buying products.  <br>  <br>  Google is the most widely used search engine on the planet.  Their algorithms are designed in such a way that their bots will crawl websites with worded content to pick out keywords that tend to be repeated and that people could possibly be searching for when they type them in the Google search bar. Google keeps a massive database of keywords in their Google Keyword Tool.<br>  <br>  Now, you can either use Google's paid advertising program called Adwords, or you can decide to market your website the free way: make your website search engine friendly (SEO) so that it can be indexed on Google, preferably on its very front page when someone inputs a keyword.  Not too many people will look past the first page of results.<br>  <br>  Most people make the mistake of renting webhosting, getting a domain name, and creating a website without doing the proper research for what they're selling, forgetting to see what the competition is like for their niche, forgetting to determine if there is enough of a market, figuring out what keywords they're willing to use, finding the right niche to promote in or if it has affiliate products that you can make money from at all. <br>  <br>  What's even worse, many ebooks prey on this ignorance and sell you half the answers or part of it, giving you very vague, non-specific information, causing you to have to go wasting money on another ebook to figure out what you're missing. <br>   <br>  Before engaging in online marketing, learn how to market from the right expert.  If you dash off with some knowledge, but not all, you can inadvertently end up spamming and possibly getting banned or end up wasting hordes and hordes of time and money.  It's happened to many of us who started out.<br>  <br>  There are legitimate coaching programs out there that do care.  They're not the cheapest, but they're not terribly expensive either.  A genuine coaching program can cost $1000 or more per year.  These often involve phone consultation of weekly lessons.<br>  <br>  Or...<br>  <br>  You can consider a cheaper program with video tutorials that you can view at your leisure, but it's very comprehensive.  The explanations are easy, and you will understand basic internet marketing in no time.  You'll implement the right techniques and get the right results within days, not months.  <br>  <br>  Nothing is more of a downer than wasted effort.  Nothing is more of motivator than making your first dollar.  So think carefully before rushing into any online marketing endeavor.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, keep up your efforts.  You will not millions overnight, but you can make a million in a year, if you do it smartly.|`|WEhTokUjaa	I used a company called SBI! to build my website.

These ads are called adsense ads. If someone clicks on an ad on your website, you get paid a small amount.<br>  <br>  SEO stands for search engine optimization. It just refers to the processes involved in getting a website to appear near the top of the list returned by a search engine when a term is queried.<br>  <br>  So if someone is looking for slum dog online and types slum dog into the search box, there are a lot of sites currently talking about slums dog but it is the best optimized site that appears in the top position. And it is the sites that appear in the top 3 that tend to get the bulk of visitors<br>  <br>  hope this helped and good luck
