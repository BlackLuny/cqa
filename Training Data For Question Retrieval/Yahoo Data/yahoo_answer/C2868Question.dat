20090128134653AAVymXA	Dining Out;United States;New York City	Any nice restaurants for teens in NYC?	In March I'm turning 14, and I'm planning on having a Girl's Night Out party in NYC with about 13-15 of my friends. We are planning on taking the train there (with my mother of course) and once we get there we would go to a nice restaurant. Due to the recession, I need a cool restaurant that my friends would like that have dinners from around $22 to $28 each. And hopefully near Grand Central please? If anything, a subway stop away. Your help would be very much appreciated :D      Please and thank you!
