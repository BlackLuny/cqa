GUP7U6nvaa	without knowing what state your in or the specific code section you were cited for it's hard to say.  The term speeding is a relative thing.  Most people believe that speeding is going above the posted speed limit.  This is not true.  Most states have a specific code section that applies to the road conditions.  In California (and i can only speak for Californai) there is a section in the vehicle code called 22350: Speed unsafe for road conditions present.  What that means is, regardless of whether or not you were going the "posted" speed limit, your speed was too fast for the conditions (ie: you caused an accident).<br>  <br>  More than likely you were cited for the aforementioned type of code section and were in essence "speeding" regardless of how fast you were actually going or what the posted speed limit was.<br>  <br>  -Tyris|`|tlt4uYObaa	if you have witness that would be your savior.if they have intersection on tape that would help.As far as speeding he is saying that was the contributing factor.Your only hope to go to court and if the judge will listen to why you hit car he might drop charge.As far as air bag you could have been speeding and slowed down enough not to activate it.|`|7ZN2ExwGaa	Mikey and Tyris are absolutely correct|`|AA10163820	I tend to think Tyris gave you the correct answer.<br>  <br>  Anytime you hit something in front of you, you're almost certainly going to be found at fault.  <br>  <br>  Think of it this way:<br>  <br>  If you had been traveling zero miles an hour, would you have hit the truck in front of you?  Of course not.<br>  <br>  If you had been traveling ten miles an hour?  Probably not.<br>  <br>  Twenty?  Probably not again.<br>  <br>  Twenty-five?  Maybe.  And if so, then you were traveling too fast.  It's your job as a driver to not drive any faster than you can safely do so - even if that means driving slower than the speed limit.<br>  <br>  It may not seem fair or even reasonable to you but if you run into something in front of you, it's pretty hard to claim you were traveling at a safe speed.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	Why did the officer say that you were speeding?<br>  <br>  Lawyers can reconstruct accidents, if it's that important to you.<br>  The accident is more serious.<br>  Doesn't matter, you entered the lane of the other car. You will always be found at fault, no matter what the reason. Except if you are knocked into the other person way.<br>  <br>  It's your job to seek out the truck that veered into your path.<br>  So bottom line is. They'd rather for you to kill you and hurt you, than for you to save yourself and injure someone else by going into their lane.<br>  <br>  Brandy the pop star hit the car in front of her, that car hit this womans car and now Brandy is being sued for wrongful death.
Ta2lNKUVaa	My stepdad is British and was one of the last RAF F-4 pilots.

AK4Iw118aa	The rich don't exist to spite Obama. The rich exist to make money. And no, you wouldn't sacrifice your riches just to spite Obama. This is one of the dumbest questions I ever read in Yahoo politics. And that's really saying something.|`|houWY7qvaa	A lot of rich people are compassionate and give back to the community.  Others are insensitive and greedy.  The stock market was and is a farce and I'm not worried if rich people lose all of their money in it, or are mad because they don't want to share, I don't depend on them. One should really depend on what they can do to help, instead of downgrading someone who can't help.  It's not about who gets what, or who has to pay.  It's about helping our own.   The people who are forgotten are those who can't do anything about anything anyway.  They struggle to survive each day.  So much is wasted in this country by the extravagant lifestyles and yet they complain about those who can't or won't care for themselves.  No one cares about the millions who died, intentionally or unintentionally in this war.  No one cares about the unfair arms deals or the scam with the gas prices.  But they do care about leaving the poor to slave for the rich.

What a  F,ing joke .|`|TBvUomw7aa	I actually do think that this is a viable question.  The rich should be entitled to retaliate.  I live in Northern California Liberalville, which oddly enough hasn't been hit as hard by the fact that "everyone" is losing their jobs and "everyone" is foreclosing (although I don't know a single person who has been laid of or foreclosed within the last five years--making me believe that it is government propaganda using the MSM to infiltrate the stock market as the people are such suckers...remember all of the other lies that they have told, peeps.  These people that think that the rich should be taxed higher is a dime a dozen.  The popular consensus is that it isn't to level the playing field...it is because they won't suffer.  <br>  <br>  Uh...that argument is crap.  Not because it is wrong, but we are in a consumer-based economy.  Those who make more money SPEND more money.  They are in more debt than broke fools like me because they have nicer houses, cars, etc.  So, logically, being that big business gets bailed out when they can't pay off their debts (although they can't with bailout money), shouldn't the upper-middle class be bailed out if they can't make their mastercard payment as their taxes have gone up just enough to where they can't fit that in their budget?<br>  <br>  If I was actually rich, I would do what the rich people do best:  Operate out of the Cayman Islands.

I would guess that neither of them are right and if you are killing each other all of the time, how can you be?  From the western perspective, the Israelies are in the right and they are victims of Islam, who have stirred up some drama for no apparent reason except for the fact that they are terrorists who just want to slit throats.  Realistically, it is probably over the "holy land."  The Brits decided to create a Jewish State in the middle east in the 40's and they have been there ever since.<br>  <br>  It all seems really stupid and really silly but I think that they both want to kill each other and being that the Christians are supposed to be protectors of the "chosen people," we (since we are all Christians in the West) have to get involved and help fight the good fight!<br>  <br>  Oddly enough, I read recently that in the Koran it states that eventually, there will be a leader pretending to be Christian and manipulating all of the other Christians into fighting the Muslims.  Mohammed and Jesus are going to come back to Earth and help the Muslims fight the Christians off, who are working under a false prophet.<br>  <br>  Who knows what the truth is...Odds are that anything that you hear via the MSM is wrong and I don't think that you can get an accurate answer on what this drama is over.|`|TuizUTZCaa	They want their land back.

But since people can no longer vote to change, they're going to have to come up with something much more drastic. Additionally nobody will stand up to dictatorship because they will undoubtedly be bought up, threatened or killed.

You would be left with only a hand full of third world countries. And most likely you live in one of those evil military backed countries.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Paul -don’t they have books where you live? Where the single global TCP/IP network originated <br>  <br>  BRIEF HISTORY of the INTERNET<br>  <br>  The Internet originated in the late 1960s when the United States Defense Department developed ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency network), an experimental network of computers designed to withstand partial outages such as a bomb attack. The agency sought to create a web of computers that could continue to communicate with each other, even if some of the computers were disabled. In the mid-1980s, when desktop computer workstations became increasingly popular, organizations wanted to connect their local area networks (LANs) to ARPAnet. If computers could link together and share resources, everyone would benefit.<br>  To help speed the connections, the National Science Foundation (NSF) established five super computing centers in 1986, creating the NSFnet backbone. In 1987, the NSF signed a cooperative agreement to manage the NSFnet backbone with Merit Network, Inc., and by 1990, ARPAnet had been phased out. NSFnet continued to grow, and more and more countries around the world connected to this Internet backbone.<br>  <br>  1991 was a big year for the Internet: The National Research and Education Network (NREN) was founded and the World Wide Web was released. The Internet is still dominated by scientists and other academics, but begins to attract public interest. With the release of the Mosaic Web browser in 1993 and Netscape in 1994, interest in and use of the World Wide Web exploded. More and more communities become wired, enabling direct connections to the Internet. In 1995, the U.S. federal government relinquished its management role in the Internet and NSFnet reverted back to being a research network. Interconnected network providers are strong enough now to support U.S. backbone traffic on the Internet. However, the presidential administration encourages continued development of the U.S. backbone of the Internet, also knows as the National Information Infrastructure (NII)-- and, most commonly, as the "Information Superhighway".<br>  <br>  <br>  Russia had developed a crude form of Morse code that could be transmitted over a phone line but that was not what you are using now, and Marconi could actually take more credit for the phone line than Russia.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	I want to thank you all for making Rush Limbaugh  the new head of the republican party.

AA11672256	After delimitation, 84 seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 47 seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes respectively in the Lok Sabha.<br>  <br>  As of date, no political party has come out with its full list of candidates contesting the 2009 General Elections. So it is not possible to give the number of BC/OBC candidates in the fray patywise.<br>  <br>  There is little substance in your demand for reservation of seats for BC/OBC candidates who converted to Christianity, Sikhism, Islam, Jainism or Buddhism from Hinduism. Casteism exists in Hinduism only and not those other religions. That is precisely the reason why lower caste Hindus converted to those religions. They were free from caste based discriminations in their new belief. Introducing reservations for converted candidates would amount to tampering with their religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  Finally, reservations in India have served no useful purpose. It has all along remained a political carrot to lure votes from the backward classes. Reservation is something that should be done away with as early as possible as it only widens the social divide and causes attrition.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Afterthoughts: -<br>  Reservations are not extended to all convertees excluding those who converted to Islam, as a rule, as observed by you. There are several tribes who have converted to Christianity and are considered as Sceduled Tribes (STs). Referred to as Adivasis, they are some of the oldest people of the sub-continent whose origin can be traced back to pre-Aryan times. But can you show a Scheduled Caste (SC) member from the people who converted to Christianity? Casteism is forsaken once a person adopts Christianity and hence the answer is "No".<br>  <br>  As for people of Brahminical origins (simply put, the Upper Castes) eating the cream, isn't there people with the same mindset, the same lust for power and position among the reserved sections of Indian society? There are people amongst backward classes who have reaped the harvest of reservation but are disinclined to see their less fortunate brethren reaching the same commanding heights. They want to be lord and masters of the less fortunate section. Equality wouldn't help here. And if you said "No", just look around at the scores of Dalit politicians and Government servants who are enjoying the bonanza of reservation.<br>  <br>  I will repeat that reservation is a social evil, the faster it is done away with, the better.|`|GllB4mPZaa	Curse CMs concerned now .|`|rpDvbBkAaa	If the initials are B C or O B C for a person, then such persons come under castes created by the government.<br>  villages are there for persons, without caste affiliation, to spend life;<br>  not every one is ambitious to live in cities;<br>  so, the governments should not mesmerize reluctant people with government named castes and bring them to cities;<br>  it will be a ruse for the government to swallow village lands and push the people into more distress.

Because you harm YOURSELF.<br>  <br>  Add to that the fact that weed is far less harmful than many legal substances (and a more effective analgesic than most, hence 'medical marijuana'), I think the only people benefiting from its illegality are politicians, crooked cops, gangsters and all such parasites on society.|`|A90SRsTxaa	Yes. <br>  I could go off into a huge spill and add links that prove that crime increases whenever you ban any thing, and Marijuana is much less harmful than things like alcohol.

Sure the gov't could make money if they sold it in drug stores, but what's to stop people from growing it all the time & smoking for free? Plus, the gov't has the power to confiscate houses, cars, money, etc with it being illegal. The gov't can steal your house if they catch you selling the stuff, then turn around and sell the house for 100% profit. They could sell a $500,000.00 house for $50.00 and make $50 off the deal. It's too good for them to keep it illegal. Plus it makes the "drug war" which has been fought since the 60's look like it is a real issue.

The reason for this is that in practice it can be difficult to "prove" to your your bank, the passport service, your employer etc that you have in fact changed your name. The deed poll is really just a legal document that these organisations will accept as evidence of the name change, which makes things a lot easier.<br>  <br>  There are lots of companies (eg <a href="http://www.ukdps.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukdps.co.uk/)</a> which can organise a deed poll for you if you decide to go down this route - you do not need to use a solicitor.  The likely cost will probably be around ￡33-￡50 depending on how many copies of the documentation you request.

Laws must apply to all and protect all of our rights and freedoms. <br>  <br>  Imagine, for instance, if Rick Santorum, a Republican Catholic, voted down Title X contraceptive funding in the Senate because according to his faith it is wrong for women to control the number of babies they have using medical technology such as the pill or condoms. Even though 98% of women use contraceptive in this country he voted based on a religious conviction that would have been to the detriment of others. <br>  <br>  By the way, I'm not joking. The above description is true. <br>  <br>  I do not want my rights and the Constitution subject to the particular views of one faith by politicians who can't seem to separate governance and liberty from their personal faith. We all know that politicians are not paragons of virtue, either. Their job is simple: protect our freedom, tax responsibly, and keep government effective. <br>  <br>  I don't care if a politician invokes a god or has a strong faith - I just have a big problem if they use it to control or take away opportunities from our citizens.|`|s7TaxmIGaa	Religion is personal and one on one .People have very different views on religion  some believe in Jesus .some do not,some believe in icons,religious statues ,holy water etc .some do not.. some believe in kneeling and praying 3 times a day ,some do not .Some believe a woman  can lead a church (ie pastor or priest) and ,some do not.  Some do not  believe in God or Jesus at all . There have been many religious wars over the years and millions have died.. all in the name of God . Most people never practice what they preach or what they want others to believe and this can cause problems in leardeship if they are ever found out . It is best to leave religion at home and in personal lives and have government rule without certain religious beliefs so  it can be fair  and be for all the people not just certain  ones who have certain religious beliefs This is the only fair and equitable way . Keep  religion  and government separate . Let freedonm ring ~ The  United States of America  is based on religious "freedom"|`|1NO10YfPaa	Because it usually, if not always, means that some religion is trying to establish itself as the official religion of this nation and the Constitution says "there shall be no establishment of religion" for a good reason given the history of nations where there has been an establishment of religion.|`|kE29abUUaa	Religion has no place in government.<br>  Just look at Reagan and Bush.

It's mans interpretation of what they think God would want. <br>  <br>  There are so many different religions and different ways of thinking, I don't understand how one religion can say this is the only way.<br>  <br>  Actually since there are so many religions, I am not sure why they are not called theory's.|`|yKLBdoigaa	Just do not intercept 'their' God, and there should be not problem.

jGAX8sSlaa	Illegal Immigration has been a factor in Every nation. From the Mongol Horde to the Visigoth and the Moores. Ask the Apache what happens when Immigration is not controlled?<br>  <br>  True story<br>  A few hundred illegal immigrants moved into what is now Texas. The Mexican government tried to work with them, offered them amnesty if they would agree to a treaty. The illegal immigrants signed the treaty but never followed it. Then the illegal immigrants stole a cannon and shot at Mexican troops who came to recover it. After finally having enough the Mexican govt. sent troops led by the war hero Santa Anna to San Antonio where these criminal were hiding in a small church. The illegals were massacred but that got ALL the locals mad and the ensuing revolt led to Texas becoming a free nation. <br>  <br>  Until they joined the United States for protection anyway.|`|FpioJ7F5aa	There is a huge amount of difference between the colonization that Europe did and the idea of illegal aliens arriving in your country in 2009.  While some of the European Colonization was exploitative, a great deal of it also brought modern medicine, modern government, modern economics.  Where the local natives were dying like fly's from Leprosy, after the colonization, they were segregated and provided an opportunity to live their lives.  In many, many cases, the colonization was christian in its nature.  Not perfect... very good for its time in many cases.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you examine the colonization of Africa, you will find excellent examples for what you are interested in.|`|c30e7d5dc21c881fa2b4e10f9ca03ee5aa	slightly strange way you word your question. But almost all nations have undergone some form of immigration. Some more than others. Nations like japan have almost none, and this has led to a very strong cultural identity (and rightly so).

Basically the buck stops with you any breach of the licensing law you are legally responsible and will find yourself in court, it will be no good saying you aren't the manager/owner, you are the DPS and therefore legally responsible. If you aren't getting any extra money for this, unless you already are on a good wage your employer is having a laugh.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	i thought  you have to be  the owner  of  the  place  to  get  an alcohol license? if its for  your work and you don't own the place  you cant get  the license  unless  the  business  is in your name|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	You only need this if you own a pub or lease a pub.

It sets the listener up into a suggestive state. He knows perfectly well that no one, being the listener, is going to talk to this general. He has redirected the listeners focus off of himself and deflected any negative responsibility while retaining any positive power that the statement might carry for himself." <br>  I say "if you talk to Anna" or "if you talk to Frank" all the time. I don't know if they're actually going to talk to Anna or Frank. I don't even set it up that way. I just say it. Am I ambiguous?<br>  <br>  "'I think he would argue...' - He doesn't say that he 'knows' the general would argue. He again has deflected any negativity and retained the positive...by this point he's teflon and nothing will stick to him.'<br>  And yet, we're still going to hold him to his statement being true if Gen. Petraeus disagrees.<br>  <br>  "'part of the success...'- here he has either said that the general is claiming success yet as we go on you can see that he is claiming the success without actually saying that there was success, which would not jibe with his former statements on the validity of Iraq in the first place." <br>  It depends which success we're talking about. Taking Sadam Hussein out of power? That definitely jibes with what he's said previously - that mission has been accomplished. Finding WMDs? Not so much.<br>  <br>  "finally the use of 'we' and 'us'- he doesn't say who we and us are. Because he has established that the general is speaking through him, again, he has taken no responsibility yet retains the positive aspect." Again, I suspect that this has been taken out of context. If this was in a newspaper or the like, it would have stated elsewhere in the article or even the paragraph who "we" and "us" are. As it is, I must assume that "we" and "us" refers to the US Army, since that's who's in Iraq right now.|`|jRXQ6kgCaa	And you think this was all scripted before it was said!!!

Deregulation:  It's bad policy to allow savings banks and insurance companies and investment banks and stock brokers to all get in bed together...and then turn off the lights.  The Bush administration and 'conservatives' in general have a insane belief that everyone who wears a suit, tie and shiny shoes is honest and not subject to greed and group think.  Personally I think the better a guy dresses the more likely he is to be subject to believing that the rules shouldn't stand in the way of profit....particularly when showing an increase in quarterly profits equal a bigger bonus and promotion.  This is where 'crime in the suites' comes from.  Think Enron!   You don't start two wars with no natural stopping place and borrow money from China to do it.  Far too many politicians voted for these wars, NONE of them insisted on a war tax to conduct them.  Bad policy..really bad.  In WW1 and WW2 the federal government issued 'War Bonds' to the American public...did you see any War Bonds this time around?  Side Bar:  Iraqi oil will pay for the war...remember that one?  Several hundreds of billons of what would have been tax dollars went into Swiss banks, never to be seen again...a lot of them 'corporate' dollars.  The Swiss and all those 'off shore' banks are stuffed with moola from American tax dodgers....legitimate tax dollars are getting laundered as we speak.  That popped up in the 'news' last week and promptly died...as we said when I was in the news biz....spiked!  Something stinks right there. Can you say, coverup? Trade deals that enriched the corporations and beggered the American wage-earner.  Sub-prime loans?  Millions of Americans get paid #$%^ because of 'Everyday Low Prices'. How can they afford to buy a house?   But wait!  There's more! The construction industry NEEDS buyers....check out the pressure these bums brought on 'our' government. Another story spiked!  Side deals that worked to US advantage were dumped by the Bush Junta because of corporate pressure.  A third spiked story!  The list goes on.  Here's a hint fellow posters.....Take care of the working class and the 'rich' will still be rich.  Take care of the 'rich' and the working class will take it in the shorts and in the end, the 'rich' will as well.  At least P/Obama is trying to reverse the stupidity of the last several decades.

The government created this problem. Democrats started this snowball rolling down the hill.

We are here because the republicans strayed from conservatism. <br>  <br>  As far as tax breaks are concerned, which generates more income for the government, a warehouse that is open, employing 50 people that is taxed at 20% or an empty building that is taxed at 40%?|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	the federal reserve caused this problem by raising interest rates ,which resulted in many mortgage failures. to try and blame this on other factors is stupid. please tell me who obama's chief of staff his,who his economic advisers raines and volcker are,and perhaps his treasury secretary. oh they were all involved in  banking and mortgages and they are directly involved in our economic problems. and who benefited from all  of this democrats. open your eyes and look at facts. democrats along with the federal reserve tanked our economy and they are raping us in the name of saving us|`|qOPjEvsFaa	The unemployment rate is at a 25 yr high because republican business owners are shedding jobs in anticipation of the coming Obomination.|`|UJZZ4bnLaa	obama is just cleaning up their mess!   as he said in his election it is going to get worse before it gets better.<br>  <br>  George Bush  seemed to take the approach if i tell everyone the economy is getting better they wont panic.  for the last 3 years bush  instead of accepting blame and  owning the  economic issues  would  continually  trying to convince us it was not as bad and was  turning the corner.<br>  <br>  years of giving corporations tax break after tax break  has only proven that  the corporations  are not responisble to either their workers or the  consumers.    those tax breaks that were supposed to trickle down and turn into raises  only went to  improving the bottom line and  bonuses for the  fat cats at the top of the  mess.  <br>  <br>  the economy had grown too big and  top heavy so it corrected itself and now we need to rebuild it.    <br>  <br>  The economy is a living thing just like a tree and when you grow a tree you must first start  at the bottom and feed the roots.   the  stronger the roots the  stronger the trunk of the tree.    in an economy the  roots are the workers.  they buy things  and grow the economy  much more than all the fat cats at the top|`|VuaOKpYXaa	The period of time from 1995 to 2007 when the Republicans controlled Congress showed the highest rate of employment in history.  The deregulation and tax cuts led to the greatest GDP growth and market value growth in history.<br>  <br>  You are correct that the debt is a cancer but tying it to a President (or Presidents) is ridiculous.  Congress passes the budget.  Congress has established the entitlements which can only get larger, never smaller.  Return the entitlement programs to the budget where they belong and give the President a line item veto.  Then you can blame the President for the deficit.  Better yet, pass a Balanced Budget Amendment and you won't have to blame anyone for a deficit ever again (unless , of course, there was a DECLARED war which could not be funded by taxes)<br>  <br>  The 2nd largest budget item after HHS is debt service.  If it were eliminated every Bush budget would have been shown massive surplus.  At 500 billion dollars it is rapidly approaching the $594 billion dollar total budget of the People's Republic of China.  Think about that for a second, we spend almost as much on interest payments alone as the Chinese do on their entire budget!  <br>  <br>  Look at it another way.  Obama's target deficit when he "halves" the deficit is $533 billion.  More realistic is about $600 billion.  This would mean we are adding the complete budget of the Peoples Republic of China to the debt every year.<br>  <br>  How long can this insanity continue?|`|cfusEJPFaa	Count, Nice try, but you're dead wrong.  The current economic mess is not of the republicans doing.  <br>  <br>  First of all, let's define terms:  The present crop of republicans do not express true conservative republican values.  They're a bunch of big government tax and spenders almost as bad as the democrats.<br>  <br>  Second, you need to look at the roots of this economic collapse.  The Community reinvestment act - a Democrat piece of legislation - forced banks to lend to people who had no business borrowing money.  It worked fine as long as the economy was advancing, but the slightest little bump - such as a sharp spike in oil - caused people to not be able to make their inflated mortgage payments, and the whole thing came off the rails.  If the democrats had just left the economy alone and let the market set interest rates and allowed banks to be responsible to their shareholders and only lend to people who were qualified, we would not be in this mess!<br>  <br>  Educate yourself.

So dems have to get it. They have to understand that we can never let a rep. in office again. We have the numbers we just have to have to remember many dems never voted before & are new to politics. I grew up around people who never voted. We have to help people. We have to let them know what is going on & what the need to do. Are there stupid people in this country or are they dellusional. Yes, but the healthy people have to take care of themselves. So I agree reps can't do it better. They are good at being loud though so we have to be louder. We do know what is best. I have established that in my mind. So it is time to move on to what we are going to do to make sure we don't let the drunks take the wheel.

Suggesting that he shouldn't have been prosecuted is redundant unless it is painfully obvious that the CPS didn't adhere to their test for whether or not to charge (basically either that it wasn't in the public interest to prosecute or there was insufficient evidence to secure a conviction).<br>  <br>  Lawyers are trained to use phrases like "in my submission" (legal argument), "If you please, sir/madam" etc. A typical closing argument would include something on the burden and standard of proof (not much though since the magistrates have heard it all before), dealing with damaging prosecution evidence, and dealing with any contested points of law.

If you want to sue someone you should consult a solicitor, for proper, professional advice.

In the US, personal injury is also based principally on negligence.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	I'm a little puzzled you say you want to bring a case for personal injury but what is the injury? Defamation is not a criminal act it is a tort which you can sue for in civil court, sending you alarming documents (again you don't provide much info) could be harassment this is a criminal offence and could be reported to the police, if you have been injured due to breach of health and safety this could be a criminal and/or civil matter, you could sue in civil court for negligence if you have been injured due to breach of health and safety, it is for the Health and Safety Executive to decide if criminal action would be taken.

HJaVcUGwaa	A good starting point to understand the politics of a conflict, is to understand its history.  You may be surprised to know that this conflict is neither ancient nor religious.  The conflict started in the 20th Century. Israel itself is only 60 years old. This conflict is not about religion either, as Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in peace and harmony in Palestine for hundreds of years before Israel's establishment in 1948. The conflict was really started during European colonialist times by European Zionists (a group of non-religious Eastern European Jews).

Its southwest point (at Raphia = Tell Rifa?, southwest of Gaza) is about 34° 15′ E. longitude, and its northwest point (mouth of the Li?ani) is at 35° 15′ E. longitude, while the course of the Jordan reaches 35° 35′ to the east. The west-Jordan country has, consequently, a length of about 150 English miles from north to south, and a breadth of about 23 miles at the north and 80 miles at the south. The area of this region, as measured by the surveyors of the English Palestine Exploration Fund, is about 6,040 square miles. The east-Jordan district is now being surveyed by the German Pal?stina-Verein, and although the work is not yet completed, its area may be estimated at 4,000 square miles. This entire region, as stated above, was not occupied exclusively by the Israelites, for the plain along the coast in the south belonged to the Philistines, and that in the north to the Phenicians, while in the east-Jordan country the Israelitic possessions never extended farther than the Arnon (Wadi al-Mujib) in the south, nor did the Israelites ever settle in the most northerly and easterly portions of the plain of Bashan. To-day the number of inhabitants does not exceed 650,000. Palestine, and especially the Israelitic state, covered, therefore, a very small area, approximating that of the state of Vermont.

The word Palestine comes from the Roman word, "Philistine" who were a tribe mentioned in the bible. People believe that the jews moved into palestine and took over their land. Nothing could be further from the truth. In biblical times. Palestinians and Jews lived there in peace, for hundreds of years. it wasn't until  about 1900, that the problem of different religions came to the fore. Eventually, to solve this problem, it was agreed to partition the land, so jews and palestinians would live on their own land.So, in 1920, under what is known as the Balfour treaty, (Originated by lord Balfour), it was agreed with Palestine, Egypt, and Jordan, that the Jews would live on land known as, The west bank, The Gaza strip, and what land today is modern Isreal.  The Jewish population then was about 1/3rd. of what it is today. Then after WW 2, with all the displaced jews in Europe who had survived the Death camps and had lost their homes and families, it was decided to give them the chance to live in Palestine. (It was not known as Israel yet) in the jewish lands. Then in 1948 there was a mass migration of these displaced Jews to Palestine, and in 1948 they renamed their land Israel. Ever since then, the Palestinians have tried to get them out by suicide bombings, Terrorist attacks etc. This was helped by the country of Egypt who had agreed to the \balfour treaty and signed it.. Ever since the formation Of the State of Israel, the palestiniand have waged war against the Jews, who have managed to repel all attacks. Because this new country was fighting for its existence, To try to appease them and as a gesture of peace between them, Israel has given back the Gaza strip to {Palestine, but that was not enough. The hamas group, who are funded by Iran, and Hezbollah, have contiuously waged war until Israel saw no solution to this unless it invaded Palestine and put down Hamas once and for all.

This would be among the largest troop mobilizations in the world.[99] In 2005, Iran's military spending represented 3.3% of the GDP or $91 per capita, the lowest figure of the Persian Gulf nations.[100] Iran's military doctrine is based on deterrence.<br>  <br>  Very few or irans troops will be trained, many will be women, they would not have enough weapons to arm them all. plus they rekon only 1 mil could be mobilised, lket them fight with ww1 rifles and sticks while we drop bombs and use a highly trained and mobile force outwit them.<br>  They're based on detterence. Remember 1 mil soldiers, 11mil civilians.|`|XzWwTukGaa	If both countries are fighting without allies, both countries can defend themselves from a foreign invasion.

OXGWs0fMaa	My kids were born in Germany while my husband was in the Army.  I had to get new copies of birth cert for them when the originals I had were lost.  <br>  <br>  We had to go through the State Dept in Wash DC to get new copies.  You should be able to google State Dept and birth certificate to find out how to get one.  You have to pay a fee and I needed them quickly so I paid extra to have them Fed Ex'd.  The form number is DS-1350 and it is a Certification of report of birth of a US citizen.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention whether she was born in Japan due to military service of her parents or not.  The certificate that I have doesn't specify military anyway, so it should be what you need.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you.  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  ** Sorry, I do see that you said military base...just missed that the 1st time through!
tROFU72waa	You'll be segregated from the cherrys except during the actual training in the AIT portion.

See what other programs are offered through FFSC about things like buying a house, a car, etc... If you are able to talk to the Navy College office on base, use your Tuition Assistance while you are still AD to get some credits out of the way plus doing some CLEP exams.|`|31d8c0ca03879295922dad03356637c4aa	all military branches have some sort of military transition program the army calls it ACAP  as for the navy I am not sure what it is called but I do know there is one Avaible so stop by your military transisiton office.  As for advice on getting out make sure everything is payed off like cars and credit cards and save up alot of money and make plans incase your original play falls through keep in mind that Colorado has a high cost of living rate and with the economy the way it is youll need as much savings as you can get|`|fsjIeVpRaa	Easy, grab your PCS orders and report to the CO of the CivDiv!|`|cfe693074760514255e63a1a5d0dba6eaa	Well, you're lucky I have come along. I too was in the Navy in specwar and then the Army. Blah blah blah, I'm a combat vet and so had a way harder time than you will. Point being however, that transitioning is easy if you prepare. First of all, since you are in the Navy and I'm pretty sure you're in a "pogue" job, you have all the time to get at the very least an Associate's degree while you're in. If you don't it's your fault as the Navy will pay the tuition so you don't have to touch your GI Bill. That being said, from what it sounds like you're not planning on doing the smart thing and going to school while you're still in. So I'll tell you, do your research on what school you want to go to. Then pick a community college that will transfer over to a 4-year. The reason being that even with a kicker, you only get 36 months of GI Bill and so will not have a full 4 year limit if you use the GI Bill all the way through. Additionally, if you get any scholarships/ financial aid, using the chapter 30 GI Bill might be a better deal for you as you would get to pocket more money than under the New GI Bill. So you would have to do your math on that as well. However, upon initial discharge from active duty you will assuredly make too much money to get financial aid and so will be tempted to sign up for the New GI Bill right away. Remember however that once you sign up for that you can't switch back. So in a nutshell here's my advice. Get your AA while on active duty and then switch to a 4-year once you get out. If not, then go to a community college and get your lower level classes done there for less. Then switch over to a 4-year by which time your income should be low enough after a year atleast (if you're a hard charger like I was and take a full load of credits each quarter) to get financial aid. If you do do this, don't be tempted to get the new GI Bill right away. Plan out your route first. Because financial aid should cover all of your tuition and so you should be able to pocket the 1300+ of the Chapter 30 GI Bill. Additionally, most schools will give some kind of veteran discount which will help as well. Also, don't be stupid and educate yourself on the many outlets to get cheap textbooks via internet sites. You don't have to buy from the school bookstore. Find out which books you'll need asap, the school will provide the information you need in plenty of time (it's a given) for you to get the books online. In the end, there is NO reason you should be in debt while getting your B.A. If you do go into debt, you did something wrong. Trust me, Colorado does not have cost of living as high as where I'm from. And finally, I know you're not going to listen to me on this but I'll say it anyway, don't get married. You're in Japan and he's in Virginia, it won't work out trust me. I know you think I don't know what you and you're fiance have, but trust me, your situation is nothing new and countless others have gone through the exact same thing. Plan on your future and he on his, and then if things meld together at the end get married. But not before.

JhC6BvPpaa	The usual Govt spin for having the CCTV was that "in areas where the CCTV exists, then crime actually fell".<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, all the thieves and vagabonds in the towns near me moved their business away from where the cams were sited, and soon realised that it was taking about 3-4 hours for the police to respond to 'petty crime'. So they thought it was okay to commit crime even more. And, considering around half of all crime doesn't actually get reported, then the real figures would double. Couple that with the fact that the police are rarely seen pounding the beat anymore, and I think most would clearly see why crime has gone up. <br>  <br>  I also forgot to mention the dreaded credit crunch and the poor souls that have lost their jobs and about to lose their jobs. I'm not trying to endorse crime, but many of those people will turn to it because of losing say ￡20K a year down to about ￡62 a week on the dole.

I live in North Carolina, and a major clothing mill MJ Soffee closed because they loss all business to the Chinese. They made T-shirts. and of course everybody remembers Hillary talking about getting the business back that made the magnets, Bill signed the paperwork to relocate the plant to China.<br>  <br>  (PS, while he was governor, Hillary was on the Board of directors of Wal-Mart)|`|u6ALw1gAaa	Do bears defecate in the woods?<br>  <br>  Of course he did.|`|AA11819105	He and Al Gore as a team did, you know the global warming hoax guy.<br>  You should ask why our government didn't intervene.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Sam Walton was a personal friend of Bill Clinton's and Hillary Clinton was on the Wal-Mart board of directors.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Denial. It's not just an attitude , it's a serious metal condition.<br>  <br>  There are several defining characteristics that identify the possibility that a patient may be in denial. Some examples include pretending something does not exist when in reality it does. Being willing to admit there is a problem, but unwilling to see the severity of it. Seeing the problem as being caused by something or someone else. The behavior is not denied, but its cause is someone else's responsibility. Offering excuses, alibis, justifications, and other explanations for behavior. Dealing with the problem on a general level; avoiding personal and emotional awareness of the situations or conditions. Changing the subject to avoid threatening topics. Becoming angry and irritable when reference is made to the condition. These defining characteristics help to avoid the issue at hand (Whitfield, 1994).<br>  <br>  Under the budget outline issued by the Obama administration, the US government will run a $1.75 trillion deficit during the current fiscal year, which ends September 30, nearly four times the largest previous federal deficit. This gargantuan sum includes the $700 billion allocated for the Wall Street bailout, more than half of it already spent, as well as part of the $787 billion in spending authorized by the economic stimulus bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama<br>  For fiscal year 2009, nearly half over, the federal government will borrow almost half of all the dollars it spends: $1.75 trillion out of a record expenditure of $3.94 trillion. The White House projects that spending in fiscal year 2010 will be only slightly lower, $3.55 trillion, with the deficit falling to a still staggering $1.17 trillion.<br>  According to the White House estimates, the combined deficit for the four years 2009-2012 comes to $4.42 trillion. The net debt of the federal government, what it owes to individuals, businesses and foreign countries, will double, rising from $5.3 trillion to $11 trillion over the same period.<br>  There is no discussion in the budget outline of where these vast sums will come from. Given the worldwide financial crisis, US borrowing on such a scale means that the American government will be competing with—and effectively denying funds for—the governments of other, weaker capitalist powers, many of which have already had to resort to borrowing from the International Monetary Fund to avoid financial collapse.<br>  <br>  As always I hoped this helped|`|SGwkPy62aa	It is not that America is going to survive as a nation, but that Americans are going to survive as people.  See, Obama is going to destroy America, he has already fast tracked it for destruction and financial take over by foreign countries, but Obama has not broken the spirit of the people, and no matter how hard he and this administration try, they will never break the spirit of true Americans.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Eventually every nation falls, or at least falls off its pedestal.

However, the human cost of that happening is something I find appalling. So many good, hard working people who have put up with privation, poor health care and sub standard housing will be the first to suffer. They will suffer the most and for the longest. The wealthy, who caused the crisis will simply jump in the lear jets, guarded by their private security and eff off to more amenable places.<br>  <br>  This is so unfair.It is a massive human tradgedy waiting to unfold I would like to see the world band together and help the US....not for the animals who caused the downfall of the economy...but for their victims...the American working class.|`|uzf7nuLnaa	This country is in trouble because our one political party is in control right now.  The liberals have united in one party and they control everything while the conservatives are fractured into several parties but together are more than half the population.  An unhappy population.  That spells civil unrest if too much is shoved down their throats at one time.  That appears to be on the verge of happening and the democrats are too drunk with power to see it coming.  I hope it all ends peacefully but I'm beginning to doubt it.|`|yKLBdoigaa	One thing is for sure, if America goes down, many other countries that rely on our imports and exports will go down with us. While I'm trying to avoid being the typical egotistical American who believes the world revolves around the USA... it is sort of the economic truth that as much as we rely on the assets of our allies, our allies rely on the assets in the United States.<br>  <br>  If you think the homeless situation is bad here, you should try traveling to ANY third world. <br>  <br>  Yes, unemployment is horrible, but do we have Americans fleeing to Mexico for jobs now? No, it's still the other way around.<br>  <br>  Negativity gets you no where but further in the hole.

Bush illegally invaded and occupied and destroyed a sovereign nation which never lifted a finger against the United States.<br>  <br>  President Obama is opening dialogue with the MODERATE members of the Taliban because they are now stronger than ever, thanks to George W. Bush attacking Afghanistan and starting a war, then he went off to play golf. Resulting in absolute chaos and destruction in Afghanistan, where criminals and opium warlords essentially took over. Now, with opium trading and profits HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN because there was no Taliban to keep them in check, the Afghanistan people were more than willing to allow the Taliban to step in and apply order once again.<br>  <br>  The Taliban is stronger than it was BEFORE bush invaded, and here is just one more mess that President Obama is going to have to try to clean up.<br>  <br>  You know - Bush ignored North Korea for eight years.

Not only did Clinton significantly deregulate mortgage loans as a means of gaining short term popularity, but he also helped to kill US industry with NAFTA, which allowed products made in areas where there were not such strong labor laws and environmental laws to be sold in the USA.  Because these products were made so much more cheaply they undercut the products made in US factories.  If you actually bother to think about it, it doesn't exactly take a brain surgeon to figure out that this  cannot continue without very significant financial repercussions.  The problem is most people didn't bother to think far enough ahead and see what was coming.  All they saw was that Clinton got them a nice house and nice things for a lot cheaper.  Yes, the Republicans have made some poor decisions over the years but if you look at the long term repercussions of governmental policy the Democrats have consistently been worse for the US.  Four years ago the liberals were condemning Bush for how fast the deficit was growing, and now somehow because it's a democrat wasting money on pork it's a good thing.  Let me make it perfectly clear.  Obama and his liberal dominated government is exploding the deficit much faster than Bush ever did, and there is so much blatant pork in the spending that will never actually help the economy recover that there is no realistic way anyone can defend their behavior.  You elected him, you take responsibility for him!<br>  <br>  PS: You claim that the supposed liberal bias in the media is GOP lie, but the fact is that the media has repeatedly crucified Republican presidents and praised Democratic presidents for the exact same action.  Obama's spending is the most recent example of this.  He is on track to double or triple the deficit, and Bush was blamed repeatedly by the media for increasing it by much smaller amounts.  Where is the media attack on Obama?|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	Here is the deal. He has a Huge spending plan that is bigger then the deficit that he started with.  When are you going to get it through your head that that is the problem.  That is why people are not investing.  The idea of the government having control of the banks scare people.  The spreading the wealth BS scares people.  Also the congress was run by Democrats for the past 2 years.

That cost the bank millions.<br>  <br>  But then again, I believe at the time, 5/3 was run by a former West Pointer.<br>  <br>  More people need to tell the government where to put it.<br>  <br>  And, finally, what makes you think you are so "elite?"<br>  <br>  edit: Most of the "bad paper" is in states with a large number of illegals.

56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	When our great country was founded, I doubt there were many liberals on hand.  Since liberals started poking their noses in where it does not belong, they have been steadily ruining this country.  I mean look at Pelosi, one of the biggest liberals I know.  Is this the type of crazy people we want changing our lives? <br>   Put them on a boat, push it out to sea and let them land on an island somewhere where they can pass all the laws they want.  They can have all the illegal immigrants, gays and lesbians, tree huggers, anti-war protestors, condom machines, marsh mice, abortions, ban guns, have welfare for everyone, keep the poor dependent on them for survival, ban religion, make it illegal to say the Pledge of Allegiance and prayers in school, ban all mention of God from money, and I could go on and on.  Oh and let them take the Civil Liberties Union with them.  Thank you!|`|ss393Fuiaa	Educated and Republican don't mix. Not saying there aren't smart people on both sides. Like John McCain, he's a smart guy that I just don't agree with. Obama is an idiot that I don't agree with. But I can't equate Republican with smart while Rush Limbaugh is still alive. He has enough idiocy for the whole party, so much that it spills to the Democrats. And no its not the Dems that are destroying the nation, its both of them, working together to ruin it. The Elitists puppet string holders are the ones ruining the country.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	I have a masters degree that says you are completely wrong.  In fact, I find that most conservatives, even when highly educated, most often choose not to exercise their cogitative capability.|`|zb2EwgKVaa	They are gonna come at you with weighted statistics that say states with large business centers are liberal even though the majority of the population in those states are in the cities with poor education.|`|AA10057192	Would the US be better off without emancipation, votes for women and ethnic minorities, public education, libraries, police and fire departments, labor unions, protections for consumers, and so on and so forth? As for republicans being more educated you should know that this is one of those touchy subjects...<br>  <br>  Higher education correlates with voting for Democrats, but it also correlates with higher incomes... which in turn correlate with voting for Republicans. It's a bit of a conundrum.|`|911851b2b251a8cb71cb5ba956d76d89aa	no more rich members of society are Replubicans because of their greed and desire to keep their personal wealth.  No matter if it is liberal or conservative you need another voice opposing you to keep your views in check so that either side doesn't go crazy when they are in power.  The problem is when the sides get caught up playing b.s politics or helping big corporations that bribe them bend the rules instead of actually debating helpful policies.|`|IWlPfk1raa	Then you wouldn't of had some of the best presidents of all time. Example President Lincoln, though he was a Republican he was a radical liberal abolishing slavery does that seem like it would of been a conservatives point of view in the 1860's? Thoguh the  war was actually faught to preserve the Union so only to an extent is liberalism a plus.|`|kiyVz23Jaa	Well I definitley think there should be a healthy balance of both. But if the democrats were in charge and held most of the majority like they do now it would be.....well like it is now.<br>  <br>  I agree, the democratic politicians today are forcing this country to come to an end almost so that they can enforce socialism. They want to prove democracy does not work, so they are forcing it to fail.|`|448c7a6cdc78d3a797b7c58c25d1ff56aa	Incorrect.

No I think you're very wrong on that part. The world would have been better off if the US was never created..|`|zFexpRTIaa	Of course not. Most of my professors are liberals and they are definitely educated.

I don't see too many highly educated people there...|`|78z7gk7naa	It matters, for who? For Liberals not really, but for conservatives I bet they'll think its great.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I think the US would be better if everyone was tolerant, open minded, and respectful to everybodies political view.<br>  <br>  But it seems like that'll never happen.|`|uW8U5T8Jaa	A lot less crime, illegal immigrants and people on welfare.|`|BLbNhcwYaa	H*** YES!!!!!

iTetA3oCaa	I did not vote for Obama or a socialist government.  I would really like to see a candidate who is willing to limit government to its proper function.  We have not had one since Reagan.  I listened to Obama and I realized that at best he would represent the Chicago Mafia and great big government and at the worst the Muslims.  His actions in illegally paying off the Dems was totally predictable.  Government can give you nothing they do not take from someone else.  The government is totally anti productive.|`|27sSI5wxaa	I voted for him because he's the best person for the job.<br>  <br>  And I was right.<br>  <br>  And I have no regrets.<br>  <br>  next...|`|fxFYyzBbaa	Because you and your pathetic and dishonest party are a world JOKE. I cannot believe you would even admit you were a Republican.|`|cDaxALCFaa	Well, lets see, Capitalism has failed us and throwing in some aspects of mild socialism wouldn't kill us.  We already have socialized mail service, library service, police offices, fire companies, etc.. and we don't complain about them. <br>  <br>  I voted for Obama because he was clearly the more intelligent of the two candidates. He had a plan and he was actually going to do something in favor of American's when he was in office and he did.
u800erMFaa	God Bless america...God Bless President Obama   Down with Fox News and  Rush  who hate America and is attempting to divide and tear us apart! Rush is hoping America fails ,he has said so many times that means the stock market , jobs , You  and ME... United we stand, .Apart we shall fall .. we WILL get thru this but first we must  hit bottom before  we  can get better , there will be  much pain & sacrifice. Bush should stand trial along with his fat cat financial  and  oil rich buddies for the evil wrongdoings he has done to our country It  is plain as the nose on your face that President Obama inherited this mess from the Republican trickle down Bush  administration and is fighting with all his might to get this country back on track! I have nothing but praise and admiration for President Obama .. He is the only one with integrity, honor, morals , strength  with fantastic reasoning and decision making powers. Obama is the only one I trust.. He will go down in history as one of, if not the very Best President we have Ever had~|`|4qT0TfMZaa	What's obvious to me is that by pretending the present economic disaster is Obama's fault and not that of the Repugnicans, you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you suffer from a terminal case of rectocranial inversion!|`|418d2e9812dceb72c6c1d038184e789baa	Pretty much. Tech stocks will be the next to bottom.<br>  <br>  Obama has said several times that he will put main street ahead of wall street. To me, I think he does not realize that Americans have their retirement accounts in the stock market.<br>  <br>  Also, he doesn't realize that many charitable foundations depend on high stock values and dividends to function. And his lack of care goes along with his idea to start taxing charitable contributions. <br>  <br>  Removing tax deductions for charitable contributions is essentially saying that Americans should not help the poor. He must think helping the poor is the job of the "nanny state" that he wants to make the U.S. into.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	If it isn't obvious it should be. A quick glance at some of his earliest interviews would show a devastated market is EXACTLY what he wants....to do as you say - implement his agenda. What did Emanuel say?

It is just one way he will attempt to level the playing field between the contributors/useful and the noncontributors/useless|`|todJGCP8aa	Where was this rant when the market started falling under Bush? If you think this crisis be\gan 1/20/09, you are seriously mistaken|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Obama does care. He wants to destroy America and is telling us to not pay attention until it is too late.|`|0ZPABvh8aa	I am NOT an Obama fan but the stock market was always going to tailspin, maybe not this badly but it still would have done, certainly before Obama did his bit no one had predicted a low like this but they still predicted a continuing low. We had reached a point of no return and this depression had to run its course and then we would recover which we will and always do. But because politicians like to be reelected and because Obama  has some ideology that he was insistent on putting into practice we have spent trillions and trillions and whilst we would have recovered from this depression anyway, now we will have the legacy of this spending frenzy for many years to come when doing nothing at all would have had the same effect but with less of a debt. Things will get better but it will be inspite of Obama not because of him  and it might take twice as long as it should have done, but it will improve.|`|AA11289359	Yes that is the answer blame it on Bush even though we have had a democratic run government for two years now and during that time it has been going down and down and down.<br>  Now with a new democratic president and in control of both houses what do we see now more and more spending, bills that Bush vetoed because of pork or to much cost are now being pushed right on through without any concern as to what it may do to the country. All I can say is they better hurry up and get their bills in before the masses of people here in America wake up and see what is really going on.|`|gRfqjemmaa	It will not matter what happens to stocks, the country, the world for that matter.

He ignores the stock market just like Rush Limbaugh, the new head of the republican party, ignores the overriding majority the US population who can't stand him.<br>  <br>  Keep going with Rush!!! He's so low in the Gallop & Field polls, it isn't even funny. 80% OF REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, AND MODERATES CAN'T STAND HIM!  YOU'LL NEVER GET THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THOSE STATS, BABY!<br>  <br>  GO, RUSH, GO!! AND MAKE SURE ALL THE SENATORS KISS YOUR TOES & KEEP APOLOGIZING TO YOU IN FRONT OF THE FOX NEWS CAMERAS!!  <br>  <br>  YOU'RE THE MAN!!|`|W3pTE0cVaa	Obama has been our President for a grand total of 48 days ONLY. It seems ilogical to place blame on him for the situations we are facing with our countries financial institutions, economy, environment, healthcare and our military. There is no logical explaination, nor reasonable arguement for blaming him for causing America to be in this current state.<br>  Anyone being honest, and possessing an intelect beyond of a 1st grader must surely have to give the responsibility for America's present problems with the man that just handed Obama the Precidency after having spent 8 years putting America and Americans at risk. <br>  If you don't like the man for whatever reason, at least have the self respect to say it. But blaming him after 48 days for the mess that  Bush spent his  2920 days in office making is both ignorant and absurd.<br>  Anyone that claims to be patriotic, a proud American, etc. Should want the best for our country, period. Regardless of who the president is or from which party he comes to us from. We should want OUR PRESIDENT to suceed.. We as a whole should be looking towards a better tomorrow rather than creating ill feelings, and unrest through irrational and inane statements like the title to this question.<br>  Seriously give the man a chance before you condemn him. Fair is fair. We gave Bush 8 years. <br>  And if you insist on hating the man before you know what he is about then at least have the backbone to be honest about the true reason for your dislike of the man.|`|beO40ap7aa	no, it was in a tailspin when bush left, and Obamas group knew it would get a lot worse before it got better, it has yet to hit bottom.|`|jVUEohsNaa	He doesn't undersand it, he is over his head.<br>  <br>  NOBAMA!

2lFRYr8Eaa	Nothing.  You are allowed to plead not guilty, and later change it.  There is no punishment for saying not guilty.  The fact is that under our rule, you are innocent until proven guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	If you admit then there is no point to a trial and your sentence MIGHT be tone down.<br>  <br>  If you lie then there will be a trial to prove if you are telling the truth or not. Your sentence might also be increased if your proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Well first, you plead guilty or not guilty. You don't plead innocent. <br>  And anyone with any sense at all will plead not guilty, regardless of whether or not they are guilty, because the burden of proof lies with the state. They have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that you are guilty, so it serves no benefit to the defendant to plead guilty. <br>  <br>  The reason goes beyond whether or not a person is actually guilty. Without the system the way it is, then people who are innocent, but coerced into admitting guilt would never have a chance. The reason the prosecution has to prove guilt is to help prevent innocent people from being punished for crimes they did not commit. In fact, in many cases, a not guilty plea is automatic in the arraignment phase. This is basically the court acknowledging that the prosecution has to prove it's case. It is not about lying so much as it is about making the system work for everyone as best we can. <br>  <br>  The system is far from perfect, and innocent people still DO get incarcerated, but if the prosecution didn't have to do more to prove their case than get a confession, it would be far, far worse. Contrary to popular belief (and, actually, beliefs that the courts encourage, since they are so overbooked, that they try to rush cases through with plea deals, sometimes to the detriment of the defendant and to society as a whole), the prosecutor does NOT go easier on you if you plead guilty at your arraignment. They do not even make an offer until you've stood before the judge and said guilty or not guilty.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	It is all about the District Attorney.  If you declared yourself NOT Guilty.  He might want to take you to court to prove you, otherwise.<br>  If you claim guilty..He will go easy on sentencing or recommending the sentence to the judge.  That is why your lawyer will negotiate with the D.A. for a lighter sentence if you guilty.|`|398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	Pleading guilty says "Hey, I did it, I accept responsibility for my actions and I'm willing to accept the punishment."<br>  <br>  Not guilty means you either didn't do it or you're not admitting it.  Sometimes it's used to take time to negotiate a plea bargain.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	A plead is neither a truth nor a lie. It is a legal response to an accusation. A plea of innocent to an accusation of which one is guilty is simply a challenge that the accuser need to prove the charge.

I6dcRgD6aa	everything. He knows our country was as toxic as any drug addict or person who needs to be healed from a deadly disease. Something was draining us. I will use diabetes as the metaphor (hopefully you know about diabetes & what it does to the body) Diabetes have trouble circulation cause the sugar just pours throught them & down the toilet. So they don't have any real sweetness left. They get tired & burned out. There feet stop getting blood (this is like our poor stop getting money) It gets worst & worst. They can end up having the feet cut off which is like us cutting off our foundation & not being able to stand. Obama has said CHANGE & I know that when a person is doing all that is wrong, not eating healthy, on time. exercising, the last thing they want to do is change. It feels terrible. I was a diabetic. I wanted to die rather than stop eating my junk food but though a number of years by working at it against what I really wanted to do. I did it. Cause I love others around me. So I did the right thing so I could detox my body of fat (I wasn't very big but our debt is like a heavy weight that has to be taken care of the same way an obese person has to take care of fat) So we are not in the stage of denial & shock for some who are losing their jobs & homes. Look up the stages of grief. We are going through that but we will have a resurection if we are willing to more towards the light. If you are watching Fox or listening to Limbaugh start detoxing the right wing media first. If you can't see what they are doing to you, you will have to at some point to recover.

ACYf88mPaa	In respect to our new president I think he should be call President Obama. All of the other presidents have had the respect as our president; why should President Barack Obama be any different? Give him a chance, we may be surprised by what he can accomplish for our country. The United States of America is supposed to be the land of freedom and I think giving President Obama a chance to show this country what he's got is the respect he deserves after all the hard work he's done already through his years in politics. I was raised to believe that "White People are Better and More Dominant" but those lessons that my sadly closed minded family never stuck with me. I believe the color of the skin shouldn't hold back a bright person from achieving greatness and I strongly believe President Obama deserves our respect and our support from the country that he has already worked so hard for in his short life.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	For some reason or other, I prefer Barry.|`|AA10287332	Doesn't bother me at all.

The current approach acheives little and consumes a great deal of resources in the process. The Jihad steadliy gained momentum commencing with 911, if the American government is more open to peiceful resolution the Jihad may decline, which is good for everyone. There are without doubt risks with this but all approaches come with risk. There will allways be a small core group of extremists who live and die to harm America (and its allies) but perhaps with a slight shift in thinking some of the young men who take up in terrorist training camps may choose another direction.

Even voicing the thought of thinking people should have one is akin to having a gun illegally. Of course, the real reason, The one they won't say, is - they don't want people to fight back against someone who is evil.

If you're getting a medical waiver then you've still got a shot as they haven't put new restrictions on medical waivers.  It's also dependent upon what your educational credentials are.  If you're a high school diploma they'll allow for more than a GED but not as much as a bachelor etc..  None of the services are in need and all of them have made it a lot more difficult to get in.

That alone should expose their hypocrisy at wanting things fair.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	when the fairness doctrine was initiated in the early part of the 20th century, radio was just starting to Blossom with no regulation. stations didn't have specific freq's and would overlap. this was a way to ensure at the time that all viewpoints were expressed. tv didn't provide what it does today either so this was another reason. once the fcc started regulating freq's and stations these problems started to subside. the doctrine today is actually not needed because of all the media sources available. one reason the left wants it back today is they just can't get a grip on this medium due to the fact their shows don't generate the listeners that draw advertisers. being is this is a free enterprise system, it goes back to who makes money and who doesn't. the 'doctrine' will not be brought back in it's current form because the powers that be know the citizens won't stand for it. they will however slid this in via the backdoor and regulate the local stations which will in effect wipe out talk radio. unfortunately this is exactly what the left wants in the guise of "Fairness" it's an attack only on one medium and it's clear as day what they want to do....as far as fairness or censorship...what do you think??? this is not rocket science.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	Its only fair if obama wants it, if he can get this  its  another sign of socialism  and  gov  take over  they  want control  of  banks  health care  and  radio  and  be  able  to  tell  us  when  where  and  how,  wake  up  america   we  do  not  want  that|`|GHPZlhAwaa	First of all Free Speech does NOT mean that you can say anything to anyone at anytime and have the right ot get away with it.  You have the right to say anything you want, but you are RESPONSIBLE for the results of your words.  You can not incite a crowd to violence or irresponsible harm.  You can not make false statements about people without being held accountable for defamation of character.  In reality,  there is no such thing as free speech, except for the media who can legally, after the 1965 New York Times v Sullivan decision, do anything that they want and not be held accountable. <br>  <br>  The Fairness Doctrine sounds perfectly reasonable, that equal time should be given to opposing views, however, it is only being proposed for certain radio stations.  This is not going to make purveyors of truth out of CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, NPR or any of the liberal media, this is aimed at forcing radio stations to air unprofitable liberal talk shows along side profitable Conservative talk shows or forcing the removal of a portion of or all of the conservative talk shows.<br>  <br>  The reason that conservative talk shows are profitable has nothing to do with content alone, the reason talk radio is profitable is that conservatives can not listen to the "Main Stream Media" and get unbiased reporting of the news, so they turn to radio stations that have conservative hosts who will give them the news either without bias or with the bias that prefer.<br>  <br>  Air America doesn't work because there are so many other places for liberals to get the news with the bias that they prefer, so nobody listens and hence nobody advertises and the stations are unprofitable and go out of business.<br>  <br>  whale|`|iehpzIQBaa	If America wants to remain free we must tolerate all speech<br>  <br>   Not delete somebody's account on YA for example<br>  <br>   Anyway fairness is anybody can say anything and the citizens responsibility is to be Intelligent enough to understand what is being said<br>  <br>   It is a citizens responsibility to take care of their children BTW not the publics|`|gWX21Jtwaa	Fair does not have any thing to do with it.<br>  <br>  It is a way to keep the people down.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Fairness Doctrine is censorship.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	My answer would probably violate the fairness doctrine and worse, violate Yahoo.<br>  <br>  So, I refuse to answer that as it may incriminate me.<br>  <br>  Actually, the Fairness Doctrine only applies to the party out of power.<br>  They are not allowed to criticize the ones in power.<br>  <br>  Hitler and Stalin were firm believers in that.

Can you imagine if you were a cop and pulled someone over and they would not cooperate, they have a warrant out for their arrest when you go to cuff them they start fighting you, all the while they have a load of drugs in them?  I have seen cops shoot someone 7 or 8 times, it doesn't faze the person.   If the person is not in the wrong and the cops over step their bounds, it is sad he/she should be punished, as for the bigger part when the cops stops someone, they usually do find a problem.

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	I'm gonna take a wild guess what side you are on in this.<br>  <br>  Holding captured territory is a political, not a military issue.  Nuff said.  <br>  <br>  WWI was started by a Serb in Bosnia.  The U.S. and NATO allies were tryiing to prevent Serbia from a war of agression that could start a wider war in Europe again.|`|jbAr62ybaa	You've asked several questions; but neglected several important ones:<br>  <br>  1) why was it started: justified, or outright agression, strictly for territorial gain - or for other illegitimate purposes?<br>  <br>  2) legal? according to whose laws?<br>  <br>       The balkan conflict you reference, was an out right act of aggression on Serbia's part, primarily for the purpose of ethnic cleansing - to exterminate the muslims.<br>  <br>       If I'm not mistaken(correct me if I'm), the U.S. became involved because of our NATO commitments: that's legal cover as far as I'm concerned. <br>  <br>       "They(we)intervened in Bosnia, why not in Rawanda?"  Very good question in my perspective.  <br>  <br>       Bottom line, there's no vital, stragetic nor economic interests involved as far as this country or any of the European are concerned.  The Western powers only give "lip service", relating to humanitarin values.<br>  <br>       In my view, the Iraq invasion and war, will eventully turn out to be the biggest, historical military blunder in this nation's history.  <br>  <br>       And historically, Bush will be remembered as one of if not the worst Presidents this country has ever had; in addition to being the most inept, incompetent and downright most stupid one.<br>  <br>       When and if our troops pull out to any substantial degree, all h*ll's going to break out; and things there will revert back to square one: only with Saddam no longer participating.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	IF there is a custody agreement in place stating that you have residential custody and he kept her beyond the time allotted, then that was parental kidnapping.  BUT if there was no court order in place, then he has an equal right to possession of his child.  <br>  <br>  That being said, if he can't show up in court because he was/is on probation, that is not going to look good.  You need to document his extensive criminal past (especially violent crimes) and get your lawyer (you do have a lawyer, right?) to claim that he is unfit to retain custody on the grounds of moral turpitude (see link below), or on whatever grounds your lawyer sees fit.  I doubt he will be granted custody.  Further, since he has crimes of violence on his record, I would ask for any visitation awarded to him be "supervised".<br>  <br>  One last thing....make sure you take a lawyer to court with you.....you really need one.  If you can't afford it, contact the court now and ask for help in getting a lawyer (you may need to contact legal aid).<br>  <br>  Good luck...and please let us know what happens!  I care!|`|IUXriZQJaa	It is hard to convince a magistrate that you can make responsible choices caring for a child if you have made irresponsible choices which brought you a criminal record, especially if there are many such choices.<br>  <br>  Refusal to return the child (de-facto kidnapping), criminal background and demonstrable instability are grounds to question parental fitness.<br>  <br>  <br>  Choose the child's next father figure more carefully.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	Of course it is viewed as negative...and him keeping her behind state lines and not returning her when agreed apon will prove devastating to him.  IT takes ALOT for a judge to take away custody from the biological mother, if you have a clean past, you will likely win.  Then get a restraining order against him...<br>  <br>  If he fails to make it to court( which on probation he has to notify his pobation officer of the court date, and since he is required to show up in court, there will be exceptions made.,usually the probation officer will escort him to the court hearing)..and you win custody, that judge can put out a warrent out on his name for failure to appear, and the police can go arrest him and return your daughter to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FehqgF3Saa	i was in drug court for 3 years recently. during that time i got to see many individuals struggle with custody issues either with other parent or DHS--the State, from what i have seen the Judge looks at what you have been doing for the past 6months- to 1 1/2years. what have you done to change yourself for the better, taking parenting classes can go a long way in your favor. there is always something new to learn to improve you as a parent.  learning is lifelong. instead of stressing and focusing on what he is or has done wrong, put more light on what you are CURRENTLY doing right.<br>  Good Luck|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Ok, first, yes his criminal history will certainly be a factor, particularly the violence. And if he doesn't show up, regardless of the reason, and doesn't have an attorney there in his place, things will likely not turn out well for him. If he is on probation, and refusing to return your daughter, than you should speak to your attorney about asking the judge for sole custody, and then having his PO accompany you to take custody of your daughter. Some other things that may come up:<br>  Did you bring her to him? That would indicate a lack of fear on your part as it pertains to his parenting; not a good thing. <br>  How long has she been with him?<br>  Do you have custody of her on paper? At all?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a competent attorney, and you should be able to get primary or sole custody as long as you can show that you can provide a stable and loving home, and he cannot.

b1C3xs3Jaa	The war on sugar, and fatty foods, and loud music is worth fighting. <br>  <br>  Your body, is my property. So violence (government) should be used to MAKE you do whatever I (a politician or voter) says.<br>  <br>  I have seen first hand what happens to men, women, and children from eating too much sugar and fat. They gain weight, get slow both physically and mentally, and often take on distorted human forms that closer resemble jello piles. They cannot stop themselves.<br>  <br>  We need to use violence (govenrment) to keep the food from their lips. Yes they want to eat, but we must dictate their diets since they cannot choose what we feel is right for them to eat.<br>  <br>  We should raid their homes, and take their cars and property if they are caught buying fatty foods or candybars in them - the police can sell the stolen property and enrich the police state.<br>  <br>  We should confiscate the money and children of those who eat unhealthy, or sleep too much, or listen to loud music, or eat too much salt or mcdonalds or watch too much tv.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, they should all be thrown into prison. Their body shouldn't do things I don't like. <br>  <br>  I don't care if there is a victim or not, there WILL be a victim once the state is done with them!<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  <br>  In all reality, I ask one thing.<br>  <br>  Where is the victim?<br>  <br>  The vistim must be real, and not theoretical, because there can be theoretical victims to ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.<br>  <br>  If someone has not harmed ones body or property, then no crime has been committed.

Look at the opium dens of the 1800s, they weren't a pretty place to visit.  Look at people who happily use meth, they look like they've aged 35 years in 6 months and that's just cosmetically, otherwise, they can't function in life.  Look at Brett Favre, that guy was taking Vicoden, he was never arrested...Physically, he was a world class specimen.   But it got harder to take his pills, his body rejected them, he puked um up, and then he would rinse them off and take them again.  And one night, when everyone thought nothing was wrong, he nearly died.  The seizures were bad, doctors saved his life.  And this was a world class athlete taking a prescription drugs.  <br>  <br>  We aren't smart enough to be chemist for our own bodies and we don't have the will power to control it.  The war is worth fighting, it would be a horrible loss to give up.  We just need to do it better.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	Let's see what the War on Drugs has created so far: More violence, overcrowding prisons with non-violent drug offenders, more taxes, more drug dealers, and more loss of rights under the name of "security".<br>  <br>  What has the War on Drugs prevented?

Look what happened to the Chinese when Opium was introduced to their culture.   The odd thing is that I use to work with Heroin addicts, and think more highly of them , then the Marijuana users.   I've seen some really strange behavior from pot users.   They're far more annoying.   I use to talk to a former Meth addict, and she was horrified on what it did to her, looking back at her former life.   In the case of Marijuana use, according to Lancet (An English medical journal), there is a strong connection with marijuana use, and psychological problems.   The question is if the marijuana cause these people to acquire these problems or that the psychological problems is what makes people turn to marijuana. So I have to say, that I am not sure all those annoying pot users I hate would not be jerks if they weren't using pot.|`|gOF1wJLFaa	Of course not.<br>  <br>  It is senseless. All making drugs illegal does is create crime. It causes needless murders. If drugs were legal, people would not have to murder each other over disputes about them. It costs so much tax payer money for our lawmakers to write these laws, so much tax payer money to send police out to enforce the laws, and so much tax payer money to jail all of our newly created criminals. <br>  <br>  The "war on drugs" is just a way for politicians to try to look good. Most of them use drugs themselves.|`|mFInMKSaaa	I think everyone needs to get the hell out of everyone elses business.<br>  Why is it that all you hear anymore is people trying to fix things.

The price of cocaine has gone down, thanks to the crack bubble. The price of comparable marijuana has remained stable, and the availability of higher quality marijuana has gone out the roof. The vacuum of power in Afghanistan when we invaded Iraq drove the worldwide price of heroin through the floor, which proved more effective in bringing it here than our coast guard did in stopping it.<br>  The basic fact of the matter is that when there is a healthy black market, government bans have two effects on a market. They make the profits for sellers higher (allowing them to purchase other detrimental things, like black market guns), and the government loses out on tax revenue, which could be used for treatment (which has proven a less costly method of eliminating the scourge of drugs) or other purposes (as the tax dollars from cigarettes generally go to, like roads). This mostly ignores the societal burdens of the WoD, measured in cost of life (police, DEA, Coast Guard, civilian bystanders, and that's only in America), which could be used for more purposeful means (fighting terror, slowing illegal immigration), to say nothing of what it does to their families.<br>  <br>  I have yet to hear a real case for the continued war other than "drugs are bad", which I agree with, but doesn't cut to the point.|`|L22rN8Wiaa	There is no such thing as the war on drugs.<br>  There is only disenfranchisement of low income, inner-city population.  The prison system is greatly support by the incarceration of this group.  The people who really profit from the drug industry are living lavish lifestyles with the help of those who are supposed to be part of the war on drugs.  These same "drug fighters" introduces a significant amount of drugs into the inner-cities to intentionally increase the usage and addiction.
1a10b6b1127b07e424d93d828a3444d8aa	1) Would you consider you had the same right to marry if you HAD to marry someone of the same gender even though you prefer the opposite gender?  How would you have the same right to marry who you love and want to spend the rest of your life with if you were forced to do so with a person that you have no attraction/desire/romantic love for?<br>  <br>  2) Calling gay marriage a civil union is seperate but equal which we have already proved is NOT equal so yes this is a civil rights issue.  What if atheists were forced to call their marriages a "psychological partnership" because religious people wanted to keep marriage as religious only? Also fun fact...every "argument" against gay marriage is the same argument used to prevent the legalization of inter-faith and inter-racial marriages.<br>  <br>  3) Techincally the government should have no say in the social organization of any family or romantic relationship...aka the govt has no right to be in the bedroom.  The only reason govt has any access to marriage at all is because of the legal/property/tax issues.  The idea of 2 person marriage did not come from gay advocates but long ago from those who deemed polygamy was discriminatory to women who could marry 1 man while man could marry multiple women.

Unfortunately, because Bush got distracted by Iraq, he took badly needed resources out of Afghanistan to fight a needless war in Iraq.  During the last 7 years, the Taliban have taken back huge portions of Afghanistan.  Remember also, that Afghanistan is a very large country.  We simply do not have the resources, particularly amid our current financial crisis, to continue fighting the Taliban.  <br>  <br>  One of the only possible quick ends to the Afghanistan conflict is to negotiate with the Taliban.  Otherwise, they will continue to terrorize Afghanistan.  Because they are a smaller more dispersed force of people, they will continue to slip through our fences of soldiers and get behind our lines and kill U.S. soldiers and Afghanistan's citizens.  Unfortunately, while this might be a good way for the U.S. to bow gracefully out of Afghanistan (or rather, shamelessly, if you will) it will certainly mean pain and death for the women and many other people of Afghanistan.  <br>  <br>  I think we spilled the milk and we need to stick around and properly clean it all up.

As early as the 1930's communism's stated goal was control of the media such as the movies and the newspapers, and control of the education system and they have been successful.  We are turning out a bunch of lazy flaming liberals and a few of them become more conservative when they actually go to work and start getting the bill for all that government does for them and to them.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	The people were scared of Russia's nuclear arsenal and [perceived] aggression, generally not their ideological differences.  What American Conservatives were successfully able to do is to turn that fear into political advantage.  They established themselves as the opposite of the feared enemy, therefore to disagree with them on anything was anti-American.  The 'with us or against us' mentality is an absurd oversimplification, but it sure worked.<br>  <br>  George W. Bush and co. were successfully able to use that strategy after September 11th.  It's not that most people agreed with him ideologically or understood the complexities of Middle Eastern relations, there were just scared of 'terrorists'.  He was able to use that fear to defeat his rivals and push through his entire agenda.|`|zjpB2GARaa	McCarthy's targets were almost all genuine communists (as the records of the USSR have confirmed) and merely lost their careers as a result.<br>  <br>  At the core of McCarthyism was a desire to payback the leftists who had slandered principled right-wingers during WWII as "fascists" (however, the claims that right-wingers were "fascist" were completely false, while the claims that many prominent leftists of those days were members of the Communist Party was absolutely true).  Right-wingers were trying to protect Americans from being enslaved under Communism.  Of course, many McCarthyites at the time saw Communism as an ideological threat to explain away and eliminate from the government rather than a military threat that needed to be destroyed through war (for example, the right-wing was very strongly opposed to the Korean War), but following the fall of McCarthyism, the right-wing began to desire war with communism instead.  McCarthyism led to the addition to the right of devoutly religious people who wanted to stop "godless" Communism, which was vital in transforming the right-wing from a movement for free markets, liberty, and "Isolationist" foreign policy into the threat to liberty that it has become.<br>  <br>  The right-wing did not identify themselves as "conservative" until the rise of National Review (following the downfall of McCarthy).  Prior to that, the right-wing was basically in opposition to the tyrannical policies of the FDR Democrats (including their warmongering).  Of course, the "right" of those days had been Jefferson-Jackson-Cleveland Democrats (such as the 1928 nominee of the Democrats Al Smith) who believed that FDR was taking the Democratic Party of Jefferson, Jackson and Cleveland, down the road of Marx, Engels, and Stalin.<br>  <br>  Following the self-destruction of the right, the term "conservative" began to be used by the new "respectable" right-wing.

But, the 2nd Recon Battalion (Division Recon)  has created a Force Recon Company, to perserve the deep recon assets to MAGTF.  But this Force Recon Company will no longer provide direct action since the MSPF have assumed the role.  Which is great!

The Mexican border is dangerous because marijuana is illegal and the drug cartel are making billions off it and using the profits for more violence and murder! The Mexican drug cartels would be out of business over-night with marijuana being legalized in the U.S. It could have the same rules and restrictions as alcohol consumption and there would be penalties for misuse and those under 21 years of age using it illegally!

Marijuana is very beneficial in my opinion, if you want to talk about something that ruins peoples lifes lets talk about pain killers, lets talk about alcohol, lets talk about heroin, meth, cocaine and all the other drugs that have been proven to kill people. Do you know anyone who has overdosed while smoking Marijuana? Do you hear stories about people who've smoked a joint and start killing people? I do not smoke Marijuana but I have many reasons to defend it. It can help with pain and if you ask me that's a hell of a lot better than giving someone a bottle of vicodin. It can help with eating disorders. It can help with an anger problem. It can help with ADHD. I don't even smoke weed and I know that it can be helpful in other peoples lifes. I really get tired of people saying It's a "gateway" drug. And that it can ruin lifes. I have no faith in our Government. Why should alcohol be legalized over Marijuana? It's proven to have much worse side effects.|`|F32uPjAraa	Absolutely, this plant is truly manna from heaven.

With that said, this is not just a matter of creating incentives for hiring, it's a matter of filling a massive gap in demand and rapidly spurring GDP growth. Direct government spending is the most effective way of doing this.

CwBVLFPTaa	I personally think there are more harmful things out there than weed that are perfectly legal. Weed is illegal for the same reason they have not  released the cure for AIDS or Cancer or any of the other major diseases to the general public. There's no money to be made in a drug that can cure a disease. The government makes more money selling us drugs that are supposed to cure one thing and in reality cause more problems causing us to have to go buy another drug. If weed really can do all of those things why would the government want to mess up their money flow that would almost be like putting a cure on the market??? Plus weed is illegal and people still find ways to get it  so it would be hard for the government to track sales and collect taxes. It kind of like how bootleg Cd's are illegal but people still have them. The music industry complains that it hurts their sales. As long as there is a way to get weed and the government has no way to control who makes and sells it, it will always be illegal. The government wants us to think that it's because of the harmful effects that weed has that makes it illegal. Complete bull!!! 3 things 1.) Think about it how many drugs do you know that don't have some sort of side effect??? 2.) Cigarettes are probably far more dangerous than weed but they are perfectly legal why...??? 3.) because how many "normal" people do you know that "grow" cigarettes in their backyard and then go out and try to sell them. Sales and taxes are easier to control with cigarettes and such . So basically it's a money issue when it comes down to it.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	You are looking at PRO USE sites.

Look at it this way ok, marijuana is easy to grow any one can grow it it does not require much attending to, cigarettes however evn if we can grow the tobacco we cannot manufacture it and we rely on the tobacoo companies to do this. Legalising marijuana, would endanger tobacco companies why pay for a smoke when you can grow it for free!It would be a financial loss to them big time. And it is known that the government has business affiliates so the government would make laws protecting companies. Also if legalised it would decrease trafficking and smuggling as a matter of fact that wont even be a crime.If legalised people would be encouraged to grow thier own without fear so again they wont need to buy dope on the streets. They say marijuana cause psychosis excuse me have they not seen the effects of alcohol and that is perfectly legal.Alcohol has more side effects that marijuana again the government making laws to protect alcohol companies by making it legal.Legalising it has more pros than cons

PKzE3AVBaa	Global economies don't work unless everyone has the same standard of living. You are right about the big business problem. A worker in the U.S. makes about $10 an hour while a worker in China makes $10 a day. Economically it makes sense to hire a china man. The U.S. government is tasked to tariff foreign products to make american workers competitive with " slave labor" wages. Favored nation status was demanded by socialist during the Clinton 1 presidency. No tariffs were put into place to protect american workers. Yes, Reagan, Bush 1&2 and even Carter agreed to the lack of tariffs. Our problem is politicians who get money for favors and say screw the workers of america.|`|OwlZ1Z1Yaa	because when you tax small business they have know chance to expand which would create jobs and grow the economy, common sense huh?|`|Rh5b4R5Iaa	Obama's policies will cause even more business' to relocate.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	The policy of taxing business is the main reason for the job loss.

fBwrBqtIaa	You want to join the Army but you want to be a SEAL i don't really understand that.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	First of all Navy seals are American, you want JTF2, doesn't sound as fancy but as good or better, much less publicized. Now if you really want to go that route Cadets are the only option to get any military exposure at 15. Wait until 18 then join regs without bothering with reserves first. To have any hope of getting to JTF 2standards you have to be the best at everything you do. Start with your physical condition. You should be in top shape right from the start then after 4 years you can apply for selection training. They only take the best of the best and if they even get the hint that you are a physco forget it.<br>  <br>  The reason I sugest you wait for 18 is to finish school and dont bother with reserves, most regs regard them as SAS, Saterday and Sunday soldiers, wana bees.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	The best way to plan your career in the Armed Forces..See a recruiter.

The best advice I can give you to make you a great candidate for future enlistment is join any extracurricular activity that develops your leadership potential.  It can be from Boys Scouts, Sports at school, community volunteering, JROTC in high school, civil air patrol, chess club, Future Business Leaders of America, volunteering in your church.  I know it may not be what you were expecting but trust me these will have the greatest influence on your future as a member of our military, although not necessary it will set you apart.  Another thing is to stay fit, and do well on your core classes such as math, English, and science.  Good luck and remember its never to early to start planning your future.|`|dp0cffjSaa	The best thing that you can do to prepare to enlist in the Armed Forces is to keep your body fit, stay out of trouble, do your best in school, and research the Armed Forces to make certain that your decision to join the military is the right one for you. If your school offers the JROTC program ("cadets"), that should definitely help you become acquired to a military environment. You mentioned joining the "reserves". You are too young to join the Reserves of any military branch. Reserves is still considered being in the military, and you must be at least 17 with parental consent.<br>  <br>  But, trust me, you'll get all of the training and preparation you'll need when you enlist in the Armed Forces. They'll physically and mentally prepare you for your career.<br>  <br>  In response to your additional details:<br>  I personally don't know much about the Navy, much less the Navy SEALS. But, good news is, I've found the PERFECT website that will answer every question I'm sure you have. It is the Navy's official website on their special forces, the Navy SEALS. Becoming a Navy SEAL is anything but easy. But, keep working towards your goal!

AA10083573	Why? Because many of our Americans live on the governments largess...receiving monthly disability & welfare checks so that they can sleep till noon and complain about those who make too much noise warming up their car at 5 am to get to work. As long as their government keeps the checks coming, they could care less what kind of government is in charge. I worked as a receptionist in a Social Services office and saw first-hand what the lack of a welfare check did to normally mild-mannered people. And heaven help the poor receptionist that got the full brunt of their anger as they demanded to know where their check went. Too many times, I wanted to tell them that it wasn't THEIR check...part of it was mine, in the form of my taxes. Pretty much, if you ask the average American who any of their reps, senators, or even their own governor is, you'd get a blank look. The way the government works is that they slowly get you used to getting lots of programs and so-called tax breaks. Then they tell you that you'll lose them unless they can take away certain freedoms. Many people would rather have their stuff than be concerned with the losses of something they can't put in their pocket. How many people would rather have their job back, even knowing that the company was bought out by Chinese investors? How many people will register their guns instead of losing them in a gun raid? We've already given up quite a few of our freedoms without realizing, or even caring about it. With the start of the barcode system back in the mid 70's, everything we buy can now be tracked. The strips in our currency can be tracked even in our pockets. There are cameras more & more on our streets. We're all told that it's to keep us safer. There was a book, called The Illuminati (by Larry Burkett [sp?]), that was written in the late 90's that spoke about all of these things. I didn't think much of the book, though it was exciting...until some of the things in the book came to pass. Many veterinarians can now inject a small computer chip into your pet, so that it can be tracked if your pet is lost. I'd heard talk about our prison system doing the same to certain inmates, so that they would never be able to hide. Also, that infants could have this done, so as to keep them from being mixed up with other babies in the hospital, or abducted by criminals. It's all in the guise of protecting us. I'd rather that our government just do what we hired them to do...defend & protect us from foreign powers, and to uphold our constitution. And keep their grubby little claws out of our pockets & lives. They've become too big for their britches. Yeah. <*)))><|`|kijIJbBxaa	They are willing to abandon freedom and independence because their  brains have been programmed with Hegelian Dialectic doublemind.

Because it concentrates all power in the hands of a tiny minority - them. <br>  <br>  The American Constitution limits Federal Authority to very narrowly defined areas. By making American law - and the Constitution - subordinate to a world government without those limits, any limit on what can be done at the whim of those controlling the government is removed. And by consolidating power, it becomes a weapon to quash any opposition. That was the method used in the Soviet Union to stifle dissent, and they want to import that system here.<br>  <br>  The main reason behind the pushes for the government to manage health care, housing, banking or anything else, is to ensure that the government has the means to quash any dissent. Once people are dependent on government managed 'entitlements', they must always fear being denied those entitlements if they object to anything the government does. <br>  <br>  Anyone willing to give up freedom for security deserves neither - and wont get the security they thought they were buying anyway - just subservience to tyranny.|`|AA11566315	the thing is that with their votes the American people turned the helm of the Government over to the most Liberal , Power hungry , Nut Case Politicians in History with very little or no Checks and Balances , Rich or Poor , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid and Barack Obama are going to change your life and life style and not in a good way.<br>  <br>  Congress controls the purse strings of the Nation , so Congress some what Control the Economy.<br>  <br>  News flash the Economy started to go to crap after Nancy Pelosi-Dem and Harry Reid-Dem took Control of Congress.<br>  <br>  Here is a little heads up on the $13.00 extra you get each week in your paycheck from the Stimulus Package , that money is not deductible you will be taxed on that $13.00 a week , ask a H&R Block type person that does taxes about it and be prepared .<br>  <br>  Have a nice day Comrade|`|pDuarKcjaa	You know I don't even know what goes on inside his head.

Disability is defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as any impairment or perceived impairment that significantly limits one or more major life activities (like work, education, or the ability to use public facilities).<br>  <br>  Physical impairments severe enough to cause such limitation are included--those tha tare minor are not. For example, simply being nearsighted is not a disability.<br>  <br>  Thesame is true of learning/cognitive or psychological disability. It's harder to quantify those, though. Usually the determination is made by qualified medical professionals based on the individuals level of function. Unfortunately, under another law (the Individuals with Disabilities Act) schools often get away with substituting the opinions of unqualified school employees for qualified medical judgement-resulting in many children being classed as "disabled" who are actually not.<br>  <br>  There is one more consideration. Under the ADA, if a person has a characteristic which is treated as an impairment, even though it isn't, and the result is to limit the person in a substantial way, they are protected under the ADA. For example, a "little person" (very short) is not impaired. The most you can say is they need a stepladder when others don't. However, our society defines them--and they are treated by employers--as if this were a serious dsability and are subjected to exclusion and job discrimination. Therefore, they are protected under the ADA.<br>  <br>  One more point. In our society, impairment (like loss of vision or hearing) is consedered "normal" for older people. As such, it is treated by society--and the law--as if it were not a disability. For example, as of the mandatory retirement age, a person on disability due to loss of vision is no longer classed as "disabled" but as "elderly." They get the same social security check--but are no longer eligible for any other assistance needed to allow them to function with the disability. It's no longer a "disability"  in the eyse s fo the law and they are relegated to a status where they are denied help unless they can pay for it themselves.|`|UkBq5kkIaa	Now, now.

This is not just the rantings of an "old coot" but the voice of experience and observation. Our country has been in a steady decline since the late 1950's. We raised a generation of children who knew no restrictions. Out of love, we provided to them unrestrained freedoms and pleasures which resulted in what is now called the "me" generation. Material things became the desire of their hearts....and credit cards and living beyond their means were born. Deficit spending for anything....as long as they considered it right for them...became the norm. Integrity disappeared and was replaced by greed and self fulfillment. Moral values declined as the "what's in it for me" attitude became the cry. The mindset of the country has changed drastically. It's unity of purpose has fallen by the wayside and the people are much poorer in spirit for it. Those of us who were the creators of these monsters now recognize our folly....but can't change the results. I am not at all surprised that someone was able to forecast these events.

Every time taxes go up that is less they want to risk, which means fewer jobs.  Even if they do take risks they may wish to take them outside the country.  <br>  <br>  Raising tax rates doesn't always translate into raising revenues.  Beyond a certain point revenue will decline, because people will avoid doing things for which they are taxed.  <br>  <br>  These are points that will go over most people's heads, which is why the voters in this country will allow our politicians to create another depression.  <br>  <br>  We're damned to live the mistakes of fools.|`|AA10079277	I am for equal taxes.

1NPKAKk7aa	I really don't give a crap what color his skin is.  What scares me about him is the decisions he is making.<br>  <br>  I disagree with everything he has done so far.<br>  <br>  1. He is closing guantanamo bay.<br>  Guantanamo bay represents the successes of the Iraq war.  many soldiers have died just to put those prisoners away.  And when the prison closes all of the cases will be "reviewed" by our courts.  And i bet you a ton of them go free, cause our judicial system is stupid.  They let people like OJ simpson go free.<br>  <br>  2. He is raising capital gains tax and raising tax for business owners.<br>  this will only cause more jobs to go over seas, buisness owners will compensate for this tax increase by laying people off.  It's a stupid idea and will make the american economy worse.<br>  <br>  3. He is putting restrictions on interogation.<br>  The one thing i like about Bush is that he didn't mess around when it came to national security.  The interogation teqniques that he allowed unearthed hundreds of terrorist plans, allowing us to stop them before they happened.  Obama is taking away the tools that we need to fight terrorism, A stupid, stupid thing to do.  I predict an attack will occur on US soil because of this.  And many americans will be killed.<br>  <br>  4. His stimulus bill.<br>  This is rediculous.  the amount of money he is about to spend is absurd.  What is happening is he is building a huge government.  More and more people will be employed by the government instead of the private sector.  The american way, capitalism, will be lost.  Other countries do this as well.  Russia, China, and look where it got them.  Soon there will be militay roaming the streets enforcing your curfew.  And life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will be a thing of the past.<br>  <br>  So for those of you still hung up on racism... go to hell.  The guy is a idealist.

People make poor choices -- the consequences are expensive -- and often, via taxes, we all foot the bill.<br>  <br>  There are some -- I guess they're Ayn Rand devotees or libertarians -- who advocate a very limited role for government.  As I understand it, the idea is that government mostly defends the nation and enforces the law.  Aside from that, each individual is responsible for taking care of himself.<br>  <br>  Although I don't advocate that philosophy, I recognize that it has some appeal, if only for its simplicity and internal consistency.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I'd be very worried about a system in which government tries to distinguish between "good" and "bad" behavior (as opposed to legal vs illegal).

We can hope that will happen. But you ask about the trillion dollar debt when in fact this trillion is no better or worse than the previous 10 trillion. So how do we recover any of it? And I think more importantly we should recognize that some debt is required. I used to be a zero deficit, zero debt hawk, but then I began reading a website that talked about the opportunity cost of debt. An example is that President Clinton saved money and actually ran a surplus in the 90s but this partially resulted in a decreased level of intelligence collection and a decreased level of combat readiness of our military. <br>  <br>  I agree with the point I found on this website which I list below. Wasted money is wasted. It doesn't matter if it is deficit spending or you are running a surplus. Likewise if you don't spend money that you should for the good of the nation (national defense) then you are derelict regardless of it causing a deficit or you run a surplus. <br>  <br>  What do you think?

But, Kennedy had nothing to do Vietnam. Kennedy was killed in 63'. The U.S. did not enter Vietnam until 64'. The actual act was signed in by President Johnson.<br>  <br>  July 31, 1964 - In the Gulf of Tonkin, as part of Operation Plan 34A, South Vietnamese commandos in unmarked speed boats raid two North Vietnamese military bases located on islands just off the coast. In the vicinity is the destroyer U.S.S. Maddox.<br>  <br>  August 4, 1964 - Although immediate doubts arise concerning the validity of the second attack, the Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly recommend a retaliatory bombing raid against North Vietnam.<br>  <br>  Press reports in America greatly embellish the second attack with spectacular eyewitness accounts although no journalists had been on board the destroyers.<br>  <br>  At the White House, President Johnson decides to retaliate. Thus, the first bombing of North Vietnam by the United States occurs as oil facilities and naval targets are attacked without warning by 64 U.S. Navy fighter bombers. "Our response for the present will be limited and fitting," President Johnson tells Americans during a midnight TV appearance, an hour after the attack began. "We Americans know, although others appear to forget, the risk of spreading conflict. We still seek no wider war." <br>  <br>  Until this time we where there as advisers only.

In the future, main stream, side stream, fringe stream and ex stream will all unanimously rate him too unfavorably to even call him anything so trivial as 'worst' president. His photo will be in a line up with Hitler, Stalin, Napoleon and Custer, and it will always only get worse with the passage of time... What do you care anyway? Why can't you just accept fact and reality without rooting for someone along the way?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't normally do this but just because I like your photo and you seem like a nice guy, I'll respond to your four pronged frontal assault (please take my advice seriously because I sincerely want you to conduct some independent study on this) - (and remember... I SAID I BLAME KENNEDY!):<br>  <br>  (1) The CIA, and whoever else you wish to add to the list, reported WMD because Bush instructed them to fabricate evidence and report WMD. (I'm not sure where to tell you look for info on this, but geez! Come one! It's got to be all over the place. (Somebody else please help me with some reference.)<br>  <br>  (2) CNN?!?!? Try the Geneva Convention. (I hear they're some kind of experts on the subject.)<br>  <br>  (3) You Tube?!?!? Tarzan, the president is responsible for FEMA. When FEMA fails, the president's administration fails. When the president's administration fails, the president fails. (Some famous guy once kept a plaque on the desk in the oval office that read, "The buck stops here.") In addition, "it was difficult and scary" is not an acceptable excuse. The difficult and the scary are always the first responsibility of government. That's why we have a government. Sensible preparation would have prevented a lack of preparation.<br>  <br>  (4) The most equitable moments of prosperity in this country (which are few and far between) occurred during brief moments of meaningful and substantive regulation such as taxes on imports to protect wages from incursion by foreign slave labor markets. On this subject you are in fact partially correct; Bush is not to blame. This is a program of deregulation and artificial transfer of wealth twenty-eight years in the making and as far as presidents go, the principle offenders are Reagan, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, (remember how I blamed Kennedy for Viet Nam... Yeah, that's right! I also blame the backstabbing duplicitous, sell-out political hack, Clinton, whom history will also not judge particularly favorably) Clinton, Bush II & Bush II, so in fact Bush is only two/sevenths to blame on this one. (On this one, I cite economics and economic history... Start with Wikipedia; just plug in capitalism then browse around through multiple related links; get creative; try looking up the great depression and maybe some generic stuff like 'regulation', 'deregulation', 'tariff', 'excise', 'supply side', 'scarcity of means', etc.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. I'll be seeing you around the Yahoo!sphere.

He was an actor prior to his position as president which led to his popularity.<br>  I am completely biased because Reagan was my all-time favorite president so I personally would choose Reagan, however... the answer would most definitely stem from which party is more dominant in the country at the time.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA)<br>  <br>  MERITS<br>  <br>  Judgment of 27 June 1986<br>  <br>  For its judgment on the merits in the case concerning military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua brought by Nicaragua against the United States of America, the Court was composed as follows:....<br>  The Court turns to the claims of Nicaragua based on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1956, and the claim that the United States has deprived the Treaty of its object and purpose and emptied it of real content. The Court cannot however entertain these claims unless the conduct complained of is not "measures . . . necessary to protect the essential security interests" of the United States, since Article XXI of the Treaty provides that the Treaty shall not preclude the application of such measures. With regard to the question what activities of the United States might have been such as to deprive the Treaty of its object and purpose, the Court makes a distinction. It is unable to regard all the acts complained of in that light, but considers that there are certain activities which undermine the whole spirit of the agreement. These are the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the direct attacks on ports, oil installations, etc., and the general trade embargo.<br>  The Court also upholds the contention that the mining of the ports is in manifest contradiction with the freedom of navigation and commerce guaranteed by Article XIX of the Treaty. It also concludes that the trade embargo proclaimed on 1 May 1985 is contrary to that article.<br>  <br>  The Court therefore finds that the United States is prima facie in breach of an obligation not to deprive the 1956 Treaty of its object and purpose (pacta sunt servanda), and has committed acts in contradiction with the terms of the Treaty. The Court has however to consider whether the exception in Article XXI concerning "measures . . . necessary to protect the essential security interests" of a Party may be invoked to justify the acts complained of. After examining the available material, particularly the Executive Order of President Reagan of 1 May 1985, the Court finds that the mining of Nicaraguan ports, and the direct attacks on ports and oil installations, and the general trade embargo of 1 May 1985, cannot be justified as necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bush Jr. Never in a 1,000 years.|`|Qdw3uPFYaa	regan, he was good wholsome america, no scandals, Bill was out bangin interns, Bush Jr was a half retard and just so stupid...|`|EcNf50rcaa	Clinton.<br>  <br>  The other two sucked.|`|SPsYrJJEaa	Reagan would have won a third, fourth and fifth if his health and the constitution would have allowed it.!!|`|2i5GWxUdaa	Reagan, he is the best president we have had in the last couple decades.|`|NnMzREtNaa	Reagan, he almost had a complete sweep of the country in '84|`|KfxTNNP5aa	Defenitely Reagan and probably Clinton but not Bush.

He simply "delayed" when we're all going to get reamed by relentless high taxes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's why history says Obama is completely out of his mind, insane:<br>  <br>  Under Coolidge, marginal tax rates were cut from the top rate of 73% to 24%. The economy rewarded this policy by expanding 59% from 1921 to 1929. Revenues received by the federal treasury increased from $719 million in 1921 to more than $1.1 billion 1929. That's a 61% increase (there was zero inflation in this period). Growth averaged more than six percent annually. We are currently growing at 2.5%.<br>  <br>  Under Kennedy, marginal tax rates were cut from a top rate of 91% to 70%. In real dollar terms, the economy grew by 42%, an average of 5 percent a year from 1961 to 1965. Tax revenue to the U.S. Treasury increased by 62%. Adjusted for inflation, they rose by one-third.<br>  <br>  Under Reagan, marginal tax rates were cut from a top of 70% to 28%. Revenues (from all taxes) to the U.S. Treasury nearly doubled. According to the Budget of the U.S. Government, FY 1997, Office of Management and Budget. Revenues increased from roughly $500 billion in 1980 to $1.1 trillion in 1990. <br>  <br>  Link to source: <a href="http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=676" rel="nofollow">http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=...</a><br>  <br>  Also infuriating, since 1992, a pattern has emerged between Democrat control of the Congress and the White House, and the Dow-Jones Industrial Average.

If you are the sort of person who enjoys a debate and is good at arguing your point of view persuasively, that is also a big plus.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you are a very creative person you will probably find law boring - the very best lawyers are often highly creative in that they are good at thinking laterally and finding unconventional solutions to problems, but there is a lot of legwork to do before you get to that stage.|`|OLvNK5FOaa	its not like in the movies <br>  there is a lot of paper work<br>  and memorizing <br>  you have to memorize everything ur going to say in court <br>  and rehearse what u r going to say to ur witness when you cross examine them<br>  so i mean if you like it and ur interested in that, then yeh you should go for it, its ur life and ur decision<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  :-)|`|KcAehrrKaa	Sure|`|iIbWXXYOaa	do what you want to do. its your life|`|cHaLRyrmaa	It's probably going to be really hard perfecting everything, making sure not to miss loopholes and memorizing and preparing everything all the time.

AA11248330	It's amazing how right-wing trolls and their hosts love to pontificate, isn't it? Unfortunately for them, they only prove my points. One of them offers: "...MSNBC, CNN are losing their audience in greater numbers, while Fox, Hannity or Rush Limbaugh numbers are increasing. ..." Unfortunately, the argument is not only lacking in facts, but illustrates why the Fairness Doctrine is important. For instance, Fox "News" ranted on, as did Rush and Ken doll Sean, about WMDs in Iraq, as well as every other lie put forth by the Bush administration, reaching millions of listeners and viewers, while also slandering the U.N. weapons inspectors, who just happened to be right. If you add political Christian broadcasting to this toxic mix, you get a monopoly that is dangerous. Progressives didn't get on Armed Forces radio until late in 2005, but even then Ed Schultz was threatened with cancellation before he even debuted, because he criticized someone in the Bush administration. This isn't championing free speech. It is patently unfair practice. It also illustrates the tilted news our military is getting. That, too, is dangerous. <br>  <br>  Right-wing radio offers propaganda, not facts, with the intent to play on the listeners emotions, without offering content that is based in reality. The ratings prove that FNC, Fox "News" channel is losing out in the ratings. In addition, the ignorance of conservatives about media and radio is further shown when they say the Fairness Doctrine is about "...demanding that the government implement further control or regulation over an entire industry, it might be simpler to look in the mirror, at the rating points & ad revenues & realize that the market for the “progressive” or liberal slant isn’t as popular or pervasive as you assume it to be. ... Again, they miss the point. Ed Schultz and Stephanie Miller, as well as the leader in progressive talk, Randi Rhodes, are making it in the commercial market. They are not only popular, but growing. The issue is to allow more progressive hosts on local am/fm radio to see if we can also make it. Unless you've been in the battle for radio you don't know what it's like, with conservative corporations not even giving progressives a chance to get on air, or cancelling good hosts before they have the time to prove themselves. You have to give progressive hosts a chance to build an audience, which takes time. But conservatives do not want fairness, which can be seen through their trade policy, as well as their anti-union rhetoric, which has decimated the middle class, by selling out workers for outsourcing all in the name of profit. They want a one-way talking machine on radio, paid by and benefiting only their political partners in business, as well. <br>  Right-wing is on the air and getting advertisers because they're the only game in town, except for a few progressive hosts like Schultz, Miller and Rhodes. The Fairness Doctrine will not keep a bad show on, but it will allow entry to good hosts who are now being shut out by conservative conglomerates<br>  The short version of the Fairness Doctrine is that in 1987 Reagan had it scuttled. Shortly after that Rush Limbaugh began his journey and right-wing radio was created and gradually took over the airwaves, with the help of their corporate friends. The Fairness Doctrine could really make a difference. Why do you think conservatives are screaming like crazy?|`|shtP63traa	No, I'm not concerned.

If your crime was a violent one, then you may have restrictions from being in a home with weapons.<br>  <br>  Any time you are around weapons, you risk the police charging you with being in possession. I know, it's draconian and unconstitutional, but the powers that be just don't care.<br>  <br>  Talk to your PO about your questions. He or she should have a lot better information and would definitely know about any such restrictions placed upon your household.<br>  <br>  It is just plain foolishness for any home in America to be without a firearm.

Once your picked up then you'll be sent to a college full time to finish your degree. Upon graduation you'll be commissioned a 2nd LT.  B) If you wish to actually complete your degree on active duty then you may do so with a lot of sacrifice and some support from your chain of command.  If you complete your degree then you may apply for a Direct Commission to the Officer Corps.  C) Do your active duty time and use the money for college then upon completion of your degree you may apply for a direct commission prior to coming into the Army...this time as a 2nd LT.  <br>  <br>  To Alexander: It can be done and I've yet to work for a chain of command that doesn't support it's Soldiers going to college.

Enough people have already died on all sides already, fruitlessly because Northern Ireland never did get the unity and independance that some of them wanted and thousands died needlessly , mainly because their cause is so weak with fluctuating support, that dwindled out over the years and of course because of the loyalist support as well.. <br>  <br>  Nothing matters enough to justify all that has happened over the years and certainly  when they live as well as they do and that includes Catholics who love to  portray themselves has poverty stricken and repressed, I was very surprised when I actually got there to find the reality was far from that. Those that struggle is reflective of how anyone struggles in any country and not because they  are repressed under the iron fist dictatorship of the UK,its ridiculous, they live a typical westernised life with all the freedoms and benefits of any other person that lives in the Western world, I know because I was there, its hard to cry out repression when you live such a cushy life compared to those that really do live under a dictatorship. <br>  <br>  Northen Ireland governs itself and the British military were only ever there to support the police and since 2007 they have been keeping a low profile. The IRA have just killed two 20 year old British soldiers  and two or one pizza delivery men. Lovely. When I was in Northern Ireland in 2000 no fast food places would deliver to military establishments for just this reason. Looks like they will probably go back to that. Soldiers like pizza and like to spend their money on that sort of thing and this acheive nothing except hurting business and hurting a few families that have lost loved ones. Nothing will change, what a waste of life.<br>  <br>  Delivering pizza to soldiers  is clearly back to be punishable by death and Northern Ireland still won't have freedom because huge numbers of people that live there actually don't want it.<br>  <br>  My whole family on my Dad's side are from Northern Ireland and they are loyalists, speaking to them , really gives an insight into how strongly they feel they are British ,and  I also served with The Royal Irish Regiment on attachment , so I have had an upclose veiw of how passionate these people are about maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the UK,  they are at least as passionate as those who don't want it and are willing to fight for it. This cause is a lost one until all people in Northern Ireland actually want freedom and because they don't  its certainly not going to happen without more bloodshed, thats for sure. Is that what you want?<br>  <br>  As for Scotland, they have always made anti-English noises but they are not willing to fight for it and not willing to lose all the advantages that come with being part of the UK either, they would have done it already by now if they were going to do it.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Go for it that's what democracy is all about, <br>  The freedom of the individual to choose by free election who he wants to govern through the ballot box. <br>  It's only the Ignorant an the Stupid, who choose to go another way because they cannot put up a reasonable argument to support there belief so they turn to murder an bullying to get there way.<br>  They Are All Cowards who have No Morals or Guts to come out in the open but choose to hide behind someone else rather than put them selves at risk. <br>  They would rather drag a country back to years of bloodshed all because they are Stupid Ignorant Fools who are Selfish to the Extreme.|`|if5bmGbPaa	Ireland no, it's to handy for the British Elite to use as 'Terrorists' with our MI5, if they want to take away more of our rights.

HVMX90Ijaa	yes I have...and like a couple of the answers before me have stated:<br>  <br>  You haven't sworn in a second time. Meaning you have no "real" obligation.

So don't buy it. <br>  <br>  As for HOW to get out of the DEP it's really as easy as just not showing up on your shipping date. Of course tell your recruiter, but after that, when you don't show up on your shipping date to MEPS they will just assume you have changed your mind. <br>  <br>  I'm not exactlly sure of your reasoning for wanting out, so I'm not going to judge you like some other people have. The reason I wanted out was because I was lied to about certain MOS's and ended up with a job I had absolutelly no intrests in being in. And instead of going through the difficulties of changing the mos I simply said forget this shyt...if they were going to lie to me them it wasn't worth it anyways. So when my ship date came I didn't show. And I was free to join the army DEP...<br>  <br>  I now leave in a month with the exact MOS I wanted. If you have any other questions about the DEP feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|BQG15WsHaa	No, because I actually go by what I say I'm going to do. <br>  <br>  If you want out of the DEP all you have to do if say, "Bye, I'm leaving the DEP". Your recruiter will be pissed but technically you haven't sworn in the second time. He'll probably try to threaten you, but he really can't do ****. You're not the Navy's *** until you ship out.<br>  <br>  Have fun finding an employer. Not sure they want someone who isn't true to their word though.|`|7idyT7Obaa	if you want out just tell your recruiter. keep in mind that he will lie to you and tell you that: youll be punished by UCMJ or get a dishonerable discharge or the MPs will come after you or you'll go to jail or the navy will sue you or whatever, but NONE of that is true.<br>  1: you dont fall under UCMJ until the day that you leave for basic<br>  2: you are not in the military yet so you cant get a dishonerable discharge<br>  3: again, you're not in the military so the MPs wont come after you. no civilian laws hold you either so you wont go to jail<br>  4: the navy cant sue you.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	How many times are you going to ask this question?  <br>  <br>  Hasn't everyone explained to you by now that you are basically vaginal discharge?<br>  <br>  Just tell your recruiter you aren't going to ship so he can move on to someone else.  <br>  <br>  We (the military) don't need you.  Get lost.
7bc450c6091ac93a4d64108b856a5e7daa	You cant!! You're gonna be shipped out if you like it or not!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  jk. If you're scared, its okay. Just go with it. <br>  <br>  You can go and tell the recruiter you just dont want to join. Simple.
1fc47d4ec6251308e03b6b28361f4fb9aa	to the Greatstank...follow your own advice...<br>  <br>  First off the question is basically asking, should Mexico have let Texas be its own nation instead of fighting to keep it in their control. Nothing to do with the US, but how quickly the defenses of the nervous patriots come out when threatened...(panacea)<br>  <br>  Also it is not saying it annexed itself, it is merely saying that it would have been CAPABLE of doing so, which it was, just because you need a buyer to sell your car, does not mean you didn't sell it. They put themselves on the market for the US, and they eventually bought it...<br>  <br>  now let's talk about the actual question shall we...which many of you are refusing to do because obviously there is too much bias in your voice and not enough actual knowledge on the subject...<br>  <br>  Texas has a long history, and its hard to generalize or summarize it in a few sentences, but I'll try...<br>  <br>  Texas' first settlers were a mix of anglo-american people from US, slaves and of course mexican. At first Mexico encouraged immigration from the US, but after multiple offers from the US to buy Texas, they grew suspicious (and rightfully so) that they were trying to overtake the territory. So, as a result, they outlawed immigration into Texas from the US, (hmm doesn't that sound familiar, just backwards though). But, much like today, people still did it. And as I mentioned, texans owned slaves. Mexico was an abolitionist nation, and they gave texas 1 year to get rid of their slaves. Which most didn't and/or turned them into indentured servants. In actuality Mexico tried to work with texas, and repealed the immigration law, allowing settlers from the US to come back in. there's a lot of info here i wont go into...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Texas" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Tex...</a> <br>  <br>  now that said. Texas was essentially a Mexican territory that was foolishly allowed to be settled by Americans. They did not adhere to Mexican laws, traditions and customs, nor were they even respectful towards them. Also, many other Mexican states such as Zacatecas were threatening to rebel. So NO, I think the Mexican government did the right thing. They did not allow a diva state to do whatever they wanted without a fight. If they had, other states would have demanded same treatment. Put it into today's context, if Texas asks to be separated tmmrw, says it will be its own nation, but you have suspicions they are trying to join Mexico, do you think the US will just let that happen? <br>  <br>  And in response to the whole paying thing. The war was fought, and could have gone on. The United States paid that in order to give Mexico incentive to stop the war. and it was less than half than they had originally offered for the land, So Mexico decided to cut their losses, but in no way was US doing them a favor, you tool (panacea). <br>  <br>  I'll not go into the fact that the only reason Texas won against Mexico is because of a completely dishonorable attack on sleeping Mexican forces and threatening the general to sign a treaty or die. Mexico did not even recognize Texas as independent until they became part of US. but that's a whole other story....|`|bQJzUgiXaa	No.  Texas did not annex itself to the US.  Texas separated from Mexico.  Mexico killed everyone at the Alamo and got the land back.  Then the US attacked Mexico over a Texas border dispute.|`|KT0oKTZdaa	plus a nation can not annex its self into another nation, they can ask to be excepted into the nation, but cant make them self part of it.|`|AA11707728	Yeah umm, the US did not attack mexico as stated by someone else.  Mexico attacked the US, using the TX dispute (which originally did not have anything to do with the US) as an excuse.  They got their *** handed to them as a hat.  The US decided to take these border lands as a hedge against future mexican aggression.  However, what the mexicans fail to tell people about that is that the US (despite not having to because those lands were seized during a war THEY started) paid mexico for that land.<br>  <br>  All those jerks from mexico saying those US lands actually belong to them, leave out the fact that we paid them for it.|`|AA11818174	No, because the Texans were completely disrespecting Mexican rule and not even trying to abide by the lawful laws.

AA10057599	i bet you took that on military.com didnt you?  you just wasted your time brother.  go to asvab.us and D/L the practice test and let me know what you get on there.|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	43 means "uh oh."|`|iDCWOvVBaa	You receive a score for each of the eight subtests, as well as a score for three "composite areas" as described below.<br>  <br>  Verbal Ability Composite = Word Knowledge Score + Paragraph Comprehension Score <br>  Math Ability Composite = Arithmetic Reasoning Score + Mathematics Knowledge Score <br>  Academic Ability Composite = Verbal Ability Composite + Math Ability Composite <br>  <br>  Your Raw Score is calculated with the following formula:<br>  (Word Knowledge Score x 2) + (Paragraph Comprehension Score x 2) + (Arithmetic Reasoning Score) + (Mathematics Knowledge Score) = Raw Score <br>  <br>  <br>  So for example, if you score 20 on Word Knowledge, 10 on Paragraph Comprehension, 20 on Arithmetic Reasoning, and 20 Mathematics Knowledge, your raw score would be 100.<br>  <br>  The raw score you obtained is also calculated as a Percentile Score. For example, if you scored in the 60th percentile then 40% of the candidates that were tested scored higher than you and 59% had scores that were lower than yours. This score is very important to a recruiter.<br>  <br>  The last calculation derived from your scores is the Military Careers Score. This score is a combination of Academic Ability Composite score and the Mechanical Comprehension and Electronics Information scores. The score range is 140 to 240 with 200 being about average. A book titled Military Careers will accompany your test results. It is designed to describe most of the careers available in the military as well as the job requirements for each career. In addition you can reference a graph that shows your chance of acceptance based on the Military Careers Score. <br>  <br>  The scores you obtained in the General Science and Auto and Shop Information subtests are not used to calculate any of the above mentioned scores. These scores are used by recruiters to identify other career areas in which you might be successful. <br>  <br>  <br>  Your first priority should be to get as high a percentile score as you possibly can. <br>  <br>  The term "MOS" (Military Occupational Specialty) is used to identify careers in the Army. When reviewing a potential recruit, the Army will divide your ASVAB subtest score into groups that are called line scores. The ASVAB subtests are:<br>  General Science (GS);<br>  Arithmetic Reasoning (AR);<br>  Word Knowledge (WK);<br>  Paragraph Comprehension (PC);<br>  Numerical Operations (NO);<br>  Coding Speed (CS);<br>  Auto and Shop Information (AS);<br>  Mathematics Knowledge (MK);<br>  Mechanical Comprehension (MC);<br>  Electronics Information (EI);<br>  and Sum of Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension (VE).<br>  <br>  Note that as Numerical Operations (NO) and Coding Speed (CS) subtests are phased out, some line scores may be changed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Army Line Scores:<br>  <br>  CL - Clerical: VE+AR+MK <br>  <br>  CO - Combat: VE+CS+AS+MC (CS has been removed from the ASVAB and is now replaced with a "dummy" score.)<br>  <br>  EL - Electronics: GS+AR+MK+MC <br>  <br>  FA - Field Artillery: AR+CS+MK+MC (CS has been removed from the ASVAB and is now replaced with a "dummy" score.)<br>  <br>  GM - General Maintenance: GS+AS+MK+EI <br>  <br>  GT - General Technical: VE+AR <br>  <br>  MM - Mechanical Maintenance: NO+AS+MC+EI (NO has been removed from the ASVAB and is now replaced with a "dummy" score.)<br>  <br>  OF - Operators and Food: VE+NO+AS+MC (CS has been removed from the ASVAB and is now replaced with a "dummy" score.)<br>  <br>  SC - Surveillance and Communications: VE+AR+AS+MC <br>  <br>  ST - Skilled Technical: GS+VE+MK+MC|`|qGh1HhPwaa	<a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/od/joiningthemilitary/l/blafqtscore.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usmilitary.about.com/od/joiningth...</a>

htSZsds7aa	Divorce is a sad situation for all, but its not just about banning it, its about 2 people who need to compromise on things, seek counciling when needed and stop thinking about themselves. We are a society that is all about me and only me. We must learn to be civil to each other, not break trust with one and other and believe in commitment. Pre marriage counciling is a good start and will teach us that life isnt always a bowl of cherries.|`|MOALBorJaa	Personally I think marriage out to be prohibited by law altogether. If you are pro-family then you should be against marriage as is amply demonstrated by a 1 out of 2 divorce rate. The # 1 cause of divorce in this or any other country is marriage. Think about it. No marriages no divorces.|`|d767bd8e7c5e71c919663faf0980a9d7aa	First off, Brittany and her one husband got an annulment. Quite a bit different than and outright divorce.<br>  <br>  - Annulment is a legal procedure for declaring a marriage null and void. Unlike divorce, it is retroactive: an annulled marriage is considered never to have existed. -<br>  <br>  Secondly what you are proposing is basically a government mandate limiting a citizens free will. There are several violations of the constitution to what you have suggested, really to many for me to reasonably type out. While it may be unfortunate and damaging; laws can not be used in this manner. People make mistakes, hate it, or love it, people have the right to do what they want with their lives, even if the consequences are damaging.

This is one of the rare situations where you might actually have a case. An exception to "employment at will" is if the discharge violates public policy of the state.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Most companies are "at will" so they can determine "it's not a fit" for just about anything.

I'm finding that most companies like to hear you say you're a go getter but when you get there and actually try and fix problems...........you're stepping on someone's toes and are labeled a trouble maker. Learn to go with the flow next time.  I say this because I'm experiencing it right now.  Tried to fix all kinds of problems but then that meant I was exposing someone's poor work and also making someone else have to work to get things done. Now, I keep my mouth shut and head down until I find a company that NEEDS and WANTS problem areas fixed.

KKaggQr7aa	Why its "easy peasy" to live & work in UK on French, German, Italian, Czech, Polish, Finnish passport... (list grows) ???<br>  <br>  TN is Trade Nafta .. an agreement between USA, Canada & Mexico. TN20 is what Canadians get (also known is TN1) TN2 is what mexicans get (but its a visa not visa free entry). <br>  <br>  This is all due to mutual agreements between Nations. Australia is in no such agreement with USA/UK or most of other countries, so since being non-EU Australians cannot live & work in UK, they need to follow the rules like any other non-EU nation.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	Why should Australians be able to live and work in the UK on an Australian passport? The two countries have nothing to do with each other and these days, have about as much connection as the UK and the US. Many Australians on Australian passports qualify to live and work in the UK by virtue of their British grandparents but if they don't have that, there is no reason whatsoever for them to have residence privileges. After all, Australia offers nothing of the kind to UK passport holders - they must qualify to live and work there in exactly the same way as people from any other country and having an Australian grandparent would make no difference. To be fair, the Poms should probably be removing the ancestry visa provisions to make it even harder for Aussies to live there.<br>  <br>  The Canada/USA situation is completely different. They are close neighbours with long standing ties and treaties and similar economies and outlooks and movement between the two countries has historically (and logically) always been easy. AFAIK know though, Canadians are not allowed to freely live and work in the US and must have a green card to do so unless they qualify for a work permit.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Who told you that? Canadians can not work in the USA without a green card which is the same as for all other foreigners.

(by the way Regan did not need either and did not say um and he was in his 70's he did say welllll a lot though). After the prepared speech President Obama answers question on the fly and does not use a TelePrompter or the big screen and that's when the ums begin. Watching him this evening I think he has reduces his ums. But that has do more with the soft ball questions that were given to him in tonight's questioning. I watched CNN and their on line poles. What was interesting that when they compared their scientific poles with their own viewer poles support for the president in the scientific poles was lower than the CNN pole. CNN did not give as much time on the scientific poles as they did on their own.

nhWTN3uhaa	There are two types of actors and two types of politicians, those who had real jobs and a real education/life experience prior to becoming an actor or politician and those who did not.  If you go straight from college in to politics and never held a real job, ran a company, met a payroll, bought a house, experienced the lousy public school, etc. you don't understand what works and what doesn't work.  Many actors have no real skills beyond acting, if it weren't for making it big in Hollywood the would be homeless.  That can be said for politicians as well except they would all be lawyers instead of homeless.  I'm not sure which is worse being homeless or a lawyer, either way we have too many of both.  <br>  <br>  These zero life experience (naive) actors get their life experience from the roles they play.  How many times have you seen and actor or actress play a part and then claim they are an expert in that area?  It happens all the time.  Penn is now an expert on Homosexuallty right!  <br>  <br>  The solution to the stupidity of these actors and directors is to make higher quality movies where the art is actually a realistic depiction of life instead of a one sided hatchet job by the left.   For an extreme example of this look at any movie Michael Moore makes.  If your had no life experience of your own and you watched one of his movies you would think Detroit is in trouble because the unions were too weak, Cuba has the best healthcare system in the world, Bush bombed the WTC, and guns in the hands of criminals is not a problem but in the hands of law abiding citizens is scary as hell. If Hollywood were to fix the problem they would need to produce more complicated and sophisticated movies that unfortunately would go over the heads of most audiences and clearly the producers.  So what is the solution?<br>  <br>  Self education.  The public needs to educate themselves so they can spot phony politicians and stupid actors and not give either of them the time of day.  If we don't do it, then most of our actors will be like Sean Penn and most of our politicians will be like Obama who if we aren't careful will turn into Chavez the dictator not Chavez the grape picker.  Unfortunately Obama has the skills to be either Chavez, lets send him home to unionize workers and get him out of the White House|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	Penn is either stupid or a traitor.

Just like a lot of other legitimate government aid programs that certain segments of society pretend to qualify for (like the welfare queens of a decade or two ago) so they can live off the rest of our tax money.  To those people it is free because if they don't work, or work very little, they do not pay nearly enough to cover their own expenses and the rest of us wind up footing the bill.  I am not saying that there aren't people who legitimately qualify for government aid, or that all of the freeloaders are of the same ethnic group.  I have known both people who really needed the help and people (both black and white) who freeloaded shamelessly because they were too lazy to work for themselves (and sometimes even bragged about it).  These are the people that the advocates conveniently do not acknowledge the existence of when they say that everyone would pay a "reasonable" amount.<br>  <br>  Just like the user "wartz" said, it is tax supported like public schools.  This actually makes it more expensive for the people who make more money than for those who make less.  Since everyone is supposed to get the same level of care, this builds in a bit of unfairness from the beginning.  If you make more, you are actually penalized by this system.  And because it is organized by the government, there is just about zero accountability.|`|o0JEkGCjaa	No idea.<br>  We have this plan in MA.

It is very interesting to watch how all this develops in the upcoming months;-)|`|AA10645437	Just curious... since you label it "radical Zionism" does that imply that there is a "moderate strain of Zionism" that you approve of?<br>  <br>  And in your heading you say "eliminate Israel zionist". What exactly does that mean? Since by nature Israel is a Zionist state, then it would seem to imply that you are advocating the destruction of Israel. So how can you say with a straight face that "Israels people are not the problem" when they are the ones most directly affected by your so-called solution?<br>  <br>  And also wondering, do you bother to factor "radical Islamism" into your "analysis"?<br>  Because, after all, it does exist and it does present a problem for people who advocate peace.<br>  <br>  For the record, I think no one is capable of bringing peace, let alone Hillary Clinton. That is due to the current reality on the ground which is unlikely to change, and if it does it will be for the worse. And if there is a chance for it to change for the better, then it certainly won't happen for at least a generation. At the very least, your own radicalism is certainly not helping.|`|D5A9JUDMaa	Did you hear her give "Obama's answer" the other day?<br>  <br>  Go back to the debate between Oshama and McCain after the Russians invaded Georgia....<br>  <br>  McCain gave a FULL accounting of the leaders involved, the factions, the pipeline running through the region, etc....

I am still waiting (and suspect you can never answer) for your link to the story of the fifty one foot ladder with the government experiment to build one on the border.<br>  But you have done yourself proud with this story, I like that you use site like American Patrol, Illegal Aliens and Fair US as back up support.

Would not the fact that an immigrant crossed illegally be enough of a common violation or do non supporters just like to hear themselves speak?<br>  <br>  It seems to me that many of my own posts are ignored due to honesty.

If you cannot even admit that your party is wrong then how can you fix it. The top ten states who received the most pork were Red States -Bobby Jindal's home State and Sarah Palin's were two most noteworthy. They have been very vocal in being against them but have lined up at the trough to get these hand outs. It is a shame that the answers cant come up with anything so they use the "NOBAMA" we hate him Child like rants when in fact their party has added 40% to the bill in Congress...it makes them look stupider and it makes the party look like hypocrites. Quite laughable and this will not be forgotten in 2010 elections.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	I don't care who is putting the pork into the bills.

Since there is a 100% chance that EVERY Democrat district will get pork, they don't think it's helpful to their own districts to be selected for exclusion.<br>  Democrats are NOT honest and telling people they think the earmarks are valid, they're DENYING they exist at all. THIS is hypocrisy.|`|XuLVfj1caa	Yes, it's hypocrisy.  But even worse, is that these guys go on TV and complain about earmarks and say they're going to vote against the bill, never revealing that they also have earmarks in the bill.  Then when the bill is passed and they didn't vote for it, they go home and put out press releases that they fought for this money for their constituents.  It's amazing.  <br>  <br>  People need to just be honest.|`|AA11031560	Everything the package is intended to pay for is "Pork" in someones mind, especially if it is not to be spent on what they want and where they want it spent.

I think McCain is a positive voice from the other side.  Of course he will never completely agree with the President, but he is a smart guy and is honorable and well meaning.  He has some good ideas and is someone the President can call on from the other side to get good alternative ideas.  This just can't be a democratic only solution.

Crooks and thieves reign supreme in the US these days, and the administration is determined to bury them under billions of taxpayer dollars no matter what.  AIG, the insurance mega-failure, is a case in point.  That thing will suck down hundreds of billions over the next couple of years, which the top execs rake in as hundreds of million in bonuses and throw lavish parties and take extended vacations in exotic places.  The Obama Administration seems bound and determined to throw as much money down the gaping maw of AIG as it can.<br>  <br>  Part of the mentality is this: if you have a debt problem, the sure way to fix it is to go deeper into debt.  Bankrupting yourself is one solution, I suppose.|`|MoGt1Z1qaa	Tell me one thing that he actually did to make it worse. If I can't prove it wrong, I will then agree with you.<br>  <br>  Until then, it's getting worse because there are enough people in Congress that they don't all have the same "agenda" and are trying to achieve different things. There are enough Republicans that Dems can't just force a bill through, and let's face it - Obama is absolutely powerless without the Congress agreeing with him.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	Here's a theory:<br>  President Obama and the Democrats have a 2 years window to initiate all the social programs and political patronage that they have been ACHING to do since 1994. So better to do it now while they still have plausible deniability that the Bush Administration has afforded them.<br>  After that, the Obama Administration has to begin to think about re-election, which means tacking to the middle again.

This cycle can be traced back at least 1,000 years in Western history. The tendency is for people to panic and start wars and try to lay the blame on somebody. The Bible mandates that all debt in society should be cancelled every 50 years. If people practiced the Jubilee year, these collapses would never happen.|`|VnjKoYhKaa	He's not doing it on purpose.  At the core, Obama believes that government will be more "fair" than market forces.  He believes that government will be more compassionate that capitalism.  Obama believes in French-style socialism where equality is emphasized over prosperity and where individual opportunity is channeled into collective opportunity.  He believes that cyclical downturns and popping bubbles are less preferable than constant government intervention.  He was raised by communists (literally) and has self-selected an activist socialist crowd as his friends.  He is not trying to make it worse but he can't see that his philosophy of economics and government -- which has been tried and failed for nearly a century on every continent except Antarctica-- have never produced prosperity of the kind we have enjoyed since WWII.

You just can't keep blaming everything on Bush unless your on of those "Obama right or wrong" types.  <br>  <br>  The truth is that business is very afraid of Obama's intentions.  Between higher tax rates on capital gains and income in 2011, threats to "cap and trade"  the energy sector and regulate, nationalize and price control banking and healthcare, nearly 40% of the economy will no longer rise and fall in stock value according the ideas and work ethic of the American entrepeneur and worker, but instead will prosper or struggle largely on the basis of legislation.  And so far, prospering seems out of the picture for the industries the government wants to control with the excepion of alternative energy.<br>  <br>  Investment capital is on the sidelines waiting to see how far the government will extend its reach into the private sector and as Obama rolls out program after program that threatens free markets and capitalism, capital is fleeing to the safety of Treasury bonds and to other markets around the world.<br>  <br>  This stuff is dangerous and filled with unintended consquences.|`|MoGt1Z1qaa	He has not yet set any policies in place.

And you might be careful who you shop with as well so you don't get brought down by association.<br>  I'm going to spare you the lecture on shoplifting on the assumption that everyone else has/will be giving it to you.<br>  Any store has the implied right to refuse service. <br>  Some stores will ban repeat shoplifter offenders.<br>  I have known store to share information on such banned people- some stores where I live have a list of names/photos of fraudsters who are banned. This is particularly true of wal-mart.<br>  Even so you can probably still  go back to the store you were at again.<br>  when you do so be extra careful-drop your bag off with the clerk, make sure you get a receipt for any purchase. Be prepared to leave if asked. Politely.<br>  Its good that your parents supported you. Not all parents would have.<br>  I would advise you to avoid all possible misunderstandings in the future. Your parents may be less understanding of repeat occurrences, to say nothing of store security/police.<br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  I thought an edit is neccessary. The assumption of the answerers so far is that a shoplifting event occured.

It's a privately-owned site, so they get to set their own rules... then they enforce the rules ARBITRARILY. Sometimes Harry Hitler is the judge, other times it's Stephen Stalin... ya just never know which you'll get.<br>  <br>  Why are we looking for binLaden?Why wouldn't we? Here's my take on it: we, and much of the world, believe that binLaden was the "mastermind" behind 9/11 and the inspiration, if not the trigger-man, for the London bombings, madrid, and the embassy bombings in Africa in the 90's.. If we didn't go after him, it would signal that we are weak. There is a time to turn the other cheek, and there's a time to hunt down a weasel like binLaden to the ends of the earth UNTIL WE FIND HIM. Anything less is giving up.  <br>  <br>  There is a humongous reward for binLaden, $25 MILLION, I believe.. and nobody has given him up yet. Given that there probably are degrees of militancy (both religious and military) among the Afghan tribes, the Paki tribes and the Taliban, it makes sense to reach out to the "moderate" factions. That allows us better access, more open doors and the chance to make more headway than we've made, ESPECIALLY since Bush and his Bouquet Of Buffoons absolutely BLEW IT when they took troops out of, and the emphasis off of, Afghanistan to indulge in that misadventure in Iraq.<br>  <br>  By refocusing on binLaden and Afghanistan, as tragic as such military operations are in terms of lives and money, I gotta go with "the search for binLaden." It also shows that no matter the cost, we WILL find the guy, and will seriously f*ck up anyone who helps him or hides him. A carrot and stick approach: "help us and get stuff... or hurt us and get stuffed."<br>  <br>  Shame on the Republicans for rah-rah-ing Bush's misadventure.

Some of these rules are about keeping the place civil and safe for minors, others strictly related to the concept like the question and answer format. Political or any other bias does not enter into it.<br>  <br>  On the merit I'm one of the few probably who totally agrees with you<br>  <br>  As for Obama's claim that Afghanistan and Pakistan constitute the “central front in the war on terror” and that American forces are fighting “the terrorists who hit us on 9/11,” he is engaging in the same kind of lying propaganda that the Bush administration used to promote the war in Iraq.<br>  The reality is that the US intervention in Afghanistan—like the one in Iraq—is aimed not at combating terrorism, but at securing US hegemony over crucial energy reserves and pipeline routes in both regions.<br>  US-led forces are engaged in a dirty colonial-style war in Afghanistan, confronting popular resistance from forces that have nothing to do with Al Qaeda. To suppress this resistance, they have resorted to an increasingly indiscriminate use of air power, killing growing numbers of civilians and, in turn, fueling popular hatred of the occupation.<br>  The Obama administration's Afghan troop "surge" and the ensuing ratcheting up of violence will have catastrophic consequences for the Afghani and Pakistani peoples. It adds a new, explosive dynamic to the decades-old geopolitical rivalry between India and Pakistan and will intensify the great power competition for control of oil-rich Central Asia, sowing the seeds for even larger and more destructive wars.<br>  The current US intervention in Afghanistan is the culmination of three decades of intrigue and subversion, which first saw the US arm Islamic guerrillas, in order to destabilize a pro-Soviet government in Kabul and draw the Soviet Union into a disastrous land war, and later, in the name of fighting "Islamist terrorism," occupy Afghanistan and install a corrupt and violent puppet government.<br>  The intensification of the war in Afghanistan will only further destabilize the entire region.<br>  The explosive geopolitical tensions that are being stoked by the US drive to extend its reach into Central Asia were starkly revealed in last August's eruption of the Russo-Georgian war.<br>  The development of a global depression will only intensify the great power struggle for markets, resources and geopolitical advantage.|`|ZnPWwsqUaa	We were attacked on our soil, of course we were going to retaliate.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	Unfortunately the US does not presently a have a work/visit visa program for young people with the UK (it does with Ireland but you have to be an Irish citizen).<br>  <br>  You should be able to get a student visa and attend university or community college here; that includes the ability to work part time while classes are ongoing and full time during academic breaks. You would need to be 18. To do this you first find the school you want to attend and they will help you to get a visa. Start this process a year to 18 months in advance because it takes a while to get admitted and then you start to process the visa paperwork.<br>  <br>  You can come to the US as a tourist for six months and while here you could visit schools and make arrangements. But you cannot work on a tourist visa.<br>  <br>  If you study a subject where there is great demand for skilled workers, you could later qualify for an immigrant visa on that basis. If you finish your advanced (Master's) Degree you might be old enough to be interested in marrying someone; if you were the spouse of a citizen you could get permanent residence and after 3 years become a citizen.|`|84fd7e4798193628f44c8efd477cee2caa	you need to be at least 18yrs. old|`|C0lpFqlHaa	Why would you want to move from england?
S3ktbzDNaa	Can't say King? He's the best answer. Obama's changes are too recent (and only a handful of what he will do) to say him and they haven't been with words alone. JFK's were longer ago, but were not as dramatic as other presidents and as good as he was as a speaker, that's not how he changed things. Presidents cause change through speech acts, which are words (spoken or written) infused with the power of their office, not words alone like King used. Although King took actions as well, but words were his strongest weapon.<br>  <br>  <br>  OK, so without them, I might go with John Maynard Keynes, the economist who created the idea behind the New Deal, or perhaps Thurgood Marhall. Before he became a Supreme Court Justice, infusing the authority of 1/9th of the Court behind his words, he was a great lawyer and argued Brown v. Board of Ed successfully, ending segregation (along with a number of other civil rights cases).<br>  <br>  EDIT: Dr. Phil, I almost said Einstein. I decided not to because his words weren't really that persuasive. He wrote down his brilliant ideas and when other people read them, those ideas changed the world. He never really had to use words to convince people. His ideas were so powerful as to be obvious to those who understood them, even as they were still fantastical.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Here's another one: The Beatles. They even influenced communist nations whose people were fascinated that in the West, you could criticize your government without being locked up or killed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Chris Matthews just referred to Keynes. See, he's still influential.

AA10347831	When you entered the US, the officer at the first US airport would issue you I-94. They normally give you an expiration date on your I-94 (6 months to 1 year) As long as you maintain your stay according to your I-94, your expried visa wouldn't be an issue for you to leave the US. Now, if you want to enter the US again, your visa should be current (sometimes your visa would note M for Multiple enter within 1 year, which you can come in or leave the US as many times as you want without any problem) You passport should always be current. To sum up: visa is for entry, I-94 is for leaving, and passport is for showing your citizenship.<br>  <br>  You also need a visa from the UK as well in order to enter their country.|`|a57f3452d9ef1f62cbcc55c95fd107c3aa	If your I-94 is valid, expired US Visa is not a problem.

In order for someone to get something for free, it's been paid by someone else.....in this case it's the taxpayers who are going to have to foot this enormous doctor's bill.<br>  <br>  I have a feeling taxpayers are going to be on the paying end, but never receive the health care provided.  They will still be paying for insurance.  By the time this mess gets to be workable, there will be an income level which would prevent coverage under universaly health care.......and it will eliminate coverage for the middle class worker.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	No, it doesn't matter what kind of contrived economic system you have.  The law of supply and demand cannot be repealed any more than the law of gravity.  <br>  <br>  Everything is finite so if something is free there is nothing limit the demand and demand will outstrip the supply.  Health care is not exempt from this.  There are plenty of examples where Health care is free it has to be rationed.  Which means government bureaucrats have to decide who will be treated now and who will have to wait.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	That's because the people who have such a ***** for it aren't the ones having to pay for it.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Sure can be! As long as you have the guns to force others to pay for it.|`|soImRQy7aa	While I understand the frustration at taxpayers having to formally fund a new health care program for people, I think we have to realize that we taxpayers are already funding health care for these people.  When they get sick, they go to the hospital.  The hospitals can't turn them away, so they treat and bill them.  The poor people don't pay their bills, so hospitals raise prices to compensate for the nonpayers.  Insurance companies then pay the bills and pass the costs on to us.  <br>  <br>  We know that doing prevention and avoiding hospital stays is more cost efficient, so it seems to me that the issue really boils down to whether a program can be developed that will save everyone enough insurance premium money to balance the inevitable tax increase we'll face to pay for it.<br>  <br>  I'd say the jury's still out, but tackling the health care problem as a whole isn't such a sign of socialism as some might like to suggest.|`|Wq8vQqvbaa	There will Never be such a thing as "Free" Health Care.<br>  <br>  Someone, Somewhere has to Pay for the Doctors, Nurses, Hospitals, Medicine, etc...|`|54601f6ca2b038fe7a92154c08ebd2c9aa	Show me one case where the government has done anything effectively.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Thank you for wishing to serve your country.<br>  ROTC= Reserve Officer Training Corps.  It's a system to train new officers for all services.  You sign up for it like any other college class. They provide the uniforms and books.  Note that the AF won't pay for your school unless you qualify for a scholarship.  For that you'll need a great HS GPA, a history of participation in school activities like sports (ideally varsity), student gov't, clubs.  JROTC and Civil Air Patrol would be very positive as well.<br>  You start out as a 2nd Lieutenant.  Your first assignment after graduation will be to a training school to learn your job.  After that, you will move to your first assignment, where you will remain for about three years. Then you'll move to another one.<br>  Promotion to 1st Lieutenant is automatic after 2 years.  Then at the four year point you'll be a Captain.  This one is also automatic unless you've been a substandard performer; it can be delayed/cancelled.  (Yes I've seen it happen.)<br>  How long your commitment is depends on what you do: pilot is ten years, nav/ECO is about seven, most other non-rated specialties are 4-5 years.  At the 20 year point, if you wish you may retire at 50% of your base pay-for life. You also get medical benefits and other stuff as well.  Right now it's the best pension program around, except for maybe the railroads.<br>  Recruiters know NOTHING about ROTC, they will either point you towards enlisting OR Officer Training School. You need to talk to an AFROTC detachment.<br>  If you have other questions, please PM me.|`|f3c8a5f174ca386a6855ce97b71adbfbaa	Definately talk to a recruiter, they'll help a bunch and can answer all your questions.

u1F5RRReaa	I've been wondering this myself. I would've voted for them with Ming at the helm. I think because they felt the urge to copy the tories with their young leader. Clegg is essentially, in terms of style, a Cameron clone, but not nearly as effective. I found Menzies gravitas a lot more engaging than Cleggs bluster.<br>  And why didn't they elect Cable as leader when Campbell stood down, that was the biggest let-off the two major parties ever had.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	All I can say about him is that we never hear anything about him.

The problem is that, whoever is their leader, things look very bad for the Lib Dems at the next election because they are going to get "squeezed" by the two main parties.  In particular, this is because many people are prepared to vote Conservative in order to effect a change of government, which has not been the case at the last three elections.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Lib Dems have a fundamental problem at the moment because they don't know where to position themselves on the political spectrum. Traditionally they sat between a left wing Labour Party and a right wing Conservative Party. Then Labour moved to the centre and the Conservatives to the extreme right, so the obvious place for the Lib Dems to be was on the extrerme left. Things have now changed once more as there are now three parties all trying to occupy the same centre ground, which again means the Lib Dems get squeezed.<br>  <br>  I don't think Clegg is a particularly bad leader, although I am sure many will be thinking that not picking Vince Cable was a missed opportunity.|`|jiBMFeihaa	They have more seats then expected.

They cannot possibly represent “right” and “left” respectively since, under proper scrutiny, they all reveal the same basic characteristics.  In this, we refer to no less an authority than Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, who wrote an entire book on the topic and called it “Leftism: Communism’s Infantile Disorder.”  Indeed the choices Americans must make would be a great deal easier if “truth in labeling” were applied to the political process.

Those who are too young to remember the impact of a program like Carter's (and now Obama) voted against Obama. <br>  We will learn the same lessons all over again the hard way.|`|AA11570618	I wouldn't be shocked at all. Twenty years ago I watched all this unfold, as corruption, avarice, arrogance and hubris took over. Such gluttonous conduct on behalf of our crooked politicians, greedy hedge fund speculators, swindling mortgage lenders, incompetent business leaders, arrogant investment brokers and bozo bankers only served to put us into this economic cesspool we're in now.<br>  The bubble was about to burst; the house of cards was about to collapse....and now it's happened, and all the so-called 'experts' say they "didn't see it coming"! Anytime you prop up an currency with worthless paper (instead of gold or silver), it's bound to eventually cause recession, followed by severe inflation, followed by bankruptcy. People forget what happened in 1929 (and were stupid enough to believe the government when it said, "This can't happen again"). People forget how Germans (in pre-war Nazism) literally needed a wheelbarrow full of cash just to buy a loaf of bread. For our U.S. government to try and resolve this economic crisis by simply throwing more worthless money at it is an insane policy. The U.S.A. has become a nation of gluttonous materialism and consumerism. Citizens "need" more plastic junk from WalMart; big corporate executives "need" multi-million-dollar salaries and bonuses; "big" government "needs" more power and authority to control our society. This has nothing to do with 'leftist' ideologies. It has to do with a national culture gone awry. We've abandoned our moral principles (with the help of cretins like Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern and countless other 'celebrities' who help create hatred and debauchery).<br>  Alexander Tyler once pointed out that, throughout history, the best civilizations have lasted about two hundred years. The U.S.A. is on year 232, and we are on the edge of complete self-destruction.<br>  Even GAO Director David Walker has been conducting his "Fiscal Wake Up Tour" for several years now, talking to anyone who will listen (though few do), warning of the upcoming bankruptcy of the United States of America. We are soon to become a third-world nation where, like Haiti and the Dominican Republic, there will be a handful of the very, very rich - and then there will be the rest of us, the very, very poor. We are ALL to blame for what has happened over the past twenty, thirty, forty or fifty years. It is unfair - and unjust - to blame the 'left' or the 'right'. We're all in this together....and we're all to blame for our own excesses.    -RKO-     03/08/09|`|I0TOw1KSaa	Funny you should say that, because the policies of Reagan's trickle-down economics of 20 years ago are just now bearing fruit, in the form of home foreclosures and the stock market crash.|`|ENsRTdhbaa	are you friken serious?? you just woke up from a 20 year coma??? wow,that must be rough. i cant help you though because that has never happened to me. wow.. 20 years!|`|PJH9vHf1aa	That's a bonehead question.

We are now purging what is toxic so we can make way for the new & better. If your vision of life is a depression than you will get that people I know are all happy, healthy & prosperous. I even have a friend who teachs kids to dance & she said that the parents are happy to pay her for this cause with so much being cut back they can see that keeping their kids in dance makes them happy & that is healthy. So liberals are fine & actually doing well. It seems like many people have no clue as to what it is like to be living an appreciative life filled with joy. Cons. focus so much on fear & guns.While dems are having parties & fun. I purposely detoxed from my job & my husband did the same thing years ago. We decided to live our dreams & our friends told their friends & my husband who has dyslexia yet is able to fix anything went into a handyman business. I have done things I love to do & we are living a great life so why all this doom & gloom taught from cons is something that shows you all are not very wise in knowing that you create your life & your happiness is a choice not your job. Liberals have a prosperity consciousness & know that as we let go, give away, more good can come in. Cons keep saying they give more in charity but they only claim they do. They hold on that is what conservative means. Try holding your breathe, You need to let go to have the new, fresh & vital enter. Liberals wake up to a beautiful life everyday. Even if they lived in the USSR they would be thankful for the earth & sky & that they had toes & eyes. Cons don't get this at all, I know.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	The strongest capitalist superpower on the planet, capitalist America as a whole, not solely the evaporated US "sub-prime mortgage market", is transformed into the most "toxic asset" of the global system.

This dynamite, accumulated during a century of expansions and crises, of wars and revolutions, is now exploding changing the shape of the world in the 21st century.<br>   Nearly two decades ago the disintegration of the USSR was celebrated by capitalism as "the end of communism" and of History itself; now capitalism itself faces its own implosion in its metropolitan centers, in the United States, Europe and Japan.

AND according to the law they made for themselves, they are ALL EXEMPT from being held accountable for any campaign promises. Bush 41 did it when HE said, NO NEW TAXES, and then promptly RAISED old taxes and instituted NEW taxes. In essence, the law Congress voted in, says that anything said by a politician running for office can be totally false, misleading, untrue and unlike any normal citizen, they can not be held accountable. So Obama lied when he said no more earmarks because he knew it would get him votes and by law, he can say this and then do nothing at all to change the way things work.

What about all the maxed out credit cards??  And the soccer moms who bought the big SUVs when a classic sedan would have been plenty.  Yes, the boat has a lot of leaks, but we have been dancing on the deck of the Titantic for a long time.  We did nothing to improve ourselves..we where just  a nation of mass consumption and low production.  Heck, we didnt even build our own homes for petes sake!!  We used the immigrants and temporary workers for that because we all thought we were too good for manual labor.  Like  I said, I could go on forever....Oh yes, AND, Corporations are to blame too...shipping jobs to China and India etc when the USA made them what they are to begin with..people could have stopped that by boycotting their products ( say Levis going to Mexico for example...just buy Wranger or Lee ...but NOOOO gotta have my Levis by god!!

Now, companies and the very wealthy pay very little taxes and it's the middle class that has to pay the lions share.<br>  <br>  The result is that it has set us up as a nation of small businesses.  You are better off setting up a LLC and if it fails, no biggie start another...<br>  <br>  The other main problem, is of course overborrowing - by both individuals and corporate. Even our govt. is way in debt.  I shudder to think what will happen when China comes to ask us to pay up. And we tell them no...

But if you're talking about corporal punishment, we just don't do that anymore and I'm pretty sure there's no chance it will be brought back into use.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	I would agree that the few cases of teachers abusing their powers to discipline their pupils have led to changes in the way teachers have to discipline their classes.<br>  <br>  Discipline is undermined by politically correct considerations, and I believe far too much teaching time is spent simply trying to maintain a degree of order.<br>  <br>  I also think the indiscipline in schools is a reflection of a wider lack of self-control and lack of responsibility in British society.  So it is harder for teachers to establish discipline and focus the pupils' minds on learning, when children have been brought up in what is essentially a chaotic environment.|`|LV8uUmehaa	(Firstly I don't understand your question completely, but here's what I think):<br>  <br>  I'm a 13 year old guy and go to an English public school. It depends on what class I am in, whether there is a cover lesson and who I sit next to which deteres my class behavior. It is the same for most students (others just mis-behave all the time). <br>  <br>  In my English Fastrack class (Or honors) we all behave very well obviously without the small amount of chatter that happens all the time. We are all behaved because we have a good teacher who can teach, and has us very disciplined. This is very different in my French class, which is a top-set class still. In that class we all talk, other students answer back to the teacher and on-call is a daily occurance. To be honest with you, I think that Corporal Punishment along with going to the Military when all 16 year olds leave school. This would give all young people a base of discipline. I think it is very sad when my fellow classmates do not pay attention in class because it is their life they are wasting, and what are they going to do after school.<br>  <br>  I think it is a good thing that the Educational board is awarding stronger minded teachers who can control classes and students. Obviously, some teachers will use their powers in a bad way, but it's like that with every group of people right?|`|G8zAPz8Maa	yes

nQPcbjLKaa	Because there were a lot more men in the West than women so every attempt was made to draw women to the West as equal partners. Also women were often called upon to defend their property and land nearly as much as men, so women were seen as just important as men in raising crops breaking horses and shooting cattle rustlers ;-)|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Before patting themselves on the back read.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a><br>  <br>  In 1848, at the Seneca Falls Convention in New York, activists including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott began a seventy year struggle to secure the right to vote for women. Susan B. Anthony, a native of Rochester, New York, joined the cause four years later at the Syracuse Convention. Women's suffrage activists pointed out that blacks had been granted the franchise and had not been included in the language of the United States Constitution's Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments (which gave people equal protection under the law and the right to vote regardless of their race, respectively). This, they contended, had been unjust. Early victories were won in the territories of Wyoming (1869)[18] and Utah (1870), although Utah women were disenfranchised by provisions of the federal Edmunds-Tucker Act enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1887. The push to grant Utah women's suffrage was at least partially fueled by the belief that, given the right to vote, Utah women would dispose of polygamy. It was only after Utah women exercised their suffrage rights in favor of polygamy that the U.S. Congress disenfranchised Utah women.[19] By the end of the nineteenth century, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming had enfranchised women after effort by the suffrage associations at the state level.<br>  <br>  During the beginning of the twentieth century, as women's suffrage gained in popularity, suffragists were subject to arrests and many were jailed. Finally, President Woodrow Wilson urged Congress to pass what became, when it was ratified in 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment which prohibited state and federal agencies from gender-based restrictions on voting. While the ability to vote was a national trend forming since the progressive years of Republican President William Taft, Wilson's predecessor, Taft's appointment as Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court in 1921 was seen as the watershed moment for equal-pay legislation. Taft's dissenting opinion in Adkins v. Children's Hospital in 1923 was a progressive move and called out a maximum-hours law was equivalent to a minimal-wage. The Supreme Court overturned the decision, to agree with Taft, in 1934 permanently ruling separate hours/rates for women and men as unconstitutional.

Additionally, if there is something that needs doing, like tracking someone, searching for someone, catching them, checking up on them at an overnight job...any or all of these things can throw a scheduled shift out the window.

ANUNMUrlaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  I got arrested for 3 grams of pot in Ontario last summer.  I went to court, and had to do a "diversion" which was 20 hours of community service.  You can choose to either take your diversion, or you can choose to fight it.  If you do fight it, you will need a lawyer, and it will cost you some $$$ and take quite a long time to deal with. You might end up being guilty by association, since your intentions were to smoke the weed anyways, right? Then you don't get offered a diversion, because you are being found guilty of the charges.  You might get probation for this.<br>  <br>  If you do the community service, the charges will be dropped and you won't have a criminal record.<br>  <br>  My question to you is, how the hell did the cop find your pot if you weren't even smoking it?  You do realize that you have the right to not have to answer any question a cop asks you other than your name, age, address, and such.<br>  <br>  Ex:<br>  Cop: What are you doing<br>  You: ....<br>  Cop: Tell me or I'll throw you in jail (he can't)<br>  You: Here is my ID<br>  <br>  Cops are masters of getting you to talk.

Jm3vMKx3aa	An interview before the issue of a visa is required for citizens of the countries which are not allowed to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver program. But don't think that will be a long session; the interviews are scheduled in a 5-minute scheme and all the consular officer wants is to get convinced that the apllicant will retun to his country after the visit and does not stay in the United States illegally or for other purposes than tourist travel or business.<br>  Now back to British citizens; they do not need a visa for a tourist trip of up to 90 days. The only thing that has changed is that you have to apply for a travel authorization to use the Visa Waiver Program. The application made on the website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires the same information that must be provided on the green Form I-94W which has to filled out in the airplane and has to be presented to the Immigration Officer together with the passport. It takes only a few minutes and is free of any charges. The approval may take up to three days in exceptional cases but is in general granted on the spot.<br>  If you you have any doubts to be granted access to the United States I would recommend to use a two leg flight via Ireland. Book a cheap flight to Dublin or Shannon and start your travel to the United States from there. Why? Dublin and Shannon have so called U.S. Preclearence Facilites. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are stationed in Ireland and the U.S. Immigration procedures are done before the airplane departs. So you are sure that you are granted access to the US before arriving there. At present customs procedures cannot be done in Ireland yet; so you have to go through customs on the U.S. arrival airport but the passport controls are eliminated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://london.usembassy.gov/cons_new/visa/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://london.usembassy.gov/cons_new/vis...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/archives/legacy/2002/82002/08132002_2.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/contacts/preclear_locations.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/conta...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/esta_advisory.ctt/esta_advisory.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/trav...</a><br>  <a href="http://dublin.usembassy.gov/nivwaiver.html" rel="nofollow">http://dublin.usembassy.gov/nivwaiver.ht...</a>|`|a57f3452d9ef1f62cbcc55c95fd107c3aa	There are 2 ways to enter US as UK Citizen. <br>  1.

Everything comes out in favor of using the bombs.|`|4zijn0cgaa	Because we could have learned to speak Japanese after being taken over by them and could have learned to bow before them also.|`|I0TOw1KSaa	Fill in the details of your own homework, but the gist of it is this.<br>  <br>  The Emperor of Japan was in discussions for peace.  The sticking point was over surrender.  See, the Japanese don't believe in surrender.  They would have been okay with a peace treaty that didn't have the Emperor surrendering to the Allies. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the Russians had just defeated the Nazis in Europe and were in the process of re-mobilizing for Japan.  They had taken the Kuril Islands north of Japan, and we did not want the Soviets to be involved in the occupation and peace of Japan, because we saw that they were preparing to occupy Eastern Europe for the long haul and we didn't want to share Japan with them in the same way.  The Atomic Bomb made it possible for us to tell them "we got this."  <br>  <br>  Also, the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima -- the target was the steeple of the Christian cathedral, by the way -- but the audience was Russia.  We had told Stalin at Yalta that we had a new, terrible weapon, and he kind of brushed it off.  By destroying Hiroshima, we were declaring to Russia our capabilities.  <br>  <br>  This was moot, though: we didn't realize, at the time, that Russian spies knew all about the bomb long before we even finished it.|`|5pioWG30aa	OK, its easy to second guess our political and military leaders over 60 yrs later. But we were at war, Japan attacked us first.  Our intel said the Japanese were also developing an atom bomb.  It's history, why question it?  Truman made the right decision, and over million allied troops didn't have to invade the Japanese homeland. Perhaps you're alive today, because your grandfather didn't die in battle.|`|0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	Didn't we cut off their supply lines|`|Bkl0515eaa	Using any type of weapon in deliberate, indiscriminate attacks against civilians was and is against the rules, customs, and laws of war, as described in the Geneva Conventions, Hague Conventions, a 1938 League of Nations Resolution, a 1961 UN resolution (General Assembly 1653), and the Just War tradition of the Roman Catholic Church dating back hundreds of years. The purpose and effect of the bombs was not to destroy military personnel or weapons, but to cause as much civilian death and devastation as possible in order to intimidate the Japanese government into surrender. If somebody did that to us, we would call it terrorism.<br>  <br>  Some may argue that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were in fact military targets, containing manufacturing facilities, and in the case of Nagasaki a naval base. But then, why were the bombardier aiming points the exact centers of both cities? It would be the functional equivalent of aiming for Staples Center in Los Angeles to take out Raytheon 10 miles to the west and JPL 10 miles to the Northeast, along with hundreds of thousands of civilians in between. Or aiming for downtown Norfolk to take out Norfolk Naval Base 5 miles to the north. It may take decades or centuries, but eventually the hypocrisy of the US slaughter of German and Japanese civilians will be acknowledged.<br>  <br>  Whether or not they were about to surrender is irrelevant because by 1945 they were no longer a strategic military threat. Japan is an island nation, and its strategic offensive capability is based entirely on naval power. By 1945 Japan's navy was on the bottom of the Pacific. We had 30 heavy aircraft carriers (Essex class and similar) to their none. We had 10 new battleships (Iowa and South Dakota classes) and 15 older battleships (North Carolina, Colorado, and Pennsylvania classes) to their none. We had hundreds of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines to their less than fifty. We had 30,000 aircraft in the Pacific and 40,000 in Europe to their 5,000. We had 30 million tons of commerical merchant ships to their 1 million tons (soon to be zero thanks to our submarines). Looking at these numbers, you don't have to be an Annapolis graduate to see that they were not a threat. The US Navy had Japan completely surrounded. Nothing was getting in or out, they were completely cut off. Without steel and oil, they could only build wooden ships powered by sails and oars. No matter how you slice it, they were done, even if their leaders (and ours?) were too dumb and stubborn to see it. We could have maintained a strategic quarantine on them for decades with no trouble, and they would be confined to their little islands for as long as we felt necessary.<br>  <br>  An invasion would have been a senseless waste of lives. Such a costly action would only be morally justified to eliminate a dire threat to our nation. Using atomic bombs to stop a senseless invasion is also, by definition, senseless. By that time of the war, Japan was not a threat. Unconditional surrender was not rqeuired to maintain our security for the simple reason that Japan's armed forces were completely crushed. Invasion or atomic bombs served only one real purpose: revenge.|`|3ixmHSwmaa	Doesn't work.<br>  <br>  Invade Japan = over twenty thousand dead Americans<br>  <br>  Drop bomb = no dead Americans<br>  <br>  It was a war, remember?<br>  <br>  Oh, and Japan attacked America first.|`|jGAX8sSlaa	We just didn't have the man power to keep island hoping with Japan so that would mean the A-bomb was indeed necessary. now the second one was not so necessary but it had already been sent before Japan surrendered.|`|tp9ZBWEtaa	The US had pretty much won the war anyway, the choices were either invading Japan or dropping the bombs.

Emq9jEc1aa	My good friend and ally,<br>  <br>  My country has changed, dramatically and drastically. While our history together as brothers, then enemies, then brothers again has been costly but mutually rewarding, my side of the pond has now thrown in the towel. I find myself questioning, daily now, "would we ALL have been better to simply acquiesce to King George, accepted the cost along with the benefit, and remained a colony of Britain?" I don't know, but given the direction my country is taking today, the answer is most likely "bloody-well yes."<br>  <br>  Until further notice, we are a lost cause. While you will get support from a majority of individual American citizens, you will not get support from our Country, and certainly not our President (in fact, he will probably tell you why you should just be quiet and go along, hope and change, and all). <br>  <br>  As a whole, we are too stupid, and too lazy to grasp our own destiny now, so it is probably best that you not look to us to help you achieve yours. <br>  <br>  I love Britain. I love America more. I love our alliance, and the fact that we lead the free world together, for so long. But we are no longer an advantage for you, or the cause of freedom throughout the world. In fact, we are a burden, and as much as I want to be a part of bearing the flag for liberty, alongside my long-time friend and ally, we are no longer worthy. Soon, we will no longer be significant either.<br>  <br>  Thank you for my heritage, our history, and your support and allegiance over the years. While we had to fight and rebel to become stronger, those battles did indeed make us both stronger, and I can only hope that one day, a new country will rise from our ashes, one worthy of Britain's allegiance again, and one as strong and viruous as England and her people.<br>  <br>  God Save the Queen. God Hold Britannia, God Bless America, and best of luck to you as you fight on, and leave us behind.<br>  <br>  We had a good run, but we can only weigh you down now. Fight on, and live free.|`|MLEqranDaa	His teleprompter is broken.|`|nz8U5rNaaa	Well me personally, I don't like it, but there is a difference between Ireland and England and the Native Americans. I live just off the Apache reservation and the Native Americans have all signed treaty's and the government genocide has long been over. Now I am under the impression that all of Ireland is still part of the British empire and they want to be fully free. I certainly may be wrong on the current state of this, but in general if Ireland was fully free at one time and then was occupied by the British then they have a right to fight back just like the colonies did in 1776. Now with that said I am talking about the Irish government declaring their freedom and fighting back not a few dissidents. The countries government would need to stand up to be considered freedom fighters.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	I have the same opinion as you do. Unfortunately, Pres. Obama has very little credibility among anyone who has a functioning brain.<br>  I have a special love for Great Britain. Two very special families, the Clark's and Colliers who lived in London. I was a Lieutenant in the New York State Prison System. While studying, I had the opportunity to go on a Criminal Justice Seminar to London. I met two men, Prison Officer Peter Clark, Dog Handler, and P.O. John Collier, Hospital Officer<br>  from Wormwood Scrubs Prison in London. We hit it off and became close friends, I took my wife across to England an spent a fortnight with both families, they in turn came across to New York and spent <br>  time with us. Unfortunately, both of these men died, one from a heart attack and the other from diabetes. There is a large population of people of Irish decent who hate the British. I call them Ignorant Micks.<br>  My descendants are from Scotland, Montrose, and Arbroath, Ireland and France. Not in love with the French, cannot stomach them. I am sorry for the loss of your soldiers and for the innocent people who have died over the years. Protestants and Catholics, says alot about their <br>  love of God. I no longer live in the United Socialist States of America.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	well pete, the problem with your analogy is america is STILL committing genocide on indigenous peoples here. google toxic waste and reservations or american indians. you will see that the new weapon against us is to kill us and future generations. the forced sterilizations that occurred right up through the 1980s are something most non native americans don't have a clue about. yet you are shocked that they are ill informed about your country or any other country? they don't know the truth about their own!<br>  <br>  maybe soon with a government that appears at least to want to uncover all that was hidden, they may see what this country is all about. i'm not holding my breath. its very difficult to see anything with a flag wrapped tightly around one's head.

Both are hypocrites to the extreme and can't say anything when you question them.|`|bE27Kduyaa	My interest in the Libertarian Party came about in a very similar way.  I always voted for Republicans until I woke up and realized that they weren't looking out for my civil liberties.  In fact, I am looking to run for Congress in 2010 as a Libertarian.  Both major parties are only looking to grab more power for themselves and don't really care about you or me.  We need more people in Congress that will stand up for our rights.  Maybe then the Constitution will actually mean something.  So, congratulations on finding the truths in libertarianism.  If you would like some reading material to learn more about libertarian principles, let me know.
ljRE5MeAaa	Saul Alinsky, author of "Rules for Radicals" was a huge influence in his Community Organizing techniques.<br>  Rev.

Alaska - well, I lived there for a year and can honestly tell you that they somehow manage to get the federal government to pay for everything so they don't have a state sales tax and hand out the money they make from the pipeline to their citizens. They'd have to implement a sales tax and put pipeline proceeds into the general fund if they liked having things  like roads. This would immediately either cause a massive revolution in the new country of Alaska or they'd all move to fly-ins so the tax man couldn't get to them. <br>  <br>  I give Alaska a much better chance at surviving as an independent entity than I give Texas, btw.

We also have plenty of oil, but we're moving more toward alternative energy anyway, which is one reason we're not actively drilling some of our biggest reserves. We like to keep a "clean house" here. So while there would be  some rough spots, Cali is another state that could do  well as an independent entity.<br>  <br>  Not that any of this matters much to me.

This system, run by banks, and chief among them the CENTRAL BANK, dispenses new money into the system by lending it.  No new money can enter the system unless there is a borrower with collateral, and proven ability to pay back the loan with interest. This has pitfalls and traps whenever you only loan out ONLY the PRINCIPAL, borrowers (individuals, business, and GOVs) all compete with each other to pay back the bank the Intrest...kinda like a sick game of musical chairs. Right now...there ain't enough chairs to properly sit upon.<br>  <br>  Now, that being said...let's take a look at Mr. Obama's positioning, by others, as, The next Lincoln...<br>  <br>  Lincoln, before John Wilkes Booth caught up with him at Ford's theater, was working with a then-Senator Carey on a monetary bill that, if passed in 1865, would have changed around the monetary system so that any new created money would be spent directly into the economy, making that dollar NOT ONLY NOT have the onus of intrest laden debt tacked onto it (making each next created dollar's power smaller and smaller) BUT embue that dollar created and spent into the economy with the INTRINSIC VALUE of the product that dollar purchased, retaining that value at the point of exchange all through the determined life of that bill......and then a FAIRer TAX collection system (unfortunately, he could only come up with income tax...but dont hold that against Abe) to take it out of the economy again for destruction.<br>  <br>  Every single president since Jackson (the only president to have the country DEBT-FREE, if only for two weeks) wants the country DEBT-FREE, and for the most part, they are limited by the tools they have at their disposal to do it...as well as the advisors that happen to be advising him.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, privately...Obama wants FAIR TAX put in...but to you and me, he may be blinded by 'liberal ideaology's platitudes (trappings!) into doing just what liberal philosophy wants.....or at least he wants his circle to think he's drinking the same kool-aid as they want him to, smiling with an approving wink when they feed him the line that they too are drinking the kool-aid, and isn't the kool-aid we are all drinking good?!  <br>  <br>  His 'circle' being the economists and politicians, that would eat him alive if the words 'Fair Tax' ever passed his lips within thier earshot (circle's ears being sensitive enough to hear an ant fart 100 miles away, but not enough to hear you and me) , without a disdainful attitude or noticable negative gesture...<br>  <br>  My guess is....he's a tasty guppy in a roomful of hungry, fat ravenous sharks, and he knows it....and he's gotta feed them SOMETHING (namely our wallets) or he's the next course of an unending dinner.  <br>  <br>  If he tries to feed them Fair tax...it's like feeding Liver to Fonzie (Aaaaaay!.....from the TV show happy Days) He'll run away from it and start looking hungry for the guppy, namely HIM. <br>  <br>  FairTax to congress (republican, yes, but, Specifially Democratic-controlled congress steeped in Liberal thought (and cherished blindspots hiding nasty pitfalls, because they want the other side to fall in first, so they can walk over them)) ...the very idea of giving up control over the exclusions-feature for their lobbyist buddies(who write code part-time for members)  in the dreaded 66,000 page tax code that no one wants to read (even if they could), by scrapping the tax code and replacing it with something that would act like the biggest economic stimulis in the world - never mind they could try re-acquiring the monetary creation control back from FedRsv, that they gave up to them in 1913 -  the fair tax is viewed as Kryptonite to their Superman.<br>  <br>  Obama's wishing he had Huck's number on speed dial without them knowing about it, or even himself, lest the circle finds out, to prevent him dialing it.<br>  <br>  There, now you can gather that Obama can do worse, never mind whether he wants to or not...because He's not REALLY in control...his advisers are....<br>  <br>  Obama says fairtax '...needs further study...' he says that to get him off the hook. but you knew that already, didn't you?|`|61a706a96992f304450dbded47628ddbaa	Can you fix all our problems in such a short amount of time?

I'd have thought it was compulsory.<br>  <br>  Why would you call the cops, you little tattle tale?|`|IYdgEQ4kaa	Of course it's legal if you have a license to sell tobacco accessories.. And why would you call 911? A good motto...don't bring harm unto others kid...bad karma.
3oNcHdgCaa	No such law, unless there's a child or some other dependent involved. Even the police aren't legally obligated to protect any individual from harm, and can't be successfully sued by a citizen if they fail or refuse to render assistance.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think we should prosecute all the mothers who allow their a$$hole boyfriends and husbands to abuse their kids and look the other way just because they're afraid to go out and get a job.|`|RYCMFLMuaa	most will help but thats the police job.
cz5XbKfOaa	The food stamp program is only a supplement program. This is why it was recently renamed "SNAP" or Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. The program was never intended to supply a families entire months worth of groceries even though that is what people need. The best thing to do is find ways to reduce your monthly food bill. I use The Grocery Game at www.thegrocerygame.com . It has helped my family greatly reduce our costs.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	Because people should be working for a living and supporting themselves instead of being a welfare recipient.<br>  <br>  George Bush didn't hate helping poor people... he, like most Americans, hates supporting generation after generation of people who feel that they are 'entitled' to get a 'free ride' and not have to work.<br>  <br>  Quit whining and get a job.|`|KVlRYoidaa	because some illegal aliens are getting it also.
Yc6eUIW9aa	It's not a violation but your starting off on the wrong foot since he is your probation officer and let you know he would be there anytime until 2.  He probably meant not good that your starting off like that like you don't care.<br>  ..|`|RYCMFLMuaa	No u dont have to be home at 10 am ok... screw them. report him to the state.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	I don't know that it counts as a violation, but he is right about it being not good.  You should have waited for him as instructed.  Being on probation will sometimes be inconvenient and you will have to adjust your schedule to suit you PO.  That is your punishment for breaking the law.<br>  <br>  Call your PO, apologize for your mistake (don't try to excuse it) and promise to do better next time.  Realize that if you don't follow the rules of your probation, you will go to jail.|`|1yIXkBwwaa	Its pretty serious. I think TI went through the same hassle. Call attorney Mark Geragos unless he's too busy with Chris Brown.|`|RSbn5STjaa	No, but he obviously expected you to be there until 2.|`|ogMZmPqaaa	Sounds like you need to learn how to tell time, 10:00 am doesn't sound like 2:00 pm to me.
RYCMFLMuaa	you can go to jail ... at 15 u wont .|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Depends what country you are in. UK it is legal to have sex, vote, go to jail if you commit a crime, leave school, get married, get a full time job, rent  your own house.
cO9lH8f6aa	Viagra and which candidate needed it the most.|`|f2sSkPiyaa	McCain was too old.
