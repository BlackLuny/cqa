If you were flat chested, then lost weight, then started taking the pill and then regained the weight while you are on the pill (and your hormones are different) is it possible that your body would store the fat in a different place than usual?

20090307180320AAxd8VD	Health;Women's Health	What is the best way to adjust my birth control schedule with the time change?	I take my pill every day at 8:15 a.m., but with the time change coming up I would have to make it 9:15 a.m. every day to keep exactly on track.  However, an hour can really make a difference; 8:15 is just a lot more convenient of a time for me to take my pill.      Would it be better to bring myself down an hour gradually (i.e. taking my pill 15 minutes earlier each day until I'm back to taking it at 8:15) or does it really not matter if I just continue on as normal and allow my pill time to be offset by an hour the day of the time change?      I've been getting along really well (no side effects, no problems at all) by keeping myself on such a strict schedule, and I don't want to blow it by knocking my schedule off by an hour, you know?

And i'm on this thing "Raiders" for JROTC if you know what it is, it's a really tough work out, involves a lot of running.   But the season is over, and it starts next year, so I was the SLOWEST in the team, And my coach told me to keep practicing onn the running only. Because that's my weak nest.   So I've been running like 2 and a half miles sometimes 3 times a week or 5 day a week.   But I wanna lose weight too, I can do correct push ups, and sit ups. And I do 30 or more push ups every night. And the arm muscle that I have in my arm is all from push ups.    And from all this I've already lost a lot of weight, But still i look fat you know. So I wanna get rid of that. I dont really care about gaining muscle.      Also, I drink a lot of water and run at nights like at 7 to 8. Is it good to run like at 7 or 8pm.

20090307223330AA94pGi	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Think I have mono, but no swollen nodes or throat pain?	Ok, so a lot of my friends have had mono lately, I think I might be getting it too. I have had a lot of fatigue, and I little fever, but I have waited a week and a half since that started and I haven't got the normal Swollen nodes or sore throat that comes with mono!        Is it possible to have mono without those two symptoms?      Oh and some of my family members will likely get it because before I had symptoms I had been sharing drinks with them. Even though they don't have symptoms, because Mono has a 4-7 month period after you contract it where there is no symptoms, will a blood test still show the right results before the symptoms!? So they can know whether or not they have it?      All answers are appreciated,      Thanks!! :)
20090307223155AAgKLiQ	Health;Mental Health	Do I have a strange memory?	Well, to start it off, I can't remember stuff very well, especially if it was just told to me. But if I can remember something, it plays back in my mind from a different angle from where I was. For example: I tried to remember where I put something in my room, and instead of seeing my every move from my eyes, I saw my every move from a corner in the ceiling of my room. This happens a lot. For pretty much everything that I try to remember. Is this normal?      P.S. I know that I have other things to ask, but I seriously can't remember what they are.

When you have friends or someone who says enough things to you to cut you like a knife, these are the things most remembered by anyone that you meet in life. Be careful what you say to others it can destroy relationships, stop possible friendships, and make you the biggest jerk in the world.

20090307233205AAPslHv	Health;Dental	Not sure if anyone would know this offhand, but here goes?	Many dentists administer epinephrine along with topical anesthetics. This is done (from what I understand) to induce vasoconstriction, which in turn, prolongs the effects of the numbing agent.      (for those whom may be wondering, I am asking this question to give me time. It is the weekend and no dentists are available)      Since I do not have access to any synthesized products    which induce vasoconstriction I am short of options. All I could come up with was caffeine to act as a vasoconstrictor.      My question: Does anyone know of anything besides caffeine which may aide in this process to increase the duration benzocaine?      Thanks.

20090307232733AAUiP6l	Health;Mental Health	I'm finally visiting a close friend... yet it seems like I can't enjoy my time here?	I've already been diagnosed with depression, I have been recommended to get meds but I'm talking to my parents later on tomorrow about it before I'm put on it.  I'm currently at one of my closest friend's apartment, having drove 4 hours to visit for the weekend and am going back later tomorrow.        We spent all day touring the city, roadtripping, and watching an amazing musical.  And yet on the way back I had to try to keep myself from crying the last hour or so... while maintaining normal speaking tone with my friend to keep them from worrying.  I don't know what to do to make myself feel better, I won't get to see her for another month at least and want to enjoy my time with her.  The problem is all I can think of is when I finally leave tomorrow how much I'm going to miss her and how much better it is that at least I know I have a friend to miss rather then no friends at all (how I felt about 2 weeks ago before I got help).      Is there ANYTHING I can do to just enjoy myself?  I feel so bad right now, I feel like I'm wasting my time here, that there's no point since I will be leaving tomorrow and will probably never see her again (she's going back to the east coast after this internship here).  I already miss her.  I don't know what to do...

20090307230014AAm4Uud	Health;Diet & Fitness	Simple Diet Question...?	Okay, so I'm 24, male, 6'4'' and 255 pounds. I like to hit about 200 pounds at some point. I did some talking with my doctor, and he said to keep at my current weight, I'd need to eat like 3500 calories a day, that's without any exercises. I've worked out a pretty healthy diet with the help of my companies nutritionist and it's around 1500-1600 calories a day, plus spending time at the gym every other day. Now my question is kind of simple...what kind of results can I expect? I don't want to lose a lot just to gain it back, I want it to be steady but not extreme. Is 2 pounds a week a reasonable goal?

20090308001359AAqVH8t	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is it normal to feel this way when dieting?	I feel dizzy. Whenever I stand up I black out a little. Is this healthy? I'm not starving myself or anything. I eat 1600 or 1700 calories and run 3 miles every other day. I'm a teenager (16), so I am especially careful not to dip below 1500. Anyways, if my sedentary caloric needs are 1800, I've calculated an average caloric deficit of 300 a day, which  means that I'll be losing less than a pound a week. How is it possible that my weight loss is so slow, but I still feel its effects?

20090307232500AA2zk6n	Health;Women's Health	Help? Please? Ten points to best answer!?	Let me start off by saying that my Mother tells me that irregular periods are the norm in my family, and usually start to even out after we have our first child.. with that said, when I got my first period at 12, and had an irregular cycle, not much thought was put into it.    My first period was normal, and my second one came the next month like clockwork. After that, however, my period slowly got erradic. It came ever other month, then ever other two months. Every now and again, I would get a cycle right after another, but very rarely. I consulted my Dr, who wasn't worried about it at the time. When I started dating someone around age 15, my period went almost six months without another one. I figured it was stress. It kinna then returned to normal.. until I got put on birthcontrol a month before my sixteenth birthday. My Dr. told me that I didn't have any cysts when I got checked out for my prescription for the Ortho Evra patch. I was told to wait until my period came to start it. One night, I was messing around with my b/f, and was spotting when I got home. I took it as a sign of my period, and started the patch that night. The next day, I wasn't bleeding at all. Shortly therafter, I started to bleed heavily for three weeks straight. I had blood clots and everything.. I pretty much thought I was having a miscarriage, so I didn't really think too much of it. I wish I had. Ever since then, my periods have been REALLY messed up, but have gotten worse in the last two years. I virtually never bleed. The last few times I got my period were brought on by birthcontrol. My last cycle was almost a year ago. I haven't been on bc since. I have rare, occasional spotting. Also, every now and again, I feel a tenderness OR tightness in the area of my right ovary. I don't expirience any kind of pain during intercourse. Sometimes, however, I get short, painful cramps that last no more than a few minutes. I'm not sure if this is relavant or not, but I always seem to be thirsty and pee  alot. I can go twice in an hour if not more sometimes. I gained alot of emotional weight last year, and recently have taken pretty much it all off, and it seems like I'm even more thirsty now. I get occasional light cramping and breast tenderness too. Kind of like pms symptoms, but never any bleeding to accompany it. I'm scared ****less, but have been without health insurance for the last two years. I pretty much have no way to see a doctor. Do you have any idea what could be going on with me? I tried taking vitex for a few months, and it didn't bring my period on. Any help is much appreciated. Thanx =)

She also says that her legs need to be constantly moving or that it would feel good if a fat person sat on them ??! lol i know thats funny... but she thinks she might have hypoglycemia because her father has that, however she had eaten alot today and i was thinking it could have been that she and i ate sweets and we split a large ice coffee. For a while when she told me about derealization i was thinking that perhaps she has an anxiety disorder, because i have one and i know that derealization doesnt usually occur without some sort of anxiety disorder. so any thoughts people ?

20090307235310AAu4Gwc	Health;Mental Health	I am a psychotherapist but I do not deal in any kind of psychopharmacy. I have been diganosed with ADD .......?	I have had it my whole life.I used to be called a procrastinator. But, I am very high achieving and would generally get everything done. My Psychology and Therapy Proffessors would always laugh and call me their Type A- ADD student. I really only lack in one area and that is motivation. It is horrible and I end up just feeling miserable about it.      Every few months or so my Dr. gives me a prescription for diet pills Yes, lord I need to lose about 50. I dont take them every month. But, when I do take them something biological happens. Its like my body has been thirsting for this. So, I get motivated and stay motivated. It is great for me and my family.      So, my question is this.. I have heard of meds given to people like me that have ADD. Is whats in it an upper or an amphetamine? Let me say that I do not have ADHD at all. I just have the distracted kind. I think I am high functioning and noone really knows. Its a full tims job hiding this from the people I can.      I just would like to be normal and not get so overwhelmed and stimulated with chaous and such.      If you have a personal story you want to share or any info on this I would greatly appreciate it.

20090307231609AA9qWP5	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	6 year old hit head/instant and extreme swelling to brow bone- Doctor?	My 6 year old daughter was playing with a 4 year old boy today, running around in circles and she hit her head on the back of his head.  Within 2 minutes, a huge soft lump appeared on her brow bone.  No skin was broken and she didn't show signs of a concussion.  Her vision and everything else is fine other than this gigantic lump that is now forcing her eye to close more and more.      I called ask-a-nurse and they recommended the E.R. (which I'm pretty sure they legally have to since that's all they ever say)  I decided not to bring her tonight and instead kept it iced and gave her ibuprofen.        I'm alarmed at the rate the swelling occurred and I want to know if that is normal for an injury to this area.  I suppose I'll know whether I need to take her in when she wakes up but I'm trying to do some online research and couldn't find much.  Does anyone have any information on this type of injury?      Thank you!       (also, the lump is between the size of a marble and a grape)

I exercise often, am not overweight, and do exercises for good posture (abs, push-ups, shoulder work) but it seems like this small middle area doesn't get worked-and I realize only after doing work in the kitchen. Do you know any home exercises (without weight machines) I can do to make it stronger? Thanks

20070102211221AA23AvD	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Is it possible to lose your depth of vision?	My husband has no depth of vision at all.  I watch him try and try and try to reach for something before he actually gets it.  Lately I have noticed that I can't judge how far away something is!  The other day I had a hair hangingn off my arm, and I wanted to get it off.  I tried to grab it a few times and I couldn't get my hands on that hair!  I had to rub my arm against my shirt to get that stupid hair to fall off!  I have noticed that when I put my contacts on I don't see as clear as I used to.  It's progressively gotten worse since I had my child.  I'm not due for a check-up yet, and I'm not that concerned or surprised that my vision is getting blurrier.  But the fact that lately I can't judge how far away or close something is is really bothering me!  Is this even possible?  Can someone lose their depth of vision?  Is this a sign of something more serious?  Should I call the eye doctor?  I'm really worried here...
20070315190838AA6qBWQ	Health;Women's Health	Someone please answer this...I'm dying over here!?	I got the IUD put in three days ago and have anked so many questions about it on here since! At first the pain was so intense, I wasn't even able to walk at times. I was taking ibuprofen like candy just to handle it. Right up until last night the pain started to subside. Then this morning I woke up feeling ill. No fever, though. I felt this same way when I had mastitis just after I had my baby. But I have no fever and there is no blood. I swear something is wrong though! Could I get an infection or a perferation or something and have no pain? I can't feel the strings either, can't find them for the life of me. I would think if it perferated through the uterus i would be in more pain and there would be blood and a fever. How do I get the doctor to take me seriously that I know something has to be wrong if there is no blood and I don't have a fever. The doctor said to call back if I have either one of those and I don't. I feel so awful! So how do I get them to listen to me?

It is not diabetes because today I had a snickers bar and still felt the same way.  Could it be because I go to bed at 4 in the morning almost every night?

Does going to sleep at 10pm and waking up at 10am make you "feel better" than going to sleep at 4am and waking up at 2pm?

Spring Break is around the corner and i want to look good in my bathing suit and also i want to look good for my prom that is coming up in a month.  I desperately need to learn how to curb myself.  I can't go on like this.  If i can't control myself now, college is going to kill me.

20090227123654AAcM3Dr	Health;Mental Health	Why am I seeing something that is not there. Why are my eyes playing tricks on me?	At night when Im in bed I sleep with my t.v. on. Sometimes I drift off to sleep and maybe wake up 30 mins to an hour later so I can turn on my side. As I wake up to turn over I open my eyes sometimes most of the time I close them and drift back off to sleep. Well twice I think I have experienced my eyes playing tricks on me. Last night and about a year ago I opened my eyes to turn over on my side and I see a HUGE spider crawling away from my body!!! It scares me to death to where I scream so loud. Another time almost about 6 months ago I got a full night 7 hours of sleep. When I opened my eyes that morning I seen a spider right by my face. When this happens I jump up and scream and run out of the room. I dont know if this is real or not! Something tells me that it's all in my head.       After my incident last night my husband came in our room to check the whole bed and under the bed for a spider. He didnt see anything and just told me that it's all in your head. Why is this happening to me? And I wouldnt see why it is happening to me because I never think about spiders or bugs before I sleep. I may have a huge fear of them ... but agian... I do not think about insects before I sleep.

I've been using the nicotine patches and I find them brilliant - so much better than they were a few years ago.  I've been wearing the patches overnight because my hardest cigarette to overcome is the first one of the day.  As I was warned, my sleep has been very disturbed with lots of vivid (although not unpleasant dreams) and waking up regularly.  I've now stopped wearing them because I find I've been feeling really really tired.  Is this because my sleep has been too light and I've simply been deprived of a decent nights sleep?   Hope I make sense.

Premier problème, je n'aime pas parler, mais bon, ?a, à la limiote, je m'en fous, le seul soucis, c'est qua quand j'ai pas le choix, je bafouille, je cherche mes mots, et je parle vite, donc personne ne me comprend...mais bon...   le soucis, c'est que je ne supporte pas d'entendre des gens parler...que les personnes soient au téléphone ou autour de moi, ?a m'énerve... plus le temps passe, pire c'est...je ne sais pas trop à quoi c'est du, mais ?a m'énerve parce que je prends toute cette nervosité sur moi sans l'extérioriser, et les trois quarts du temps, je ne peux pas partir, je dois supporter en silence toutes les personnes qui discutent autour de moi (et même si je parle, ?a m'énerve, donc ben...je ne sais plus trop quoi faire pour gérer ce problème ^^)

I woke up this morning and my cramps were so bad I screamed to my dad because I thought my appendix exploded, I pointed to where it hurt and the first thing he asked me was "... are you on your period because that's not where your appendix is" ( Dads a nurse) And I got my period just this morning so it was my period.      I was standing in the shower and the pain was so bad I had to sit on the shower floor and screamed at the top of my lungs it hurt so bad ( YOU LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD IT HURT) I stepped out of the shower and couldnt even walk the pain was getting so bad (no i didn't have a tampon in) Then it was to the point it hurt so bad I just started puking everywhere. My dad gave me two extreme motrin for migraines and it only lasted 3 hours ( you're only supposed to take 1 at the most for adults)       I'm so annoyed... The pain is absolutely unbearable and is effecting my attendance at school, sports and my soccer team. I also get really bad diarhea when I get my period. Anyone have any idea's or helpful tips to keep the pain away ( hot water baths dont work)

20090227124642AA3xO41	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Marijuana and pain relief?	To users of medical marijuana:          I have been using marijuana recently (twice in the last two weeks) for recreation and have found that it has helped a severe pain in my hand.           My hand, more specifically the tip of the finger between the pinky and index finger, intermittently goes into a wild pain that is not only excruciating but debilitating. I went to a orthopologist and he was at a loss to tell me what I have, he figured there was an initial injury that made my hand hurt and because my hand hurt I stopped using it. This neglect of my hand has led to its current state.          With that in mind I use it as much as possible but it still hurts to the point where I have to take dangerous amounts of over-the-counter painkillers (8 to 12 at a time on some occasions) to even function. I don't want to take any more pills and I don't want to take any prescription ones either, I just wanted to know:          -What would be a reasonable amount to take for my pain? (the less I have to smoke, the better... I enjoy it, but i want to keep my job!)         -What strains of cannabis are bred specifically for pain relief, if any?         -What are the necessary steps to a get a medical marijuana license?

20090227124732AA4IwdZ	Health;Other - Health	Why am I sleeping so much?	I'm having a problem with sleeping a lot and always being tired. This has gone on ever since I was maybe 14. I can sleep for 8 to even 12 hours and still wake up and want to go right back to sleep. Even if I get a ton of sleep at night I need to take a nap halfway thru the day because I'm so tired. I don't feel like I'm actually rested when I wake up either. My boyfriend is constantly on my case saying that I sleep too much and calls me lazy. I don't think I'm lazy, I'm just horribly tired all the time.      I don't have insurance so I can't go see a doctor/specialiast about it and I'm not eligible for medicaid out here in CA. I don't know what to do. I've tried nyquil and tylenol PM and both of them still leave me exhausted when I wake up.      I don't always have dreams so that can't be keeping me awake and there's not a lot of noise and such to do that either. Is there someone that has experience with this or possibly even a medical expert of some kind that could give me some free advice? I can't afford to see a doctor either or I'd do that.

They are on both legs, below the knees, itch alot and also burn sometimes. They sores are red and around them the skin is white.  They are also a few others on my body but not as bad as on my legs. Both legs are covered in them and each sore is about the size of a dime. Some smaller some bigger.      Anybody know what this is? I was searching online and found maybe that this is Psoriasis?

20070507103323AAFkwdv	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Drinking on Adderall?	I tried posting this question up last time. I don't want these uneducated worry-warts commenting on how bad drinking is or drinking, OK? I'm looking for factual information.      OK, I drink fairly habitually through the day, because I work at home. I sip on beers or wine or Brandy, usually. It's just my lifestyle, but I don't get drunk, I just enjoy it. I was recently prescribed Adderall for my concentration problems. Due to the money I chose the generic brand (same, and it's instant release). I have felt no problems yet doing this, but I want make sure the combination will not be dangerous for my liver or heart rythems, or the combination will not create a different chemical in my body (as is the case with cocaine for example).       Thank you, please, educated comments only.            -William

Yo ya soy pesta?udo de por si, pero no a mi maximo explendor, o que pasa es que de ni?o y adolescente use lentes muy gruesos, y eso provoco que mis pesta?as no crecieran como debia de ser.      Lo que me molesta es que tengo un ′primo que nacio igual de pesta?as largas, pero un poco mas cortas que las mias, pero como no uso lentes se le han desarrollado muy bien y me revasa, y pues no me molesta eso tanto, sino que cada vez que me chuleo mis pesta?as en el espejo el sale a decir que las tiene mas larga y que nunca le llegare.      Y pues creeo que una 1 o 3 veces que me moleste que bien, pero siempre ya esta canijo.      ?Me podrian dar un tip que no use rimel?
