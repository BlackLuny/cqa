Cat's are nocturnal by nature.|`|AA12260782	Are you asking if cats climb buildings at night?  They roam around and get on roofs if there is access from the ground, some cat's can jump to the roof of a 1 story building, but they can't climb the walls.<br>  They climb trees or use other things as ladders, like trash cans or fences, to get on the roof.<br>  I hope that answers your question.|`|AA10656151	sure, they have excellent vision at night|`|AA12073561	Not sure about the question, but if it's CAN cats climb buildings at night -- yep!   And at any other time, too, if the building has a climbable exterior.
AA12073561	Really the only thing you CAN do is shoo the cat away when she's out there -- but do not hurt her!!!    It's possible that the kitty wants to make friends with the dog -- and the dog whines and looks sad when you take her away from the door, so maybe she likes having the kitty there.   She's in the house all day, so that's excitement for the day.  Just train the dog not to BARK when the kitty is there.|`|996e8f6f18a9ab2956efedff558829b2aa	Post posters if somebody lost a cat.

7d998382f159650aaae759e9badd857daa	I read in an about cats book that their stomach is a sensitive  area, and also when they are on their back they feel the most vulnerable.

The bitey/kicking behavior seems to be from overstimulation.  Mine do this too on occasion.  They LOVE their tummies rubbed, but sometimes do bite and kick, even though they're "presenting" the tummies for pets.  I believe it's either overstimulation or a moody cat who re-thinks whether or not he/she is in the mood for a belly rub.  It's normal.   You just have to learn to read the cat and use your reflexes accordingly!  =)|`|c43998024b73131ee78ba9f434db6acdaa	Every creature has their own personality human and animal alike.

In the wild, some mother cats will do this because without their whiskers the kittens can't be independent, they are defenseless so it forces them to stay close to the other cat.

AA12073561	Sounds like your little kitty wants to at least be an indoor/outdoor kitty.

3d50fe6001d7054bd8e70e7f26c87fb7aa	I wouldn't rush to ride just yet.  As well as the visible part there is also bruising which you won't see.  Get some Iodine and put it on all of the wounds and keep them clean in a few days start with lunging him or walking him with a lead rope around the pasture see if he is limping or acting different than normal.  Remember that when a saddle and rider are on there will also be more weight.  Personally I would wait at least a week before I put the saddle on and rode to give the bruising and cuts time to heal.  Also I know you don't want to take sympathy for it but check your sisters horse as well often when one kicks the other kicks back.  Don't confine the horse to the stall and make sure you get him out for some excercise and if any signs of infection start get a vet out there fast or you could end up with a lame horse.|`|1c39bf77ac87396c5071c1fbe5253f31aa	If there are wounds down to the bone you need to consult a vet. A topical antibiotic spray is probably not sufficient. Even if they do not require stitches, horses are prone to infection, particularly in leg wounds. Most equine vets will travel to your place instead of you having to trailer your horse to them. Wounds that are as deep as you say they are need to heal from the inside out. If they close over too soon, infection can set in and even affect the bone. I would not ride a horse with wounds this deep for awhile. Your horse needs to rest and heal.|`|575299d91a04862c942f666a99faaf4faa	Take it to the vet before you ride him.|`|AA12051640	I would have a vet come and get stitches for such open wounds.

They are a bad team together.|`|bbf320869380ad5fd2daaf8b28754ad2aa	I really wouldn't ride him for a couple of days.  It would be like having a sprained muscle and someone wanting you to play tennis.  Let him rest and make sure that there wasn't any serious damage done.  If it does get worse a lot of large animal vets will make house calls.|`|AA10265913	Hey 3d do the responsible thing and have a vet check your horse out.|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	You can further cause injury and soreness to the horse.<br>  <br>  Let your horse heal before you get back on him.<br>  <br>  If he hasn't been checked by vet. I would strongly recommend it. Because no bleeding doesn't mean no bleeding internally. Which a horse at the ranch down the street just had a horse die due to internal bleeding.<br>  <br>  I doubt you would want to walk nor have someone on your back if you got kicked or injured. <br>  <br>  Give your horse that same respect.<br>  <br>  For further reference, best to supervise or separate your horse's horse from yours to prevent such situations.<br>  <br>  Because you don't want to take your kids to the hospital does not grant you don't.  If your horse needs medical need, then give it. Especially since you don't have the technology to know if it went to "the bone" and you even more so show you have no clue what you know since you "exaggerate" and think it is "ok" to ask strangers if you should ride your injured horse. uh, It is common sense darlin.<br>  <br>  That is good you are trying to treat it yourself. But an injury that shows pain needs to be exam to make sure no internal damage has been done. This horse will need some healing time. You won't know exactly how much time he needs with out proper diagnose.<br>  <br>  You don't need a trailer to have a vet come out. It is called a Ranch Call.|`|6e765923cfe63ff1ec32ffbd0974d51daa	Just see how he does with walking around or lunging. if he is limping or not really stretching out his legs then don't ride him.

That is the # 1 reason male dogs pee everywhere.  If ne is then it is really a matter of potty training.  Female dogs pee on floors etc.  Males of course you know this lift their legs.. most of the time.  You need to start with a crate to train a small dog.  You can get these at any pets mart or pet store.  Keep him in it only when you aren't by his side so try to keep him with you as much as possible.  Even keeping him on a leash with you by your side is great.  Take him outside frequently and keep his water and food time minimal while potty training.  But make sure he gets what he needs just not too much.  Take him to the same spot every time and say the same words like go potty.  Give him tons of praise for going even the slightest bit.  If he has any accidents don't get mad at him just take him out immediately if you miss it you can't get after him he won't understand.  He may stop with in a couple of days to weeks.  My cocker Spaniel had a hard time, I didn't like the crate as much cause I felt bad for her.  So I just kept her on a leash and if I had to go somewhere then I did the crate.  I hope this might give you a little help.  I have worked with dogs for a while and this helped small dogs that have smaller bladders.<br>  If you have any more questions feel free to ask..|`|88c78e6a86983ceddca3a99970adec43aa	Yeah, I have a Pomeranian who really gets off on spraying aerosol cans too; room freshener, deodorant, hairspray, you name it; he’d go around the house spraying everything till the cans were empty. So, one day I fixed him and put the aerosols in the garbage and bought only pump- sprays. The dogs still trying to figure out how they work but he hasn’t quite done it yet. Hope this helps and good luck!|`|AA11080761	You can never get the male to stop spraying anything. No matter how much you rub his nose in it or punish him for it, it will not stop. And yes, he will do it in the house. We had a breeding male Westie in our house for 15 years and he sprayed ANYTHING that had the scent of a female dog on it. On top of that, the "spray" of a male dog is oil-based. That is why it keeps its scent for so long. So no matter what you clean the sprayed objects with, the smell will not go away. You can get him fixed, however, he will continue to "spray" with urine instead. Seriously, I suggest that you start out with your own dog. That way, if you get a male Pom, you can fix him young and you will not have that problem. I don't understand why your friend is getting rid of him just because she wants a new dog.....is she scared it won't get along with other dogs?? That would be a different issue should you decide to get another dog.<br>  <br>  FOR CLARIFICATION: The spray is not pee. It is a different bodily fluid altogether than urine.|`|af837d5ab7ab0e6bdb5362723aa471d5aa	it might depend on if you have any dogs have two males right now that mark there territory on everything....ive got four females that  dont help but if you have never had one he might not do it ...some of them just love to hike that leg belive i know....maybe tray getting him neutered if he is not all ready sometimes that solves the problem good luck|`|2faf1abeedb4a31fd1807b563435bd50aa	have him fixed thern he wont   all hes doing his marking is truf

If its a small office the puppies with parvo are in the hospital side with cats to keep it from spreading to dogs.  If there is a large vet clinic they will have a separate room for Parvo and usually they let the donor cats run loose in there.  <br>  <br>  Cats are susceptible to far worse diseases than parvo.  Parvo is just a virus that has to run its course Feline aids and leukemia is highly contagious and incurable. FIP there is not only no cure but no accurate test except an autopsy.

Our domestic cows are bred for milk production.  They are very needy of us.  They wouldn't last in the wild.  (I am guessing.)  They can not handle heat well, so hot climates will get them.  They produce way more milk than they need for offspring, so mastitis and mammary system problems would get most of them within a short time frame.<br>  <br>  There are wild buffalo though.  These are probably close to what the domestic cow came from originally.  Notice when you look at them they don't have gigantic udders.

There are MILLIONS of animals put to death each year because no one wants them!

Mating a mother and son is not a good idea because negative genetic traits could become apparent.  There are many kiittens out there that have no home.  They are euthanized in shelters daily.  Some are left to their own devices on the streets, where they will get sick, get run over by cars and get mauled by dogs.  Any of these cats would love a good home.

sHTpXUScaa	Honestly,  gender does matter to some dogs. I have two male dogs who live together right now  and they are doing fine because they know who is the pack leader. A female dog and a male dog tend to work out better than two males or two females. <br>  <br>    I highly recommended not to get two same sex. It depends on your background and experience with raising dogs. I have consulted a family who owns two female dogs who fight fiercely! They couldn't be in the same room because they both were battling for leadership which could result in a death. <br>  <br>   If your leadership is very firm and clear to the same gender dogs, they will give your respect not to fight. Only a leader decides who will fight and who is not allowed to. If  both are fighting, then they simple don't view you as their pack leader. The odds that they are fighting for leader position since both want the same position. It is better to have a human being be in charge of everything and tell them what to do or how to live with.|`|5Gr1TpMKaa	It really depends on your dog.Some dogs don't really care what gender they are.My doxies(which are both girls) don't give a crap honestly.They get along with any dog.But my maltese do care, the girl hates both of my doxies cause they are girls also.The guy maltese just hates anyone except for the other girl maltese.Two male dogs will get along for the most part in my experience.Once in a while they'll fight a little too rough.It honestly depends on the dogs personality, in my opinion and experience with the thousands of dogs I've had.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi you're best bet would be female and a male.

aCqSF87Raa	I personally do not like them as very determined dogs CAN and WILL run the boundary to get what they want (wether that be another animal, a person, what have you.) They also don't keep people or dogs OUT of your yard.<br>  <br>  Their overall success depends on the dog and your location. If you live in a high traffic area where there are lots of people or other dogs, if your dog is stubborn in any way, if it is aggressive, or if it has thick fur... then you run high risk of the dog not taking to training - then you risk hit-by-car accidents OR bite incidents. If your dog is skittish or generally fearful you run the risk of the dog not accepting the shock as a correction and the dog WILL become fearful of the yard.<br>  <br>  The training is there for a reason. You cannot just throw your dog out in the yard. I would personally NEVER trust any dog out alone on one of these systems just because you never know.<br>  <br>  PS - It's a good idea to not let the boundary extend ANYWHERE near the road. It's also a good idea to have signs posted to alert people that there IS a fence. <br>  <br>  In my aunt's neighborhood there are two homes with two dogs per home on this system - both sets of dogs can reach the road (and if they reach out can bite a passerby should they want to) and you cannot tell that they won't be able to reach you.<br>  <br>  Because of this their dog developed fear aggression (recent trainer diagnosed it.) He and my aunt/uncle merely reacted to two dogs charging them and now he's dog reactive in certain situations.<br>  <br>  Posting a sign or area of the boundaries isn't REQUIRED but for the sake of your neighbors should be done.|`|j8y0tWrdaa	The invisible fence guy "showed up" twice, of course I couldn't see him because he's invisible but he billed me and supposedly trained Trixie.

It could be a gastroenteritis, worms or it could be something to do with the liver or kidneys.  You need to take him to a vet and have them draw some blood, possible x-rays of the stomach.  Some dogs chew on things they shouldn't and get very sick to their stomach as they get an obstruction from what they ate.  Also another thing to think about is did someone poison him?  A favorite poison mean people use is antifreeze cause it's cheap and they can hide it in food.  Dogs will have severe vomiting and diarrhea with that.   You should really take the dog to the vet and have him checked.  A person can give him some Pepto-Bismol it coats the stomach but if it was poison i'm not sure the vet would want that one the stomach or not a person usually gives 1 tsp.  Maybe your vets won't come out at night where i live which is pretty isolated they actually will open up and you can go in any time of night.

AA10250843	Boxers do have more than their fair share of heart problems, but if the vet suspects anything is wrong they will do some pre-surgical testing. Make sure your vet uses safer reversible-type anesthesias (most do). I worked for vets for many years & we never lost a pet from a routine immature spay or neuter.<br>  <br>  p.s to Jackfm:  Beauty is the eye of the beholder, & my AKC champion Boxer is one handsome dog - people stop me when walking him to admire him all the time!|`|AA11709234	Actually, I have been a vet tech for 17 years and NEVER heard of that, or had a vet say that, or ever seen a problem with Boxers and anesthesia.

And she had a hard time finding a vet that would fix her boxer. I can remember it was something about the breathing but thats it.  I would check into the vets experience before doing anything.

c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	My two shih tzus don't really need or want a lot of exercise, so that part is good for you. Mine are also relatively quiet dogs that don't bark much, but that may just be mine. They require quite a bit of grooming and both of mine mat pretty easily if I don't brush them every day. They're very loyal and like to follow me around the house. Mine also like to chase my cats, although they've never hurt my cats. One of the bad things is that they tend to be pretty difficult to house-train, even if they're already an adult. So be prepared to spend a lot of time taking him out frequently until he gets it.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Yes, they are on the average super companions.  They are comical, smart, loving, playful dogs.  I have never met a Shih Tzu I didn't like.  They don't require a lot of exercise just a lot of professional grooming.<br>  They are often classified as a 'toy' breed but are not suppose to be less than 9 pounds or more than about 16 pounds.  They have sturdy little compact bodies and have a big dog attitude.<br>  <br>  If this Shih Tzu is true to his breed, you will love this dog.
75ca8efd90a321d3477db0e13295c4a7aa	Okay, first problem. Your dog is most likely going in the bathroom because he smells his scent there. When your puppy is only a puppy and has come into a new environment they are still confused and trying to adjust. If they had an accident in the bathroom they can still smell their scent 5 weeks later. They will continually go in the same spot time after time after time. You may have cleaned up the mess already and used whatever smell freshner there is but the puppy's nose probably still picks it up. <br>  <br>  The best way to train him not to go in your bathroom is to look after him. Watch where he walks to, where he sniffs. Don't let him to into your bathroom until you're sure he can go outside. When you take him out of his crate and he still does not go outside, just leave him outside. Eventually he'll really really need to go and will just let it out. Once he's start doing it the rest will catch on pretty fast.<br>  <br>  Dog on the bed is annoying. Many people say spanking a dog is not right. But trust me, if things such as giving him a treat, praises or whatever does not work, a smart spanking will do the job. Don't get me wrong. Don't spank your puppy so hard it'll hurt 2 hours later. Heck, don't even spank your puppy hard enough that it'll hurt 10 minutes later. A firm spank on the bottom will get the message across. A firm spank with a firm "don't-you-dare-argue-with-me" tone of voice will do the trick. Your puppy needs to know who's in boss. And the one who's in boss gives out commands that must be obeyed. Maybe it sounds a little harsh especially when your puppy gives you the puppy eyes but if nothing works, that's the way to go about it.|`|0454f0e0ef3bc32911798845de942481aa	OMG - That is ALMOST too funny...We have a beagle...and LET ME TELL YOU....<br>  The LASTthing they are is stupid.....stubborn, yes, bullheaded, yes, hard to train...yes<br>  The only thing that works with beagles is PATIENCE, PATIENCE and MORE PATIENCE.<br>  So...as far as toilet training....If you have crate trained him and he STILL won't go outside, you are probably not giving him enough time...Take him out an give him the command to go pee or pooh...(repeat)(repeat)repeat)...You may have to wait a long time but when he finally does go...PRAISE HIM AND TREAT HIM!!!  There is actually a commercial product available called a "pee post" which is loaded with pheremones that are supposed to attract a dog to go there. Try it. Can't hurt. I have not tried it with mine but they are all housebroken (I have 4 dogs).<br>  Keeping him off the bed???   LOL   Good luck....ours sleeps with us but we let her. If he is crate trained...keep the bedroom door closed when you are not there and crate him at night in the room with you.<br>  Good luck!|`|062c00cddd31a5947d760d7429dc37aeaa	Well, your first problem is the breed.  Not that I don't like beagles.. but they are one of the hardest breeds to HOUSE BREAK".  They are smart dogs, not House pets.  Also, another problem could be that if he has used the bathroom in one spot, they will smell the amonia and continue to go to the same spot, unless you put something there to remove the smell. Like vingar. That wont stain your carpets or bed, and should remove any odor. Hope this helps...|`|24f9a535ecc1ed76d22641100464fb3aaa	He will only pee inside because he is claiming your house and....your bed! If u dont already take him for walks, make sure he is calm the hole time and stays beside or behind you! that shows you are the leader(boss). when he is on your bed, snap and point off the bed and if he doesnt listen, then give him a firm  touch or nudge! Do this repeatedly and it should work!<br>  good luck!<br>  watch ''Dog Whisperer'' on channel 63 (national geographic)|`|2c40a089a7863700951914bfab2b714baa	FIRST OF ALL, DON'T SPANK YOUR DOG!!!!!! Also, another thing, HE'S ONLY 14 WEEKS OLD! They don't have full control of their bladder yet! My dog didn't get fully housebroken until 7 months old! You have to be repetitive, just put the dog off the bed and say no, and do this every single time you see him on the bed! He'll get this soon, in maybe a month of so! It's the point of being a dog owner, patience!!!!!! Pick him up, take him outside every hour or so, and make sure he goes pee! Give him a treat for peeing outside!<br>  <br>   Don't punish your dog for peeing inside! Just clean the spot and say NO! That's it! My dog is 2 years old and he still doesn't go outside to potty by himself... We still have to walk outside with him to go potty, but my dog knows he's supposed to pee outside. He'll go outside if it's an emergency though.... HE'S ONLY A PUPPY! <br>  <br>  Why would you think your own puppy is stupid? He's just learning! How would you feel if some alien took care of you, and everytime you decided to sit on their couch, they spanked you and scolded you in some unknown language? Would you understand a word they said in only 1 month? No.... You would understand after a few months or so!! <br>  <br>  Just give the dang puppy some time!!!!!! He'll learn, he's only SO young! Just be patient and persistent. When you take him outside to go potty, MAKE SURE HE HAS TO GO POTTY! Even if it takes half an hour to wait outside in the freezing cold weather! <br>  <br>  Well.. anyways, good luck to you :)|`|42c87e3847b3bbea18e8c46fb98e123baa	well, what i would do if hes not responding to your commands, is i would go and ask my vet about it, or if your really into and love your dog, go and research online or go to the library. also, you can try to rearange your stuff and then like maybe hell go where the bed was. well, i cant help youi much, but i tried.

When you take him out don't come back in til he has gone and then praise him a lot. Our beagle is 5 months old. she wouldn't stay of the bed either, she wanted to be close. There is a simple solution and its not hitting him. Close the door. He might cry for a couple of nights. Does he have his own pillow. Try putting the shirt you wore for the day on it, that way he's close to your scent. Beagles need lot of room to run.  Beagles are alot of work but you couldn't ask for a better dog. Good luck|`|5915dcf59ff6c020280481f6170bfed3aa	Have you tried getting him a bed of his own?  Both my dogs have the same problem but if they have their own bed they love it!  Try using a stand at the end of your bed with a comfy cusion on it.  He'll feel like he's sleeping on the bed!  Get him accusomded to some favorite stuffed toys.  At the end of the night place them on his new bed and see how it goes!|`|65d1f450b20e8268f41934ca1d9a326aaa	How can u call a dog stupid when it loves u so much<br>  have u realiesed it won't go out of the house without u or anyone he knows? he's a puupy mind you, he's curious but he will have insecurities, i hae a puppy beagle, he's adventurous and he would not stop easily. when he grows older and more familiar with the surroundings he will be okay, as for sleeping one the bed, he wants to be close to you, many pet lovers love that, and if u do not why did u get a pet in the first place, remind urself of why u get a pet, sometimes, animals follow instincts and not brains because they love they are more simple-minded|`|9e97e01988c7d70c7350228dde386d75aa	have you tried puppy training pads? and make sure when he does potty outside you make him feel like he has done a back flip, lots and lots of praise.

You just need to be very firm, and let him understand that you won't give up either. Every time he comes up, push him back down. If he still doesn't give up by the end of two to three weeks, you need to lock him into his own doggy pen, or wherever he is supposed to sleep. <br>  <br>  If you can't potty train your dog you need to get  a professional trainer. I know it seems as though such an easy thing can be done by yourself, but a professional will know how to do it right.|`|aa7925964a8d49ab0be321cad8a35d78aa	No, you are the pot calling the kettle black. Dogs aren't stupid. They are pack animals and you are part of the pack, or the dog thinks so and if you don't want to be that then why did you get a dog? If you want the dog to go outside you have to spend more time outside, until the dog goes to the bathroom. He has learned allready to go inside so you are teaching the opposite now. So, take outside early in the morning, After 10 min. If it hasn't gone take it back in and out it back in the crate. Wait another 15 min. and take outside again...do this until it goes. Also, the next time it goes inside take it outside with a paper towel that you cleaned with and put that on the ground. do not yell or scold. Then the first time the dog goes, praise and reward, make a really big deal about it. Then if you don't want the dog on the bed make it a really nice bed near yours or inside the crate. I have mine sleeping with me, warm and cuddly and my true companion. But, I know everyone doesn't want that. So, you need to keep your door closed or put the dog in the crate when you are on your bed. That way you won't be bothered. After the dog eats, plays or drinks it will need to go out all day long. It takes a while for the bladder to get big enough and they get to the point of being able to hold their bladder. You  had to be trained too!!! You didn't come ready made and perfect. So, anytime the dog is sniffing and looking around you might want to take a trip outside. It will learn but it is still very young and it takes a lot of time and commitment. Maybe you aren't ready for a dog. Good luck to the dog. And you. Just find it a good home if you aren't willing. Please.

If the vet is worth their degree, then they will try their best to rid your dog of their problem.  <br>  <br>  But if you want to take care of it yourself, the start with food.  If you are feeding the dog say a store brand of food then try Science Diet.  This is a bit more expensive but it might work.  <br>  <br>  If you think that it might be soap related, then stop using it.  It appears that you might have been using medicated soaps, but if not, then you might want to get a medicated shampoo for your dog.  (Do not use shampoos that are used on humans as it will dry the dog's skin out.)<br>  <br>  Some dogs are even allergic to flea bites, as well as being allergic to the treatment for the fleas.   <br>  <br>  Check the web page that is listed.

376dd6352c21968d41a7af68849b2414aa	I'm sure that you wouldn't even have to wash the gravel every other week with three biofilters on it. I've been keeping three orandas in my fifty-five gallon tank with a single power filter on it for several years now, and I get by with changing the water once a month or so! Granted, I don't test for ammonia, nitrate levels and stuff like that, but the water doesn't get cloudy until about a month. That's when I wash the gravel, only to find that there's barely any sediments. Your water changes every week are good for your fish, but you can wash the gravel less. (It helps keep the beneficial bacteria on it too!)|`|5c7064ba07ff6e5c7187c56dea8b2e18aa	sounds fine to me as long as fish are healthy. you could probably get by with every other week & clean mine with your spare time|`|d84b03804cab833afdfbb991099703b0aa	that sounds fine|`|16668b9d558f1fe179a12d76976df8c6aa	I only clean the gravel in my tank once a month and do weekly 25% water changes.

N70orPJ6aa	Hi, sorry for the late answer.<br>  <br>  1.) The humidity in the tank at ALL times should be low. Too much humidity for Bearded Dragons can cause respiratory problems as well as skin problems. <br>  <br>  2.) If it's pooping, it's fine. What the poop looks like is what matters. Runny diarrhea like poop that smells horrible is not normal and probably caused by parasites or poor diet.<br>  <br>  3.) Don't spay the tank or the tank decor at all. Like I said in my answer to question 1, too much humidity is bad for them. Instead of misting and spraying the tank, give your beardie a bath 1-2 times a week (more if shedding). <br>  <br>  4.) Of course it's normal for any reptile to want to hide. It probably feels safer under the newspaper. Are you providing enough hiding spots? If you don't want her hiding all the time, switch the substrate to slate textured (unglazed) tiles. She won't be able to get under those, plus they make for easier maintenance.<br>  <br>  5.) If she has a hard time finding her crickets, block off a part of the enclosure and feed her there. If that still doesn't work, get a smaller tank for feeding purposes. A small 20 gallon tank would be fine just to feed her in. <br>  <br>  Just a few extra suggestions:<br>  <br>  Make sure you are using a high quality UVB florescent TUBE light. A repti-sun 10.0 high output UVB tube is the best available. <br>  <br>  Basking temps should go up to 100-105F, with the rest of the tank staying around 80-85F. <br>  <br>  Use a varied diet for the highest nutrition for your beardie. Feed foods like crickets, wax worms, silk worms, phoenix worms, etc. Veggies and fruits are also a must and you can use things like Collared, Mustard, and Dandelion Greens, Kale, Escarole, Strawberries, Peaches, any orange fleshed squash, and others. <br>  <br>  Along with the insects that you feed, make sure you are dusting them with a high quality calcium and vitamin supplement. The best available is Rep-Cal Calcium and Rep-Cal Herptivite. <br>  <br>  If you need anything else, please feel free to email me.
tWzIsIH0aa	Regular name-brand cat food is OK, but make sure to put down fresh, cold water. Pregnant cats drink tons of water. They also like to hide behind couches or some darkly lit area to give birth, so make sure you have a spot or two ready for her with some towels. Make sure the area is clean of wires and such. Some cats vocalize, i.e. cry out and get extremely affectionate.<br>  <br>  Hopefully I helped you, and hope your cat delivers her kittens healthy.|`|sayfQB2aaa	Good luck! theres a lot to do I'm going to edit this question later.|`|jxizzHL1aa	FALCOOON PAAAAAWNCH!!!!|`|UVzmI5H3aa	LUCKY!

02b8c567a5af62959d05cd811ac28cc9aa	All of the above.<br>  <br>  It is most probably a bacterial infection caused by poor water quality and made worse by the stress of cramped quarters and toxic water. Goldfish kept in bowls can only be kept alive by constant water changes. In order to live long, healthy lives, they need large tanks with room to grow and swim as well as heavy filtration to keep their water clean. No fish should have to live without filtration but goldfish especially produce a lot of ammonia. Ammonia burns the gills, damages the internal organs, and will absolutely kill your fish given a few more days.<br>  <br>  To help your fish the most immediately, start by changing out half of his water with clean, dechlorinated water that you've allowed to sit and become room temperature. You'll have to do this DAILY. Buy some medication for the bacterial infection, too. I don't know if your fish will make it, but this will give him a fighting chance.<br>  <br>  Most importantly for your fish's long term benefit, buy a larger tank. For one black moor, you'll need a 20 gallon tank at least. I know that seems big but if you keep your black moor alive it can grow to be up to a foot long! It's better if you buy pieces separately at a petstore or fish store, rather than buy a kit, so that you can choose what to get. Your goldfish won't need a heater since it's a coldwater fish, but be sure to get a good filter that can handle up to 50 gallons or so. If money is tight, gravel and plants are expensive and not necessary to start out with. There are also fish foods specifically made for goldfish rather than tropicals.<br>  <br>  When you transfer your blackmoor, you will need to either:<br>  1) Buy a packet of BioSpira and put it into the tank at the same time as your fish. It's the only product that actually works to instantly cycle your tank. Or<br>  2) Test your water daily for ammonia and nitrate levels. Change 20% of your water any time you have an ammonia reading above 0 or a nitrate reading above 40ppm.<br>  <br>  For future reference, so you don't have to go through this again, new tanks need to be cycled before you add fish. Just letting the tank sit for x amount of days or even weeks doesn't do a thing. You have to feed the bacteria to grow a colony in there capable of supporting a fish population.

Just keep him hydrated. <br>  <br>  You can also call your vet and tell him what the ingredients are, just to be sure. The vet will let you know if anything in the laxative is harmful.

06038d4ad0797848c4370c82ca01ad04aa	If you are just learning, I wouldn't worry about getting a "Barrel Racing Saddle"  I ran for two years in a slick seat barrel saddle before I could afford my fancy barrel saddle.  Its not the utmost necessity, especially if you're not going that fast and learning.  It is necessary that the saddle fits you and the horse well, and you're comfortable staying in it, even around fast turns.<br>  <br>  You'll need a bridle and some form of a single peice rein.  Don't  use split reins, its just a bad plan.  You can get barrel reins with knots, which are handy for turning, but if you have a roping rein laying around, it'l;l work just fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  A bit should be a broken mouthpeice, never a solid curb bit.  Depending on the controllability of your horse, you can choose the severity of the bit.  Length of shanks, mouthpeice, etc.<br>  <br>  A good saddle pad.  Not necessarily any of those fancy SHOCK ABSORBING pads...a lot of these are just hype.  If your saddle fits, it fits, no pad is going to force it to fit.<br>  <br>  I recommend getting boots for your horse.  This will protect their legs and support them in turns.  You can get lower quality ones, and even use polo wraps for learning.<br>  <br>  A tie down may be necessary if your horse starts to lift his/her head too high and take the bit and run.  If you need a tie down, you also need a breastcollar.  Having a tie down hang without a breastcollar to keep it controlled is scary and dangerous.<br>  <br>  Also, a good clean girth that your horse can move in.  Neoprene girths are good and help with grip if your saddle is a little loose.  Don't use string girths, they can cause more irritation than they are worth.|`|5a30f8733a0687ace9f8df939f7feac2aa	my mom was a world champ, so i know a lot. well first you need a horse, duh, saddle, bridal,reins barrels and good training.Just go to a local arena or if you have one set up three barrels in a triangular position and practice going around them in a certain way( go online or get a book that shows the other positions and the way to go around them).Then after a while start timing yourself! there are a whole bunch of different positions(or courses) of the barrels but that is how you get started.|`|0dce3040f633ed577bc5837dc66d6611aa	the equipment you'll need will vary based on your horse. The basics though are a western barrel racing saddle (yes there is a difference than say a pleasure saddle), a breast collar, boots to protect your horses legs, and a bridle. Whether you use a bit or a hackamore will depend on your horse, and some horses also use a tie down. Good luck!
AA11302956	The key is to set them up for success. If you go hardcore, you can train them in about 2 weeks. Get a crate. The puppy should sleep in the crate at night. Start your morning first thing by carrying the pup (or putting them on a leash and walking very quickly to the door) outside to where you want them to potty. don't give any attention, don't talk to the pup, just let him do his thing. If he potties, then you can go inside and feed him, if he doesn't then back into the crate he goes and you can try again in about 15 minutes. Puppies are stimulated to pee after eating, drinking, or playing, so any time you see him doing any of these things, take him out 15 minutes later. Try to keep your pup on a leash in the house. They can sneak away so quickly! Put the leash around your ankle if you need your hands free. Remember, your puppy has no idea what's going on at first. Spanking and yelling at him will ruin your bond. If he potties in the house, it's your responsibility. Expect a few accidents and dont get frustrated when they happen. That crate is the best thing in the world while you train. If he doesn't potty when you take him out, put him in the crate until you take him out and he goes. JNo food or water after 8PM or 3 hours before the pup's bedtime. Good luck!!|`|4d21d8005d4aaa77963a9b62716f93c4aa	when he or she uses the bathroom in the house put his or her nose in spank him or her then make him or her scrach at the door|`|b1ae06a1fe2d43f0d327dad7eaab1ab0aa	It can be really hard, but the best way is just keep taking her outside a lot. When she pees in the house just tell her no but do not yell at her. My vet told me to rub a paper towel in the accident and then put it outside and let her sniff it.  That way she gets the idea thats where to go. Another thing is some puppies take longer for them to get control of the bladders so be patient.Make sure you praise her alot. Dogs wantt to please you so reward her for a good job. Good luck, mines 5 months and she only has an accident once in a while now.|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	How long it will take you to house train your dog depends on your dedication to the training process and your puppy's maturity and learning rate. <br>  <br>  Things you will need to housetrain your puppy are a properly fitted crate, a collar and leash, some treats, and time and patience. <br>  <br>  You also need to pick a spot for your puppy to go potty. Using the same spot each time will help the puppy recognize that this is where he should go, and the smell from going there other times will help him go potty faster when you take him out. <br>  <br>  I don't recommend using doggie litter boxes or those puppy pads. If you want your dog to always go potty in the house fine, then use this article to teach them to go there. But don't complain to me when your dog starts going other places in the house. Dogs often times cannot tell the difference between a puppy pad and your expensive rug. All they know is its ok to go potty in the house so any area with a roof is fair game for elimination. Also trying to paper train a dog and then trying to switch the dog to going outside is counterproductive and confusing for the dog. Doing this will only slow the training down. So forget the puppy pads and start teaching your dog to go outside from day one. If you have already been using them throw them out and start all over from the beginning, but keep mind the process may take a little longer the second time around since once your dog has bad habits they are hard to break. Its much easier to prevent them than to correct them later. <br>  <br>  When looking for a crate you want one that is big enough for your dog to stand up, turn around and lay down. You don't want it so big that he can lay in one end and use the other end as a bathroom. If he can do this trust me he will. There are all kinds of different styles of crates: the two most common are wire and plastic. But they come in mesh, wicker, all sorts of different materials now. I would recommend choosing either a wire or plastic one, especially for puppies that like to chew. Here are some pros and cons of plastic and wire crates. <br>  <br>  Plastic: These come in several sizes so can accommodate nearly every size of dog. They also give a more den like feeling to the dog and have less of a cage look. The disadvantage to these crates is that you may need to buy more than one to accommodate a growing puppy, and they take up more room if you want to store them even though they usually will come apart in halves for storage. There are also some newer plastic crates that will fold up similar to a wire crate. <br>  <br>  Wire: Like the plastic crate these also come in a variety of sizes. They do look more like cages though, something that can be fixed by purchasing a cover for it. A cover will also help some dogs feel more secure in a wire crate. The advantage of these is that you can buy a size to fit your dog when it is full grown. Wire crates have dividers available for purchase so that you can make the crate fit your puppy. These also have a storage advantage in that most fold up very neatly and can be stored easily. <br>  <br>  Next you will need to introduce your puppy to its crate. Just sticking the puppy in there without a positive introduction can be very stressful for the pup. I like to bring a new puppy home on a day off, and try to pick it up as soon as possible in the morning. This way I have all day to introduce the puppy to the crate so that by bedtime the puppy will feel pretty comfortable with its crate and shouldn't fuss to much. <br>  <br>  Start by showing the puppy the crate and let him explore it. Next show your puppy a treat and then toss it inside. When your puppy goes in to get the treat praise him excitedly. Repeat this a few times and then end this session. If your pup won't go all the way in the crate to get the treat try throwing it closer to the door, or even outside the door and then gradually toss it farther back, until the pup goes all the way in. <br>  <br>  After an hour or two have another session with crate. If your pup went all the way in the last time start there, if not start at the point you left off. After a couple times of going in the crate and coming right back out you can shut the door. But let the pup out after a second or two. Repeat this gradually increasing the amount of time the pup is in the crate. If you do this several times the first day by the time your ready for bed your pup should be pretty comfortable with the crate. I also like to repeat this process for a day or two after the pup comes home. <br>  <br>  Also remember that whenever your dog is crated you need to remove any type of collar, even a buckle collar can catch on a crate and strangle a dog. <br>  <br>  Now that you have your crate set up and your pup introduced to it you need to put your puppy on a feeding schedule. Puppies 8 wks to 6 months should be given three meals a day. After six months this can be cut down to 2 meals. Free-feeding (having food available all the time) is not recommended. It can lead to obesity and makes it harder to housetrain your puppy. Another disadvantage to this feeding method is that it will be harder for you tell if your dog is off food which can be a sign of illness. Feeding on a schedule allows you to predict when your puppy will need to go out. If you know when it went in you can predict when it will come out. You will want to divide your dog's full daily amount into three smaller meals. Give him the food and after twenty minutes take away the bowl whether there is food in it or not. Dogs will generally consume all they want in twenty minutes. Take your puppy to his potty spot about 15-20 minutes after he has finished eating. Repeat the go potty command while you are waiting for him to go. When he starts to go tell him good boy go potty, and when he has finished give him a treat and make a big fuss over him. <br>  <br>  I'd also like to tell you how to tell if your puppy is getting to much or to little food. The recommendations on dog food bags are just a starting point. Start with that amount and then watch to see if your dog needs more or less. The way to tell is to do a rib check. You shouldn't be able to see the ribs, if you can add more food. You should be able to easily feel the ribs under a thin layer of fat, if you have trouble feeling the ribs, cut back the amount of food. <br>  <br>  In addition to having to go out after meals your puppy will also need to go potty after he wakes up from a nap, after playing, and first thing in the morning and before bed. Signs that your puppy needs to go out: are restlessness and circling an area while sniffing. If your puppy does these things it's a safe bet to take him out. Remember though that individual dogs have their own signs of needing to go to the bathroom and you will soon pick up on these signals as well. <br>  <br>  When you are out for potty breaks you should stand still, if he wants to play ignore him. You want him to know that it is time to go to the bathroom not time to play. If you allow him to play before he goes to the bathroom he may start to hold out on you to extend his playtime. Once he has gone to the bathroom however you can play all you want. Stay outside with your dog for about 10 minutes to wait for him to go, if he doesn't go in ten minutes just pick him up and carry him back inside matter-of-factly. No treats or playtime on the way in. When you get back into the house he will either need to be crated or watched like a hawk. Try again in ten minutes. Repeat until he goes. <br>  <br>  Another mistake a lot of people make when they bring their new puppy home is to allow him free run of the place. This will only hurt your training and will also cause your dog to get into a lot of trouble. Young puppies need to be watched. When your puppy can't be watched he should be in his crate. This way he can't make a mistake or get into trouble. <br>  <br>  Accidents: <br>  <br>  The only time you can punish your puppy for having an accident in the house is if you catch him in the act. Even then it's less of a punishment and more of a redirection. If you see your puppy going to the bathroom in the house, startle him with a sharp NO and take him outside to finish the job. When he finishes outside, give him a treat and lots of praise. Back inside the house clean up the mess and use an enzymatic cleaner (such as OUT or Nature's Miracle) to remove all traces of the mess so he won't be tempted to use the same spot. Most carpet cleaners will leave traces of the mess that you can't see or smell, but your pet can.<br>  <br>  If you find a mess after the fact, well to bad that one is your fault, you should have been watching the puppy. Simply clean it up and try to watch more carefully. If you try to scold your pup after the fact he will have no idea what you are mad about and will be confused and may even become scared of you. NEVER, NEVER rub your dogs nose in urine or feces. It is not only disgusting but it also has no training value what so ever. Hitting your dog with anything including a rolled up newspaper is also unacceptable. <br>  <br>  Young puppies may need to use the bathroom during the night, so I advise putting the crate in your bedroom. This way if the puppy sounds restless you can take him to the bathroom. This will also make your puppy feel more secure because he is close to you. If you do need to take your puppy out in the middle of the night make sure you allow him to go to the bathroom only. No playtime for these outings. Still give him a treat and praise, but do so in a quieter manner than you would during the day. This way you won't get him all riled up the middle of night. Remember if you let him get away with playing in the middle of the night he will begin to expect it, and you don't want that. How long night time outings will last depends on the age of your puppy, and how fast his bladder matures. <br>  <br>  It also helps to have his last meal of the day at least two hours before bed and take away his water an hour before bed. You don't want to put it in the crate with him, it would be unfair to the puppy to expect him to have a supply of water and then not have to go to the bathroom all night long. The only thing that should be in your dog's crate are a chew toy and maybe a doggie blanket. Although some pups will urinate on absorbant materials that are in their crate, if yours does remove it. Also if you see that your puppy is chewing on his blanket it should be removed. If the puppy ingests part of the blanket it could cause an intestinal blockage. If that happens emergency surgery is needed to remove the blanket from the intestines. <br>  <br>  I know this sounds like a lot of work but that is what puppies are. They are also a lot of fun and that should make up for the work part of having a puppy. And just keep in mind that one day soon you will have a beautiful dog who is housetrained and is a joy to have around. <br>  <br>  (Note: if you are going to use this article to train a dog that had previously been housetrained and is now having accidents, please contact your vet first. If your dog suddenly "forgets" his housetraining it can be a sign of infection, and that needs to be treated. Once you have confirmed that the dog is healthy with your vet, then refresh your dog with this article)|`|dacdf386e9a5b96dbd63017287c770c4aa	If there is a PETCO or a PETSMART nearby, ask if they have these things called Wee wee pads.  They are blue pads with special lining that won't leak.  You'l have to place a new one there after the dog urinate anywehere from 2-3times, depending on how much the urinate.  You can also try taking the dog to the same spot everytime to go to the bath room and say "do your business". These 2 things helped to potty train my new puppy of about 5 months.  he is a year old now.  You have to make sure to reguraly take the dog out on intervals.  So if the dog can hold it for about 3 hours, take the dog out every 2hrs and 45 min.  the dof is bound to have accidents...but these should help correct those.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aa7925964a8d49ab0be321cad8a35d78aa	that age is late to start but they are smart. first you have to cage at night and let out right away in am to go out and do his thing. then let out often, anytime the dog looks around and sniffs it may be looking to go, get it outside. Then when he goes, reward and praise, always...this ia a big part of it. When you aren't home confine to an area that is safe and let him out asap and praise and reward every time he goes. It is a hard job but in the end worth it, takes a real commitment. A lot of people don't realize the first yr. is all about training, teething and having a full time job. then after all that is done, you can relax and enjoy and have a companion for many yrs. Just remember consistency and praise and always let him out often to encourage the outside bathroom, not the inside. Good luck. The crating at night teaches them bladder control, their bladders, like a child has to learn to hold all night, that's why you have to get up no matter how early and take him out in the morning. That is how they learn. Later th cage won't be needed, but it is the easiest way, they won't go where thay sleep unless they have no choice. also, give him chews, and bones. Watch out for beef allergies. A lot of dogs are allergic to beef. Give lamb or chicken. Good luck. Have patience.I  have raised many many dogs, fostered and taken in many more. My take on training on paper in the house is...if that is where you want to have them go it's ok but, that is a bad habit if you want them to go outside. So, the first training should be the only one, not trading one for another.|`|1c795bafcaab4517b1092bc313f16195aa	NEVER STRIKE YOUR DOG! First of all, as soon as you feed your dog put it out side, and watch it. As soon as it takes a dump, praise the dog and bring it back inside. If it takes a dump on the floor scold it and put it back out side. <br>   When your dog is in the house pay attention. it may go to the door but not speak (bark.) Eventualy it will bark to get out. BE PATEINT. It takes time.

enC9TvxUaa	-Ouch!  I am surprised the adoption did not talk to you about this!  With ours, the neighbors cats come to our yard often.  We simply talked to him and showed him the cats were NOT to play with or chase.  He seems to be fine with them now- just ignores them.  You need to make sure the cats are introduced to him at your house!  Also, do not leave him alone with the cats until you are SURE they are going to be okay with each other!  They can get up on thins to escape, but he may then pull down drapes, tables, who knows trying to get to them.  These dopgs are very stubborn!

Then give it time. I got a large puppy with 4 cats and I've pretty much let them get on with it I've not punished the cats for spitting/hissing or even lashing out - they've got to let the dog know what is acceptable I think. As long as the cats can get away you know they're safe. Also, I tell the dog to 'leave' in a firm voice if she is showing too much interest in the cats (then treat and praise if she leaves them), and so far she's been brilliant. The cats have to learn to trust the dog too, so give them time. It's been 5 weeks so far for me, but things get better everyday.|`|AA12392755	Put salt and pepper on them?????
Qas05nZraa	the cat must be brought to a vet|`|BDnSmRE6aa	My cat started to lose fur when she got stressed out by her environment, mainly other cats coming into her territory and also from people giving her too much attention when she wanted to be left alone.

Now that she's more relaxed, it has all grown back.|`|5XsJgcSkaa	Skeeter should probably see the vet.   <br>  <br>  Have you recently changed his food, litter, house carpet, etc?

Seven years is a long time to be around someone for a dog, but this is a good time for you and your dog to bond.  Eventually she won't be able to tell the difference since she still gets to see the kids, but a dog is a lot like a person when it comes to feelings, they do have strong ones when it comes to their family.

Separation anxiety is one of the most common causes of canine behavioural problems.<br>  <br>  There are many problem behaviours associated with separation anxiety including: defecation and urination in inappropriate locations, destructive behaviour, excessive barking and whining, depression, and hyperactivity. These behaviours may also be the symptoms of other problems. However, if undesired behaviours are clearly related to the absence of the owner, occur shortly after departure and a prolonged greeting response occurs upon the owner's return, separation anxiety is the probable cause.<br>  <br>  This site might help you out.

However, I don't believe animals are capable of rational thinking. Your dog only reacts to the change in environment. She will adjust and adapt herself to the life she now has.

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Get the most powerful air pump you can, and the airstone with the smallest pores (for tiny bubbles). Commonly, the wood airstones are used with skimmers. They make very small bubbles (with enough air pressure behind them), but they tend to clog and, being wood, they will eventually decay, all of which means they need to be replaced periodically. Air pump-powered skimmers are really somewhat anachronistic nowadays. The air-driven skimmers still work, but the more modern models are much more effecient for the same energy expenditure. <br>  How much will it cost? It depends on where you shop, of course, but you should be able to get a good pump for about $20 to $30.

DQcZWFHFaa	He sounds like he's just having stress from the other cats, if he's basically social with people and only goes nuts around other cats.  He'd probably be best in a single-cat house, but otherwise it sounds like he'd be fine. Nonetheless, I have some tips for if he does have a berserker personality.<br>  <br>  I've had cats who bite and go berserk before, sometimes from trauma, and sometimes from personality.  Either one can be calmed if you just give the cat some space, and learn to read the signs of when he's agitated.  Then you have to leave him alone or redirect him from his anger to something positive, like a treat.  I find it also helps to have a "kill" toy - usually a stuffed animal that he's encouraged to vent on when he really just needs to kill something.  They're a predatory species, and I think the instinct should be respected.  My boys both love their Stitch, which has big ears for biting and is as big as they are.  Finally, when they are agitated, use catspeak.  Look at them, then look away or close your eyes and slowly reopen.  Either one conveys that they are not in danger from you.  Trill or purr at them for a reinforced message of your own calm state.  Mostly, keep your cool, and don't let their behavior stress you, because they'll sense it and become more anxious.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|g62ATenqaa	Well he has obviously had a bad start in life but I am a firm believer that whatever his behaviour is now, with lots of love and patience he will become a loving pet and really give you endless pleasure.|`|pw8u5WQ9aa	Hmm see if the shelter will let sit with him in a room where there are no other cats. And go with your instinct He could just be acting out due to him not liking other cats & fearing he will be attack at any moment. But if you are thinking of bringing it home to your other cats. I would think about that twice unless you have a pretty big house. Good luck.|`|6E8Reeewaa	If you like the cat adopt him. Its really hard to judge an animals behavior in shelters, its almost never indicative of a cats real personality since they're under so much stress there. <br>  <br>  I adopted a cat a while ago and on the very first night at home he attacked me. It took years for him to trust me because he was abused with his previous owners, but now he's just an ornery part of my life. He got a little bit friendlier, but never attacked me again. <br>  <br>  I say adopt the little bugger. He's had a hard life so far and could do with a nice home.
owz03hgqaa	My rescue cat did this for 6 months. I'd say it's because he's had a hard life, and he's not used to you. Our cat is a big softy now, but it took a lot of care and attention to get him there.|`|zHmZkMStaa	Sorry; but that's very hard to predict.  Myself, I wouldn't risk it, and would choose another cat.  It's possible he's stressed out and will calm down - but there are no guarantees.  I would quiz the shelter workers more thoroughly, and see if they have a return policy if he is indeed just plain evil.  Good luck.<br>  PS: Always best to get a neutered male cat.  They're noticeably more affectionate and loyal than females.|`|hgmgH83Xaa	Hey, it sounds like this cat has been through a lot of trauma. Sometimes, a lot of love and patience can help a lot. You may want to ask the place where you got the cat for vet records (to rule out any organ disfuctions), but the cat seems to exhibit petting induced aggression. Read this article from pawprints and purrs, inc. I hope it helps:<br>  <br>  Some cats bite while being petted. Some cats are intolerant of all handling, but most cats with petting aggression accept a certain amount of petting but then become highly agitated and attack when they have had enough. This can be difficult to understand since many of these cats seek attention and at the outset seem to enjoy physical contact from the owner. It seems that these cats have a certain threshold for the amount of physical interaction that they can tolerate. Although the aggression may be a specific form that arises from arousal related to petting, fear and social status may also play a role. First, identify and avoid responses that might increase your cat’s fear or anxiety (e.g. punishment, uninvited approaches and handling) and make all handling experiences positive. When handling, physical restraint must be avoided as cats that are placed in a position where they feel constrained or unable to escape might become aggressive. The cat that assumes a leadership role in relationship to a family member may bite or attack that person, while avoiding aggression to a person who is more "dominant" in the relationship. (For diagnosis and treatment of social status aggression see below).<br>  <br>  In order to resolve petting induced aggression, make sure that the initiation and termination of petting is under your control. In addition your cat needs to learn that petting is not associated with excessive restraint or anything unpleasant but rather with rewards. Do not approach, confront, or lift your cat, unless it approaches for affection. At this point call the cat onto your lap (perhaps with a command, or bell), and begin light stroking without any physical restraint. After a brief session put the cat on the floor and give a reward such as food, play, or a catnip toy. At each subsequent session, when the cat is ready for affection, call the cat onto your lap, and pat or stroke a little longer before putting the cat down and providing the reward. Be aware that as you approach the limit of your cat’s tolerance of petting, anxiety and aggression will recur. This limit can often be evidenced by a change in the cat’s demeanour. Usually the cat will begin to rapidly move the tail back and forth, the pupils may dilate and the ears go back, or the cat may begin to lick or act agitated. Try and stay below this threshold and cease petting before the cat becomes anxious. Although shaping may greatly increase the number and length of petting sessions your cat will accept and enjoy, you will need to learn and accept your cat’s limitations.<br>  <br>  petting-induced aggression.|`|2vhXqnJzaa	He's been through a lot bless him by the sounds of things, if you want my honest opinion only take him if you are willing to give 200% and take him with the attitude 'its for life', the worst thing that could possibly happen to this cat is for someone to take him and then reject him as clearly he needs a lot of love and sounds like he needs an experienced previous cat owner. If you want a cat to pet and be affectionate then this isn't the one for you as there is no guarantee he will get any better, sometimes you have to except a cat warts and all, I have 3 and the youngest TC hated being touched or picked up for the first 12 months, took him a long time to accept us (he came from a farm and had been kept in an out shed with little human contact) its taken a lot of hard work to get him to this stage so unless you can offer the commitment you maybe better having either a kitten or a rescue cat that is already affectionate.|`|YCmveH6laa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I would like to  think that your new cat is nervous, anything will startle your cat at this moment because it will take your cat a lot of time and effort to get used to your surroundings and the people around you, bearing in mind that your cat was in care so you will need to be patient with your cat and it will need time for him to build trust in you.<br>  <br>  I f you ever take him home, please buy him alot of toys, that should keep your cat entertained and soon your cat will come to you. You will feed him and later your cat will understand the situation but remember not to shout and be gentle. <br>  <br>  If your cat ever try to run away from you ( like mine used to) never go after your cat,you may scare him/her! You can get a toy and play with it to get his/her attention and he or she will choose whether to feel comfortable to come to you. I t takes alot of time and patience beleive me. You have a nervouse cat and if your cat ever bites you, dont give him any attention, put he/she down on the floor and don't engage, you have to remember that your cat is confused so you will also have to train him/her.<br>  <br>  Remember it will take time, spend as much time as possible and stroke time always plenty.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qWPLDgPiaa	If the cat bit your friends hand GENTLY, then that's a sign of affection from the cat. the cat may have been treated badly, so he's afraid of you and your friend. If you are taking him home, it would be a good idea to train him first. might want to get cat spray, spray the cat if it does something bad, like biting you. it will eventually stop biting you. my cat did that once when I tried to tickle it under the chin, so I guess they don't like anyone petting them, some cats are like that.|`|eK2Rritoaa	my guess is, if it didnt like being with other animals and it was with other animal, Well its prolly trying to dominate The others.|`|uwZvkIvLaa	Not strange at all.  His first behaviour was excitement at getting attention.  Thus, he preferred human companionship to being alone.<br>  <br>  Biting action.<br>  <br>  Our 12-yr-old eldest of the three is very independent but loves being stroked when she's in the mood.  Eventually though, she will tire of the attention and give me a gentle nibble on my finger, telling me that's enough.<br>  <br>  If upset or angry about something, or frightened, she would bite down very hard, meaning this is not a warning but a defensive counter-attack.<br>  <br>  She dislikes any other cats ( frequently my wife brings in homeless kittens to give them a better start in life, check for medical problems in case a vet is needed, and eventually to find a home ).  Our eldest can't stand any of this and will hiss at any kitten even looking in her direction.  She will then pout and perhaps even run to the door and demand to be let out for a few hours.  What a big suck !!!<br>  <br>  Once you start feeding your cat at home, and then sometimes special treats like a tablespoon or two of warm milk, he will overcome his fierce survival instinct ( from serious injuries, pain, and perhaps painful medical procedures ) and start to become a member of your family, but still have some interesting personality quirks.<br>  <br>  Soooooo, don't worry.  Be happy !!  A little patience and trying to understand, will grace your family with many rewards in the near future.
enC9TvxUaa	-What about a cockatiel.  These are GREAT first time birds.  Very smart, loyal, and super affectionate!  Ours sits on my shoulder and goes with me everywhere in the house while I am doing anything!  They can learn to mimik some too!|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Well, I won't get voted best answer for this, but I'm going to tell you the truth anyway.<br>  <br>  You know how when you learned to ride a bicycle you had the training wheels for a while? That's how to get the kind of parrot you want. It's not the parrot, it's the owner and the way to learn is start with a smaller bird like a parakeet, parrotlet, lovebird or cockatiel. You do not automatically get a loving, affectionate, intelligent bird straight from the pet store or from most breeders without doing some of the work yourself. It's a "some assembly required" proposition. It's actually a lot of work and you have to be prepared to take care of the bird for 20+ years unless you're planning on being willfully neglectful. <br>  <br>  Who will take care of the bird when the family goes on vacation? Birds don't do so well when you leave them alone for a week with no fresh food or water. What will happen to the bird when you leave for college and only come home on breaks or holidays? Birds often feel a keen sense of abandonment when their person leaves. The stress can lead to a variety of illness including, but not limited to, feather plucking. Can you handle the vet bills for that? <br>  <br>  Sorry if this sounds harsh, but too many people think it's cool to have a bird until they find out how much work is involved, then there's no place for the bird in their lives. I've seen it over and over again. There are not enough rescues and shelters that can deal with birds to take care of them all. It makes me very sad and very angry. <br>  <br>  If you're serious go to www.mytoos.com and read that, then think about it for a while and realize that many parrots are not that different from the 'toos. If you're still game at that point, start doing some research and try to meet several different types of birds, talk to breeders and owners and then start making decisions. I won't even start on how expensive it is and that avian vets are few and far between and how essential it is to know your avian vet before you have an emergency. Emergencies also only happen at 3 am when the office isn't open and you need to be able to call your vet then. No, not even going there.<br>  <br>  I love my 'tiel with all my heart and wouldn't take anything for her, but I wouldn't have been able to be as good a mommy to her if I hadn't had parakeets first and learned how to take care of birds.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: African Grey's are very intelligent, sensitive and expensive birds--they are really not a good bird for a beginner. They need more intellectual stimulation than most people can be prepared for. Think of them as a 2 or 3 year old child that will NEVER grow up but will always be learning.|`|Qas05nZraa	cockatiel|`|xXDkTJcWaa	There are plenty of birds out there!:<br>  cockatiel: are great for beginners.

Cfk1kr8Daa	I think it's great that you care about him so much that you realize he'd love a pal -and one that would make him especially happy. What a very lucky guy!<br>  <br>    So, let's look at this from his perspective - he wants a pal that is already there, not some little cutesy wootsey puppy that is going to be A)cuter than he is , and B) take all his stuff.  <br>  <br>    No, you want to take him and interview some rescue dogs that are dog-friendly and of the size he believes he is - whether that be a male Lab or a lovely blonde Golden girlfriend - but HE needs to help you pick, and it needs to be a very submissive easygoing dog.<br>  <br>    By adopting an adult dog, you will have a better chance of them settling in together very shortly, instead of taking any chances that a baby will grow up to completely take over, and not be anyone he would have hoped for in the end.  You'll have a much better shot at getting the perfect combination by seeing what they are like when they are already that person.<br>  <br>    Keep in mind there will always be some gyrations when the new dog is settling in, no matter which one you pick.  Any dog will need to adjust, and your poodle will have some adjusting to do as well.  But starting with a dog that is already mature, you will know much more in advance.<br>  <br>    What fun - cruising for a sidekick!  Good luck!

It may even be that both your fish are female. two female may also pair up and lay eggs and look just like a male/female pair BUT the eggs never hatch. Its hard to sex angel fish, even harder to get good breeding stock from pet stores.<br>  <br>  Males will be bigger than Females of the same age. That's if they are both from the same batch. Males also tend to have more red in their eyes than females, but that's sometimes useless because allot of angel fish have had that trait bred out.<br>  <br>  If you really want to breed them just go to your local fish club or pet store that buys their angels locally and pick out 4 angels and you will get a pair outta them. Pick only the ones without clamped fins and with all their fins intact. DON'T pick out 4 of the biggest ones in the tank because you will get all males. Best to pick out 3 smaller ones and one big one. Again this only works if the angels are all of the same age  and where born at the same time. Hope this helped a little.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Wow, I think you should read a couple of books about angelfish.<br>  They don't get pregnant. They lay eggs which the male fertilizes after they are outside the female's body.<br>  <br>  Female angelfish have been known to lay eggs without any males being present, but of course these eggs are infertile (they don't hatch).|`|dE5fs9yzaa	That seems a trifle small to spawn yet. Mine were between half and silver dollar size in the body.  Even if she lays the eggs and theres no male following her, they wouldn't hatch. They are fertilized outside her body as they are being laid. The male dosn't mate with the female like live bearers.

MstjbpVJaa	They are moulting, it is quite normal for birds to loose their tail feathers first when coming into moult,if you watch carefully you will see that they loose one feather at a time from each wing,this is to keep them Flying.<br>  Wing feathers are replaced quicker than body or tail feathers.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	The finches tail feathers are most likely falling out due to molting or nutritional deficiencies.  Provide your finches with plenty of healthy foods such as fruits, veggies, and pellets.  All pet birds molt at least once a year.  This condition could be due to a molt.  You didn't mention any other symptoms, so I can only think of those two causes of the problem.  If your birds start showing any signs of illness, or if the tail feathers don't grow back within 4-6 weeks, then I would take the finches to the vet for an exam.|`|sWkcLzJtaa	Either they are molting or something really scared them|`|YMxVVjybaa	lol dont worry its natural thing ;)
EJpiaCMQaa	I wouldn't place a guinea pig with a parakeet.  They are different types of animals and require different kinds of food, toys, and housing.  Not to mention that the parakeet will be very scared of the guinea pig and will be very stressed out.  This can cause contribute to illness in the parakeet.  Guinea pigs should only live with other guinea pigs; parakeets with parakeets.  If you want a companion for your parakeet, please buy another parakeet.  Another option, place the two cages, one with the guinea pig and one with the parakeet, next to each other, so they can enjoy each other's company.|`|YvWpH3uXaa	NO!

Put it on the pee spot and watch it bubble. the peroxide kills the bacteria and baking soda takes away the smell. do not rub it in.

Hope it helps|`|e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Use an enzyme cleaner.  I use Nature's Miracle, which I found works the best.  The enzymes kill/eat/destroy the urine, and the dogs scent.  That's why he keeps going on the rug.  Do NOT use it sparingly.  You may need a number of applications before the scent gets out completely.  That is the key.  The scent needs to be out completely or your dog will continue to use the rug as a bathroom.  You have to get it out of the carpet, the padding and the floor underneath.  Let it soak in.  It will take at least 2 weeks for a full effect, and probably a number of applications.  Depending on how long your dog has been using the rug, it may start smelling worse.  DON'T give up.  The smell means it is working.  It also takes out the stain itself, and Nature's Miracle is guaranteed to work.  It is available at most pet stores.|`|171b862a18e6a8061d053088188f949faa	You really can never can get it completely out.No matter what you do if you remove the carpet you can still see the stains in the padding.I would suggest replace carpet with ceramic tile and remove dog from house.|`|15b48876ffd5505969947c3bfe59eb00aa	get a empty spray bottle, fill it half with white vinegar and the other part hot water, spray on the urine spot, let soak, about 10 minutes, soak up with paper towel.<br>  god bless you and merry christmas !!!!!!<br>  saint bernard breeder in indiana since 1977.|`|1ef00b7979609463ff39a34a2f48c3b0aa	Blot with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

05a3f519fe5eb34cd5766afa01022d92aa	My last dog was scared of folks too.  We got him from someone who got him from an abusive puppy farm (didn't know that prior).  SO ... we just loved him.  The entire faily lavished the dog with love, from petting him to giving him baths, to riding in the car, to playing fetch.  He eventually got secure with us, so we broadened his surroundings by taking him for walks, to the park, and to meet other dogs.  As we expanded his circle of known people, we lavished praise and pettings on him, to make sure he felt secure.  Eventually, he was so socialized that he'd wave his tail back and forth when a new person would come to the door ... not scared, not defensive, just eager to meet whomever was there.<br>  <br>  It's a long road, I have to tell you, but just imagine how wonderful this socializing is for the dog?  They are social animals and seek approval from the alpha dog (that would be you).  Just be loving, not critical, and know that the terror and fear comes from something real and horrible in his/her past.  I'm not saying it has to have been abuse, it could easily be an unfortunate encounter with a skunk or a loud noise.  Fear is real and can be combatted with patience and love.|`|0dbcab5a78b72d97386463d98eaa4726aa	If it is a genetic issue, there is not much you can do about it, If it is a socialization issue, you can try a slow, gradual attempt to socialize, but, do not expect much there either. I was given a dog to train several years ago, a female golden retriever, she was absolutely gorgeous and had the nicest temperament, as long as you were on the farm that she was born and raised in. No social fears at all. No environmental issues either. It was when this 2 year old dog was taken out of her element that she showed her true colors. She had gone to the bathroom all over the crate, refused to come out when I tried to take her out to clean it and just froze up. Of course the dog went back to the farm where it took her a few days to recover from that experience, and as far as I know has never left there since. If socialization does not happen at the crucial age of 8-16 weeks dogs will almost always have a problem later in life. If it is genetic, it is even worse. Try to expose her to as much real life as you can, but, do not expect miracles.|`|52fec195f0b6e25b848d21669f91f512aa	take it slow, intro him by have him sniff peoples hand and they need to be @ his level.|`|9ac084f3d0160138ddeb8780da3f9060aa	Go to this website for tips on how to socialize your dog.

However, they have to be socially oriented into their setting.  This means starting with a few people that are told to be gentle and soft spoken with the dog.

Take her to obedience classes-this will socialize her with other people/dogs.  If she appears scared do not "comfort" her by petting her.  If you do you will reinforce the negative behavior.

d84efae1f882fe5bdb32f94b968b0cd4aa	That Is just an Example of No Disobedience , or Training. If you want your puppy to stop peeing everywhere its of 2 reasons , 1. your puppy is a puppy , it doesnt know better , 2. you dont take it out often. Puppies go out more often than older dogs. Because they have a small bladder.<br>  <br>  Here are some things you can do.....<br>  <br>  1. Watch The Show called "The dog whisperer"<br>  2.Start Training Your puppy<br>  3. Take it out more often<br>  4. keep her in that crate if she barks then put her in the crate into the garage, because when she barks that means she is in an unsable, insecure state-of-mind' but when she barks and you walk in that means that you are feeding this energy which will keep her barking. But if you dont answer her when she barks she will see and know that you are calm and that you are the "Pack Leader". Each house of every family is a "Pack". And when a dog does something bad you have to discipline because you always correct a bad behavior. Its what pack leaders do. Now when she pee's on the carpet the way to correct it is that you have to give her a Push on the neck with your fingers extended like dog teeth and just push her ( This is like a bite from a dominant pack leader) , Or you let her Lay down on the back, ( this show her that when a dog lays on its back it is being puished from doing something Bad ( like peeing on carpet) .<br>  <br>  By the way his Show Sometimes comes on the History- Geographic channel.   Good Luck!|`|21c3a0271ec00acf3a9d69ae016b4f6caa	well for one you have to tell her in a stern voice that she was bad that's the way to teach her and you have to rub her noise in it or she will never learn|`|980793a31c1ca0c49551f6aa02e2ace2aa	I suggest using Arm & Hammer brand pet powder. First, you should know dogs pee in places to mark "their spot". So A & H POWDER  is to teach the dog not to pee in that spot. It erases the smell of pee and gives the dog an unappealing smell (even though it smells good to humans) so the dog will stop peeing in that sprot. Vaccuum the powder up after it has sat there for a few minutes. You can buy it at most drug stores.|`|b1ae06a1fe2d43f0d327dad7eaab1ab0aa	Sorry but taking her to the garage and letting her pee on puuppy pads is the same thing as peeing on the carpet and peeing inside.

dffa96b557ec4334b6559956456f1dc8aa	Your tank is only two weeks old! Don't rush it, i am assuming that your other fish is only two weeks old, parameters usually read correct for the first couple of weeks until you start your cycling. The red tetra's must be more susceptible to your water conditions then the other fish you have. you should start out with something decently hardy and only a couple because More then likely they will die. You tank will cycle bring the ammonia up first and then the nitrites and then nitrates. You know that your tank has gone through a cycle when you have nitrates. Nitrites and ammonia should be 0 when you test your water. Nitrates can be as high as 20 but better in lower increments. Also you MUST acclimate the fish in your tank by adding your water to the bag they come in. DO NOT add the pet stores water to your SYSTEM because you have NO IDEA how their water quality is. Also a note on cleaning, f you have a gravel system allow your bacteria to grow by only cleaning and suctioning the gravel In 1/4 increments about every two weeks.

Quem gosta é sapo.|`|7e4e678f3871f9d7ec791969476ce809aa	Medo excessivo de ruídos<br>  <br>  Existem c?es que têm medo excessivo de determinados ruídos... Se imaginarmos que eles têm uma capacidade auditiva quase quatro vezes maior que a nossa, um ruído sem importancia para nós pode ser ensurdecedor para eles.<br>  <br>  Os ruídos que costumam causar panico nos animais s?o fogos de artifício, máquinas de tosa ou secadores, trov?es, tiros, etc.. Os c?es pulam no colo do dono, tremem excessivamente, o cora??o dispara e eles tentam se esconder em lugares pouco comuns, permanecendo lá sem comer, beber ou sair para fazer suas necessidades...<br>  <br>  Alguns donos podem achar isso até engra?ado, porém, se o animal tiver alguma altera??o cardíaca severa, a taquicardia (aceleramento do cora??o) que o medo excessivo provoca poderá causar problemas à saúde do animal, principalmente se ele for idoso.<br>  <br>  Se fobia a ruídos é o problema do seu amig?o e você se preocupa com a rea??o dele nos dias de fogos ou tempestades, veja as dicas de Cláudia Pizzolato, treinadora de c?es diplomada pela NDTA (National Dog Trainers Association) nos USA e proprietária da Lord C?o - www.lordcao.com, no Rio de Janeiro:<br>  <br>  Trabalhar com dessensibiliza??o: ter gravado em cassete ou CD os sons que deixam o animal paralisado de medo (à venda no site www.bitcao.com.br). Colocar o som MUITO baixo, quase imperceptível, e motivar o c?o a repetir qualquer rotina que ele goste muito, como jogar bolinha, comer biscoito, etc.. No início é preciso fazer estes exercícios num local e horário bastante calmos e neutros. Só devemos passar adiante quando o c?o já estiver suportando o barulho que o incomoda, num nível normal.<br>  <br>  N?o recompensar involuntariamente: é preciso ter muito cuidado para n?o dar carinho e aten??o ao animal quando ele estiver com medo para n?o recompensá-lo, involuntariamente, por ter medo. Nada de tentar acalmar o c?o ou segurá-lo no colo. Em último caso é preciso deixar um local preparado para que o animal possa se esconder e sentir seguro, como numa toca.<br>  <br>  Usar medica??o: alguns veterinários preconizam doses diárias de antidepressivos, ministrados nos dias em que se suspeita que haverá ruídos que causem panico ao c?o. A medica??o tem que ser dada antes do cachorro come?ar a ficar apavorado e pode evitar crises médias ou leves de panico. Para casos graves de fobias causadas por sons, como fogos de artifício, tempestades, trov?es ou armas de fogo, outras drogas podem ser utilizadas, sempre a critério e sob prescri??o do veterinário.<br>  <br>  Segundo Cláudia, o medo excessivo de ruídos é um dos problemas mais difíceis para serem tratados em comportamento canino, especialmente em casos graves. De qualquer forma vale a pena tentar.<br>  <br>  No caso de c?es que se estressam com o barulho de máquinas de tosa e secadores, utilize chuma?os de algod?o nos ouvidos do animal, para diminuir o ruído. Isso também pode ser tentado em dias de tempestade ou fogos de artifício. Mas é claro, esse "truque" n?o terá efeito algum em animais extremamente medrosos.<br>  <br>  Procure assegurar-se que o c?o n?o possa fugir em momentos de grande manifesta??o de medo. é comum os animais se desesperarem e saírem em disparado em dire??o à rua. Prenda o c?o em dias de comemora??es com fogos e roj?es.<br>  <br>  Consulte o veterinário que trata do seu animal. Caso ele julgue conveniente, medicará o seu animal para enfrentar o medo ou encaminhará você a um especialista em comportamento para tratar seu c?o. Associando as medica??es alopática, homeopática ou alternativa (Florais de Bach), a uma mudan?a de postura do dono em rela??o ao c?o, há chances dele superar a FOBIA.<br>  <br>  <br>  Silvia C.

It only lasted about a year tho, before the train came along. A rider would gallop one horse/pony for about 20 or more miles, then he would stop at a rest station to trade horses, and continue on like this until nightfall, then he would stop and rest then continue on in the morning. And recently a man came up with Pony Xpression, Wayne Wolf of Marilla, New York. He takes messages to people, by horseback.

A rider would ride at very fast speeds from station to station with the mail.  When he'd get to a new station, he would switch horses so not to overwork a horse.  That or he would pass the mail off to a different rider and horse combo so he could rest until the next rider came in. They had to deal with outlaws and native indians out to get them.

7e4e678f3871f9d7ec791969476ce809aa	Texto Luis Roberto Toledo<br>  Fotos Ernesto de Souza<br>  <br>  A espécie nilótica, com gaiolas de cria??o ao fundo e ovos na incubadora (acima): produ??o incorpora técnicas mais avan?adas<br>  Há quem sustente que a tilápia é o peixe citado na passagem bíblica da multiplica??o dos alimentos, quando Jesus conseguiu saciar a fome de uma multid?o apenas a partir de dois peixinhos e de um punhado de p?es. A teoria tem fundamento, pois algumas espécies de tilápia s?o originárias da regi?o entre o Oriente Médio e o Norte da áfrica. Mas, seja ou n?o o peixe de que fala o Evangelho, multiplica??o é com a tilápia mesmo. Ela apresenta notável capacidade de reprodu??o, o que torna muito mais trabalhoso conter sua prolifera??o do que promover seu acasalamento.<br>  <br>  Suas qualidades, entretanto, n?o se resumem à prolificidade. Possui carne de sabor suave e pouca gordura, diferentemente da maioria dos peixes de água doce. Também oferece boa convers?o alimentar e crescimento veloz, suporta níveis baixos de oxigênio na água e pode até mesmo ser submetida à cria??o em água salgada. Tantos pontos favoráveis têm levado a tilápia a ser protagonista de um “milagre” moderno, o da multiplica??o em criatórios do mundo todo. Principalmente com rela??o à espécie Oreochromis nilotica, ou tilápia-do-nilo, que tem bom rendimento de filé e é a predileta dos piscicultores.<br>  <br>  Calcula-se que a produ??o global do peixe, entre captura e cultivo, esteja próxima de 1 milh?o de toneladas anuais. O Brasil colabora com estimadas 40 mil toneladas ao ano. A tilápia já domina a piscicultura no país, mas, por enquanto, a maioria dos exemplares nacionais é destinada ao povoamento dos chamados pesque-pagues. O cenário come?a a ser alterado com a crescente utiliza??o do peixe no aproveitamento industrial, para a obten??o de filés e outros cortes.<br>  <br>  Despesca na Fazenda Belmonte, PR: engorda do peixe levou também à obten??o de alevinos<br>  <br>  O processamento é quase sempre realizado em escala reduzida, em frigoríficos de pequeno porte. A boa resposta do mercado, entretanto, tem ampliado o número de estabelecimentos envolvidos na atividade e despertado o interesse de grandes empresas. A Sadia, por exemplo, já incluiu dois pratos à base de tilápia em sua linha light de produtos elaborados e congelados. Essa nova realidade é complementada por mudan?as no manejo para a obten??o de alevinos (os “filhotes” de peixe) e na engorda de exemplares nos tanques, processos que passaram a incorporar técnicas mais modernas e eficientes.<br>  <br>  INVERS?O “Ainda n?o existem grandes frigoríficos voltados ao abate de tilápias no Brasil porque a produ??o é pequena e os pesqueiros absorvem quase tudo”, acredita Ricardo Neukirchner, da piscicultura Aquabel, de Rolandia, PR. “Isso deve se inverter em poucos anos, pois há redes de supermercado ‘implorando’ pelo peixe e alta demanda para exporta??o.” Neukirchner é sócio da empresa que produz mensalmente 2 milh?es de alevinos de tilápia, despachados para todas as partes do país. E ainda gerencia sozinho a engorda em 6,5 hectares de tanques. Foi com esse último negócio que ele entrou para a piscicultura, há seis anos, como forma de viabilizar a fazenda da família, a Belmonte. A propriedade era voltada, até ent?o, principalmente à produ??o de arroz irrigado, que n?o vinha dando bons resultados econ?micos. Parte das terras foi arrendada e tanques para cria??o de peixes foram escavados, aproveitando-se os patamares da cultura de arroz e a boa oferta de água.<br>  A tilápia, escolhida para o povoamento, deu bons resultados comerciais, e logo Neukirchner resolveu aventurar-se também na alevinagem, criando a Aquabel. Para tanto, associou-se ao pai Bernd e ao técnico em piscicultura Cláudio Batirola, que trouxe a experiência com o mercado de tilápia acumulada em sua terra natal Toledo, no oeste paranaense, regi?o pioneira na cria??o do peixe.<br>  <br>  Para formar seu plantel de matrizes, a empresa teve acesso a material genético trazido da Tailandia em 1996 pelo governo brasileiro, para reduzir problemas de consangüinidade nas cria??es nacionais. As tilápias tailandesas apresentam crescimento acelerado e maior rendimento de carca?a. Outro refor?o para a empresa de Rolandia foi a consultoria técnica de Sérgio Zimmermann, da Ulbra — Universidade Luterana Brasileira, de Porto Alegre, RS. Autoridade na cria??o de tilápias, o professor e pesquisador trouxe, também da Tailandia, uma tecnologia ainda pouco difundida no Brasil, para a obten??o de lotes de alevinos compostos exclusivamente por machos (leia “Um ‘clube’ onde fêmea n?o entra”).<br>  <br>  FILIAL As laminas d’água da Aquabel ocupam 5,5 hectares, um dos quais sob estufas. “Essas estruturas têm custo muito alto, mas preciso delas para conseguir reprodu??o e fazer estoque de alevinos nos meses de inverno, quando as temperaturas s?o muito baixas na regi?o”, explica Neukirchner. Ele pretende aumentar em breve o número de matrizes e a área de estufas, para chegar à produ??o mensal de 3 milh?es de alevinos. Também est?o em seus planos abrir uma filial, ainda sem local definido, mas certamente numa regi?o de clima mais quente durante o ano todo, dispensando as estufas. A expectativa de crescimento da atividade justificaria a expans?o dos negócios. “Quem se tornar fornecedor para os frigoríficos irá trabalhar com margens mais apertadas de lucro do que quem vende para o mercado de pesqueiros, que paga melhor, mas já dá mostras de satura??o”, analisa o gerente da Aquabel. “Cada vez mais, os criadores ter?o que se profissionalizar para segurar custos, através, por exemplo, da engorda de alevinos produzidos com a tecnologia que utilizamos aqui.”<br>  <br>  Cairo Bierhals, da Supertilapia, na estufa com água aquecida: profissionalismo<br>  <br>  A Supertilapia, de Viam?o, RS, na Grande Porto Alegre, também aposta na amplia??o e na profissionaliza??o do setor. Administrada pelos irm?os Cairo e Cícero Bierhals, essa empresa dedicada à produ??o de alevinos de tilápia tailandesa usa estufas e sistema de aquecimento da água dos tanques, em caldeira a diesel, para obter a reprodu??o mesmo sob as baixas temperaturas do inverno gaúcho. O maior diferencial da Supertilapia é que ela oferece ao mercado n?o apenas o alevino “comum”, que tem cerca de 1 grama de peso, mas também a chamada forma juvenil, um alevino maior, de 10 centímetros e cerca de 20 gramas.<br>  <br>  “Com essas características, ele é mais resistente e tem taxa de sobrevivência muito maior nos a?udes, de cerca de 98%”, garante Cairo Bierhals. Outra vantagem é que o piscicultor “ganha” 60 dias de engorda, tempo que levaria para fazer o alevino alcan?ar esse peso, e pode conseguir nova safra na propriedade. O juvenil é também a forma mais apropriada para o sistema de cria??o em gaiolas (leia “Tilápias engaioladas em área de pecuária”). A produ??o mensal da empresa é de 800 mil alevinos; 300 mil deles s?o juvenis, mas o objetivo é que estes representem 80% do total.<br>  <br>  MONITORAMENTO Além de vender alevinos, a Supertilapia fornece servi?o de assistência técnica aos criadores. O processo de engorda pode ser monitorado pela empresa, que ainda oferece a possibilidade de fazer a despesca e procurar compradores para o peixe gordo. A piscicultura gaúcha realizou a exporta??o para os Estados Unidos de 11 toneladas de tilápia, produzidas por um de seus clientes e processadas por um frigorífico de Rio Grande. Neste ano, os irm?os Bierhals esperam enviar nova remessa, com peixes de engorda própria.<br>  A venda aos pesque-pagues ainda deverá se manter firme por muito tempo, apesar das expectativas de aumento do uso industrial do peixe e do acirramento da disputa para o fornecimento do produto aos pesqueiros. No entanto, muitos dos envolvidos nesse segmento já come?am a repensar suas atividades. Como Jo?o Carlos Rogério, proprietário do pesque-pague Bandeirantes, em Rolandia, vizinho à Aquabel. Seus dez tanques recebem cerca de 1.000 visitantes por mês, dos quais 70% preferem ficar nas margens dos tanques povoados com tilápias. “Isso por ser o peixe mais barato, mas também por ter carne branca e com muito menos gordura que os demais”, afirma Rogério.<br>  <br>  Com base nas preferências de seu público, Jo?o Carlos Rogério projetou a constru??o de um frigorífico que estará pronto no primeiro semestre deste ano. A planta deverá processar 300 quilos de tilápia por dia, em artigos como filés, hambúrgueres e “nuggets”. A inten??o é abastecer os mercados de Londrina e Maringá, competindo assim com as pequenas indústrias já instaladas em Toledo, pólo paranaense mais tradicional na produ??o do peixe.<br>  <br>  Maringá também está prestes a ganhar seu frigorífico. A iniciativa é de Ant?nio Leal da Cunha, que engorda o peixe em 3 hectares na Fazenda Santa Juliana. O sistema de cultivo intensivo ali adotado — com viveiros sob estufa, tanques com fundo de lona e aeradores para promover maior oxigena??o da água, por exemplo — permite a obten??o de até 80 toneladas anuais de pescado. A idéia de montar um frigorífico veio com o surgimento de excedente da produ??o destinada a pesqueiros. “Essa é uma oportunidade para atuar num segmento que tem muito potencial de crescimento”, afirma Celso Seratto, agr?nomo da Emater-PR que presta servi?o à Fazenda Santa Juliana. A capacidade instalada do frigorífico será de 50 toneladas de filé ao ano. E há mercado para tudo isso? “Mercado existe, certamente, mas será preciso investir também no incentivo ao consumo”, responde o agr?nomo.<br>  Piscicultura<br>  Tilápias engaioladas em área de pecuária<br>  <br>  Criador engorda peixes em tanque-rede e processa o pescado no frigorífico instalado em sua propriedade<br>  <br>  Balsa para auxiliar o manejo<br>  <br>  A primeira rea??o de Paulo Martins, ao ouvir as idéias do filho Rodrigo sobre instalar um projeto de piscicultura na propriedade da família, voltada para a pecuária de corte, foi torcer o nariz. Mas, nestes cinco anos desde o primeiro “namoro” com a atividade, o estudante de zootecnia n?o só conseguiu “dobrar” o pai, implantando o projeto na fazenda de gado, como provou que o negócio era viável. E ainda contou com a ajuda de Paulo para sanar algumas dificuldades no manejo da cria??o. “Ainda acho mais fácil produzir novilhos precoces, pois o peixe é mais melindroso. Um erro qualquer no manejo nem sempre dá para ser consertado e pode p?r tudo a perder”, afirma o pecuarista.<br>  <br>  Na Piscicultura Santa Cecília, em Euclides da Cunha Paulista, SP, administrada por Rodrigo Martins, as tilápias s?o criadas em tanques-redes, espécies de gaiolas, e alimentadas com ra??o. Os equipamentos ficam mergulhados numa lagoa às margens da represa da Usina Hidrelétrica de Rosana, no Rio Paranapanema, na fronteira entre os estados de S?o Paulo e Paraná. A lagoa é, na verdade, um córrego que cortava a propriedade dos Martins, que se encheu com o fechamento da barragem. No total, s?o 106 gaiolas, enfileiradas em longos cord?es, e que abrigam, cada uma, de 50 a 200 quilos de peixe por metro cúbico. O sucesso do sistema, bastante intensivo, é em boa parte assegurado pelo alto índice de renova??o da água, que garante sua qualidade.<br>  <br>  Desde o início do empreendimento, Rodrigo percebeu que haveria dificuldades para a venda de peixes aos pesqueiros, devido à grande concorrência. Assim, decidiu que seria preciso montar um frigorífico para abater e processar as tilápias. A pequena indústria tem capacidade para trabalhar com 800 quilos de pescado por dia, onde s?o preparados os cortes de filé, filé empanado, filé nobre (área lombar do peixe), espetinho, petisco e sashimi. O frigorífico também vende a tilápia apenas eviscerada e em filé com pele, para restaurantes de cozinha francesa. A Santa Cecília, credenciada para a comercializa??o nos limites do estado de S?o Paulo, também faz entregas a bares, choperias, hotéis, bufês e a quatro pontos de venda no interior paulista. Um de seus principais clientes é a cadeia de restaurantes de estrada Frango Assado, à qual entrega 400 quilos semanalmente. A piscicultura também comercializa a pele da tilápia, que é congelada e segue para um curtume no Paraná.<br>  <br>  Rodrigo Martins: preparo de filés empanados, sashimis e espetinhos de tilápia<br>  <br>  Para aumentar a capacidade de alojamento da piscicultura e diminuir os riscos da utiliza??o de alevinos em tanque-rede (que s?o mais frágeis e ainda podem escapar pelas malhas das gaiolas), Rodrigo Martins terceirizou a fase inicial da cria??o. Ele fez uma parceria com um engordador de um município vizinho, ao qual entrega os alevinos comprados da Aquabel, de Rolandia, PR, e a ra??o, pagando 2,20 reais pelo quilo de tilápias juvenis, que chegam a Euclides da Cunha pesando 100 gramas cada uma. Elas s?o ent?o colocadas nos tanques-redes, onde permanecem entre três e quatro meses, quando ent?o estar?o pesando cerca de 700 gramas. No dia anterior ao abate, é feita a depura??o das tilápias, que permanecem em jejum nas gaiolas. Inicialmente, a coleta dos peixes era realizada trazendo-se os tanques-redes para a margem. Isso, entretanto, provocava grande estresse nos exemplares, além de necessitar de muita m?o-de-obra. Para facilitar o trabalho, o pecuarista Paulo Martins projetou uma balsa que é levada até as gaiolas. Ela possui arma??es de metal onde o tanque-rede é suspenso e aberto, retirando-se ent?o as tilápias, que s?o colocadas em caixas contendo gelo e água clorada. O custo de produ??o do quilo de peixe na Santa Cecília está entre 1,40 e 1,50 real, segundo Rodrigo. Já o pre?o do quilo dos cortes varia de 7,50 a 10 reais.|`|a4c3cbe6826159e2c4469ec67a1c8230aa	n?o pois lá só dá bandido|`|l7FZniOqaa	o peixe tilápia pode ser produzido em todos os estados.|`|18eb02df503f149d02b4fe584be05093aa	Consulte este site, eles s?o especialistas no assunto.<br>  www.centraldopeixe.com.br|`|40c6ae177718f873df559febdf610381aa	A Tilápia se adapta a qualquer lugar do Brasil.|`|21a007f6d0023e8591055c37d507ca9aaa	Sim,em tanques devidamente adaptados para isso-bom querer criá-los-,há estudos científicos que comprovam ter sua carne substancias medicinais,m?os à obra uma boa escolha.Abra?o amigo.|`|8410e81c71398b0d96d1b60bc5e42556aa	Se n?o for pego por uma blitz falsa, uma bala perdida, um bonde ou um sequestro relampago, pode.|`|a3ef8ba210f97a1ecb48488bd7cf71e6aa	Sim, em tanques.′Tem carne muito gostosa.|`|a5d445a3dab67e38711976f94a514a79aa	O peixe tilápia se adapta a qualquer clima, mas n?o esque?a que é peixe de água doce, portanto tem que haver cuidados e uma oxigena??o adequada para que os mesmos se propaguem com uma boa qualidade.

TxHLnfKUaa	You don't need a fitness trainer for your dog.  Your first step would be to control his eating habits.  Here are some tips on how to control your dog's weight:<br>  <br>      *  Cut out all treats and table scraps during the weight loss period.<br>      * Because the primary reason for obesity in dogs is overeating, you should divide the daily food allowance for dogs into two to four small meals a day. Do not use "free-choice" feeding.<br>      * Weigh your dog at the same time of day at least once a week. Keep a weight record.<br>      * Feed your dogs one at a time. A dieting dog may move to the bowl of his housemate to get more food.<br>      * Feed dogs before you eat and keep them in another room during meals to discourage begging.<br>      * Restrict your dog's unsupervised outdoor activity so that he may not scavenge for food when outside. Make sure that indoor and outdoor garbage cans have secure covers.<br>      * Tell your neighbors about your dog's weight loss program, to avoid their feeding your dog.<br>      * Always provide plenty of clean, fresh water.<br>      * Dogs should be taken to see their veterinarian at least once a year.<br>      * Exercise your dog on a regular basis, starting slowly with short activity periods, and gradually increase the exercise time. Begin with walking and, when your pet shows signs of increased fitness, move to games that require running, such as "fetch."|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You could cut down on your fitness trainer if you'd give your dog the exercise he needs!<br>  <br>  Just make sure you realize that just like a person who's way out of shape, a dog also has to be worked onto an exercise regime - he can't start out jogging a mile, he needs to work up to it.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to cut down on the amount of food your dog's getting, as well as cut out the treats if you want your dog to enjoy a long and healthy life.|`|285a20f9e8fdafeded87c39ec63e3044aa	why dont u run with the dog, that way you and your dog will get an excerise|`|171097ffb52730209b0f5871e80b23c4aa	If you are doing fitness then maybe instead of Running on a Tredmill or so..

AA11631648	15 is old for a dog. I had a little yorkie-poo that started doing this...it finally got so bad, losing bladder control and bowel control that I had to put her to sleep...she too was 15. It was that hardest thing I've ever had to do. But she wasn't miserable anymore. Does she show any other signs or "old age"?  It may be time to talk to the vet. If she's losing bladder control, it could be old age or a serious problem. A urinary tract infection? Kidney infection or failure. YOU are th human and need to make the decision of how to help her.

02b8c567a5af62959d05cd811ac28cc9aa	The missing cory and the betta's bloat ARE related, but it's just because the water is fouled with ammonia from the dead body.<br>  <br>  Look around the tank very carefully. Move the decor and plants if you need to. When fish die they quickly turn gray and very hard to see. Also, after that much time, the other fish have surely eaten everything but the head and the bones.<br>  <br>  Once you've found it, you'll need to do some daily water changes for a little while to get the ammonia levels back down to zero. Your betta really needs clean water to help him fight whatever is wrong with him.|`|L3L1rkTdaa	well, bettas are carnivors, but i doubt that it ate your fish. they prefer to eat smaller fish  and eat the whole thing. maybe something else could have gotten into your tank?<br>  still, i would separate the two kinds of fish|`|4400944ac639d7e3a061286a622149cbaa	The butler did it.|`|NUYMlrTGaa	Have your water tested. Perhaps mom was over feeding. The bloating is often a sign of constipation, but it could be another sickness. If the Cory died and wasn't removed the other fish probably did snack on him but it would have really screwed up your water quality. As I said have it tested I suspect something will be off.<br>  <br>  Discoloration is often a sign off low alkalinity.|`|pVE7paxGaa	your beta fish probably ate your cat fish. you need to seperate him immediaely because beta fish are only supposed to be with their own kind if their the opposite sex. you can never put them with other fish.
AHH42xmqaa	Well depends on how mad you want to get rid of them.  I knew that you can go to like a home depot and get this thing that gets rid of all birds within like a 100 yard radius or so.  It works off high tone noises that we can't hear but birds can.  Since it's sooo annoying they just decide to get away.  Some places use this instead of shocking them with wires but that only really works to get them not too pop certain places.  Give this a try but it's like $300 for the system....|`|AA10073685	why dont you kill all of nature and the animals that live freely? i mean they really are noisey, they should die so you can sleep|`|AA11909406	You could try placing a plastic owl or rubber snake near your window. This only works on some birds, but it might help.<br>  <br>  I know I am opinionated, but I just can't help wonder why so  many hate it when nature gets too noisy. I would much rather "put up" with squawking/singing birds than listen to one sided cell phone conversations where ever I go. Plus when compared to the noise of fighter jets taking off and landing all day and night, I'll take those pesky birds anytime!<br>  <br>  The sound of nature acting natural should be taken as reassurance everything in your area is okay. The absence of nature's noise should be more worrisome.|`|FHed8orfaa	No idea what kind of birds they are - but maybe get one of those fake plastic owls and put it somewhere very visible in the tree (many hardware stores carry them) - the predatory bird silhouette may keep them away - you may need to move it every few weeks to keep them guessing if its real - otherwise if it never moves they figure this out quicker.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Mockingbirds are notorious night singers...it is breeding season and this will probably go on for another few months.

eb7b3f653ea0e97bafa2dd3ddf8e6ac8aa	Well, you didn't mention what gph your power filter is and you didn't mention what type of fish you have.  But, not knowing this, the first link is an over-the-top complete package, which is great and will do more than everything you'd ever want, but if your intention was to just add a canister, this is not what you're looking for.  You would just have to get rid of your power filter in this case.  The second one is a nice, basic canister that would do the job of just an addition as you have indicated you want.  The last link is a top of the line canister which would do everything you wanted, plus more, plus have the option of adding on the extras that the first link has.  So, number 2 would be the basic add-on that you indicated you were looking for.  Number 3 would work for what you want now, but is very nice and hs the options for a transitional pump and Number 1 is a whole new system.  So, if you're looking for a basic, Number 2.  My next suggestion would be Number 3.|`|b5fa40420304fe098851c6d41e9b7d7daa	I prefer the magnum 350.  I have 2 of them.   They work great in everything except fine sand substrates.     The impeller is at the bottom, so any air that gets sucked in doesn't make much noise.   Its micron cartridges work well if you wrap them up to polish the water.   The carbon container has a ton of room for media.   There are very few parts to remove / service.  In addition, you can just wrap up the container or catridge with generic poly fiber for floss, or you can get pre-cut filter pads on ebay for $1 per pad.   The long term expense of the filter is very good since you can employ a lot of DIY materials without hastle in it.  <br>  <br>  Just make sure you get the model that comes with the quick disconnect conntectors for the hoses.  They're $18 on their own, and you will be getting stuck buying them one way or another. <br>  <br>  Also, its not a bad idea to get the model with the gravel vac... you can hook it up to the output and use it as a powered hose to drain the tank when it comes times for water changes.|`|42d2e9ef43ee3d223044187bc53e4410aa	Pass on all of them.

AA11927453	Cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) is a genetic defect and usually means one of the dogs parents passed it on to the pup...so, yes, it IS hereditary. I believe it is also a common genetic problem in Poodles. <br>   Also, dogs with one testicle are at higher risk for testicular cancer and you should have your dog neutered asap. And your dog is still able to breed...I advise against it as you will just be passing along this problem. Best bet is to neuter.|`|8ceb62d4b80b19d9a1d44d5f1834737aaa	It's called having an undescended testicle.

The other testicle is there up toward the stomach.   He should definitely be neutered!  It's best for his health. It will cost you a little more because it's a more involved surgery.  He can still produce puppies. My Dogue de Bordeaux produced 2 litters before I had him neutered.   If not neutered it CAN cause problems down the road.  None of his sons had this problem.  <br>  Now if your poodle is really young (under 3 months or so) there is still a chance the other testicle will drop soon.  I had a Dane like that once and it did drop down but you could also feel it if you sat him on your lap and checked with your hand.|`|b1ae06a1fe2d43f0d327dad7eaab1ab0aa	It can be heriditary but it can just be a fluke also. I would call your breeder and let them know.  But you do have to get this taken care of because it can cause a lot of trouble down the road. Took in a stray that was like that and it ended up costing me alot of money.  If it had been taken care of as a puppy it wouldn't have been that bad. Good luck to you.

AA10214259	I have a yorkie who is now 2 but when he was around 7 months to about 1 year and 4  months he usta chew everything but his chew toys asnd they have to chew...so buy him chew toys that last a long time or good tasting ones like hard bones ursed to clean their teeth.... they love those or they also have liek sticks they are small and taste liek diffrent meat and they go crazy for them...so yah i think three is good as long as they will last a long time and you might wanna get some that in the end he will consume but take a while.  BUT DNT FORGET TO HIDE UR SHOES>...good luck|`|ciwCqKUfaa	my 5 month shih tzu  has around 25 toys but she is givin chew sticks every other day or when nedded.  so as long as your rat terrier isn't chewing your stuff then your doing fine|`|86e8f65fa3192e60e44157e03e75769daa	Pups love to chew and play...my motto is "the more the better"...let your budget be your guide.  :)
461fb51bbcea02038938960db9d30f62aa	If you are the one who gives all the care and love to this dog, then it has a closer bond to you, and if you are gone all day to work or where ever, he might feel abandoned. He will find your scent on your clothes and things and take out his aggression on them.|`|86e8f65fa3192e60e44157e03e75769daa	Well, if your dog is more "your" dog, then he/she is probably just trying to be close to you, when you are not there. He/she likes your scent better. I would suggest you keep your closet door (or bedroom door) closed and replace the clothes and shoes with doggie chews.  :)|`|Bs4gKnDAaa	maybe because your husband tells your dog to do that or your dog just likes your husband better then you.|`|jsLaUPN7aa	Animals react differently to familiar scents.  In your absence, it was probably lonely and clung to something familiar.  Chewing or destroying is not an act of malice to an animal, just an instinct.  Make sure to put your clothes an shoes to where it can't get to them.  If you have a younger animal, this is probably just a teething phase it is going through.|`|obBvZs1saa	He LUVS your scent|`|tRTZWePEaa	He loves you|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Cause you leave your stuff out and around so that the dog can get it ?!?|`|v51ITaO8aa	stuff what does it mean
Mc8nnLWXaa	Crate training works wonders. Keeping your dog in a crate when your not home teaches them to hold it. The crate must give them very little room to walk around within it, if they have too much room they will just go in a far corner and then go back to sleep, this is why most crates are adjustable. As soon as you walk through the door you should take your dog out. When he goes potty you must pet him and kiss him and give him a treat. He will never go potty in the house again!|`|AA11780674	Put the pup on a lease - walk them until they go - reward them and BRING THEM BACK IN THE HOUSE.<br>  <br>  If you just let them out - they play and forget what they are doing.<br>  <br>  What I did was tie a very large bell on a ribbon to my back door knob, every time I took her outside I took her paw ans hit the bell - we walked out - she did her business and she was rewarded.<br>  <br>  Hubands said that the dog would NEVER learn to hit the bell.....<br>  <br>  WRONG - she walks up to it and hits it every SINGLE TIME SHE WANTS TO GO OUT!!!<br>  <br>  She is only ONE!  Smart Pek!|`|4bf907022355e21adc44bf453e0f4c0aaa	Take him/her out OFTEN, and praise him when he goes...give a treat on the spot. Slowly, leave more time between trips. Indoors, teach him to understand "want to go outside" (ask excitedly), and he will start to understand. Eventually, he should start to let YOU know when he wants to go (stand by door, fidget and follow you around like he wants to tell you something), but this will take time. Praise and reward is what it's all about for dogs!|`|Hh9GpPLAaa	My best advise on this is to definitely crate train the dog if you are not already doing so.  We crate trained our last dog and what a difference!!  We don't use the crate anymore but it certainly helped a lot during his first year or so.  They will learn to love their crate as it feels like their secure space if done right.  Don't ever use the crate as punishment however, they will learn to hate it.  See the below link for other helpful advise on housebreaking.  Hope this helps...|`|b1ae06a1fe2d43f0d327dad7eaab1ab0aa	My vet gave me this info. Take your dog out alot. And always ask him if he has to do his pee, make it sound exciting. And take him out when he goes praise him like crazy. dogs just want to please us. If he does do a pee or poo in the house take him to it and tell him no. do not yell. clean it up with a paper towel take it outside and let him sniff it and tell him good. Always take him to the same door. Even if you go for a walk or ride in the car always use the same door. That way he learns thats where to go to get outside. You didn't say how old your dog was but puppies don't get control of there bladders until about 4 to 5 months old. Good luck to you and your dog|`|nEpz553Jaa	well i had the same problem with my dog but now he is trained..what i did is i got him a cage and i put him in there while i am school the 1st week he pooped and peed in it but he didnt like it so sooner or later he isnt going to do it in there and he is eventually going to have to go outside|`|Ws8y7KC7aa	i think kennel training is best.
sOPNPhIeaa	Ive had mine for a few months now and Im about to cancel the policy and here is why: I got my male shih tzu neutered (at the time he was 7mths and weighed 10.2lbs) and with 1 over night stay with the vet the total cost was US $292.00 and VPI gave me US $85.00 and the representative had the nerve to told me that I had an expensive vet and should have seeked out a lower costing procedure elsewhere, which in my opinion was not right for her to say  becuase it wasnt the procedure that was expensive, it was the anesthesia (which was $150.00 alone while the acutal procedure was only $75.00 the rest was the 20.00 over night charge and pain and antibiotic medicines). She also told me that they only cover the cost of the procedure and not the anesthesia and I asked her well how did they expect the vet to preform an operation without anesthesia? Of course she didnt have an answer for me.<br>  <br>  Basically, I am currently paying about $30 dollars a month for a policy that didnt even reimburse me at least half of the cost of such a major operation and the only thing that stops me from canceling it all together is the fear that that is when an accident will happen but judging from the neutering experience the insurance policy wont cover the costs anyhow.|`|IWBK6VBdaa	They sell insurance for pets|`|16gsWinwaa	get petcare... go to www.petco.com and sign up with their insurance. Its the best. My dog has it. He almost died 4 yrs ago, and I wish I had it then. My vet reccommended me to it, and now Im happy that he has it. They cover everything.
BdWA2soaaa	Hi, I need to ask you two questions. How old is your parrot and is it male or female. Birds at different times start to do mating acts. it depends on the breed and age.

wCAGlE46aa	No he should not be clipped , their coat acts as a weather deterrent believe it or not ... would just try to let him get somewhere cool like the kitchen floor........ could you not get a fan or something also if you get a good stiff brush and comb and take him outside you will get all the dense hair from underneath which will thin it out for him and make him less hot ... seriously dont clip him|`|0xJZJggVaa	Dogs don't sweat. They regulate heat by panting. Shaving really won't help. If it's cooler downstairs in the basement, let him stay there.|`|osrqpU2Taa	Hmmm, usually it's not the heat or fur that is bothersome to dog skin, even the hairiest & thickest coated ones, in fact it's often an insulator against heat & cold...so I would check with a VET to see if there are any underlying skin conditions & if possible comb & brush the dogs regularly which helps against fleas, removing dead skin cells & fur...some dogs are so thick fur coated it's impossible to comb them down deep ! But some ppl do shave their dogs shaved when all else fails, am not sure it's a good idea to mess with Nature tho, their fur is usually their for a reason ! I gotta admit am not sure what a seior GSD is tho ..LOL !! The advice is pretty general for dogs & cats tho :)|`|2FS3ITyvaa	Clipping his coat could actually make him hotter.  A GSD's coat is like a rainforest canopy (at least that's how I explain it to my clients and in my lectures).  It shades the skin from the sun, therefore helping to keep the dog cooler at skin level.  The best option is to be sure all his dead undercoat is removed through good brushing, combing and carding (you may want to ask your groomer if they offer this option ... most do).  That way, the guard hairs (the longer, more hard and shiny hair all over your dog) can do their job of protecting the skin and shading it, but the insulatory undercoat is gone, allowing more air flow to reach the skin.<br>  You can opt to give him a good bath, brushing, and carding AND clipper just his belly hair short.  Dogs cool down through panting and what is called "contact cooling".  If you've ever seen a hot dog sprawled out, belly down, on a cool floor you know what I mean.  Their bellies touching the cool surface (hardwood floor, concrete, tile, etc) cools them down a bit.  <br>  Good luck!|`|9f45d315b28f6dcd8dbae77884fbe041aa	yes clipping you dog would help alot!!|`|mv3wrz5Kaa	Try getting a thinning comb from your local pet shop it will get rid of dense dead hair.|`|yagKnasRaa	Well I am a groomer and i tend to do alot of belly clipping in the summer with large hairy dogs, It seems to help with the heat.

e633b5df729675526c8f91e5886447f7aa	Jack Russell's can be prone to dog/dog aggression.  Additionally, sometimes dogs will tend to attack the weakest link, and this 13 year old might just look like that to your dog.<br>  <br>  It is entirely possible that there is an underlying health issue, such as thyroid, that has contributed to this behavior.  I suggest that you take your dog to the vet for a complete health screening.  If there is a health issue at the root of this sudden aggression, then all the training and behavior modification will prove fruitless unless and until the health issue is under control.<br>  <br>  Here are some good links on the subject:<br>  <a href="http://www.gdhfa.org/ThyroidLaBrie.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gdhfa.org/ThyroidLaBrie.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cah.com/dr_library/hypothyroiddogs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cah.com/dr_library/hypothyroi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.itsfortheanimals.com/DODDS-BEHV-THYROID.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.itsfortheanimals.com/DODDS-BE...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.itsfortheanimals.com/DODDS-CANINE-AI-THYROID.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.itsfortheanimals.com/DODDS-CA...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.k9aggression.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9aggression.com/</a><br>  <br>  That said, it is your responsibility to have control of your dog at all times.  If your dog decided to go after an unknown dog, it would be you the lawsuit would be directed at.  So if you do not have control of your dog, you definitely need to start obedience training.  Visit www.trulydogfriendly.com to find a trainer near you.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you cannot expect the other dogs to tolerate your dog's behavior.  If you cannot keep her crated, purchase a good basket muzzle and acclimate her to it so she can be out of the crate and prevent her from biting the other dogs.  Visit www.petexpertise.com and purchase the Jafco basket muzzle.  This muzzle is not a long-term solution, though, because it will not stop her from attempting to attack them ... and the more she attacks, the more she will want to attack in order to dominate the dog.  And then you have a real mess to deal with.<br>  <br>  You need the vet visit, the training, and the muzzle to get this under control.  Good luck!|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Jack russells are generally a rather aggressive breed.  You have a female and the 13 year old maltese is also a female.  That's why they're not getting along.  Obedience would surely be of benefit to your dog - and socialization - but for the future.  This maltese needs to be protected from your dog right now.  A 13 year old maltese can't be expected to fight off a jack russell in her own house.  For everyone's safety, do the right thing and crate your dog.|`|0xJZJggVaa	Hopefully everything is spayed and neutered?  Your dog needs to be crated when the other dogs are around. It's jealousy.

He was around my sisters Pomeranian for years, one day he attacked and killed him.I just got a new puppy and he kept biting her. I spoke with the vet .

Just love him.|`|ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	The best thing to do is to keep your dog on a leash in the house, use a short nylon lead and a correction chain.<br>  When your dog is agressive toward the other dogs give her a sharp tug on the leash with a firm NO! <br>  I don't believe it's medical, its just dominant behavior...Don't let your dog get away with any agressive behavior toward the other dogs. You have to watch her.  If you can't, then put her in a crate when you cannot keep a close watch on her.|`|4ypOaT3Taa	It sounds like dominance aggression. It may have been the way they met and the way they were raised also plays a part in this scheme. Has the maltese been properly socialized in its life? There could be a miscommunication in the dogs or the maltese could be trying to take position of pack leader. Assert yourself as pack leader. The Dog Whisperer can give you some ideas to help restore order.|`|FovkOo0Faa	Keep your dog crated or on a leash so you can control her at all times.  Have the owners of the maltese have it checked by a vet.  It is possible that it is ill and your dog is sensing it.

zMJmHyuAaa	Yes it is true a duck will lay eggs during the spring of the year whether there is a male around or not.A duck can be kept completely isolated and when spring comes generally beginning in March or April she will begin laying eggs.Laying and egg has nothing to do with the male bird.All he doe's is fertilize what she is already going to lay.The same applies to chickens and most all birds.|`|b4f0862215917ed0cef6e41e52eccc8aaa	i've heard that about chickens too|`|258c563e8aca956a45e3da648b87079aaa	A duck's eggs are just like the eggs produced by a woman's ovaries...I don't need a man to have the eggs, but I do need a man if I want them fertalized.

You just made me laugh--Thanks! :)|`|AA11909406	Female birds do not need a male around to lay eggs. However those eggs will remain just that: eggs. They will not develop and hatch into a chick unless the egg is fertilized by male.
jVyAhoI5aa	Vet check is imperative. He needs to be checked for parasites (inside and out), vitamin A deficiency and bacterial infections. If his beak is affected (or even if it isn't), he may also have to be checked for psittacine beak and feather disease.  If he comes back clear of everything, then gradual conversion to a good diet, lots of showering or baths and TLC is in order. <br>  <br>  It's too bad he was so neglected.  Cockatoos scream for attention but also just love to scream, especially in early morning  and just before bedtime. It's their way of saying that they are cockatoos and they are GREAT! <br>  <br>  Good luck with this new baby! If he comes through, he will be a GREAT bird!|`|AA11909406	I love people like you!!<br>  <br>  You got some great advice already. Proper food, hygiene, vet care, safe/fun toys, proper size cage, out-of-cage play/exercise, lots of TLC and a molt or 2 should do the trick.<br>  <br>  Some of apparent feather loss maybe due to having his wings clipped. Although from the sound of how they cared for this poor guy, I doubt it.<br>  <br>  Once he gets a clean bill of health from the vet, try introducing him to the shower. I use a shower curtain rod so my girl has enough room to get out of the spray if she wants. Use lukewarm water with a soft stream and don't let him get chilled afterword. My U2 (and my B+G) love shower time.<br>  <br>  Also curious..... was the black on his face just his beak or was the poor guy that filthy?  U2s do have black beaks, but can appear gray or dirty white due to a buildup of the dust they naturally create.|`|AA12260782	I think your right.<br>  <br>  Good diet, and some TLC is all he needs.<br>  <br>  Sunflowers seeds are candy to cockatoos.  Imagine eating nothing but chocolate all the time.  You'd feel pretty sick, get cranky and start to look sort of bad.<br>  <br>  Masuri and Zupreem are good.  Also, check feed stores in your area.  Sometimes the best feeds aren't nationally available.<br>  <br>  Remember they need fresh food too.  Offer fruit, vegetables, rice, pasta and some love oatmeal. (NOT instant, the kind you have to cook on the stove)<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope he comes around.|`|SszbjMtLaa	take him to a vet they can check him out and see if he has things wrong with him that you cannot detect|`|gV9ABqA1aa	I suspect that you don't have just one feather problem going on, you probably have a combination of feather problems - stress bars, and plucking at least.  Stress bars can manifest from being fed an improper diet, or having a bacterial or viral infection, usually.  Plucking, of course, is generally a habit developed from psychological stress and boredom, and neglected cockatoos are notorious for it.  Feather condition is a good clue as to the overall health of the bird and from your description, it sounds like this guy is not in good shape.  I'd take him to an avian vet immediately, if he had food growing in his food dish he may very well have a bacterial infection (moldy food and bad water are the major culprits here), and hopefully that's all he has.  Once he gets on a proper, healthy diet and isn't ill, his feathers should come back pretty on the next moult, but getting him to a healthy state may take quite awhile depending on what the vet visit uncovers.  Hopefully, he hasn't been plucking himself, because getting them to stop once they've made it a habit can be next to impossible.  This poor, poor baby.  I'm so glad you have him now.  Good luck!|`|gCklgGBqaa	i think it better to get him to a vet immediately if u really love him enough.. i happen to have a white parrot before.. a few years ago... he got molting problems too although he look totally strong and healthy... he is very playful and always full of tricks.. we love him dearly.. but just before he die he scream everyday.. we thought he just change his behavior that's all no big deal..and by the time we sent it to the vet it already too late .. till now i still feel hurt to think of his scream..<br>  it better to confirmed by the vet that he is healthy before thinking of a way to help him adjust to new environments..<br>  although a proper diet and clean environments is necessary for all pets to stay healthy...please make sure a little spry or mist of water everyday till about half a year sure help him to grow feather.. and make sure u don't spry too much water on him because he don't have enough feather to keep him warm.. u might kill him.. and make sure u change his poo, drinking water and food everyday too. I'm sure he need your care and love dearly.. best of luck.
NUYMlrTGaa	It's possible, but keep in mind Flower Horn Cichlids are interbreed for certain features (like the black markings down their sides often resembling tattoos Oriental lettering). While most male Cichlids display humps the cross-breeding can bring about unexpected results. Also consider that the larger hump is a desirable feature so the development of a hump may still come even if the fish is a female.<br>  <br>  Here is a better way to tell:<br>  <br>  "Generally, it will be easier to tell the sex of the fish when it reaches 4 inches in length. At this size, most female flower horn fish should be able to start laying eggs. The most accurate option to determine the sex of this fish is by looking at the anal pore of the fish. The male fish will have a V-shaped anal pore as compared to the female which has a U-shaped anal pore. Additionally, most female do not have a protruding nuchal hump. The body will tend to look smaller as compared to a male which have a fuller and wider body."|`|AA10237196	6 inches is still too early to establish the fact on whether your fish is a male or a female. Are you keeping it in proper temperature with a heater ? Fh's need between 26 to 28 degree C for their optimum growth.<br>  <br>  Even feeding plays an important role in the signs of the hump. Try to feed Fh pellets and other hikari pellets that are specifically for the fh and growth of its hump as well as colors.<br>  <br>  Wait till the fish grows another inch or so.|`|aPoK3ox4aa	If your Flower horn cichlid does not have a hump it is probably a female, but it is possible the flower horn has been bred to not have a hump or have an extremely small one. The most sure way to find out what your flower horns gender is, is to look underneath and see the little tube. If the tube is a V shape it is a male and if the tube is a very rounded U shape it is a female. Also note the male will be more aggressive then the female and most of the time larger and thicker|`|diOzABpcaa	is the ventral fin pointy or rounded? <br>  Pointy = male<br>  rounded = female<br>  Males typically develope their hump when they are a bit bigger
1nejJ6bVaa	I've seen a parrot fish ruthlessly kill anything, including bottom feeders, that was put into his tank.  They can be very, very agressive. They're not a natural fish, they're crossed by people, and they're a frankenfish.  They will have problems with jaw deformation, tumors, swim bladder problems, extreme aggression, and seem very prone to parasites. As to the aggression, they're a cross of red devils, one of the most mean fish you can get, and gold severums, which are semi aggressive. What you end up with is a huge, mean bully of a fish.  I advocate against buying them. Do some research, and I'm sure you'll agree.|`|145211875f5adee8a13423ca577fcb7caa	They are not too aggressive, but they will survive in a tank with aggressive fish.  We put our parrot fish in a tank with aggressive fish & had no problem.|`|1516a80e3dd57236bef9a1657d1fc5b9aa	They can be, but they are too slow and have no teeth so they can't do much damage other than scaring your other fish.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	I have a few of them, and it just depends on their personality-like any other fish.  I've heard of aggressive mollies and goldfish killing off other fish in the tank....Some are timid some are aggressive.  Mine are all pretty typical of cichlids, they can be territorial if they want to.  I've had one with an oscar before, and the parrot dominated the tank-but not "meanly" so to say.  And just because they're mouths don't close, doesn't mean they can't bite.  I've gotten bit before, and it hurt-not as bad as my red devil who drew blood lol, but was a good enough pinch to make me yell out a yank my hand away.|`|9th1vQLYaa	it depends on what fish you want to keep them with. the best solution would be american cichlides, because they are cichlides as well, and are of similar agressive nature. african cichlids are more agressive, so they wouldn't be a very good company...|`|NUYMlrTGaa	Parrot fish are a hybrid between a Red Devil and a Severum. So dad (the Red Devil) is highly aggressive and Mum (the Severum) shows little or mild aggressive behavior. So some take after mom and some take after dad. <br>  <br>  They usually fall in the semi-aggressive range and due to their deformed mouth they can't eat anything with moderate size - they do act like bulls a ram things sometimes. <br>  <br>  Here's some fish you might consider putting them with:<br>  <br>  Barbs<br>  Dwarf Cichlids<br>  Giant Danios<br>  Gouramis<br>  <br>  They also get around 6 or so inches so don't put them in anything smaller than a 20 or 30 gallon tank.

I would suggest you look around and ask around for a bristle nose pleco.  They stay smaller and are in many ways more interesting than common plecos.  Yep, they are of course a bit more, but really not too expensive.  In my area they run about $5 - 7 for small one's.<br>  <br>  I would also STRONGLY recommend you avoid Chinese Algae Eaters.

keTG5eZ3aa	The fact that your bird wants to lay eggs is a good sign, it means that she is healthy, birds that are not cared for or are stressed out will not go into breeding mode, so that's good for starters.  She won't begin to set on them regularly until she has laid a full clutch which could be 4-7 eggs, so she isn't really neglecting them yet.<br>  <br>  Parakeets though, are not like chickens, and laying eggs is hard work for them, so it is best to discourage her from laying any more than she has to.  If you remove the eggs, she will probably just lay more, which will be bad for her.  The best thing to do is to replace the eggs with wooden eggs or white marbles of the same size.  She will sit on them for a long time before she figures out that they are not going to hatch, but it will give her a break between clutches.  You could get her a mate, and raise babies, it's kind of fun. In any case, provide extra calcium for her in the form of crushed egg shell (sterilized), oyster shell, or cuttle bone, to prevent her from running low on calcium, which they will rob from their own bones, if they become deficient.<br>  <br>  By the way, the color of a parakeets feathers does not indicate the sex of the bird.  Males often have larger, more pronounced foreheads than the females, and the white feathers (in your birds case) on the front of the head often extend farther back than on the females.  <br>  <br>  The easiest way to tell them apart is by cere color.  Males have a bluish, sometimes purplish cere, that is smooth and shiny.  The females have a cere that is more crusty looking and can be very wrinkled, ranging in color from a dirty white to brown.  The cere is the part directly above the upper beak, where their nostrils are.<br>  <br>  Males also chortle (wierd little chirping, talking noises), that females don't do.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|Z3xDpedgaa	go with scotts response or do just what you did. but keep track of how many eggs they lay because if they "overlay" they can get sick from thier system being depleaded|`|0lf7MKIQaa	i can not beleive the wrong information that has been given on some of these sites.  <br>  <br>  Do NOT remove any eggs.  This is NOT a sign that she is healthy and ready to breed.   Any bird can calcium dump an egg.   Just because a female laid eggs, don't mean you need to provide a male for her.  Birds are quiet comfortable with a human companion.  Remember that's why you bought just one!!!    <br>  <br>  History lesson here, Human Females release an egg every month don't they???   Birds are about the same way, except they don't release them until something spawns them to release an egg.  Whether it's a mirror (reflection of themself) or close to a window in the spring time (outside birds nesting), a happy hut(nest box), either way something spawns them to start laying eggs.  Never ever remove the eggs from the female, no matter where she lays them.  Never allow her out of her cage at this time either.  She must sit with her eggs during this time as a way of saying, lay, you stay!!!<br>  <br>  Do NOT promote egg laying, as to say, do NOT put on a box or add a mate.  It might be a once and done thing.  It might be a good time to move the cage at this time to a darker room, or move the cage away from a window in the spring and fall times.  <br>  <br>   It will take about 18 days for the female to realize the eggs will not hatch.  She will abandon the eggs on her own.  When she does that, remove the eggs, clean the cage and return to normal activities.  When I say, clean the cage, i mean during this time, don't mess with her, because she will be nasty as hell.  She is protecting her home and what she thinks are her kids.  Just leave her be.  <br>  <br>  After you remove the eggs, things will go back to normal and she will be ok. Her Cere will go back to the orginal color if the diet is not seeds.   You will know if she is going to lay if the Cere starts turning crusty brown again.   Which then you can avoid the laying process, by placing her cage away from windows.  The object is to avoid Yold pertonitisis, which is absorbtion of the egg.  Birds will not live through that.  So please do not add a mate, or remove eggs.|`|NUYMlrTGaa	Well first off I'll tell ya how to really sex parakeets. Look right above their beak you'll see a colored 'nose' called a cirus. Boys carry a blue/purple cirus females have a red/brown cirus.<br>  <br>  As for the eggs, you're probably better off letting her kick them out herself birds usually know when eggs aren't fertile. If they start stinking or getting moldy throw them out but until then its probably less stress if she decides they're not good.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and you might consider getting her a male.|`|dNm1S3mXaa	Don't put a nest box up,If you do remove it.Leave the egg in there with her until she leaves the eggs its 21 day then throw them out.But if she left them all ready throw them away.As for a girl its not the color of the bird its the nose part were her nose holes are on how you tell if its a girl.On a girl it will be whitish pink but when they get older it turnes brown.On a boy nose its dark blue or dark purple.I think your vet was talking about the nose part.|`|t56MbN83aa	Very small omelet.
jjAn44zwaa	There are many snails for saltwater and the choice is mainly up to you.  I don't recommend margarita snails as they are a colder water species of turbo snails and don't last long in warmer water.  They also need calcium levels of 350-450 to maintain and grow their shells.  The regular turbo snail is warmer water but does need the calcium levels for it's shell.<br>  <br>  Astraea, Nassarius, and Trochus snails are all very good additions as well. Astraea do have an issue that if they get knocked upside down they can't right themselves and then die.  <br>  <br>  Along with the snails a few scarlet legged, blue leg, or left handed zebra hermits would also be good additions for a cleanup crew.|`|44fc65e5ac40e0573065800b92972bdaaa	There are lots of different approachs when setting up a tank and a reef tank can be a true thing of beauty if done correctly.

I have had two frogs about 2 weeks now.  One was half the size of the other.  They were extremely shy and stayed under the rocks unless coming to the surface to eat.  Yesterday I couldn't find the small one.  When I changed the water today I emptied all rocks out and did not find the small frog.  The big frog was "somewhat" bigger I thought.  I'm hoping the big one didn't eat the small one, but I haven't found any trace of the small one having jumped free of the bowl and flopping on the floor anywhere.  I too would like to know for sure.  I sure feel bad for little hoppy, whatever happened to him.|`|NUYMlrTGaa	I'm assuming you're talking about water frogs? If so as long as they're the same size and in the appropriate size tank it should be fine. I'd do 5-10 gallons of water per a frog.
PBBdapCWaa	The only two options are removing a few or getting a much, much larger tank.  Angels are territorial and will fight when cramped for space.  A 55 might hold 5-6 adults until they pairs off to breed, them it would hold the breeding pair and probably no more.  They only become aggressive as they get to adult age and size, that's why you noticed no such activity in the store.<br>  <br>  MM|`|NUYMlrTGaa	As MM pointed out you've sorely overcrowded the tank.

It is very normal for them to behave this way with each other and sometimes another species.  I do not think you could do too much about this problem... possibly add hide out areas to the tank.|`|q8hBKyhhaa	Ok, you have two options for the mature snappy angelfish you own.<br>  <br>  Get a larger tank (which is actually more effective)<br>  or have additional plants and other forms of hiding places.<br>  <br>  The latter would reduce the chance of an angelfish meeting up with his other belligerent tankmates and resulting in an unnecessary battle involving fins and lips. (territory buliding)<br>  <br>  With a larger tank however, they could also avoid such contact.<br>  <br>  It is up to your personal decision, if you are able to afford to fork out a little more cash, do consider a larger tank as the better alternative as it gives your fish the ample space for growth and proper finnage development while also evading ''face-offs''.
AA11618088	There are several issues here.  <br>  <br>  First, your pup was pulled from her mom far too young.  This could be part of the issue - the mom and siblings never got the chance to teach her boundaries.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, your expectations are a little high for her.  Puppies are frequently mouthy.  Some more than others.  This propensity, on TOP of being away from her mom too young, could be part of this.  It may just take her time and gentle correction to outgrow this.  It's not a "you're the boss" issue - it's a growing up issue that you may not be able to 'train' out of her without proper help. <br>  <br>  Thirdly, your techniques are all over the place.  Because this is a natural issue and because of the dog's history, your techinques seem to be severe and bordering on abusive.  Hitting a dog is NEVER acceptable (no matter how euphemistically you label it as "tapping") and can make the issue worse.  Alpha Rolls?  Yelping?  One is a terrible techinique in general and the other teaches the dog that it can hurt you, therefore enforcing the dog's dominance.  Crating her?  Crate are supposed to be dens, NOT penalty boxes.  This is completely inappropriate use of a crate.  <br>  <br>  You are probably going to have to retrain yourself for this pup.  No playing that involves the hands.  If SHE brings your hands into play, say "no" and provide her with another toy that is acceptable.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but I think you need the help of a real trainer.  One who uses positive reinforcement and who is familiar with the breed of dog that you have.  Right now, you are using a bunch of anecdotal training techinques and bad training techiniques that may be adding to the problem.  You need to have someone help you get ONE game plan and stick with it.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your pup.  : )|`|AA10177980	When puppies play with each other, they use their mouths. Therefore, puppies usually want to bite or "mouth" hands during play or when being petted. With puppies, this is rarely aggressive behavior in which the intent is to do harm. Because puppies are highly motivated to exhibit this type of behavior, attempts to suppress it or stop it are unlikely to be successful unless you give your puppy an alternative behavior. The goals of working with this normal puppy behavior are to redirect your puppy's desire to put something in her mouth onto acceptable chew toys and to teach her to be gentle when a hand is in her mouth. <br>  <br>  Encourage Acceptable Behavior<br>  Redirect your puppy's chewing onto acceptable objects by offering her a small rawhide chew bone or other type of chew toy whenever you pet her. This technique can be especially effective when children want to pet her. As you or the child reach out to scratch her behind the ears (not over the head) with one hand, offer the chew bone with the other. This will not only help your puppy learn that people and petting are wonderful, but will also keep her mouth busy while she's being petted. Alternate which hand does the petting and which one has the chew bone. At first, you may need to pet or scratch your puppy for short periods of time, since the longer she's petted, the more likely she is to get excited and start to nip. <br>  <br>  Discourage Unacceptable Behavior<br>  You must also teach your puppy to be gentle with hands, and that nipping results in unpleasant consequences for her. Teach your puppy that nipping "turns off" any attention and social interaction with you. After a nip, look your puppy right in the eye, and yell "OUCH" as though you've been mortally wounded, then ignore her. Leave the room if you must, but ignore her until she's calm, then try the chew bone and petting method again. It's even better if you can coax your puppy into a sitting position using food. It may take many repetitions for her to understand what's expected. <br>  Nipping and mouthing hands can also be discouraged by loosely holding your puppy's lower jaw between your thumb and forefinger after she's taken your hand in her mouth. Don't hurt her by squeezing too hard, just gently hang on so that wherever her mouth goes, your hand hangs on. This will quickly become tiresome and she'll eventually pull away. After several seconds, release her jaw, but continue to offer her your hand. If she licks or ignores it, praise, pet and offer a tidbit. If she closes her mouth on your hand again, repeat the procedure. <br>  A third alternative is to wear cotton gloves coated with a substance with an unpleasant taste such as "Bitter Apple." In this way, your puppy will learn that "hands in mouth taste bad." For this method to work, every time she nips your hand she must experience this bad taste. The possible disadvantage to this method is that your puppy may learn "hands with gloves taste bad and those without gloves don't. <br>  Remember that any of these three methods will probably not be effective unless you work hard to teach your puppy the right behavior by offering her an acceptable chew toy. <br>  Jumping Up<br>  When your puppy jumps up on you, she wants attention. Whether you push her away, knee her in the chest or step on her hind legs, she's being rewarded for jumping up (even though it's negative attention, she's still getting what she wants). <br>  <br>  When Your Puppy Jumps Up:<br>  Fold your arms in front of you, turn away from her and say "off." <br>  Continue to turn away from her until all four of her feet are on the ground, then quietly praise her and give her a treat. If she knows the "sit" command, give the command when all four of her feet are on the ground, then quietly praise her and give her a treat her while she's in the sitting position. <br>  When you begin to praise her, if she begins to jump up again, simply turn away and repeat step two, above. Remember to keep your praise low-key. <br>  When your puppy realizes that she gets no attention from you while she's jumping up, but does get attention when she stops jumping up and sits, she'll stop jumping up. Remember, once you've taught her to come and sit quietly for attention, you must reward her behavior. Be careful not to ignore her when she comes and sits politely, waiting for your attention. <br>  What Not To Do<br>  Attempts to tap, slap or hit your puppy in the face for nipping or jumping up are almost guaranteed to backfire. Several things may happen, depending on your puppy's temperament and the severity of the correction: <br>  <br>  She could become "hand-shy" and cringe or cower whenever a hand comes toward her face. <br>  She could become afraid of you and refuse to come to you or approach you at all. <br>  She could respond in a defensive manner and attempt to bite you to defend herself. <br>  She could interpret a mild slap as an invitation to play, causing her to become more excited and even more likely to nip. <br>  Never play "tug-of-war" or wrestling games with your puppy if you're having a nipping problem. These types of games encourage out-of-control behavior, grabbing, lunging and competion with you. These aren't behaviors you want her to learn. <br>  <br>  A Note About Children And Puppies<br>  It's very difficult for children under eight or nine years old to practice the kind of behavior modification outlined here. A child's first reaction to being nipped or mouthed by a puppy is to push the puppy away with their hands and arms. This will be interpreted by the puppy as play and will probably cause the puppy to nip and mouth even more. Dogs should never be left alone with children under ten and parents should monitor closely all interactions between their children and dogs.|`|IGZLHR0iaa	Hold her on her back until she stops fighting. When she calms down let her up.<br>  If she continues, repeat. I did this with my Great Dane and she has been such a sweet dog. :)|`|f829cd2980a8f6542837cba465b79f15aa	take her to an obeadint school!!!!!|`|jXm1Ppicaa	well..first of all it's supposed to be trained and while it does cool tricks for you or listens to you then give him/her a treat!|`|ldfE9vNGaa	Puppies learn the correct social behavior from their mom and littermates and it sounds as though she may have left her doggy family a little early and so missed out on some of the finer points! You didn't mention what breed she is (or mix of) and that can have something to do with it as some breeds are much more 'mouthy' than others, the same goes for the dominance issue.<br>  <br>  She definitely sounds as though she's a bit stubborn and probably fairly self-confident and dominant in nature but she may also be confused as to what is acceptable as it sounds as if you've tried several different methods of training in a fairly short time, it'd be better to choose a course of action and stick with it consistently. Puppies learn through repetition and have pretty short attention spans.<br>  <br>  A puppy like this probably won't respond well to physical corrections (never a good idea at the best of times) and if you raise your voice or are combative in your behavior she'll most likely react with defiance. I'd suggest you keep your voice low but firm and always follow through when you tell her "No". Totally withdraw your attention when she nips and bites, avoid eye contact, fold your arms and walk away. reward her immediately if she plays without biting. Never play tug of war or any kind of game where she gets to pit her strength against yours. If she knows 'down' and will do it for you then she does recognize your authority as an extremely dominant puppy will rarely go 'down' without a fight.<br>  <br>  If you use a spray bottle, set it to 'stream' and hit her right on the nose with the jet, spraying her from behind won't help. As far as her chewing on her leash goes, if you've tried bitter apple and that doesn't work, you could try the little breath-freshner sprays as a lot of dogs don't like the taste. If that also fails you could resort to smearing hot sauce on it, or even soaking it overnight in vinegar and letting it air dry.<br>  <br>  Give her plenty of exercise and very strong chew toys so that she can wear herself out a little, a tired puppy is a well-behaved puppy! <br>  <br>  However, taking her to puppy class is highly recommended as they'll be able to help you find the best way to discipline her as well as giving her a chance to learn how to behave around other dogs and puppies which is invaluable. A local Petsmart class can be a good starting point. She's probably a very smart dog and you may find once she's learnt the basics at puppy class that you're ready to go on to obedience classes or agility or whatever.<br>  <br>  Good luck with her, she may seem impossible now but inside there's a great dog just waiting to get out!|`|lD5U9RUMaa	When you are playing with your dog (or having any contact for that matter) and she bites you, immediatley withdraw yourself from the situation. Take your hands away from her, stand upright (if you were hunched over), and do not look at her or speak to her, basically just ignore her. She will realize that her actions do not conjure up a reaction of any sort and she will stop. Good Luck :)

Once she is used to the place and feels comfortable to eat, she'll be hungry and eat.. if you start sucking her up now, you will have a lifetime of a picky eater.|`|S8mfGG6raa	Try to find out what she eat before you adopted her. Or try Bobtail gravy mix. Pour it over the dog food see if she likes it but mix some rice and chicken with the food. If she eats you can make the rice and chicken little in her food|`|32f6f38357f1e7ab6a8d141def7d5116aa	This is going to sound stupid, but I used to  talk and baby my dogs   dog food in  my hand and he would get so jelouse that he would  eat it.You  might be able to do that  for awhile.Also  he might not like that dog food .Try   another type of dog food.|`|39c5d0551a26c143329ca08e575169d9aa	Try to find out what she has been fed, If you can't or don't want to feed it, You have a couple of option, You can feed half of what she use to eat and half regular dog food. to ease the transition, You can say theirs your food if your hungry you will eat, It might take a day or so but believe me she will eat. Take a look into a natural diet, called the "barf" diet, Stand for bones and raw food, <br>    Our yellow lab is on an all raw food diet, She eats chicken necks, backs, mushed veggies, whole fish, ALL RAW, She loves it, and it better for them, Do your research first you will surprised what you find.|`|c1ef2012ade987cc68e939a8065019ebaa	I would gradually wean her off the chicken and rice that you feed her. Just slowly stop adding the chicken and rice to her meal. She was probably fed people food from her previous owners or is just a picky eater, which is not uncommon. I hope this helps some and good luck :)|`|7XH0kdoeaa	My dog is a little like that. She's finicky, very pick about what she eats. Lots of dogs have "expensive taste." Take some ordinary dog food and mix it in with the rice and chicken, and gradually add less and less. I'd keep a bit in there for her own satisfaction, though. (: Lots of over-weight dogs have been fed treats there whole lives, and if your just adopted her, perhaps that's exactly her story. She's not used to this raw, hard dog food. She wants treats, perhaps. I'd just wean her off slowly. This method could also help the weight problem.|`|AA11244961	When one of my family lets my puppy eat food out of our hand, it works pretty well.  Try that!
VpOGcG4maa	It is more then okay!!!|`|t9Fxx75uaa	They're good for him but make them just snacks or supplements cause dogs need MEAT based foods.  Oh and stay away from onions, grapes and raisins and chocolate.|`|2VdJgenjaa	why don't you just steam them if you're worried about choking. That way they still get to chew them.|`|6efb1915453e10ba302a119e6d5cbf7baa	Oh yeah!  My puppy loves carrots, celery, and all sorts of veggies, for treats!  Stay away from onions, they are toxic.  Fruits and veggies, in moderation, make a great healthy treat for your dog.  Do make sure that the base of his diet is a good puppy kibble.<br>  <br>  Add:  Sorry, I just re-read about the soft food.  Dry kibble is actually MUCH better for your pup's teeth and gums, and depending on the brand of food it is, it usually has some nutrients that are missing out of the soft food.  Yes, it would be appropriate to mix a little bit of chopped/diced veg into the food, but if you do that, be prepared to be doing it ALL of the time!|`|ShZRWlnuaa	Yes..my vet recommended that I give my doxies carrots, celery, or raw green beans instead of other treats since they both needed to maintain trim figures...she said it also helped provide good fiber to keep their anal glands drained.  They love them and it really has kept them trim.  If it is a puppy I would just see how well he is able to chew...you might see if he likes them steamed a little...or pureed would be fine too. Apple is fine too if you dog can afford the calories...I do know that they are not supposed to have onions, grapes or raisins--and if you have kids make sure they don't let the dog grab chocolate away from them...|`|kJ7gZwxqaa	Yes<br>  Avoid onions, grapes, apple seeds and chocolate though!!<br>  <br>  Frozen peas and carrots are the best for them plus it feels great when they are teething!!<br>  <br>  I have a 7 month old lab and he loves them. He would rather eat salad then dog food and dog treats!!|`|LzBJo0zdaa	My dog loves carrots and other veggies<br>  I checked with the vet and he said it was healthy<br>  They actually put some veggies in some brands of diet dog food.|`|SUCC88EJaa	He can eat them carrots in the large stick form. It actually helps clean the plaque off their teeth, I believe.  I think for some reason larger dogs like them more than small dogs.  My German Shephard devours them, but my Cocker Spaniel won't touch them....<br>  As for the celery, I know for humans they have a negative nutritional value because it takes more energy to consume them than you get from it, so I would avoid the celery until you can get to the vet and ask him for sure.<br>  And if she does choke, just stick your finger down her throat and fish it out.  As long as she's moving air she should be able to get it though.|`|a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Hey! <br>  To a dog those types of foods can be treats!<br>  I understand your concern over the choking thing! Just keep in mind most dogs know their limits as far as the size of foods goes (although to us it appears they are going to choke!)<br>  I would say continue to give him carrots and celery in reasonable sizes.<br>  My small dogs like many fruits and veggies, cut to small small sizes, of course. <br>  They like apples, green beans, baby carrots, pineapple......the list goes on and on to what they like. I just keep the size  of the pieces appropriate to their size.<br>  But remember onions, chocolate, grapes and raisins are<br>  out.<br>  To make absolutely sure, you can consult with your vet.<br>  Good Luck!
04de94b5ba8f5714fa049aef9b5b132faa	First sorry to hear of the puppies dying.  Parvo is a horrible disease.  I personally would no go.  Parvo can live in it's environment for 9 months to a year easily.<br>  <br>  I have a dog who is current on all of her vaccinations and she is an older dog (1 yr and 1/2) and she got parvo just from being in the environment where our other puppy had it even after we bleached everything including the yard. Don't risk it.<br>  <br>  I am attending Vet Tech School and after a puppy receives their first set of vaccinations it should be every year unless the vet you go to has the 3 year shot.  Some people after their first year of giving a puppy their vaccines choose to do what they call a Titer test.  What this does is test the dog for antibodies.  For example, it will see how many Parvo antibodies your dog has, and if it's high enough they really don't need to be vaccinated again.  It's a bit expensive but some people like that instead of giving them vaccines every year but this is not the case of rabies.  The puppy will still need this vaccine.<br>  <br>  Back to your original question, I would not take your puppy there.  There is a risk and it's not worth it.  Parvo is pretty expensive to cure and that doesn't mean they will make it.  Protect your dog.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|0wKCaNocaa	I had a great Dane die of parvo and my other dog was in the pin with him who had shots and didn't catch it but we sold the dog House after two years and that dog got parvo but had not had its shots our great Dane was supposed to get his shots before we got him but he didn't so be careful about the early shots I breed boxers and I give a shot record signed by the vet to my puppy parents but they told us parvo can live in the dirt two foot down for five years so I wouldn't take any chances please be very careful with that situation|`|Xr15tfDhaa	I am not an expert on parvo, but I would not risk it.|`|ZgooR22Paa	No vaccine is 100%.  When I have to work with dogs with parvo at the clinic, I take my shoes off before I walk through my front door at home and don't let my dog touch me until I change my clothes and wash up a little.  He is almost three years old and is completely vaccinated.  Parvo is nothing to mess around with.  Yours is a puppy, so he is even higher at risk.<br>  <br>  The American Animal Hospital Association recommends the distemper/parvo combo at 8, 12, and 16 wks, then at one year later, then every three years from then on.  Not all clinics have switched to the three year protocol yet, which is why you are getting different answers.  Rabies is a three year vaccine after the first annual vaccine.  Some vaccines, like leptospirosis and lymes are every year still.  Some, like Giardia, are no longer recommended.  You can get the entire list of vaccines from www.ahaanet.org.  Some vaccines are localized however- for example, if you don't live in an area with a lot of ticks, you probably wouldn't need lymes vaccine.<br>  <br>  I would suggest finding a clinic that does the three year vaccination schedule for distemper/parvo, because it means they follow recommendations and are up to date.<br>  <br>  <br>  On another note, if your puppy is only 14 wks old (3 1/2 months), he needs another shot at 16 wks.  He started his vaccinations too early (before 6 wks) if he had four shots of it and they wont be effective.  The reason is because puppies get all the antibodies they need from their mom until 8 wks (some people start vaccinating at 6 wks, but it's not recommended).  Until they are 16 wks old, they still have some of the mom's antibodies in them, and the vaccines may not stimulate the immune system enough.<br>  <br>  I don't know who told you to vaccinate an extra time, but it is worthless to overvaccinate.  Exposing the immune system to something it already has antibodies to will NOT make the immune system any stronger.  This is why the distemper/parvo combo is now a three year vaccine- we found that dogs had good titers for it for at least three years or more, and overvaccinating does nothing for the dog.  Giving an extra puppy shot wont hurt the puppy, but I'm just letting you know that it might not help him either.<br>  <br>  Case in point- a rottie owner (another breed prone to the disease) was told to vaccinate every month until the dog was a year old.  The dog came into our clinic with parvo, and the vet was appalled that the breeder told the owner to overvaccinate that much.  That dog got parvo because the vaccines they were using came from "Quality Farm and Fleet" and were not refrigerated correctly.  Only get vaccines from your vet.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So, short answer to your question- no, do not go to a parvo hotbed with your puppy especially...but don't even go without her and then come back to her.  You could carry some of the virus on you/your clothing/your pillow, etc, and infect her.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ******EDIT********<br>  <br>  The exact AAHA website is:<br>  <a href="http://www.aahanet.org/PublicDocuments/VaccineGuidelines06Revised.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aahanet.org/PublicDocuments/V...</a>|`|pFpI4qMmaa	I would strongly recommend NOT TAKING this puppy anywhere near the area where other dogs have had parvo.  Parvo is VERY contagious and often times the bleach/water doesn't get it all.  Even if your puppy is fully vaccinated against Parvo,  there is still a small chance that they can get it.<br>  <br>  As far as vaccinations, here is our clinic policy:<br>  8 weeks of age: 1st DHPP and deworm<br>  11-12 weeks of age: 2nd DHIPP and deworm<br>  14-15 weeks of age: Final DHPP and Rabies<br>  <br>  Your vet may recommend one more additional DHPP, especially when you have a dog who's litter mate or neighbor has had parvo. When the dog gets the final DHPP and Rabies, this is good for 1 year. So 1 year later you bring the dog back and they can do a 3 year Rabies and DHPP.  You will have to check with your vet as the 3 yr rabies isn't available in all states.  I feel it is  crucial to get the dog vaccinated when it's due but you have to make your own decision.  Contrary to popular beliefs, even an older dog can get parvo or distemper.<br>  <br>  By the way DHPP=(distemper, hepatitis, parvo and para-influenza)  Just in case this was a question|`|qeGZNOlEaa	If your dog has had all his parvo boosters, he should be fine. I don't see how waiting a year would help with your fiance's parents parvo situation- parvo is very hardy and can stay in the soil forever.  Your best bet is to call your vet, and ask their opinion. <br>  I work at a vet clinic, and it's recommended to give shots every year, except rabies, which the first is good for one year, then they can usually get a rabies vaccine that is good for 3 years. Yes, sometimes dogs can be okay going a little longer than a year. You can have titers checked to see if your dog is still immune, but, at least where I work, it's cheaper to just get the vaccine. I know my boss often only gives distemper every other year once the dog gets to be around 10 years old. We see a lot of dogs get parvo that have had vaccines in the past, but people don't keep them current.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	The very best person to ask is your vet.  He can advise you as to how protected your pup will be.  Personally I wouldn't go near her home with a pup of any breed.<br>  Not even to visit.  You can bring the Parvo virus home with you on your shoes too.  <br>  <br>  I just wouldn't be willing to take a chance.  Just my opinion.|`|AA12363322	If it were my puppy I wouldnt even take the chance even if she has the shots.  vaccines are not guarantees!!!!  As far as shots every year, me personally, dont like over vaccinating my dogs.  Parvo is a mainly a puppy disease and most dogs over the age of 4 months dont get it, but to be safe I would say a year.  So I prefer not to vaccinate parvo every year past puppy hood, unless the dog is in a high risk area.<br>  Oh yeah and it is true that parvo can live in the soil for over a year.  I live in Alaska and A iditerod dog lot had parvo in the soil and lost every puppy under the age of 4 months.   None of the adult dogs were affected.
pSJj1zSoaa	huh?|`|Qyf5C1M2aa	Yes they do., All livebearers do, Guppie,swordtail,platie,mollie.|`|YfDWvMuhaa	yes, so the best thing to do to insure that the fry will survive is buy a net breeder or plastic breeder compartment. however, if you can't do that, separating the molly into an entirely different tank all together with plants and gravel for hiding is second best as the other fishes in your main tank will also eat the fry. after the molly gives birth to all her fry (up to 30) move her back into the main tank and keep the separate tank with the fry as a baby tank. also make your mother molly is comfortable for more and healthy fry before she gives birth. <br>  here are some factors that will help the mother prepare for birth:<br>  *Large tank (10-15 gallons at LEAST)<br>  *Warm water (80 degrees) <br>  *Brine shrimp, blood worms, live foods <br>  *Salt (about 1 tablespoon per 5 gallons)   <br>  <br>  (also after the fry are born, feed them crushed flakes and try putting little cut pieces of blood worms and brine shrimp in the baby's tank after week or two. if they can eat it, feed them that as it is full of protein to help them grow, but if you can't crushed flakes are fine.)<br>  <br>  (also mollies give birth about 3 times with about 8 weeks in between each delivery, so continues to do the preparation factors i listed above and then separate the mother molly again in 7 weeks if she still looks pregnant.)|`|d84b03804cab833afdfbb991099703b0aa	Yes, balloon mollies along with many other live bearers including guppies and platies do eat there own fry. If you want them to survive you can by a breedind trap which is basicly a plastic box that hangs inside the tank. inside the box is a V shaped piece of plastic that divideds the box top and bottom. at the bottom of the V is a small slit that allows the fry once born to swim down to the bottom of the box and out of the mothers mouth. wen you see fry wait a day so you can make sure all of the fry have been born. then release the mother back into the tank. then once the fy get to be about a half of an inch long they will be to big to be eaten and should fare well with the parents.|`|k3wtISyraa	yes they will so give the fry a lot of hiding spaces and keep the mother well fed some people use breding nets but I like to let nature take its course they will hide and in no time they will be to big for momma to eat|`|Bq7hQduPaa	yes,you have a livebearer the eat there fry so seperate the mom when the fry is laid.good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  ILF|`|AA11408001	Yes.If you can't put them in a separate tank.Put plant or and a <br>  pile of stones where the fry can only get into.They can have a lot.<br>  My first had 38.They we're the ones who survived.

GIlxrv7Gaa	No. Chihuauas are the only breed that ar born with the inability to regulate their own body temperature. He may have a muscle disease or could just be a very nervous dog. There are many dogs that are just like we are and act that way.<br>  Does he ACT like a normal dog? Does he act scared, typically run, constantly have 'wide eyes', or does he play and run like a normal dog would? Watch the rest of his behavior. If it doesn't affect him any other way (doesnt have diarrhea, defecates and urinates normally, well muscled, good apetite, etc) then I wouldn't worry about it, unless adverse symptoms begin to occur,. GOOD LUCK|`|HG5ZNvwMaa	the shaking could be she's sick from cold drafts or seizuring and is having nuerological problems.  you should ask your vet. does she act normal-like all vets say "we need to know what's abnormal b4 we can say it's normal" so in other words does she do anything that u notice that she doesn't do on a regular basis.  does she act like a "normal" dog-eating well, defecating when needs to, energetic and alert..etc.?|`|fVjk5STvaa	Have your dogs thyroid checked.

S4dxECPIaa	I would recommend you read all the information you can find on the breed.  Ask your vet what they think.  Go to a few dog shows and talk to the people there that have them.<br>  They are a high maintenance breed because of the huge amount of health problems.  I know a breeder of English Bulldogs that will tell potential owners they must have a lot of money in the bank for vet bills.  Bulldog puppies are also high priced because they must always be born c-section.  <br>  The ones I've known have been very people friendly, but all were dog aggressive.  I think that is pretty normal, so they should be socialized with other dogs as much as possible and at an early age.|`|Sh6u3qfAaa	They are sweet and gentle with people, but it is very important to socialize them as puppies with lots of people, and with lots and lots of dogs. If they are not socialized, they will be aggressive.|`|a5BJjZVsaa	they are great dogs but have a lot of medical problems such as breathing problems and skin problems|`|39kZIT9Baa	Below are some sites I found on a quick search.<br>  <br>  When looking for a puppy becareful. There have been a few scams going around where people say that the bulldog is out of the country and you can save it if you send them money.<br>  <br>  To be on the safe side, visit any breeder that you wish to purchase from. Most good breeders won't ship the dog unless they have met you anyway. <br>  <br>  Also spend some time around one. They are cute but they have that pushed in face and make a lot of noise when they breath.

AA10387487	Ferrets are frequent scratchers by nature, but excessive scratching is a problem. Try the following link for some good advice about potential issues and how to resolve them: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?articleid=552" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a>|`|DYtBxlAGaa	My ferrets (5) have a similar problem.  I bathe them less often (every 2 months) and sometimes I use a conditioner spray for ferrets on them, but they still scratch scratch scratch.  I had the vet check them out.  No mites, fleas, lice, parasites... no medical problems that would cause it either.  They are just frequently itchy.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you are watching their bedding in a dye-free/fragrance-free detergent.  <br>  <br>  It might be worthwhile to go ahead and have the vet check them out.  Itchiness can be a sign of adrenal disease, among other things.  Don't fret if the vet can't figure it out either; they might just be itchy critters like mine are.<br>  <br>  ALSO: if you think they have fleas, make sure you ONLY use a flea product marketed specifically for ferrets.  Flea products sold for cats and dogs are absolutely not supposed to be used on ferrets.|`|Md3PnLYHaa	fleas are much too small to see just by looking in their fur, they often jump away when something large is near. i suggest buying them a flea collar and treating them with flea medication once a week for 5-7 weeks. then if they still itch, you can talk to a vet. i also recommend using a vacuum on all fabrics in your home, and treating any other animals for fleas and flea colars/|`|En8VwdFaaa	Ferrets are naturally itchy critters, particularly during coat changes when new hair is coming in, so what you're seeing may not be anything to be concerned about. The one suggestion I would make would be to check their ears. Dirty ears and/or mite infested ears will cause intense itching over the entire body. Ears should be cleaned once weekly to every other week. If mites are present a topical medication such as Otomite Plus (which is what I use, as recommended by my vet) will quickly remedy the problem.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: Flea collars should NEVER be used on ferrets, the reaction to the chemicals could be fatal!!|`|AA12242145	My ferret is the same way, and so were my previous ferrets. When I was younger we used to bathe them in Skin So Soft which is basically baby oil + fragrance and it helped a lot with itching and got rid of any fleas/mites. Give the baby oil a try, they will be fine. I also just bought Pet Relief "Anti-itch spray" at PetSmart which is for dogs and cats but safe for ferrets too, It relieves itching, abrasions, flea bites, allergic dermatitis ect. Good luck.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	There are a few different worms you could be describing.  Leeches come in white but don't move in that "S" shaped slither, they move by stretching themselves, sucking on with their mouth, then scrunching themselves up.  You can just grab these with a large plant tweezers, they die out of water.  Planaria come in several colors (beigish-white is one); many are harmless but some will suck blood.  They move more like snails, often have a small arrow-shaped head, generally eat leftover food and dead plant material, propagate by laying eggs and by subdividing, are harmless to fish (some fish, supposedly, eat them but I've never found a fish that will, not even bettas).  They are hard to get rid of because they are easily dismembers and each segment will grow into a new worm, plus they lay eggs you can't see which will hatch into more worms.  The other worm that it sounds like it could be are nematodes, they look like little whitish (but they also come in darker colors) worm worms, real thin and usually less than 1/4" long, move in that squiggly "S" movement (like a snake), often will wiggle out of the water right above the waterline if you have a lid on the tank (so the air right above the waterline is moist).  These are usually harmless and many young fish eat them (they're good baby fish food), live in plants and sometimes very large snails.  All these worms can be eradicated by sprinkling just a pinch of Panacur (dog and horse deworming medication--comes in powder but also in a liquid (then it's just a couple drops) but don't over medicate).  Panacur will kill the worms but won't hurt fish (even baby fish), plants, snails, shrimp.  However, most vets won't just give you or sell you Panacur; I've bought it online at pet med shops.  I'd try to avoid tearing down your whole tank because you'll lose all your beneficial bacteria and have to cycle all over again.  With the exception of blood sucking leeches (and not all are but you can't tell until one latches onto a fish (or you)), the other worms won't hurt your fish.  I have a feeling yours are nematodes--the ones that come out of hte water you can just wipe off with a papertowel.  Otherwise, once you get more fish in your tank, you probably won't see too many of these worms around and weekly tank cleanings & water changes will keep their numbers in check.|`|ITiD3Yiiaa	Yes, I think I know what you're talking about. My giant catfish's tank had those white hair line worms as well. I had to remove my catfish to another temporary holding area while I sterilized the entire tank and the equipments. There's no way of completely getting rid of these worms unless you clean out EVERYTHING. If you have no sterilizing products at hand, you can clean out the entire area and whatever tank equipments with mildly hot water. Be sure to put your fish in another holding area first. Also, I suggest that if you feed your fish with fish meal products or any meat based products, you need to get a good filtering system or clean the environment pretty often. These pesky worms come about when the meat based food becomes stale and is collected in the tank for a long time. The snails could be gotten rid of easily by removing the java moss. There are chemical solutions and other products that kill off such pests but I don't recommend it as some fish react poorly to it.|`|NUYMlrTGaa	I've been having the same problem - Jungle Brand Parasite Guard temporarily gets rid of them.

ab1qzFRIaa	For the koi they like orange slices with the peel on!  True!  Be sure not to leave in longer than 2 hours or so.  I recommend using a feeding ring to help contain oranges and the fish will learn to come to it.  That way your slices will not float away in your pond.<br>  <br>  Bettas favorite food are blood worms, you can use freeze dried if you are squeamish.<br>  <br>  Bon Apetite!|`|KEYgd73saa	There are small cubes of frozen brineshrimp or bloodworms.

AA11909406	I answered a similar question a few days back.  This is should help you. I modified the answer a bit.<br>  <br>  First you need to watch your bird and learn the signs that he is getting ready to poop. Decide on a verbal command to use when you want him to poop, but be careful about the word/phrase, he will probably add it to him vocabulary. Once you figure this out, wait until he is getting ready to poop and say the command (I use "dirty bird"). After he poops praise him and give him a treat to enforce good behavior. You must be consistent in doing this. <br>  <br>  Once he learns to command the rest is pretty easy. Before you take him out, tell him to poop, wait till he complies then take him out and praise him. <br>  <br>  You should realize as well, little birds like quakers have fast digestive systems. If he is going to be out of his cage for any length of time, occasionally bring him over to a piece of paper near where he hangs out and give the poop command. This is where recognizing the pre-poop signs comes in handy.<br>  <br>  Be patient and consistent and eventually he will learn. Also remember mistakes will happen. If he gets startled, he will probably poop where ever he is. Don't punish him, but let him know that you are not pleased with him|`|3jlyA12Oaa	I don't think you can "potty train" a bird.  I guess that's why they should stay in their cage for the most part and only be out when you can watch them.|`|U4zBw9p7aa	You cant teach em not to. They sometimes dont even know there pooping, however go on Foster and Smith and go to the bird section. They have some parrot diapers.|`|n1WvEZFTaa	All birds poop!!!

When she went potty, I praised her and told her what a good girl she was to go potty.  Then before I would take her out of her cage I would tell her to go potty.  She has only had a couple of mistakes in the 5 years that I have had her.  Just be patient and Good Luck!|`|0303e5a1d1a53dd164c49328744034f5aa	When you have him out of the cage, watch him carefully.  Sometimes they wiggle when they have to go, or they kind of squat and lean forward.  If you can catch him before he poops, bring him quickly to his cage and let him poop there.  Once he does, praise him and reward him.  Make a big thing of it.  If you do this a few times, he will get the idea.  Parrots are really smart.  Good luck.|`|08356dbe1165efc8cdfb152376246d32aa	This is not a dog, it's a bird.<br>  <br>  These birds are scatterers... The will eat fruit and spread the seed.  It's part of their function.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you get a plastic cover for the floor, you can just wipe it off.
lKE7GiHraa	Get a larger tank, at least a 30 for what you have.  Goldfish need a lot of room.  They prefer cold water, and if you have a pleco (algae eater), it wants warmer water.  Most catfish (ones you'll find in a pet shop) are tropical as well.|`|u73CcHtiaa	NO|`|mpIiTBVIaa	Blackmoores are the WRONG pet to get for a tiny 10 gallon! Unless you are into torturing fish, I would return them for mollies, or get a larger tank. When I had a 29 gallon with six goldies I have TONS OF TROUBLE and had to upgrade to a 50 gallon. Blackmoores grow to at least eight inches, and I have heard of them being a footlong. Please give them room to grow, they are so cute and dont deserve a death like that. I know pet stores tell you the wrong stuff. good luck!<br>   PS! dont get a heater for cold goldfish!!! Get a book and readup:)

You have my utter and complete sympathy, a Great Dane puppy in the "teenage phase" is the "puppy from hell", so I know what you're going through!|`|HG5ZNvwMaa	it will last as long as you keep giving up-reward her when she doesn't do it-if she does don't beat her but use proper discipline like a strong command or a swat at her nose-(not hard) just if you let her win she will use it AGAINST you. my dog did the same but after 2 months of training and care and discipline she learned.|`|VkMQHIh8aa	This sounds like a issue you need to bring to her former trainer's attenton.|`|b332e7b57a7027aae9ca67a5966cdf5eaa	someone told me when we had our husky that for at least 3 years they go through that phase of puppyness and rebelion as though they rule the roost and i remember thinking - god no!!!!! but believe me our dog is now nearlly 8 and its only been the last couple of years he has mellowed but he can still have his moments, but on the whole hes quite good but hang in there - all dogs are different so yours may get over the phase quicker than ours ...Think you have to ride it out|`|fjEXbPWDaa	You're right - puppies at about 7 to 8 months of age start to go through a testing stage.  (8 to 10 weeks - 4 months they try new things, 4 months - 6 months they get scared of everything)<br>  <br>  How long it lasts will depend on how you respond.<br>  <br>  If you allow her to continue the unacceptable behaviors without correction, they will continue until you retrain her.<br>  <br>  Go back to step 1 in obedience training.  Work with her on the basics, and do NOT let her ignore your commands.  When she does, just turn your back saying "WRONG!" for a few seconds.  She won't like this lack of attention, because she knows that you have treats!!!!<br>  <br>  You can expect to have to continue working with her for at least 2 weeks before the behavior starts to curb itself.<br>  <br>  Do not let this be an excuse to let her form bad habits because she's insistant on doing the behavior - you must correct her every time at the SAME LEVEL (i.e. don't punish her easily, then move up to harsher punishments as she continues).<br>  <br>  Get a ketchup bottle (like the squeeze bottles used at picnics) and put REALLY cold water in it.  When she jumps up on the counter or the couch, tell her "WRONG!" and squirt her.  It doesn't hurt, but the cold water gets their attention quickly.|`|xuceSTTnaa	Dogs go through the "teenager stage" at different ages. You just have to be patient, and show her that you are not giving up. She is just challenging you, she'll get over it. Hang in there, and don't give up, that's what she wants.

PBBdapCWaa	The fish store doesn't have a clue about proper betta care.  Since your bowls are unfiltered you need to change 100% of the water every 3-4 days.  They don;t like dirty water any more than any other fish... what a silly and harmful remark.  *yeah, I was thinking stuff I can't type ;)   Give them all a good water change and I bet they will perk right back up.  They are probably not sick, just feeling bad due to the foul water conditions.<br>  <br>  I would suggest feeding the bettas twice a day.  On one day give them pellets both times and one the other day give them pellets once and some type of frozen food the other feeding.<br>  <br>  If I can help further feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  MM|`|488823611b3dd130eb3a102a9da58b4caa	ok -- lets try to figure this out -- <br>  <br>  bettas don't like dirty water -- you are right about that.  they would prefer the water temperature of their new water to be the same as the old water so its best to get a bucket and let the water sit for a while so its the same temperature.   <br>  <br>  i am assuming you know not to use soap or anything to wash the bowls.  <br>  <br>  bettas like warm temperatures.  it is hard to regulate temperatures in a bowl.  they would prefer to be over 75 degrees.  temperature seems to be one of the most important factors with bettas.<br>  <br>  there are a few ways to try to get bettas to recognize pellets as food -- you can try rubbing some garlic on them -- just cut the garlic in 1/2 and rub it on the pellet -- it sounds weird but it works sometimes.<br>  i try to make the pellet look like a drowning bug -- push it down in the water and scoot it along the surface until you get the bettas attention.  bettas instincts are to grab live food so if it looks alive it might go for it.<br>  <br>  bettas like stimulation.  mine all do better if you give them a big fabric leafed plant that hits the top of the water or sticks out some.  they use leaves as resting places and will use the part of the plant at the top of the water to anchor nests.  caves, castles and other hiding spots work sometimes too.  different bettas have different preferences.<br>  i look at it this way -- you wouldn't want to be locked in a room with nothing in it -- decorate for your little buddy.  the more the better -- i don't know where the idea of minimal plants and stuff came from.  jungle it up in there!|`|KnukPu0Naa	Educate your ignorant self and save a betta.<br>  <a href="http://www.ultimatebettas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatebettas.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://badmanstropicalfish.com/articles/article38.html" rel="nofollow">http://badmanstropicalfish.com/articles/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/articles/article44.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/artic...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tropicalresources.net/phpBB2/agreement_contract.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tropicalresources.net/phpBB2/...</a>|`|NUYMlrTGaa	Well - blood worms freeze dried or frozen certainly shouldn't be a no no for bettas - they love them. That's a little crowded, three in a one gallon would probably require a complete water change at least twice a week.<br>  <br>  If they don't show any signs of disease please test your water quality lethargic fish is usually a big red sign for water quality - I'd guess your tap water isn't high enough in ph or alkalinity.<br>  <br>  P.S. the males are separated right ?

I would highly recommend that you keep them separated or you will have all three bitten and dead.  Please read the source below!|`|mpIiTBVIaa	I would not use melafix. <br>    As for water changes, generally you don't want to take out all the water because you want to leave some healthy bacteria. HOWEVER, if you don't use a gravel vaccum to suck up the old food, then the water  will still be grungy -- and despite what your store told you, that is NOT good for them and will cause them to get sick. I would clean out all the water as you did before if you have no way of suctioning, which you generally don't with a bowl. My bettas always did well when they were in small containers and I did that. If any old water was left in and there was no filter and no way to clean otherwise, then they would get sick. Now, I put bettas in nothing less than 5 gallons each, which is easier to clean. My guess is that your hunch is right, and that the water is dirty and making them sick. Cleaning it should help. You can purchase healhty bacteria if you are worried about not leaving any in there, or get a filter of some kind to help keep the water clean so you can leave some in when you clean it out. good luck!<br>    PS< one thing you could do is clean out all the water, and scrape algae off thes ides, but don't totally rinse out the gravel or rocks. That will keep some healthy bacteria on those. You also an put in some kind of filters and not rinse those every time, also allowing some healthy bacteria to stasy. I hope this helps!|`|PRnF4ovpaa	wow wwowo wow thats unlikely usaully male betta's cant stand 2 seconds with another 1 i would get a bigger bowl tho maybe 3 gallons but im amazed that 3 male betta's can live together peacfully!

PBBdapCWaa	Most males will start showing color around 6 weeks usually.  Females will take 10 days to 2 weeks longer.  No doubt most will have plenty of black and orange on them as the mom's genes are actually more important than the dad's genes when it comes to color in guppies.<br>  <br>  Red colors sometimes show more quickly than some other colors, but that's as much diet as anything else.  To help see the orange faster in your case, be sure they get loads of brine shrimp in their diet.  For color enhancement, frozen adult brine shrimp will usually make a bigger difference than live to be honest.  It's all about the chemicals in the shrimp and live often has been away from the proper ponds and sunlight too long to have enough left in them.<br>  <br>  MM|`|d84b03804cab833afdfbb991099703b0aa	each fish is diferent in how long it takes to get color. for guppies it take anwere from 3 to5 months before they get there color.|`|BIsUdSVBaa	feed them more food it says if you feed them tomato peeling they turn that color|`|e4ec65225a7b3eba7ffab3125d367fd9aa	It will take a little while longer before you start to see some colors. Maybe 2-3 more weeks. the different colors on fish happen at different layers of the skin. As these layers develop the colors start to appear. Usually red is the closest one in and blue or green is the farthest one out. So if they will have colors like the mom then you may see the orange first and then the black patterns will take shape. I never get tired of watching this!
hdojXU1eaa	Do you let the snakes roam around your house at will? If not, you should be fine. Make certain that all of the snake enclosures are secure, that the snakes cannot push open the lids and that the cat cannot knock an enclosure off a shelf or something. The bigger pythons might eat the kitten it given the chance, but the two species should never be interacting anyway (for everyone's benefit). When/if you do take a snake out, put the cat in another room from where the snake is to prevent a prey reaction from the snake and to keep the snake safe from the kitten's claws and teeth.|`|5842cbd9b92850ff74c45212f92fcc8faa	The cat and snakes?

If he is in the house, he must be either crated or closely watched. If you can see that he's getting ready to go, take him outside immediately.

Dry food is the best because it cleans there teeth and it is not full of water. Until house broke, the dog should only be feed once a day at the same time every day. Walk the dog after you feed it. And I mean walk do not just stand there. Then walk him again a half hour after that. You should walk him as many times a day as you can until house broke. Walking helps it pass the food. Walk it in the same place every day. When they smell there own potty it makes them have to go. When the dog goes in the house, clean it up with vinegar. This does 2 things kills the smell+vinegar has a urine bass smell and the dog thinks you r marking this as your turf. When the dog goes in the house put the potty outside where you want it to go. Remember smelling his potty makes him want to go. So no potty smell in the house but lots of potty smell outside. You should have a pin or create just big enough for him to lie down. Most dog will not potty where they lay. Do not put anything in the pin that will soak up pee. When you are not watching your dog, he should be in the pin. If he goes in the house, you should catch him in the act and grab him and yell no then take him outside. Clean it up and take the potty outside. So to rap this up. Walk him as much as you can tell him good boy when he goes outside. When your not watching him keep him it the pin. When he goes inside tell him bad boy and take him outside..|`|haaWI0nwaa	Make sure you clean his mess really well.  They have an amazing sense of smell and they can tell where they usually goes for pee and it makes them want to urinate on the same spot all over again.  Re-train your dog.  Pretend that you are potty training him for the first time and disregard the fact that he is an adult dog.  Google some useful website that will guide you on proper training.  Goodluck!|`|mk2EQQIvaa	one way is when you see it you get your dog and put him near it and spank him it works trust me

Once they stopped giving her the treats the seizures stopped.|`|EzY9rcWBaa	Just like people the degree of severity of seizures that dogs can have can vary. What you are seeing may not be a "grand mal" seizure but it is still a seizure none-the-less. What you describe happening 10 minutes later is known as "chaining". Which means the dog will likely need something to break the pattern of seizures, this is usually some sort of relaxer like valium. <br>  It is likely that he did have a seizure, the more important thing is to figure out what caused it. There are a number of different causes, from epilepsy, a head injury to a ingesting poison. <br>  If it is epilepsy it can likely be resolved through medication (phenobarbital). The others are external sources and should be able to be remedied once they are identified.<br>  HTH|`|0wKCaNocaa	be very careful not to worry you but i have seen dogs do this when they are being poisoned be sure you dog is not being feed by anyone else and he is not licking an anything the may have antifreeze in if like in your driveway or something my do done the same thing and we found out he was allergic to shrimp and we lived behind a seafood restaurant but the vet should be able to tell from the dogs blood work also if the dog is old it could be having kidney failure which sometimes can be corrected easily with a pill and diet change GOOD LUCK with your dog|`|GwnV99Jbaa	I used to have a pomeranian that did this same thing, and it was a gallbladder attack, but i am not sure if that is what your dog is having or not.|`|f64sR36aaa	every dog is different so the seizure might be different than what other dogs have
KeevlZnTaa	Sugar gliders are very high maintenance pets. They are expensive to purchase and even more money to keep. They range from $150 and up, depending on colors.<br>  <br>  Temperament:<br>  Sugar gliders are extremely active and very social animals and do not like to live alone. If you would like to own a sugar glider, plan on having more than one. A lonely sugar glider who is deprived of social interaction, will not thrive. They will become depressed and lonely, which can cause them to die. They need interaction with their owners to be happy. <br>  <br>  Remember that they are nocturnal and are up all night and sleep all day. My gliders used to wake up at about 11pm and were up until about 7am. During the day they didn't like being bothered, imagine someone wanting you to get up and play at 3 in the morning. I am an insomniac and was up all night anyway, so I didn't mind. When I did want to sleep it was difficult, they are very noisy at night, jumping around and barking and chirping. I used to get woken up several times.<br>  <br>  Gliders should be purchased when they are young. Older gliders are hard to tame and may never enjoy being with you. <br>  <br>  Bonding<br>  Gliders must be able to be carried by you during the day in order to bond. I was lucky enough to have a job that didn't mind that I had them with me. You cannot sneak them around with you, as occasionally they will crab, or bark. They are loud barkers.<br>  <br>  It you are not able to carry them for at least a few your a day in a bonding pouch then they may not take to you. <br>  <br>  Even as a bonded pet, they are still not cuddly. A friendly glider is pretty much one that will not bite you and will jump from the cage to you. You're pretty much a bridge for them to get to where they really want :) They do not like being pet or held, I used to just have them jump from the cage to me and back.<br>  <br>  Feeding<br>  The feeding requirements of a sugar glider are somewhat controversial. It is only recently they have been kept as pets, and needs are somewhat of a mystery. As time goes on people will learn more about the needs of these little creatures. Sugar gliders are omnivorous, meaning they will eat plant material and meat. In the wild they feed from nectar, fruit, insects and even small birds, eggs or rodents. This diet is pretty hard to replicate in captivity. People feed them a variety of foods trying to mimic their natural diet as best they can. Some people feed insects such as crickets, meal worms, wax worms, moths and spiders. The insects should be fed high quality food such as commercial cricket food, and dusted with a complete vitamin/mineral supplement. Hence their name, the sugar glider loves the taste of sugar. They like fruit cocktail. The fruit should be fed in small amounts, chopped together so the gliders can not just pick out their favorites. There are many different diets that can be fed. These diets cannot be mixed and match and must be fed according to directions. Incorrect diet can cause serious health issues. Some diets you may want to research<br>  BML, Taronga Zoo Diet, Chicago Zoological Park Alternative Diet , Darcy's Sugar Glider Diet , Elwin's Fresh Food Diet, Priscilla Price's Sugar Glider Diet, Suncoast Glider Diet Plan, etc(there are a few more to this list)<br>  <br>  Cage:<br>  A large cage, the bigger the better, should be provided with plenty of things to jump and leap off of (a minimum of 24 x 24 inches, by 36 inches high). For a sugar glider, height is more valuable than floor space. A wire cage, wire should be no more than ? inch wide, is best to allow the cage to breathe. A plastic tub can be placed under the cage to catch any debris that may fall out of the cage. Lots of toys should be provided as well as an exercise wheel, nest box and/or glider pouch. Branches, ropes and ladders will provide lots of opportunity for climbing and exercise. Large cage is a must, if you do not have the space or $$$ to buy an appropriate cage then do not get a glider.<br>  <br>  Vet care<br>  Since gliders are exotic their veterinary care will cost more. You will need to find a sugar glider knowledgeable vet before you purchase a glider. <br>  <br>  Other info<br>  Male sugar gliders have a unique smell that some people find unbearable. I used to have to clean mine daily(scrubbing cage, washing bedding, cleaning toys) to keep the smell down. The males have scent glands and they mark their territory. Females do not have as bad a smell as males. The cage will need to be cleaned frequently, weather keeping males of females as urine has a strong odor. They usually urinate on the side of the cage, so you need to wash the entire cage, not just the bottom tray.<br>  <br>  Also check for legality in your state. Gliders are illegal in some states and cities.<br>  <br>  Please do as much research as possible on these guys. They are not easy to keep and require very specific care in order to thrive and be healthy.|`|6b19bee29d10cde638359680335bb8c6aa	I've never had one, but i planned on getting one so i did all the research...They're really hard to take care of, and expensive...they need a large tall cage to live in, their diet is incredibly specific,  and they need to be handled often.

tbPKuo3Iaa	Here is what i feel. For flea/tick medicines like Frontline, advantage, advantix, the online buying is my choice, because i know what i need and the price difference is a lot ( not just $2.00) . For example price of frontlineplus large dog 6pk is just 47.00 from www.petcareshoppe.com, even after adding $7.95 shipping  i still save about $25 to $30 on medicines only. Regarding source of these products and genuineness, after talking to lots of supplier and doing some research i found out that these are being shipped from Australia and NewZealand, exchange rate plays a big role in price plus prices in general are lower. FDA warns cosumers to be careful when buying online but as such they don't have any regulation. You can also check with your credit card company to see what kind of purchase protection they give. I read somewhere theat VISA has completely removed cosumer's liability for any online frauds.|`|AA10941048	there are a few things to remember with them. if you're talking heartworm and such, like sentinel interceptor capstar etc, just know that if your dog were to contract heartworm disease, even though it's on the monthly medication, novartis (for example, they make sentinel/interceptor) would help pay for the very costly treatment. sometimes they'll even cover all of it. this is only when the med is purchased through your vet or a designated retailer. they won't help with anything like that if it is from a place like 1800petmeds. Also, the thing that vets don't really like about them, is that there's not regulation on where the meds are coming from. they could be tainted in a way that no one would be aware of. in some cases i suppose they may be easier to obtain, but you have to think if it is worth it. it's not for me, besides, the cost difference isn't much. it's only 2 dollars cheaper through the online store versus my vet. just something to conside i suppose|`|uPIBGXuSaa	Canada does not<br>  have FDA regulations<br>  that the USA does.

T4mKHjuXaa	Description: The Boxer is a medium-sized, squarely built canine of good substance with a short back, strong limbs, and short, tight-fitting coat. Boxers should have a broad, blunt muzzle and an expression of alertness. Their faces resemble that of a Bulldog, and their tails are usually docked for show. Ears are sometimes cropped for show as well, but they naturally have drop ears. Boxers should have a fenced yard to roam in, but will do well in a city environment if walked daily. They do not do well in the heat, but adapt to most other aspects of living environments. The Boxer is considered a "people dog" adapting well to other dogs and children. They are a popular breed all over, retaining their puppy-like tendencies well into old age. Boxers love to play, do well with children, and are youthful at heart. They are obedient, loyal, and learn quickly. Boxers can make excellent guard dogs, as they were used for that purpose in the past and today. They should never be aggressive, but rather even-tempered and loving towards their family, thus making the Boxer an ideal family pet.<br>  <br>  Type: Guardian Dog<br>  <br>  Height: Males: 22.5 - 25 inches; Females: 21 - 23.5 inches.<br>  Weight: Males: 65 - 80 lbs.; Females: 50 - 65 lbs. <br>  <br>  Colors: Fawn, brindle with or without white markings on the face, chest, on the insides of the forelegs and on the feet. They can have a black mask over their face and eyes. Sometimes puppies are born almost all white, but it is not as common.<br>  Coat: Short, shiny, smooth and glossy. The coat is easy to maintain.<br>  <br>  Temperament: Boxers are playful, affectionate, friendly, headstrong, and high-energy. They remain loyal, loving and obedient to their masters. They can be stubborn but are still sensitive and responsive to training. They have the attitude of a puppy when around a loving family, and can be excellent guard dogs towards strangers or strange dogs. They are active dogs, positive and fun-loving. They are very strong and not opposed to a scuffle with other dogs. Boxers can sometimes forget their size and play like a puppy, forgetting the possibility of knocking something or someone over.<br>  With Children: Yes, loyal playmate. Boxers are an affectionate, playful breed who do well with children. Precaution should be taken, however, with small children considering the Boxer's puppy-like attitude when he is much bigger than he thinks.<br>  With Pets: Although generally good with other pets, including dogs, socialization is best. May be aggressive with other male dogs, or new strange dogs.<br>  Special Skills: Guard dog and family pet.<br>  <br>  Watch-dog: High. Their guard dog tendencies exude watch dog abilities.<br>  Guard-dog: High. They are deliberately wary with strangers. Used for guarding in the past, the Boxer retains its status to this day. They are sometimes aggressive towards other strange dogs. Boxers are not afraid of a brawl with the neighbor's dog.<br>  <br>  Care and Training: Boxers require low maintenance for grooming. Nails need regular attention. Boxers are an energetic breed who needs lots of exercise either by a long walks or runs. A well-fenced yard is a must. The Boxer does well with obedience training.<br>  Learning Rate: High. Training can be a challenge as high intelligence combined with dynamic nature demands a patient owner willing to spend extra time and energy on their training. Yet, Boxers are very trainable and learn quickly. They can be stubborn, but remain sensitive and responsive to commands.<br>  <br>  Activity: High. They retain their playful puppy-like nature well into their golden years, and will remain active. The Boxer also needs lots of exercise.<br>  Special Needs: Attention and exercise.<br>  Living Environment: Indoor and outdoor dog. Boxers are people dogs and love to be social inside with their families. But they are also active and love to play, by which they need space and/or good runs or long walks. Boxers do not do well in the heat and should not be kept in a hot enclosure. A yard is a must for Boxers, they are not suitable for an apartment because of their playful, sometimes boisterous nature. Boxers will not let you forget them in the backyard. The best owner for a Boxer would be a family living in the city, suburbs or country. They generally can adapt to most places.<br>  <br>  Health Issues: Usually quite healthy. Boxers may have problems with heart murmurs, hypothyroidism, tumors, and hip dysplasia. Other health concerns include digestive problems.<br>  <br>  Life Span: 8 - 12 years.<br>  Litter Size: 5 - 10 puppies.<br>  <br>  Country of Origin: Germany<br>  History: The Boxers origins stem from as far back as the sixteenth century in Europe. His ancestors are thought to involve mastiff-type dogs called Bullenbeissers (translating to "bull-biter"), English Bulldogs, Great Danes, Boston Terriers, French Bulldogs, and some type of terrier. The general consensus of the Boxers' genetic makeup is that around the 1830s, German hunters created the Boxer from mating a small Bullenbeisser (mastiff-type breed) female to a native, possibly Bavarian, male dog, by which the two produced a female who was then mated to an English Bulldog. Boxers were first used as hunters to the Germans and Nederland residents to hunt boar and deer. Later in Germany, the breed was used in bull baiting and the popular sport of dog fighting. When dog fighting was banned in Germany in the mid-nineteenth century, the Boxer was then put to use as a guard and for controlling cattle at slaughterhouses. This may have been where the Boxer received its current name, being called "boxl" in the slaughterhouses. Another theory states that the name "Boxer" was formed due to their use of front legs when in the fighting ring, resembling a boxer. In 1895 the Boxer breed was exhibited in Munich, by then making a reasonable standard by which to judge, and in 1904 was registered by the AKC. After World War II these dogs became more popular in the United States, and has since received steadily rising praise. Boxers were among the first to become military and police dogs. Although originally bred and raised in a bull-baiting and fighting environments, over the years they have been refined to have a non-aggressive temperament, which certainly shows.|`|0wKCaNocaa	I am a ckc registered boxer breeder my male is taller than my female but my female is bigger that part is all in their blood line looks like Gabe copied the whole first chapter in the boxer book good luck I have three and just sold a litter of eight|`|f3c700c4822f5b23f31e1dd93dcf237faa	Medium (perfect haha) sized. I have a male who is lean and tall, and I have a female who is shorter and fatter. GREAT dogs. Make sure you meet its parents, then you can get an idea of its personality if they have good owners.|`|AA10673375	females are slightly shorter than the males...and usually boxers are medium sized dogs so around 2 feet & 1/2 tall|`|oQWvreCyaa	Boxers are a medium sized dog, with a light and leggy profile, but very solid build.  Like most dog breeds, the male is slightly bigger, but there are individual differences.  My baby is a runt (be careful, I'm the runt of my family) and she's about 20 pounds smaller than she should be (she's 3 years old).
SdArx7AFaa	You will know if too much current is resulting in overoxygenation if you see a buildup of bubbles on the surface of the tank.  Overoxygnation is a bad thing usually caused by too powerful  of a filter.  (It rarely happens, people usually err to the side of too conservative in the filtration department.)  If you are wondering if the fish like the current, watch them carefully.  If they keep getting swept up in it, it is too strong.  But sometimes you have a flow director, and you can redirect the flow to rebound off a wall and soften the current.  If they can swim past or through the current, it is O.K. for the fish and can definitely help the tank "breathe" better.|`|Mw2DQDpzaa	idk|`|wobHU3k2aa	I believe it would depend upon what type of fish you have in your tank. A strong current could quite possibly hurt smaller fish.|`|PBBdapCWaa	Yes, you can have too much current for some species of fish.  That's why I warned you about it in your last question.<br>  <br>  MM|`|lKE7GiHraa	150 GPH is going to create too much of a current for that small of an aquarium. Something that does 40 GPH would be plenty.<br>  <br>  Buying that large of a filter would be like buying an air pump that is made for a 60 gallon aquarium.  Its overkill to the point that it would bother the fish.
YdttQdqgaa	Hi!  My husband and I breed kinkajous for a lving.  We worm them every 90 days using liquid ivermectin.  We draw the appropriate dose into a syringe (based on body weight) and inject the ivermectin into a piece of banana which gets fed to the kinkajous.  Repeat this 10 days after the first worming to be sure you've gotten them all, then do the whole thing again 90 days from the date you gave the first dose.  This has proven to be safe and effective.  The most common parasite in kinkajous is a type of tapeworm.  It looks like thin, translucent spaghetti strands in the feces.  Ivermectin will also knock out a lot of other parasites.  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  -Amy|`|BwG96564aa	I would suggest taking it to the vet and asking if you could give him a medication designated feline or canine and if it would achieve the same results with no ill effects.  I love Kinkajous.

9kceDOTraa	Yes it will regenerate over time.  Most all wounds will heal depending on the source of the problem.  Some will heal faster then others.  The best thing you can do to help promote scale recovery is to keep the water chemistry totally clear of any ammonia or nitirtes, keep the nitrates under control, don't over feed, give a coating of stress zyme to help the fish slime coat over the damaged areas, and as long as the fish can tolerate it, add some aquarium salt.<br>  <br>  JV|`|k1JaR7Agaa	if its losing lots of its scales then there is something wrong with your fish and if left untreated they wont have time to grow back because the fish will be dead before then.<br>  <br>  Get to water tested to see if the problem routes from that.|`|1c3t8S6Kaa	Generally, yes.  <br>  <br>  If only a small portion of scales were lost from an injury, etc.<br>  Usually, however, when they grow back, they look slightly different(not as shiny, not as bright, slightly different color, etc)<br>  <br>  Make sure to keep your water pristine while he is healing up though!  Will make the recovery much easier on your fish.|`|bbb757fc92b8d3e2ca6d621d11511c79aa	They might if a disease or fungus doesn't get in first. Depends a lot on how the fish lost the scales.|`|enN2MGFoaa	They will grow them back at different rates depending on the size of the scales. Large scales take a very long time to grow back, and small scales (like on a dwarf gourami) will grow back very quickly.|`|geFtzAkBaa	nope. i have 10 fish and one lost some of it's scales and that was a year ago.|`|vzuSj9YVaa	They don't loose their scales.

AA10237196	Each of the fishes (MWF & GF) needs completely different water parameters. Not compatible at all.|`|NUYMlrTGaa	Nope, nope and nope. Mexican Walking Fish are actually a brackish water goby also known as mudskippers. Goldfish don't handle salt well and skippers require a fair amount of salt. Beyond that skippers need a part land, part water set up and wouldn't handle high ammonia levels that goldfish produce.<br>  <br>  Here are some critters that could go in brackish water.<br>  <br>  Mollies<br>  Chromide<br>  Fiddler crabs<br>  Scats<br>  Monos<br>  <br>  Bare in mind that you need to be sure your set up can house the fish appropriately as they range in size from 2 inches to 10 or so inches.<br>  <br>  Edit: I think the 'Mexican walking fish' is referring to mudskippers. Might also refer to an amphibious lizard - but then why call it a fish? lol<br>  <br>  Hehe...the heck if I know mudskippers are the only walking fish I know of but the heck if they don't call some crazy, surely not fish fish! I suppose the asker will have to clarify which mentioned critter was actually the one he/she was referring to.|`|tBINPttTaa	I had an axolotl (mexican walking fish if you're wondering) once, and was advised not to keep fish in with them. The fish pick at the tassly parts of their gills and can cause infection and unwanted stress to the axolotl. However, I gave it small feeder fish to eat occasionally as a treat. Axolotls have great healing as they can regrow limbs etc. if they lose any (whether from another axolotl eating it or something else) and have even been known to regrow parts of their major organs!! Umm...mexican walking fish are actually the larval stage of a type of salamander but are able to breed at this stage and don't need to mature and turn into salamander. They live in the mexican lakes in the wild and are considered enangered, however they aren't mudskippers. Mudskippers are different and are found in the mud flats around mangroves in estuaries. Mudskippers are fish and axolotls are actually amphibians. Good luck with your axolotl though (or goldfish, whichever one you own at the moment).<br>  <br>  Sorry bout that, maybe mudskippers are referred to as 'mexican walking fish' also. But I think you're meaning axolotls?
eb7b3f653ea0e97bafa2dd3ddf8e6ac8aa	Ultimately, no, a 100 gallon tank will not be big enough for those four fish.  Each of these fish require about 50-70 gallons each, so you're going to ultimately need about a 200-280 gallon tank for these four fish.  If your fish are still small and not full-grown, a 100 gallon will work for a while.  But, be prepared to upgrade again.  The basic rule for determining filtration for tropical fish is that the filter move 4 times the amount of water per hour as the size of the tank.  So, if you have a 100 gallon tank, you need a 400 gph filter.  A 200 gallon tank would require an 800 gph filter.  As far as heater, any will do just so it has an adjustable thermostat.  Make sure that you have a thermometer as well to keep track of the temperature.  Oscars (Cichlids) like sandy bottoms and lots of rocks, caves and plants that will divide their territories.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	100 gallons is a little on the small side, and definitely too small if you end up with a male and a female wanting to spawn.<br>  Check with your friendly local fish store owner/manager for recommendations.|`|NUYMlrTGaa	You're still going to have to do a fair amount of water changes...they're pretty messy.|`|O0nPJiDHaa	It all depends on how big the oscars are right now.  I have 2 oscars (<- each are about 3 inches long), a smaller oscar,  a pleco, 2 smaller jack demseys, and 2 smaller firemouths all in a 75 gallon tank...
NUYMlrTGaa	Well, the hermit crabs if he can get 'em he'll eat them. The damsels will probably (not here I said probably) only be a target if they're small enough to fit in his mouth.|`|AQIF3qIbaa	yes, the puffer fish are supposed to be very good at cracking shells of shellfish in their tank, especially snails and things.  That is their diet, and they have a big beak for it.  Pufferfish are seriously aggressive fish!  Most keepers recommend them living without any other fish in the tank, unless you have a fairly large sized one!
e49de377def7dc80a5baa53274275b3baa	for the answer before me, you would call 2 small platy's overcrowding a 1 gallon tank, but you would put a betta in there which is 4 times their size, how is that not overcrowding?<br>  <br>  your fish are dying because your tank was not cycled before you put them in there<br>  that means, a tank must be going through a nitrogen cycle, whereas nitrite gets converted into nitrates, and healthy bacteria can grow<br>  <br>  Also platy's need a filter as well as a heater set around 76-82 degrees, since they're tropicals<br>  <br>  I assume you have an undergravel filter, so you do have already a filter<br>  <br>  your fish are most likely dying from either ammonia or nitrite poisening, or through pH shock<br>  <br>  Please read the following on cycling a tank, and the proper way on acclimatizing a new fish to it's new home<br>  <a href="http://www.fishlesscycling.com/articles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlesscycling.com/articles....</a><br>  <a href="http://fishlesscycling.com/forum/index.php?topic=428.0" rel="nofollow">http://fishlesscycling.com/forum/index.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  Good luck|`|rrLHU6ehaa	How long was the tank set up before they died?  Most tropical fish need a heater, as well as a filter and aerator. You probably can't do anything for the sick fish at this time.<br>  Before getting or accepting any fish, you should do research to find out it's needs, then set up accordingly at least one week before getting the fish.|`|488823611b3dd130eb3a102a9da58b4caa	what are you keeping in a 1 gallon tank?  1 betta would do ok but he wouldn't be that happy about it.  <br>  <br>  to save the sick one change the water.  fish need acess to clean water -- in 1 gallon stuff can build up really fast so the only chance you have of keeping anything in there is changing out 1/2 the water every couple days.|`|9JjZ9dZIaa	they are overcrowded. or you are putting warm or hot water in cause that water is cloudy. it happended to me|`|NUYMlrTGaa	Actually your tank was going through a normal process called Cycling, in order to get good bacteria in your tank there must first be bad waste for it to eat. In the time period (usually about a week) it takes for the good bacteria to build up your bad waste (ammonia, nitrates and nitrites) is just having a field day on your poor tank.<br>  <br>  However a few other things to consider. First, unless your two fish were really small you over crowded your tank. Unless your dealing in 'micro-fish' I wouldn't put anything put a Betta or maybe a guppy in a 1 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  If you post what kind of fish it is perhaps we can have a few ideas as to how to save the poor fellow.|`|xGdTLfEAaa	If they are tropical fish, they need a filter.  It also sounds like they were being overfed (cloudy water).   A filter would help combat this though.  Excess food/waste causes nitrogen build up and kills fish.<br>  <br>  Another consideration: Is the water too warm/too cold?|`|PMZkQAQUaa	You should only have 1 fish in a 1 gallon tank. Check the temp, don't overfeed. The water in tanks usually do turn cloudy when they are first set up.  It usually goes away but you may want a filter. But it is kind of hard to say why they are dying. Oh and plz take the dead fish out of the tank.
3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	The koi might eat it, especially if it's large enough.  ADF's don't see very well, and will have a hard time finding the food you feed them.

DbUkstMzaa	For cats with heartworm, there is currently no safe and effective treatment. Cats can be treated with canine heartworm but this can lead to dangerous side effect including lung failure and death. But heartworm IS 100% preventable in cats who are NOT infected.<br>  <br>  First the cat must be given a blood test to make sure he is not already infected with the disease. The blood test is not always definitive. To confirm it a series of other tests(x-ray, ultrasound) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. If the cat does not have heartworm it  can be given a heartworm preventative.<br>  <br>  Cats who have heartworm can be treated for the "symptoms" in hopes that it will outlive the worms which can remain in the body for about 2 years.<br>  <br>  The good new is that while heatworm affects about 60% of dogs, only 15-20% of cats are affected.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avma.org/communications/brochures/heartworm/heartworm_brochure.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.avma.org/communications/broch...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cpvh.com/Articles/15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpvh.com/Articles/15.html</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|cOnEkyKBaa	Here's an informative piece on heartworm in cats ~<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/5150/heartworm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/5150/...</a><br>  <br>  ==|`|e90ea30dd34d6cfa96a8142931a15cd6aa	I took my kitty to the vet when he was having bad coughing spasms.

You should clean your water bowl at least every three or four days and refill it everyday.  If he is still young he needs to learn to slow down when eating.  I don't think they throw up because they are hungry because i leave their food out all day long and let them eat whenever.  I know it is hard when your a first time owner and freak out alot.  In order to avoid alot of unneccesary vet bills i suggest reading alot and doing research about dogs.  It really helped me to go to the library and read about my breed and behaviors and possible problems.  There is a really good book that is like an at home guide to common dog problems and how to treat them without having to go to the vet like doggy first aid.  Read up and do internet research.

jKoFo0bhaa	They are not a quiet breed.<br>  According to this page on the breed "The Japanese Spitz can be an inveterate barker" and is also a  "bold little dog is a good watchdog"<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/japanesespitz.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/japanesespit...</a>|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	generally a quiet dog, but will definately bark if someone comes to ur place......|`|NFkCgTM7aa	All spitz breeds are notorious barkers.|`|YMuNrQEFaa	The Japanese Spitz is usually a quiet dog but when made excited they may bark i have a Japanese Spitz she only barks when i play with her or when i get in from school xx
oVuoiEk8aa	Just give him some time to heal and everything will work out. His personality will change, but not in a negative way. <br>  <br>  He won't stop loving you or become aggressive or anything like that. He will most likely stop doing territorial behaviors such as marking (which means no more cleaning doggy pee), and he won't go roaming for a female. <br>  <br>  Good Job going ahead with the surgery! I wish more pet owners would do this!<br>  <br>  {{...*Spontania *...}}|`|7iaDMqvlaa	He will be less hyper, but that's about it. He'll be normal within the week, I can guarantee. Right now, he's just a little confused and upset/uncomfortable. He'll get used to the stitches.|`|8tHWSQveaa	He will probably get back to normal in a couple of days. He just had surgery. Imagine how you would feel.|`|AA11385027	If he seems to be unusually interested in the drawer you keep the sharp knives in I'd keep an eye on him and post a guard at my door during the night time!|`|PQlbtVnLaa	He most likely yelped because he's sore from his surgery.<br>  <br>  His personality may change, he may be less dominant and aggressive because he now has less testosterone in him.|`|eZ368EIdaa	of course he's sore.  give it a wee at the most and he should be back to hinself.|`|342f2fe9069a5477ccca1bf6ecfd9b33aa	He should be all healed up in 10 days. His personality wont change but it should calm him down a bit. He wont be chasing girls around anymore! He is going to be in a good bit of pain for about the next 3 days so just keep him calm and try not to carry him. If you have a crate for him it would be a good idea to just let him stay in there for the next couple of days besides taking him to potty and eat.|`|EgTiPU62aa	My puppy was neutered last month. He was still a bit groggy when I brought him home. But the next day he was back to his old self,never staying still and ready to rough house with my other dog. It was a chore trying to keep him still ! But I was given pain meds for him to take for 5 days afterward. He never showed signs of being in any pain. That could be due to his having laser surgery, the vet said it causes less pain. And so far he has shown no signs of personality change !  He truly lives up to his name--Rowdy ! <br>    Give your dog a couple of days or so and he will be back to normal. Just watch the stitches to make sure they stay clean and don't get infected.|`|zwuRkknUaa	Well, to answer your first question, it is natural that he will be sore. <br>  <br>  His personality may change, but it would be for the better! He won't hump things, he won't roam, and may calm down quite a bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kudos to you for neutering!
dl1OOOT8aa	If the dog wasn't like this before, then most likely it will be back to it's bouncy normal self in a couple of days. She's just recovering from surgery. Typically female dogs take longer to recover than males.|`|jSo7Hy7Haa	It will take a few days for her to get better, It is normal that she will be tired as she just had surgery.  Just be there for her and she'll reward you many times in the future.<br>  <br>  Females get spayed.  Males-neutered.<br>  <br>  P.S. Thanks for spaying your dog.  The overpopulation of animals is a crisis and wonderful dogs are being put down because shelters don't have the kennel space to hold them.<br>  Puppy litters cause the doom of many fine canines.  Pass the word.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's just the anesthetic.  She'll be more herself in a day or two.  If she's a she, she was spayed.|`|6efb1915453e10ba302a119e6d5cbf7baa	She's groggy and tired from the anesthesia, it is perfectly normal.  Just keep her hydrated, let her rest as much as she pleases, and keep her from scratching/nipping/licking the incision area.  The sooner it heals, the sooner she can go back to her playful little self!|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	It's the medication they give her she will be fine in a few days.  Just love her and coddle her, she needs it now.|`|XGtbCZCZaa	My dog was out of when she came home from being spayed the next day she was fine.|`|kFfaVngSaa	shes tired from the whole thing give her some time|`|BxgJGP62aa	It is normal.  She'll be out of it for a few days or so.|`|Ef1nCMkBaa	Don't worry.Its just the medication!|`|K7iaCOSRaa	She is still under her medications.  Do not let her jump or play hard for a few days as this may cause her not to bounce back fully.  Allow her a few days to relax, since she just had major surgery.  She will be her sweet playful self in a few days.  She may not want to eat today either or become sick if she does.  Just give her time to sleep, plenty of fresh water and keep an eye on her.|`|KLWAYX4xaa	she will be tired for a day or two|`|a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Your dog just had major surgery. ( the procedure for a female dog is much more intrusive than for a male dog.)<br>  Give her time to recover.... (Why would you expect her to want to play? You wouldn't want to shoot hoops if you just had your appendicts removed.)<br>  You should have gotten instructions for her after surgery care from the shelter. If you didn't call them and ask.<br>  She will be just fine in the next day or so. Of course you have to watch her stitches and make sure they are healing OK.<br>  Call the shelter if you have any concerns.<br>  Also, thank you for getting your pet neutered! More people should do that! good luck!|`|eZ368EIdaa	she is still under some effects from the anesthesia.  give her a day or 2 to rest.  if given pain meds this will effect her also|`|kJ7gZwxqaa	it is the meds from the surgery....she will snap out of it by the morning.<br>  She shouldn't do too much playing, running and umping for the first week after the spay so don't encourage that!!|`|cd765fc635a20969ba06b2918808a480aa	Be gentle with your girl.  She needs patience & understanding & will be tried after the anaesthetic, as well as the surgery itself.  It is also wise to keep an eye on her so that she doesn't lick any external stitches out too soon.  <br>  <br>  Any surgery is exhausitng for the body and the same with your young lady, particularly as this is not a minor operation.  In a human it takes several weeks for a woman to get over such an operation, so will your girl, although it probably won't take her as long to recouperate.  <br>  <br>  She will also be sore & tender inside.  It's sometimes difficult to understand as the main surgery is unseen.  Her post op. medications will also be adding to her lethargy.   It's probably also been a little truamatic for her, not knowing what was happening, as well as having been in different surroundings, and away from familiar faces & love. <br>  <br>  It's also worth being aware that her hormones may be different now & this could have an effect on her personality, so she may need a little TLC for a while.  She may not be quite as active as she would hve been before the operation as she may go through hormonal changes similar to that of a woman experiencing menopause. <br>  <br>  I am sure she is in good hands & that you will look after her well.   Enjoy your young lady.<br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  Wendy|`|lh3vNHWWaa	noooo  attitude.  She is sleeping due to the meds & the trauma to her little body.  spaying is the equivelent to a womans hysterectomy. She will be sore & sleepy she is just healing.  she will be fine!

Chihuahua people don't like that term. In  reality I find that there really are very few truly undersized Chis. That said most pet people would see the show style Chihuahua as a teacup because truthfully what is shown is a heck of a lot smaller than most pet style dogs in the breed. So I would seek one from a show person. It will be plenty small, probably smaller (statistically speaking) than one that is advertised as a teacup. But don't mention the phrase teacup to a show Chihuahua person. They don't like people breeding pet stock down so small it has problems and then advertising them as T Cups. Way back when the term first came out it was simply to say small like the show style. But now it has become more than that.<br>  BTW if you can't afford a puppy, many show people do seek homes for older puppies and dogs. It isn't about the money. its about the home to them so ask a few.|`|LBnDEWgRaa	If you can't afford to pay more than $100, how are you going to afford on-going care?  "Teacups" are really just poorly bred dogs that come with a lot of expensive problems.  Wait until you can afford both the dog AND the care for it before you become a Pet Owner.  You should plan on at least $1000 a year for good food, basic vet care and the host of doggie paraphenalia.  Then there's the emergencies!|`|Cp7HXe7Jaa	no such trhing as a teacup chihuahua those are just underfed chihuahua's with sicknesses and the least you can get a chihuahua for is 400$ unless someone is giving them away....check in the newspaper, in your neighboorhood, leave out flyers etc.|`|zZZnQuQJaa	Try Macy's China department...They have lots of Teacups, I'm not sure if you'll be able to find one with a Chihuahua on it though...|`|vCVvXsZVaa	Consider breed rescue, but I doubt you can afford the costs associated with even routine vet care for the dog. Animal shelters are looking for the best homes available for these dogs (so the don't end up getting them back & having to re-home them), and just because you want one doesn't mean you'll get one. The "teacup" puppy you want is financially well out of your reach, and the younger the dog, the higher the cost for vet care/altering. No one of conscience is going to to "help" you get a dog you won't be able to care for. I'm sorry to be harsh, but yes, you do need to mature to own a dog, unless you plan to make someone else financially responsible for it (and please make sure they're willing to first). Purchasing/paying adoption fees will be the smallest cost of responsible dog ownership.|`|91CX5jHaaa	First off, check out this link aobut teacup chihuahuas: <a href="http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/teacup.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/te...</a><br>  <br>  The only chance you'll have is to find a chihuahua to adopt.  Due to the waning of the Paris Hilton craze, there are usually plenty in shelters and rescues.  Be well aware that there are lots of expenses for a dog beyond the purchase price, so be sure you won't be on here in a few months asking, "My dog has bood coming out of it's eyes, is throwing up gallons of slimy green vomit, and won't get up off the floor.  I can't afford a vet.  What do I do?"  God!  I hate those asshole questions!|`|afaAhlbGaa	Regardless of the ethics of actively encouraging the seeking out of the litter runts, the breeding of dogs etc, if you can't afford over $100 for the dog, how are you going to pay for shots, vets bills, castrations, kennels for holidays?<br>  <br>  *edit* kudos to jennifer t...well put and echoes my sentiments exactly.<br>  <br>  To the asker, no you don't have to be mature to love a dog. But you *do* have to be mature to ensure it has the welfare and care it needs. The attitude you display wanting a dog to be purposely under weight is selfish, immature and cruel. Chihuahuas and other small breeds are fast ending up in shelters because of the attitudes of selfish young people. Grow up and don't be one of the masses of 'faddy pet keepers'|`|CsKGdUx0aa	Sweetie, teacups are poorly bred and come riddled with health problems. 'Teacup' is nothing more than a marketing term to make sickly dogs sound more desirable. If you want a chi, they come in one size only....Standard.

It's no joke. <br>  <a href="http://www.chiwantone.com/documents/teacupwarning.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiwantone.com/documents/teac...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: There are people here (like myself) who were trying to help you by saving you the trouble of purchasing one of these dogs and incurring thousands in vet costs.

That being said, maybe you should reconsider getting a dog if you can only afford $100. Dogs require food, treats, toys, collars, leashes and vet visits, which all cost $.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a hampster or a goldfish.|`|26keippWaa	If you really want something smaller than a chihuahua, you may want to consider getting a hamster.  They're cheaper too.|`|TldYGEwuaa	Those don't excist.<br>  Get a regular one, not a runt.<br>  Thats all a teacup is.|`|0Ma01svvaa	do u know what a "teacup" dog is?<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a 'teacup" breed of dog. The terms "teacup" ("tea cup") and "tiny toy" are not used officially by any kennel club, but the increasing frequency of their use by laypersons (someone who is not a clergyman or a professional person) has led some to believe that the terms are official. Since the terms are unofficial, there is no accepted standard of their definition, but they are widely understood as describing particularly small adult toy dogs, usually smaller than the breed standard indicates.<br>  <br>  Some breeders have expressed concerns that the terms are used by unscrupulous breeders (ppl that do trade and are not restrained by ideas of right and wrong) to fool purchasers into paying inflated prices for dogs that may be unhealthy or need special care due to their extremely small size.<br>  <br>  Unknowledgeable breeders use this cutesy phrase as a 'marketing term' for the smallest dog. You do NOT want a dog under 3 or 4 pounds, no matter how cute it is. These individuals are great risks in the health department. Their<br>  bones are fragile, there is not enough room in their mouth for healthy teeth, and their internal organs are often very weak.<br>  <br>  They tend to have lots of health problems and great difficulties<br>  regulating their blood sugar. Often they live a few years and then their owners wake up one morning and find them dead in their baskets from sudden heart or other organ failure.<br>  <br>  To make matters worse, some breeders actually charge MORE for these high-risk dogs. There are breeders on the Internet taking advantage of naive buyers with outrageous prices that are much, much higher than the usual price.<br>  <br>  They are also prone to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and dehydration because they are so small. A bout of diarrhea inconsequential for a normal-sized pup can mean hospitalization for a 'teacup' poodle puppy. Dental problems are also significant, with retained puppy teeth and rotting adult teeth needing surgical attention. Again, their charms<br>  more than outweigh their downfalls, but anyone contemplating an extreme size should be aware of what they are getting into.<br>  <br>  oh, and if u want a dog that is not over $100, then good luck to u! dogs usually are not that cheap unless u get one for free or u buy a toy one from target or wal-mart, lol. plus, u have to pay a whole lot for medical bills like check-ups, shots, deworming, neutering/spaying, plus their dog food, bowls, flea/tick medicine, toys, treats, and they need a whole lot of TLC.
5e15b1ed34ea652d6bc844b888c9afafaa	how olds your dog? <br>  <br>  if between 1-12 months training should be easier.<br>  if adult dog it will become harder<br>  also is the dog adopted from a previous owner/kennel...<br>  <br>  im assuming he is around 5+ months.<br>  <br>  i think the pooing and peeing is from nervousness/anxiety. <br>  <br>  dont watch him if he is the crate (if by watch you mean sit next to it to comfort him) because he may interpret he has done something wrong, or want to get out when he sees you. do something like put you dog in his crate, leave the house for 2-5 minutes, and return, let your doberman out again. repeat this for a while and increase the time each time so he knows your gonna return. sometimes it helps to put a towel you have used or a tshirt type thing that smells of you for your dog. leave the crate open when he doesnt need to be in it, and encourage him to go in it when he looks tired, and reward him loads loads loads when he does. maybe putting some of his favorite toys inside will help, and sometimes you can hide a few treats in his bed so he can find them while being inside the crate. always before you go out let your dog out quickly to do business.<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|3VO81VDSaa	Put him in the crate with a treat, close the door but then sit by the crate but with your back to it and ingore him, work on moving further away from the crate. Covering the crate and leaving a radio on worked for me.|`|VhglabAmaa	this is also down to separation anxiety, so you might justg have to let it get uaed to being away from it first before you use a cage|`|TpTwyMB2aa	try not being in the same room as the crate, if he sees you he will want to get out|`|QwMzzXW4aa	Before you leave him in it closed up give him a few days to get used to it.  When he is sleepy carry him over to the crate and leave the door open.  When he is calm throw a few treats in there to get him to go it.  Don't close the door.  Put some toys in there for him.  Make it a safe place (cover it over with a blanket).  Never use it for punishment.  For the first few days he should only be closed in at night.  After that try closing him in for 10-15 minutes.  Completely ignore any protests he makes (he will make them).  Come back when he is quiet and calm for 2-3 minutes and praise him.  Slowly extend the time he is locked in the crate over another few days.  Ultimately, it boils down to - you just have to listen to his protestations until he calms down.  Never go and let him out when he barks and whines.  It teaches him that this behavior gets him what he wants.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3YCTEzcbaa	He doesn't like it. Not all dogs adapt to a cage. They have individual personalities like people. Is there any way that you can just tie him up with a collar and chain/rope for that hour? Love your dog, don't torture him by trying to make him do something for such a short amount of that he absolutely hates. If he is house trained, an hour is nothing to leave him alone. Or put him in your bathroom and shut the door. Just make sure he can't lock it while you are gone. His nerves are on edge way too much to be in a crate.|`|FcrpH8Glaa	you have to make the crate have nice memories for him. encourage him in there through out the day  with the door open, once he looks relaxed give him a treat. first do it for 5 mins then increase the time. Once he is fine with that do it again with the door closed. you cant expect a dog to get used to a crate straight away. I am taking a week off work when i get my pup so we can work on him getting use to a crate and being left alone, When you do go out leave an old jumper or something with your smell on it inside the cage|`|oGpSSaghaa	they all whine untill they get used to it, my dog now loves her crate and when i say bed shes the first up the stairs and in it!, she whined for a while i remember it was terrible, she sleeps in it all night so we had whining and hardly no sleep for days but now ita like her lil bedroom, its also helped with her toliet training now when i go out i leave her in the front room and dhe hasnt weed or pooed for months touch wood, if she does anything tomo i will be contacting you!!! lol|`|4I8Dgc4Waa	start feeding him in it|`|FNEIgPgKaa	I doubt that he has a crate problem, actually. He probably does the exact same thing if you close him into the bathroom, right? The crate predicts your absence which is why he starts fussing even when you're still there.<br>  <br>  Your dog probably has a separation issue, and you should talk with your veterinarian about it. Dogs who are home most of the time with somebody (at home parent, working at home, retired, etc.) are more prone to this. Talk with your vet and find out about Clomicalm, which is a medication used to treat separation anxiety. <br>  <br>  Here's a good link for more info about SA:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wagntrain.com/SeparationAnx.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagntrain.com/SeparationAnx.h...</a><br>  <br>  It's an anxiety disorder and you're going to need professional help. Your vet may prescribe Clomicalm, but you'll need to do the behavior modification piece to be most effective. Make sure that your vet does more than just hand you the meds and the package insert.<br>  <br>  There's also a very good booklet by Dr. Patricia McConnell, entitled, "I'll Be Home Soon: the Prevention and Treatment of Separation Anxiety":<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ill-Home-Soon-Patricia-McConnell/dp/1891767054" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ill-Home-Soon-Patr...</a><br>  <br>  Focusing on the crate issue will not help, because you don't have a crate problem. If you work on the part about her being anxious when separated, that will be helpful.<br>  <br>  The usual behavior modification is working on an independence program in the house when you are home (can't sleep with you, touch you while resting, follow from room to room), uncoupling departure cues, graduated departures, and creating a "safety signal". You'll need professional help, not just "tips". Start by talking with the vet and getting a referral. SA doesn't go away on its own, and it tends to get worse. Managing it by trying to take him with you everywhere works until it gets too hot/too cold to leave him in the house, which I'm guessing you already know....<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|XEbe4Votaa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Your-Dog-to-Love-the-Crate" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Your-Dog-to...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  add: I have a new dog who for some strange reason has decided she is afraid of her crate.  What I have been doing is putting her in my bedroom with the door gated.  Then, putting treats and chewies and even her food in the crate for her to slowly realize the crate is not scary.  While I do trust her to be out of the crate as long as she's gated in a room, she needs to learn to accept the crate.|`|4OUszQ6zaa	You have to reward him for being in the crate and behaving. What works for my dog is you put a hard bone in and fill it with peanut butter and then put it in the freezer. Putting it in the freezer allows it to last longer. Also maybe put one of their favorite chew toys in it. This has worked positively for my dog and he loves going in it.
5YOqOiM9aa	I don't have much time, so I will explain this quickly. Fish Bowls are death traps for any fish, and in my opinion, no fish can be kept in. Even if a type was in it, there would definitely not be room for babies!<br>  <br>  For coldwater, goldfish are too messy and require a much larger tank. They need a minimum of 20 gallons for the first one, and 10 - 15 gallons more for each added. So, goldfish are not an option. They also need a really strong filter, which can't be put in a bowl.<br>  <br>  For tropical, they need a heater and a filter. So even if there is enough room for like 1 fish, they can't live in a bowl because there can't be a heater and a filter.<br>  <br>  So, return or ditch the bowl, and I think you should just get a 10 gallon. You can get a full kit with heater filter, everything for $20, and then you'll actually be able to keep some fish!<br>  <br>  Sorry to disappoint you, but it's only the truth. Good Luck|`|JIGNnm5yaa	I'm sorry to say that it is highly unlikely that any fish you put in the bowl will survive for long, let alone have babies :-(<br>  <br>  Fish need a lot of care.  Before you buy any I suggest you either buy a book or do a lot of research on the internet.  If you just put fish in the bowl they WILL die - maybe not straight away, but they certainly won't live out their natural lifespan (which in many cases is over 40 years!)|`|hH4ljTJbaa	if its a tropical tank  mollies and platies are very good  they come in an array of colours  an can breed easily if a swordtail is introduced    guppies are also a very suitable fish  but breed alot and have many babies!!|`|mFgyfiVVaa	The ONLY fish that you can keep in a bowl is a Betta, otherwise known as a Siamese Fighting Fish. <br>  Go to the petstore and talk to them about it.<br>  <br>  JUST DONT GET A GOLDFISH!

You can't possibly afford a dog.  Just yesterday, you were saying how you'd have 2-3 hours max during the week. <br>  <br>  I'll repeat what I said again:<br>  <br>  2-3 hours is not enough time to spend with a dog. <br>  <br>  You sound young, so my honest answer, is that you should not have a dog right now. <br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with you personally, but where you seem to be in life. <br>  <br>  If you truly feel you are ready, then head to a local rescue organization and pick out a dog that fits your needs. <br>  <br>  I can sit here and tell you that "Labs are the greatest dogs ever", but if you hate fur, then it's terrible advice. <br>  <br>  I can sit here and tell you that "Yorkies are the coolest dogs around", but if you only have 2-3 hours to be near your dog and can't handle barking, then it's terrible advice. <br>  <br>  Find a dog from a shelter. Then, research the breeds. Go from there. : )<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ---And I'll amend that.  You should not have a dog.

kxcXcZZMaa	I agree with adora. The cat could be having difficulty smelling the food which is why putting some directly in the mouth helps a lot. Cats generally won't eat what they can't smell. I would go to the vet to get Hill's Prescription Diet A/D canned food. It can be put in a syringe to force feed the kitten. I have done it a few times to sustain the energy. The other thing you can do is get Nutrical, either from your vet or petco for $10. It is a high calorie, high protein paste that most cats love. I have only ever had one cat refuse it. You can put a little on your finger that put that on their tongue so they know it's yummy food. Then you can usually just offer them more and they eat it on their own. Otherwise you can put it in a syringe and force feed them that. <br>  When one of my kittens was having trouble smelling I gave her Purina pro plan sardines and anchovies in aspic, it's a very smelly food.<br>  <br>  BTW a second way to test for dehydration is to touch their gums if they are slimy then the cat is hydrated enough, if they are sticky that means the cat is dehydrated. The scruff test is good too, but personally  sometimes I can't tell if it snapped back fast enough so I use this method.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|cOnEkyKBaa	You seem to have gone through all the necessary steps to try and solve the problem.

If the  skin settles right back down with almost no hesitation then she is hydrated and no worries, if there is some hesitation or you lift the skin and it dosent move then thats very bad, and you need to get her to the vet asap.. also for the food issue I would see if the vet would let you try a can of a/d canned it is prescription food, but in my experience that is what all the kittens that wouldn't eat would eat, also if you tried the baby food, i was wondering if maybe she might have  a smelling problem??? try heating up the baby food it makes the smell more potent... and actually put some of the food in her mouth..to get her to taste it, honestly I have done this before and you put the food in front of them they might act like their sniffing it and then they show no interest i put some food in their mouth and they started chomping down.....  and if she got 1 or 2 vaccinations thats alot for a small kitten to take at one time, more so if she was already having eating issues, and they can have reactions, also maybe when you go back see if they can break up the shots and do one at a time, one of my cats had a reaction to a rabies shot about 6 years ago, but has since been okay and still gets them now...  some cats just cant handle more than 1 at a time. i would also say if she throws up any more call your vet.... because that means things are coming out and most likely she wont eat anything and thats not good because of her age....  but best of luck.. i would keep doing what your doing... |`|6aS27MC8aa	pizza crust|`|QQPVtQ20aa	Try giving her some yogurt (but not a lot!!) Generally kittens that won't eat due to digestive or respiratory disorders will eat yogurt. Don't give her too much though because most cats are lactose intolerant and this can cause more digestive upset. But they like the taste and it's a good way to get some water and food in them. It is very VERY important to keep a cat hydrated (a cat can succumb to dehydration very quickly), and if a cat doesn't eat within a few days it can develop something called feline hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver, see link below).<br>  <br>  Try giving your cat some probiotics (ask your vet for which kind) when it starts feeding again, this will help with digestive issues.|`|ioVRxBEtaa	She may be a picky eater- I would by Iams, or Science Diet for kittens, my cats love them. she may be a little ill from the shots and not too worry- she will eat when she is hungry, if not call the vet- 
cOnEkyKBaa	Well, you can pick them up gently and hold them in front of your face and say "Nooooo" everytime they do it, and then put them down equally gently. This will probably have no effect whatsoever on when the kitten decides to stop attacking your bare skin (It's a common kitten thing) but it will give you the temporary illusion/delusion that you're in charge when a cat is involved ;)<br>  <br>  == |`|tT5jyle5aa	hahaha!  i am just giggling because i remember when my cat was a kitten and he would do that.  you just have to train your kitten not to do it.  whenever he does something you don't want him to do, spray him with water and or make a sound that he doesn't like and he will stop.  it will take a while, but he will learn.  |`|PrFo0Nf8aa	lol i love it when kittens do that.<br>  <br>  when mine were kittens they'd climb up my legs, regardless of if i was wearing pants or shorts.<br>  <br>  im pretty sure it's just a phase :)|`|RHw32D8Haa	whenever the kittens are near scratch your legs|`|UNFxjNHkaa	when my cats were kittens they would also do this.  I would be standing in the kitchen and my kitten would take a running start from the front door and climb up my entire body.  Very cute, but verrrry painful...  That is when i started clipping his nails!  Haha.. But he eventually stopped as he got older, i think its just a phase too.
Ytu9ItaMaa	yes it is dominance.......sometimes females will mark as well....he could have been worried that the female was going to do this.......

Mind you, the best answer to a lonesome cat is to have two cats :)<br>  <br>  As for "snorking", it's not a problem unless it becomes persistent, impairs respiration, or results in a lot of vomiting or hairballs. <br>  <br>  Cats are efficient pukers and ridders of fur - no way around it. It's the nature and frequency of same that needs to be monitored, along with other things like the cat's weight and activity level.<br>  ==|`|ed3f82150457440a3f2f7f6f16b0c4c4aa	Cats are independent, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about leaving her alone during the day.  My cat is left home while I am at work.  I think she sleeps all day, because she is usually bouncing off the walls at night, wanting to play! |`|D70hhBWUaa	She will be fine on her own, just make sure theres nothing around her that she could knock over or something..as to the snorking im sure she will be fine but if it happens again and your worried get it checked out by the vet|`|nTHV9cxfaa	Yes she will be fine don't worry to much and if you find that she is getting into things you don't want her to find a nice sized room and put all of her things in their and her when you leave for work until she and you get more comfortable with her being out in the whole house.

Adopted an adult is wonderful!<br>  <br>  When I work outside my home, I leave music on for my cats, or a talk show, so they hear human voices. Of course since I have two kitties they keep each other company. But they do sleep a lot when I am gone.<br>  <br>  The sound you describe may be an attempt for her to chuck up a hair ball, but I would just keep and eye on her and if necessary take her for a vet check. It is always a good idea when getting a new kitty to get a check up and any vaccinations they need.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a tall cat tree near a window. Rough textured cat trees are the best as cats don't use them for sharpening claws, they use them to clean nail sheaths, and to scent mark from glands in their paws. One with shelves and little tunnel like additions are very much appreciated. You can get them rather inexpensively on eBay, actually.<br>  <br>  For a new cat owner, I also recommend getting a few good books about cats. Amazon.com has some excellent ones.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck with your new fur friend.

YGyD8Yt6aa	They just like to be around you. I think it's natural for a cat and owner to be close. My cats generally love to be with my mum out of all of us living here. And besides, it's a bed :) Comfy for you, comfy for them.|`|pjzQ1VP9aa	Cats love to be around people they would rather sleep with you then their bed, because they may love being around you and sometimes cats love your scent and besides beds are COMFY and trust me my cat will die to sleep in my bed |`|YB6shxezaa	You like sleeping in the bed right?... hmmm<br>  <br>  it's a freaking bed it's comfortable|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	affectionate|`|qk769xdoaa	they just love you and want to sleep with you 
crjnnRoHaa	Oh, he's just a little guy!  3 or 4 weeks is so young.  It doesn't sound like he was probably ready to leave Mom yet!  Is he eating solid food okay?  Are you sure he's not a bit older and just perhaps small?  I would be a little concerned that your two older cats may gang up on him with him being so tiny and young.  I would continue to keep them separate until he can defend himself and they can get more used to each other.  Do you have a room with a comfy bed and LOTS of toys for the little kitten?  When you get home from work, I'd begin to introduce them to each other while watching tv or doing housework.  They will get used to each other eventually.  They may not ever be best buddies but they'll tolerate each other.  One important thing is are both of your older males neutered?  If not, please neuter them ASAP.  I'm not saying this as some fanatical "there are too many unwanted cats" people but because un-neutered cats can really be a danger to a little kitten.  They are just way too territorial.  I'm assuming that they are neutered #1 because the smell of two un-neutered cats is just the worst smell in the world and you wouldn't have any company and people would avoid you at work, lol!  and #2 you sound like a responsible cat owner.  If they aren't neutered and it's a financial problem, I can help you find someone in your area to neuter them for next to nothing.  Just e-mail me.  Are you sure that you want to keep the kitten?  Since he is so young, if you don't want to really keep him (since he was dumped on you), NOW would be the ideal time to find a new home since he's still so young and cute.  Maybe someone that doesn't have a cat.  Whatever you decide, good luck!  Do you have a name for him yet???|`|h3Nw1O1xaa	I had this problem with a cat I had, except the older one was bullied by the younger one.

FFr7WEEvaa	pitbull, doberman, german shepherd, rottie, any breed of mastiff|`|UvBK3p9raa	Well, our smaller 35lb dog who is a house dog scares away plenty of people as she sounds 2x to 3x larger than she is, and they cannot see her from outside.  However, I would say most larger breeds over 55 lbs would do the job.  It would help if you did not have a dog that is not prone to coming up to fence and trying to lick everyone coming by.  Honestly, the best guard dogs I've ever owned were Great Pyranees.  They are around 100lbs of dog.  They bond very closely to whoever - people, life stock, you name it that they grown up with when young and will protect their people, animals, etc. with their life if need be.  These dogs can go from sweet fuzzballs to quickly sound like Cujo if an unwanted person or something else is nearby.  However, they are the sweetest family dogs as well as long as you do not have very small children as the weight issue becomes a problem aka accidentally knocking them over.  Due the their protective nature, they need to be very throughly & properly socialized as puppies and new people need to meet the dog with a bonded family member first.  As long as you introduce your dog to new people with you, your dog if properly trained and socialized will be fine with your guests.  A word of warning, these are naturally wandering dogs who need a good fenced in yard or they will wander off.  It is only in their nature as guard dogs.<br>  I love Great Pyranees due to their sweet nature, personality, frequent nap schedule, the ability to go kill a rattlesnake and immediately lie back down and sleep, extremely soft coat, high intelligence, and loyalty.   Good Luck!|`|2sOOgiWBaa	i have two dobermans, they still think they're puppies and like to cuddle with me on the couch. however, when i walk them and someone comes by that they don't trust or doesn't smell right, they stay directly right next to me on both sides and wait till that person crosses. animals in general are really intuitive and can sense trouble. they are a really loyal breed if you have them since they are young pups. they look scary to other people but to me they're little wusses that crawl onto my lap at night.<br>  <br>  i love them to death.|`|naxV7TERaa	  great dane for sure! i own two. one night this guy was walking next to my window my dog jumped to the window stuck her head out growled snarled and barked and he literally ran. no one comes near my house because of them. their real great dogs. very big and intimidating because of their size. their teeth are huge!|`|DhtxV686aa	i don't think it'd matter on the breed.<br>  it would matter how it acts toward a person while on your steps.<br>  and basically that could be any breed if you train it to do so.|`|7ciDto6Daa	Either a rottweiler, Siberian Husky, Doberman.<br>  Pretty much any dog over 50 pounds, would do the trick.|`|i7WJdKUqaa	i hate these dogs cause they are mean and evil but they r good for scaring.....pitbull the scariest dog evaaaaa or german shepard they are great guard dogs|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	neapolitan mastiff, french mastiff......mastiffs in general....|`|J3weIM2qaa	a pitbull because they are usually territorial and protective. or a rottweiler because they are loyal and want to protect their owner. |`|svdRml30aa	bull massive for sure.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	People who say any dog are just plain stupid!

e81798cdc9a02390c2d954fdf61adf15aa	So I have questions before I can give you an appropriate answer.  <br>  <br>  What type of filtration do you have?  If it is mechanical (box filter, power filter), then the lady at the pet shop was right on target.<br>  <br>  If you have an undergravel filter, you would have better luck at keeping livebearers (such as mollies and guppies).  Undergravel filters provide biological filtration.  I know that many power filters claim to be filtering biologically, but it simply is NOT the same as true biological filtration which takes place in an undergravel filter which is properly maintained.<br>  <br>  Egglayers are much more hardy than the livebearers and that is why she gave you the advice she did.<br>  <br>  Happy to see that there is a pet store giving good advice!<br>  *************************<br>  <br>  Well, 7.4 gallons is a very small place for an undergravel filter.  I would never use bacteria from the pet store for the tank.  You can let it cycle naturally for your fish.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you have the right set-up, although small.  Start small.  I wouldn't even recommend starting with the pleco.  They are kind of sensitive to the ammonia cycle that you will be going through.

I would not suggest the guppies if you are housing the betta in the tank also. <br>  <br>  get a new filter, UG filters are, as said above, outdated. adding bacteria will do nothing, bacteria is in the tank when established and stuff you buy from petstores is pretty much dead and useless. instead, do a fishless cycle so as not to endanger your fish:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles/misc/fishlesscycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles...</a>|`|614f441d409d6912be8c96b43fdac75daa	I'm inclined to agree with at least the mollies being excluded, who prefer hard water at a high ph with slight salinity and cool temps. <br>  <br>  The guppies should be fine with the same water conditions as the tetras and catfish.<br>  <br>  Your tank is really too small for much of anything, especially since you are picking schooling fish.|`|oaUelbqKaa	Your tank is too small for most catfish (except for maybe pygmy corys), mollies, or a bristlenose.

A buddy for your dog will not fix his loneliness- you will just have two lonely dogs instead of one. The companionship your dog wants and craves is yours. I admire your idea of rescuing the dalmation, but your Dobie needs all your attention for the first year of his life. Once he is fully trained with good manners and social skills, introducing a new dog to your home may be a good idea. Dalmations are extremely high energy dogs, and require a ton of attention. I have a Queensland female that is 50 lbs., and a lab mix that is 110 lbs- she is much more of a handful than her big "brother". In another 6 months to a year, you can find a dog to rescue that will be a good fit for your family, and a friend to your Dobie forever.|`|cL0aHkYEaa	Dogs do enjoy the company of other dogs.  But read up on the breed you are thinking of choosing.  Dalmations require TONS of exercise!
F8xVu2Yqaa	Personally, I am partial to African Cichlids from Tanganyika and Malawi. Some can get fairly large and you can see individual personalities in them. Just get them in singles so they don't fight and don't feed them live food. They are also pretty hardy as long as you keep the tank circulating and aerated. My hap venustis is larger than my hand and my lamp lelupis are just a little smaller than my fingers. Everything else is in between those size-wise.|`|fBYInMlNaa	You can get 2 oscars, which are cichlids.  They can get to be like 14 inches.|`|uLYlQMs3aa	African Cichlids are defiantly a good choice. These fish are beautiful in color for non marine. I am also a fan of Discus which to some are a difficult fish to keep, however I did not think so. Either way do your research in advance and remember 1 " of fish per gallon ( non metric ) lol. This is total full grown size!<br>  So good luck and have fun!!|`|o7lRarJqaa	I have a 300 gallon African Cichlid tank....I perfer the Haps and Peacocks....more color and less aggresive!<br>  As far as Oscars....they need 50 gallons of water a piece and either one....or more than 6 to get along.
GP1P1w5Maa	Why don't you try to show you mom that you are responsible enough to take care of the cat while it is still outside?  <br>  <br>  Provide it with water and food that you buy with your allowance.<br>  <br>  Set up a small sheltered area for it outside.<br>  <br>  Do you know if the cat is "fixed"?  If not ask your mom to help you find a shelter or clinic that will "fix" the cat for you.<br>  <br>  Same thing with vaccinations.  Find out if your community offers a free rabies vaccine, and if not, find a vet who will do it for you, and offer to pay for the shot with your own money.<br>  <br>  If the cat has an eye problem, you should take it to see a vet anyway.  Again you should offer to pay or at least help pay the bill.<br>  <br>  If can you do all of that, which will take time and commitment on your part, your mom should see that you are ready to take on that sort or responsibility.|`|bdpcfkMWaa	Ask her what has been the nicest thing she has done in a while? Then tell her you can top it. And look at the cat. You might want to get the money together that it would take to care for the cat and show your mother you really mean it. i,g, food, supplies, toys, kitty litter box, cat litter, etc,etc.|`|zr10Hvtbaa	this kitty may just have a cold. tell your mom how much ya love him and how much you want your home to be his. then promise mom extra household duties in order for kitty to see a vet. he needs his eye looked at.not sure about the eye problem but the vet bill may be one of the reasons she is hesitant.|`|cOnEkyKBaa	Have a long talk with your mom. Promise to take good care of the cat. If she still doesn't want it, try and convince her to help you take the kitten to the humane society.<br>  ==|`|pUJfK8xLaa	What exactly is your question?|`|F08HDRvraa	Promise to take care of the kitty (includes litter box duties) and show her my answer. If she let's you keep the kitty, you have to feed it and change it's box, which is a nasty job, so make sure you are willing to do so before you beg her for the kitty.To mom, I have taken in several different cats over the years, some were given to me by people and some were strays.  By far, the strays ended up being sweeter, easier to litter train (because they are used to going potty outside)less picky about their food and just all around good pets.|`|b4YX72hBaa	Tell her what you just said.  You love it and you are willing to take on the responsibility of caring for it.  Call your local vet and ask if they have any special arrangements for strays.  Sometimes vets will cut you a deal for the initial visit for a stray.  If you do get the kitty make sure you get it spayed! |`|HkMhWvtgaa	Even before the kitten comes into the house, you can show your mother that you are responsible enough to care for him by giving him all the care you can, even while he lives out on the porch.  Do you have money of your own, either from a job or an allowance?  Use it to buy cat food and two dishes (one for food, one for water).  Feed and water the kitten every day.  Call a vet and ask what it would cost to have the kitten at least examined.  Can you pay at least half of the cost?  The fact that you are willing to make this sacrifice may convince your mom to pay the rest, and make this kitten part of your family.<br>  <br>  Good luck to all of you!|`|EaeEVGZyaa	It is kind of you to want to help the kitten. Now you must sit down with your mother and discuss the facts like a responsible person.<br>  <br>  1. Can the family afford to take in a cat with a physical problem that could cost many hundreds of dollars?<br>  2. Can the family afford good quality cat food, litter, litter box, vet's visits for inoculations, spaying or neutering, and licensing?<br>  3. What will you do to help?  Will you feed it every morning and evening?<br>  Clean out the litter box at least once a day? Train it? Contribute to the cost of keeping it? Administer medicine? Groom it daily? Play with it daily? Vacuum the fur off the furniture? Clean up vomit and hairballs?<br>  <br>  Today's economy makes it harder to be a responsible pet owner. I hope all works out well for the kitten.|`|IK06GyN7aa	It's admirable that you think of a less fortunate animal. Usually when a mother animal abuses or neglects its young, they since something is wrong, so they abandon it. <br>  <br>  My friend feeds several stray cats and their kittens. She took one in that was sick and took her to the vet. The kitten had a cold and an eye infection. Today KieKie is a healthy 2 year old with the run of the house. She stays a lot on the sun porch and plays with the others through the window.|`|IkmgDWECaa	If you tell your mom you will take care of it entirely,if you will, maybe she will consider it. I think it would be very kind for you to take care of it. By the way you described it, I think it is adorable! But then you have to take it to the vet and help its eye. Try to get your mom to let you, you never know...
cL0aHkYEaa	Ditto another vet.  If she doesn't seem to want to drink water, try chicken broth diluted with water or diluted with pedialyte.  Spoon feed her this liquid if you must.  Or use one of the plastic syringes for administering liquid medication.  A little at frequent intervals--maybe a teaspoon or so every 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  Sending her and you good thoughts and prayers!|`|VY5k2PEJaa	I'd be taking her to another vet quick smart.  A high temperature of 104 is extremely dangerous and could signify the onset of a dreadful disease, an infection or some sort of virus.  Make sure she is kept hydrated and doesn't dehydrate.|`|YuTFG3feaa	Did the vet even give you a diagnoses or run any tests (blood work, etc) to determine the cause of the fever?  Were you given any meds for the fever and explained to what they are for?  If you were given antibiotics, sometimes they can take up to 72 hours to get into your dogs system real good.  If it has been this long and/or your pets condition is worsening, get her to another reputable vet ASAP.  It doesn't necessarily have to be parvo.  People tend to automatically assume when a young dog gets sick, it's parvo and panic.  It could be something as simple as an ear or bladder infection. Sounds like you have a lot of open ends where this vet is concerned.  I would do a little research on the area vets and carefully chose one.  If it makes you feel any better, I have a 8 year old Rotty and they are very "hearty" dogs.  Good luck on getting your baby properly diagnosed and well.  |`|Ytu9ItaMaa	find a different vet.......soak a towel in cool water and drape it over her....|`|rBCQBHSHaa	Take her to another vet. |`|dWed21jUaa	Get her to a different vet ASAP!|`|Xc4c1ym1aa	If the vet gave you antibiotics it could take a few days for a fever to go down. Call the vet again and ask about expected recovery time. If they think there are complications they will set up another appointment to see her.|`|jRTNTO0Laa	PARVO
NAGiNKFWaa	I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak of|`|ixFbNr4taa	I have the same answer for all the potty training questions.  <br>  <br>  Crate-training, serious crate training. <br>  <br>  You did not say how old your dog is -- Puppy or adult dog? Male or Female?  Spay or Neuter - that HELPS!!  Make a commitment to one method (crate-training) and stick to a schedule without fail. You have to do it regularly, like clockwork, 24/7 period. Period. There will be periods of play time for your dog but when you can not DIRECTLY supervise it - your pup will be in his/her crate.  <br>  <br>  Remember - There's an old saying -- "A Tired dog is a happy dog (and has a happy owner"). So, I'd also begin a basic obedience class - you would be surprised how physically & mentally draining obedience classes can be. So, start training obedience and that will naturally assist your potty-training efforts.  I am guessing that you have a puppy -- so, I would not expect any results for 3-4 months.  Dachshunds (especially minis) can be notoriously hard to house-break.  <br>  <br>  Go to this website (It's really a PDF -- it has a bunch of schedules for dogs of different ages and levels of potty-training. It's Great! But, you've got to make the commitment for your little pal to do this. Commit for 4 weeks. Then commit for another 4 weeks, and so on until your pup is fully house-broken. Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ltah.net/Housebreaking.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ltah.net/Housebreaking.pdf</a><br>  <br>  The schedules are great!!! Follow one of them to the LETTER!!! |`|zOZs7qqGaa	 If its and older dog, neutering the dog will probablyy cure it, my dog peed on the curtains to mark his territory, it wasterriblee and I had to get him neutered, something I really did not want to do as I feel it being most unfair to such thing, but I had noChoicee.<br>  <br>  If its a puppy you can buy training pads, but newspaper will do just as well,every timee he pees elsewhere, pick him up and put him on the pad. Sometimes its useful to keep the puppy in the kitchen with lots of newspaper on the floor, ones he's done it on the pad or paper you make a fuss of him , what a clever boy he is and give him a treat.

I can help|`|9dOfxwuIaa	She needs to go to a vet. Cats who stop using the litterbox are often sick.  She could be diabetic, or have a UTI. |`|C9R7GFCUaa	Vet visit is in order. Your cat might have UTI or be diabetic, which is very serious.|`|9f7292c3270df51eb281378313276e5daa	You know that's actually serious.  I had a cat that did that and it turned out to be some sort of feline schizophrenia.|`|2iqBP8cLaa	Drinking that much water and heavy urination could also be indicative of kidney disease.  I'd take the cat to the vet and get a blood panel to check for kidney and liver values.  There is special food for kidney disease (Prescription k/d).  She also may have hypercalcemia.  The treatment they gave me for that for my cat was giving Sub-Q fluids every other day.  Her hypercalcemia is gone now!  (Hypercalcemia can cause kidney disease and kidney disease can cause hypercalcemia).  There are always kitty diapers!  How old is the cat?|`|cOnEkyKBaa	Try another vet. The one you went to is obviously missing something. With that massive infusion of water, and the attendant behavioral problems, I suspect there is something seriously wrong. Diabetes has been mentioned - a good possibility, but I'd be more inclined to think that there's a major kidney problem going on.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hate losing cats more than just about anything.<br>  <br>  ==|`|6ZglXmzaaa	to get the smell away use viniger mixed with h2o. Then bye some animal stuff that keeps them away from a certain spot u may find these at Wal Mart. To make her stop peing on in your house find some frsh pee and stick her nose in it. Repeat this every time she does this and most likly she will start goin in hher litter box.|`|AA12161533	Okay so the cat is getting older and is used to outdoors. Maybe she has Bladder issues because of age, maybe she has to get used to the indoor environment, or maybe she has feline diabetes.  Take her to the vet for a full examination. 
C9R7GFCUaa	It sounds like he just having bad dreams when he's in deep sleep. He had a hard life for the first 4 years, that will take him a while to get over. I would suggest not to touch him while he is in that state of sleep and give him lots of love that he deserves. He will get over it and it is only because of his past puppy mill life. |`|AA10409800	Ok, I have to admit I was distracted by your actual story and question, because I was fixated on your title.  That sounds like a really bad B movie horror flick...one that I'd like to see.<br>  <br>  "In a sleepy little remote town in rural Nevada, a horrible nuclear experiment goes wrong.

Poor thing My dog will freak sometimes at night when shes sleeping in her cage to! She does not bite but she growls and flairs about.. We just think shes dreaming when shes doing it but this is a good question! I am going to mark that interesting!|`|RPp3WVOnaa	Waking your dog when he is in a deep sleep may just be startling him and he reacts the only way he can, with biting and growling.  Could be because he was a puppy mill stud that he was mistreated during his tenure as a stud and easily gets startled when sleeping due to something that may have happened to him.  My dog will lash out in a deep sleep when he is on his couch in front of the window.  I would just leave him alone when he is in a deep sleep on the bed and only pet him/touch him when he isnt so comatose :)  Animals are unique arent they?  Best Wishes!|`|556b0d919821bf9bcdfa818aa9e7debaaa	He may have experienced abuse before coming to you and is a little "troubled".   I adopted a puppy who used to wet the bed at night.  (Never heard of that before!) but he eventually grew out of it thank goodness.   Try conditioning him by very slowly petting him and talking to him each night.  Eventually maybe his subconscious mind will be at ease.|`|49516892a30256a05c73d42ba16ec24eaa	He's obviously startled out of a deep sleep. In a puppy mill situation it may have been the common response for him. Be glad you don't have more issues and good luck.|`|AZCtkVmtaa	He most likely was treated badly and learned to defend himself right out of a deep sleep when he was most vulnerable. Only time will teach him he is safe with you. Dogs in those places were often treated like sacks of meat and he may have been hit, grabbed, or otherwise injured while in a deep sleep so I would just give him time and work on building his confidence but he may never fully recover. |`|2rysVM1Daa	Yeah, maybe it's a subconscious issue of previous abuse and neglect.<br>  <br>  Just make sure to keep your hands and feet away from him when he's in that state.|`|KdktWImBaa	My 8 year old poodle does that at night. I think it might have something to do with the people who raised him. I acquired my little man when he was being passed around from home to home and I fell in love with him. Anyway, one of his many homes had a couple teenage boys that liked to pick at him to get a reaction. So I think that's probably where it came from. He also hates for his rump to be touched. I had another poodle that did this too, but she was 14 years old and had bad arthritis so I think that's why. But almost every time, after my heart starts beating again from being attacked and woken up, I have to let out a chuckle..lol
ynEdpoj8aa	Did they do their homework and read the instructions?|`|VYjERUo9aa	chihuahua's have a high c-section rate, and if not done right the dog can die. You cannot make dogs mate. There is a certain time where a female will allow the male to mount her, and this can be only 1-2 times a year. This certain time is when the female is in her heat cycle. The heat cycle is generally 3 weeks, though it varies between breeds, The female is generally most fertile during the 2nd week. If you did not know any of this then you should not even attempt breeding. Also If you have not had your dogs tested to see if they are good candidates then again, don't try. I have a golden retriever and I am by no means a breeder, we got our dog bred being that both her and the stud had champions in the line. Even though we are no experienced, I did a lot of research and now I know a lot. Again I do not know much but the owner of the stud knows more so we are doing this responsibly where you are not.|`|r7I7FoNMaa	We suggest you have your dogs spayed and neutered.  There are millions of dogs including chihuahuas killed in shelters because there are too many dogs and not enough homes.  <br>  <br>  Please do not think the female needs a litter to be a good dog.  Both dogs will live longer and healthier lives if they are spayed and neutered.<br>  Perhaps they know this since they are not breeding.|`|vCVvXsZVaa	It's been said already, but this is a really bad idea. First consider that you have 2 pet quality chis. I assume neither have been shown at all, let alone received any points toward a major. There are many issues that chis are prone to, and you must have them both tested to make sure they don't pass any genetic or congenital defects to their progeny. They must be at least 2 years old (both of them) & you should know the breed standard well enough to know at a glance if they are perfect representations of that standard. You need to know everything there is to know about prenatal care & exercise, whelping & both routine & emergent care of the newborns. You have to be prepared to care for the pups around the clock for weeks in the event that your maiden ***** rejects the litter or dies during whelping. Prenatal vet exams alone will cost you in the neighborhood of $500. In the likely event that your ***** needs a c-section, it's an additional $800 for a scheduled section and at least twice as much for an emergency one. Taking into consideration that it's more common than not for a ***** to only produce 1 or 2 pups in a first litter, you will be losing a lot of money after you vet the pups. I haven't even mentioned the cost of the whelping supplies & they can be considerable. I hope you do a lot more research on your own before even considering this. Yahoo Answers is not the place to get informed advice about everything you will need to know. I would recommend contacting your local breed group & asking for a mentor. If he or she agrees that your dogs are worthy of breeding in the first place, they will recommend showing them first & this way you will know you are breeding champions, not just another litter of poorly bred chis.<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  My bad, I'm guessing you're a troll since no sane person who's pregnant by someone other than her bf would choose to try & breed dogs at the same time|`|S5Lz35myaa	If you're serious - get them neutered/spayed and enjoy them as they are and non puppy making machines<br>  <br>  If you're a troll, which I assume you are, get a life.|`|iLrp65oXaa	Please don't.<br>  <br>  If you don't know anything about breeding chihuahuas you shouldn't be doing it.<br>  <br>  |`|7a0b8d7dd5636ea72eeaaf763882e180aa	spay your female, pregnancy can and does KILL female chiahuas, this is NOT a breed to just breed willy nilly...|`|2c296a8ede3071a65437281f5d6568a3aa	Don't feed the troll|`|Gnzeq3f2aa	Sorry but if you have to ask this question then you shouldn't breed. |`|9Ozu6kcOaa	Go buy some stuffed dogs.. the world doesn't need any more live ones!|`|EhtIZxcsaa	Yawn....troll elsewhere. <br>  <br>  I hear the that religion section is slow tonight..try there|`|OKiMkaxGaa	Are you willing to spend over $1000 on an emergency C-section which most chi's require? Are you willing to see the mom and her babies die? Are they both champions and have been tested for various diseases? Are they "teacups"? Are you willing to volunteer at a shelter because the homes that your pups go to are now longer going to a shelter dog so they will be forced to be euthanized? <br>  |`|ITnQEUQTaa	Only one suggestion - get them speyed and neutered!!|`|0a14Mg2kaa	good lord, you are naive.   Do you think that dogs were invented by people?<br>  <br>  I feel like I have to ask...you do have one male and one female, right?  Neither one of them is spayed/neutered, right?<br>  <br>  If that is the case, you don't have to do anything, as they are quite capable of working it out for themselves, once the female goes into heat.|`|ydshiNrKaa	You can't make dogs mate unless the female is in heat.  If you don't know this, then you are better off not breeding your dogs.  Please have your dogs fixed and stop adding to the already overpopulation of pets.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	Just dont do it PLEASE!  <br>  Breeding dogs is complicated, expensive, and time consuming and there are alot of risks involved.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	Fix them. We don't need more dogs bred by people who don't know what they're doing.
RRzUfvwXaa	If I had to choose I would take the puppy. They will be more work and training, but they will prove to be the better pet in the long run :)|`|YoZZDqq9aa	PUPPY!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Puppies will respond to you. Ginea Pigs will tolerate you.<br>  Puppies will love you. Ginea Pigs will put up with you.<br>  Puppies can be trained. Ginea Pigs eat, sleep, walk, and poop.<br>  Puppies will play with you. Ginea Pigs can't be bothered.<br>  Puppies will live about 15 years. Ginea Pigs might live about 18 mos.|`|Zv4tZ0tZaa	Each have their points, Guinea Pigs are fairly inexpensive to keep and don't require much maintenance besides cleaning their cage once a week or so and to be handled. The problem with guinea pigs is that they are VERY stupid animals. I personally prefer rats as pets to a guinea pig if for the simple reason that they can be trained to hold their bodily functions while you hold them. They can also be trained to do little tricks. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, puppies become dogs. It takes a lot of time and effort to turn a puppy into a well mannered dog. There is house breaking, walks, vet visits, basic training, etc. The thing that that a dog can provide that a guinea pig can't is a constant companion as they can't be allowed to roam the house because it is unsanitary and unsafe. <br>  <br>  Overall, it depends on what type of pet you are looking for. Are you looking for a companion that requires a lot of time and effort or are you looking for a pet that doesn't demand as much attention. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would prefer a dog or a rat. I really dislike guinea pigs because they are unsanitary critters that pee and poop all over you when you hold them.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	hard question.......i have had them both......the guinea pigs i.ve had have always been so adorable and affectionate and pretty easy to care for.......but i.d probably prefer a puppy because it can interact with me more......as in going hiking and on walks.........riding in the car.............and not having to keep such a close eye on it as you would have to w/an uncaged guinea pig......|`|xKl3cKB8aa	I would choose a puppy. Dogs are very loyal animals. They do not suit everyone but they adapt well to any environment. Guinea pigs are really different from dogs though. Never kept a guinea pig. It really depends on your budget and how much time you have. Cheers.
qioH81tiaa	No.  She is teething, and so her ears may be wonky for a while.  But, the way her ears are is the way her ears are - don't try to "make" them do anything!|`|3zv2bbolaa	Some breeders and exhibitors will glue ears while the dog is teething, but I have never seen anyone successfully resolve prick ears back to a button set once they stand. |`|iJtuhLMTaa	No,  as Ko Aussie said some breeders/owners of breeds that are suppose to be floppy glue or tape while teething, as the ears do funny things during teething. However if she is holding them erect all the time chances are she is is suppose to be erect eared.  Some dogs ears don't stand until later so their is a good chance your dog is just suppose to be a naturally erect eared dog.  |`|nEjeAUmqaa	what type of dog do u have first of all..if it is a Shepherd or any other dog breed that has natural pointed ears then no they will be up like that for life, but if it is just a phase she is going through like teething then give it time and they will fall back down.there is no vet that will do a reverse cropping, that wouldn't be possible as when a dogs ear is cropped half the ear is taken away and stitched together so it will stand straight up..|`|369751a0b123b26964f08327b9519126aa	no do not do this. it's not allowed anymore at least where i'm from because it's cruel. let it be the way nature made it.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	ummmmm...no...and wow.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	haha!!!!

8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It probably means impacted anal glands.  Take her to the vet and find out for sure.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Vet.|`|OKiMkaxGaa	Vet-it may not be worms-she could also have impacted anal glands. Whatever it is it is uncomfortable, please get her to the vet as soon as possible (though not an emergency).|`|q8ApQdZ5aa	We see three common causes of "scooting" or dragging the bottom along rough surfaces.<br>  <br>  The first is impacted anal sacs. While many dogs can express their anal sacs by dragging their rectum along the ground it is quicker to express them manually. Many vets will show owners how to do this if asked.<br>  <br>  The second is tapeworm infestation. Tapeworms release muscular segments that exit the rectum and move around spreading tapeworm eggs into the environment. These appear to cause pretty severe itching in some dogs. They can usually be seen in the stool or haircoat when they first exit the rectum as small (1/2 to 3/4th inch) moving objects. If they are missed in the active stage, they dry up and look like rice granules stuck in the hair around the rectum.<br>  <br>  The last is allergic disease -- flea allergy being the most common allergy leading to itching around the base of the tail and rectal region.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Could be worms or it could be her anal glands need expressed.  Best to take her to the vet for a check up along with a stool sample.|`|qeeem2giaa	my dog will die before i wipe his ***.|`|eCWuBxSZaa	It's possible. We had a chihuahua that dragged his butt on the carpet. We couldn't afford a vet at the time.<br>  I would take her to the vet and get a confirmation whether it's worms or not.

Hope that helps|`|0O3EIQHzaa	Take her to the vet but I would wash her butt and put some vasoline on her anus and wait a day - often it is just irratiation and goes away the next day BUT... dragging butt or scouting can mean a lot of things, worms, coccidia, constipation so if it continues then off to the vet :-)|`|dKGHV3jkaa	my dog drags his butt on the floor when he has poop stuck on his butt. i didnt think to go to the vet because he only does it when there poop on it. check to see if that is the problem |`|Ytu9ItaMaa	could mean she has worms.....could also mean she has a problem with her anal glands.....you should take her to the vet so you can get the right diagnosis.........|`|rwD6XlQJaa	Have you ever not scratched an itch? I think it can be the glands or worms or just plain needing a rub down. |`|TXQoSigqaa	She probably does have worms...I would take her to the vet to make sure though :)|`|6f6476f5c8f8084f513542ec513bcbb8aa	maybe he has an itchy butthole
vvWXajKvaa	Maybe he was poisoned?|`|gwUMipsUaa	Dachshund.<br>  <br>  Could be anything.  You can take him to the vet for an autopsy.|`|024lJBZ4aa	If his body was swollen, it could have very well been bloat.  Bloat is where the stomach fills with air and then twists.  If your not home to see it and get the dog to the vet, the dogs die without medical attention, which usually involves a pretty comlicated surgery.<br>  <br>  Bloat is very common in the large deep chested breeds like Standard Poodles, Great Danes, German Shepherds etc, but it is also common in Beagles and Dachshunds, both deep chested breeds.<br>  <br>  |`|RqeoCyzYaa	i would have a autopsy performed on your dog from the vet. to see what the cause was and if this poor dog was poisoning. i would find the bastards and make their life a living hell.sorry for the using bad words but this really upsets me.|`|wseWiC4Gaa	Neighbors probably poisoned him, start asking questions.|`|S02hlmlLaa	It kinda sounds like he ate something that made him sick, or possible choking? Poison? something outside ?|`|M8X0dIOZaa	Awe, how aweful! Dochshunds are very high strung dogs. Something could have scared him terribly, or he may have injested some kind of poison. Only an autopsy could find out for sure or a search of your house/appartment. His body being swolen and stiff is typical for just a few hours after death regardless of the cause of death. It happens in humans too as well as any animal. I'm not sure I could confidently explain the biology of it but it has to do with blood pooling once the heart stops beating and temperatures above 70 degrees F. Muscles also become rigid just minutes after death... that's part of rigimortis. So sorry for your loss.|`|d3c2f00d59b92ece3225187fb2320c80aa	Sorry to here about your dog. This sounds similar to what had happened to one of my pets. She was all swollen up, kinda of blown up but she was bleeding out of her nose not mouth. We were told that she might of eaten some rat Poison or some kind of poison. Which might of caused your dogs death. Do you have rat poison around your house? Maybe you neighbors have some poison to get rid of the rats.|`|SOrOmKr9aa	It sounds like poison, probably rat poison; I would contact local animal control and possibly even the police for an investigation.|`|12a857dfddfe2c9b58b8d2662b0fc713aa	That's horrible. I would call a Vet first thing. They can give you a clearer answer before you start blaming anyone for anything. |`|lN1PPesTaa	Well maybe he ate lots and lots of food and then DRANK WATER which will clog the food all up together and then his stomach would burst. I think that this it it. Seriously.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	sounds like he might have been poisoned.....maybe by neighbors annoyed by his barking......
SLSX6QQsaa	Could be many things, but I am going to take a guess.  I think it may be the food you are feeding them.  I have found that most of the cheaper brands are crap.  Even Fancy Feast and the better of the cheap brands still seem to be crappy.  I have had a cat for 4 years, and last year got another.  I was feeding my cat Meow Mix and also 9 Lives canned food.  My original cat was a little overweight, about 10 pounds but he has a little frame.  My new kitty threw up immediately, and I though it would just take adjusting, but she never did.  She threw up at least 3 times a week for a few months.  I decided to try a new food. I got Iams Lamb and Rice, AKA digestive care, and also available as just Iams Lamb and Rice canned food too.  Within a week, my new kitty stopped throwing up :)  And after 4 months, I took both of them to the vet for shots and my original kitty lost 2 pounds :)  The vet was happy, he looks much more fit and healthy these days :)  I really believe in that food, its fab.|`|9nrJM0c2aa	If they are really hungry, they sometimes eat way too fast.  I free-feed my cats (I know...naughty...not good for them...but I have my reasons).   Sometimes, I wake up and they are "starving", as their dish is empty.  When I feed them, they tend to eat WAY too much WAY too fast and end up vomiting.<br>  <br>  However, you may want to check with your vet for an opinion and reassess what you're feeding them.  Hairball meds also can assist in preventing such things, if hairballs are the issue contributing to the vomiting.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  |`|pqnHuKS4aa	Take your cats to the vet and have them examined.  Might be the food or it might be the location of the food.  For instance, if you give them wet food but leave it outside in the heat, the sun and flies might get them sick.  Or they could just have a bug in them.|`|Ytu9ItaMaa	try a different foodl.......maybe one for sensitive stomachs.....|`|AA11736670	Try giving them hairball treatment you buy at the store.|`|ei9jnZEeaa	Some brands do that.

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Is this a behavioural problem or a health issue with her?  If she has always peed in the house it's behavioural. If it's recent then take her back to the vet for appropriate medication.  If it's behavioural, don't wait for her to indicate she needs to go out, take her out on a regular schedule.<br>  I wouldn't consider euthanizing a dog for peeing in the house when there are workable solutions.<br>  <br>  By the way, putting her nose is it is not a puppy thing.  It's a cruel action carried out by people who don't know any better and it doesn't work. What does work is training.|`|871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	Doggie diapers.  But umm.. . she won't understand why you stuck her nose in the pee or puppy pad.  That will make no sense to her.  If you use puppy pads, you don't stick their nose in it.  When she uses the puppy pad, you move another puppy pad towards the door that opens into the yard.  When she uses that puppy pad, you keep moving the pads to the door.  Then move the pad outside.  You praise her for peeing outside and give her a treat.  She could have a bladder infection.  If you haven't tested for that already, test for that.  Also, kidney problems can cause incontinence.|`|BkXfROaEaa	The best thing to do is to keep your dog in a cage for a couple hours then let him outside.  After you do this repeatedly your dog should stand at the door when they need to use the restroom.|`|Ipv3WoIcaa	Is your dog dominate over you and your family? cause if it is it could be that she is marking her territory and that still could be it other wise she could have crystals in her urine which one of my cats has and he is on some medicaine but it doesnt always work the other thing is you can always crate her until she figures it out but that most likely wont work cause you never use a crate as punishment it is there to be thought of as a happy place or den when the "pack/pack" leader leaves.<br>  <br>  And always make sure you arent yelling at her for it UNLESS you catch her in the act other wise don't know what they are being yelled at for and will start to fear you when you yell.<br>  <br>  So the next time you are at the vet I would ask him/her to check your dogs urine for crystals.<br>  <br>  If you need anything else just email me. it should be in my profile.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
hWc65sEtaa	Continue to crate train.  She is getting use to her new home.  The training will get better the longer you do it.  Try staying out a little longer when you go for walks.  They should always go outside at least once before you bring them back in. This teaches them to potty outside.  Also, when she goes inside, make sure you tell in a firm voice NO.  She still is a puppy and it does take some time to learn new things.  Consistency is the best way.  Good luck.|`|Ipv3WoIcaa	Every dog will bark and cry at first in the crate you can't let her out or say anything other wise you are telling her that the behavior she is doing is okay and you want it. leave her in there and ignore her it will be hard and sad. but do it and once she stops barking and crying for 30 secs let her out give her a treat and then repeat with the time being longer.<br>  <br>  Or you can try by once you close the door to make sure you have some treats ready so she understands that it is nothing to fear and that treats are coming and tell her for not crying or barking that she is good always tell the dog when they do what you want they are good.<br>  <br>  It does take time and is sometime frustrating but it will have to be done everyday for a while.<br>  <br>  When she goes to the bathroom in the house stick her nose it AS LONG AS YOU CATCH HER DOING IT!! then put her outside and don't bring her back in until she goes to the bathroom outside. and then reward her with treats and a petting. And when you catch her pick her up and stick her nose in it right away then outside don't let her finish.|`|bgs7Bvkoaa	You need to take her out every time she wakes up, after a feed & before you put her in her crate, she should not be left more than 2 hours without being taken outside.
