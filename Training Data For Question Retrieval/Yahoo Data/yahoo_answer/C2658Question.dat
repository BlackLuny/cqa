20060813202154AAAcED2	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog whine when she fetches stuffed toys?	My boyfriend and I just adopted an 8 year old Golden Retreiver from the pound. We don't know anything about how she was trained. She loves to play fetch with tennis balls and she doesn't make any noise when she goes to get them. Whenever she goes to fetch something stuffed she whines all the way to it until she has it in her mouth but she wags her tail and seems happy to go get it. She picks it up very gently and then brings it back. My inital thought was that it had something to do with hunting, but I'm not sure. Help would be appreciated because I don't want to distress her. Thanks!

I was sitting on the couch when my crazy pitt bull walked up to the couch and stuck his head between the cushions, trying to get something.  he couldn't reach it, so he stepped back, stared at me, and starting crying and yelping.  I got up and asked him what he wanted and he just stared at the couch.  so I went behind the couch, tilted it forward.  he reached under the couch, ate a runt and was happy.

Ces animaux lorsqu'ils sont prélevés dans la nature (je ne parle pas de ceux issus d'élevages qui permettent aussi de préserver l'espèce) sont "morts" et ne jouent plus leurs r?les dans la cha?ne alimentaire.

Everytime we see the cat we run outside and chase him off.  I have tried calling him to me to catch him, but as soon as he sees us he takes off.  My mom has tried spraying the hose when he comes, but nothing stops this bully.  We have 5 cats, and 2 are very old and docile, and he even gets in fights with them!  He is causing actual harm to our cats, lots of battle wounds.    I really dont want to have to drive to the other streets, and go door to door... he could be coming from anywhere! I dont know what we should do... A couple years ago we set a cage out for a stray (it was not an inhumane one) and caught a skunk! So we cant do that... What can we do????

I walk him two miles a day and we play and have discipline throughout the day so I know it is not an anxiety issue just a puppy figuring out that attention is attention whether negative or positive.

20090205015045AAXhSM3	Pets;Dogs	Why don't people spay and neuter their cats & dogs? when there are so many programs to help them do just that?	So they spend less or even nothing to spay or neuter.   Should they pass state laws requiring all dogs over a year be fixed? Except breeders animals?   We have a rescue dog who we just brought home a few weeks ago and is extremely tiny and we had her spayed today. Before we got her she had 9 puppies. Her uterus split during surgery and she almost died because of having so many pregnancies and pups.   They said if she would have gotten pregnant again she would have died.    Why do people not realize they save their cats and dogs from terrible situations, unwanted pregnancies, unwanted puppies or kitties, even death.   Our little one will be all right but she has a long recovery ahead of her.   If anyone can enlighten me to why other than breeding animals are not fixed I'd like to know.    Are people just to afraid of spending the money?

20060810212336AAb9Hj3	Pets;Dogs	Cachorros, uma estranha epidemia.?	De uns  anos para cá, ocorreu um estranho fen?meno, dificil de explicar. De forma acelerada, Um número incalculável de pessoas come?ou a criar cachorros. Pet shop se tornou um dos negócios mais rentáveis dos últimos anos (para quem entende do ′negócio, claro).    Todos os dias, caminhando pela ruas, encontramos gente passeando com seu caozinho (mesmo que seja uma cachorr?o, pesando 200 quilos, seu dono o chama de cachorrinho). As mulheres chamam os dogs de filhinhos, os homens se intitual seus tios. E assim por diante.    Por outro lado, a quantidade de fezes espalhadas pelas vias públicas, também aumentou proporcionalmente. Privada de cachorro é rua. E aí? Qual sua opini?o?

20090205015905AA7b0SN	Pets;Fish	What's wrong with my guppy?	My boyfriend is a big fish guy. He's never had any other pet, ever. I bought a female betta awhile ago and he's teaching me the ropes. She's doing great!       So we decided it was time for me to take my next step in becoming a real fish kinda gal...   I bought two pregnant female guppies. Currently, they are living in a large 2-3 gallon vase. (I know its not great, but we're in the middle of moving and he's flying to his parent's house to bring back his tank/equipment.)      I was concerned because after a few days they started hanging around the top. I looked that up and most sites said to change the water (lack of oxygen). In the midst of that I looked into the bowl where I had the two ladies and there was only one!      I tore through all of the boxes and finally found mine, laying at the bottom of a box I had emptied out.      After finding out she was alive, I gently picked her up and let her back into the clean water, but now she's acting strange.      She's swimming into the glass. She also has tiny little bubbles clinging to her body and fins.      It's also only been about forty-five minutes since this happened...      Basically, I would like to know WHY she jumped, why she's swimming awkwardly, and what those bubbles on her are?         **The other fish is fine. She's swimming around, doing her thing. I realize now that I have to change their current water more frequently!

20060705233152AAjiqVL	Pets;Cats	Hyper Cat DRIVING ME CRAZY?	I have a cat who is 10 months old and he is very hyper. I have had him fixed so he cant spray, but he is still very hyper. My husband and I have refused to play with him because he likes to attack out feet and hands. When he is playing with us he bites really hard. He dosen't go anywhere around our 6 month old son and at night he likes to TRY to suck on my ear. Its very weird and disgusting. I found him abandend when he was just 2 weeks old and I don't know if the sucking thing is just a comfort thing, but he is really starting to irratate me. I always spend time with him so he doesnt feel abandend because of our son. He also at night likes to run in circles in our apartment he will run from room to room for no apparent reason. He is also very neat with his litter box. ANY ADVICE????

They gave me something to put a stool sample in and bring it back. Well after we left the dogters office, a few hours later my puppy started sneezing, a lot, and now has green snot coming from the nose. I called and made another appointment for puppy charlie,which is tomorrow, but what would be causing green snot and the runs?

She wasn't eating anything, wasn't walking or moving, had a fever and lost interest in activities she used to love. My mom brought her to the hospital and she stayed there for a few days. They told my mom that she had a sist on her pancreas. Soon she started eating again, but then her eye swelled up three times its normal size! (Brain tumor?) A few days later we took her home again but she just got worse. Now she hasn't eaten in a week and my mom is gonna have to put her to sleep today unless we can find out what's wrong with her. Please help me!

He has been having diarrhea since Saturday night, and has been vomiting since Sunday morning. He hasn't eaten a bite, but is drinking a lot of water (that I always try to give him). The diarrhea is extremely runny and liquidy, and he can't hold it. He is crate trained, and pooed outside of his crate last night (like he stuck his butt up to the edge and tried to make sure the poo didnt get in the crate). He also vomited in his crate.       He's a bit lethargic, but not too bad, which is why I thought it would pass. I believe he's up to date on all of his shots, and he's young, only 2 years old. Any ideas??      I cant think of anything weird he has eaten, and I havent found any evidence of it either.
