Estos corazones no se si son de piedra o simplemente son corazònes que no laten, que no duelen, que no lloran.  Solo el tiempo hace que podamos olvidar nuestros dolores, pero no por eso nos dejan de doler. Solo con el tiempo saldremos con la vista en alto y emprenderemos el vuelo hacia el verdadero amor.  Como tu dices solo con el tiempo, pero el tiempo nos darà de èl para lograrlo???  Espero que sì  Gracias por este regalo de reflexionar juntos.<br>  La Beduina|`|d123fc6301714e68d9dd2b9b13d6ba5aaa	Despues de un tiempo aprendes todo eso.<br>  Y algunos dicen: "Todo tiempo pasado fue mejor".<br>  Y la biblia dice que no repitamos ese dicho.<br>  Por mucho tiempo, no comprendía porque la biblia decía que no lo digamos.<br>  Luego de que murio mi papa, mi madre me entregó un escrito, en el que había plasmado sus reflexiones antes de morir.<br>  Y en ese escrito (q publique en mi blog) decía que el le regalaba a Manrique (quien acu?o la frase) todo el tiempo pasado que quisiera, y el se quedaba con el presente.<br>  Apesar que dicha afirmacion, me resulto extra?a, pues para mi padre el presente podría ser muy corto, pues sabia que iba a morir de momento a otro...lo explicó de una manera que entendí muy bien.<br>  El presente era para él, el único hálito de riqueza que le quedaba, era esa riqueza y valor que significa estar vivo, de seguir creando a traves de la vida, que significo seguir imprimiendo en nosotros tantas emociones, lindas, tristes, amargas, dulces, agridulces, etc<br>  Pero mi papi no vivio de recuerdos. Hasta el ultimo segundo de su vida, enriquecio la nuestra con verdades y cosas que la vida te ense?a.<br>  Papa murio dejando una leccion de vida.<br>  Comprendi que la mejor eleccion de una persona, es vivir el presente aplicando el alma en ello, aunque signifique morir en breve.<br>  Besos!!

f5IRkoMZaa	Licurgo moderò la città dei Lacedemoni nelle istituzioni e nelle leggi (opyimis non so cos'è!) affinchè fosse reputato da tutti i Greci più degli altri autori delle leggi.Distribuì l'amministrazione della patria in maniera molto ordinata:il potere delle guerre ai re, la custodia delle leggi agli anziani, ordinò alla folla l'elezione di magistrati. Attribuì magnifici onori agli anziani, nè in altre città vi fu vecchiaia più onorata che nella città dei Lacedemoni. Divise equamente i campi tra tutti affinchè la città non fosse turbata dalla discordia tra ricchi e poveri. Ordinò che le vergini senza dote fossero condotte in matrimonio affinchè gli uomini scegliessero mogli più diligenti che ricche e limitassero con l'autorità più severa. Indusse i cittadini alla massima parsimonia... <br>  <br>  Devo andare... manca l'ultima frase!

CMQ il succo è questo.|`|EgZzavHBaa	dunque per pratolini individuare con precisione lo stile letterario nn è facilissimo in quanto varia leggermente a seconda del periodo artistico dell'autore difatti si passa da una nascita in cui c'è una forte prevalenza del carattere autobiografico un periodo di commento storico sociale durante il secondo dopoguerra e un'ultima parte dedicata alla poesia. il libro a cui ti riferisci tu dovrebbe far parte della seconda vita letteraria di pratolini infatti è stato scritto dopo al fine della 2^g.m. portando alla luce l'artista.<br>  se ti interessa precisamente collocare a quel libro delle tematiche  puo metterci denuncia del sociale, tematiche storiche e tematiche autobiografiche.<br>  tra l'altro stile e tematica nn indicano esattamente la stessa cosa quindi bisognerebbe vedere un po meglio cosa vuoi sapere<br>  Tematica: argomento <br>  stile: inquadramento in una corrente<br>  io la vedo cosi

64xQbBVeaa	In United States the reason for the child labour laws was a very much needed law when it was passed in 1938. Stating that a child must be paid minimal wage. Restricting work for children under age 16. A person must be 18 yrs. of age to work in hazardous conditions. All this was brought about because in the late 1700's and 1800's it was much cheaper for the factories and mines to pay children compared to adults. This meant more money for the companies. Often the children would be immigrants. Lowest labour available. These children would be overworked, and become ill from black lung disease. Condition would also be hazardous. Killing or deform their growth. Needless to say school would not be an option for these children. After a few attempts Congress passed this law. Many countries still do not  have child labour laws. Like many years ago in this country many children in the world still do suffer.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Throughout most of history, most children were expected to work as soon as they were old enough.  In agricultural societies, children would have been out in the fields helping as soon as they were able.  Trades and crafts, before the invention of factories,were normally carried out at home and were family affairs.  Wives and children were generally involved in the family business, whatever it was.  children were always expected to make themselves useful.<br>  <br>  The change-over to large scale production brought about by the Industrial Revolution meant that children were working long hours in factories and sweatshops, and suffering great hardship.  children were cheap to employ, and could be paid much lower wages than adults, so they were attractive to manufacturers.  Eventually, laws were passed limiting the hours that children could work, and eventually stopping them from working altogether.<br>  <br>  This meant that children became something of a luxury, nowadays we tend to think of children as an expense, whereas for most of history having children would have been considered to be an economic advantage.|`|MbaP0u6iaa	Because for most of history throughout the world, children didn’t normally go to school but worked alongside their parents at whatever jobs they were strong enough to do. For example, in peasant Europe feeding chickens and rabbits, minding the baby, scaring birds away from newly-planted crops or minding a flock of geese were all jobs that could be, and traditionally were, done by children under the age of 10. (In many European countries the dates of school terms are still dictated by agricultural needs; the summer term ends just before hay and harvest time, so that school-age children will be available to help their families at this busy season.) In the parts of Central Asia and India where carpet-making is a traditional local craft, the children would work at the family loom. <br>  <br>  Having children work in this way obviously benefited the family economically, but it also benefited the children by teaching them naturally all the skills they would need as adults. Child labour only became oppressive when:<br>  <br>  - instead of working with their own families, children were sent into factories, mines and mills to work for capitalists who had no care for their safety or wellbeing<br>  <br>  - schooling and literacy became the norm in society, so that any child who was kept away from school was thereby being deprived of vital skills and disadvantaged for their whole lives.
LSsZiPX8aa	It could be argued that the book promotes hatred between classes because of the way that it feeds in to the stereotypes of different classes. I personally believe that it is unintentional and that the author was merely using the social norms of the class types to develop his characters and setting into what would be believable...unfortunately, what is believeable and usually accurate are the stereotypes that we know (even today)|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I don't know about that. If it does promote that, then what? There has been hatred between classes. This is nothing new. <br>  Is there one world? No. <br>  <br>  Have you read the book or are you reading it? What are your thoughts so far? What do you think?

xaCfXC0saa	i thinks it's actually quite good, very deep. Although some lines don't rhyme and you should try and make all the lines have all the same amount of syllables. well done :)|`|cQSRihynaa	whos that lucky one  ]    just joking      good start have potentials keep writing|`|D9andrLFaa	you have real potential and talent.  keep writing.|`|VAjird8Gaa	Really good. I like the flow, although I think the forst line needs some seperating, probably even into it's own stanza. The rhyme scheme works,and it's very deep. Good job!

jBOHWOBtaa	Go to the site below.  It can help you get good ideas.  Register or log in so you can start stories and other stuff there!  "BookWorm" that's my name if you want to add me!    By the way, the deatils you have there are very intresting!  Awesome....!!!!!!!|`|1e61983d370911d38f0a9ec0aca74fb0aa	Everything Lawrence said is right, but I don't think it will solve your problem.    You've created a setting, you've created some characters, what you don't have is a story.    What you need is a protagonist (the main character) who has some sort of goal. Your other characters need goals too.    Then you need an antagonist who wants to stop your protagonist.    This then gives you a story with conflict, and it's the conflict that's important (I don't mean just fighting but where character goals conflict).    In fact the *antagonist* is the most important character because it is the antagonist that drives everything in your story. The bigger the antagonist, the bigger your protagonist must become to win.    Good luck.|`|M2thieHqaa	First of all, remember that the things people fought over 3,000 years ago are essentially the same things that people fight about today: love, land, drugs, power, etc. This is something that your readers can relate to, and it's vital that people can relate or empathize with your characters or they won't read your writing.    Second, the story must revolve around a common goal, or around your central characters, with every action moving toward something. This implies tension and progress, which the reader needs to feel, which will make the story easier reading.     Third, your central character must be appealing to the reader, so work on making him/her as "real" as possible. When creating a character, I imagine myself having several conversations with them, talking about things that happen in their life on a daily basis; my characters are as real as you or me.     Finally, it's fun to think about vampires, shamans, thieves, etc., but they have to follow rules or codes of conduct, otherwise they have no limits; characters without limits are no fun at all. Every villain or evil society has a code honor which rules their life, so your dark creatures must have one as well. Even the motorcycle gangs like the Hell's Angels or the Mongols have a constitution!    With rules like these, you should be able to come up with a fairly decent plot.     One final point: putting your ideas out here for everyone to see is a bad idea. Just because you can't make something work with this stuff doesn't mean other people can't, and it'd be terrible if somebody did so with your ideas.     Good luck!|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	You cant just ask for ideas , it has to come to you naturally .
6hVokZIlaa	find a chord chart on the internet  learn some scales   and learn some easy songs|`|f119152bd1437cee7c5e5e39298c2733aa	Lessons are not that expensive. I have seen them listed on craigslist for 15 dollars a lesson. Your only getting one lesson a week. If you cant afford that maybe you can work a deal with one of them where you get a lesson every other week or something along them lines    Lessons will get you where you want to be 2 times as fast and with more understanding    You could try to teach yourself. Most don't make it though. Most learn to play a few songs. If to be able to play a few songs and forced to use others tabs is what you desire, then fine  But if you really want to learn the guitar and understand it then you need more then a you tube video. You need lessons from a experienced player. If you want to understand how scales and chords work and be able to play them in any location you want , you need a teacher  I suggest you get lessons from a teacher. They are not that expensive. You will learn twice as fast and be a much better player. Instead of being told to put finger here and put finger there, that is a c chord. You will learn how chords are created and be able to make them any where on the neck you might need to make them. By getting lessons from a teacher , you can ask questions and have them answered, a teacher will notice things that need corrected and get them early before they become a problem for you.    The problem with most is, they just want to learn to play songs and most teachers want to focus on music theory, technique, and timing. The end result is by learning these things you can play most any song you wish to play and the other way, you can play "A" song    All music comes down to 3 things, Music theory, Technique, and timing. Rather you take 2 times as long to learn it on your own or you learn it twice as fast with a teacher is the question. Just cause someone else teaches you, doesnt mean you dont use it to express yourself. Remember, you are learning the foundation, not the limitations. It is learning the foundation that allows you to push the limitations|`|grjErSzgaa	http://www.jamplay.com/guitar-lessons/le...    It's better to take lessons if you can. This vid is about 20 bucks.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	there are many FREE online tutorials. search 'guitar tutorial' on youtube. there's a chanel on there called 'expert village' that has some good beginner tutorials. also, buy some books. there are some that are easier to understand than others. i suggest picking up a book called 'fret board logic'. there are SO many different books out there that you might just wanna go and spend the day at the book store and go through and see which book is easiest for you to understand. also check out ultimate-guitar.com for all your guitar needs!|`|bZud91iuaa	Go Back to the guitar shop and get yourself a tuner, This the easiest way to keep your guitar in tune.  Buy a standard Chord book.  The basic chords are G,Em,C,D.  This is a progression.  Another progression you'll need to know is C, Am, F, G.  With these two basic progressions you can play many, many songs.  The chord book will show you the fingerings.  Frets are those things on the fingerboard that are metal and look like a ladder going up the neck. You probably have inlay on the 1st,3rd,5th,7th and 9th frets and small dots on the side side corresponding to the inlays.  These help you know where you are on the neck.  Chords are made up of notes, that when played together form a chord structure.  Your chord book will explain this to you.  On sheet music the chords used to play the song are shown at the top of the line.      This is very, very basic but can get you started...then practice, practice and practice.

HIC8zeeaaa	Allora sono tutti e tre validi come libri<br>  <br>  il visconte dimezzato è il più semplice dei tre, la trama e i valori che contiene sono immediatamente percepibili, è una letturina di evasione, divertente, senza bisogno di pensarci troppo su.<br>  <br>  il barone rampante è già più complesso: fa moltissimi riferimenti alle filosofie settecentesche, all'illuminismo. E' più difficile da sondare in profondità, direi il più difficile dei tre. Comunque la trama prende sempre, e ha quel tanto di ironia che lo rende appetibile<br>  <br>  il cavaliere inesistente è quello che ti consiglio: a parte il palese divertimento durante la lettura credo che sia il più azzeccato della trilogia.

It can't be too flashy, but go farther then you normally would. Also, make sure you wear the same thing if you get a callback, or at least something similar. It helps because the director has a mental picture of you in his/her head when he first sees you, and if you have on something comepletely different, or you wear your hair way differently, then it will take the mental picture away.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  If you have a headshot, it might be good to wear the same thing you wore in it. Just a suggestion : )|`|VPn5QQClaa	Wear a nice tee(not like button up) and some stretchy flexible like yoga pants.... Im  a guy I dont know much... sry
1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	There are a few books with the same title - is this the one you're looking for?<br>  "Dead Reckoning:  A Pirate Voyage With Captain Drake by Laurie Lawlor<br>  "At 15, Emmet Drake is essentially shanghaied by his elder cousin, Francis Drake, to serve as page aboard the Pelican, later renamed the Golden Hind. he expedition, billed as a trading trip, stretches into more than a year of wretched deprivation, piracy, and violent clashes with New World peoples as the unscrupulous, ambitious Francis pushes forward to achieve his goal of "girdling the globe." Lawlor's obviously exhaustive research comes through in the precise documentation of the stops along the way, in the colorful nautical slang, and in two comprehensive endnotes and an archival map of Drake's route."|`|VfFBv2tyaa	<a href="http://www.raincoast.com/libraries/pdfs/DeadReck.pdf.copy" rel="nofollow">http://www.raincoast.com/libraries/pdfs/...</a> and paste this link i hope it helps.

It replaced the quarrelsome, confused, and vengeful pantheon of pagan gods with a single, friendly, loving, and all-knowing, all-controlling god. "Everything is part of His plan" is a lot more comforting than "Sometimes They mess up". The concept of monotheism is very powerful, and Christianity made it more than just a Hebrew phenomenon; in addition, they added the concepts of forgiveness and divine love that, I believe, even modern people still can't fully grasp the significance of.
GldfYvhcaa	If you like rock songs and can't sing very high notes (I can't either ^^), try the band Weezer. Songs like Heartbeat and My Name is Jonas may be good for you; but just go on YouTube and find a song you like by them. ^^    Good luck with your show!! 
BCebZRu3aa	LIFE, also known as The Game of Life, is a board game originally created in 1860 by Milton Bradley, as The Checkered Game of Life. The modern version was originally published in 1960 by the Milton Bradley Company (now a subsidiary of Hasbro). Two to six players can participate in one game; however, variations of the game have been made to accommodate a maximum of eight or ten players.    The game consists of a track, on which players travel by spinning a small wheel with spaces numbered 1 through 10, located in the middle of the board. The board also contains small mountains, buildings, and other similar pieces, so the playing area does not appear flat. Playing pieces are small, colored plastic automobiles which come in six different colors (red, blue, white, yellow, orange, and green), and each pawn has six holes in the top in which the "people pegs" are placed throughout the game as the player "gets married" and has or adopts "children".    Each game also includes a setup for a bank, which includes imitation money (in denominations ranging from $5,000 to $100,000), insurance policies (automobile, life, fire, and/or homeowners' insurance depending on the version), $20,000 promissory notes, and stock certificates. Other tangibles vary with the game version.    Hope this helps.|`|v1xDXHG5aa	Hi,    God, the author of life, knows. He says:     "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (1)    Related to that, Jesus said, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent." (2)    He also said, "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."

A grand game.    As a game, it can be examined and better understood. Then, it  can be played better.    The purpose of the game is to grow through experience. The end  result of infinite growth is to realize our oneness with the  underlying source of all reality - that of Infinite Being.    Therefore, the meaning of life is growth in consciousness.    Your primary purpose in life is to experience life from one individual, unique point of view. You are an expression of Infinite Being as it experiences itself from all possible viewpoints. We are all - each and every one of us - aspects of the One as it views itself from an infinite number of viewpoints.       Love & Blessings   Milly|`|J8kMyPFuaa	Dog eat Dog

A1PLJKhUaa	I hated her because I'm H/HR, always have been, always will.|`|swigidUeaa	bonnie wright isn't pretty enough to play ginny in the movies.|`|wZFlfRahaa	I'm neutral about her, but I understand why some people would dislike her. She's really rude to Fleur, she's praised for hexing Zacharias for practically no reason, and Harry never notices any bad sides in her. Everybody thinks she's funny and she can be pretty mean sometimes. Plus, she liked Harry before she even met him, and them they end up getting married.    And yes, I don't really like the actress.|`|ItJhWTCBaa	Because she is Ron's little sister. I like Ron, but I don't think that Ginny and Harry should have ended up together. For some reason, I just find her irritating. And in the movies... I don't think they chose the right person.|`|FKwuuiwSaa	She's a Mary-Sue, plain and simple.|`|AA10711985	really you hated her? she is my favorite character!|`|iaBSTFwFaa	I LOVE Ginny!|`|ft8ehfiAaa	I liked her in the books|`|4F8b4D6Laa	I don't like Ginny because she started as a fangirl, which is ok, and in the end of book 2 she sounded like she had grown up and stopped her fangirl-ism. And then in book 5 she appears again and she says "she never gave him up", which means now her fangirl-ism was portrayed as love, which I particularly found to be the most ridiculous thing ever.    Also, suddenly she's not a normal HP character but a Mary Sue. In the most irritating way (very stupid but portrayed as really intelligent etc).

It's pop philosophy to think there is always an opportunity.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	He who step forward to solve the crisis is rewarded|`|9qiLZp50aa	A crisis gives you the chance to find out who is really going to step forward in your life and help you out. It lets you learn something. Without a problem, there is no solution, therefore you learn nothing new.|`|Iva8drdfaa	Well, when you look in history, you see that many of the worlds greatest leaders came into power during crisis.|`|cxVmq2kraa	It allows you to become what you want.  A crisis may destroy you mentally but it expands your understanding of yourself.  That alone is a gift.|`|AA10391664	Success comes from within. Crisis presents an opportunity to distinguish yourself from those who only appear successful, those who only appear to know whats going on, those who were in the right place at the right time, and through no effort of their own are (or were) "successful".      Success in every case comes to those who are contriarians, those who see through the doom and gloom and visualize the future.    Fortunes are only made by taking a chance.    The chineese character symbol for 'crisis' and 'opportunity' are exactly the same. There are 3000 years of history to back that up.|`|OtycNjSqaa	She is an opportunity for some, an exit for others  But, don't cry over spilled milk! Just clean it up. How?  With a vowel:  i.

yOhUkaSOaa	The soul is a metaphysical entity and therefore does not have mass, so when the soul leaves the body, the total mass of the body will remain the same|`|	Yes.|`|	Reductio ad absurdium ftw|`|	Theoretically, no. Weight is measure of gravity acting on a mass. One's soul hasn't been proven to contain a mass and therefore one's body is not losing any mass by losing its soul,  therefore the amount of gravity acting upon one's body after death is the same - you weigh the same.|`|	don't be daft. what on earth do you need a soul for? (apart from conveniently allowing you to escape death, of course) the entire concept of the soul is a ridiculous, obviously made-up get out clause and if something doesn't exist it is rather unlikely to weigh very much!    obviously people are scared of death. after all, if life is good who would want it to end? but end it must.    if you want to know what death is like; it is very similar to being unconscious - except you don't wake up.
XIkL2GmXaa	1. McCandless thinks his Datsun is a "piece of junk" when he abandons it. In reality, it was fine. What was wrong with it and how did it get that way?    The flood that passed through partially buried it in sand and the battery died    2. In Mexico, McCandless runs into trouble as he is canoeing. Explain his troubles in Mexico.    The river peters out into a system of irregation canals    3. Many people were immediately drawn to Chris and became good friends with him. One such person was Franz, who helped Chris on a number of occasions, including taking him to Grand Junction, Colorado, so that Chris could get to South Dakota. What did Franz do when he got the news that Chris had died in Alaska?    Wrote to Outside Magazine to tell Krakauer he had known Mccandless for one, also bought and RV and began to travel the country.    4. Often times we can have strong similarities and strong differences with the same person. This is the case with Chris and his dad. Give two ways they were similar and two ways they were different.    Both were extremely intelligent and business savy but walt is very matieralistic and does not have chris's defined moral compass  5. Chris was a naturally talented athlete but almost impossible to coach because he always wanted to do it "his way." Give one example of this when he competed in sports.    6. What terrible truth did Chris discover about his father?    That he was born as the result of an affair and his father had another family    7. No doubt there are many vocal critics of McCandless and the decisions he made and the life he lived, yet the author keeps coming to McCandless' defense. Explain one point of criticism and explain how Krakauer comes to McCandless' defense.    Kraukauer uses his own expierence on Denali to explain a youthful drive for danger and independence.    8. According to Krakauer, what were the two pivotal mistakes for Chandless that led to his death?    Lack of preparation (not bringing map) and bad information from others (smoking moose and plant book)

If you listen to a sad love song it could make you feel better about getting dumped or something.  But if you listen to a song about life after the death of a relative it will probably make you fell worse.

9CN0ZvAVaa	I say dark humour, that's how I interpreted it. Wonderful romances usually don't end in tragedy. Both Romeo and Juliet had a sudden infatuated love for each other, and when Romeo finds Juliet, assuming she is dead, he makes the same sudden, hasty decision to kill himself. Same with Juliet, when she finds him. That sounds like dark humour to me. Anyways, I didn't enjoy their love, I hated Romeo. But that may be because I live centuries apart from when he wrote it, we won't know for sure since Shakespeare is long dead and present time is much different.|`|9Duha1k4aa	I agree with the first answer. I don't think that Romeo is all too well. People just fail to see through the facade of perfection he supposedly carries.    1) Romeo is superficial. He loved Rosaline because of her looks, and quickly moved on to the next prey.   2) He killed Paris - wtf? Murder can't be justified in any way.   3) Who falls in love with their cousins murderer?     I guess that this is good, though, because it gives a realistic element to the play. As for Juliet, she's a pansy. I wish the bad guy didnt die.I love Tybalt!|`|CoNUK7sKaa	Romeo is a buttface. i really dont like the pansy! i mean REALLY!!!??? he falls in love with that roseline girl, or whatever her name is, and then like five seconds later hes all about juliet. i mean yeah, they could have fallen in love but they would need more time to do that. hes all about the beauty, hes just lucky he was hot himself|`|n7Aq5TvWaa	I personally think the whole story is ironic|`|J4BxsLSXaa	omg ofcourse its wonderful story! ofcourse it is! i love it, it makes me cry. and ohh how could u say its a DARK HUMOR nah no way, iam sure u didnt understand the story, and ur previous answerer is really retard she didnt understand it :| i'd advice u to read it again its so beautiful and sad and no thay werent young Romeo was 15 and Juliet was 13, in our time its young to get married like thay did but for that time it was normal. love is a beautiful but undiscovered feeling ur previous retard answerer said that Romeo was unserious about falling inlove with Juliet but that can heppen to EVERYBODY its called love from 1 sign and thay were made for eachother even dangerous and risky things couldnt make tham give up tell me if that was unserious would thay end thair lives and suicide for an "unserious" love? ofcourse no, its sad because thay at last got together and everything got ruined in minitues :( its also verry sad because it was about only earley/late minitues, if everything went ok they would be happy :(     no its not written to tell youth what NOT to do ofcourse, its written to show that people shall love eachother (i mean Romeo's and Juliet's familys were enimies of eachother) but later only, thay realised that thay were wrong but it was TOO late unfortunately. Well I cant tell u the emotions that are feeled in that story if u didnt understand it by yourself. read it again or watch the film :) hope u enjjoy it. :)

M2thieHqaa	Timothy Dexter, a mentally-disabled man who married into wealth and then made a fortune doing some of the dumbest things imaginable. Dexter was the Forrest Gump of the 1700's.     One of his friends told him that the people in the West Indies had no bed warming pans. True enough, of course, but in the sweltering West Indies (Bahamas, Jamaica, etc.) you don't need them. Timothy didn't know that, of course, but he quickly loaded one of his ships with bed warming pans and dispatched the ship to the islands. His neighbors and fellow businessmen laughed long and loud behind his back, certain that he would be ruined, or at least, embarassed.    However, sugar refiners in Jamaica quickly discovered that the bed warming pans were excellent for straining out the cooking sugar and were even better for refining molasses. Timothy Dexter's shipment quickly brought him a second fortune!    Determined now to ruin him, Dexter's enemies told him to sell coal in Newcastle, England. Dexter filled one of his ships with coal and sent the ship to the English town, which, of course, is (even today) one of the biggest coal-producing cities in the world. Under normal circumstances, this should have ruined him. But Dexter's luck held true, however, for not only did his coal shipment arrive right in the middle of a coalminer's strike, but also in a particularly frigid winter! The shipment of American coal was quickly sold at auction to the highest bidder!    Dexter's critics were aghast. How could this bumbling idiot continue to find success at every turn? Dexter was by now so wealthy that he had even hired a personal poet laureate to accompany him wherever he went. He also started referring himself as "Lord Timothy", or, "Lord Dexter". His enemies decided to ruin at him at all costs and started offering him the most inane suggestions for commercial ventures. Dexter acted on nearly all of them, with surprising results:    They told Dexter to round up all the stray cats he could find and send them to the Caribbean islands. His ships made landfall on islands that were overrun by rats, and the cats fetched premium prices!    Another person told him to send wool mittens to Barbados. In Barbados, the mittens were quickly bought up by Asian traders who then exported them to Siberia. Dexter made money again!    By the end of his life, Dexter owned a huge estate in Chester, New Hampshire. He had an army of servants, and wrote a book about himself. Even though the book was extremely difficult to read (almost no punctuation), it quickly sold out and ran to eight editions.|`|fQmJSlEyaa	Aleister crowley the occultist|`|hJmVcWekaa	Ok Michael Jackson by far!!!|`|WrmeB8zEaa	Pee Wee Herman...?|`|HRUZ8HhFaa	Jim Carey!!!! he is crazy.|`|MFF61HvDaa	Liberace    Tiny Tim, did you ever hear him sing " tiptoe thru the tulips ?

Tx8JHmDvaa	no one knows. there hasn't been a lot information on it on any of the sites. my theory is that the book will be called Empire because Eragon and Saphira are finally going to go head on with the king. I believe there will be a green dragon on the cover but nothing is confirmed. as for when its coming out, i read somewhere that Paolini has started writing it and it should be coming out around 2010 but don't hold him to it. remember how long it took him to write brisingr? like 3 years. i guess we'll just have to wait and see. i really hope its soon though. i'm dying to read it!

fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing  at affordable costs.    The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.    Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.    Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose books are of the highest quality, bar none.    Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their books top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.    Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your books production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.    Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.    You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.    I hope I helped.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You try to find an agent who is prepared to spend time trying to sell it. That agent will then try to find a publisher who wants to print it.    You have it pretty much backwards, I'm afraid. It's not a question of you taking your pick of publishers. It's a question of the publishers taking their pick of the available manuscripts they are offered.|`|gAWWyDLhaa	Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit http://www.writersdigest.com to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.    There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.    At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit http://www.agentquery.com). Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.    If you decide to self-publish, then you will pay (potentially up to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on which publisher you choose).     Good luck!
R02aazVdaa	It was initially titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it to reflect a story that went beyond a character portrait.    After giving Jem and Scout air-rifles as Christmas presents, Atticus warns the children that, although they can "shoot all the bluejays [they] want," they must remember that "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird". Maudie later explains that it is a sin because mockingbirds do no harm. They only provide pleasure with their songs. It's a symbol of innocence and beauty against racism and hatred.|`|DvToP5h7aa	To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee      The title of To Kill a Mockingbird comes from something both Atticus and Miss Maudie tell Jem and Scout: its a sin to kill a mockingbird (10.7, 10.9). Theres more on mockingbirds as a symbol in Symbols, Imagery, Allegory, but why make this phrase the title?    And why isnt the book called Its a Sin To Kill a Mockingbird? That would make the meaning clearer, right? Or perhaps the meaning is supposed to be vague, to make the reader picking up the novel in a bookstore or library wonder what it means. Why would anyone want to kill a mockingbird?  which is, of course, a useful question to keep in mind while reading the book. So before the novel even begins, the title starts raising questions about the uses, or perhaps uselessness, of violence.     http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/li...|`|R5UIMBvcaa	In it, someone (Atticus, I think) says that it's a sin to kill a mockingbird, because mockingbirds don't harm anyone but contribute beauty to the world.  Two of the characters, Tom and Boo, are "mockingbirds" for that reason.  Both are rather innocent, vulnerable people who do little kindnesses for certain others.  Atticus is unable to save Tom, but at the end he makes sure that Boo will be left alone.|`|swigidUeaa	It's symbolic. Killing a mocking bird is like putting mr. Robinson [I think that's his name] on death row or like something else.|`|xv0ovZ63aa	First of all, a mockingbird is a bird who sings sweet songs. If you mark at a particular point of the book, Atticus tells Jem to not shoot at the mockingbirds because they do not harm anyone. The title "To Kill a Mockingbird" directly means "the death of innocence." Innocence meaning those who haven't done anything wrong. Tom Robinson was persecuted for being black. Atticus's values that he taught the kids are in the title, basically. =)|`|z36M42Zfaa	When Scout and Jem get guns for Christmas, Atticus tells them that he'd like it if they shot only at can piles, but that if they had to shoot birds, to just not shoot the mockingbird. The Aunt lady (I forget her name) and Atticus later explain that the mockingbird is innocent, never doing anything but singing for their enjoyment. So, in the story I suppose Tom Robinson could be the mockingbird of the story, along with perhaps the children in more subtle ways. Tom Robinson is innocent, and the the whole trial is about whether or not to hang him for a crime he didn't commit.|`|4d7e0a27ba5e4ba87a6136514bacd306aa	The 'mockingbird' motif occurs recurrently in the book. The 'mockingbird', songbirds, Atticus 'finch' are all references to small harmless birds that, at the most, sing and perhaps 'mock' harmlessly. As Miss Maudie says at one point, mockingbirds do nothing to anyone except sing, and therefore it is a sin to kill them. The mockingbird is then the symbol of the meek, the vulnerable, the innocent. The killing of one is consequently the killing of innocence, hence the title.|`|jRmIoOTcaa	It's called that because to kill a mockingbird means to destroy innocence because all mockingbirds bring is beauty. Harper lee named it to kill a mockingbird because it reflects the destruction of innocence destroyed by evil for example tom Robinson, Jem, boo radley, scout, and mayella all represent mockingbirds because their innocence was destroyed|`|zU6RUiUUaa	its called to kill a mockingbird because of the of what Jem and Scout are told when they get their air rifles.   it is also symbolic to the trial that Atticus is apart of.   it is the symbol of innocence.  and that's what all the characters are.

JIFi4Cvmaa	The artistic breakthrough that resulted in the earlier Excusado was brought to a new level as Weston produced works such as Chambered Nautilus (1927) and Pepper (1930). The first captures the symmetrical, luminous curved form of the shell against a dark background. In Pepper, one of the photographer's best-known works, a simple vegetable is transformed into a massive form, one with the muscularity of a human torso and the modeling of a great work of sculpture. Much of Weston's work in this period is sculptural in effect, influenced by Constantin Brancusi's way of transforming organic shapes into simplified, iconic imagery. So his pepper was a pepper, but was transformed into human torso.

Scribd and 4shared are sites that pirates use to park their stolen books.

The door became Mount Togakushi, and Kuzury became a nearby mountain of the same name. (wiki)    Love your song and dance Maddam. I'd join if I had the time.

BCebZRu3aa	LIFE, also known as The Game of Life, is a board game originally created in 1860 by Milton Bradley, as The Checkered Game of Life. The modern version was originally published in 1960 by the Milton Bradley Company (now a subsidiary of Hasbro). Two to six players can participate in one game; however, variations of the game have been made to accommodate a maximum of eight or ten players.    The game consists of a track, on which players travel by spinning a small wheel with spaces numbered 1 through 10, located in the middle of the board. The board also contains small mountains, buildings, and other similar pieces, so the playing area does not appear flat. Playing pieces are small, colored plastic automobiles which come in six different colors (red, blue, white, yellow, orange, and green), and each pawn has six holes in the top in which the "people pegs" are placed throughout the game as the player "gets married" and has or adopts "children".    Each game also includes a setup for a bank, which includes imitation money (in denominations ranging from $5,000 to $100,000), insurance policies (automobile, life, fire, and/or homeowners' insurance depending on the version), $20,000 promissory notes, and stock certificates. Other tangibles vary with the game version.    Hope this helps.|`|T8P2sXMGaa	to conquer your fears, and find balance. to grow  to carry out the human processes in the life cycle.    aka: no real meaning. its what u make of it.  but every time u ask.. u can give yourself a new meaning right?  a new answer.. therefore it is what u believe it to be.  the trick is to make it something that works for u.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Can't think of one. As you may already know, the works of Nietzsche were rewritten by his sister and brother-in-law and used to promote instead of question nihilism. This philosophy was taken up whole cloth by the Nazis during WWII. But Nietzsche himself did not mean to espouse those ideas, and for most people, nihilism is an adolescent fad.    I think there are some ideas that are fundamentally problematic, like solipsism, science worship, religious fundamentalism, nihilism and sophistry (this last one in which I excel!) None of these are "beyond the pale" so to speak, and I would die to defend people's right to believe them. So no I don't wish nihilism didn't exist. Then Dostoevsky wouldn't have written Crime and Punishment!|`|LJzHR4zhaa	Well, I don't know many philosophers, so...No.    But, I'll answer your first (fake) question.  Purpose of living is chosen by you. You are the one who decides your purpose. We all have different ones because we decide them. It's your life and you should live it your way, not asking somebody else what's the meaning of life. It is what you decide it to be! :)|`|rLtXrUA2aa	The true meaning of life is eat a lot of candy!  Plato, Pliny, Nietze, and Old man Poot have all written a lot about this.
a1Ngi39Xaa	I like to think so.  Things in my life seem to go much better with forgiveness.  Sometimes it takes me awhile to get there but I do seem to find it is helpful.  It makes it easier to move forward.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	I think that our dance becomes more graceful when we are guided by love, and some of the things that can come with love include grace, compassion, kindness, humility, joy, forgiveness and other qualities that enhance our lives and uplift our spirits.  Best wishes!
sdSpplGwaa	1. The writing is good  2. I love the characters  3. the covers  4. the romance and drama  5. I like how the vampires aren't like the traditional vampires  6. I like Stephenie Meyers author style  7. I like the location in the books  8. I like the names of the characters  9. I like the length of the books  10. I like how it is a simple read yet it still can have that feel like your not reading a book for 2 year olds  11. It is my favorite kind of genre  12. I like hw the idea of the book came from a dream  13. I like how there is always something going on in the book that makes you never want to put it down  14. if you want to re-read the series it wouldn't be boring because you would be so caught up in the last book you would forget what happened in the first  15. It is the kind of book i would read but there is a twist put in it|`|4rn3cGy0aa	See, here's the thing, I'm a Twilighter and I can admit that you are completely right, 100% about all 26 reasons, and I could probably think of 100 more reasons why all four of the Twilight books send terrible messages [I won't even GO THERE with Breaking Dawn >.>] but I can't give you reasons why I love it so much. Its a drug. Its bad but you need it.   But I think one reason might be Jacob, before Stephenie Meyer f**cked him over so badly she may as well have killed him off and made him imprint on that stupid f_cking demon spawn baby that shouldn't exist.   Seriously. Why couldn't he just imprint on that girl Lizzy he met, or Leah?  Anyway,  I love Jacob. Jacob should have hooked up with Leah and killed Bella and Edward and her demon spawn. Then Jacob, Leah, Seth, Rosalie, Emmett and the Volturi can all have a tea party together and -  OH YEAH.  The Volturi.  I love them. The whole concept of the Volturi is amazing, but they're all wasted. She could have did so many amazing things with them, but she didn't.  Thats why fanfiction-authors usually have more exciting plots than Stephenie does.|`|fTHE2OoQaa	its romantic  its dark  its buetiful  it has good charecters  the plot of the story is awsome  its a really good book for gothics like me  its enjoyable  it makes you want to read more  its like when you read it you can picture whats happining  it just plain rocks  the description is good  the way its all put together makes sence  it is the best book in the world  and it makes you want to read the whole series|`|TlqSAM0naa	1) It's a love story.  2) The story has a concept and all of them flow.  3) I am a lot like the character Bella.  4) I have reasons to connect with characters and I do not like Jacob.  5) Vampires are not always bad.  6) It is like Tuck Everlasting mixed with vampire books and it is a good mix.  7) Edward Cullen sounds hot in the books.  8) The way Edward looks at Bella.  9) The powers they have, and how the powers help the characters.  10) It has real-life concepts.  11) Carlisle is awesome and he makes me hate other doctors.  12) The Cullens are veg.  13) I enjoyed reading it so much that I read it twice [the first book].  14) I like how the names fit with what times the characters were born.  15) Every story needs good guys and bad guys and I like how the bad ones died.    &more      Now, how bout you post all the real reasons why you hate the books.    EDITED [response]  1)Bella is in love with him, && a lot of people get selfish when they love someone...  2)  I thought there was a plot about how she had to survive without him and how her life was still hard as a vampire.  3) personality? emmett is the lovable grizzly bear, alice is overreacting sister, rosalie is the ****** that wants her way....  4) i didn't notice bad writing.. i actually felt what the characters were feeling  6) opinion..we all have them =]  7)? i understand that the end was weak, but i the pregnancy was gross&different  8) i didn't like it  9) not really..she had to fight herself [internal] to be able to have that sheild extend..&& edward still can't hear her  10)jacob learns that he really loves renesmee, not bella [like that ], edward learns to resist bella more when she is mortal  11) doesn't 99% of the popular want a guy that loves them for them, even in sweats&in worst moments?  14) dunno how  17) a vampire love story? i don't think so..the cullens are vampires && they go against other vampires by choosing not to drink people blood..i think that is a good piece of literature  18) edward doesn't act like he's hott though..he doesn't relize his affect until she tells him..&& there are tons of clumsy girls but it's WHICH one that he falls in love with  19) she made it different [& they aren't vegetarians, they just relate to how vegetarians are]  21) but Bella doesn't mind =]  23) Bella is married to him though|`|LVZdzPmpaa	1. It's really good.    2. It's the best book ever!    3. OMG I want to marry Edward!    4. OMG I just love Bella.    5. It's awesome!    6. I couldn't put it down.    7. I can't wait for the next one!    8. It's genius.    9. It's amazing.    10. I read all of the books in less than one hour!    EDIT: Smiley, of course it's not legitimate! It is intended to be a joke in the spirit of "Twilight." "Twilight" is not legitimate and trying to come up with even two reasons to support the claim "Twilight is good." Anyone who proclaims a book "good" and supports that claim with "cuz I liked it idk" has no clue about what has literary value and what is rubbish.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	well to me i like it and i don't have 15 reasons. everyone has different opinions and i respect that|`|DjCLWseZaa	I wonder if anyone can do this? I don't like the books, but I'll try to think of fifteen reasons why people might:  1) they identify with Bella and share her feelings  2) They wish their boyfriends were like Edward  3) they enjoy reading the many many ways that Meyer describes Edward's hottness  4) they are clumsy and find the book hopeful- some centarian vampire might obsess over THEM!  5) they enjoy learning all the new ways to say, "I love you, I'm obsessed"  6) they enjoy the writing style (to each his own)  7) the plot matches that daydream they had during math class to the letter  8) They enjoy reading about one dimensional characters, they are easy to understand.  9) They enjoy anything mushy (perhaps they watch hallmark commercials for fun?)  10) they like the fact that the action is watered down by so much repetitive romance, so it is easier for action-haters to swallow.  11) the formulaic writing style (action at the end, ed/bella comes to the rescue, battles shortened/avoided) lends to ease in prediction. (some people get a kick out of being right, others find it helpful to aid their understanding)  12) It's over-descriptiveness is quite interesting to some people (yawn)  13) Many people find Bella's dependency on men comforting, it makes them feel more confident in their own dependency (so sad)  14) some people actually find the shallow plot quite gripping  15) with a plot that is shallow and resembles a daytime TV show, it is easy for non-readers to digest.  * some people just like it for no reason.    Again, I personally did not like Twilight (yes I read them all twice, including MS). However, I can see where some people are coming from. I agree with all your reasons, BTW.|`|6HOcthxaaa	i have a question for you....if you hate the books so much..why did you go and read all four of them?!|`|ItJhWTCBaa	Edit|`|EeqmMNZWaa	If you don't like Twilight, that's cool.

The content is secondary to the wonderful writing!|`|ITKrTWVqaa	It is about vampires  It is about romance  Edward Cullen is hot  The diversity between edward in jacob is intense  also so is the action....which usually comes towards the end of the books.

I feel like a whole different world     The story is visulable     The movie was great    The actors were great in the movie     The book makes a lot of sense    It keeps me on the edge of my seat     Its funny      It made me love reading lol     Its not all about Vampires, its also about love and friendship|`|vCmriEdLaa	Star shine: Smiley asked for REASONS why you liked the book. Not that Stephanie Meyer is a good author.    Does anyone not know the difference between fact and opinion, anymore?      To Kristen T, I have a question for you: If Twilighters Haters never read the books, then why would they hate them?

xZ37ojk5aa	Awesome question    (I know that's not how the ceremony goes but I don't have it memorized)    Quailstar-a white and brown tom with green eyes(Leafclan leader)  Herontail-a light brown tabby she-cat(my daughters mentor)  Wingfur-an odd white tom with grey eyes(my son's mentor)  Petalfrost-a goldy cream she-cat with blue eyes(me)  Mousekit-a brown tabby she-cat with blue eyes(my daughter)  Stormkit-a dark grey tom with amber eyes(my son)  Flowerpelt-a pretty calico with black around the left eye and a half ginger half black nose and yellow-green eyes(my sister)  Gingerkit-a ginger she-cat with blue eyes(my sister's daughter)  Hollowkit-a black tom with amber eyes(my sister's son)  Snowkit-a white she-cat with green eyes(my sister's daughter)    I gazed down Mousekit, dozing close to my belly fur, Stormkit slept next to her. Carefully I bent my head to rasp my tongue over her brown tabby fur and then over his dark grey fur. I glanced over to my sister, Flowerpelt slept on her side her swollen belly evidence of her unborn kits. I parted my jaws to draw in the warm, milk-smelling air of the nursery and the calming scent of Leafclan, my clan, the clan that I had lived in all my life.    "Hush, Stormkit," I purred, and stay still do you want to look good for your apprentice ceremony or what?" He glared at me with mock anger in his amber eyes but, he stood still as I finished grooming his ruffled fur.     Stormkit stood by his sister, and gazed up at Quailstar on top of the Tall tree, where he addressed the clan for meetings and naming ceremonies.   "Mousekit, are you ready to become a warrior apprentice?" Quailstar asked calmly.  "Yes," Mousekit mewed excitedly.  "then from now on you will be known as Mousepaw and your mentor will be Herontail. Herontail will you teach her to be swift and cunning?"  "I will" the tabby she-cat responded with a quick nod and went to stand by her apprentice.  "Stormkit..."    "Gingerkit," Hollowkit barreled in to his sister, "got'cha!"  "Snowkit, get him off of me!" the little white kit butted her larger brother and the two she-cats leapt onto their brother. He squeaked and shoved them off then dashed away, I couldn't stop from purring in amusement. I turned to my sister, Flowerpelt was watching her kits play, too. The sudden pounding of paws and strong fear scent jerked my head to the entrance of camp and Mousepaw crashed through the thorn wall. I was on my feet and to her side instantly, she was trembling and panting.  "What happened? Where's the rest of the hunting patrol?" Quailstar asked worriedly.  "Rogues...lots of them...attacked us...by the...Great oak...hurry" she forced out breathlessly. Quailstar called together warriors and we raced to the Great oak. Cries of battle and pain soon came to our ears. When we reached the crest of a hill, my heart lurched sickeningly, I saw a small limp dark grey body. Stormpaw.    Go to my Questions and see my other story I like that one better.|`|e61b6f14e6d908535f36e113ec589f3caa	huh? I don't understand about the 3 cat thing at the end
bq98xZjcaa	the lesson is:   In order to feel love, have friendships it is required to open yourself a bit and take a risk.  Dont you agree?   they stated it on Page 289  "You don't believe in love, so it just follows logic you wouldnt believe in like, either. Or Friendship. Or anything that might involve even the smallest personal risk"

If it's your first draft, then you're good to go- it really pulled me in!  The one thing I noticed that kinda bugged me was in the second paragraph- "Nobody ever thought of me as attractive. My best feature was my eyes. They were a stunning light blue that took people's breath away." It's almost an oxymoron. She's not attractive, yet her eyes take your breath away. Perhaps you could say that her features are unremarkable, but she has piercing blue eyes or something like that.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	Very good.

But I might raise Grayson's age. You seem like you have a talent for this. But don't give away all your information at the begining other wise the reader will get confused and you'll have nothing to write about later. But def. keep trying, you can always go back and edit.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	You need to work on your basic skills.  Even something like, a 16-year-old boy that..."  A boy is a person; he's "who," not "that."  And "costed?"  The word is "cost."  Also, it's kind of awkward to write "my mother, Karen."  And "she had a husband, my dad, named Tim Harrison"  Unless the parents are divorced, this is an odd way to write it.  Why not just say, "My parents are Karen and Tim Harrison.  My dad's a famous screen actor."    Yes, this sounds picky, but it's like expecting to play major league baseball and you don't know how to hold the bat or which base to run to if you hit the ball.  You need to get the basic rules down in order to succeed.|`|UIILEn0Uaa	I liked it.  There were some spelling errors, but doesn't everyone?  I like the name Grayson, it's cute - and not too common(for girls)    I would work on a couple of the words,  and maybe not skipping so much in the beginning.  it goes from dance  to plane  to mexico  to house  all very quickly.  I might stop and add some more conversations, or like, when she fell asleep on the plane, have her dream of what her cousin might look like now, or Mexico.. something to take up more time.    Other than that, I think your a nice writer.  and good luck with finishing your story.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	There were VERY briefly 49-star flags.  Alaska became the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959, and Hawaii entered the Union on August 21, 1959... a period of just over 6 months.    The Flag Act of 1818 specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.    I'm GUESSING that because the flag manufacturers KNEW that there would only be a 1 year span for a 49 star-flag that VERY few were made (outside of official US Government usage), and that the PUBLIC also figured... why buy a 49 star and have to buy another a year later !!|`|GClXFKp1aa	When my son had to learn California Flag.

Firstly the male vampires should not physically be able to...fit they're side of the deal, as their organs don't work, therefore they're reproductive organs should not work.    However, if this did happen, I think the point with the Twilight vampires is that they're not really dead, just.... have a lack of bodily functions. This means that the whole 'half human - half dead' thing doesn't really apply.     But then again, his genes should still be as they were, unless the venom changed that, which i guess it could have.     So, Yes, I guess it is possible in some respects. The child could have picked up some of his super strong and hard skin genes, and made sure to take just Bella's human 'working  organs' genes.|`|UCbBBAZPaa	goodness you have a little temper there dont you?

qn9NilP3aa	Classic literature has to be original or take a very unique stance on something that has already been done and almost perfectly articulate whatever it is that the book is about. Classics have powerful language, themes, and has to be both with the times when it was written and be open to modern and future interpretation. Also, most books considered classics are at least 20 years old, though there are plenty of books written recently that will likely be considered classics in a few decades.

imgKqm9Laa	"If it weren't the way it is, then you wouldn't be here to ask that question"...     But more importantly, our universe's state it determined by other states in time. I don't want to say there is a direct causal relationship since there is evidence of non causal relationships, so in other words, effect can precede cause.     Often with complex systems, such as the universe, it seems intuitive to believe there must be a complicated set of laws or reasons that explain the behavior, however, there are plenty of complex mathematical systems, some of which exhibit total randomness and complexity, but are actually governed by very simple laws. Look up rule 30 cellular automaton on google.     Computationally irreducible is a term used to describe systems which cannot be predicted by an equation. For example, simple events, such as the position of a swinging pendulum can be predicted by a single equation. Some systems, such as the universe, and certain cellular automata, and algorithms, cannot be predicted. They must be processed (frame by frame) or moment by moment to figure out what will happen.     In the case of Rule 30, it was proven that this is the case. For example (and this will make more since once you read about it) if you wanted to know the value of the cell on the middle column on row 10^10000, the only way to determine this would be to "compute" every single preceding row, there are no shortcuts.

LPO8RlVdaa	The ancient wonders of the world became so because a) they were feats of extraordinary engineering or aesthetic skill at the time, and b) were quite literally wonders to behold, with everyone from around the known world coming to visit them, and c) were unique.    The new, modern wonders pretty much held the same criteria. Although in my opinion the voting system was flawed as some of the choices were political or cultural based rather than on the above criteria. Some of the choices shouldn't be there.     The natural wonders on the other hand are different only in that they are areas of outstanding NATURAL rather than man made beauty and uniqueness.|`|wenRfE3Saa	i guess it has to be amazing and wonderful and awe inspiring,it would have to be of great importance and have a certain appeal, beautiful to look at or be something which can do something remarkable in its environment.  not to sure really|`|OFA2LAM5aa	The Seven Wonders of the world are used to describe the most spectacular man-made structures in the world.  In the ancient world the Great Pyramid at  Giza is probably the best known and it still exists. The other wonders have all disappeared.      To become a great wonder it has to be huge and an engineering feat.  There are many theories as to how the Great Pyramid was built, but we still really don't know. Modern cranes would bend and break trying to lift those stones.   Also the mathematics used to design the structure was far advanced, and done without computers or calculators. It was the tallest man-made structure for 3800 years.  It was built nearly 4000 years ago.  That's what makes it such a wonder.  The majority of the world was emerging from the Stone Age when the Egyptians built the pyramids.  How could such an advanced civilization rise up out of the Nile river delta while the rest of the world was still hunting and gathering food.  It begs the question, is the pyramid the wonder or the people who built it?|`|kacLYFrHaa	It depends on which type you're talking about. There are the ancient wonders, the modern wonders, and the natural wonders. The ancient and modern wonders are man made wonders while the natural wonders are wonders of nature. In both cases they are deemed quite impressive and awe inspiring.
TZ4MQHDcaa	As chronicles go, yes it may be cited as a reliable primary source. The problem with contemporary chronicles is that they may be riddled with bias. Here we have a Norman chronicler recording the events of a Norman victory and supporting the Norman view that William of Normandy had a right to the English throne. However, William of Poitier's account is arguably the most important of our sources relating to the Norman Conquest, and certainly the most important for the invasion and campaign of 1066, so go for it.  The piece in question refers to an occasion during the battle when it was believed that William had been killed, and the morale of his army dropped. As is stated in the chronicle, he raised his helmet in order that his troops could see that he was still alive.  The so-called retreat referred to here is argued among historians. Some say that the Bretons on William's left flank ran away, so drawing some hundred or so English militia off the defended hill. Others (myself included) believe the Breton action to be a feigned retreat, a deliberate action to bring about exactly what happened. Such a strategy had been practised by the Normans and Bretons many times over the previous century.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	Let's look at it another way - can you actually visualise this in the chaos of a medieval battle?    One man and his spear couldn't stop a panic-stricken flight.  How many people could he address - no microphones then remember?    William had his marshals whose job it was to stop the flight - maybe he put them in motion, maybe not.  If he made his speech, it couldn't have been heard by more than a handful.    There are episodes like this in Julius Caesar's War Commentaries.  As a cleric, William of Poitiers could well have been familiar with Caesar' works.|`|d36da7bbff05d23acceb010110cea63eaa	William of Poitier was the author of "The Deeds of Duke William" written in 1070 AD, a mere 4 years after the Battle of Hastings. He was, at least in the eyes of present day historians, a propagandist rather than a reporter. What that means is that Wm. of Poitier wrote the official story of the winning party, rather than being right at the scene and recording everything fairly. That's a good reason to take most of the special accounting of Duke William's heroism with a grain of salt. Duke William became the first Norman king of England and he had absolute power so anyone who wrote about him during his lifetime had to be very careful about what they said.|`|0JtPptKWaa	umm... it's okay.... doesn't really give too much info about the battle itself..... sounds mostly like some epic novel....|`|38619f0f81204837c01cf800f96fba31aa	what do you think?  do you think its reliable?    after all its YOUR homework, not mine or others.    do you think that any account is free from bias or prejudice  bear in mind the victor nearly always writes the history, the victors perspective then is given more credit    even the most objective observer can only report what they see, and anything they see is interpretated by their minds.    bear in mind that one persons prejudice someone elses slef evident truth.|`|uqb7dkBbaa	William of Poitiers (c. 1020-1090), Norman chronicler, was born at Les Praux, near Pont-Audemer, and belonged to an influential Norman family. After serving as a soldier he studied at Poitiers, and then returning to Normandy became chaplain to Duke William (William the Conqueror) and archdeacon of Lisieux.    Orderic Vitalis gives a short biography of him in his Historia ecclesiastica and says that he also wrote verses.    He wrote a eulogistic life of the duke, Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum, the earlier and concluding parts of which are lost; the extant part covers the period between 1047 and 1068 and is valuable for details of the Conqueror's life, although untrustworthy with regard to affairs in England. It gives a detailed description of the preparations for the Norman Conquest of England, the Battle of Hastings and its aftermath. According to E. A. Freeman, "the work is disfigured by his constant spirit of violent partisanship."

He would have been in a good position to record the facts (dates, places, etc.), but consider his relationship to William: any account is going to be very sympathetic to William, and there's a good chance that his retelling has been 'jazzed up' a bit.    The bit about surrounding "several thousand of their pursuers" is decidedly dodgy. For one, the pursuers numbered several hundred, not thousand (the entire Saxon army is estimated at around 7,500 men), and some did manage to get back up the hill to the Saxon lines.    Personally, I'm very doubtful that William would have managed to hold onto his spear when he'd just had his horse killed beneath him. Speaking from experience, it's hard enough keeping a two-handed grip on a spear when charged into by a big bloke in a mailshirt - keeping a one-handed grip on a spear while being thrown from a falling horse sounds very unlikely to say the least.
FNwYzjogaa	By shape shifters do you mean lycanthropes or just general shapeshifters like a one form into a complete other.    If it's done well it could be interesting.

It's a Russian trilogy (I believe they were books first and then movies). The concept with them is a war between vampires, shapeshifters and "others." Others are people with odd abilities that I never quite understood. Vampires and Shapeshifters hate each other and the others could choose to be on either side. It was an odd story that got more confusing as you go along. I watched the first two movies. The third is coming out soon and will be done in English in America.    Anyway, all that to say. Vampires and shapeshifters have definitely shared stories before. fairies, not so much. When I think of fairies, I think of tiny little pixies like Tinkerbell. I can't picture them marrying vampires.|`|d89ugMAcaa	Enough with the vampire stories|`|DjCLWseZaa	Finally, a fresh sounding idea that involves vampires! I like it.|`|U2wkJRrMaa	I probably wouldn't. I would try to stray away from anything about vampires, as you said they're generic. You don't want to be olne in a million other stories. If you do want to write about vampires then you should, but just try to make it different, I don't really like the whole idea of faeries and shape-shifters though. I don't know. Something about this irks me.
yj3GT7jOaa	Most songs have a catch phrase or what is sometimes referred to as a hook.  I would think here the line may be 'Can't you see  it's killing me?'  The catch line helps both the singer and the audience to remember the song later.   The rhythm is good but I had a few problems with the patterns.  That is not uncommon with a new song.  Good Luck|`|0BioKSmaaa	i think this song is beautiful   it makes me think of my relationship with my father   absolutely heart-warming   and moving   (i knw u obviously meant this for a relationship between a guy & girl)   the only thing i can say is that you have a typo "loosing" is "losing" - but that's a common mistake  other than that, i think this is beyond great   excellent work :D

	New France was occupied by the French, the English colonies by the English. The English were very strict about social distinctions between the Native Americans and themselves. The English often tried to get land from the Natives by drawing up contracts that were poorly understood by the natives. When the English took the land, the natives got mad at the English and attacked the English, so the English then attacked the natives. This didn't happen to the same extend in New France because the French were not so keen about maintaining the status quo as the English were.

FKwuuiwSaa	Not even close.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I never thought of it as one. Frodo is a mature "man" when he is called to go on his quest.  The only character who really makes the transition from boy to man in the novel, in my opinion, is Pippin.    I suppose everyone will think of Huckleberry Finn or The Catcher in the Rye, but why not go FAR back and consider the Odyssey from the perspective of Telemachus?  At the beginning he's still a boy (in outlook, anyway, although he's nineteen or twenty), and at the end he's definitely a man.  Or here are a couple of other possibilities:    To Kill a Mockingbird.  Although Scout is still a little girl at the end, probably only about eight years old, she is becoming a Southern woman.  Think of the incident in the kitchen when she and Aunt Alexandra and Miss Maudie learn of the death of Tom Robinson.  They commiserate with one another, and then they steel themselves and return to the living room to serve refreshments to the women's church group.  Then at the end, when it devolves on Scout to take Boo home, she refuses (in her own mind) to lead a grown man down the street by the hand, and she has him crook his arm appropriately so that she can take it and it will seem to onlookers that HE is escorting HER.     Gone With the Wind.  At the begining Scarlett is a teenage girl without a care in the world except the thought of losing her favorite beau, and at the end she is a strong woman who has survived the destruction of the world she knew and is already contemplating how to get her husband back.|`|R5nwTe2Iaa	In a way, yes.

In 2008 the Russians deployed the Topol M three-stage cold launched, solid fuel, multiple-warhead nuclear missile.  These new multiple warhead systems uses "decoy warheads" to defeat any anti-missile defense shield.    The US missile development budget has been cash-strapped from the Iraq and Afghan wars so no new systems are on the horizon.      The Russians have made it clear, they are willing to sign a "no first use treaty" with the US as well as a nuclear weapons reduction treaty.  Under the Bush administration, the Russian proposals were rejected.    Finally, China and India after decades of studying Russian rocket designs, have come up with their own indigenous systems that are quite advanced and soon may  rival US and Russian missiles.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Several countries have nuclear missiles at this point.

FaX8awk1aa	After 1816 the Federalists had no national influence apart from John Marshall's Supreme Court. They had some local support in New England, New York, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. After the collapse of the Democratic-Republican Party in the course of the 1824 presidential election, most surviving Federalists (including Daniel Webster) joined former Democratic-Republicans like Henry Clay to form the National Republican Party, which was soon combined with other anti-Jackson groups to form the Whig Party. Some former Federalists like James Buchanan and Roger B. Taney became Jacksonian Democrats. The name "Federalist" came increasingly to be used in political rhetoric as a term of abuse, and was denied by the Whigs, who pointed out that their leader Henry Clay was the Democratic-Republican party leader in Congress during the 1810s.
FaX8awk1aa	A commission had been sent to France in 1797 to discuss the disputes that had arisen out of the U.S.'s refusal to honor the Franco-American Treaty of 1778.President Adams had criticized the French Revolution, so France began to break off relations with the U.S. Adams sent delegates to meet with the French foreign minister Talleyrand in the hopes of working things out. Talleyrand's three agents told the American delegates that they could meet with Talleyrand only in exchange for a very large bribe. Tallyrand's agents told them that Tallyrand requested a $250,000 bribe and that France can get a loan of $12 million. The Americans did not pay the bribe.    In 1798 Adams made the incident public, substituting the letters "X, Y and Z" for the names of the three French agents in his report to Congress.      [edit] Summary  The French seized nearly three hundred American ships bound for British ports in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas. Federalist leaders such as Alexander Hamilton called for war, but President Adams sent a diplomatic delegation (Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Marshall, and Elbridge Gerry) to Paris in 1797 to negotiate peace. Three French agents, Jean Conrad Hottinguer, Pierre Bellamy, and Lucien Hauteval, demanded a large cash bribe for the delegation to speak to French foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Prigord, a huge loan to help fund the French wars as a condition for continuing negotiations, and a formal apology for comments made by Adams.[2] The Americans broke off negotiations and went home.    President Adams, still looking for diplomatic maneuverability, declined to make the documents related to the exchange public. However, Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party, sensing that the American delegates were to blame for the failure, and looking to weaken the Federalist party, demanded to see the key documents. Adams released the delegation's reportwith the names of the three French agents changed to X,Y, and Z. The documents, which clearly showed French fault in the failure of the negotiations, set off a firestorm of anti-French sentiment not previously found in the United States.    France's refusal to receive the accredited U.S. representatives, let alone negotiate with them, without bribes for its leading members and a loan for its military incursions in Europe seemed an extreme insult to Americans. The public learned that the American delegates had rejected the demands. "The answer is no! No, not a sixpence!" was their response (translated by newspaper editors as "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!") [3]. As a result, Jefferson's maneuvering to publicize the documents backfired against his own party, giving the Federalists leverage to continue a military build-up.    The U.S. had offered France many of the same provisions found in Jay's Treaty with Britain, but France reacted by sending Marshall and Pinckney home. Gerry remained in France, thinking he could prevent a declaration of war, but did not officially negotiate any further.    The conflict that erupted was dubbed Quasi-War as there was no formal declaration of war. Between 1798 and 1800, American and French warships and merchants ships fought in actual combat in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States. The Americans terminated the Franco-American Alliance. Adams began to build up the navy, and a new army was raised. Full-scale war seemed at hand, but Adams appointed new diplomats led by William Murray. They negotiated an end to hostilities through the 1800 Treaty of Mortefontaine. The XYZ Affair significantly weakened the affection Americans had for France

7kUyIGQhaa	Most Germans did not think of it as 'Hitler's army' any more than American soldiers think they're in 'Bush's army' or 'Obama's army'.    Early in the war Germans were highly motivated and, although conscripts, there were plenty of volunteers for elite units such as the air force, paratroopers, the Waffen SS, or the submarine arm.  Later in the war recruits were harder to find, and by the end anybody could be dragged into the army.  Even children and old men were conscripted into the 'Volkssturm', or home guard, and sent off the fight with minimal training or weapons.    Many foreigners joined the German armed forces, such as Latvians, Dutch, Spaniards and so on.  Some joined out of Nazi affiliation, many more to avoid being forced to work in German factories (often very dangerous).    The SS ran the camps, not the army.  The army had some role in helping round up Jews, and in killing Commissars (political leaders) in the Russian Army.  Troops who fought in the vicious and barbaric Russian Front could often be moved West to fight the British and Americans, and against this enemy show respect for all the rules of war.    All soldiers in all armies report moments when they see killing 'illegally' (such as shooting men trying to surrender), and alongside incidents of great humanity.  War is odd.|`|bdnMQnVHaa	Of course.  Not every soldiers always agrees with every decision made by their civilian superiors.|`|I08iONdaaa	That's a really unfair question to Germans. If you opened a history book you would know that not all German's were Nazi's that about 90% of the concentration camps were outside of Germany and that Germany also instituted a draft. The penalty for desertion was death, and Germans didn't have a whole lot of options but to go along with their country. Or you could surrender to the Russians who would probably kill you too.     Seriously, there were bad Germans, but there were good Germans jsut trying to survive the war too.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	The concentration camps were not run by the regular army (the Wermacht). They were run by the SS (Schutzstaffel). The SS were all volunteers, and knew what they were getting into.    The Wermacht were just normal soldiers - pretty much the same as American of British troops. They were conscripted, and plenty didn't want to be there.|`|hzGpR1Rtaa	Almost all of the people in Hitlers military were people just like you and me. You have to understand that we aren't as individual as we think we are and most of our decisions in life are based on group psychology. Being in Germany at that time was also more stressful than most people can handle and also think rationally. Think of those cults that were all over the news a few months ago.

First of all, there are always those who don't want to be in uniform, and World War II was no exception. I seem to recall a book called The Black March, which was the personal story of a German soldier who fought in World War II. His story is particularly haunting, and is not for the faint-hearted.     The concentration camps were under the direct control of the Allgemeine SS, who were hard-core fanatics. There are many books about , but I can't think of anyone who reported a sympathetic Nazi. I'd recommend the book, "Night", by Elie Wiesel, for a proper understanding of how terrible that was.     One sympathetic German soldier, however, did make the decision to give up the war. He simply wanted to go home. That story can be read in the book, "As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me", by J.M. Bauer.|`|vwqjG9vfaa	they still think the only thing Hitler did wrong was get caught.

And **** the kruats.|`|AA12243350	Just as with any "army" there were those who did not want to be there. Many of the  troops, fought because they were forced into the military. For many, it was join, or die. I don't mean to lessen the horrible things that happened, or to try to sound like I'm excusing the atrocities commited by that mad man and his insane henchmen, just that yes, there were soldiers in the german army who were there against their will.|`|k29t963Aaa	I'm not an expert on conscription in the Wehrmacht, but if you're talking about 'solders in Adolf Hitler's army that really did not want to be in it but were force to be in it', then you should really try researching the Ost battalions. They were mainly Eastern European prisoners of war that were conscripted into the Army.     Also, in the later years of war, running low on men, many Russians served as 'volunteers' in Hitler's army. "By the beginning of 1944, the Wehrmacht had "volunteers" from France, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Asian Russia, North Africa, Russia, Ukraine, Ruthenia, and even some Muslims and Indians."     If you do a little research in the proper places, you can find a great deal about the Wehrmacht composition. As for helping out the prisoners in the concentration camps, I'm pretty certain that low ranking conscripts in the Wehrmacht were never told of the atrocities.

You might also like Vanishing Acts, Keeping Faith, Plain Truth and Harvesting the Heart. She is one of my favorite authors and I think the only book I didn't like as much as the others was Salem Falls. Hope this helps you choose your next one!
Bgqi0pOuaa	He's talking about someone going from the bank to a place called the Flower Pot".  It is here they are able to "secure a place for..."  I am imaging Dalston and Shacklewell are people (previously mentioned?).    The Flower Pot may be a pub or store of some kind.  I don't know much in the way of old-fashioned British commerce, but I imagine a tavern keeper might have rooms or cottages to let to folks?  Whatever it is, in this context is sounds like a place where a rental transaction takes place.    It would help to see the next few lines to get the complete context.  Does he go on to talk about this place that's been rented?
a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	Bravo to BENTHEBUS... There are NO sites that will have your entire family history, unless they were compliled BY Your family.    TRUE Family History requires YEARS of digging and research.    The websites everyone mentions are derived from public records:  birth certificates, death records, marriage records, etc.    BUT I wouldn't trust one of those sites for dates prior to about 1850... too many lost / burned records.    My Dad took our family back to Scotland 1612 on his side, but dead-ended on Mom's side in 1904 (the records in German were lost).  This involved YEARS of talking with grandparents, gathering letters, photos... then trekking to County Offices to get copies of records.

Prairie fires, storms, Indian raids, rustlers, bugs, snakes...    Note that "the Drives" begin in 1866, just after the Civil War. The also END in about 1890 with the addition of more rail lines.  The drive of 1866 runs into trouble with Eastern Kansas farmers. Afraid that the Texas longhorns will spread fever to the local cattle and trample their crops, they blocked the drive (with gun-fire and such fun).

LVZdzPmpaa	If you have a completed manuscript and need an editor, I can help you there. Email me and we'll talk.    In order to secure representation, you must first have a salable manuscript (edited and polished to perfection). Then you have to find an agent who not only deals in manuscripts like yours but one who is taking on new clients. You also want to query an agent who has had some success. (Anybody can be a literary agent. It takes no particular skill and a lot of hacks are out there tying up writers for no good reason.)    There are a number of directories that list literary agents with contact info and relevant info. Jeff Herman's is one of the best. Most public libraries have a copy at the reference desk.    Cobra is mistaken with the advice to send an unedited manuscript around to publishers. Publishers do not provide editorial services the way they did years ago; they expect a manuscript to come in needing nothing more than a cursory review. (This is how the mess that it "Twilight" ended up getting published.)    Cobra is further confused about payment for services. Editors get paid in a contract for services. No legitimate literary agent takes any money (rep fees, reading fees or othewise) up-front. The arrangement is that the agent will be paid a percent of the sale of the manuscript.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	Submit your work to a publisher. If they think it is good, they will help with editing and then you get yourself an agent. The writing always comes first.  Don't trust anyone who wants money up front for services, they will be conning you.
yTjVHsriaa	Sometimes a President who doesn't meddle with everything is a good thing! Let's see, Wilson gifted us with a stupid war that led to another one, he was racist (barring Blacks from Federal jobs they had historically held such as Customs inspector in New Orleans,postmasters in towns with majority African populations) and he brought us the Palmer raids which violated the civil rights of any American who didn't have the same opinion as Thomas Woodrow Wilson. This is my personal opinion but Wilson was a frankly odious human being despite his impressive education. People had good reason to vote his party out in 1920.     I recommend you read a book called Lies My Teacher Told Me. It was quite an eye opener for me.      Good Luck!|`|ClGxicdsaa	Just try to make it sound like Coolidge was like Reagen.

yTjVHsriaa	Sail or Steam? Also a ship carrying people from China would be more likely to take them to a West Coast port than NYC. It was even more so back then before the building of the Panama Canal. You'd either have to go around one of the Capes (Horn or Good Hope) or pay money to go through the Suez. And as a sailor trust me when I say most shipping companies are run by cheapskates who wouldn't spend money without being able to make a lot more!! Also a lot of cargo ships would also have passenger accommodations too. For the trip itself,a sailing ship would probably take roughly 5 to 6 months and a steamer would be three to four months. These would depend upon the vagaries of weather especially for a wind powered ship, the quality of coal for a steamer and whether they had other stops along the way and how long the stevedores took to load and unload in those ports.|`|5VqxkMFuaa	Whichever way it went, a boat carrying immigrants from China to New York would take the best part of six months, including stops in various ports of call. From China to San Francisco (a much more likely scenario), it might take between six and twelve weeks.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Chinese immigrants landed at San Francisco. They had an immigration site there also for a while. That is why SF had such a huge Chinese population and China town. Several towns all up and down California coast had China towns. I grew up in Salinas and ours was about two blocks long. Most white people were afraid to go there.|`|kacLYFrHaa	would depend on the type of boat and the route taken. Immigrant's from China would have normally been routed through the west coast, San Fransisco most likely (Angel Island in San Fransisco Bay served the same purpose from 1910 to 1940 as Ellis Island in New York Harbor), however that's not to say some might not have tried sailing for New York. So there would be three options for a route to New York from China:    1. Sail east across the Pacific Ocean, rounding South America at Cape Horn and passing into the Atlantic Ocean then sailing north to New York.    2. Sail south until you can pass west into the the Indian Ocean then continue sailing west, rounding Africa at the Cape of Good Hope and passing into the Atlantic Ocean before sailing northwest to New York.    3. Sail south until you can pass west into the the Indian Ocean then continue sailing west, but instead of rounding the Cape of Good Hope turn north once near Africa and pass into the Red Sea then pass through the Suez Canal (opened in 1869) into the Mediterranean Sea then through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic Ocean and then northwest to New York.    Figure the first and third options would take at least a couple months, maybe a little less, but the second option would take the most time.

7igxiGrAaa	Publishing company often publish books from other countries. I know a lot of books in the united states are actually published in London.  How to get published depends on the publishing company. You would have to look into their specifics, major publishing houses require an agent.  But yes, you can get it published in English by a company that is not where you live.  Here is a guide on getting published:  http://www.fearlessbooks.com/PublishingG...  I'm not sure if you have copyrights where you live but I would look into that as well. The U.S. has certain guidelines in order to get copyright, but once you are copyright it's illegal for anyone to steal your work, even if you do put it on a website.  Here's the link to the U.S. copyright website, try googling for something in your own country if you have it.  http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.pdf
5N4n5dtoaa	Most likely it's Living Dead Girl, by Elizabeth Scott.<br>  I mean, it's not the most twisted book out there (no way) but it's the creepiest thing I've ever read...<br>  It's about a girl who's kidnapped by a pedophile, and forced to remain like a child throughout her life (he forces her into little-girl dresses, she has a princess bed, etc) and the man who kidnapped her is basically torturing her in a very subtle way...reffering to the title. I can't describe it; it's something you have to read for yourself to see how dark and disturbing it really is. Some parts of it were just....I can't even say. It's also quite depressing.<br>  And here's a way to think of it;<br>  If you've read The Lovely Bones (this isn't a spoiler, it's the plot of the book), then after reading this, you'd be GLAD the man kills the girl in Lovely Bones. Because there are so many things he could've done to her that are so much worse...and they're all in this book.<br>  It was honestly really, really haunting.

I wasn't particularly affected by its graphic extremes though, because they are written at a remove and one never really feels a part of the scenes. There is so much more to it than its violence that it just isn't that hard to read, because of the distance and the surrealness of the settings.<br>  <br>  The book that stands in my mind as the most personally disturbing is Last Exit To Brooklyn by Hubert Selby Jr. In that book you get the feeling that each of these wretched things really did happen and, worse, continues to happen, regularly, to people everywhere.

1NK1hK1Taa	Six months after adoption the little girl gets ill and after a short time, dies. The man is distraught and contemplating suicide. In the meantime, the girl's real mother finally tracks down the orphanage where her little daughter was sent to. Her daughter was taken from her by social services when after being attacked in the street and hit on the head, she went into a coma for nearly two years. Having no relatives to look after her daughter, she was taken away into care after the doctors thought  that she would not regain consciousness. The orphanage gave the mother the address of the man who had adopted her. She rushed around to thank him and to see her daughter for the first time after nearly three years. It had taken her so long to find her little princess. She climbed the steps and hesitated at the door, not knowing what the man was like, how he would react. How her daughter would react. Would she remember her mother? Would she forgive her? She rang the bell and waited. Hardly daring to breath. The door opened. He looked handsome, and kind. Maybe her daughter was being well cared for. Maybe even loved? She introduced herself as the missing mother. The man just started to cry. A tear becoming a torrent of tears. Instinctively she held out her arms and the man held her so tight. What could be wrong? She asked him after he had calmed down enough to speak. She died. He said. They fell in love, got married and she gave him the children he so longed for. At last he had found the wonderful wife and mother he had searched for his whole life.  The End.    OR    She turned out to be possessed and when they went home for the first time she stabbed him when his back was turned and then ate his brains...    You taka your choice:)|`|6uRWoIjJaa	One of his female friends tells him she once put a baby up for adoption. He finds out the little girls d.o.b and place of birth and thinks its his friends baby.

Will she agree to be his 'partner' to help him adopt the little girl? will her feelings be resurected that she is the child's biological mother? will the courts allow her to claim her child when she gave up all rights to her at birth?  End the story with a twist like she fights the courts to regain parental responsibility for her child and the bloke is happy his friend finds her child and is happy to be a mummy finally. ..|`|0WKkXIyKaa	the girl is really a cyborg.    and new york city is really a giant ditch that has mars residing on it.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	I don't think there is a law against single men adopting a child.  And you don't go to court to have a law changed.    That said, I agree with the first guy about the child being his long lost daughter.  That would make it a bit like O Henry.  Of course, it is rather predictable.    How about the director of the orphanage having a special bond with the girl?  Maybe that's why she is willing to obstruct his attempts to "take the child away from her".  Through the course of the struggle, they learn to respect each other and eventually fall in love.  Then the path is really clear for adoption and a happily ever after for the little girl.    I dunno.  Just throwing things out there.    EDIT:  I've never seen any of the Olson twins' films but it's possible.  Their plots are rather generic, I understand.|`|gd0KxmUAaa	the man put the girl up for adoption many years ago, but lost contact. and hey he found her again!|`|5nqQLkbxaa	The girl has had a terrible past.  You could write random chapters in the third person about her early life and how her pearents died.  Dot them around the book to make it more interesting|`|AA10015648	It's a good idea, but in order to make it more realistic you might need to do some research.    1) Research the adoption process. It's a process that takes YEARS, not days.     2) Research adoption laws. Unless you're making this story happen before 1970, your "single parent adoption" law is not correct. It's perfectly legal for single parents to adopt a child.    3) Orphanages don't really exist like they do in movies. Kids up for adoption usually live in "group homes" which are more like foster homes with 5-10 kids of various ages. Orphanages that are still called orphanages are almost exclusively mental health facilities for children who have no family.    4) I just read the book Martian Child, based on a true story about a single gay man's journey to adopt a son - you should read it, just to see the trials and tribulations it takes to adopt a kid.    If you make the book happen in the past, you'll be more likely to sound realistic. In terms of twists and turns, maybe the girl turns out to be his BIOLOGICAL daughter, and that's why he feels so connected with her.     Or maybe she's his niece or something. Or MAYBE she's not related to him, but in the middle of the adoption process, a DIFFERENT girl shows up, whose mother recently died, and the man is her father! But his biological daughter is really weird and not anything like the other girl, and he has a hard time figuring out what to do    GOOD LUCK! Could be a great story :D

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    A drum is usually miked in a P.A. system to get the best sound possible and to be able to control the Bass drum, cymbals, snare etc... separately.    Shure SM57's on the snare and toms, and an SM58 inside the bass drum.  This set up works pretty good, in fact the natural midrange boost of the SM57's helps give the snare drum and toms a certain punch that help them cut through walls of amplified guitar sound.  An SM58 vocal mike inside the bass drum is definitely a poor choice considering that mike has virtually no frequency response in the 20-40hz range where all of a bass drums' low fundamental pitch lies.      The Sennheiser MD421 is a very popular studio quality mike that has been used for decades in concerts and studio sessions, but they are quite expensive. My preference LOL    The CAD series of drum microphones was designed from the ground up for drum miking purposes and although inexpensive, they are not garbage. The package comes in a nice case with 5 or 6 mikes, each designed for bass, snare, toms, cymbals etc...      Usually, a drummer uses monitors to hear himself and the other musicians. Otherwise, he will be lost and won't be able to follow the music. That is why you see many drummers with headphones so they can what is going on. The sound system is either rented by the band with a technician available to balance the instruments.    Here is a good link...    http://www.drumjunction.com/drum_monitor...|`|QE71sNC3aa	You would only want to mic your drums for better quality recording using a mixer or for a larger gig where your drums would be run into the mixer / PA system / monitor system used by the vocalist and other musicians. Some venues supply a PA... Some bands own one... Some bands rent...    Drums should be loud enough to keep up with any other musicians playing through just an amp. If there's a small PA available, it's usually used mainly by the vocalist. If there's a large PA system, usually everyone's run through it.|`|eZiOe9kFaa	YOU RUN YOUR DRUM MICS THROUGH THE PA BOARD SOME TIMES A DRUMMER WILL HAVE THERE OWN BOARD TO RUN ALL THE MICS TO AND THEN SEND A MONO OR STEREO SIGNAL TO THE BOARD.HERES HOW I SET UP.SNARE MIC SHOULD BE CLOSE TO THE HATS TO DO DOUBLE DUTY MIC EACH TOM BASS DRUM AND TWO OVER HEAD CONDENSER MICS TO CATCH THE CYMBALS.THAT IS FOR A LARGER VENUE USUALY IN SMALLER BARS A KICK MIC WILL DUE.FOR RECORDING THE SAME AS THE FIRST BUT KEEP THE SNARE MIC AWAY FROM THE HATS.ALWAYS SET THE MICS UP ON THE TOP HEADS ABOUT 1 INCH OR LESS AWAY FROM THE HEAD.HOPE THAT HELPS.N

5XJ3Nu8aaa	Well, I suppose it matters how often you'll use it. If you only have a few sounds that you really like, and they are all on the regular floor pod, then... there's your answer right there. But if you like to experiment around with your sound, the floor pod plus is a better deal. I'm personally gonna get a plus to go with my new amp. Line 6 is known for high- gain sounds, but I've heard good clean tones out of it on some reviews. The best thing I can tell you to do is to go to a music store that has both and see what you like more.

23F70N1Raa	Ok, because you want to go for photography it is hard just to pick out the top 10 or 20 because most colleges/universities do have a photography department (even our local community college has a decent photography department).  So, the best way to look into a photography school is to go beyond looking up the colleges themselves and start looking into your favorite photographers.  Look up your top 10 or 20 photographers (the ones that you look up to as far as style, artistic abilities and popularity) and find out where they went to school.  This will give you a good idea of where you should start looking at schools.  Here is the reason, if you attend a university, they are going to tell you how to use your camera, photoshop, developing etc.  However, they are going to teach you with THEIR view on how photography should be done.  Some universities may not be very subjective to your own "style".  So, on top of wanting to find a good university, you want one that will have the flexibility to allow you to experiment and create your own style of photography.  It is the photographers that are a bit different that are a step above the rest... so you want to find a school that will let you do this.  So, again, research your fav. photographers (wikipedia.com is a great resource for this, but please remember that the info. on there is not peer reviewed so it is not considered a "reputable site"... yet the info. is valuable and usually acurate... just don't use it for your school thesis) and their institutions of study.  From there, you can narrow down your search of schools and research them independantly.  Any school will boast that they have the best department for this, that or the other thing... you want to find the school that is both a match to your accademic abilities and your creative abilities.  With that, I can not offer you the best list of schools because I do not know you personally.  I wish you the best of luck, photography is a hard art to get into... but all arts are tough career choices.  Stay with your heart, and it will never steer you in the wrong direction.|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	Have you tried collegeboard.com?|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Here are the three top in the US<br>  <br>  Art Center   <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.artcenter.edu</a><br>  Brooks   <a href="http://wwwlbrooks.edu" rel="nofollow">http://wwwlbrooks.edu</a><br>  RIT   <a href="http://www.rit.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.rit.edu</a>
9e8FfX7Faa	Shove painting the roofs white.<br>  <br>  Why don't we just paint China white.<br>  that will get rid of global warming.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Good idea. We will follow. When it  is in the interest of everybody.<br>  Thanks.|`|1fB2UdRHaa	It would have an effect, probably not that much of an impact, considering the number of homes with black or very dark roofs, but it would not stop global warming. It would take a large number of things to ultimately stop global warming. <br>  <br>  It's similar to this: cows produce a large amount of green house gases, killing all the cows would make a difference too.|`|EKmXACCIaa	The principle works at least, because white reflects light radiation away and prevents it from being absorbed into the ground as heat.<br>  <br>  An issue related to this happened many hundreds of millions of years ago in a period called "Snowball Earth" where the entire surface froze, and the more the planet froze, the faster the temperature dropped because all the light falling on earth from the sun was reflecting back into space. If it wasn't for the eruption of some monster volcanos, Earth may still have been a frozen ball of ice today,<br>   <br>  But you could never now paint enough of the Earth's surface white to make much of a difference. Even if every scrap of land was white, there would not be enough energy reflected back to offset all emissions so its a futile endeavor. However! It will help to keep the house nice and cool in the summer! <br>  <br>  Ideas based on this concept though have been thought of, usually along the lines of lining the upper atmosphere with energy absorbing compounds, but it would be rather drastic, let alone expensive. <br>  <br>  So you could paint your roof white, but using a little less electricity or gas would be much more effective.|`|AA11219693	I bring out my solar powered calculator from the old wooden chest and do some calculations, for we all would be calculating soon as how many kilo joules of energy doe it take to cook an omelette.<br>  <br>  This is brilliant suggestion that demonstrates the presence of an environmental friendly, creative and pragmatic mind. This show that we are concerned, we have ability and we are ready to do something to make this world a better, or will it be more appropriate to say that, to avert a looming catastrophe. I appreciate your suggestion before I delve into the reality of the situation and see if it really is a feasible solution to the problem.<br>  <br>  First of all, let me recap: Global warming is a direct consequence of us, as mainly in the west, burning too much fossil fuel, causing greenhouse gases to unnaturally add to the atmosphere, causing the polar ice to melt, causing a dramatic reduction of white reflecting surfaces on the face of the planet, and causing you to come up with your brilliant idea, right?<br>  <br>  Now, I see that most roof surfaces are going to be reserved for solar panelling, to produce green energy in the future. Besides, the amount of paint required to paint all roof white first, and then keeping it white indefinitely, is an act which would require lots of burning of energy of some sort in paint factories, thus, costing more energy wise. I am sorry but you will have to think harder next time!<br>  |`|WseLyvSpaa	Better idea:  Cover your roof with light absorbing solar cells and convert the sunlight into electricity to run your appliances.|`|de2a032fd31864b266f9f88bfb56b71eaa	Global warming is a purely natural phenomenon.

f6H3shKYaa	I giapponesi hanno gli  occhi a mandorla con un tratto più definito e obliquo, più grandi, e non hanno quella specie di rigonfiamento della parte tra palpebra e sopracciglio. La pelle spesso è più chiara, mentre i cinesi hanno una pigmentazione che va dall'olivastro al giallino. Per entrambi la statura è mediamente bassa, anche se nella nuova generazione la media si sta alzando. I capelli sono in entrambi i casi liscissimi e scuri, il colore degli occhi resta rigorosamente nero (o marrone scuro al massimo). Altra differenza è nella forma cranica: il cranio di un cinese è più grande, e presenta un naso un po' più schiacciato.|`|2xPGs5nVaa	Guarda, senza che ti sto a descrivere tanto, ti linko due pagine di ricerca con foto di giapponesi<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.it/images?gbv=2&hl=it&q=giapponesi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.it/images?gbv=2&hl=...</a><br>  <br>  e di cinesi <br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.it/images?gbv=2&hl=it&q=%22cinesi%22" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.it/images?gbv=2&hl=...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  così vedi bene quali sono le differenze somatiche<br>  Ciao!|`|mSC3kVPBaa	Per chi non li vede spesso è difficile distinguerli.<br>  Io li distinguo bene visto che li vedo fin da piccolo, e comunque non ci sono delle differenze inquadrabili.<br>  Non è vero che i cinesi sono più scuri dei giapponesi.<br>  I giapponesi in genere sono più magri(a causa della differente alimentazione), hanno gli occhi più tondi(ma anche i cinesi del sud hanno gli occhi tondi), gli anziani sono molto bassi, e hanno i capelli più scuri dei cinesi(sembrerà strano per gli occidentali ma i cinesi spesso non hanno capelli nerissimi come i giapponesi).<br>  La cosa che li distingue di più è la diversa aurea che si portano intorno... ma è difficile da spiegare.<br>  Inoltre ci sono molti cinesi che sembrano giapponesi e vice versa!<br>  <br>  <br>  In generale però i cinesi fisicamente somigliano di più agli occidentali.|`|1j6RTsw5aa	fallo scrivere..<br>  una delle due lingue scrive in orizzontale e una in verticale..<br>  devi solo scoprire quale k nn me lo ricordo!!|`|5hL6G6CPaa	i cinesi sono sempre con la macchina fotografica in mano<br>  mentre i giapponesi no|`|zA1NjZYgaa	io li riconosco perchè di solito i cinesi sono più spesso tutti uguali, e hanno la faccia più larga xD|`|VCXZlnnFaa	basta vedere com'e vestito.. i giapponesi vestono marche auliche, i cinesi no.. poi il colore della pelle i giapponesi sono piu bianchi rispetto ai cinesi, ed infine dovrebbero esserci anche delle differenze somatiche ma nn le so|`|mRHe90sPaa	i cinesi sono + bassetti e si assomigliano tutti. <br>  i giapponesi hanno dei tratti somatici + simili ai nostri, sono + alti, col viso + squadrato...<br>  mi sembra!!!<br>  so x certo xò ke i giapponesi sono molto + gnocchi!!!
4FWrRRF2aa	Well WW1 was when the British Army was largest.    British power though was in its Navy.|`|ANzszvWRaa	There may be two answers to your question - firstly, when was the "peak" of British military power and how large was its army at that time; second, how large was it at it greatest strength.    The answer to the second of these has to be World War 1, with the total of volunteers and conscripted men reaching almost 5 million.    The first is more open to argument. It could be said that the peak of the British Army has to be linked to the peak of the Empire under Queen Victoria - but at that time the Army was tiny compared with its European neighbours. What has to be remembered is that Imperial forces (Australian, Canadian, Indian and so on) increased the total available manpower to a very high level - but of course most of these were not British.

She says she wouldve killed Duncan herself, if he hadnt looked so much like her father in his sleep. (Apparently, now shes all family values.)        * Macbeth enters with bloody hands.        * Macbeth says two people woke up while he was in the act. One cried, "Murder!" but they both went back to sleep after saying their prayers. Macbeth is disturbed that he couldnt say "Amen" when they said, "God bless us," as he could have used the blessing, given how he recently damned his soul by killing the King.    http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/w...

FdmzS9Fdaa	Slow and controlled. Alot of people try to play tremelo on the high E string, and have their fingers fly. Recuerdos has the tremelo on the B string, which means if you play with your fingers reckless, you will hit the High E string. Get a Metronome, play some arpeggios with the tremelo and take it slow. <br>  <br>  Once you've gotten the hang of it, play the tremelo backwards (i,m,a rather than a,m,i) once you can kind of get the hang of it, play it the right way and your tremelo will flow like butter. The reason is, people tend to put too much strength into the lead finger (i) and what happens is your tremelo will end up sounding like a BAM, bam bam... switching up the order will put emphasis on your ring finger (a) and when you go back to the true pattern, it will balance your sound out.<br>  <br>  Beautiful song, good luck!

AfaFCiKxaa	Biggest one:  They'd need to know how to read -- not too common in those days.    Also, they'd need to have a quick facility with memorization.  The theatres in those days performed a different play every day, and it might be weeks or months before a particular play was repeated, so the actors would have to be very facile and smart.|`|abc10c081ca55f358d27b9acde1ea0b7aa	Check out the qualities an actor has at the first part of this link.

In a future dystopia, cities have become for-profit businesses. Orphanages are not exempt from the struggle to make money, and at the Clarissa Frayne Institute for Parentally Challenged Boys, kids are forced to endure product testing and frequently end up injured as a result. With orphans facing an average life expectancy of 15, 14-year-old Cosmo Hill knows that he is on borrowed time. Unfortunately, his escape attempt nearly proves fatal. While he's lying there dying, a small, hairless blue creature lands on his chest and begins to feed. He is rescued by the Supernaturalists, a motley crew of young people who have dedicated their lives to destroying the Parasites, which feed on the essence of the living. Cosmo joins the group as a Spotter, someone who can actually see the creatures and thus destroy them. However, facts soon emerge that cause the Supernaturalists to question everything they believe in. Is it possible that the Parasites don't feed off of the energy of dying people, but remove pain? Are they actually beneficial to society?"|`|UMyyuEvRaa	its "The Supernaturalist" by Eion Colfer    thats a great book.     and ditto is a midget cuz of a lab accident|`|Y0ffbZKraa	I'm really not sure, but it sounds vaguely like The World Jones Made by Phillip K.

If you don't, you should so you get the gist of how it's written and stuff. Figure out in what person you want to write it in...1st? 2nd? 3rd? Once you've figured that out, you can start writing. How do you want to begin the story? Where do you want to start? In what location? Describe your main character, location, etc...Books usually have a beginning (where it starts off slow) a middle (where it starts to get good and suspenseful) a peak (something major happens) and an end...I know there are vocab words for these I just can't think of them at the moment. |`|aan2EVoJaa	try to do it in ur computer and after it may be someone who will discover u|`|c84ff0f70ed4684dae9c5794cee47dc0aa	share your view with me,buzz me on my id vishu_bharal by yahoo massanger|`|2APssjXBaa	I am am writing a bool also done  5 pages, what you should do first is name it and then read a novel to get whats the basic part of writing, write dow some interesting words and begin on your first page.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|UvyPRje4aa	 to convert ur thoughts into words take consultance fronur elders ...............<br>  ..........................and bout how to write a book u need a pen a page and bundles of <br>  imagination !!|`|6ztw9zLkaa	go to the library and pick any random novel and read it, it should give you some ideas on how to start |`|FoIxsunVaa	Put down one word.

cZfCw2UAaa	If you want a clean crisp line, you want to get some contact paper, or shelf liner, which has less adhesive and is easier to remove, (or they have masking materials in art stores) and apply it to the canvas where you want it to be covered.  You can use paper and tape to protect big areas between the masking.  Be tedious and get it exactly how you want it, then spray as lightly as you can and still cover.  Don't even think about touching it till its dry.  Have an exacto knife handy when you pull the masking material incase you need it to preserve your shape. If you wanted brighter color, you may also want to use a sharpee very carefully.  The brush would work, but you would have to be really smooth, and careful.  :o)|`|gXYwWc5zaa	I would say you might use masking and a brush,or masking and airbrush.The bib differnts is the air brush will not leave brush marks.
9BxeiEzZaa	Don't know what kind of paint you are using.Most Art stores stock cotton or linen canvases.Both are good for Acrylics or oils.Masking is usually used in watercolours where you mask the areas which will remain white on the paper.The masking comes in liquid form.You pull it off when the painting is done.For oils or Acrylics,If you use a wood or Masonite panel sanded smooth and coated with a smooth application of Gesso,you won't see the brush strokes,provided you use thinner brush strokes.It's pretty hard not to see brush strokes if you use more of an Impasto technique.There's so much to learn.Don't give up.Find some good how to books at the library.Practice. Experiment.Have fun.Don't be afraid to break rules.
d7mFbjdAaa	I agree with one thing that MPA said: you have to write a really great story.<br>  <br>  Please don't pay to have anything professionally printed. It will not help. All you need is a well written, properly formatted manuscript which you can print from your own computer. <br>  <br>  Also, the children's publishing industry is different from mainstream publishing in that you do not necessarily need a literary agent. Some editors will accept unsolicited or unagented submissions. Not all, but some will. Look for these editors in the Children's Writers and Illustrators Market, which is published yearly.<br>  <br>  If you do choose to look for an agent, be sure to find a reputable one that has experience with books for children. Finding an agent who likes your work is just about as difficult as finding an editor who likes your work. Some writers look for an editor first, then when you have an editor who likes your manuscript, you can more easily find an agent who is willing to represent you. Some writers decide to look for an agent first since agents have better access to editors. It's up to you.<br>  <br>  Here are some ideas that might help you get started:<br>  <br>  1) Join the Society for Children's Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI). Their newsletters will help you learn about the industry. Through SCBWI, you can connect with children's writers in your area.<br>  www.scbwi.org<br>  <br>  2) Do some internet research. Here are some excellent websites for starters:<br>  <br>  www.write4kids.com<br>  www.verlakay.com<br>  www.underdown.org<br>  <br>  3) Become an expert on children's books. Take children's lit classes online or at your nearest community college. Read lots of books for kids, especially the kind you would like to write. Talk to librarians in the children's section for advice about what to read. <br>  <br>  4) Write, write, write! Get your stories down on paper and keep writing.|`|cWl5pJ01aa	Get a copy of the writer's market they tell you how to do that. <br>  <br>  Here's a link. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buy.com/prod/novel-short-story-writers-market/q/loc/106/204317458.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buy.com/prod/novel-short-stor...</a>|`|1VYprmjkaa	Well first off you obviously have to be able to write something that is really good.<br>  <br>  Second, you must get it printed and press yourself and make what we music people refer to as a 'press kit' (google it) and just modify it to fit your aspiring book career.<br>  <br>  Then you need to make sure your copyrights of the material are secured (I suggest legalzoom) and after that the hardest part.<br>  <br>  You will need to find a literary agent who is on good terms with publisher houses and you will need your literary agent to pitch your 'press kit' to publishers and coax them into publishing your book.<br>  <br>  A lot of times, you have to have money to push a book by yourself unless you find a publisher who is bonkers about your book and they will pay for it all themselves and you will sign a royalty payment contract.<br>  <br>  But that, my friend is how you do it.
DtK69kS2aa	Well when the book starts off one of the main characters Cathy is dead. <br>  <br>  Mr. Lockwood sees Cathy's name written all over the windowsill and then has a haunting dream about her. When he mentions the dream to Heathcliff, Heathcliff becomes very upset. Mr. Lockwood wants to know why the mention of Cathy upsets him.<br>  <br>  The flashbacks are a way 'bring Cathy back to life' so Mr. Lockwood has a better understanding of why Heathcliff was so upset. The Flashbacks show the progression of the love that Heathcliff & Cathy had for each other grew and how their poor decisions tore them apart. It wouldn't have been the same if it was just Ellen telling Mr. Lockwood that Cathy was a person that Heathcliff loved and that she died.

Dallas was a delinquent, and Johnny was the only person he really cared about, since Johnny's parents didn't care for him. Dallas felt it was his responsibility to guide Johnny, and with him gone Dallas felt really depressed and that there was no point for him to be living.|`|Am41pAGYaa	Because Ponyboy originally starts by having hallucinations, he doesn't let himself believe that Johnny is really dead and by the time he finally grasps the fact that Johnny really died he has had some time to calm himself down.

TPpe10fTaa	expand your details and remind me of whats in the chp. <br>  ive read its several times and seen the movies 100s<br>  
pt6wIlS1aa	Thanks for giving a very clear description, with examples, of what you're looking for. I wish everyone would do this when they ask for book suggestions!<br>  <br>  It makes me wish I read romances, so I could give you some good recommends, but I rarely read them. Well, here's my best effort for you:<br>  <br>  Classic romances:<br>  <br>  Dr. Zhivago by Boris Pasternak is considered one of the all-time great romances. It's set during the Russian Revolution.<br>  <br>  Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is set against the American Civil War.<br>  <br>  One that I read years ago and found very powerful is Csardas, by Diane Pearson. Set around 1914, it takes place in Hungary or Poland. It's not in publication today, but your library may have it or may be able to get it for you via inter-library loan.<br>  <br>  Centennial by James Michener takes you through the history of a place, Centennial, Colorado. It includes a few good romances as part of the story.<br>  <br>  The Winds of War and War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk is a saga, including romance, during WWII. Excellent, thought-provoking.<br>  <br>  Exodus by Leon Uris is set during the birth of Israel. Again, romance isn't the main focus, but there is great romance in it. <br>  <br>  Colleen McCullough is a wonderful writer of thought-provoking romances. Her best-known book is probably The Thorn Birds. If you want an unlikely love object, try her first book, Tim.<br>  <br>  If a dozen ravening teenage girls haven't already recommended Twilight by Stephenie Meyer to you, I will. Yes, the characters are in high school and it's marketed to young adults, but this has become a bestseller among women of all ages. The love story is just very, very good.<br>  <br>  Probably these won't have as much lust as you're looking for. Somehow "lust" and "thought-provoking" don't make it into the same books very often.|`|0cc6cc7ea62da6702f552d8f61bc21feaa	The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger.  <br>  <br>  Possession: A Romance by A.S. Byatt.<br>  <br>  Both of these books are quite challenging and are not genre romances.  They are beautiful literary love stories.  Possession in particular is intellectually demanding, but well worth it.  <br>  <br>  If you don't mind lesbian love, try Sarah Waters' Fingersmith.  |`|NhPSz1kHaa	The Girl With the Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier<br>  The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory<br>  <a href="http://books4teensandadults.googlepages.com/recent" rel="nofollow">http://books4teensandadults.googlepages....</a><br>  <br>  Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy<br>  Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell<br>  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen<br>  Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte<br>  Emma by Jane Austen<br>  Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen<br>  Mansfield Park by Jane Austen<br>  <a href="http://books4teensandadults.googlepages.com/girls" rel="nofollow">http://books4teensandadults.googlepages....</a>|`|1ehetidJaa	Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen.A classic!|`|AA10676702	I'm not sure what you'd think of her but my favorite has always been Victoria Holt. Historical Romance is the genre her work is under but she could use suspense/thriller/mystery/romance and roll it into one.<br>  <br>  Some of her books can be predictable but the romance is always passionate, the characters are original and she was always very good about detailing the location and history of the story. I've never found a book of hers that I could put down.<br>  <br>  My personal favorite is Pride of the Peacock. Though I do have a few others to suggest off of the top of my head:<br>  <br>  The Silk Vendetta<br>  The Black Opal<br>  The Shivering Sands<br>  The Time of the Hunter's Moon<br>  The India Fan<br>  Lord of the far Island<br>  King of the Castle<br>  <br>  A lot of her books are now out of print but you can find them on Amazon.com or in your local bookstore. She also wrote under the pseudonyms Philippa Carr and Jean Plaidy. <br>   <br>  And no, she was not a harlequin novelist. She knew how to dig into your heart without getting overly raunchy.<br>  <br>  I would recommend her to any hopeless romantic.<br>  <br>  If you want something a bit different you could try Anne Rice's The Mummy. It IS a romance though it doesn't sound like it would be.|`|9dsulsybaa	All Jane Austen books will be perfectly suited for your taste.<br>  Also have you read the Great and Terrible Beauty sequels?|`|TfY6z6kkaa	Atonement<br>  <br>  I agree Vannah... definitely Pride and Prejudice!!!|`|ctgtSMiPaa	There's one called 'Scandal's Bride'.

It's...strange.|`|d5xtxBjNaa	The one where Bella almost died..|`|ZtECjEPyaa	eclipse so far...i haven't read breaking dawn yet but i am soon =]. is it as good as people say it is though?|`|biheycXqaa	Either Eclipse because it has an equal amount of Edward and Jacob - both of whom I love, though I am on Team Edward.  Or Twilight because that is the only book where Edward and Bella's relationship is somewhat normal (when Jacob comes into the picture, Edward because a little less than obsessed with Bella and vice versa)  I wasn't too fond of New Moon because when Edward left, I cried and the rest of the book (until Edward came back) I felt really depressed - no lie.  Breaking Dawn is okay. But I felt as though it was all leading up to that one crucail point in the clearing and then.... nothing. And the ending was horrible. I think Stephenie Meyer could have come up with a better way to end the series than basically saying "And we lived happily ever after."|`|tOi44Z0paa	mine so far is Twilight, the first one.  t  tw  twi  twil  twili  twilig  twiligh  twilight  twiligh  twilig  twili  twil  twi  tw  t|`|Es56v2Ohaa	the eclipse was my favorite.  breaking dawn seemed to rush by too fast, and the first two didnt have as much action as eclipse.|`|rVgT35AZaa	I really loved New Moon.

Twilight was a little slow to get started, and in New Moon I could honestly feel her utter heart break, it was so awful, it almost hurt to read, but that's what made it so amazing! But yeah, Breaking Dawn is my favorite.|`|QCbztg1Gaa	i think mines would have to be twilight and new moon  breaking dawn to me was good but i didn't like that to be the end of the series but i like the ending of the book ( i don't know if that made sense) lol  i mean there so many things i want to know about like with Renesme and jacob|`|aaNZZKLraa	Fave: Either Twilight or New Moon.

AA12290150	He has little chance of getting a collection of his stories published in book form unless he is well known already. The next best solution is for you to visit your library and borrow a copy of writer's market, make a list of literary magazines that publish in his genre, and submit some stories to them. If he really is good, they will publish them.

He does not need to copyright the stories (they're already copyrighted). He does not need to spend any money beyond postage.<br>  <br>  What he does need to do is identify potential markets. He should browse the magazine stands and the periodicals sections of large bookstores, seeking ones that publish fiction in the same genre as his own. He should buy an issue or two and read the stories in their entirety, so he knows how his compare.<br>  <br>  He can also buy Writer's Market to tap other markets he didn't find at magazine stands.<br>  <br>  For each potential market, he should find the writers'/authors' guidelines (sometimes called submission guidelines) and follow them exactly, from what to enclose to story format. Then it's all waiting, mostly for rejection.<br>  <br>  While he waits he should, of course, be writing more stories.|`|f8ae3465e6233b75e731b60b18d69aa0aa	Submit some of the stories to agents.

tiKEy7uraa	Yes you can. I can give you few ideas.    Similarities: poor, orphaned, independent girls working as teacher/governess, finding love and self-awareness    Differences: Jane is more sanguine and her development is studied through conflicting qualities/persons in her life while Lucy Snowe's progress is more slow and linear.   Lucy is a narrator not as open and sincere or trustworthy as Jane because she either doesn't know herself or wants to presents herself as something else. She is more near to pathology also.   Their lives are dramatic in different ways. They both have tragic events in their lives (Lucy doesn't say the whole tale) but Lucy's tragical life is sad because nothing ever happens to her. She stays a watcher of the lives of others while Jane Eyre is always in the center of our attention even when she is not participating in the action.

	true. the railroads all ran on times based on a clock in 1 terminal. there was no standard for timekeeping. each town used some clock for the correct time or used the sun to tell time. chaos for railways and passengers. noon is when the sun is directly overhead, but that varies, depending on your location. noon comes earlier the farther east you travel, because the sun rises in the east. also, before automatic signaling for train control, the engineer ran by his watch. he knew he was supposed to reach a certain point by a certain time. timekeeping varied, so there was a greater chance of head-on collisions on single track roads.|`|	true
	Purely in the context of industrialization, I'd have to go with B, since railroads provided access to inland deposits of raw materials including fuels such as coal and oil, as well as minerals ranging from copper and iron to borax that otherwise required horse-drawn freight transport to reach those canals and rivers.

AA11784502	Hi !<br>  His childhood was against one of the most difficult times for the Roman Republic but not "the" most turbulent backdrop '<br>  Caesar's formative years were a time of turmoil. The Social War was fought from 91 to 88 BC between Rome and her Italian allies over the issue of Roman citizenship, while Mithridates of Pontus threatened Rome's eastern provinces. Domestically, Roman politics was divided between politicians known as optimates and populares, neither of which had a common agenda and so cannot be considered a political party or even a faction. The optimates were those politicians who pursued their agendas through traditional, constitutional routes in the Senate; the populares those who preferred to bypass traditional procedure and pursue their agendas by appealing directly to the electorate. Caesar's uncle Marius was a popularis, Marius' protégé Lucius Cornelius Sulla was an optimas, and in Caesar's youth their rivalry led to civil war.<br>  <br>  =^,,^=

hJP9y6kjaa	Simple answer = NO.    A major scale = A major diatonic scale = A B C  D E F  G  A    A minor pentatonic = A C E G A    The difference is that the minor pentatonic scale has different, and fewer, notes.      Saul|`|47c479f2304b0788f9cb6367693718d5aa	Um....I do know a bit about music theory,  having a masters in it helps.  but I don't recall anything about a minor pentatonic scale.  In fact, there is no such thing.  A pentatonic scale consists of,from the tonic ( A in this case) a whole step (B), another whole step (C ) a step and a half (E) another whole step (F ) then back down.  If you flat the third you no longer have a pentatonic scale.  You have pretty much nothing.  The A scale consists of A, B, C ,D,E,F ,G ,A.  While it contains the notes of the A Major scale, skip the 4th. creating the augmented second that is needed for the pentatonic scale.    Personally I see no relationship beyond what is found on a piano keyboard by accident.|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    Obviously, the A major scale is in the same key as the A minor pentatonic except that the minor scale has a flat third & flat 7.    edit..... their is such a thing as Minor Pentatonic b3 and b7. Do your homework.  The diatonic scale is most familiar as the major scale or the "natural" minor scale (or aeolian mode).

3eRDHl4Saa	I love both. Twilight actually made me love music more for some reason. I love music more than Twilight though. I always listen to soft songs, classical music, and jazz music. It's so soothing. Reading can also be fun--I just started reading Pride and Prejudice again because it's a great book.|`|sRw9oiQdaa	I think a certain population of teens like Twilight, but all like music (albeit different kinds of music).|`|5t0DYU6Baa	I love both, really.  When I'm not sleeping, I read or I listen to music.  I can't do both at the same time though, unfortunately.|`|uFXote5Paa	I actually like both.  But most people, I think, like music better. They always think us readers are "nerds" its so stupid.  I cant live without either of them because I love them both. :)|`|AA11703549	Teens can be rather versatile. I've taught 6th grade and vampire novels seemed to be on all the desks (or Naratuo). The young adult genre is really starting to boom and teens are getting into reading more because they're finding stuff that they actually like. It used to be that young adult novels were pretty much the same and if you didn't like the subject, you were screwed.     Music is also very popular with Teens because they've reached the age where emotions are important and they need something that expresses that. It's also a huge part of the pop culture (grab a teen mag. whose on the cover?) and pop culture really acts like a pump going straight into young teen's brains.|`|qlgti3wKaa	You probably won't find a lot teenagers like me. Writing is my life. I have about 45,000 words worth of a book that I am getting ready to get published. And music is my other "life." Because without music, there would be no writing. Writing for me would not exist.     And I'm a Twilight fan, but I'm not overly obsessed like a lot of teenagers are. But yes, I would say that most teenagers are very into music, and a majority of girls are into Twilight.|`|8j70Neqeaa	///=-=-|`|KxdDeO8Taa	I personally luv both, but I'm not a teenagar yet. I don't think i can live without books, but I would die without music as well.|`|MAD7XzCraa	I'm like you with twilight, but i love music too  :)      I can't really speak for any other teens but yeah.|`|SR0hYSqGaa	U cant stick teens into a categorie - some will like music others twilight - most will like like both!|`|zLQLaxhraa	both, but twilight is not life, that book sucks if you ever read anything else youd know|`|9pRe7vx4aa	i love both.  im not exactly the smartest.  average c's in honors classes, but, i love to read.  twilight is just one of the books that all teeange girls like, some boys.  but everyone loves music.|`|FPBsbTLWaa	I hate Twilight with a passion.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	I like reading good, well written books and listening to music.|`|EWiw3ECWaa	Personally I love a mix, but if came down to one or the other, I would have to give up my music for reading, there's nothing like a good book|`|tmwa1oOiaa	I like both, but if I had to choose between the two, i'd pick twilight anyday |`|XQiuY4XIaa	i LOVE music! AND i LOVE reading - especially TWILIGHT!!|`|vJbb0FOZaa	reading love stories for girls and listening to pop music|`|zAcw6nJ9aa	I despise Twilight, but I do love music. It is not my life but I do enjoy listening to music and reading GOOD books any chance I can get.|`|n2KTvPydaa	Personally I like both. They go hand in hand for me. I listen to music while reading. It's just the way I keep my concentration.|`|Y5dRN1BJaa	I would most definately die without books actually.   But, I love music. I could live without it though because recently I'm just not that into it. But I'm not trashing it...because music pretty much describes my life.    I love both though(;
XOgvpDiZaa	If you can afford it and want to keep guitar as a life long hobby, or maybe make a career out of it...GET LESSONS. I've been taking guitar lessons for the past four years (I'm 20), and it's great. I've come a long way from when I first started.    Tips  -Practice everyday at least for 30 minutes (once you get into it you'll lose track of time)  -Your right hand fingers (I'm assuming you have a right handed guitar) will hurt but keep going, unless the pain is really bad then stop  -It's normal to get frustrated  -DON'T start with barre chords (referring to the answerer above me). Your soon-to-be guitar teacher will start you at the very beginning. Or if you're on your own start with learning the string names first, then basic chords (check out cyberfret.com and click on Beginner Guitar Lessons)  -Once you get past the basics and can play simple strumming songs it will be (relatively) smooth sailing from there|`|W2YtVUqKaa	go to your local book star and they should sell this little neat box filled with cards with guitar scales on it. then just practice and strengthen your finger. just a warning when you first start your finger tips are going to blister and peel and it will hurt but after you get through that you should be ok. also youtube has a lot of great lessons too|`|EGIsUJy4aa	Learn your barre chords. I regret not learning those earlier on.  It'll hurt your index finger and pinky but it's worth it, haha.  Your chords will sound fuller :)  Happy playing!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	there is a lot to learn when learning guitar. the first thing that you're gonna wanna do is basic exercises. you can finger each of the frets with each of your fingers and work your way down the strings. this is sort of a strength exercise. you can find many online tutorials for beginners on youtube. just search 'guitar lesson'. also pick up a good book that contains various chords and scales. practice everyday. also check out ultimate-guitar.com

I'll let you work out the rest.|`|QCbztg1Gaa	jacob is upset because he loves bella and thinks Bella would be better for with him not with edward   and he didn't know they were engaged  when he does find out he doesn't even think she should marry edward|`|VHCP9fsAaa	Jacob loves Bella so he was heartbroken that Bella was going to marry the Bloodsucker.
AA11579058	She can't get THAT hot, she's only 13.|`|veeIbyV4aa	You should just take your little sister.  If your 17 now and this will be your fourth year, you probably started going since you were about 13/14.  And, she is 13, so she should probably wouldn't get lost, overheated or anything.    BUT, it might be sorta embarrising for you to be with your younger sister, but if you think its not, then you should just take her.|`|oAOPphQWaa	You should take your little sister... at least you got your cousin to help you
biheycXqaa	Edward told Bella in the beginning of Chapter 15 of Twilight (titled "The Cullens") that "Alice's visions are.... subjective. Things can change." or something like that when Bella had asked if Alice had seen her coming.|`|Es56v2Ohaa	is it clairvoyant?|`|ETGFil1caa	subjective|`|yyfZMWE1aa	Subjective ,  they change depending on peoples decisions|`|0WKkXIyKaa	wasn't it ... queer?|`|3eRDHl4Saa	I know what word you're talking about, but is it subjective? I found it in this quote by Edward:    "She sees things  things that might happen, things that are coming. But its very subjective. The future isnt set in stone. Things change."  Edward Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 14, p.290|`|QCbztg1Gaa	i think they say alice's visions are subjective....      i pretty sure they say that i think|`|9HCypvHJaa	Subjective.

AA11764356	Time can divide all loving souls.    I long to be with those whom I have called friend, but that cannot be so I choose to remain with you.    Their memories linger in my mind, and my soul is darkened by their absence, but I know that they choose to no longer be with me as I have chosen to be with you.    I look back and long for what was, causing me to doubt if my choice has been wise.  I try to imagine myself without you to see if it is truly wise to leave those I have known behind, but I cannot remain divided from you by the times I knew in the past.    I choose to heal this split by loving and moving forward in time with you.|`|0BioKSmaaa	My arms are stretched  As you tug at my soul   Do you know how it feels?  When you never feel whole?   I can love you both  Can't you understand?  This isn't a ball game   I'm not playing underhand   I have a life   Why do you cause all this strife?   Cant you see?   I can love you both   I'll apologize   Stop pulling so hard  Yes, I made mistakes    I neglected your heart   But I'll change, and yes  I believe  I can love you both   I don't want your shadow   I want your face  I don't want innuendos   I want your spoke   So I'll say it again   I can love you both       i dunno..that's what came out, iv never been in that kind of situation so i'm sorry if that didn't really capture the essence of your feelings  hope i helped though :)

AA11712689	War is a huge catalyst for major changes in culture.    WWI & WWII, simply due to the relocation of many European people to other countries including the US and Canada, especially European Jews.    Also a great many African Americans that fought in WWII relocated to France for a better life and less prejudice.    German engineers and scientists (rocket scientists) relocated to Russia and the US after WWII.    The Korean War saw the relocation of Northern Koreans to South Korea, the US, and Australia.    The establishment of Taiwan by mainland Chinese leaving communinst rule.    The French Imperial rule in Indo-China before the Vietnam War.    The American draft dodgers moving to Canada during the Vietnam War.    The relocation of Vietnamese to the US during and after the Vietnam War.    The discovery of oil all across the Middle East.    The West African blood diamond mines.    The India / Pakistan situation.    The Israel / Palistinian situation.    There are really too many historical events from 1900-1980 that have caused a change in culture to list on here.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	World War 1  Great Depression  World War Two  Korean War  Vietnam War  Soviets invading Afghanistan     This is really a broad timeline i just game you somethings though.|`|I1KnBXGtaa	I dont think the time period is broad enough for me to give you an accurate idea of some historical events.
24c53b4b1408a13afb9de7e22c10a1d5aa	Okay, I don't know much but I'm a working actor that auditions all the time, so that's where this is coming from.    1) Most likely they will want you to sing if it's for a musical. Make sure you know what character you're auditioning for and what they sing in the show and that you fit that description. If you're a 16 year old soprano and the character is a 30 year old Alto, then you're not going to be very successful. Don't pick a song from the show you are auditioning for unless the audition specifically calls for it - look for a song from another musical by the same authors that's in the same style and key for your voice to audition with. Pick the best 16 bars (about one page) of the song that highlights your voice talent the best.    2) arrive at least 15 minutes early, preferably 30. Fill out all the paperwork, ask about what you will be asked to do, etc. Have your headshot and resume stapled and ready to go. Be professional, don't chew gum or wear flip flops or look like you just rolled out of bed. If possible, talk to the director or stage manager about the show - this may help you figure out what they're looking for.    3) if it's a musical, there's going to be dancing. Show up in nice clothes (professional) - but bring tights or sweatpants and comfortable shoes that you can dance / move in.    4) as far as hair goes, it should look natural, as should makeup - you should definately look like the headshot you give them. If you have an idea of how the character's hair looks and you can do something similiar without it looking like that's what you're doing, then try that.    5) Don't critique other peoples audition songs or dance skills, or be catty. If your competition is terrible, don't say a word. At least not there in public - no director wants to cast someone that gossips or increases tension in a production.    6) if you have school, work, other shows, etc.. be sure to list CONFLICTS on the sign in paperwork when you get there. Directors hate to cast people then find out that they're leaving for vacation during the last week of rehearsals.    7) be familiar with the play - if they ask who want to audition for and you say "Whatever" or "I don't know" - that shows that you haven't put the effort into taking this seriously.    8) smile, be energetic, and show your personality. If they ask for a volunteer, jump to it - people that are ready and eager to help can be cast over someone who might have more talent, but less energy or drive. If you flub something, or get lost while reading a line, it's okay to tell them that you're a little nervous - it may help to ask the director what their "take" on the character is - this may help you shape your audition to something that they're looking for.    9) Pay attention! Watch other people's auditions and what the director tells them - don't be texting or surfing on your iphone and PLEASE flip it to vibrate or silent while you're at the audition. Most directors can't stand loud, annoying cellphone calls in the middle of an audition.|`|D6KMUndOaa	it doesnt matter how you look or dress. in my recent school news paper they say that there not looking for the best there looking for people who feel confident and are able to fit the part.  so just be your self,|`|yTgTNTGxaa	expecting:  talent  energy  enthusiasm  poise  positivity    wear something comfortable, but not too messy  ponytail, loose bun  sneakers    don't worry- you'll do fine!|`|LjfsANRgaa	Hmm, well, there's a few things they might want you to do.     First of all, you're going to want to pick an audition song. Make sure its age appropriate and shows your range. Don't pick a pop song.    They may expect you to find a monologue. You can find a bunch at www.whysanity.net (they have play and musical and movie monologues).    Wear something nice, but not fancy. Maybe a nice, dark pair of jeans or slacks and a dressy blouse. A skirt works too, as long as it's not too short. Keep the hair and makeup simple, because they're going to need to be envisioning you as the role you're trying out for, and a look too outrageous might distract them.    If you have any other questions at ALL, let me know! I'm pretty experienced with this sort of stuff. I could help you find a song as well, if you'd like.|`|bezgko8Zaa	first of all what you'll look outside:straighten your hair( it makes you look serious about what your doing), don't wear anything tacky or that will show your body off.maybe a  brown skirt, leggings and some light brown boots with a buttoned shirt that's pink (not the hot pink but serene pink) you probably know about the make-up (something that goes with the colors of what your dressing)    second of all,they want you to get there on time . maybe even 30min. earlier. you'll have to sing something. don't challenge yourself. pick something that is easy for you to sing. memorize a script from a broadway show. (comedy,drama,or something passionate.)    hope it helps!!!|`|n9Wu1Omxaa	If it's for a musical, it will most likely involve dancing so wear clothes you can move in! Be presentable, always smile and make sure you look like you want to be there.     Pick a song. Make sure it is either from the show or from the same time period as the show. Make sure the song accentuates your acting abilities. Also, make sure you can sing the song. If someone was auditioning for a show, and they were alto, choosing the song "Glitter and Be Gay" would be a horrible choice. Make sure you have sheet music to bring to your audition! If you have no sheet music, the accompanist will not be able to play your music.     Have a monologue prepared. I give the same advice for a monologue as the advice i give for a song, besides the sheet music part lol. And Memorize the monologue.      Do not ask the auditors anything, state your name, the part you are auditoning for, wait until they are ready and begin. After, say thank you and leave. Don't say "was that bad" "how was i?" that only puts them on the spot. Take this advice and you should be good.|`|A54FZOjQaa	First off you have to dress the role, that is very crucial.  Secondly you have to act the roll, just because its a musical doesn't mean that you don't have to show certain emotions to complete the character you are playing.  Anyways good luck to you.|`|AFtSPEaqaa	just be yourself. honesty is the best policy. wear what you would normally wear and do your hair how you would normally do it. butt try to look decent. act the best you can. break a leg!|`|75hvvxaaaa	Wear something nice, but not a dress or anything. Black pants/ khakis and a nice button down shirt would be nice. Make sure your hair looks neat. Also, at your audition, act confident and outgoing. Be nice to the people around you. The directors will look for that kind of stuff. Be prepared and break a leg!|`|wdYNUJ0Iaa	At my high school audition, we were expected to sing a selection from the actual production, alone.  Then we had to act out part of a scene from the production, in small groups.|`|3hDD45JEaa	i enjoy acting and try to get involved myself some things you mite want keep in mind ..some tips if its kinda yur first scroll for the real answer lol    - watch your voice volume make sure watever stage yur on that yur voice is like a mic hooked up to a speaker filling the room ...be heard ..but not too loud     - different directors and auditions can be can have a different tradition on how they run an audition to pick out thier characters...make sure as soon as you go in there that u get a copy of the script.. skim over some parts and lines and understand the attitudes, the character's personality (ex. is he a guy who is a push around and let things get to him or is he take controll of a situation and is a leader or a bully) this is important for your understanding so that you can get a good part    -wen acting on stage...confidence cant stay in the audience lol..wen yur up there make it seem like its an everyday situation wit yur friends or at work and home wen reading yur lines, apply the idea and attitude of yur favorite jim carrey film or favorite stand up comidean or nick cage movie(depending on the scene) this gives you the chance to make yur imagination to take controll dont wrry bout wat the crowd thinks the time yur up there only wen yur off to find out how yu did ask for some critisizm its the best..    finally for yur answer!! ...... for yu, wear dress casually not too sloppy a decent t shirt shood work ...i say dress and look comfortably dont dress to impress thats a different rehersal.     i hope you do well be confident and be who you wanna be up there..|`|oCXVQWcgaa	They would probably want to hear how your voice sounds (they'll most likely make you sing) and they would want to see you dance (depending on whether or not the musical has a lot of dance).|`|QnguAyy6aa	Act so darn confident and experienced, they'll want to cast you before you even do your scene/monologues or sing.    If the character is younger, wear no makeup, loose clothing and curl your hair. If the character is older, dress less conservatively, and also wear a lot of makeup and straighten your hair.    Whatever you decide to wear, make sure it is very professional and pretty. Also bring dance shoes and clothes to change into, for example, sweats and jazz/character shoes.    I hope you get the part!!!!!!!!!!|`|6kAo5Pwlaa	If you are auditioning for a musical and have not been given any prior material to learn then you will either be expected to perform a monologue/song/dance routine or all of them or if it is workshop style then you will be taught these things on the day of the audition.   Be well prepared to accept and cope with whatever they throw at you. Bring plenty of water and dress in comfortable clothes such as jogging trousers/tracksuit bottoms etc. and trainers/sneakers. Wear your hair in a ponytail or bun and pin your fringe back so it doesn't get in the way or hide your expression at all. Be confident and friendly and remember that the audition panel want you to do well.  Good luck and hope you get the part :)  x

God has given us himself that we may be like him, and he has reserved for himself of power and glory only that which is necessary for the maintenance of those things for the love of which he has thus divested himself of all things else.    5. THE ETERNAL AND DIVINE PURPOSE              There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.              The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending. Everything familiar to us has an end.|`|v1xDXHG5aa	Hi,    God, the author of life, knows. He says:     "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (1)    Related to that, Jesus said, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."

AA10719405	Put a paper bag on that ****, grrl|`|iF92Q2f3aa	You look about the same as my daughter, who is the same age and weight. She's been concerned about her weight, so she's trying to get a lot of exercise and not overeat, but she looks fine. It's just that there are a lot of very skinny girls out there, some with eating disorders and some who are just naturally like that. And pretty much every celebrity on TV or in magazines is seriously underweight, so it creates an unrealistic expectation and a lot of pressure. <br>  <br>  When my daughter brought this topic up up I was tempted at first to say "Oh honey, you're fine, don't worry about it" but I thought it was worth going into a little more deeply. I was the same size as she is when I was 14, so genetics plays a part, but I did decide at that point to stop overeating (which I tended to do out of laziness, bordeom and looking for a treat when things weren't going too well) and move around more, because I really did want to grow upwards but not outwards. It was a good decision, as I stayed fairly "normal-sized" while two of my sisters gained a lot of weight, which they found hard to lose later, and a third became anorexic. <br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to find the balance at this stage in your growth, so if you have any concerns (though you do look fine and not as though you need to worry) you can take a look at your activity levels and eating patterns and make adjustments gradually; it's better than getting into a yo-yo pattern of overeating and starving (which is quite common) and will keep you nice and healthy. |`|aXtV5YdFaa	NO!

After that, find a good editor, someone honest enough to be straight with you and to help you fix your document and format it for submission. I use www.wordtechs.com and have been very happy with them. Next you can either locate an agent or write your own query letters, and follow the publishers' submission guidelines, send off your manuscript and wait to connect with the right person.

Don't listen to the naysayers who poo-poo private publishing without checking it out. I know a successful writer in NYC who's pubbed 9 books and his next book he's going private - on his own. Why? "Because you can make more money."    He has an apartment right on Central Park as well as a home on Long Island...it's not hard to believe him.    Like I said, study them both. Read about how long it takes with both, how much money it takes ( with both ), your odds ( with both ). Weigh your options then choose.

Suggested Reading:  Plato (Phaedo or Phaedrus);   Aristotle's On the Soul,   the Confessions of St. Augustine, Aquinas (S. Th. Ia qq 75-89), Descartes (Meditations or Discourse on Method),   and modern thinkers such as Kant, Nietzsche, and Heidegger|`|e465e2e4034e896cb3f1af0dad54aca1aa	Philosophy is a field of study that includes diverse subfields such as aesthetics, epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics, in which people ask questions such as whether God exists, what is the nature of reality, whether knowledge is possible, and what makes actions right or wrong. The fundamental method of philosophy is the use of reasoning to evaluate arguments concerning these questions. However, the exact scope and methodology of philosophy is not rigid. What counts as philosophy is itself debated, and it varies across philosophical traditions.    The term philosophy comes from the Greek word "?" (philo-sophia), which means "love of wisdom" or less commonly "friend of wisdom". Many ancient Greek philosophers made the distinction between the desire for wisdom, as opposed to the desire for material things, vices, and the satisfaction of bodily desires. The definition of wisdom for many ancient Greeks would have been about virtue and the desire for knowledge and not false opinions. However, the term is notoriously difficult to define today (see definition of philosophy) because of the diverse range of ideas that have been labeled as philosophy. The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy defines it as the study of "the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action, and reality". The Penguin Encyclopedia says that philosophy differs from science in that philosophy's questions cannot be answered empirically, and from religion in that philosophy allows no place for faith or revelation. However, these points are called into question by the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, which states: "the late 20th-century... prefers to see philosophical reflection as continuous with the best practice of any field of intellectual enquiry." Indeed, many of the speculations of early philosophers in the field of natural philosophy eventually formed the basis for modern scientific explanations on a variety of subjects.    Informally, a "philosophy" may refer to a general world view or to a specific ethic or belief. However, this notion of "a" philosophy implies that there can be more than one answer to any of the major questions that philosophers have historically desired to answer. Many past philosophers would have claimed that there is only the attempt to study one philosophy, not the improper study of many philosophies, just as there is only one proper study on the subject of chemistry or physics.|`|49603573016e1c385baad2decba0c33baa	the discussion of ideas|`|bafba0d7944b755f0f32244881386872aa	You want a descrption of three words?

El autor  Isaacs escribi y public su novela entre 1864 y 1866, tenia entonces entre 27 y 29 a?os de edad. A partir de ese momento fue famoso; viaj por el Magdalena y la Guajira en expediciones cientficas; en poltica pas del conservatismo al liberalismo, fue cnsul en Chile entre 1870 y 1873 y protagoniz una efmera revuelta en el Estado de Antioquia en 1880. Ejerci el periodismo y escribi, adems de esta novela, cerca de doscientos poemas, tres dramas histricos, algunos trabajos de carcter cientfico y fragmentos de una novela histrica (Camilo) sobre la gesta emancipadora y la disolucin de la Gran Colombia. Pero tuvo poco xito en la vida poltica y en sus empresas particulares, y a los 58 a?os muri en Ibagu de fiebres paldicas, desenga?ado, pobre - nunca recibi dinero por sus derechos de autor, a pesar de que durante su vida se imprimieron ms de 25 ediciones de su novela en distintos pases del continente -, en una casa que le proporcion su colega escritor Juan de Dios Restrepo (ms conocido como Emiro Kastos).    Mara, que versa sobre la vida paradisiaco en el Valle del Cauca durante la primera mitad del siglo XIX, fue escrita en las orillas selvticas del ro Dagua, ?en el fondo del aquel ***** pas de las serpientes? como lo llamara Rafael Maya, cuando Isaacs desempe?aba un cargo menor en la construccin de un camino de Cali a Buenaventura. Para ese entonces, ya el joven Isaacs habla tomado contacto con la clase intelectual en Bogot y habla ledo sus poemas con cierto xito en la tertulia E lMosaico, ante figuras como Eugenio Daz, Vergara y Vergara, Diego Fallon, Prspero Pereira Gamba y Ricardo Silva. Cuando apareci Mara, su xito fue inmediato.    El argumento  El argumento de la obra es bien conocido. Narra los amores de Efran y Mara que tienen Iugar en la hacienda El Paraso, cercana a la ciudad de Cali. Salomn, el padre de Mara, viva en Jamaica; era judo y habla quedado viudo. Como Quera partir para la India por asuntos de negocios, decidi dejar a su hija de pocos a?os al cuidado de su primo, quien, bien establecido en el Valle del Cauca, era propietario de la rica hacienda El Paraso. La ni?a se llamaba Ester y su nuevo protector la bautiz por el rito catlico con el nombre de Mara. En El Paraso aprendi el espa?ol y creci al lado de Efran y sus hermanos Emma, Felipe, Eloisa y Juan. Emma, de aproximadamente la misma edad de Mara, cumplir un papel importante como mediadora y confidente de los novios. Juan, de slo tres a?os de edad al promediar el relato, tiene tambin papel protagnico: es objeto de las expresiones de cari?o, de los besos y caricias que Mara no puede otorgar pblicamente a Efran. Siendo ste adolescente, el padre decide enviarlo a estudiar a un colegio de Bogot. Al salir, Efran ve a su prima en la ventana rodeada de flores y desde ese momento sabe que la ama. Seis a?os despus regresa y encuentra tanto a Mara como a su hermana Emma convertidas en mujeres hermosas. Leen novelas de moda, en especial Atala, y se emocionan ante escenas como aqulla en la que Chactas, sobre el sepulcro de su amada, exclama: ?duerme en paz en extranjera tierra, joven desventuradas, frase que prefigura el destino de Mara. Abundan las miradas, las lgrimas y las flores, tres elementos de singular importancia, pues son ellos los signos privilegiados para expresar los sentimientos de los amantes, en un mundo jerarquizado por valores tradicionales y regido por el decoro. En slo cinco prrafos del primer captulo se llora seis veces. El amante se atormenta: ??Me quiere como yo a ella o se trata slo de un cari?o de hermana??. Por lo dems, la vida es apacible y la felicidad parece total. Efran sale en excursiones de cacera por los bosques, de pesquera por las orillas del ro Zabaletas o a visitar a los vecinos. Las caceras del tigre y del venado se narran con detalle. En la primea Efran termina como el hroe de la haza?a. La segunda tiene un final tierno, pues el venadito llega huyendo hasta la casa de la hacienda para ser protegido por Emma y Mara.    Cerca de la hacienda est la ?casita? de un colono antioque?o, Jos, quien vive all con su esposa Luisa y sus hijas Luca Y Trnsito. Efran los vista con frecuencia Y la novela narra con detalle su vida. Quedan descritos como Laboriosos y aseados? y sus hijas corno ?virtuosas?. De Jos se dice que ?su faz tena algo de bblico? (p.31). Ms adelante se cuentan los amores de Trnsito con un muchacho campesino, Braulio, y su posterior matrimonio. Se narran adems, de manera marginal, otros amores para abarcar as las castas sociales de campesinos, bogas, peones y esclavos, todo lo cual acta como contrapunto o complemento de la trama central.    Otro personaje importante en estos captulos intermedios es Carlos, hijo de un propietario rico de la regin. Estudi con Efrain en Bogot y con l tiene gran amistad. Su presencia en la novela comporta una necesidad estructural: pretende a Mara, le declara su amor y acude con su padre para pedirla en matrimonio. Mara se ve obligada a definir y expresar, ya de manera definitiva, sus sentimientos por Efran.    Los planes de matrimonio se ven entorpecidos, sin embargo, porque el padre ha decidido enviar a su hijo a estudiar medicina en Londres. Ha fijado un plazo de cuatro meses para el viaje, que se efectuar en compa?a del se?or de A... El matrimonio se realizar al regreso, cuando termine su carrera. Efran acepta la decisin de su padre, aunque habra preferido trabajar en la hacienda. Se desencadenan, entonces, otros hechos que alteran el sosi

Their site is a little tricky to navigate, but I'll give you a link straight to it.    A lot of their images, perhaps most, are available to download.  SOme are not due to copyrights or wishes of the contributor.  Some are print that hasn't been digitized yet.  But still, a huge source.    You might could also try stock xchange, but it would be a long shot.  Do you perhaps live in the area?  You can put a mention in the local paper.  Folks are always willing to help.    Hope this helps.

DvToP5h7aa	Cooper's depiction of American Indians was sometimes criticised as unrealistic and implausible. Over fifty years after The Deerslayer (1841) was published Mark Twain served up a heaping plate of sardonic but scathing criticism of it and Cooper in his essay "Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offences" (1895). But as Cooper writes in his Introduction to The Last of the Mohicans; more    http://www.online-literature.com/cooperj...    http://cooper.classicauthors.net/index.h...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fenim...

As a little girl, I remember her sitting down with me and asking me to go through her jewelery box. She asked me to choose something that I liked.  I was drawn to a ring, that in comparison to all of her other jewels, was well worn and a little dirty.  When I chose that as the one I liked best, I remember her embracing me and kissing me with her wet nana kisses that I always wiped away, and telling me that she was happy that was what I picked.  It ended up being her engagement ring...  I had that ring restored and cleaned back to its beauty when it was handed down to me when she passed, and remembering that moment with her as a young child, and the genuine happiness that came with it, makes that my most treasured and prized possession.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	CD's, Computer, Books.|`|fZEGTGP7aa	My ears..It wouldn't do any good to say my extensive music collection with thousands of LP's 45's and CD's..if I couldn't hear them!|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	the people in my life, not that i posses them, but i'd take them over anything material any day|`|70jNDiIiaa	My most treasured material possession is my veritable mountain of journals and writer's notebooks, which I've been accumulating since I was a kid.

But it becomes bad, when a knowledge which should be used for positivie purposes are used for negative actions.    For instance, the invention of nuclear bomb was supposed to help the mankind. The humans were supposed to benefit from it by using the nuclear energy, but we used it for negative purposes. We used it to build bombs and take lives.

Secondo Pausania, originariamente erano tre e avevano nome di Melete ("Esercizio"), Mneme ("Memoria") e Aoide ("Canto"): nella poesia orale, gli aedi necessitavano di esercizio e di memoria per rammentare o comporre i loro canti.   Secondo altri erano sette, denominate "le Muse di Lesbo". Nell'"Iliade" si parla di una Musa, oppure, genericamente, di Muse, senza specificarne il numero. Nell'"Odissea" la Musa  una sola, ma nel XXIV canto diventano nove.

P4sd5oCBaa	Flowers see beauty and their own fragrant goodness in all and tend to overlook or be blind to the flaws and faults of weeds.    Weeds in seeking to shed their weed status and acquire bloom and beauty, are able to spot a flower and destroy, corrupt or procur the flower in their midst quite readily.    Weeds spot a flower, flowers are usually oblivious. That is the beauty of flowers and the reason for their decline and demise.  |`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	as a weed is only a flower in the wrong place how could you choose.  enjoy the day|`|AA11510511	MY motto is:-    If its green, it is a weed.

The first doubt will come to every person what is the standard for judging greatest achievement. In a competitive world, one supersedes the other.

What you might consider Evil I may not. I think it all depends on the perspective of others. I mean people living during the time of Hitler in Germany didn't think he was evil. If they did they would have refused to go along with his crazy ideas. I think people learn certain traits as they get older and that influences them as they age.

LZKzV6zIaa	OK.  This one is easy dude.  So, basic tab looks something like:  ---------------------------  ----1---------------------  ----------2----0---------  ---------------------3----  ---------------------------  --------------------------    Now, each line is a string, with the first line being the first string (highest) and the last line being the sixth string (lowest).  Each of the numbers are frets, the 1 being the first fret,  (the closest to the head), 2 being the second fret, and so on and so on.  Their are other symbols such as / or \ for slide up or slide down, respectively.  H is for hammer-on and P is for pull off.  * usually stands for harmonics, which is a whole different matter.  There are many, many more symbols, but you can just look those up on the internet when you come across a new one.  Now, a common problem with tablature as opposed to standard notation is that you can't tell how many counts to hold a note for.  You'll have to listen to the song for the rhythm.  I think this is a good answer.  The question was oddly worded so I just did a lesson in Tablature.  Also, you can get free tablature from either ultimate-guitar.com or 911tabs.com.   Oh, as a closing note, tablature generally takes the place fo chords for finger pickin' songs. hope this helps!|`|1SnI86BIaa	tabs are easy    numbers are the frets taht you hold down    then strum..|`|zahy4Brqaa	Go to Youtube and type waltribeiro guitar. you ll get a very nice collection from Walt that covers almost all types of guitar playing techniques.|`|kmTnIuL2aa	each line is a string, with the bottom line as the lowest string. Each number represents which fret to play. Other symbols are usually explained in the tab.|`|60xKMmsvaa	If you could pot a link as an example of what they looked liked maybe I could explain    Theres only one type I can understand =/|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	Okay in tabs each line represents a string, each number represents a fret on said string, for example, well first off the first line is the first string, the first string is also the highest string, contrary to what you may think since the lowest string is the closest one to you when you play. For example this tab:    ----0-----------  ----------------  -------0--------  -----------------  -----------0----  ----------------    It means play the first string open, then the thirs string open, then the fifth string open, easy, now if two numbers are over one another it means play them both at the same time, figure out how. A thing like this 6/7 means play the 6 fret the slide your finger to the seventh. 6h7 means hammer on the seventh after playing the 6th, so in other words play the sixth fret then place you finger down onto the seventh one to play it, do not slide your finger when you see this. 7P6 means the same thing but instead of putting it on you pull a finger off. Play the 7th pull off to play the 6th.    Now another kind of music would be the Five line staff, which notes on it, the notes look like circles with tales, and some are just circles. This music has been used for a long time, still used today, much better than tabs, but also harder to understand.    Five lines  G  F---------------------------  E  D---------------------------  C  B---------------------------  A  G----------------------------  F  E----------------------------  D    Each represents a different note,  In descending order it is (from the space above the top line. Now understand your guitar.... each string on the guitar plays a standard note when tuned (properly). These notes are, in descending order from the first string.    E  B  G  D  A  E    Now with this you can find any other note on any other string, though it's a little complicated. There is a formula. Each fret represents either a whole step or a half step, now a whole step means the length it takes for a note to change an entire LETTER pitch, this would mean to get from a B to a C    A half step means the legth to get half a pitch meaning For a D to a E it means it's not exactly a D but it's not high enough to be an E it's inbetween a D and an E, so we use a   to represent this, in other words a D . This means it's slightly higher than a D but not high enough to become an E. Likewise you can also write it out as an Eb the b means flat, the   means sharp. Get it? Sharper means higher, Flat means... lower, lol. So now the notes go in order like this,    A-A -B-C-C -D-D -E-F-F -G-G -A-A -B-C- so on so forth.    Now you may have noticed there is no half step between a B-C and an E-F, well that's something I don't understand either but there is no half step between them, BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND a B-C is NOT A WHOLE STEP it is a HALF STEP. Just like an A-A  is a half step a  B-C is also a half step. In order for a not to be a whole step you must go past two notes (including sharps) now this does not means you go past a sharp and a flat since flats and sharps are the same. You can also write the above line like this with flats    A-Bb-B-C-Db-D-Eb-E-F-Gb-G-Ab-A-Bb-B    I personally think flats are harder to understand than sharps but that because I've always pretty much used sharp.    I hope this helps. Oh an remember each fret is a half step on the guitar, so I'll write out a few frets in the First string to show you the notes. The note in Parenthesis means it's an open string ( ) I also placed numbers above the notes to represent the frets so for example the 10TH FRET plays a D and the 11th fret plays a D          1  2   3  4   5  6   7 8  9  10 11  (E)-F-F -G-G -A-A -B-C-C -D-D     Now I'm not entirely sure about this and you should look up more about notes and the guitar to understand it better in case I made a mistake but this is the basics of music reading in either TAB or Classical.    ALSO NOTE ---- Classical Music Notation can also show the rthym and beat of music which tabs cannot easily do. If you ever see letters written above tabs these refer to the beats or Whole note, Half note, Quarter note, Eighth note, etc....    Let me explain the rthyms. Have you ever heard someone count of 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4,? Well that's pretty much it, they cout off the speed of the song. But normally it's 1& 2& 3& 4&.  If you were talkig you would say, "One and, two and, three and, four and,"    Each "1 and", is a beat. The above numbers would represent 4/4 time since there are four beats....... get it?  So now a whole note would mean you get four beats since it's the whole beat. A half note is only half and would only get "1 and two and"  a quarter note only gets 1/4 beats or 1 beat out of four or just "1 and"  and an eighth note only gets 1/8 or it gets split up, half of a quarter beat or "1" or just "and"    Now a sixteenth note gets 1/16 beat.... but of course we don't have sisxteen easily countable beats since if we add up "1 and two and three and four and" you see there's only four wor

HWSMljLoaa	a logical possibility is an outcome without trial, an estimation of an event's outcome. for instance... say you have a spherical object, you throw it off a cliff, it lands on the ground below. you test this over again, several times, all with the same outcome. so it's logical to assume, that if you throw the sphere off the cliff again, it will end up falling on the ground. but when you go to throw it off the cliff again, you discover that a gust of wind has suddenly stopped the object from plummeting to the base of the cliff, but instead, has hurled it up into the air, and back toward you, to have it land behind where you stand. my point is, a logical possibility is not necessarily what WILL happen, it's what you think will happen, based on passed experience.  hope i helped.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	logical possibility is more hypothesis rather than physical is based on physical proof.|`|42223372622a38f2018e30c03299ab0eaa	There isn't any.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	http://www.southwestern.edu/pipermail/su...

AA10704364	There needs to be more info in order to answer your question.  Who are the biographies about?   Is there a book that is giving these references?    More info needed.
SPQdFOwKaa	One of the basic keywords that covers the entire narration is "hopelessness." Since the setting is during the Great Depression of the 1930's, hopelessness is what characterized the entire era. That was also connected with the economic hardship and the automation of the industrial productions. The characters driven by despair, they search the land they live in for their lost dignity, youth, happiness. Also, the main character of the book, Ma Joad, attempts in agony to sustain the family together. But other then her, most of the other characters are in deep depression, self-questioning and resignation. Jim Casy -an otherwise holy man- because he fornicated with several church members on several occasions; Uncle John because he ignored his wife to take her to the doctor and she died; Pa Joad because he sees all his endeavors falling apart. But the book is also filled with hope, that in the end all will work out, a need for a getaway and freedom.

RzbRRUOdaa	Presuming that you have already finished your story, you can start looking for an agent.  If you don't want to go through the traditional process, you can self-publish.    Check this link below for the self-publishing process:  http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...|`|R0iHHPqEaa	go online look up publishing companies and send you're book to the address idk|`|gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your story.    Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit http://www.writersdigest.com to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.    There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.    At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit http://www.agentquery.com). Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.    If you decide to self-publish, then you will pay (potentially up to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on which publisher you choose).     Good luck!
ff22424db146598e624f4622ed89284caa	This is a straightforward cash collection fundraising at local merchants. Here's what you do. Save old coffee cans and cover them in bright color paper with your organization's name and logo prominently displayed. A catchy slogan never hurts. Visit all local merchants and ask if you can leave a can at their cash register.  Don't forget to visit all participating local merchants once a week and collect all proceeds. Your organization gets 100% of the profit.           Specify on the can where fundraising donations will specifically go.  Example: "to purchase school supplies for under privileged children".  This helps those donating feel like they can associate their donation with an ongoing program, and if it happens to be one that warms their heart, they'll be more likely to give!    There are several commercial companies who sell fundraising donation containers in different materials and styles. They look "nicer" but reduce your profits.  However, the printed labels can help 'legitimize' your drive.  People tend to believe printed labels mean what they say.  Homemade Lollipops Fundraising  Make homemade suckers and sell them for your next fundraising event.  With a relatively small investment in ingredients, combined with a little teamwork and fun in the kitchen you can make and sell hundreds of handmade lollipops. The cost of materials for making 300 lollipops (including sugar, corn syrup, molds, flavoring, food coloring, sticks, sucker bags and twist ties) will be about $40.  Sell them for $.75 each and your profit will be $185.          Lollipop Recipe:    1 3/4 cups granulated sugar  1 1/2 cups light corn syrup  1 cup water  2 teaspoons candy flavoring oil, any flavor  1/4 teaspoon liquid food coloring (any color)    lollipop molds - any shape  lollipop sticks  sucker bags  twist ties    Prepare molds by lightly spraying with non-stick cooking spray and inserting sucker sticks.  In a large saucepan, mix together sugar, corn syrup and water.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring mixture to a boil without stirring.  When syrup temperature reaches 260 degrees F., add color.  Do not stir; boiling action will incorporate color into syrup. Remove from heat at 300 degrees F. or when drops of syrup from hard, brittle threads in cold water.  After boiling action ceases, add flavoring oil and stir.  Pour syrup into lightly oiled lollipop molds and allow to cool at room temperature (do not refrigerate) .  Remove from molds and wrap in individual plastic sucker bags and tie with a twist tie.  Depending on mold size, this recipe will make about 30 - 40 suckers.  also a ca wash is always good hope i helped|`|3daa3cff7b080b2d37bfeb4359996134aa	That sucks sorry for your lose. I would say get your friends together and have them bring nice things that you could have a silent auction between your friends for the items. ( Maybe if everyone was cool with it, have the parents keep the items and the money.)|`|AA10704364	Sorry for this horrible loss.

Have you, or someone close to you, experienced them?    If not, then I would suggest doing some research to keep from being a "generic" drug addict story.    Up until I got to the last sentence, I thought it was another one of those "I am morphing into a vampire" stories.  Sorry, maybe it's just the influx of those types of stories here on YA.

4025a3c70cf6be94cf57472ae130d67caa	Fairy Talse are Myths.  Myths are Legends.  Legends have basis in fact.    Therefore Fairy tales have a basis in fact. However you must be careful not to take everything in them too literally. It was common practise to use literary cheats, for example great physical beauty to protrey emotional qualities like kindness and goodness.    Read between the lines, the main charaters fall in love because of the 'beautiful soul' and not the looks. Many have cautionary tales also, like beauty and the beast. The beast is a prince placed under a curse (read jean-marie laprince de beaumont's version avaliable of the net) and turned to a monster. It is only through beauty's love that it is broken. This tale is warning of the danger of looking only for the best looking, for it is sometimes the beast who has the kindest heart of all.    Be warned. Many see fairy tales as just nonsense. They don't (or in some cases can't) understand that fairy tales are tales of humanity and what it is to be human wrapped in a easy to swallow coating.    IN SHORT, yes they can happen in real life but be warned they do not happen quite the same way as they are written.    Hope this helps.|`|6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	Fairytales in the olden times were more than just fanciful stories, many had moral and political messages, but they used imaginative and engaging themes to entertain while teaching (kind of like fables).

DvToP5h7aa	The Crucible - Arthur Miller    Act One    ? The scene opens in Reverend Parriss house, in a small upstairs bedroom, in the year 1692. The narrator describes Reverend Parris as a suspicious man in his mid-forties, one who often imagines that the world is against him. The narrator describes Salem as a new town with a strict Puritan way of life, and its outlook on the rest of the world one of parochial snobbery  in other words, small-town small-mindedness. The town saw itself as persecuted, a legacy from persecution of Puritans in the Old World (Europe). Because the Puritans sought a community, they managed to survive. But by 1692, much that was good about the Puritans, the narrator suggests, has been lost to history. The Salem witch-trials were an opportunity for neighbors to vent against neighbors, to publicly air long-standing jealousy, to accuse those they disliked. And all while sounding righteous and religious!      FULL SUMMARY of Act 1.  http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/a...|`|RKgNrOULaa	Haha, Im not doing your homework for you!!!
AA10031363	It's very idealized. There are no problems with their life. The sun always shines, the flowers always bloom. But that's not how love actually would be. Christopher Marlowe, though, seems to be quite the romantic. He paints love as a powerful force that would overcome any obstacles, would make the sun shine, and would never fade. Basically, he paints it very unrealistically.    As an extra bonus, here is a fabulous poem written by Sir Walter Raleigh in response to this one. If you have time, give it a read- it's my favorite poem of all time.    The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd    If all the world and love were young,  And truth in every shepherd's tongue,  Those pretty pleasures might me move  To come with you and be your love.    Time drives the flock from field to fold,  When rivers rage and rocks grow cold,  And Philomel becometh dumb,  The rest complains of cares to come.    The flowers do fade, and wanton fields  To wayward winter reckoning yields;  A honey tongue, a heart of gall,  Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall.    Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses,  Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies  Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten  In folly ripe, in season rotten.    Thy belt of straw and ivy buds,  Thy coral clasps and amber studs,  All these in me no means can move  To come to thee and be thy love.    But could youth last and love still breed,  Had joys no date nor age no need,  Then these delights my mind might move  To live with thee and be thy love.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Summary and Analysis of The Passionate Shepherd to His Love    by Christopher Marlowe    http://www.gradesaver.com/christopher-ma...

Investigate the proofs, reliable testimonies, and purposes of each religion. Look at science if you have to. I believe that as you get more into science that religion takes a bigger role. Science and religion both claim that something created the world, whether it be the big bang or a deity. But what started the big bang? what created the deity? You have to decide for yourself. Is it about me, or is there something more to life than myself. Pride is a big issue in this. After a while, pride doesn't make you feel so good anymore.     There's always going to be problems.

88304803220e5b14c77c3c8b225a6921aa	It's true that the grammar sounds incorrect to my American ears.  There are better ways to write the sentence, the best of which being as follows:  "He and I are going to school."    However, I'm unsure that your sense is actually wrong in the strictest sense.  You have a subject, "I," and a verb, "am going," which agrees with it.  "As well as" is a copulative conjunction that has the unusual property of not affecting the verb, and "he" seems to be in the correct case (nominative).  "To school" is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb.  It all seems perfectly fine in the abstract.    I think the reason that it sounds weird to me is that "as well as" is a little bit ambiguous in everyday usage -- is it a conjunction or a prepositional phrase?|`|976aa08aea43900b0d8216b1ef132c4baa	I would write it, "I, as well as he, am going to school".|`|2afac27ff6915d8a77afda56d76bfb01aa	him and i are going to school.  he and i are going  i am going with him  he is going with me  we are going to the school|`|488823611b3dd130eb3a102a9da58b4caa	its a messy sentence and hard to get the meaning of -- "i am going to school as well as he is" would be clearer.  even clearer would be "he and i are going to school".  the subject is i and not he so the verb would be am -- sticking the phrase "as well as he" in between the subject and verb doesn't change them from being the subject and verb.|`|AA10979513	I would say... we are both going to school...|`|AA10704364	Try "Both he and I are going to school".

My highest level of mental peace comes from knowing my Christmas shopping is done.|`|58a620ddca36368d3ecc8ccd1268241baa	My level of mental peace has come from my 80 years of living and adjusting,  accepting that the world and all its people are not going to alter their views and actions to satisfy the needs of  my comfort  level.   But, in identifying an environment or attitude that disturbs my peace of mind, that I do not want as part of my life,  I can, and I have made the inner, mental adjustments in  my own attitude that allowed me to refuse access to some of the external negatives around me.  Shutting out the causes of unease, either mentally or by physically removing self to another place,  strengthens the self confidence that monitors what will be given space in the environment of our lives.   Within the limitations of our abilities if we can find and enhance our focus on our natural  talents and interests, the  resulting achievements will provide the greatest comfort, satisfaction and enjoyment in the moment and in life.  Awareness of having reached that level delivers the  inate sense of wellbeing and peace that tells you all is right with your world.   A simple approach to that point may be the Serenity Prayer that asks God to give us the strength to change what can be changed, to accept what cannot be changed,  and begs the wisdom to know the difference between the two.      ..

This should be two sentences.  For instance "...admit no more.   She directed the porter to invite to dinner all who came ,,,"  This also takes care of the passive voice problem "the porter was told".       The countess wished to have a tete-a-tete talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikhaylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg.     Again a long sentence.  "The countess invited her childhood friend, Princess Anna Mikhaylovna, to her suite for a tete-a-tete.  They had not conversed since she returned from Petersburg."  (The countess or the princess?)    In the context here, I can't tell why Anna Mikhaylovna's face is fear-worn.  It would probably be obvious if I'd read the whole story.      I haven't read a lot of Russian novels, so maybe the qutoation by Anna M.  is very appropriate.  I'd rather read, though,  "To be honest with you, I don't have many old friends left.

SONG.  by John Donne      GO and catch a falling star,  Get with child a mandrake root,  Tell me where all past years are,  Or who cleft the devil's foot,  Teach me to hear mermaids singing,  Or to keep off envy's stinging,              And find              What wind  Serves to advance an honest mind.     If thou be'st born to strange sights,  Things invisible to see,  Ride ten thousand days and nights,  Till age snow white hairs on thee,  Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,  All strange wonders that befell thee,              And swear,              No where  Lives a woman true and fair.     If thou find'st one, let me know,  Such a pilgrimage were sweet;  Yet do not, I would not go,  Though at next door we might meet,  Though she were true, when you met her,  And last, till you write your letter,              Yet she              Will be  False, ere I come, to two, or three.

These things change very quickly. Some publishers--HarperTeen has a program where people can sign up for a chance to win books...I think there are four or five every month...you just have to send them your review. But if you love to read, you might like the chance to review and let your opinion be known.     ARCs are typically for booksellers, reviewers, librarians, and possibly teachers. They are a chance to let them know what is available and let them see if they want to order the book when it is released. They were not designed to take the place of the final product. HOWEVER it is wrong--and I can't stress this enough--very wrong to sell or buy ARCs. They state very clearly that they are not to be sold in any way shape or form. They are not meant to be sold to the public on ebay or Amazon or any other used retailer.|`|AA12064058	Sure!  I've gotten tons of ARCs from ebay and half.com.

Summer Sun       GREAT is the sun, and wide he goes     Through empty heaven without repose;     And in the blue and glowing days     More thick than rain he showers his rays.          Though closer still the blinds we pull          5   To keep the shady parlour cool,     Yet he will find a chink or two     To slip his golden fingers through.          The dusty attic, spider-clad,     He, through the keyhole, maketh glad;   10   And through the broken edge of tiles     Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.          Meantime his golden face around     He bares to all the garden ground,     And sheds a warm and glittering look   15   Among the ivy's inmost nook.          Above the hills, along the blue,     Round the bright air with footing true,     To please the child, to paint the rose,     The gardener of the World, he goes.   20|`|AA10704364	Just the first stanza of The Walrus and the Carpenter - by Lewis Carroll.
3811cf2118d0cdbb069be777cffa6108aa	Trumpeters, or buglers, were important elements of the Army throughout the 19th century. In the cavalry, buglers were given gray horses. This was the traditional color for musicians. Buglers had to be a superb horseman. In order to keep the hands free while playing, the bugler controlled the horse with his knees. It was a difficult enough task for the bugler to perform while the horse was standing still or at a walk. This problem was only compounded when playing at the charge.  In the field, one bugler reported to the regimental commander as orderly bugler of the day. Once a command or signal was given on the march, the bugler played the appropriate call for that command or signal. After a pause, he repeated the last note. The original call that was sounded became the preparatory command. The repeated last note became the signal of execution. In addition, a call which ascended the musical scale indicated movement to the right of the line or column while a call which descended the scale indicated movement to the left of the line or column.  An additional duty of the orderly bugler of the day was messenger for the regimental commander. Trumpeter John Martin was the orderly bugler of the day at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. His life was spared when sent back with a message from Custer's Adjutant to Colonel Benteen requesting the ammunition packs brought forward. In 1879, Martin was called to Chicago to give testimony at the court of inquiry investigating the events at the Little Big Horn.  The musical and non-musical requirements of field musicians often put them on the front lines and exposed to fire. Some even earned the Medal of Honor for their individual actions. For example, Trumpeter John E. Clancy, Light Battery E, First Artillery, received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Wounded Knee Creek, December 29, 1890.|`|152ebaf728d43415bf50788064a535daaa	Almost all positions are more prestigious than soldier.But someone has to do it.|`|AA10419438	A trumpeter would probably be a better postition- you don't have to fight and you still get the same things, but they probably were at risk as well, and vulnerable to starvation.

Then a guy sitting ( you were standing next to him) jumped up and walked behind the teenager.   You noticed something that caught your eyes. He slipped his hand fast into teenager's pocket, by the chance of the crowd were hustling in and out the bus. Out of the bus, he walked away from the teenager, empty handed and acted like nothing happened. The bus was slowly moving.  To be assure, you got down quickly from the bus as well to catch up with the teenager. You told him the what you saw. He was surprised. But both of you did not shout for the guy. The next thing you realised was that the bus had left. Teenager thanked you. However, the appreciation did not bother you anymore.  You missed the last train.

But it's up to you. Ply what you want, what you like, not what the world needs more off, lol. I like the sound of a guitar, so I chose a guitar, I hate the sound of drums and I probably never will learn them.

Cooney  Sunday at Tiffany's -James Patterson|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  This is an extremely good book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too.

ITS A TRUE STORY! :]    Its about a guy that graduates collage, cuts up his credit cars gives all his money ($24000) to charity and goes of on a 2 year adventure across North america. When his car is destroyed by a flash flood he burns the rest of his money and Hitchhikes and walks across america.    Along the way he meets people who he made a huge impression on considering he only met them for a wile.    He gets jobs every now and then to be able to afford money.  At the End, he goes on his Great Alaskin Adventure! Which is the thing he was planing for a wile.  During which he eats something he should 100 days though and quickly starves to death. He died in a abandoned bus that he stayed in for over 100 days without seeing anybody. He was literally trapped in the wild.  The book has many great quotes and lessons.  The sad thing was, he wanted to turn back but he couldn't! a river he crossed had gotten much larger, and made it impossible to pass.  He realized just before he died, that "HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED" as he wrote in his diary shortly before he died.    Its the best book ive ever read, there is even a film that came out last year that follows the true story of what happened very well... here is the trailer  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=2LAuzT_x8E...    Here are a few pictures of the real person (Christopher Johnson McCandles) found undeveloped in his Camera  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=aQbrVl_2K2...    One of wich were he is waving with the peice of papaer and smiling, wich it says in the book, was his death letter saying "I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!" they think that picture was taken just befor he whent to sleep and died.  His body was found 2 weeks after by rare moos hunters.  I didnt ruin it for you by saying he died! As it says he died on the first page!  The book and the film are the best ever, even when i bough the book (wich has 205 pages) the guy at the counter said he watched the film the other night and cryed. :]  If it wasnt a good inspiring story, dozons of people wouldnt die trying to get to the abandoned buss in the middle of nowhere each year and i wouldnt have the bus as my avatar.

fle8hQrAaa	I know someone who just recently got a YAS-62 and was very very happy with it.  This is a sax that is a great move for a serious intermediate player to upgrade to (don't know what level you are at).  It can take you right up to pro playing (including college/university and pro gigs!!).  The Selmer Paris Altos are nice too but are generally more expensive (almost double the cost of the Yamahas).  Also, check out the Cannonball saxes.  Nice and not bad cost.  They make a silver one which looks really sharp!

810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	Er, yes...  Jacob finds his soulmate in the form of a new born baby.  Thats inappropriate no matter which way you spin it. Stephenie tried valiantly to make it appear sweet, but she failed, and it was still sick.    The birth scene is nothing less than horrific, considering its intended audience. Biting through flesh and gushing blood, bones cracking while a fetus rips through its mother's womb? Ew.|`|5lmC19GLaa	well if you understand the book then probs 13 over (closer to the end)    but its only a few pages of 'innapropriate' like the birth of renessme that was to graphical, if a young person was reading it then they probably would understand anyway.    btw, its a amazing book i think its the best in the series.|`|ITZRv0XGaa	no  age (13 and up)|`|TlqSAM0naa	hmm. i think a mature 12 yr old would be okay with reading it    it doesn't actually have any pg-13 scenes.    i understand the birth scene.. that was gross for me, but it's not like you actually see it|`|aitD50yuaa	13 and up, I have not read that yet, I do own all the books, I never knew there was a sex scene how it happen lol and are they detailed XD    But I need to read its.|`|km1vuLUzaa	highschool+|`|GnpVkVnnaa	nothing about it is bad. theres like 4 sex scenes, trust me you dont read about it. i might not even know that they are sex parts. like Bella says something, and you just get led on and u assume its a sex scene. i say its a age group book from 13+.    but its a stellar book! i love it|`|cvh6u58Daa	I don't think its that innapropriate, there are a few things that should not have been in the book.  Like jacob and reneesmee becoming s, thats gross.|`|mgrXBTrwaa	NO 13 AND UP   HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE I MEAN THEY ARE MARRIED BE FORE THER IS ANY SEX|`|d8b6703f3fe553c8173f1543b80dcc85aa	I have a stepsister in 6th grade and im in 9th but, her mom won't let her read it because it's "inaptopriate" but here's what i think.    I really think that the saga has a good messages because technically, edward and bella abstained, didn't they?  and in breaking dawn they do do it a couple times but honestly, it really doesn't matter because they were already married. so i think that if if you immature then don't read it. so no exact age can read the book because everyone matures at different rates and i read twilight when i was in seventh grade... so really it comes down to if you're mature or not.|`|6OUUlyaiaa	I don't really think it's that bad but a 12+ book. Personally, I loved it!!
JZVGeRFqaa	i like it|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Be careful of being repetitive.  "Finding me/find me", "kill me/kill you/kill myself", "power thirst/my powers/special power".    The dialogue sounds a bit juvenile, like it was written by someone 10 -12 years old.    Break up the story into readable paragraphs.  One idea, one paragraph.    You also have some typos you need to edit.|`|SygvUa0Eaa	It doesn't seem interesting enough. "He used his special power to hurt me." See, this would be good for kids about 10 and under. But if you're aiming for an age more advanced, this one sentence would lead them away from the book. You should word it more like,:    A burning sensation consumed my fragile body. I fell to the ground and curled up like a dead spider, engulfed with searing pain and agony. I knew this was the work of Tyler; he was too strong...    This is more descriptive, and less boring. The sentence you used before was short, and kind of dull (no offense).     Also, it was a little bit cliche in the sense that this scenario is overused. She's running, and the person chasing her threats someone else, and she acts all brave, yadda yadda. It's just... Overused. Good start though, keep going.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	It's good, but I don't know what's this all about, I mean, I understand the scene, but not its reason to be.

8asG4WCwaa	it's not a problem.  many authors living in other countries have american or british agents and publishers.  query agents interested in fantasy genre (don't say fantasy fiction novel, all novels are fiction).|`|RzbRRUOdaa	Since you can't find an agent in the Caribbean, I suggest that you self-publish your book.  Transactions are faster because most of them are done online.  All you need to have is an internet connection.    Most of the publishing companies are in the US and mostly, they only cater to writers/authors in the US and Canada.  However, if you know anybody, a friend or colleague, who lives in either the US or Canada, you may ask him or her to receive for you this FREE book publishing guide from Xlibris, a self-publishing company:  http://www.xlibris.com/requestkit/index....

I hope you will find this useful and helpful.|`|SygvUa0Eaa	It's not a matter of how difficult it is to get a book published overseas- it's how much it costs. Nowadays, it's much easier to send things from place-to-place, i.e.: e-mail, air (planes), boats, etc. However, it's very expensive to have items transported from country to country. Talk to your agent about it. He/she would be able to explain it better, and you definitely need someone to help you along the way, because it's very difficult to have this stuff done by yourself.
VCIZJQCJaa	it depends on the category of book basically.she will have to do a query,checking what publishers might be interested in her book.go to the library or online and look for books similar to yours/hers,look at publishers and who the author's give credit too.you may want to find an agent.they know the angles if you are inexperienced,...you can do it yourself,but living with the mistakes is expensive.make sure you have the best title and book cover.the old saying you can't tell a book by it's cover-it's true.write a cover letter,this is difficult.you want to present yourself in the most confident manor,without sounding desperate or too aggressive.try small publishers too. you also have to think of marketing and promoting well in advance,and the book if it's about the south -by all means promote it there,if it's about city girls maybe a big city is the place to go..and finally the rejection letters.it happens to the best,just be prepared to get them over and over again.lastly,never ever give up,keep on writing,it will happen|`|DjCLWseZaa	I don't know, but I wish your friend luck.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	It sounds like this is the first time she's ever written a book.      For one thing, a book has more than one chapter.  Another thing is that just because she says it's good, doesn't mean it is.  She should get some beta readers to go over it.      She will also need to find a literary agent since publishers do not accept manuscripts from unknown writers.  Research and find one that specializes in the genre of her book and send them a query letter.    IF they are interested, they may contact her.    Don't hold your breath, though.  Chances are quite small that they will.

iNXqiDIYaa	the price is in Canadian Dollars but if you buy it from canadian amazon you will have higher shipping charges (always assuming that the canadian site will ship to the US!)    if you can and do go ahead the charge made by amazon will be in canadian dollars - your credit card company will then convert that to US dollars probably at a poorish rate and probably with a conversion charge (you will need to refer to your credit card contract to see exactly what charges)
UdwIaCxBaa	Never fear - Ol'Joker's here    Genre - Teen, Coming of age, historical  Style - Teen, mystery in parts  Tone - The tone of it is kind of mystery I guess because the two kids are unaware of the larger, more brutal picture...so there's also an impending tone throughout the book  Theme - Human connection, The strength of relationships, Coming of age    The boys are in the Nazi prison camp (one is a prisoner, the other is the son of a nazi) and they find a connection. Its a cool book and movie. I had to read it at school.|`|n7rfbfGmaa	Well its set in the second world war in Berlin, and its from a young boys point of view. Its very much written as a young boy would think, like he doesn't know completely what's going on all the time, and does things that he gets told off for but doesn't understand why. Errm....you should maybe just try and read it....its actually really good and you could be through it really quickly.

862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	You need an agent because most publishers won't look at your novel without one.    Agents are free. They get a cut of the profit if your book sells, but you NEVER pay them upfront.      And finish your book before you start worrying about any of that.|`|JZVGeRFqaa	there used to be some publishers where you didn't need agents but after alot of research i have found out that most publishers now require an agent.|`|L6Ko87r9aa	It's much more than "not getting screwed over." Many publishers won't look at manuscripts unless you have an agent for it. They have way too many things to do to spend their time looking through books that were randomly sent it. Without an agent, it's highly unlikely that anyone will look at your manuscript any longer than it takes to print out a rejection letter and send it back - maybe not even that. It's harsh, but that's the way it is. If you're serious about getting published, an agent is the way to go.

rMTq7yMyaa	www.writingforums.com|`|AjqO1aJgaa	www.critiquecircle.com - it won't cost you a penny, but it will cost you some time. You "pay" for your critiques by critiquing other people's stories.

It is someone pointing out every little error, flaw, lack of logic, plothole and bad characterisation in your story.|`|DAixT7Nuaa	Yeah I actually currently wrote a poem, and one of my  teachers critiqued it for me.

L6Ko87r9aa	You can be too young or too ignorant of some subjects to write about them, yes, but you're never too young to write.    As for finding an agent and a publisher, I'd do some research on your own after writing your book. Right now, don't worry about publishing. That's a long way off in the future, and I hate to say it, but realistically, it probably won't happen. Many amazing books never get published because publishers don't think they have the potential to sell. For now, just write it.    Best of luck! :)|`|ydPOlK3uaa	i wrote books when i was 11 or 12 years, but i never published it. i would wait till i grow up and edit it and maybe publish it if i get lucky.

AHuBqplbaa	I can relate because it was the same for me with writing.  I started a million things and stopped them and what I was doing was putting too much pressure on myself, trying so hard to come up with something great and replicate what I once did so well, that I came up with nothing at all.      The two things that helped most was the recognition that I've grown up and changed, my imagination was stale from neglect, and that must find my inner writer (or inner artist) all over again. That and simple persistence.  Don't give up no matter how many projects you start and trash, and think of yourself more as a beginner instead of trying to pick up where you left off.
