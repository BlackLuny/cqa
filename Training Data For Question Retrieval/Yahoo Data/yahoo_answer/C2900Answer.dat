kqa9VFrfaa	I used to raise angora rabbits and spin their wool. I have also carded wool from dogs. Here are the best breeds to do this with.  Samoyed  Standard Poodles  Old English Sheepdogs  Afghan Hounds  Hungarian Pulis  Collies  U can also use hair from a few other breeds such as chows or chow mixes. It depends on how long the actual hair length is, at the time of harvest. Go find a grooming shop or kennel that will let U go thru their trash or actually separate it out for U if U know what U want for colors.  Angora goat hair is beautiful, and I use it for crafts, but have never woven it. U can also braid leather from hides if U are into harvesting animals.   Flax is an old stand-by. Look it up online for growing and production. It is a bit tough to make soft enough to weave.   Can U grow mulberry trees? There are always silkworms? Haha.

When the worms pupate (do thier turning into moth thing) they weave a cocoon made of a single strand of silk. to make yarn, all you have to do is wind several of these silk strands togehter. By far the simplest yarn to make, no spinning involved. Although spinning is a lot of fun.

WeZcSZvKaa	The real question you have to ask yourself is really "What exactly is a Carbon Footprint?" Our last ice age which covered parts of the Northern Hemisphere was just only 10,000 years ago.     All this carbon rubbish is an unproved fact to screw as much money as they can out of the taxpayers.    There was some report in the UK a few weeks back about something and we have saved 5,000,000 tons of CO2 emissions. Well excuse me what exactly does 5,000,000 tons of CO2 emissions looks like. How can we relate it to something else? It is a totally meaningless figure!    Do you know what 5,000,000 tons looks like? I certainly don't.    Someone quoted a report that was made that the Polar ice caps were melting so fast that before long you would be able to sail between the top of the US and Russia as it would become an open seaway due to global warming. All doom and gloom!  But this happened to have been written in 1832. Long before internal combustion engines, power stations etc. About 75 years in fact.    So you have to ask yourself who is conning who?|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Not very much at all.|`|ZZOtscXsaa	NOT GOOD|`|fea43ac2956bf41fab5f1df268f71f15aa	Not as much as someone who drives 20 miles a day!

kqa9VFrfaa	R U seriously asking this question? We wasted it, that's what happened to it. Wasted. Did U ever look at one of those maps from satellite that shows electric light usage? It is appalling to see how much electricity we use up at night for no good reason. The vehicles we drive all have headlamps, so why do we have so many street lights? That has always bothered me.   The last one of these maps had another chilling fact to reveal -- lots of fishing boats lights -- Japanese commercial fishing boats -- luring unsuspecting fish and squid up through the ocean waters to get caught at night. And people wonder why the world's food supply is dwindling?  Human beings are wasting resources right and left -- U can find example everywhere U look. Just go to the library or look at the National Geographic magazines, as they are a wonderful source for looking at today's problems.   The bottom line and short answer is human greed and waste. If we were to be conservative we would fare much better, but there is always some people who want more than their share of everything. The answers are so easy -- live a simpler life style -- from smaller houses to home cooked meals instead of eating out. Maybe this "recession" will wake people up. I hope so.

I feed them any way. I don't care if a game warden gives me a ticket I will always feed them. I do hunt and have a strong heard of deer and turkeys in the area that I live. During Feb., March, and April, which is the hard time for animals. I will dump a bag of crack corn out once a week. And also cut down a few hemlock trees that the deer devour. I feel I owe this bit of food to the deer for which I gain food from taking a couple during deer season.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Don't stop when spring comes. Food is not easy for wildlife to come by during the early spring.    We feed the birds (and the hangers-on, like squirrels) year-round, not so much to help them but to encourage them to decorate our postage-stamp-sized yard. They, in turn, keep the hawks around. When rats show up to share the feast (about once every 10-15 years), they are easy to remove. Incidentally, we don't put food on the ground at all. The house sparrows are sloppy feeders.    You can make a nice block of food from one part each of flour (or oatmeal), cornmeal, birdseed, and peanut butter, plus two parts rendered suet. Mix, cool, and form.|`|AA11569882	Don't forget the summer too.  Many town birds die in the summer because they have become so used to being fed from feeders and there aren't enough wild berries etc to eat.|`|cBPmVudFaa	They've survived the last millions of years. Why should they rely on us to feed them?|`|jQglJiMhaa	I have bird, deer, and squirrel feeders set up at my house, but more so that i can watch them closer.      I don't know what the situation is like in the UK, but i know here that birds don't run the risk of starving is anyone discontinues the use of a feeder.  that is a myth. While birds tend to stay around when you are consistent with putting out food, they search for food in many places. The food you serve is only a portion of what they eat. They also feed on berries and insects. If you stop feeding them, whether it be that you went away for vacation or stopped due to a problem with your feeder, they will not go hungry.  Besides, the birds you are seeing are probably not the same ones that were there yesterday.    I think everyone should naturscape their property, just because its easier to maintain, looks good, and it good for the wild life.  NatureScaping is a method of landscaping that allows people and nature to coexist. By incorporating certain plants, especially native ones, into your yard you can attract insects, birds, and other creatures.    I do not think you have the right to condemn anyone for not feeding wildlife.  I could condemn more people for not having a certifiable naturscaped property, but why, i do it because i enjoy it, if other people don't do it, that's their choice and its rude and ignorrant to think they are any less for it.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Chuck all leftover cooking scraps out the window.

C7CaNLGlaa	It depends on the situation.  I'm willing to agree to disagree and leave it at that.  What I will not do is compromise my beliefs just for the sake of getting along.      The waters of global warming, global cooling, and climate change have been muddied so badly it's hard to figure out what is an outright lie, and there are many, and what is hard legitimate science.      The issue I take with it is, so many environmentalists up to and including Al Gore are telling the rest of us what to do, how to live, and how to it.  Then they, themselves are not doing what they tell us to do.  This is where I find the movement of AGW to be suspect.  Okay, whatever, I'll accept that as hypocracy and since we're all hypocrites at one point or another, I'll let it go.      But then we get into the issue of say, Al Gore's carbon credits.  This is a made up thing that is unregulated by the government and people are being cowed into paying it.  And what are carbon credits?  Some nebulous idea that has no real product being bought and sold.  But it is making Al Gore and company fabulously wealthy.      I have lived long enough also to see that this is just another manufactured scare, just like everything else.  We are in a constant state of being held in fear, while being kept busy to allay those fears.      I'm all for a cleaner Earth.  But I'm not going to separate chicken bones from greasy containers, and have five different recycling bins for several different materials, that may or may not be recycled anyway.  because I put them on the wrong side of the driveway.    I also find AGW to be suspect because it follows the pattern of all the other scare noises I've seen.  There was a time we thought Russia was going to wipe the USA of the map.  Then there was the "energy crisis" of the 1970's. then the Arab Oil Embargo.  We've been threatened with a mini ice age, then acid rain, then holes in the ozone and we would all die in five minutes from sun exposure, than there was AIDS.    Remember AIDS?  It was supposed to wipe out a third of the world's population, definitely a happy day for the anti-human people among us.   Billions have been spent on AIDS and now it doesn't have the importance it used to.  Then came the Bird FLu, than it was SARS, then it was Y2K, then we had color coded terrorist warnings, and have global warming and climate change.  Through it all, everything we eat and drink is a potential cancer factory and now we're headed for another ice age and man is causing it.      You get to a point where you feel like someone is flicking their finger on your forehead, or undergoing Chinese water torture.  Eventually it all becomes noise and when people stop paying attention, and stop writing checks to some nebulous idea, it's time to unsettle them again with a new scare.  To which I would probably sigh and think, "Not this crap all over again!"|`|ywOqliwKaa	Are there still "Believers" that have no skepticism even after hundreds, if not thousands, of scientists around the world have other theories? If there is then it is a religious following like the Radical Islamic Fundamentalists.     Since you cannot "reason" with religious fanatics, it is futile to try and discuss compromise.|`|f64a2a4ada0fcb1ea5303362c0bca8efaa	Because environmentalist have their own concept on how they see the world and can not accept any other possibilities.|`|AsKWImpQaa	One thing we can do is to not block anyone and let people see our questions and answers--that way people could go back and check on whether they've turned out to be correct or not.    I've done that, how about you?|`|YmXTatN4aa	how about we all agree that a 1degree Celsius up or down temperature change in a hundred years is indistinguishable from the back ground noise of our current measuring methods.    I have to agree with peter.jungman. he has a very good point|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Sure - a rational compromise would be to agree to the following:    The Earth warmed about 1.2 degrees F over 120 years, and since then temperatures have overall remained stable but have not since increased.    The beginning of this warming period occurred as a 450-year global cool period, known as the Little Ice Age, was ending.    A trace gas in the atmosphere traps heat.   Mankind has increased the atmospheric concentration of that gas by about 30%, to about 400 parts per million, over 200 years.    There have been other comparable warm periods since the last Ice Age ended, and that occurred at times when CO2 levels were lower than today (if you don't believe that two of them were warmer, fine, but it doesn't matter - we had hundreds of years at 1930s temperatures on at least three occasions and no runaway warming).    Scientists do not fully understand what caused those warm periods.    Therefore we cannot simply infer causation from correlation - that a modest increase in CO2 caused the present warm period.    But the prior warm periods do not DISPROVE man-made global warming either.    Despite the fact that ten of billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent over the last two decades specifically to attempt to prove man-made global warming, it remains unproven - but someday it might be proven.    Until then, the political implications of this unproven theory depend on your politics - if you value individual liberty over the power of the State, then you'd conclude that there should be no limits or taxes placed on individual activity for the purpose of protecting against a phenomenon - man-made global warming - that has not been proven to exist.|`|JmSHwiEFaa	Let's be clear about one thing.  The people who need to compromise or back off a bit are those that are involved in politics (namely politicians).  These are the ones who distort and misuse information for their own agendas.    Scientists, however, have a more delicate situation.  While they would like to research whatever their curiosity tells them to, society demands that their research be useful to civilization.  This, unfortunately, has led some scientists to try to "sell" their research by writing popular books and going on speaking tours.    The divide between science and 'the people' has been quite a problem for some time now.  How do scientists relay their findings to the public?  Most findings are not certain, so at what point of certainty and agreement amongst a community should they raise a flag?  And how do they communicate this uncertainty (a nice example is the probability paths we always see when there's a hurricane)?    Ultimately, the IPCC is a review and synthesis of a lot of research.  I cannot compromise the idea that these scientists are honest and intelligent people.  Could it be that some are manipulating their findings?  Yes, but I refuse to believe that this is the norm.  Thus, I will also - on the whole - be uncompromising about the findings of the IPCC.  I won't stick to every word they've said, but I do believe their work overall (and I really urge everyone to read it, you might say parts of it are a load of crap... but you will also learn a lot).    What I can compromise on is how we should behave in the face of these warnings.  Ultimately, we will have to get off our fossil fuel kick at some point - whether it's 100 or 500 years down the road - coal and oil won't last forever because we are using them faster than they're being replenished.  So why not let us be the ones to figure out how?  I think there is legitimate debate about how, and I certainly can compromise in this area.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	I wouldn't object to taking some action to offset CO2 levels in the air to deal with possible unforeseen consequences of higher atmospheric CO2.    If someone could find  way to produce renewable energy in a commercially viable way then that's great.  Some people alreay have commercially viable alternative energy like for power generation in remote areas and for solar hot water systems.    The world doesn't need more junk science in any field.  It's never a force for good.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	There is nothing to comprimise.  Skeptics comprimise, the future of their children and the truth.  All skeptical evidence to the contrary has been proved time and time again to be false.  They produce no new evidence, just keep repeating the same old Bull.    Every scientific research project to this day supports and proves that Global Warming is a fact, that humans have caused it, and that this is process of warming is accelerating.       Should we continue down this path, we are for sure on a road to destruction and ruin.    The people challenging this are the same that cause the most pollution, cleaning up their act will cost them dearly. These same people have been profiteering for so long, it's about time they put something back into the system.  Any further delay will only increase the cost to future generations.  These energy and oil concerns obviously put profits way ahead of peoples future security. Don't these people have children ?  OK, taking their advice we do nothing, but only on condition. That they insure their beliefs with financial compensation if they are wrong.  There is not ONE insurance company in the world that would offer insurance of this kind, NOT ONE and WHY ?|`|vfubWXFMaa	Compromise between two radically different ways peoples minds are wired is not going to be easy in any way. The warmers are mostly if not totally of what is known as inductive personality or mentality. They need a cause and it has to be provided for them because they are incapable of finding it on their own. So they make great faithful followers of a movement that they are able to accept and believe strongly in. But they are completely unable to do independent research to validate or invalidate the position they have chosen to follow.    The other basic mental personality type is called deductive. This mental type which in nature is rather rare needs to investigate the truth of any position presented to him/her to see if it is valid or not. So this person is a natural skeptic and will not hold any belief that cannot be solidly supported by volumes of evidence.    So how can two groups where one is satisfied with smoke and mirrors because it looks good and feels and the other requires demonstrable evidence that can be verified by any reasonable well educated person with average equipment ever find a compromise. This is why the warmers are happy with peer review and skeptics require validation through scientific method. The two mental functions are not now and never will be compatible because we frustrate each other totally. And this is why the discussion will continue!|`|6bEarQzdaa	no one knows our future for sure. but im doing my little bit to save the planet.|`|1fee420808aabf67636dc09772eb45cfaa	Great question.  I've always thought we should focus on the common ground of punching holes in the current pointless CO2 control proposals.    NASA Director Dr. James Hansen and I both want 4th generation clean nuclear power, distrust dogmatic knee-jerk environmentalists, oppose the Kyoto treaty and its follow-on mistakes (Bali), and strongly oppose the U.N. recommendation that China and India be completely free from emission controls.    http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2...    In other words, all current CO2 tax and control proposals should be avoided.    Is there anything not to like on that list so far?|`|JXIDPe4Aaa	The problem is the skeptics (such as my dad and other conservatives) think there is nothing wrong and do not see any reason to take any steps in solving the issues. Where as the rest of the world think desperate times call for desperate measures. The skeptics are fine with finding alternatives for oil but mostly for economic reasons. Any compromise would probably be more in line with what the skeptics want. The believers want to work fast, and the skeptics wouldn't mind wouldn't mind more economic friendly things but they don't see the rush. If the believers could come up with ideas that were good for the economy and slow paced, skeptics wouldn't have a problem.|`|t0O71Olzaa	It is the issue of the "MAN MADE" part that is the problem.  what you want to compromise on is the whole basis of the Global warmest agenda.   Now do most people agree that "man" should be good stewards of the earth? YES.   but being good stewards means to bring a balance to things.   we need industry and technology to live our lives. But not at the expense of uncontrolled pollution.   nether do we want an earth with out man. there are those that would like to see man removed form the earth. (man as in humans).  the two extremes.   but to truly answer your question with this. "follow the money trail"   who is to gain the most wealth by this frenzy? who owns what companies? and how loud are they speaking on its behalf?   the ones shouting down everyone else gets herd the most. Even what they say is not the truth. You tell a lie long enough it becomes the truth, and keep any one from saying otherwise by calling them heretics. Then burn them at the verbal stake.    there is compromise; only if it is wanted.|`|boZVHPfgaa	That's a very interesting question Mr Jello.    I believe that this video explains one such compromise very well! http://www.youtube.com/user/wonderingmin...    Now, just pretend for a moment that you believe in AGW. This means, in short, that you believe that our world is in a process of changing, and many of us will see terrible problems occur within our lifetimes, our children will not be safe, and it is even possible that we may pass an irreversible tipping point where there will be no more chances to turn back and civilisation as we know it will utterly collapse.    You also believe that we need to act fast to stop this, and that at the moment we aren't doing anywhere near enough. The only way for us to do enough is for the human race to collectively acknowledge this threat and face it. However, many people aren't doing this. A lot are even actively working to promote the idea that it is a hoax/scam/lie/unscientific. How then, do you react to this?    If you can go down this thought path, and maybe watch the video above, then we may be a lot closer to reaching this compromise you speak of.    For my own part? I will agree with you on one thing. I seriously hope that you're right and that it has all been some ghastly mistake or something! I also invite you to personal message me if you like, so that we can have a friendly, respectful discussion about the issue, understand each other's point of view better, and come to a better idea of what might be a good compromise. How does that sound?|`|NjjzRMBRaa	Dr. Jello.  You seem very logical in your past approaches to questions and have a very good understanding of the question you just posed.  I believe you know the answer and the answer lies in why the conservatives and the liberals can never get along.  In my opinion, socialists (liberals) like to follow someone and follow blindly, never mind if its right or wrong.  I have always thought how gullible some of these people are who will believe in a faith that has no facts.  It is almost like Gore is their god or their team and nothing can change their mind, even logic and science.      I am fighting an issue in California right now on formaldehyde where the World Health Organization and other organizations including the EPA has stated that California has overemphasized the problem by up to 36,000 times.  Only when one crosses the state border into California does this natural compound become bad enough to outlaw.      Well, people are losing their jobs over this and the issue of global warming.  As in the past, these same types of people have shouted out on many subjects of upcoming ice age, acid rain, you name it, they came up with it, all to be forgotten a few years later.      Dr. Jello, I think you already know the answer to your question.|`|gOBtB16caa	There is fighting because it is no longer about the science, it's about being right.      I have openly stated we should do more to clean up the environment, but I do not want to be taxed (extra) for it.  Corporations should pay for their own clean up, it should not come through government grants (aka OUR money).    I agree that politicians and the media should stay out of the argument and let the scientists dictate the findings.  We will actually get somewhere with this theory if that happens.|`|t1zlbOURaa	I don't believe in negotiations with terrorists. They must be defeated.|`|bRfLyvPIaa	I tend to side with much of what the alarmists say, but they take it way too far. To be fair, the other side takes it way too far as well.    The alarmists talk about the pending Apocalypse global warming will bring. But that's just pessimism talking. People have the ability to adapt to a wide variety of ecological conditions, and there's simply no reason to think we couldn't adapt to a warmer future. And warming could have benefits to humanity, in the same way the Medieval Warm Period did. Of course we don't know for sure, and there's some justification to the argument that since we don't know we should err on the side of caution. But some of the recommendations by the alarmists seem incautious to me.    On the other side are the economic conservatives who claim that doing anything about global warming would be economically catastrophic, costing trillions of dollars. But of course that's a lie. I switched to compact fluorescent light bulbs early, but since then I've run the numbers and I actually save about $75 in lighting costs for each bulb I buy. That's not costing more, it's costing less. BP invested about $20 million on efficiency measures in 2005, bowing to pressure from the British government, and they estimate that in the intervening 3 years they've saved about $630 million. Once again, not a cost, but a savings. Meanwhile American companies did nothig because W was sure it would destroy our economy if they did. Aren't we all glad the Republicans saved the economy for us? It's in great shape (that's sarcasm, in case you failed to notice).    The right wing bows to the "free" market (actually they promote laissez faire, not free-market capitalism, but that's another rant) and think government regulations are necessarily bad. I can't believe anybody would still think that, after the mess deregulation has made of the economy, but apparently some still do. They're simply wrong.    The government should mandate that we make our economy more efficient. That we use fewer resources and utilize more sustainable resources. We should do that because efficiency is a good thing, but the corporations won't do it unless they're made to. But if the warming trend ends, and some other source is found for it other than CO2, many people who are not part of the far right wing will dismiss everything liberal because liberalism has become so closely associated with alarmism. That's my real worry.
8cILhNsnaa	Me and my partner saved for 2 years to get enough money for a deposit on our first house - are struggling to pay mortgage,counciltax,electric, food &heating bills etc and often sit in the cold. We cant afford to go out, cant buy anything thats not essential and work 50 hour weeks each. On the flipside - If I choose not to work or got myself pregnant on purpose (which some people do to get all of this free) i would have been given a house/car everything would be paid for, and would have all the time in the world to spend time together which  we miss out on because we work for what?   The couple next door - dont work because they say "why should we" and say "we dont want to" and they are having a great time- yesterday they carried in a new 50" Plasma Tv and new sofa- Whilst we rely on hand - me-downs ! They dont pay a penny towards the house which is identical to ours!  I feel that no one helps us out and we do everything right! Pay our taxes and are law abiding. Where is the incentive to WORK and do it all right? asposed to relying on the state for the rest of your life.  The system is twisted and its getting harder.   Kids when asked at 7 years old what they want to be when they grow up?  will be answering NOTHING as why work when you dont have to!

So we need to all strive to be a part of the population that tries to make changes.   Only when things are changed from the top down will the freeloaders have to start puling their weight.  U have to understand that the fat cats near the top of the food chain need a certain amount of people from which to draw their workers and soldiers from, and these people will come from the pool of low income households.

It is a debatable question -- no doubt about it. I have enjoyed watching modern zoos improve a lot over the years. Things like more space, better food, more toys to play with. etc. Boredom is a big problem with the bigger animals. I have mixed emotions about zoos, as I personally know several zoo keeps and I know how attached to the animals they are.

Zoos can do good work in captive breeding and keeping a reservoir of endangered species if their natural habitat is threatened, but we must try and restore such habitats to allow such species to thrive.     Zoos can only keep a fraction of the wildlife that a habitat contains. What about the plants, algae, lichens, fungi, or the small invertebrates and animals which it is almost impossible to keep in captivity? Remember zoos are captivity, i.e. captive, not free, animals.|`|yHbX1hspaa	Many animals that are in zoos require thousands of kilometers of space to roam comfortably. For example, the tiger: they're meant to travel the African plains but instead they're forced to live in cramped cages.     Zoos aren't the natural habitat of the animals, so therefore they cannot have a natural life. Recent studies show the artificial captive environment can generate intrinsic animal welfare problems such as:        * Abnormal behaviors such as self-mutilation; feeding disorders; and stereotypical behavior (e.g. pacing, neck twisting, or rocking).      * Reproductive disorders.      * Physiological unbalances.    An example of this behavior is the polar bear in the Dublin zoo who was moved because of signs of stress and boredom. This magnificent animal had nothing to do but walk from one side of the enclosure to the other (pacing); it was eventually moved to the Czech Republic to a much larger enclosure.    Many people think that zoos are preserving endangered species or subspecies, but in fact they are wrong. Ninety-five percent of animals that are kept in zoos aren't endangered. Ninety-seven percent of these animals aren't part of the European Captive Breeding Programs, and less than 1 percent of endangered animals have been introduced back into the wild. Research by the Born Free Foundation has brought these facts into the public domain. (BFF is an organization dedicated to the welfare of animals by demanding that they be kept in their natural environments.)    Zoos seem to be friendly environments, but what many people don't know is that since 1990, 42 people have been killed and 100 others injured by elephants worldwide in zoos. In the year 2000, more than 400 rhesus macaques (monkey) -- found to be carrying herpes B -- were required to be shot in UK zoos. Although not lethal to the monkeys, herpes B can be fatal to humans. In the last two years, 13 people in the UK have contracted salmonella from pet reptiles. In some way, these facts prove that animals shouldn't be kept in zoos because they carry diseases that can't harm themselves but can kill humans.    If the animals are kept in zoos, their skills will be lost. The cheetah, for example, is the fastest land animal in the world, but when it's confined in small cramped cages, it isn't able to run at those speeds. Therefore, the skill won't be needed and it will eventually wither away. Another animal like this is the tiger: its teeth are among the most powerful in the world, used for ripping flesh from the bone but if it is kept in zoos there's no need for them and they'll become weaker and wither away also. You could say that zoos interfere with Mother Nature.    Another negative point is climate change. Is it right to put a tropical animal into a Russian zoo or a polar bear into the Australian zoo? It's even more important to keep animals where they belong because the climate is changing due to global warming and they need to evolve naturally.|`|AA10338771	Because living creatures don't like nor they deserve to be kept in captivity!

taEGA9PNaa	Steroids to fatten cattle and hormones to make the produce more milk.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Good question ~~~ The cows are exposed to sooooo much chemistry. In the barns and out into the fields. If only people knew. There are devices that cattle can rub up against, because they like to scratch themselves, that dispense a pesticide automatically onto their backs and sides when thy do this. Then there are methods of dipping or dunking cattle, where they herd them through a chute and through a trough that is so deep they are forced to swim for a few seconds, and that gets the chemicals into their eyes, ears, etc.   This is why my children were raised without milk or dairy products as a regular part of their diet. We do eat these things occasionally now that they are teenagers, but at least my kids know that they are ingesting a food that is not the best. I am old enough to remember when milk and cream did taste good, but my body does better without milk in general, as would most people's if only they were tuned into the idea of listening to the Universe when it whispers to them.   And finally just the way that milk is processed makes it taste different. The process of homogenization breaks up the molecules in such a way as to transform the whole product.   Have U ever looked at the ingredient list on the so called "milk" that they feed school kids? It should make your hair curl. It is like feeding the students liquid ice cream -- sugar & flavoring & dyes & all. Unbelievable.

AsKWImpQaa	I'm not sure of the exact number, but certainly large amounts of the snowpack could disappear in a warming climate, especially in the Northern Sierra.    Some answers claim that California is a desert--that is mostly only true for the areas that are sparsely populated.  All of the major population centers: the Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego are outside the desert. They are dry climates, primarily Mediterranean and Steppe, but not desert. In Southern California, we import about 80% of our water, both from the Colorado River and Northern California.    Some also think that since water needs to be moved around that we should give up on agriculture.  If people start feeling that way, they might as well give up on modern society entirely, that's what people do: we manufacture things one place, grow things another, bring water to where the land is fertile and the climate ideal for growing. I happen to live in a place where food can be grown year-round, but many people don't--should we condemn then to only eating canned food and packaged goods? Perhaps in some future utopia everything will be done locally, but we're nowhere near that now or in the immediate future.    That brings me to another point, are people that live in other states so foolish as to think that California's agriculture doesn't matter to you? Think again, California is the number one state for agriculture, and many of the foods on your table originate here. If it's not grown here you'll pay higher prices for it from somewhere else, and for certain crops there will be no domestic supply at all.    California's looming water shortage would be less of an issue with a smaller population, but that's true about virtually all of the problems in the world.

In the '70s snow would arrive by early November and skiing was good by Thanksgiving, but this decade I camp until early December, we're luck if the resorts are open at all by Dec 20 (I've been working in the industry for the last few years so the latest Winters are particularly frustrating), and the first decent large storm often arrives in the week leading up to New Years Eve.  We didn't even get that storm this year, and multiple Januarys in a row have been very dry.    Research at U.C. Davis on the Tahoe Basin has confirmed the long term trend towards lower Sierra snowpack.  It sounds like Chu is simply aware of the latest findings.      Let's also look as Chu's BEST CASE scenario...    Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, noted that even the most optimistic climate models for the second half of this century suggest that 30 to 70 percent of the snowpack will disappear. Theres a two-thirds chance there will be a disaster, Chu said, and thats in the best scenario.  http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/magazi...    Here's another factor affecting the outlook for California water:    There is a 50 percent chance Lake Mead will run dry by 2021 and a 10 percent chance it will run out of usable water by 2014...  "We were stunned at the magnitude of the problem and how fast it was coming at us," said marine physicist Tim Barnett.   http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...    Yet I'm not aware of a single urban planning district curtailing their expansion plans, even slightly.  It's bizarre.  People certainly have an enormous capacity for living in denial!    It's funny to see people waving their arms wildly in an attempt to rationalize away scientific studies.  The opportunity to make bundles of money publishing any actual evidence to the contrary is huge... The oil and coal industries alone would pay hundreds of millions of dollars to get their hands on any such data (ExxonMobil pays tens of millions already to at least get some entertaining fiction published).  Capitalism itself is threatened by global warming theory, yet the entire financial resources of the developed world can't produce a single study to provide alternate data, or at least uncover an alterantive explanation?  Hmm, I wonder why... maybe the cumulative data and predictions of thousands of scientists are accurate and their concerns are well-founded?      If anything, recent ice melt measurements suggest that scientists' predictions are turning out to be far too optimistic.    Of course that won't mean much to people locked in a psychological state of denial.  They'd prefer to believe conspiracy theories about thousands of scientists coordinating some sort of secret plot, that no scientist has the ethics to reveal and that skeptical scientists somehow are excluded from exposing.  Ooooo... scary... sounds like a bad plot from one of Michael Crighton's fictional works.

Already we're using ALL of the water from the river, mostly for agriculture.  It would not take much reduction in flow to really put a hurt on California farmers.    I think the worst-case scenario is really unlikely.  This is probably based on the notion that global warming will be 2.5 to  9 degrees C over the next century.  Global climate is an issue with too many variables--some of which we haven't yet discovered--to accurately predict change.  For example, there are plants that grow more rapidly when exposed to higher temperatures, and plants that grow more rapidly when exposed to higher concentrations of CO2.  Plant growth tends to absorb CO2, to pull it out of the atmosphere.  But how much?  How fast?  Well, that depends on what plants and where, whether they begin growing in new areas as the climate warms.  Also, the high-end projections rely on an exponential growth in carbon emissions, which would require exponential economic growth as well.  As we've seen in recent months, when demand for oil grows too quickly, the entire world economy shuts down.    Whether we fully understand the climate or not, we can observe a trend (last frosts growing earlier, glaciers receding, snow-pack disappearing) to say that the world is warming, and we can predict it will continue to warm.  How much warming, and how quickly--that gets beyond what I know how to calculate.  Other people claim 2.5 to 9, that's a really loose estimate--but the higher end of that scale is far less likely.    If a 2.5 degree rise is virtually certain, as some people claim, there will be a huge loss of water in the Colorado River.  Any reduction in the Colorado's flow will mean less water for California farmers, and that's going to hurt us all.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	I just want to say it's really irritating that whenever a global warming-related prediction with negative consequences is made, so many people dismiss it offhand as "alarmism".  It wouldn't matter on what these predictions were based or what their degree of likelihood was, they're outright dismissed.  I mean geez, if somebody yells at you "look out for that truck!", is that alarmism?  I guess not, since it's not global warming related.    Anyway, Chu is basing his comments on climate modeling. This is a prediction which as far as I'm aware, all climate models agree upon.  It's not like he's just making a wild guess - it's based on solid well-established science.      As a matter of fact, we're already starting to see it happen.    The California state Department of Water Resources just predicted that "We may be at the start of the worst California drought in modern history."  Guess why?  Because the Sierra snowpack is too low.  http://www.usatoday.com/weather/drought/...    And not only is the Sierra snowpack decreasing, but Northern California is also set to receive less precipitation.    "Southern California is already subtropical in the summer. But with climate change, dry conditions could spread to areas like northern California, Washington and Utah, which now get far more rain and snow."  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16...    Now I know a lot of deniers would like nothing more than to see California suffer a massive drought, since by their comments, they clearly harbor very negative feelings for the state.  However, California is the country's largest agricultural producer.  http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-...    So this prediction is going to have major impacts on the whole country.  I think Chu is right on the money, we're already starting to see the decreasing snowpack taking effect, and it's going to have hugely negative impacts not only on California, but on the food supply of the whole country (and even the world).|`|19f1c57afa6b5d53c15d469229319a28aa	I don't think much of it really, case in point Dr Hansen's infamous worst case scenario in 1988 that failed to materialize, in fact observations tracking below the best case scenario C.

That would make the article a distortion of the facts, wonder why?|`|aeVz0lrBaa	My very basic undertanding of the weather / climate is that 'La Nina' brings with it dry, warm conditions to the US (i.e. in CA) and during 'El Nino', wet weather and increased snowfall to the region (esp. Sierra) are common place.    so I guess if El Nino events cease to exsit, then Chu will be correct in what he says, but if El Nino's continue he'll be wrong.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Climate change could boil the Pacific Ocean.    It won't however.    It's just more fear-mongering. And, yes, it's moronic for that many people to live in the middle of a desert and think they should have water in the first place.    Maybe we should advocate that California forcibly reduce its population because there are too many people living in a place that doesn't have enough naturally occurring resources?

kqa9VFrfaa	The advances in technology are not the real issue. In fact cancer has been cured many times over already, but the government does not want U to know that because it would stop the money flowing into research and treatments of patients, (Long story there, but U go research this on your own) AIDS was man-made in the first place -- don't even get me started on that one.  What mankind needs is common sense, and to stop polluting. Then we could focus on the basics like food/water/shelter.    So until humans stop being greedy and can love their fellow man, it does not matter what technology we come up with. Human beings have been going downhill spiritually ever since the start of the industrial revaluation. I am not against new technology, I just do not see where it has uplifted humans as a whole. Only those at the top of the food chain benefit. All U have to do is take something as simple as disposable baby diapers to see how lazy that made moms in general, and how bad they are for the landfills. Very polluting. Did U know that people who tour the plants that manufacture those diapers have to wear special suits like the farmers wear when handing poison chemicals?  There are so many things that the general public is so blissfully ignorant of. Look at the robots being used in war -- they are going to get better and better. So will we stop having wars? Don't think so. The next thing that will happen is major fighting over the basics of life -- water, food, land, space for daily living.

I would never use a microwave to cook regular meals in because of how it works on the molecular structure of the food.  On rare occasions I have used a microwave at work to heat things up.

TBsVmUoCaa	The main problem I see with whaling is through the question: how much whaling is "too much" whaling and can various whale species sustain its population afterward?     Whaling is pretty profitable due to it's commercial use in food, cosmetics, and other uses I'm not familiar of. The demand is huge in asian countries, especially Japan.     Whaling hasn't been a moral issue given the fact that whaling been around since humans invented boats to hunt for food in oceans. It's only recently when people realized killing anything larger than human is inhumane, and any form of killing by humans should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, such as the need for food or scientific research.    Seeing how scientists can estimate (scientifically) how many whales are left on this planet, I would say the solution to whaling is to put a strict quota per nation per year. It's already the case, but I don't think it's strict enough and enforcement is almost nonexistent. Declaring products made from whales illegal to trade is the first step to stop whaling, like what we did with elephant tusks. I think more importantly is for the consumers to realize we are putting whales in danger of extinction by buying commercial products made from whale body parts, and that we can all stop that from happening before it's too late.    Honestly, I support moderate whaling, but I hate to say this, whaling is one of those things that a selected few ruins it for the majority people. As for whether it's humane or inhumane, that's for you to ask yourself in the mirror, "do I kill animals for food or do I kill plants for food?"|`|Nb3etnqCaa	The causes of whaling are that some people eat whale meat and that there are a lot of whales. The problems and solutions of whaling probably involve using the right harpoon and finding a way to process a carcass that big.    Seriously, there is no problem. Years ago there was a lot of whaling and some species were hunted to the brink of extinction. Then, most nations got together and agreed to ban whaling except in certain circumstances.     The Japanese, for example, are allowed to take a small number of a completely non-endangered whale every year. This doesnt, in any way, threaten the whales as a species.    Some people might not like the idea of whales being killed for food, and I actually agree. But modern whaling is not causing any kind of environmental problems.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The whales are in serious danger, even though people do not use whale oil for lighting any more. The Japanese are the biggest offenders, Go to Green Peace for good whale info. They have been active in saving the whales for a long time. They pictures of the giant whaling ships will make U sick.   The only humans who I believe have the right to hunt whales are the northern peoples of Canada and Alaska or any native people of cold climates, who use small boats and really put themselves at risk to do so.   As a side note, I was appalled at the Japanese commercial fishing boats that hang out on the west coast of USA and troll for fish and squid at night using huge artificial lights. I just recently saw a satellite map of this from National Geographic. Another good source of info by the way.   Good luck and keep up the good work.
68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	Last week Dana suggested that California may be entering the worst drought in modern history.  This week a inconvenient obstacle.

I can think of several solutions right now that could be implemented from low cost quickly to high cost in a few years.    1st large ocean going tugs and tankers. Tugs to bring in icebergs to ports that need water desperately and second tankers to recover the water from melting ice the warmers keep telling us about. This would alleviate the immediate crisis quickly and easily.    2nd implement rain water conservation recovering the rain into storage where it can be used instead of just letting it run down the flood control channels into the sea and be wasted.    3rd instead of directing the outflow of sewage treatment plants into the rivers or oceans redirecting it to input regions of natural aquifers where it will through natural means replenish the aquifer with clean fresh water and this same process could supply nutrients to forests to make them healthier.    4th Additional nuclear power plants to run desalinization plants to locally make fresh water from salt.    5th Do something like the current canals that bring water from the Sacramento delta and Colorado river now to bring water from Washington state where they have more water than they need to the other western states that could use it rather than just let it run back to the ocean without ever being used.    There are probably some more good prospects for solving the problem, but these are easy and fairly cheap to implement with available resources.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	You mean we might have severe droughts like they had in the MWP?

It would be funny if it weren't so sad that some people really are so paranoid.      Roughly 6% of people believe that the lunar landing never occurred, and that same percentage of people don't believe in global warming.

Even though the bulk food store has plastic bags, the packaging is much less than if you would buy it at the grocery store on the shelf.|`|wHVx9HZVaa	Add a little water to finished milk cartons and use this to water your plants. Good for your plants and saves any left over milk from going down the pipe to pollute rivers.  Empty the contents of your hoover into your compost.  Batteries can be recycled but once you have buy rechargeables so you won't have to dispose of them so often.  Newspapers are great for improving your soil. Spread them wet over your vege plot in the Autumn. By next spring they will have rotted, kept the weeds at bay and fed the soil.  Most shampoo/conditioner and cleaning product plastic bottles are recyclable.  Join Freecycle so someone can have your chuck outs and put them to good use rather than going to landfill.  http://www.freecycle.org/  Take plastic plant pots (especially the large ones they cost a lot!) back to you local nursery/garden centre.  Fill old tea cups and mugs with fat and use them as bird feeders hung in a tree with a piece of string/wire through  the handle.  Use polystyrene from packaging to crock pots.   Use odd socks to dust.  Take magazines you no longer want to the waiting room of the local GP, vet etc.|`|CDDH2YAvaa	Send your old cell phones to http://www.recyclephones.org|`|yLQA277eaa	paper , card and ink cartridges anything that has a symbol really , although not every where has everything in place just be patient.|`|HXIRVFOzaa	There are so many great ideas.  Styrofoam plates etc are not re-recyclable  in York Region, although they do carry the symbol.  Be sure to remove plastic windows from spaghetti boxes etc.    I have begun re-using bread bags for storing cheese, etc.  Once done, because most contain symbols, they all go to Giant Tiger, where they have a recycle plastic bag container.  If you do use regular grocery bags in your garbage or green bin, do NOT tie super tight, as they want to be able to separate at the plant.|`|LkmsTN2Taa	To add to greenfingers gardening tips on finding other uses for certain items -   1)  use clear plastic lemonade bottles, cut in half as mini propagators  2)  the smaller plastic pop bottles with a small hole drilled in the lid work as spouts or funnels for watering plants in containers and hanging baskets.    3)  Compost bags turned inside out make good hanging basket liners.   4)  Plastic and ceramic bowls - such as provided with pates, trifles, xmas puddings etc make good and decorative containers to put house plants in especially cacti.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	recycling does not just mean putting things in the right bin as most people think. if we reuse items we already have for different purposes so  we don't need to buy  anything for that job for e.g  these throw away wipes that most people use today, why not use an old cloth a vest or old towel cut up it will save money too, containers that some foods come in can be used in the garden/greenhouse for growing seeds. all one needs really is imagination there is a second use for most things instead of binning them.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	Some of the things that I recycle daily are: Cardboard and other food boxes (example: rice, pancake, and spaghetti type boxes) newspapers, magazines, and other paper, aluminum, and plastics (examples: plastic detergent bottles, water bottles, juice jugs), just about everything has the recycling symbol on it.
JEb2Kqd4aa	No, they are different. a clam is a burrowing marine mollusk living?on sand or mud while a mussel is a marine or freshwater bivalve mollusk that lives attached?to rocks etc
kqa9VFrfaa	Very hard to help U if we don't have details. My family takes advantage of me all the time -- my kids run right over the top of me. I am too easy going and they know that their dad will not back me up all the time. So all I can say to U is to stand up for your self as much as U can and be reasonable about it. Try to look at other people's point of view first, and then if U determine that they are being unfair, do something about it. If U R too nice and easy going then stop being an easy mark. I know it is hard to do this sometimes but if U feel put upon then only U have the power to say "no".   I wish I could help U more but U do not say what it is that they are doing to U.|`|HvpEZrpvaa	Live ur life!! let them do the work by them self..!!|`|TADcaBIqaa	u be clever enough dat no one can reach u...|`|4XlWLeSsaa	stop bendin over for em...stand up...brace for a fall..anybody helping you...you can forget their assistance..easily it seems..P.H..
