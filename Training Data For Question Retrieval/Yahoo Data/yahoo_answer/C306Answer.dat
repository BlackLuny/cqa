S6rB7GgFaa	When something is just funny smile instead of laughing. That's what I do! :)|`|tCiVuFK9aa	The only suggestion I have is if it's not funny, don't try to fake a laugh, just smile and big and say something witty like "you're not right".  Or just smile big. If you don't find it funny then you are faking a laugh and you can't change a fake laugh into a real laugh no matter how hard you try.<br>  Red|`|T1vgsbyKaa	Be yourself. If your laugh sounds fake, so what? Your friends shouldn't care about little things like that, and if they do, they aren't really your friends. If you do really wanna make your laugh sound differently, I would look up a specific laugh on the internet that you like, and practice it....(if thats not too wierd) But I would just go with being urself!

9b4950fa16a181fbbd9070d9ccb0a1b4aa	As a whole I'd have to go with THE RAINBOW CHILDREN (surprise! LOL)<br>  <br>  Despite having the odd slowed down voice message throughout and the single program release, it was funky. I absolutely adored the following songs:<br>  1+1+1 is 3<br>  The Work<br>  Sensual Everafter<br>  Everlasting Now<br>  <br>  The album was a nice mix of rock and funk which are two of the things the Purple one does the best! <br>  <br>  I'd have to put N.E.W.S. a close second just for wowing people that were non-Prince fans when I played it. They were so surprised that he'd do a jazz album and it came out so well. I think he got a Grammy nomination for it. Four 15 minute tracks and I loved them all. <br>  <br>  The other albums were ok. They each had a few songs and the rest were filler. I have a feeling LotusFlo3er and MPLSound will be the same come the end of this March! Hoping it'll exceed expectations though!!<br>  <br>  I've been doing some reviews of Prince's albums recently too.

I think maybe if there was a fourth movie it might concentrate on Amelia instead??? Rise of the Lycans wasn't directed by Len Wisemen who directed the first two movies (and who is married to Kate Beckinsale) so maybe if he were to direct a fourth movie in the series, Selene might return???|`|aHPDAqw0aa	God willing they will!|`|jDgO5ypJaa	o not soon enough in my opinion...<br>  <br>  i hope they do come out with a new one about selene and micheal....

If she takes him back after what he did to her, i will stop supporting her and her job. <br>  -fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.-<br>  meaning: if someone lies, cheats, hits, is mean, and they say they won't do it again, to bad, they should'nt have done it the first time.<br>  thats just my opinion,<br>  -kate|`|ttpNDSJNaa	I think that Rhianna would be a good and a bad role model if she takes back Chris Brown.

KXmEIKXLaa	I've heard all the rumors about it and I've noticed every year the release date is pushed back. I am greatly disappointed because I am one of the biggest Jurassic Park fans of all time, but there is no real evidence of a fourth movie coming anytime soon. Believe me I've done a ton of research on this "upcoming" film and all I can find are posters that are created by fans and scripts that are all completely different from each other. I think this was all started by a misunderstanding from the actors and producers of the third film who said the would be one possibly NOT definitely. It is unfortunate that a great series like Jurassic Park has come to an end but there is no evidence of it ever continuing:-(|`|zFUU8hrTaa	yes it's in the works|`|CvpgiMYtaa	Yup, and word is that the 'plot' is going to be a government devised plan to teach the dinosaurs to operate and shoot weapons. wow.|`|B43x5RF8aa	No. They thought about it but they could not come up with a good enough idea|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	yes

JbXUtNYvaa	no, scorpio are known for good sex. but majority would prefer to see the other person happy versus themselves. that is what makes them happy is knowning that they are the ones causing there partner that happiness. the reason they are known for good sex is cause of the creativity and the fact that they know what they like and arent afraid to say it in the bedroom and they are execellent at listening to what their partners want. very fun.|`|AA11301375	Im a Scorpio and that is so not true. If anything when it comes to sex we love to please and make our women happy. Don't believe the negativity you hear about Scorpios, especially when it comes to the bed.|`|eD687uffaa	not true /// we want to make you feel good///|`|CcgDj9GIaa	No no no!!<br>  <br>  Not true, the Scorpio man shows his emotions through his sexuality.  This is a type of man that will show you how much he loves you in between the sheets as well as away from the bedroom.  Be prepared, he is willing to give you his all through the bedroom, and that from a Scorpio is a good thing ;)

When, though I never experienced, I see a blue day ahead, I take it as a "painted day". And you know, I love colors. <br>  People who take a day as "blue day" (it's your term, not mine), simply waste a day. They miss two things: either they miss the other colors of the day due to blue or they miss the charisma of serene blue!<br>  I believe you have come to know me now, in what way I do cheer the days.|`|Rkt3lPw2aa	Ask myself:  What good could come out of this situation?  What am I grateful for?  Smile.  Just smile for no reason.  (Studies show that has an impact on a person's emotions.)

NEWbh3Plaa	I hate when I can't run.  Everything is in slow motion.  The same thing happens when someone is attacking me.

848c3c596d821d8f27c64a25f1db134eaa	I would put Great back into Britain if i was the prime minister,lol.The first thing id do is sort out the respect and behavior of kids in schools.That's where it all begins in my eyes.Kids just not showing adults one bit of respect and growing up doing worse stuff than that..when i was a kid me and mates were sh!t scared of police but these days kids just gob off at them.Which i find disgusting.Imagine how the world would be without the police.So start voting for me to be the next pm and i will make Britain great Britain again,lol.x|`|eCZtVCwaaa	i would start by recommending a few showers...<br>  <br>  nah seriously, I love you guys, great accent, nice people, too bad we beat you at cricket...|`|3w7ekDQJaa	less teenage suicides, more jobs for the people that actually live here and NOT IMMIGRANTS|`|ugXymVAhaa	It's still GREAT to me|`|HmqHf3qDaa	return it to the British,<br>  deport the hangers on|`|AA11656797	Same as it ever was..... it's no worse now.|`|zDJVWlscaa	Labour out.|`|s1nkkTPbaa	Stop making shepherd pies<br>  <br>  just a silly joke...GBR is a cool place with people that have rational minds|`|NfXRQ27Gaa	I would start by mass deportation of jobless, illegal or criminal immigrants, and the ones that are working I would make sure they were getting the right wage for the job, no more under cutting British workers, they would also have to be housed properly not 10 to a room in dosshouses, any sick immigrants would be sent back where they came from so as not to burden the British NHS, we pay in their countries so they should pay in ours, I would stop any more muslims fom coming here, they complain about everything and bleed us dry while trying to murder us with the money we have given them. any foriegner getting sent to jail would be deported as soon as they were released and never be allowed back in this country again, as you can see I believe this nass immigration is slowly dragging our country down to eastern european levels, it is time to stop it now.|`|mags2ekzaa	a great 2012 olympics|`|zfhTOfs5aa	if the island depopulated|`|m6CIhrgqaa	Get rid of the royal family & let me take the throne...|`|lwXEK969aa	Bring back the Red Coats!!!!|`|MNja3iwMaa	We could start by been proud of our country, instead of appologising all the time.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Letting Australia be an independant nation....and fielding a half decent cricket team.|`|4FqP313qaa	i think that ppl say that in whatever country they're in..its  just something to complain about. =||`|cgqgomawaa	i think if some of you hotter countries gave us some sun we'd be great again :)
uyQppMYLaa	It bugs me. I'm, at university and when people spend their lectures talking, playing on their phones, sleeping or simply don't turn up, it gets me really angry. We're so lucky to have such a good education system in our country, there are hundreds, if not thousands of people who would love to be where they are now, why are they wasting their opportunities? I'm paying a lot of money to be taught in this university, and it's so irritating when I can't concentrate because other people are messing about. If they don't want to work then fine, but don't stop me from doing it.|`|AfPKkYaKaa	i can't say i have no reason but i don't work<br>  <br>  i hate people who pretend work is something big and especially wanna put down people who don't work.  in situations like these (all situations like these) i will take not associating with people like that over having money<br>  <br>  like i'll work for a little bit of time but if it gets to the point where there about to reveal their personality or wanna get to know me it makes me shriek.  if they're one of those people.  some people have manners and are decent human beings<br>  <br>  like to be honest that's not the kind of person i want to be opening up to me and i'm scared shitless of it and i've almost lost hope

My husband is working out of state we will be joining him after our youngest is finished with the school year. We have been married for 23 years so I have missed him greatly. Only get to see him every other weekin. So Y/A has filled a whole in my heart so thankful an old friend brought me here. Helping others helps me, they have helped me too.

Thanks for letting me on board.|`|lILfQh6xaa	Well, out of your list hon, i dont know where i would fit in, but i care for all my contacts deeply. They are truly the reason i come here to Y/A on a daily basis. they mean so much to me. Some, more than others. but all have an important role as my contacts. From all walks of life and places. I had asked something similar to this a few weeks ago, that a gal referred to my contacts as my "mob". LOL! Thats awesome! Some i hear from either everyday or every other day. Some i would like to hear from more often than i do, but i understand that it goes both ways. Well, I dont, i am straight as an arrow. Well, not that, but i mean i prefer women. I think i will quit while i am ahead here. Not that i am a head. I cant say anything that you wont twist around hon. I love my contacts. Thats it. Im done.

nXOawSbCaa	I can juggle many balls at the same time..|`|VAxFUGsfaa	most deff can : )|`|lErNxNWVaa	To be able to multitask is rather essential in an office.  The only ones allowed to have tunnel vision are the bosses, whose job it is to focus on the issue at hand.  The others have to answer the phones, follow up queries from staff, clients, maintain files, etc etc all at exactly the same time.    The best example of people with this skill are Executive Assistants.  They are pretty on the ball people.|`|iddMxOroaa	Being the girly boy that I am, what do you think cc?<br>  <br>  Oh I'm sorry, you can't think and type at the same time can you?<br>  <br>  Shame!!|`|W7l1awFPaa	Multi is more than one right? Seriously though, as a man I don't see the point.  Why not concentrate on one thing until it is finished? That way I am sure that it is done properly and on time.|`|jdLmG2L5aa	I'm supposed to be doing study island, but I'm not, so is that multitasking? Otherwise, if I try, I fail miserbly.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Can you hang on a second, I'm trying to put cream cheese on my bagel and text my best friend.|`|PMGXddjgaa	That's a built-in for woman<br>  <br>  An option for men xxx|`|yl6kfpzpaa	No while I type I loose the ability to breathe|`|7TqFISbtaa	I can fart and sneeze at the same time , so yes I can|`|VEzi2Qvlaa	not very well but Debbie can|`|khnMoQNoaa	i can drink a beer while flicking though TV channels|`|WNfffzGiaa	Not very well.

6SCwpakRaa	Is this a funny joke?<br>  <br>  When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat the problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 billion to develop a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to 300 degrees Celsius. The Russians used a pencil. <br>  <br>  <br>  Lol yea i guess that still applies.|`|4YnoykD2aa	My very first question was asking what to do about abusive email. Yes, I guess it does still apply.

I'll check.<br>  <br>  Mine was about emo-ish poem I wrote. I had a serious depression. I'm fine now, not writing emo poems anymore.<br>  <br>  I just read it again... dang, it was 2 years.

Ross was my favorite.|`|URO3gDXcaa	no.  those whinny tw**s.|`|32juonR9aa	I am a huge fan of Friends, I got my best mate Jack stuck on it and we both talk about non-stop and own the box-set, scene-it game, the postcard set and a bunch of memorabillia between us. Our friends are sick of us talking about it!<br>  My favourite character was Phoebe as she was so funny and I know all her 'songs' of by heart. Monica was second best and I love the fact that her and Chandler got together and adopted the twins :).|`|zDJVWlscaa	Yes.<br>  Chandler.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Nope, for some reason, I just never watched that show or wanted to. hmm...|`|e1d902a1e3f67c79f0006f242202774daa	CHAAANDLERRR!!<br>  <br>  and phoebe when she snaps.

(I didn't want the textbook to squish my sandwich) and apparently she thought I took out the lunch to eat it in front of her as a sign of disrespect. When I showed the lady in the discipline office (no lie, that was the name) what I had "done" she told me that my teacher was full of it and we both sat, talked and ate lunch.|`|lQZUIkogaa	Yeah. I was in math class and I totally wasn't paying attention at all and then I started laughing about something and I couldn't stop laughing and the teacher made me go out on the porch for the rest of the class. I don't even remember what I was laughing about. lol.|`|WNfffzGiaa	I got kicked out of gym class frequently in middle school.<br>  I had an on-going battle with the teacher all three years.<br>  <br>  Once I was limping on a genuinely hurt ankle, and he sent me to the principals office.|`|JcZdLSJkaa	Not yet but probably will soon if I'm caught falling asleep <br>  hahaha|`|xiYjI33Qaa	that or i left because i was bored. not standing for the pledge, other dumb s**t|`|sgEloO1Jaa	which one|`|1bkiNiwzaa	A few times...<br>  for talking in class<br>  for laughing at the teacher<br>  for slamming my book down because i was angry that the teacher was giving us a lot of work<br>  <br>  Strangely not for sleeping in class although the teacher noticed it...she was nice.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	yeah... one time it was for yelling out "mermaid testicles!"

There is nothing wrong with a slap round the back of the legs , that does not make me a child abuser. I was also smacked as a child, because I had done wrong.  I have seen parents pleading with children to do as their told. Since when has the child been in charge. I know I come from a different generation but I don't see nothing wrong with it. And before I get loads of thumbs down, I am answering the question with my opinion. I don't agree with smacking a child round the head or face, that is wrong, but  I don't see nothing wrong with a slap on the legs|`|mtyhSPi9aa	yeah , my lil bro :-P<br>  <br>  we were playing around<br>  ok , well actually i was playing around with his cheeks :D|`|tc66dwQmaa	No, I never have "slapped a child"|`|zRUHryuraa	Yes, I like to beat children regularly|`|B3cPFhssaa	No.<br>  I've wanted to though at times,they can get so annoying lol|`|i8EMuPJiaa	Only person i've ever hit is my dad.. i didn't mean to it was the Wii !!

d2vENVGlaa	Okay, this is the plan.<br>  I'll distract the librarian/teacher on duty, by screaming "RAPE!" in the Autobiographies section (A-L).  This should give you a 30 second to 1 minute interval, within which you will open the said pack of M&M's (it shall be referred to as 'object X' for future reference).  However, timing is essential.  If in the case that my distraction fails to occupy the teachers limited mental capacities of attention span, I will cooee three times, followed by 2 short, 1 long and 4 intermediate length coughs, at which point you will instantly stop attempting to open object X.  If this is the case, I will then stalk upon the teacher, until we are in a relatively isolated area of the building.  I will then perform a headlock on the teacher (I will be wearing an acid green ski mask, as to protect my, and subsequently your, identity).  When I have the teacher subdued, I will repeat the above set of coughs, which will signal to you that you can safely and securely open object X.  You will then sort the M&M's by colour.  Once accomplished, pretend to drop your textbooks on the floor, which will function to alert me that the M&M's have been arranged in accordance to the visible spectrum.  I will then knock out the teacher, and before anyone suspects a thing, I will take all the yellow M&M's and escape through the pre-arranged escape route through the air vents.<br>  <br>  It's foolproof, I tell you.<br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  Oh young grasshopper, you have much to learn.  The absence of the cooeeing will serve to confuse anyone suspicious of our activity and have been monitoring/decoding our long-range methods of communication.  As the previous signal was cooeeing AND coughing, they would have associated the two together.  They will be on the alert for a cooee, while the real signal is just the coughing.  However the number, volume (70-82 dB), frequency (1589-1614 Hz), and length of the coughing will remain the same until further notice.<br>  Though if you insist upon having additional safety measures regarding our system of communication, I will be open to suggestions.|`|D571yzEcaa	Open it Very Very slowly lol i tried it.|`|cLhF7DM9aa	Ask librarian for scissors, I'm sure they'll lend you some for the sacred peace of the library.|`|UAf3R1Cgaa	LOL I wish i knew.....|`|a6j7Bu9daa	use scissors and cut the top off|`|4YnoykD2aa	Scissors, or pre-open, or go to the restroom.|`|I5cF2hXdaa	A pair of scissors to cut the packet. Or just open the packet slowly the normal way.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Wait for an airplane to pass overhead or a loud car to drive by the library. If that doesn't work, "accidentally" drop a few books to cause a distraction and open the M&Ms bag then.<br>  <br>  The next question is, How do I chew my M&Ms quietly in the library, right?|`|VVZF3QD5aa	rip em open dead quick<br>  <br>  Then its over and done with|`|QEQmMZycaa	Do it while coughing...coughing's allowed right?|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Have a tiny pair of scissors in your pocket to cut the corner off.

I would like to make it so children of today don't find it dated and so they can assoicate with it. I want to, at the same time, keep the charm and wonder of the original.|`|PCKNHjE2aa	I would remake "Pulp Fiction" .<br>  <br>  Its a great movie, non the less. But it could have been even better, I would leave the movie how it was, but expand it a bit. maybe add an additional hour and half to it.|`|7Y8Ek0Qsaa	Either Chicago, Bonnie and Clyde, or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

7609ac7e6e1d1a79b3957504fc7af390aa	I feel the same way. This country is a shambles. Everyday I turn on the news to hear about redundancies, people losing out on benefits and what not. My husband is in the health service and dont know how we are going to compensate for the 10% cut. Its hard enough to get by as it is. I cant find work for love or money. When will it end?|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	I agree they are just thieves, from the Jacky Smiths to the bank managers who take millions in bonuses and all at our expense, my advice would be if you cant beat them join them, anyone know of any good scams let the people know rob them bastards for a change, the law is dishonest from the police to the court System, when a Judge can turn and say this is immoral but we are in a court of law it's time to throw in the towel and start again with a new system

I wouldnt waste my time or breath to be honest.|`|S9tFYTdNaa	No. Its just a waste of time..|`|9TQrtSoiaa	dont know i think im pretty hard to argue with cos im really easy going|`|EoXeUgRIaa	Nah I just agree with them hun, secretly knowing I'm right!|`|AA10560773	If you are actually arguing with someone who is truly one sided, No it isn't worth it. he/she won't change their mind/opinion and you will have wasted your time.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	That is exactly what I am going through now with my youngest daughter.

Yes, he is your fiance but [again] It's what you think or refer him as. Honestly, It does matter what your boyfriend is referred as. I think you should call him what he is; YOUR FIANCE.

ebR3nOL1aa	Tarantino's latest film title really did cause some people to wonder whether the spelling is deliberately misspelled for purpose.<br>  <br>  According to the studio, they were originally going to call the name by its standard spelling. But it now seems that the new 'incorrect spelling' will the actual title of the film.<br>  <br>  A spokesman for the film's British publicists says, "We are not entirely sure the reasons why it has been changed. We think it just has to be one of those Tarantino-esque things. All we do know is that is definitely the title from now on.<br>  <br>  Tarantino is known for writing scripts with lots of misspellings, so maybe that's the way of separating himself from the 1978 "Inglorious Bastards" film.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Because someone already made a movie called "Inglorious Bastards."<br>  <br>  And because Tarantino really truly has grammar and spelling abilities about an 8th grade level so they just left it that way.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	we'll probably find out in the movie.<br>  <br>  it might have to do with the accent Brad Pitt's character has.<br>  he's got that southern touch to it, i don't know.<br>  <br>  i mean, it IS quentin tarantino.|`|0cpVDRJVaa	Because its Tarantino.

iXt3erseaa	There is a button on the outside of the bus that the bus driver uses to close the door behind him/her and lock it. That button also gets used the next day when the driver gets back in the bus. Look next time - typically to the left of the door as you are getting on the bus. There is a little hatch (like the one over a car's gas tank nozzle) and under that is the magic button...|`|cBxG0BbZaa	driver|`|SfUM9ZOcaa	The bus driver never leave. im prity sure they sleep there|`|SPvkz1kQaa	Lol, good question!

AA11605648	If your at the office...go to the rest room and take a 5 min nap after wards wash your neck with cold water. Who cares what they may think you are doing, you need that power shot. If that isn't feasible, then I would just take a walk around the office, couple quick laps around your floor, just be sure to have a good reason as to why you are walking so quick and what you are doing. <br>  <br>  If you are driving, you need to pull over and do a 10 min nap. Thats just going to keep everyone safe. After that roll down your windows and pump up the music, switch them back and forth so your brain doesn't get use to the sound.<br>  <br>  I just read your details, I would try really hard to hit the sack at 10 it will help. Don't drink any caffine past 7, and try to eat a small dinner it will all help.<br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|NlxIph98aa	Crank Up the AC – Warm, stuffy environments accelerate mental fatigue.  If you need to stay awake in a lecture hall or meeting room find an open seat under an AC vent.  <br>  <br>  Fasting at Mealtime – The human body expends a great deal of energy during the digestion process.  This can create a great deal of fatigue when you are trying to stay awake.  Fasting is a great way to avoid this natural fatigue.  As long as you are drinking enough water, fasting for a meal or two is also a healthy way to detoxify your cells and rejuvenate organs. <br>  <br>  Light Exercise Breaks – Take a break and take a walk or do a couple jumping jacks to get your blood moving.  Even the slightest bit of exercise can act as a healthy way to energize your mind and body. <br>  <br>  Chew Sugar-Free Peppermint Gum – It won’t rot your teeth and it will generate just enough physical activity to keep you awake.  Strong peppermint flavors seem to work best for me… there’s just something about that refreshing minty taste. <br>  <br>  Write – The idea is to keep your mind busy.  If you are attending a lecture or business meeting, write down everything that is said.  If you are simply trying to stay awake, create a detailed to-do list for the week or plan out your perfect weekend getaway. <br>  <br>  A Good Laugh – Watch a funny video clip or read your favorite comic strip.  A good chuckle will stimulate your mind and help you to stay awake a little while longer. <br>  <br>  Inspirational and Motivational Material – Sometimes all you need is a little pep talk.  Watch a video clip that inspires you. <br>  <br>  Music – If it’s not too much of a distraction, listening to fast beat music can be a great way to keep your mind awake. <br>  <br>  Tickle the Top of Your Mouth Cavity – Obviously, you’ll want to do this with your tongue.  Rub your tongue against the top front area of your mouth cavity.  It feels a little weird, but it does give you a quick, irritating nerve jolt that can actually help to keep you awake. <br>  <br>  Turn On All the Lights – Darkness promotes sleepiness.  Turn on every light in the room. <br>  <br>  Hangout with a Friend – It’s so much easier to stay awake when you have someone else to interact with. <br>  <br>  Play Video Games – First-person shooters, fast paced driving games, or online RPGs like the great World of Warcraft are sure to keep you wide awake. <br>  <br>  Go Outdoors – Getting some fresh air outdoors is always a good way to rouse your senses. <br>  <br>  Pull Down on Your Earlobes – This may sound strange, but pulling down on your earlobes can help you stay awake and alert when you’re feeling drowsy.  Just try it. <br>  <br>  Nutritious Low Carb Snacks – Low carb fruits such as raspberries, apples, oranges, and grapefruits are great energy boosters.  Heaping scoops of spicy salsa on a few small crackers is another goodie.  <br>  Stay away from meats, breads and dairy products. <br>  <br>  Get Enough Sleep When You Can – This one should be obvious.  The best way to stay awake is to be well rested.  If you get enough sleep on a regular basis it will be much easier for you to stay awake or pull an all-nighter when you absolutely must.|`|wkK5JDz4aa	you can just do something that is really funny,<br>  <br>  Go beat up some homeless people.|`|AA10778911	runnig|`|gQudMMTXaa	No Doze, it's great stuff!|`|CULqCWvXaa	dont turn the lights off or try to watch a movie. lol|`|ApwYfDYiaa	Sleep at night.<br>  and take a freezing cold or steaming hot shower.|`|8j70Neqeaa	keep moving.|`|e7c28740060350d2f181d79ca9b56dffaa	loud music..  ruining in place|`|UdwIaCxBaa	Exercise<br>  <br>  : )|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	B-12 vitamins|`|a1ymHaWAaa	exercise|`|CApnEZ83aa	Take a walk.|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	dont sit down-it helps you stay awake<br>  keep something really loud going-like really loud tv and really loud music|`|y7lUgd3aaa	-Keep yourself busy<br>  -Keep the air conditioner on/window open...heat makes you sleepy<br>  -Take a cold shower|`|yoytdRGTaa	Take a brisk walk on the wrong side of town in the middle of the night.|`|G0wGbdENaa	jog, get chased by wild goats erm i dunno, <br>  <br>  my way is to go outside for a fag but if your a non smokers try a lap round your garden|`|SH3wGEteaa	-good rest at night<br>  -eating right/ healthy diet|`|dae552a5de99943c8955067694525c9baa	other than better sleeping habits, get you heart rate up or cold compresses to your neck.|`|vpZJ6rZzaa	5 days back I drank red bull just for a taste...

iuWfp2fEaa	Yes, she should have been cited, especially after calling 911 three times for a non-emergency situation, but I don't understand why they wouldn't give her money back after being charged for something they were out of. That is something I would not tolerate.|`|AA12226501	Yes, she should be cited...it's an abuse of the emergency 911 system. She should have called a manager & worked out something regarding the money...she could have gotten a substitution or a store credit if they don't give refunds. The police should not have had to be involved in this at all...she deserves the citation, period.|`|9IvcV7tiaa	She shoulda called the NON emergency line, unless she was in the drive through, then it's perfectly understandable.|`|mggll8dRaa	She'll probably Sue and get $25000 for Discrimination.....!!|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	I think she should be cited for wasting the police's time. What is wrong with people these days? All she would have had to do was talk to the manager. 911 should only be used for emergency reason's. There are too many real problems out there like children being kidnapped, women being raped & etc. What happened to people dealing with one another face to face?|`|Lons8Pzyaa	yes she should have called 911 because they took it to another level n she did also. she did wut she had to do. money is like a passport n if a passport is lost or stolen den it is a bg problem. they probally would have never gave her money back if she jes left it alone. they could've done other peple like dat if she wouldnt have stepped up. it's her money n she deserves it. they cheated her!|`|M7W7lZBBaa	I think she should have to pay for the expense of the police coming out there, as well as be cited<br>  <br>  McDonald's (while it was rather stupid) was in the right, they have a no refund policy and offered to make it right with another item from the menu. They are protected. She is an idiot.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Being in the customer service business, I would think there is much of that lacking in any business anymore. Just refund her money, everyone's happy and McDonald's should blame their manager for being a complete jerkwad as well.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Give the lady the money back! Geez, Louise!

What the hell kind of business is that?  She paid for the nuggets so if the restaurant can't provide, then she should've got her money back.  She didn't paid to be told that they're out of chicken nuggets.  She shouldn't have called 911 but instead call the Better Business Bureau and make a formal complaint that McDonalds was robbing her.  I would've been rich if this had happened to me.  Whoever was in charge of that restaurant should get fired for trying to rip off a customer.  This incident is proof that problems between stupid people often don't get solve and creates problems for other people.|`|vD5ucs24aa	i agree no need to call 911 but i would have been pissed too they would have given me my money back or they would have had to call the cops on me. lol|`|DWgwjdTPaa	The woman was retarded.|`|0k439Yrcaa	that is crazy she shouldnt have called 911|`|AA11370204	She should be cited!!!!!!!!!|`|aLwrpMPXaa	My goodness !

Thats all he ever talks about.  His whole life is based upon having been to Vietnam.  He only listens to music that was out while he was in Vietnam.  He only reads books about the US Marines and/or Vietnam.  He tells the same stories, over and over, about his time in Vietnam.<br>  <br>  He is self centered, egotistical, childish.  He'll make inappropriate and rude remarks towards other people, but if someone does it to him, he gets VERY ANGRY, and wants to fight them.<br>  He'll tell my mother that her food is lousy, that she's a horrible cook, but if she DARES to say that what he cooked could have used less butter or more salt, he starts slamming dishes, stomping his feet, and screaming that everyone picks on him.<br>  If I'm visiting their house, and telling them about something important, he'll interupt me with his own story.  When my mother or I ask him why he's interrupting, he automatically starts screaming at us, that no one cares about him.<br>  He resents my brother and I.  After our births, our mother paid more attention to us than to my father, and he hates us for that.<br>  My father has always preached that there is nothing worse in the world than a liar.  Although my father lies more than anyone I know.<br>  If he sees someone smoking while driving, he gets "road rage" and follows them, honking his horn, making inappropriate gestures, swearing at them.  Same with people on cell phones.<br>  <br>  He's a child.  My father and I have NEVER had any sort of caring relationship, and I doubt we ever will.<br>  Through his immaturity, I'm attempting to be the adult, I've attempted over the last few years to make ammends with him, and it seems as though the older he gets, the less possibility there is of us having a REAL father/son relationship.<br>  <br>  He's 63 and I'm 30.|`|6k5fhFyBaa	My dad is an amazing person--nothing wrong with him, other than his high blood pressure.|`|SX9H2RWJaa	He died in 97   <br>  <br>  <br>  he had other children we didn't know about till yrs later after his death|`|lC5NLsZZaa	Other than a bad case of gas and a bad gall bladder...he's a bit of alright!|`|YdXhZka8aa	It took him 40 years to grow up.|`|8CUfDxRtaa	well...he died in Nov would probably be the first of the things wrong with him.

2C43Y9qJaa	Back in 2002,  I once sniped a target that was 1.15 miles or about 1.8 kilometers away. At that range you even have to consider the rotation of the Earth, not to mention the wind.

U5hxXYOQaa	I think we'd be far more advanced if it wasn't for religion.|`|WQvDIhmgaa	I think society as a whole would be better off if everyone was more accepting.  The color of an individuals skin is not the only issue, added to the list should be religion, sexual orientation, and political orientation etc.  If the more prominent members of our society were "accepting" then we see advancements that right now we can only dream of.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	we'll be colonizing the moon, or even set foot on Mars|`|u0ljcg7jaa	We would be living like The Jetsons...

AA12023256	It's all about the money.<br>  It says a lot about the human race. But really Paris is no worse than the photographer. She LOVES the attention. She thrives off of it. If not for those type of pics, she wouldn't be famous. She allows it, they do it, and people buy it. <br>  It's not for me personally, but there seems to be a huge market for that type of thing. Until people quit buying and wanting to see these types of things, it will remain. <br>  <br>  Society is in a severe state of moral decay. What was once "underground" is now mainstream. Good Q.<br>  <br>  Edit: I see what you are saying when you compare that to a drug dealer. You are right, the dealer should not be rewarded. But when there is a market for it, people often don't see from both sides. They see the drug addict and not the dealer. We know the addict is getting drugs from somewhere, but that becomes an after thought. Same as with the photographer. We know those pictures come from somewhere, and often Paris is the first to blame. But essentially, the photographer is to blame for taking the pic in the first place.

ODf41iN4aa	No, because I didn't go to kindergarten.  <br>  <br>  I remember a 2-wk summer recreation program the summer when I was 5 yrs old.  We took the school bus to the swimming pool, where we had swimming lessons in the morning & then came back to school for other activities.  All of this seemed dandy to me, & my older brother was there to look out for me.  (Well, sort of.  I shoud have been more skeptical about his help at times.)  <br>  <br>  The first day after we got back from swimming, my bro said to me, "Come on.  We're all going to the park to play baseball."  So, I ran down there with the boys to play ball.  The park was next door to the school, a little downhill.  When we got there, the adult male recreation teacher took one look at me & told me I was supposed to be back at the school where the girls were making hula skirts & learning the hula dance, so I had to run back all by myself.  We probably rode our bikes to school, too, & still had to ride back home afterward.  Kind of makes you tired just thinking about all this, doesn't it?   Then in late afternoon, Dad probably took us all swimming again so we could show off what we'd learned in our swimming lessons.  Whew! Join a gym, anybody? Just save your money & follow a kid around.  Sounds like training for a triathlon or something.<br>  <br>  The hula skirts were made out of chartreuse crepe paper by cutting fringe.  (I'm sure the young woman who was the recreation teacher did most of the work by sewing the crepe paper fringe onto strips of white sheeting for the waists.)  So, that turned out ok, but it was SO embarrassing, like the male teacher didn't think I knew that I was a girl.  The teachers probably laughed their heads off at the end of the day.  Oh, well.  It was fun anyway.  All I cared about was learning how to swim.  The rest was all fringe benefit.  (Fringe, get it?)<br>  <br>  The first day of first grade, the sweet little-old-lady teacher gave us paper to write our numbers in a column as far as we could.  When she walked around to check on us, she pointed out that I had written 01 instead of 10.  Tears rolled down my face.because I was afraid she would send me home.  (flunked out the first day!) Well, the sweet teacher let me stay, & everything worked out fine.  <br>  <br>  Oh! the other thing that happened on the first day was when we lined up after lunch to go back in, this boy George, whom I already knew because our families were friends, turned around in line & gave me a kiss right on the mouth.  That was really funny.  He got scolded instead of me, but they didn't expel him or send him to jail like the goofy news stories in this wacky age. (and no, I'm not belittling the idea of sexual harassment, but first grade is first grade, & we have lots of years 'til maybe 5th grade or something to teach kids about all that stuff.  Years later, I visited George & his wife.  He & I started laughing about the incident.  It was pretty funny for her to learn exactly what happened & that we were in first grade because she'd heard about me & thought  I was an ex-girlfriend.  Well, maybe I was,  but first grade isn't exactly college.<br>  <br>  Hope your memories are fun, too.  (These laughably tragic incidents are too much.)|`|04TD5L6Yaa	i do beacuse i got my pic taken in my FAVORITE dress...and my favorite activity was there...(you put a fishing pole over a curtain and you get a prize)...you got your pic taken because they made a it into a card...they put fabric on the card and whatever colors were on it decided what activities you got to play that day....i also had an amazing snack...after that day i rode my tricycle...those were the days!!! :D|`|53Bndus9aa	no i doo too well not preschool but i do remember kinddy ...i had moved countries and knew nothing ....from south america to australia...<br>  i knew no english....<br>  hahah the good ol days... well not really lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvMhARw7p63WvOFcvzw81tPg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304083400AALgbcC">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|FxwTtM8Faa	i never went to kindergarden, i just went straight to grade one..<br>  but i was in preschool for a while.|`|A15bfvkBaa	I remember that my mom dropped me there.. i was wearing my fav. t-shirt and i started crying like hell because i dropped juice on it haha..|`|KVzBqWhvaa	I do.

PIeronuZaa	Close but I don't agree..more like great minds think alike..hmmm ok, discussing ideas would be a common trait among great minds, ok...now take average minds,.they usually are too busy trying to make ends meet, raise families, etc. therefore not really much time to discuss current events, and the events that do pop up would more than likely be things that are not controversial in concepts, thus most average minded people, if not all, would definitely not comprehend paradigms let alone proceed to exercise the mental images thus produced...small minds in general are too feeble-minded in general, either from birth or from being underprivileged, or perhaps neglect on their part during stages of development as a human beings, therefore the top priority of the small minded would be only survival~|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Nope !!<br>  Not always !!~<br>  Many a times, small minds discuss events & ideas too ..... albeit the evil ones !!~?|`|5rraSJRVaa	Cool, I've a little bit of everything :)|`|1tLmTjBxaa	dont these people combine all the 3..and compensate each other and hence stand neutral|`|AA11656797	I've never heard that one before...

This is a large round scar on my shoulder from a vaccination that I got many years ago. The funny stuff is that I used to tell people when they asked me what it was that I got shot in the shoulder during the revolution. Without asking me what revolution or any other questions they just believed it and gave me wide eyes and they were shocked that I had experienced something like a gun shot in my early teens. It was fun. Over time it faded a lot and got a bit smaller so I can't really tell them the revolution story anymore.|`|nDSLNnguaa	Scars on my leg from shaving (slow learner)<br>  roof of my mouth from chicken pox <br>  two tiny ones on my stomach from gallbladder removal <br>  <br>  Mostly I just wanted to say thumbs up to Don't Hate^^^^!

So i stopped studying|`|AA10778911	me|`|64c705e332ca73b5ae16bb7956f90becaa	yup, I did.|`|cyt7oh97aa	I had a college professor who taught one of my drawing classes and he would never come to class with his own equipment.  He would just show up with a grade book and a diet coke.  Since he didn't bring a sketch pad and charcoal like every other drawing teacher did, he would instead draw on other people's work when doing a demo for us.  And he would usually  use mine.  I HATED that!  And 90% of the time I didn't need any help fixing mine and sometimes he would ruin my drawing trying to show an example of what other people need to do.  <br>  One time we were doing ink wash, and with ink wash to make things darker you layer on the ink water.  So I was one of the first people to start on my ink wash because I had everything else drawn out, and then he stops the class to show them how to do it (it's was second level so we all knew how to do it) and he started on what was going to be a very light area and instead of doing one layer, which is all it needed he did two layers, so my drawing was off, and the he erased a part of another section that i had already inked just to show that you can erase ink wash, but not very well.  So now my drawing was going to be off there as well.  <br>  He also would give us assignments and expect us to put 5 to 10 hours of work into them, but I was just a fast drawer and would get mine done in 3, and even though he told the class that he can tell what is 3 hours and what is 10 hours, he could never tell with mine and I would always get an A.  <br>  I ended up getting a D in the class because of attendance, which really sucks because all my assignments were A's.  But I will never take a class with him ever again.  He was a great guy, just a god awful teacher.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	Yes. I has a teacher who would talk to us about sex and drugs. She talked to us like we were at an equal level and not students. I would always tell my mom. Well one day (without me knowing) my mom told on her. After that she called me a stupid idiot (in front of the whole class) and treated me mean. Good luck with this teacher.|`|bb0487e3f4e58641a40d9c9b91ae1826aa	I had a teacher who always brought the conversation around to sex and her incontinent dogs.  She then had the nerve to tell me her class was more sophisticated than I was used to when I told her I didn't understand one of the assignments.<br>  This was a university professor.  I don't think she's sophisticated enough to be teaching in a university.

She has a light and breezy personality, but her future has become a bit clouded because of a contract dispute. She just needs to reign in her emotions and avoid violent outbursts.

bn7KciIeaa	I onced asked my friend "If you were a goat, would you hide your turkey in an open field?".  She answered "No, it would be to hard to find.  I'd hide it in a lagoon."  All of a sudden, Bob the PieMaster comes runnig out screaming "SASSAFRASS!!! SASSAFRASS!! BEWARE OF THE JINGLE CAGE SASSAFRASS!!!"  Bob is awfully stupid, so we just put on our chocolate earmuffs and head for NeverLand.  Half-way there, El Chupacabra jumps out of a blueberry orange grove with a bottle of ketchup.  I pull out a bottle of mustard from my portable Mazda Miata and hand it to him.  He stares at it, then pours them both on my friend and eats her.  I continue to walk to NeverLand.  I can just see the outline of Darth Vader's flying pony when out of nowhere, a giant cube-shaped eskimo plummets out of the sky and falls on me.  I die.  El Chupacabra laughs, and Bob pops out of his magic space portal, waves his fist in the air, and says "I TOLD YOU TO BEWARE OF THE SASSAFRASS!!!"<br>  <br>  the end|`|G0wGbdENaa	sassafrass, goat, turkey, chupacabra, lagoon, and mustard<br>  <br>  once upon a time a goat was chillin wit his rent a bride turkey in the lagoon while eating mustard, <br>  <br>  then they realised they didnt like mustard and shouted out sassafrass!!!!<br>  <br>  and chubaaca came along and killed everyone on his three wheeled lawnmower|`|y7lUgd3aaa	There was was a goat named GG.  He was happily married to a turkey named Tanya.  All of their neighbors saw them as circus freaks because they married out of their species.  This is how they met....<br>  Long, long ago amongst the sassafrass there lived a goat.  He slept under the sassafrass to try and be camoflauged from the cats who tried to eat him.  He was so scared to leave his home in fear of his life that he was starving.  Really fast, GG bolted towards the lagoon to get a quick drink.  All of a sudden he heard a noise "Gobble, Gobble".  "Oh no!  Not a chupacabra....Im too young to die"  He seized a sign of relief when he saw it was only a lonely turkey.  The little turkey was crying becuase she had no food.  The goat threw the lady on to his back and ran to the hot dog stand.  GG butted the owner in the butt with his horn and stole the mustard and a few hot dogs.  The two had a nice lunch and lived happily ever after.  THE END|`|Awv7stIJaa	Once upon a time, a turkey named sassafrass toddled it's graceful body over to the lagoon, which was filled with mustard.

In my little area of the lagoon I have a goat farm. Recently my goats had began to disappear. When I was out walking on the beach, I found 4 carcasses of my goats. <br>  <br>  The island gets its name from the legend of the Chupacabra, a mix between a demon, a dog, and a big cat. I have never really believed in it until I found my goats. <br>  <br>  Upon realizing that this may be what killing my lively hood. I went to visit our island's old wives teller. Ms. Lilly Sassafrass, she seems to be crazy because she named herself, and has a pet turkey named Mustard. Now Ms. Sassafrass says that we have to catch this chupacabra, or it will take all of our animals. So I was onboard with this idea until she said I would be the bait. I know I said that I didn't believe in this creature, but I didn't want to take any chances. I begged Ms. Sassafrass not to set me up, but it didn't work.<br>  <br>  She took me and her turkey, Mustard, down to the edge of the lagoon. She put a ring of sassafrass branches ( thats where she got her name) around us and lit them on fire. The smell was unique almost fragrant, until she poured goats blood on it and it turned to this offensive smell. She said ok darling now when the chupacabra comes along throw out Mustard, it will chase him, and then you catch the creature. <br>  <br>  Ok here we were, me and Mustard, sitting, waiting, on this unknowingly crazy creature. Then all of a sudden i heard something, and it got closer and closer, until I got so nervous I threw out Mustard and watched to see what happened. Nothing...Mustard just stood there, scratching in the sand. I waited the entire night, until I feel asleep inside my bloody burning sassafrass cirlce. The next morning I awoke to Mustard pecking at my hands. I stood up and noticed these hugh footprints all around the ring, the were so big my foot couldn't fit inside. <br>  <br>  I took Mustard and went back to Ms. Sassafrass', she said well my dear, it looks as if though he came and went in the night. He went without taking your goats. The sassafrass worked. I looked at her in confusion. She says, you see the legend says if one burns the blood of the chupacabra's victim with a sassafrass branch, he will leave and not return.<br>  <br>  That week was the last time I lost anymore goats. I still have nightmares about that night, dreaming I was there asleep, never heard it at all, and the whole time it stood there watching me. If you ever find your self on the island Chupacabra, down by the lagoon, be sure to have a sassafrass branch to ward off the Chupacabra.|`|9lGHSvLaaa	One day i was eating a turkey sandwich with some mustard under a sassafrass tree and i saw a goat get attacked by a chupacarbra it freaked me out so i threw my sandwich at its eye and it fell into a lagoon.|`|GM8xyco0aa	Hey this one time, i ate some sassafrass, and it made me poop out a goat, which gave birth to a turkey! and the turkey bit me and flew away with me hanging on! then the mutha phuckin thing dropped me in a lagoon of mustard!! i was so disgusted that i pooped again! then i threw up!! but it was all a dream and i actually shat all over myself in bed oh well THE END. =D|`|frwlypDWaa	A goat, a turkey, and a chupacabra walked into a bar next to the lagoon. The goat ordered a sassafrass. The turkey ordered a hot pretzel with mustard on it. The chupacabra ate the goat and the turkey.<br>  <br>  The bartender said, "What is this? Some kind of joke?"|`|1SKN7SoDaa	One day, after watching a very funny movie at their local cinema, Cupacabra and Sassafrass went quickly to Tesco's and bought a fresh goat, a live turkey, and creamy mustard. They had decided the night before that today, they would go for a lovely picnic beside the lagoon in the nearby park.<br>  "Aaaaah, what a fine day, and a perfect one for a picnic." Pronounced Cupacabra, breathing deeply.<br>  "Yes you sure are right Cupacabra." Sassafrass quickly replied.<br>  <br>  Soon, they both had unpacked their red, checkered woven basket and begun setting the meal out. Without wasting time, they gently spread the mustard onto both the goat and turkey, and tucked into their delicious spread.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Haha, what a completly, weird story, but it's just what you wanted.... ;)|`|4WCLWhaTaa	There once was a person who asked for random stories about sassafras, goat, turkey, chupacabra, lagoon and mustard. Said person decided that the net was the best way to indulge in this strange attraction to these articles. <br>  She was laughed at over and over again until it was pointed out to her what the word "random" means...<br>  Realizing her error in that random by its very nature has no definitive objective and is not bound by guidelines she laughed at herself a little and ceased her silly quest. <br>  The End.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	i climbed a sassafrass to escape a rabid goat - but a turkey pecked my hands until i couldnt hold anymore.<br>  ?<br>  I fell out of the tree, into the lagoon and swam to the far shore where a chupacabra came after me (as he couldnt reach the rabid goat)  fortunately I scared him off with some mustard spray (as it is common knowledge that chupacabras are allergic to mustard)|`|105Ti39vaa	Sassafrass and Chupacbra went to the lagoon cook off were they ate turkey with mustard and saw a goat. :)

Maybe she thinks she can get away with it. Know anything about behavior modification? If you've ever wanted children, dealing with your sister's bad behavior is an excellent opportunity for you. :o)<br>  <br>  Typically there are 4 reasons for inappropriate behavior (according to Dreikurs):<br>  <br>      * Attention<br>      * Revenge<br>      * Power<br>      * Display of Inadequacy<br>  <br>  Attention: When a child can't get your attention, they'll often act out to get it.<br>  <br>  Revenge A child doesn't feel loved for some reason and seeks revenge for attention, they feel important when they hurt others or hurt the feelings of others.<br>  <br>  Power These children need to be the 'boss'. They only feel important when they are the boss. Power struggles become numerous in these situations.<br>  <br>  Display of Inadequacy These children usually have low confidence and self-esteem levels and will give up quickly thinking they can't do anything. They don't often have a sense of doing something successful.<br>  <a href="http://specialed.about.com/od/behavioremotional/a/behavsupport.htm" rel="nofollow">http://specialed.about.com/od/behaviorem...</a><br>  <br>  You could try an operant conditioning approach.<br>  <a href="http://www.wagntrain.com/OC/#Operant" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagntrain.com/OC/#Operant</a>|`|1SKN7SoDaa	Phone your parents, get them to talk to your sis, then order her to do something she really really hates.

zpGccg1caa	For me, the only thing I'm picky about is attitude and personality. Weight, hair, and clothes change with time. I will fall in love with a girl's attitude and personality, not her hair color. Honestly, stop trying to be perfect for guys. We will notice you, don't worry!|`|AA11072975	These are not hard fast rules, but I like a woman with some meat on her bones. Nothing extreme, but just a nice round shape, though I have dated very slim girls too. <br>  <br>  I could NOT fall for an airhead, no matter how hot she was. I require mental stimulation from my partner just as much as sexual. <br>  <br>  No strong preference as to hair color, but do prefer it medium length to long. <br>  <br>  In clothing, my preference would be a mix. Mainly, I just prefer her to be neat and clean in her clothes.<br>  <br>  I'm 6'4" and prefer girls to be of at least medium height, though I have dated girls who were short. <br>  <br>  Again, these are just some guidelines applying to me.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	It's not so much the weight that matters as the woman's shape.<br>  <br>  I can love a 200-pound-woman if she has really big t i t s and/or very nice-looking <br>  a s s.  But if the 200-pound-woman looks shapeless and obese.  Then love her I cannot.<br>  <br>  And the same is true for thin women too.  Some thin women have enough flesh in the right places to make them look attractive.  And in the end, it's the shape of her body that's important and not her weight.|`|ug3kR8u3aa	my gf was 5'5. and 130 <br>  she had blonde<br>  and she uses both types of clothing<br>  and she had long hair<br>  and she in the middle of dumb and smart.|`|Yl4EWJh1aa	I dont think weight matters too much for most guys as long as ther girls have huge boobs nice *** and nice putang|`|U8WJieKHaa	less than 130<br>  redhead<br>  conservative....but a bit revealing as well<br>  short<br>  smart|`|YBQHAbOIaa	sexy,smart redhead.<br>  the rest does't matter|`|af1fe9ebe396bd1dc330674aa3329c96aa	Big ones.|`|AA11288692	No one wants to hug a stick.<br>  Everything else doesn't matter.|`|IEfCXboUaa	<129.75<br>  black hair<br>  sexy<br>  long<br>  airhead|`|AA10626566	I prefer not to limit myself and indulge in what is before me at the moment.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	REDHEADS WEIGHING OVER 300 POUNDS AND WHO SMOKE METH|`|PseiMJd2aa	Why all the other questions?

I'm smart!!! <br>  <br>  It really ALL depends on the man! Really! Do you like ANY kind of man or are you drawn to only certain types? My fiance happens to think most women under TWO HUNDRED pounds look too thin for him. But there are men that prefer women who are much slimmer. It's just a matter of taste.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	red heads, long hair, 130 and nothing less trump over everything<br>  <br>  5'4" is pretty short. im talking 5 6 <br>  <br>  i like my women a little taller. nice arms fit.<br>  <br>  its about how you look not how you weight. my friend probably weighs 130 but shes out of shape.<br>  <br>  i like fit women in shape who take care of themselve and their hair.|`|RnwrEcY5aa	^^^^ what he said^^^^<br>  <br>  But I do like to see a woman in a dress on occasion. <br>  A woman's weight should not really be an issue. But when when bulk starts overwhelming her basic shape, then it becomes a matter of how great the  personality is. <br>  <br>  Hey guys, your not off the hook either.|`|T9HOvdjtaa	Don't you understand that the models in magazines are for women to look at, not men?<br>  <br>  That's why they are in women's magazines.

CfWXgwxBaa	lol! Good one Andrea!Nice avatar by the way!|`|4YnoykD2aa	Did Noah have a second human on board? Maybe he couldn't leave the helm to do so.|`|JsffWlnEaa	stupidity...|`|EmvOyF0zaa	he's not paying for attention|`|wNvXxRppaa	Because in 654 BC, mosquitoes were used to prevent people from saying "orrraaggg". If any person was caught saying "orrraaggg" would be caught by the Romans and sent to suffer torture.<br>  <br>  When the rivers came, all wild life that Noah forgot was removed from the planet, such as the Elephant that always has coins on his skin, A cat that always gives you a man/woman of your most desires and a beaver that prevents global warning.<br>  <br>  God, who was eating a slice of Domino's pizza he stole from 2010 in the future, noticed that Noah had forgot the mosquitoes and was afraid that people would start shouting "orrraaggg" which was a bigger sin than even honouring the devil.<br>  <br>  He demanded to Noah that he freed the mosquitoes or else all the world would be blown up by the Big Bang. Noah who studied planets, toilets and finigan was scared and freed the mosquitoes from the planet.<br>  <br>  He took two mosquitoes, Brenda and Pancake, and took then on the Ark, but on the way there, he tripped over a rock, and fell to the ground, so he squished the mosquitoes. He then had to get two more mosquitoes, called Brian and Buzz, and put them under the arm, to get them out of the rain.|`|TBPY8g6yaa	cos back then mosquitoes were well mannered and civilised, oh, and humans were too stupid.  the thing is, the mosquitoes only started attacking us because Noah's son's son's dog's dentist farted and killed the great, great, great, great grandson of the sister twice removed of the foot cleaner of the son of the first mosquito, Ezekiel.   This started a never-ending war.  Although we have size and strength, mosquitoes are fast, agile and annoyingle itchy.  So join together today.  UNITE! for freedom, for itch relief, for free chips!  and wipe the mosquitoes from the face of the earth.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and mars, too|`|CU3hW5iRaa	i thought that question said why did noah swat those two mosquitoes<br>  <br>  andrea<br>  <br>  as in you were dropping the question for andea<br>  <br>  then i realized it was your name.  it was still a pretty moment|`|VP8fmmFraa	because those little suckers(pun intended) move fast<br>  <br>  kisss beautiful|`|StqesccHaa	tell you what, anytime u need some mosquitoes swatting just call me jejejejeje<br>  <br>  <br>  besote Bonita!|`|cGb3jlmNaa	because noah thought that they were going to help move the elephants faster, hee jokes on us lol<br>  <br>  besitos amiga|`|OqmaGurSaa	****|`|XlhBBZPxaa	just think about what mosquitoes do for us though?|`|aheCPEa6aa	God told noah that he had to have two of everything<br>  noah only follow orders|`|Iwwr4NJvaa	he tried but by then it was to late because the mosquitoes where already in the ark and the doors were close|`|HXjvJDDxaa	lol<br>  <br>  just  here to say hi beautiful|`|QiwIIvOcaa	he probably tried, but they were too quick. or maybe they were hiding|`|abx5VNsOaa	How did the Ark not get eaten by the white ants or termites!!|`|C0i3t4graa	good question.got no good answer.

m4PtEEDNaa	...easily, the most prominent scene in 1931's "Frankenstein", which exudes the monster's childlike innocence, is the scene where he encounters the little girl, Maria, by the lake/river, who is tossing flowers into the water, and watching them float.  As the monster engages the same playful activity, he becomes overwhelmingly elated at the fact that something so beautiful could calmly float like that.  When he abruptly runs out of flowers to toss in the water, he looks over at Maria in wanting, and smiles, thinking that if the flowers floated so calmly and beautifully, then so would the beautiful little girl.  Of course, at this point, the monster picks up the little girl, and tosses her into the water, as effortlessly as he did the flowers.  As the little girl thrashes, struggles, screams, and ultimately drowns in the water, the monster quickly and shamefully leaves the scene, not clearly realizing what he has done, but definitely knowing that something was wrong with what he did...

It's derogatory and shows massive disrespect.|`|AA11865684	You can't express an emotion thru texting,so how would she know you were joking?I'd be offended too and my azz isn't uptight,its relaxed.<br>  <br>  =)|`|zqOnNF2Gaa	Well I am not partial to the word B*tch.

No, I would not be offended at all. I know your sense of humor and it LOVE it!|`|8MZuVAKiaa	No! LOL! I'd laugh if you said that... one of my 'nicknames' given to me by my brother is "Sarcastic B*tch"... I laugh every time he says it...<br>  It's hysterical.<br>  I don't get what her problem was!|`|i15KoiJhaa	Nah wouldn't offend me at all.<br>  <br>  Beeyatch!<br>  <br>  See, don't we all feel better now!?|`|9it5nGJjaa	Nope I wouldn't get offended.

If you're friends, she should KNOW that you're joking!  Obviously you are joking if you wrote ****** anyway!  And who the hell cares!  Plus if she just said you can always make her laugh, then she should know ur joking.  If she's seriously mad about this (and she's not joking herself), then it sounds liek she is a ******!<br>  <br>  I hate people that can't take a joke either!!!|`|pClSy09Daa	uhm wow. <br>  she's crazy!<br>  and no way would it offend me, i find it hilarious. <br>  <br>  you seem like a very fun person to talk to. <br>  she didn't have to over react to your comment. <br>  <br>  just keep being funny and don't let females like her get in your way. :)|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	She is a beeyatch. <br>  <br>  But no, that should not be offensive, especially since you didn't actually say "B*TCH"  Oh well, women are loons...|`|eVEUOGF4aa	I'd laugh along with you! Great humor :) x|`|VFBN2YVvaa	no u should apologize, i would be offended i would prolly say back in return lol. Ur friend is crazy.|`|13b0ee2df2675456a4d60accfb6c703faa	It wouldn't offend me at all.....|`|Xka2R4EJaa	No one because you are obviously kidding! if you spelled it the real way then i can see why it would offend her. That's dumb tho I wouldn't kiss her a** either! =)|`|AA11569882	Well, it is an odd thing to say... she was sending you a compliment (rather flirty too) and you go and take the mick out of her and end it with 'beeyatch'!  It's different when it's to peoples faces, because they can see that you're smiling and that you mean no offence, but you have to be careful when you are messaging people.  <br>  <br>  Do say sorry next time you see her, just say that things were taken out of context, you didn't mean for them to sound like that, etc.  Just be nice!|`|mSt1LGfjaa	your right,,we all know you by now and know you didn't mean to say it but in a kidding way..hell everybody says that ,,i wouldn't worry about,,we love you,,|`|T864ejaiaa	yes. there s no reason for names like that.|`|abx5VNsOaa	If she is not from your country,good chance you did offend her,i offended one of my awesome USA contacts,i'm still scratching my head over that!!<br>  Even though we may speak the same lingo,some things don't translate well online.<br>  You may have to eat humble pie if you want to maintain your contacts friendship,but you would not offend me.|`|y1vrMUCYaa	Naw it wouldn't offend me, but maybe she really was having a bad day..we all get them. Otherwise she should lighten up if she knows you well enough to know your humor.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	That wouldn't offend me. She just has her titties in a twist for some reason.|`|CtUVT49Gaa	You beach...|`|GeyFdO5jaa	You don't need someone in your life like that hun.. u need laughter and smiles   don't kiss her a**|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	It takes a lot to offend me and that wouldn't offend me at all.  If she knows you well and knows that is how you are then she shouldn't be offended but maybe you don't know her as well as you thought you did because you would have known that calling her a b*tch would offend her :-)|`|14sTjIZ7aa	The point is that she is your online friend, and you offended her.  If you didn't want to hurt her feelings, then say, "I'm sorry, I didn't intend to hurt your feelings.  Your not at all a B*****."<br>  <br>  Why be so stubborn about it?  It's not kissing butt when your making up for hurting someones feelings.  Everybody has things that set them off, relax.  It sounds like maybe your taking things a bit too personally yourself.|`|4WszPA0Paa	Bipolar much? same thing happened to me but i managed to fix it - sure it was a random comment, but thats a good thing most of the time<br>  the fact that she is offended is retarded but you shouldnt stay on bad terms... just explain what ur intention of the joke was and you werent calling her a *****.. she just misunderstood<br>  <br>  she should forgive you when you tell her... if she doesnt thats kinda messed up cuz u'z straight up hilarious<br>  <br>  no reason to turn a lil thing into a big fight so just suck up ur pride and she should do the same<br>  really think about how little this is.... it's ok to be pissed but being mature is always a good fix|`|NKuQh4sSaa	Nah it wouldn't offend me at all .

XONUN5H2aa	Secondary progressions are a prediction technique or part of a larger prediction method.  Let's say you want to see if there are any major events coming up at age 25.  If you have a computer program that does the calculations, just put in the information or date you want the chart progressed to.  If you want to do it yourself, get an ephemeris and count 25 days from the day you were born, and then cast the chart for the same time of day and same place as you were born.  The result is a progressed chart. <br>  <br>  Let's say on your birthday The Sun was about 25 degrees from the midheaven.  Then at about age 25, the progressed Sun would be conjunct the midheaven.  That would indicate perhaps awards at work or a promotion or a good time to begin a business.  That's an oversimplification, but you get the idea.<br>  <br>  Perhaps at age 27 the progressed Moon is trine the ruler of the natal 7th house.  That would indicate marriage. Progressions are supposed to show the gradual unfolding of the life.  Like every other predictive technique, this one is not foolproof.<br>  <br>  The examples I've given are broad brush stuff and a better way to use these is with solar and lunar returns, but that would require a book to explain in depth.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
m82mu7eKaa	Dear G girl,<br>  Scientology is "knowing how to know," or "knowing in the fullest sense of the word." It is the largest coordinated body of knowledge concerning the human spirit. It is an applied religious philosophy. As a subject, Scientology is pretty vast, but then the human spirit itself is a vast subject. You can get a lot of data from the official website or the one below.<br>  <br>  Mrs. Holmes is recently reported to be doing a detox program called the "Purification Rundown." This is not a diet, as there are no rules of what to eat while on the program beyond being sensible (like don't eat vegetables that are cooked to death). And it's not even a medical program. Scientologists do it to rid the body of accumulated toxins (preservatives, herbicides, pollution, drugs, etc., etc., etc.) that eventually build up in our bodies in this biochemical society and result in unpleasant effects. Dullness, fatigue, lost "zip." Not dramatic enough (like broken bones and shrieking inflammations) to interest your medical doctor. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the program is basically a combination of exercise, sauna and some carefully formulated nutrients that have the effect of getting old poisons out. What's amazing about it is that you can feel and often see these things coming out of your body.|`|t6k3yoNdaa	This is what me father told me, they believe their God lives in a space ship. Reason for the "scient" the beginning letters, basically focused on science and weird things!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scientology.org/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientology.org/home.html</a>
lpyWVR2oaa	This is just based on the Sun and Moon sign traits in your personality.<br>  <br>  You are essentially someone who thrives on communication and social interaction. Intellectual stimulation and having a sense of curiosity in all around you is important to you and you're highly versatile albeit, fickle-minded and restless at times. When it comes to emotions and feelings, you are actually more in touch with them than the typical Gemini although you tend not to show your feelings too much (unless u have a watery ascendant). <br>  <br>  This combo could throw you off guard many times where feelings are concerned because Gemini is essentially a detached air sign while Cancer wants to cling and find emotional security and nurturance. In time, if you are able to integrate both aspects of yourself, you'll find that you have the best of both worlds indeed.|`|AA11946996	Would need your B-date in order to answer and time to be more accurate.|`|Nx0kNuO4aa	You'll probably need to include dob, if you know time to get a really good reading.
t6k3yoNdaa	In John Wayne's own words, "There've been a lot of stories about how I got to be called Duke. One was that I played the part of a duke in a school play, which I never did. Sometimes, they even said I was descended from royalty! It was all a lot of rubbish. Hell, the truth is that I was named after a dog!" <br>  <br>  John Wayne was born Marion Michael Morrison in Winterset, Iowa. When young Marion was six, the family moved to California, eventually settling in Glendale. Marion delivered newspapers in the morning with his trusty Airedale, Duke. The locale firemen called them "Big Duke" and "Little Duke." <br>  <br>  Marion later accepted a full scholarship to play football at the University of Southern California. In the summer of 1926, head coach Howard Jones fixed Duke up with a job as an assistant prop man on the set of a John Ford movie. The rest is history.

8fvBN4kxaa	they help the film run|`|aeb8a97e18cfb4ff7d90a5aa9ca2331faa	You have nailed it on the head, it's all about promotion of the film to get people so excited to see the movie when it comes out.  The old school way is to create a poster to hang in the lobby of the movie theaters so that the theaters can prominently display what is coming soon, as well as what they are currently playing.  They spend a lot of time on the posters because they want to attract potential clients to their poster.  I know I find myself after a film, if I go with someone else, looking at the posters of the soon to be released movies and getting an idea of who the director is going to be and actors in particular films that interest me.<br>  <br>  The Trailers are the real lure once you find out about a movie that you would like to see.  The poster art will tell you about upcoming films and then you'll either go to the website or a favorite trailer site to look up the movie clips to see if it will interest you further.  Actually a lot of times the trailer is better than the actual feature.  Some trailers actually cost as much as the movies that they are representing, that's rare but it has happened.  This helps to drive people into a frenzy to get them really excited to see the picture.<br>  <br>  Within the last 10 years the website has also become a major lure with behind the scenes footage, blogs, forums etc that will get fans to talk about the film.  Usually you can find different versions of the trailer there for the people that have to get as many previews of the new feature as they can.  They will also include games to continue driving traffic to the site after the movie is out.<br>  <br>  It's all about packaging the film so that more people will go out and see it on the opening weekend.  All of it is strategically used to hype up the movie.|`|o7BWcgEFaa	Great advertising tools...look they even have you asking about them...it is all about generating public interest in an up coming film product.|`|3Dp5mEMqaa	To advertise whatever the company is trying to sell.

Here is all I could find Sorry.<br>  <br>  B.J. is a 7 year old yellow protoceratops and he has been on the show since season 2. His theme song is "B.J.'s Song". He wears a red baseball cap on his head and red sneakers on his feet (as heard in the lyrics of his theme). He has lost his hat in the episode Hats Off to B.J.! and sometimes says stuff to hide fears (like in Barney's Halloween Party, he was shocked by the paper spiders and after learning they were fake, he said "I knew that, sort of."). Pickles are his favorite food and because of that, he actually has had them in different ways like pickles (also with pepperoni, peppers, pineapple and peanut butter) on a pizza (in Barney's Adventure Bus).|`|AA12130640	I thought she was saying DJ?
AA10562006	OK i will tell you what each of the different aspects mean:<br>  <br>  <br>  -Capricorn Rising:<br>  There's a seriousness to Capricorn rising people that is unmistakable. Even when they're joking around, it's of the deadpan variety. In fact, plenty of very humorous people have Capricorn Ascendants. It's all in the timing...and the fact that they don't giggle before the joke is over. <br>  <br>  Capricorn Ascendant people project competence. They simply ooze it. They're generally very image-conscious people—the clothes they wear and their manner are a big deal to them. They want to appear successful, and they generally succeed! <br>  <br>  Often the Ascendant persona is the one that was forced upon us by family conditioning. For example, parents may label their Libra Ascendant child the "nice" one; their Aries Ascendant child the "independent" one; and their Pisces Ascendant child is generally the space cadet of the family. We adopt these roles as familiar ones, and often carry them with us as our defense mechanisms, in some way or another, for the rest of our lives. In the case of Capricorn Ascendants, these were the children who were considered the responsible ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Sun in Capricorn:<br>  <br>  Capricorn is a feet-on-the-ground, eye-on-the-prize sign. Those with Sun in Capricorn have a realistic, grounded approach to life that can be seen no matter how dreamy the rest of the birth chart suggests. These people know how to do things, and to get things done. <br>  <br>  Some Capricorns naturally turn their backs on things they deem too frivolous. They are very much concerned with things that are worthwhile—and that includes their own lives. Capricorns want to do and be something worthwhile. Like their Earth signs relatives, Taurus and Virgo, they need to feel useful and effective in the real world in order to be satisfied with their lives. But the Capricorn spin on the earth signs is that Capricorn possesses a stronger need for recognition in a worldly sense. They have a strong sense of society and its framework, and they feel most secure when they feel they are doing their part within that framework.  <br>  <br>  -Moon in Leo:<br>  <br>  Moon in Leo people are not necessarily outgoing. When they feel comfortable, they do like being the center of attention. That is, they like being in the "spotlight" in the comfort of their own homes and with family and friends. They enjoy entertaining others, and often take on the role of comic. <br>  <br>  Lunar Leos often feel a need to organize, and even control, their families and friends. They have an inner mission to set things right, and generally like to oversee the goings-on in their little circle. <br>  <br>  This is a rather creative position of the Moon. At the very least, Moon in Leo people want to create and entertain. They can be rather lazy at times, and a little bossy too. Generally, though, they have a deep need to treat others fairly and justly.<br>  <br>  -Venus in Sagittarius:<br>  <br>  When Venus in Sagittarius people are in love, they need to feel they can grow and expand their horizons through their relationship. They want to learn new things, and experience everything together. These are idealistic lovers who want you to appreciate their beliefs, visions, and ideals. They can be a confusing mix of the lighthearted and serious. They are roamers and seekers, and don't commit in their relationships as easily as others. <br>  <br>  Venus in Sagittarius men and women turn others on with their big smiles and laughs, their jokes, their grand schemes, their dreams, and their friendly, flirtatious behavior. They pride themselves on their open minds, but you may notice they can be judgmental too. They are threatened by inhibitions on the part of their lover, dullness, and emotional overkill. They are restless, and won't put up with lovers who dwell on any one thing. When the going gets tough in their relationship, they have an overwhelming need to run away. Usually this only means getting out and experiencing something new before they come back, but sometimes it can be for good. They are attracted to people in love with life. You don't need to be refined, polished, or graceful to win their favor. <br>  <br>  <br>  -Mars in Aries:<br>  <br>  This is a very impulsive position of Mars. The first instinct for Mars in Aries natives is to  take action. Quick flare-ups characterize the Mars in Aries character, but their anger usually doesn't last for too long. In fact, these people generally don't live in the past, and are not given to holding grudges or feeling resentful. Generally, their temper comes quickly, and they deal with anger on issues right away—with this kind of character, there is little room for festering.<br>  <br>  When Mars in Aries people listen to their instincts, they generally get things done, and they make fast and (usually) decent decisions. They don't naturally stop to smell the roses—or consider others' point of view—when they are deliberating over what to do next. In fact, "deliberation" works at lightning speed for these natives, so they could hardly be called d

That's what made him stand out from the beginning.  He showed a genuine interest in me, and learning about my life.

SMBRn9KJaa	LilyRT hit it on the nose when she listed 12 angry men.  I am sure she meant the Original.  Fantastic movie.  Demonstrates how difficult it can be to stand up to a strong will that sways others in the crowd against you.<br>  <br>  Side note:  Horton hears a who.  Childish indeed.  The main character stands against all the people he knows to do the right thing while everyone thinks him to be the fool.  Most children's stories deal with moral courage.  So if this is for a class project I would suggest looking a those movies.  They are the source what we as adults believe to be the 'right' way to act and interact with the world around us.   They are meant to teach children examples and ingrain within them what we as a society value.  That is the basis for most children's cartoons.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	pay it forward. where if you help 2 people out, they will help 2 people out, and those 4 people would help 2 people, so on and so forth|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Amistad<br>  Babe<br>  The Insider<br>  Conrack<br>  Gorillas In The Mist<br>  The Mission<br>  Never Cry Wolf<br>  It's A Wonderful Life<br>  Rabbit Proof Fence|`|d55D0Ci4aa	Forest Gump<br>  Courage Under Fire<br>  Ruby Bridges<br>  Schindler's List<br>  Legally Blonde<br>  Legally Blonde II<br>  <br>  The Green Mile is about a large black man who has special powers, he can heal things....he is charged with murdering two little white girls ( he found them and was actually trying to save them, but it was too late).

Crappy.  Even if you can't find a decent price now, wait until 2-3 days before the concert and start looking.  They'll get nervous and bring prices down.  <br>  <br>  Stubhub especially will do this.  They let sellers choose this option.  They can post their ticket price and allow a decrease as they days pass and the concert nears.

AA10959572	Life has hard moments, but the alternative isn't a good thing.<br>  <br>  Life is a great thing, and I personally wish that I'd be able to live forever, or at least a few hundred years as there's so much to see, to do, to learn, to experience.<br>  <br>  I've been through more hells than most, but I still love life and wish there would be more hours in a day.<br>  <br>  Why you may ask?<br>  <br>  Because every time I survived something bad, I learned from it, and if there one thing that I'd tell you is that no matter how bad things can be, it will turn around.

vuCo9wZZaa	OH MY GOSH!  I just watched it.<br>  <br>  So they went to Cancun.  The fab five were all ticked at the Ambers and weren't going out of their way to include them.  They all went out to a club and the Ambers, Sarah and Ashley competed in a bathing suit contest.  Ashley and Sarah lost to a Mexican chick and were mad that they didn't win (though the Mexican chick was hot and not nearly as obnoxious).  Sarah kept saying that she has never lost a bikini contest in her life...either she's never entered one before or she has only competed against herself.<br>  <br>  The MC of the contest started yelling at Tiffany and told her to "shut the **** up" and to stop throwing ice.  Tiffany then went ballistic because she said she wasn't throwing ice.  And Whitney tried to get the guy to come out and apologize.  Ailea was wasted and decided to go after Amber M. who was plastered and dancing on the bar not bothering anyone.  So as they were leaving the bar because it was closing time, Ailea started yelling at Amber M and Amber M told them to go ahead and Whitney grabbed both of Amber's ears, and pulled her head down and Ailea jumped in and got in a couple of punches.  Amber M did her best to defend herself and grabbed onto Whitney's hair also.  Sarah was holding back Ailea and no one was helping Amber M (where was her buddy Amber B?  Coward.)  It broke up for a second and then Amber M threw her shoe at the girls and they all went after her, got her on the ground and started kicking her.  <br>  <br>  It ends with what appears to be an ambulance being called and the police arriving.  They showed the preview for next time of Amber M looking like she was in the hospital and the police showing up to arrest the girls.  Also it appears that a producer breaks the news to them that when there is such violence, there is only one thing that can happen....<br>  <br>  I could not believe how they went after Amber M.  It was just plain wrong. Ailea, Whitney and Tiffany should all have their butts thrown in jail and they should all have to go to mandatory anger management.|`|arjB50zBaa	They went to Cancun. And continued to argue! Thats all, lol.<br>  It was actually a pretty cheesy episode it just showed them drinking at the bars. A bikini contest got out of hand because the fab five wouldnt shut up, someone threw ice the announcer on stage got mad and yelled and Tiffany went off and had a tantrum yelling at EVERYONE. The boston chick got involved for no reason and had a tantrum too. Amber B just stood there and watched while the other Amber was in her own little world dancing inside. They had to leave and Aliea decided to get all big and bad and go after Cookie and all hell broke loose and between Aliea, boston and tiffany they jumped Cookie and kicked her while she was down. That is how it ended.<br>  I would like to see the fab five thrown in a mexican jail, I cant stand them. They are the true definition of "immature".|`|AA12336927	I LOVE bad girls club<br>  First answerer is right. Personally, they took out their anger on Cookie, when the beat down should have happened to Amber B<br>  <br>   I was shocked at how Tiffany acted, she must have been fed up to the brim or PMSing.

6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	How about "Sliding Doors"?|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	Would Return of the King count? As maybe having... 4 climaxes? :)<br>  <br>  At Minas Tirith, after the crowning celebration, and everyone in attendance bows down to the audience, and the music climaxes and then it zooms out and away and turns into the map of Middle Earth.<br>  <br>  Then the hobbits are returning to the Shire. They sit at the little pub with some pints, Sam goes to talk to Rosie and then it shows their wedding and everyone is happy and cheering and the music once again climaxes a little.<br>  <br>  Then Frodo is sitting and writing in Bag End. Sam comes in and talks to him, and Frodo closes his book saying "there's room for a little more." <br>  <br>  Then (with a very short cut) they are all traveling to the harbour and Frodo is going to leave and they are all crying and they all say goodbye, etc. <br>  <br>  THEN Sam is walking back to his home. "Well I'm back."<br>  <br>  I was sure the movie had ended about 5 times the first time I saw it.|`|9D1IPKlYaa	I was just gonna say Dark Knight but i saw u already wrote that. Van Helsing has 2.

There were some sad scenes, but I loved how it did flashbacks and showed his life to explain how he knew answers to the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire questions. It has really good music, and at the end its really cute because they show the little girl and the little boy dancing around together. It's worth going to see, definitely.|`|BW51kbI0aa	good, it is the best bollywood movie i've ever seen, no dance, no sing....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  two thumbs up|`|SKFIjyoVaa	it took about half of the oscars for feature film awards, that should say enough lol<br>  it was a great movie, a bit heavy at parts, but it shows u how tough things are over there|`|GfDX6UuEaa	Not bad, but definitely overrated.

9a384d40c397dc3065aeb9f23d18f7e7aa	ok, first things first, when camping be sure to pitch AWAY from the toilets, take tissues and hand sanitizer and keep all money and cards on you, security is about but they cant tell if someone is in YOUR tent from the thousands that are there.<br>  take water proofs and boots, trainers don't cut it unless its a really dry year or you don't mind wet feet all weekend.<br>  don't forget your toothbrush and take some bottled water to wash with or be smelly as well.<br>  pack as few things as you can, you will likely be a long way from parking to camping and even a light bag gets heavy after 30 a minute walk.<br>  don't take your most expensive camera, most take a mobile phone for pictures or a disposable camera.<br>  any girls in your group should think about getting a she-wee from a camping shop or online.|`|3qa3BftUaa	Dont forget your wellie boots|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Have Fun ..... no matter what happens ...Enjoy it ...|`|lv6nqW2Kaa	A group tent isn't a bad idea but id much prefer single tents for eachperson. take a few bottles of water with you and alcohol if you want it. Wet wipes are a good idea. washing isn't important at festivals.<br>  Foodwise go to a stall or a local supermarket, or take food with you and some way of cooking it. a few of my friends had a camping stove and a pan in which they boiled water for pot noodles and cooked beans. <br>  <br>  Im taking MRE's with me to the festivals this year. Theyre self heating ration packs. Id take a blow up pillow with you. a fork is handy as is money.

GiPinhjwaa	I would say use isohunt.com..it uses utorrent to download files, and its so easy. I would suggest don't use limewire because its just all about porn when you download things. Isohunt has new releases, old movies, tv shows, programs, pictures, clips, and the list goes on and on. In order to use isohunt, you have to download utorrent, but its very simple. It tells you the title, the size, how common it is being used, and if theres anything potentially dangerous about it. If you do use this program, when a movie is finished downloading, dont delete it right away because the way it works is that when someone downloads something, the next person that wants it is downloading it from you, so if you delete it, they cant get it, so please be nice and let it sit on there for a couple of days or so...email me back if it worked or not...guslover2389@yahoo.com or guslover2389@hotmail.com|`|NXrj93QWaa	Quite a few films you can download with Real Player, because they are in a format of Adobe Flash movies, once downloaded you can convert them to play on a DVD player with a free program which you can download and install named Any Video Converter....enjoy|`|iNRX3u38aa	u can use limewire|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	Torrents|`|GI27dKIkaa	DON'T use limewire !<br>  <br>  It's full of viruses !

It has moments of lucidity, but the Metal parts of it are unrelenting and in your face, especially the guitars and growly-vocals. I think the song Ghost of Perdition gives a pretty fair account of the aggressiveness of the album and the way the album was crafted, with each song going through massive tempo shifts and stylistic changes.<br>  <br>  Sadly, I'm not providing any links. It seems that all of the studio recordings have been removed from the various websites, and all that is available is live stuff, which I'm not fond of.|`|cLTbby44aa	First band that came to mind was At The Drive-In, extreme aggression yet impeccable musicianship. <br>  <br>  Try these songs: <br>  <br>  Arcarsenal <br>  Quarantined<br>  Transatlantic Foe <br>  Pattern Against User <br>  One Armed Scissor<br>  Invalid Litter Dept.|`|LkN5nr6faa	Dark Tranquility comes to mind.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyKl_MEKJFA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyKl_MEKJ...</a>|`|jfEb0tIJaa	Tool<br>  Mars Volta<br>  Isis<br>  Mastadon<br>  Mudvayne (Early stuff 1st 2 albums)<br>  Opeth|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Flogging Molly or Dropkick Murphys.|`|bb2c6db52d268375a8f75ea7c3169389aa	The Odyssey by Symphony X.

Pretty aggressive and very brilliant.|`|as5quv6Uaa	Killswitch Engage|`|uUDNcsyUaa	GOJIRA is the first band that came to mind for me|`|8Rwjvzhbaa	Thrash metal, especially Metallica, but also Slayer, Sepultura, etc.  Start with Metallica's "Master of Puppets".  Also look at earlier stuff like Iron Maiden and to a lesser extent Judas Priest.  And Black Sabbath would qualify pretty good as well.   And Jethro Tull's Aqualung is rather aggressive by c.1970 standards and also very well crafted.|`|r3vW3zU1aa	Metallica<br>  Avenged Sevenfold<br>  As Blood Runs Black<br>  Opeth<br>  Gojira<br>  Shape of Despair<br>  My Dying Bride<br>  Type O Negative<br>  Dream Theater<br>  Black Label Society<br>  Slipknot<br>  Katatonia<br>  Samael<br>  Hypocrisy<br>  Bleeding Through<br>  Trivium<br>  Immortal<br>  Sanctity<br>  Machine Head<br>  Dark Funeral<br>  Megadeth<br>  Anthrax<br>  Obituary<br>  World Funeral<br>  Iron Maiden<br>  Six Feet Under<br>  Soulfly<br>  Buckethead<br>  Nebucadnezzar<br>  Dimmu Borgir<br>  Lamb of God<br>  Satyricon|`|Vo9WWQpnaa	Atheist, Ephel Duath, Gojira, Mastodon|`|AGP2dI6uaa	Mastodon's music is like that.

The major second is abbreviated as M2; its inversion is the minor seventh. On a musical keyboard, a major second is the interval between two keys separated by one key, counting white and black keys alike. On a guitar string, it is the interval separated by two frets. In moveable-do solfège, it is the interval between do and re.

He'll still pop up though and check in (I believe).<br>  <br>  lol, I've been trying to shake my aquarius for years! however, i think if he would ever just say forget it - i would be hurting. :-(|`|ajzdsUldaa	If he really loved you, you will hear from him again in the future. If he didn't and it was just a fling to him, you'll never hear from him again.<br>  <br>  I'm an Aquarius, and I know if the relationship I am in now ever ends, I'd drop everything in future if another opportunity to re-build it ever arose. My friend (male Aquarius) also got back together with his childhood sweetheart.<br>  <br>  As for my other exes, I don't want anything to do with them. It's weird and inappropriate.|`|wBTX8lA6aa	aquas usually go back to their first love is what i have heard,i wouldnt be surprised if u heard from him again because aquas never really let go of the people they meet,most likely though he will call or email or something indirect in a very friendly manner even if he was feeling jealous,or regrets not being with u ..you wont know trust me.

While the piercing is in, you will loose muscle control it will get in the way of your mouthpiece, when it is out, you have hole(s) in your lip that can let the air escape. What's more important?

There is no egg in eggplant, nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat. We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.   <br>  <br>  <br>  And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth, beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices?  Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?   <br>  <br>  If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?  Have noses that run and feet that smell?   <br>  <br>  <br>  How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites? You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which, an alarm goes off by going on.   <br>  <br>  <br>  English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all. That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.   <br>  <br>   <br>  PS. - Why doesn't 'Buick' rhyme with 'quick' ? <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  There is a two-letter word that perhaps has more meanings than any other two-letter word, and that is   'UP.'   <br>  <br>  <br>  It's easy to understand  UP ,   meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list, but when we awaken in the morning, why do we wake   UP ? At a meeting, why does a topic come   UP   ? Why do we speak   UP and why are the officers   UP   for election and why is it   UP   to the secretary to write   UP   a report? We call   UP   our friends. And we use it to brighten   UP  a room, polish   UP   the   silver; we warm   UP   the leftovers and clean   UP   the kitchen. We lock   UP   the house and some guys fix   UP   the old car. At other times the little word has real special meaning. People stir   UP    trouble, line  UP   for tickets, work   UP   an   appetite, and think UP  excuses. To be dressed is one thing, but to be dressed UP   is special. And this   UP   is confusing: A drain must be opened   UP   because it is stopped UP . We open   UP   a store in the morning but we close it   UP  at night. We seem to be pretty mixed UP   about   UP   !  To be knowledgeable about the proper uses of   UP ,   look the word   UP  in the dictionary. In a desk-sized dictionary, it takes   UP      almost 1/4th of the page and can add   UP   to about thirty definitions. If you are   UP   to it, you might try building  UP   a list of the many ways   UP   is used. It will take   UP   a lot of your time, but if you don't give   UP , you may wind   UP   with a  hundred or more. When it threatens to rain, we say it is clouding   UP   . When the sun comes out we say it is clearing   UP .. When it rains, it wets the earth and often messes things   UP . When it doesn't rain for awhile, things dry   UP . One could go on and on, but I'll wrap it    UP ,   for now my time   is   UP ,   so........it is time to shut   UP !   <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh . . . one more thing:   <br>  <br>   <br>  What is the first thing you do in the morning & the last thing you do at night?

cr5TQgmUaa	According to DaytimeRoyalty.com: This week, both SOD and SOW have articles about the Katherine story. Included on the site is a summation of both articles.<br>  <br>  After the explosion, she decides to act like she can't remember the explosion. She tells Amber and Esther that she doesn't remember the last couple of months. She doesn't want to keep hurting the people around her.<br>  <br>  Billy walks by her hospital room door and she says "What are you doing back from Hong Kong?" That would not be something Marge would know. Kay asks him things that would be in the stream of Katherine's knowledge.<br>  <br>  When a psychiatrist shows up to discuss her memory loss he tells her that her dental records are missing. She realizes the doctor is going to keep her "in the loony bin" until they figure out who she is. So she declares "I'm Marge. I've been lying all along. Just give me my clothes and let me out of here."<br>  <br>  Kay doesn't think she'll be able to prove her true identity if she's stuck in the hospital.<br>  <br>  Jill walks by and hears Kay's declaration. Later she goes to Nikki and tells her all about it.<br>  <br>  ---- > So it looks like they're going to drag it out for a while longer. Probably when Mackenzie comes home<br>  .|`|AA11111233	It'll probably happen next week.

12QJ9QMRaa	Cliff Burton <br>  <br>  he was a one of a kind musician, the type that you can never truly replace.  He was a normal joe, but at the same time he not only had rare talent, but a virtuouso spirit, and a deep understanding of music, not just Metal.<br>  <br>  Next for me is Rob Trujillo.  I disagree about the style.  Remember, he didn't join the  band til after St Anger was recorded, so those are not his Bass lines, and the ones in Death Magnetic are great.<br>  <br>  More importantly, he brings and attitude to the stage that Jason never really had.  Not entirely by his own fault, but for his whole career it was Metallica and JAson...... he was never really one of them.   Also recall he had to be taught ht ecorrect way to play by Bob Rock on the Black album, as he was mimicking James guitar lines before (and didithe same in Flotsam and Jetsam) instead of playing with the Drums.  So a lot of Jason's style was Bob's influence.  He was a good player, but never really fit Metallica.<br>  <br>  Also, Rob, unlike Jason actually knows and plays ALL of Cliffs bass lines correctly.  In other words, not only does he play with his fingers, but unlike Jason he doens't need to use alternative picking and other changes to Cliffs compositions.<br>  <br>  There is a reason that Metallica NEVER platyed Orion live before Rob joined the band (sadly, even Cliff never performed it in concert) and that is quite siply because Jason COULDN'T play it.<br>  <br>  Rob can.  What makes Rob special is that there is basically no style Rob cannot and has not played.   He is stillno Cliff, but he is one of the top 5 playing in Metal today.<br>  <br>  Jason would be my third choice.  For the reasons stated, above, and in the end he came into a long term lose/lose situation.  I like Jason, but having listened and learned bass lines from both him and Rob, and having watched both in concert several times, I will take Rob anyday of the weeek.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for McGovney...lets face it, he was jsut a place holder til they found a real player.<br>  <br>  **Actually...  ^^^^^^^ was my edit, DevilsReject...

Cliff  was a great one and even Jason, i mean they were the ones with the band at the time of success and fame. Yes, personally Jason is my favourite. But, just because the sound of the last two albums are different, it does not mean that Rob is not a good bassist. He is good, but the sound is different. And sound does not matter or effect in the skills of playing. That's all.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Cliff,He didn't want to "sell out".He was the soul of metallica maybe even the heart.<br>  He was taken too early : (<br>  <br>  <br>  Peaches is cooking something with that edit.<br>  Edit:Peaches is right cliff will never be able to "replace" he was one of a kind.Rob does bring a great attitude to the stage that jason never brought.<br>  <br>  Peaches*Go to work...and Too much depth? no i think thats just about right knowing you,you can probably ramble on this for anoth 20-30 lines|`|OTFzJbaMaa	robert truheeeoo!<br>  <br>  hes a terrific bassist and a funny person.|`|zUi3nIPRaa	cliff burton!!!!!|`|625IwsqAaa	Cliff Burton, of course.<br>  He lived and breathed bass guitar.<br>  He played with his fingers and could still do those crazy riffs....jeez. I've been playing 4 years and I still have difficulties. He loved what he did and he was....there's no word for it. Amazing? Awesome? Godly? No words come remotely close. And on top of all of that, he was modest. He'd probably blush if he saw how many people have written his name on this question......zomg I wish he was still alive. =[[[<br>  <br>  Rob Trujillo is my 2nd favorite because he's the closest they've come to Cliff. He also plays with his fingers and he CAN do Cliff's bass lines. He does them well, too. He seems to know a lot about music and I've liked his work with other bands. (like Suicidal Tendencies and others.) I think he's a pretty good fit with Metallica and I hope they rock one for many more years! :D|`|4e11GJVZaa	Cliff Burton is undoubtedly the best bass player Metallica has ever had, and probably one of the best of all time. This guy could shred a bass better than James could shred his guitar probably. Plus he could play with his fingers and keep up with James and Kirk's insanely fast riffs. Jason had good stage presence, but his playing and songwriting left much to be desired. I think Rob can play some cool groovy stuff, while keeping up with the metal delivered from James.|`|vVe2vAVtaa	Cliff BurtonCliff BurtonCliff BurtonCliff BurtonCliff BurtonCliff Burton<br>  <br>  Without a doubt, Cliff-but for more reasons than simply being the most proficient musician/instrumentalist of the lot (which could be debated anyway). Quite simply, the albums featuring Cliff are far and away the band's best efforts. "And Justice For All" had some good music, but the recording quality is so horrible one cannot really even hear Jason's playing, and the band took a serious nose dive starting with the "black album" (much less interesting lyrically and musically, and the musicianship has steadily declined).<br>  <br>  Burton was better bassist than Newsted and should not be compared because the answer is obvious.<br>  Newsted is a good player and a respectful bassist too. Its a shame that the others metallica members never look it in that way.<br>  RIP Cliff<br>  <br>  if you don't think so then check this out.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv63Kt5i_LY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv63Kt5i_...</a><br>  <br>  i think he really brought something special to metallica...<br>  so sad he had to go..............|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	Cliff Burton<br>  However Jason Newsted is very good himself,but Metallica never let his talent shine.Check out his work with Flotsam & Jetsam.<br>  He was the band lyricist,and bassist for them.<br>  Then Robert Trujillo.He has a lot of talent.And was a beast with "Suicidal Tendencies" and he can play the Cliff Burton songs perfectly.<br>  I'm not all that familar with Ron Mcgovney.I've heard some of the stuff he did on the Metallica demos but don't I think it's great.|`|GsSRY7quaa	Jason, he's a crowd pleaser, always coming down to the fans to be around them, I'm sorry he left Metallica|`|1iqeWBisaa	One vote for Jason Newsted.

wZa3qiSbaa	Perseverance in your work this day should be exercised as much as possible--especially since slow and steady wins the race. Your judgment is good and will lead to success. This is a time for imagination and creativity when it comes to ideas and thinking. This, coupled with the ability to put your thoughts into words, allows you to captivate and spellbind. This could be a period of intellectual creativity. Careful--beating the odds through cleverness is appealing and this may lead to an interest in all kinds of financial speculations. Emotions in particular, or the feelings of those around you, may be very clear today. You appear perhaps more charming and refined than usual. Now could be the best time to make that special date you have been thinking about lately.|`|GpcbuAfmaa	Need to know your country and town of birth<br>  <br>  eg: Dublin, Ireland<br>  <br>  If not, your horoscope for today is: "At this time you must guard against being too aggressive, coming on too strong, or trying to force your own will and thereby arousing hostility in others. Also, frustrated desires and obstacles to achieving your aims can evoke enormous anger in you, and you may do something rash and regrettable. Conflicts and confrontations may be unavoidable, but do try to avoid situations which you know will provoke or irritate you. Working alone is best at this time."|`|sHzP9u5Taa	if you want to know your birth chart and all that kinda stuff, theres books you can buy that tell you all about, Waterstones sell them, you just pick out your star sign then use your date of birth and work it out, its very easy and the books probably under a tenner<br>  <br>  xxx

Its definitely a little harsh, I agree. Try and look at it from his perspective though. If I was feeling really hurt after a bad break up I'd want my ex to feel the same way. It's human nature. I think that's where this song is coming from. <br>  <br>  I'd like to point out that I think they only performed this live once and they never recorded it or put it on an album.

I thought about mentioning it. But I mentioned Savoy Brown once before and got some thumbs down. Go figure.
yjSGVfdiaa	01. Sonic Youth<br>  <br>  02. mid-90s probably - I had a friend hand me a copy of "Screaming Fields of Sonic Love," a greatest hits compilation, and I had to seek out where these songs were coming from.<br>  <br>  03. They're still making music today, and will be releasing a new album in a few months.<br>  <br>  04. Daydream Nation.  It's one of my favorite albums period. Such a great blend of the avant garde, punk, and alternative pop/rock.  Lee Renaldo's Eric's Trip is probably his best, while Candle, Silver Rocket, and Teenage Riot are all standouts for Thurston Moore.  The album flows and oscillates until you get to the trilogy and Kim Gordon blows everybody away with one of the most acerbic and grating, yet beautiful songs I had heard up until that point, as screaming fields of sonic love explode around her and Thurston's vocals.<br>  <br>  05. That's a very difficult question... for each performer/writer I have a preference<br>  Thurston Moore: Diamond Sea<br>  Lee Ranaldo: Eric's Trip or Karen Revisited<br>  Kim Gordon: Kissability or Kim Gordon and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream<br>  Steve Shelley: Silver Rocket<br>  <br>  06. My least favorite is probably A Thousand Leaves.  It was an uneven effort from them, and, I think, sparked a transition for them - moving on to Murray Street after that which is probably my second favorite album fo theirs.  So, it might also be in comparison.  The late-90s in general weren't great for the Sonics until they started making the SYR series.  That seemed to reinvigorate them.<br>  <br>  07. Side2Side - trite lyrics and songwriting, though hypnotic when performed live<br>  <br>  08. I never get specifically in a mood to listen to Sonic Youth.  They tend to be my default anytime band.  If I can't figure out what I want to listen to, or can't pinpoint a mood, I put on Sonic Youth and I'm always happy I did.  Though when the new album comes out I'll definitely go through a month or two where they'll be all I listen to.<br>  <br>  09. I've seen them live 4 times. Approximately 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2005, if I had to guess based on when their albums came out.  Saw them headline each time in Philadelphia.<br>  <br>  10. 30 LPs and EPs a single and a split-single with Mudhoney<br>  <br>  11. I try to get as many rare recordings as possible.  I love SYR 4 - Goodbye Twentieth Century.  It's Sonic Youth interpreting the works of great twentieth century composers that influenced their work.<br>  <br>  12. duplicate question?<br>  <br>  13. Thurston Moore - definitely seems like a really intelligent, cool guy.|`|dqCTS60raa	1- my favorite band is KoRn<br>  <br>  2* about a year ago when I read heads book "Save me from myself."<br>  <br>  3- Yes they were still making music when I found about them<br>  <br>  4 my favorite album is ISSUES because I just love it, its awnsome.<br>  <br>  5- I have a lot of favorite song from Korn but if I had to choose I would have been Freak on a leash<br>  <br>  6- mmm the new one u guess eventho it has some pretty good songs.<br>  <br>  7.

Do I really need to explain why? everyone knows it's one of the best albums of all time.<br>  05. Dogs, perfect song!<br>  06.

A Night At The Opera. -Such a fantastic album from beginning to end, and one of the few albums I can listen to all the way through.<br>  5. Bohemian Rhapsody - I don't think I can really explain why, the song is just filled with greatness, and the mystery of it all captivates me.<br>  6. Hot Space - The just got away from everything they were when they started.<br>  7. Dragon Attack - Just wasn't typical Queen.  The lyrics are mediocre at best, and the beat sounded too "funky" to be Queen.<br>  8. Anytime, anywhere.<br>  9. No, and I never will have the chance.<br>  10.  I have 12 on my Zune software, but I have 5 actual vinyls.<br>  11 and 12. Not really, I do like to listen to some rare stuff of theirs tho.<br>  13. Brian May.  The guy is so mellow and insightful.  Not really the typical rock star, and he uses his status to do some good in the world.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	1. Motley Crue<br>  2.

Were they still making music when you discovered them?<br>  Nope, they were way before my time. <br>  <br>  04. Of all their records, which is your favorite and why?<br>  Ummm.. Rubber Soul. It makes me sooo happy. And it was SUCH a huge turning point (for the better in my opinion) on their music.<br>  <br>  05. Of all their songs, which is your favorite and why?<br>  Oh God, you really cant make me choose. Among them are Norwegian Wood, Something, Two Of Us, A Day In The Life, and Can't Buy Me love. Oh, and Til There was You, and I've Got  A feeling. <br>  <br>  06. Which is your least favorite of their albums and why?<br>  This is hard, but possibly, umm.. Please Please Me? or maybe With  The Beatles or Meet The Beatles?<br>  Though its hard to choose a least favorite, everything they did was amazing, it just got better with time, so i would have to pick getting rid of the early stuff. <br>  <br>  07.

Pavement<br>  2. somewhere in 1995<br>  3. yeah, they put out 2 new records after I got into them.<br>  4. Terror Twilite, because I really appreciate the sort of intersection of Pavement and Nigel Godrich. Kind of like how Trompe Le Monde wasn't really the most "Pixies" of Pixies albums Terror Twilite is probably the least signature "Pavement-y" but I just think a lot of things connected brilliantly on it. I love where the songwriting went. Where Malkmus' writing was focused. I would actually recommend that someone getting into Pavement probably get it as one of the last two purchases, much like Trompe Le Monde with the Pixies, but it is still my favorite.<br>  5. It constantly flips around, but probably Transport is Arranged. I love the aesthetic of it. I love how the b-section comes in and developes. It's just such an awesome track. Great from all the angles. <br>  6. Probably Westing, but I still love it. It was their first record and they just matured into something so much greater. It really is a wonderful record though.<br>  7. Decouvert De Soleil. It's a b-side that's just a little too thrown together for me. I'm probably wrong, but it just feels really, really phoned in and not necessarily in a charming way. It's a perma skip track. It's probably the only song of theirs that I just don't like.<br>  8. Anywhere, anytime. I don't always choose to listen to them, but they're always good. I suppose there is one specific though. They are really great for road trips. Great traveling music.<br>  9. 6 or 7 times. 9 or 10 if you count Malkmus solo. Always just at spots around L.A. I saw Malkmus once in San Diego. I just saw every nearby show that came up after I got into them. Back to back nights at the El Rey (plus, I think it was two other times there). Universal Amplitheatre, the Palace, and Lollapalooza.<br>  10. All 6, plus various singles and the reissues except for Brighten the Corners, but I already had the album and most of the other stuff so I grabbed the tracks I was missing from the iTunes store.<br>  11. I got some little oddities during the first days of Napster before I understood the sort of moral ambiguity of it. Lost most of it anyways over time and switching computers. The one thing I'm pissed about not having is this version of Steve and I think Scott doing this really sassy and sarcastic version of Wonderwall on some radio show. I also have this weird home demo Steve made of a song from his first record. Other than that nothing too terribly interesting. A lot of stuff, but not much that sounds so great.<br>  12. see 11<br>  13. Probably Steve Malkmus, but really I would moreso love to just be a fly on the wall while the Jicks had a longer practice.|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	01.

In fact, "Owner" was from their comeback album.<br>  <br>  4. "Close to the Edge." The pinnacle of progressive rock creativty, IMO. Mind-blowing music from beginning to end.<br>  <br>  5. Lately, it's been "Heart of the Sunrise." It's got everything -- dramatic shifts in mood and tempo, counterpoint, a classical-like logical structure, virtuoso performances, great singing ... and it ROCKS.<br>  <br>  6. "Union." It was a bad corporate attempt to put together two different versions of Yes during a split. And neither band was up to the challenge.<br>  <br>  7. I like almost everything, but there's a song called "No Way We Can Lose" that's really miserable. A bunch of white English guys in their 50s trying to do reggae? Ugh.<br>  <br>  8. Usually at night, with headphones, when I have no other distractions. It's detail-oriented music and demands the listener's attention.<br>  <br>  9. Probably a dozen times. First time in 1991 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Last time ... I think 2002 in Detroit.<br>  <br>  10. Around 30. 18 studio albums, 5 or 6 live albums, and a few compilations and box sets. (Can't give you an exact number -- it's not here at work with me!)<br>  <br>  11. I have one bootleg recording from their 1980 tour. They performed a few songs on that tour that never got released until a few years ago -- but I'd bought the bootleg before that.<br>  <br>  12. See above :)<br>  <br>  13. Chris Squire. Awesome bass player, and he knows how to party, even for an old guy. Plus, today is his birthday. Really, it is. March 4.|`|qz9trhYhaa	01. Who is your favorite band or artist?<br>  Strike Anywhere<br>  <br>  02. When did you find out about them?<br>  January 2008<br>  <br>  03. Were they still making music when you discovered them?<br>  Yeah they've only been around for about a decade.<br>  <br>  04. Of all their records, which is your favorite and why?<br>  Change is a sound, I just love the lyrics and music.<br>  <br>  05. Of all their songs, which is your favorite and why?<br>  Sunset on 32nd because its the first I heard and the lyrics are really deep.<br>  <br>  06. Which is your least favorite of their albums and why?<br>  Exit English, I never took the time to listen to it thoroughly.<br>  <br>  07. Which is your least favorite of their songs and why?<br>  I don't actually have a least favorite, I like all of their stuff. But as I said, I should listen more thoroughly to some material.<br>  <br>  08. When and where do you like to listen to this band/artist?<br>  Doesn't matter, if I'm scrolling through my Zune/Software and I see a song I'll click it.<br>  <br>  09. Have you seen them live?

If you could only hang out with one member of the band for a day, who?<br>  Thomas Barnett... The singer. Why? Because I love his vocal style. When he sings he has a cool voice, and when he's shouting/screaming or whatever its called, it really fits the music. He seems like a cool guy, as well.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	01. Who is your favorite band or artist?   KISS<br>  <br>  02. When did you find out about them? 1977.  I was 6 years old.<br>  <br>  03. Were they still making music when you discovered them?   Yes, they were at their popularity peak.<br>  <br>  04. Of all their records, which is your favorite and why?   I love 'Hotter Than Hell'.  The production is shoddy, but the songs are really solid.    Besides, every KISS fan's favorite record is 'Destroyer', and while great, it's just not my favorite.<br>  <br>  05. Of all their songs, which is your favorite and why?   This is like asking me to pick a favorite child.   My answer to this would change every 3-5 minutes.<br>  <br>  06. Which is your least favorite of their albums and why?  'Crazy Nights'.   Excepting "Reason To Live", it's an audio turd.<br>  <br>  07. Which is your least favorite of their songs and why?  "Danger" came to mind immediately.   It's just...lame.   It's a filler track.<br>  <br>  08. When and where do you like to listen to this band/artist?   Every day, I have to listen to them just a little bit.<br>  <br>  09. Have you seen them live? If so, where and when?  <br>  <br>  1990, Atlanta, GA<br>  1992, Landover, MD<br>  1995, Burbank, CA (KISS Konvention)<br>  1996, Atlanta, GA (2 shows)<br>  1997, Columbus, GA<br>  2000, Atlanta, GA<br>  (Ace Frehley solo :1994 w/Peter Criss, 1995 in San Diego, CA, and 2008 in Atlanta, GA)<br>  (Paul Stanley solo : 2006 in Atlanta, GA)<br>  <br>  10. How many records by this band/artist do you have?   All of them, except for the ridiculously large amount of greatest hits collections they produce.   <br>  <br>  11. Do you collect rare recordings by this band/artist? If so, what is your favorite of these recording?   I have a bootleg of them recorded in 1974 here in Atlanta that I like.  I also have another from the same tour that was recorded, I think, in DC.<br>  <br>  12. Do you collect rare recordings by this band/artist? If so, what is your favorite of these recording?   TRICK QUESTION!!!!<br>  <br>  13. If you could only hang out with one member of the band for a day, who?   REALLY torn here....it would either be Ace, because I think he'd be hilarious to be around, or Gene Simmons, because I can relate to him in many ways.   He's a total asshole, but he's got a brilliant business mind I'd love to pick, and has a good sense of humor when he lets his guard down.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	1. Guns N Roses<br>  <br>  2. 1987<br>  <br>  3.

Not really fond of covers  <br>  <br>  07. None I love them all<br>  <br>  08. Home, work, esp in the car!<br>  <br>  09. 1993 Hartford CT<br>  <br>  10.  All<br>  <br>  <br>  11.

Yes, and they still are to this day.<br>  <br>  4.) Subterranea; it is one of their masterpieces.  Neo-prog at its finest.  <br>  <br>  5.) "Harvest of Souls" from Dark Matter (nicely structured suite and a justified critque of American political culture)<br>  <br>  6.) Are You Sitting Comfortably?  Different lead singer and with a more pop-oriented direction.  I can only tolerate it once in a while.<br>  <br>  7.) "Drive On"  was very typical of late 80s pop music...nuff said.<br>  <br>  8.) On both my home & work PCs, in my car stereo, at anytime, though most preferably when I have those moments of self-reflection and needless ponderance of everyday life.<br>  <br>  9.)

Sigur Rós<br>  2. Last February<br>  3. Yes<br>  4. ág?tis byrjun. It's definitely their "best" and what they consider to be their actual "beginning". It had Post-Rock esque elements to it that I like and prefer but also has a variety of songs. It resembles them as a band. <br>  5. í Gaer. The drumming. Orri creates this awesome mood with his cymbals and a lot of this type of music, to me, is about their use of cymbals to create build ups. Theirs a build up in here every 45 seconds. It's the song by them that gets me the most emotional out of all of them. <br>  6. Mee sue í eyrum vie spilum endalaust. It's their newest and most different album. I don't know if I like the direction that they are heading in as much. It's definitely a great album. <br>  7. Gobbledigook. I've never liked it. (Probably because its too "happy". They bring out a different happiness for me that has a bit of moroseness to it. Which wasn't seen in this song). Also the vocals are disappointing and it is their most "single"-esque song. <br>  8.

I would have trouble picking a favourite, but the first Queen album I bought was A Kind of Magic, so I'll go with that one for nostalgic reasons<br>  <br>  5. Again, I can't pick a favourite - I love almost all of their songs!  However, one I that I always come back to is 'It's a Hard Life' (The Works)<br>  <br>  6. Least favourite album - although the score is great, the one I listen to the least is 'Flash Gordon' (most Queen fans will probably say 'Hot Space', but I love that album!)<br>  <br>  7. Least favourite song - would be a tie between Coming Soon and Now I'm Here - they just don't appeal to me as much as some of Queen's more epic and melodic tunes!<br>  <br>  8. I like to listen to Queen anywhere and everywhere!  I listen to them at work (with headphones on, of course!), when I'm exercising, when I'm sleeping, when I'm sick and when I'm feeling down, and happy...<br>  <br>  9. I didn't get to see Queen live :-( they came out to Australia around the time I became a fan, but I didn't know (boo hoo!) I have seen We Will Rock you twice (once in London, once in Australia), the tribute band 'A Kind of Magic' twice, and also Brian May in concert.  Close, but no cigar!<br>  <br>  10. I have all of their records on vinyl (well, except for the latest Queen + Paul Rodgers, no thanks!) <br>  <br>  11. Yes, I used to - my favourite would be a 12" promo single for Freddie Mercury's 'I Was Born to Love You'.<br>  <br>  12. Freddie Mercury (when he was alive, of course!)  That would be amazing.|`|Vu4A83dyaa	01. Who is your favorite band or artist?<br>  Motley Crue<br>  <br>  02. When did you find out about them?<br>  About two years ago<br>  <br>  03.

Were they still making music when you discovered them? Still are!<br>  <br>  04. Of all their records, which is your favorite and why? "Vs" I love the collection of songs. They all say "F*** You" in their own way.<br>  <br>  05. Of all their songs, which is your favorite and why? "Black" Its incredibly tragic and I can relate to the lyrics. Plus, I love the piano crashing behind a bellowing Eddie Vedder.<br>  <br>  <br>  06. Which is your least favorite of their albums and why? "Riot Act" I thought it was not their greatest effort.<br>  <br>  07. Which is your least favorite of their songs and why? "Stupid Mop" Its a stupid song.<br>  <br>  08.

Eddie Vedder no doubt|`|yS61H04haa	01. Tool<br>  <br>  02. A friend told me about them. ( back when Opiate was new )<br>  <br>  03. yes! and they still are! :))<br>  <br>  04. Probably Aenima, though there isn't a bad album. I can put in Aenima and just relax. <br>  <br>  05. I can't pick a favorite song by them. I just can't do it!<br>  <br>  <br>  06. Salival, only because its new music.<br>  <br>  07. Sober, I just can't listen to it. I am so sick of that song! MAjor burn out!<br>  <br>  08. They are a band that I can listen to anytime anywhere . <br>  <br>  09. I have....I'll have try to remember the dates. But it was in Memphis, Tenn. <br>  <br>  10. All of em!<br>  <br>  <br>  11. Well I pirated some live bootlegs off the internet but other than that no. I wouldn't have done that , but these were things I couldn't actually buy :(<br>  <br>  <br>  12. No<br>  <br>  13. I would hang out with Maynard. He is so funny.|`|3cae1a173ced8370d2a6d3af83b9b006aa	1.  Electric Light Orchestra aka ELO aka Jeff Lynne.<br>  <br>  2.  Bought their 'Out Of The Blue' record by mistake in 1978.<br>  <br>  3.  Yes.  'Out Of The Blue' was the first album EVER in HISTORY to be pre-ordered over a million copies.<br>  <br>  4.  'Out Of The Blue' because it was not only my first ELO album but my first album ever and everything else (for the longest time) was compared to that masterpiece of music.<br>  <br>  5.  'Ticket To The Moon'  I want it played at my funeral :)<br>  <br>  6.  Least fave album by ELO is their debut (No Answer) but I still love it and it's raw experimental sound fits in with today's music more than it did when it came out in 1971.<br>  <br>  7.  'Another Heart Breaks'  It's an instrumental, which was the last track of Side One on vinyl.  It's one of those songs that is great for making you sleepy, so if you didn't flip the album over 'before' the song played, you might just find yourself too sleepy to get up and flip it over to the amazing Side Two of their 'Time' album.  At least you don't have to flip the cd over...lol<br>  <br>  8.  In the car, when I'm cleaning, especially in HEADPHONES at night.  I'm usually alone though as they are my guilty pleasure (with respect to 'Milli Vanilli'  lol  I'm serious)<br>  <br>  9.  No.  I've never seen them live.  At their peak, 1977-1981, their concert stage was a huge UFO which 'lifted up' revealing the band to play live.  I was just too young to go see them then  :(<br>  <br>  10.  I have all their original albums and some collections on vinyl I have about 18.  On cd I have all the same ones on vinyl PLUS the newly Remasters of each.  They do have over 80 compilation cds, though I only have about 5 of those...lol<br>  <br>  11.  Every American/UK band/artist (by Japanese Law) has to add one song to every album that is ONLY available on the Japanese release.  When they released 'Zoom' in 2001, I bought the Japanese Import just to get the extra song, which was called 'Long Black Road' and was basically Jeff Lynne, Mike Campbell and Tom Petty (I think Ringo did the drums as well on this track).  I would love to buy all their albums in Japanese Import form and suggest you do the same for you favorite band/artists because it's the only way to get these extra songs, usually.<br>  <br>  12.  (see #11. :)  )<br>  <br>  13.  JEFF LYNNE!!!!|`|yhqa5FIXaa	I'M BAAAAAAAACCCCCCCKKKKKK (decided to return to R&P after hanging out everywhere else for like 3 months)<br>  I'm picking a post 2000 band for this:<br>  <br>  1. The Killers<br>  <br>  2. On VH1 when they were "you oughta know artists", that was about the time the "Somebody Told Me" video came out<br>  <br>  3. yes they had just started when I found them<br>  <br>  4. My favorite record was Hot Fuss but now it's most definetly Day & Age. I like the synth-pop feel to it and I like that most people have no idea what the hell Brandon Flowers is talking about anymore.<br>  <br>  5. It's a tie between Under the Gun, Move Away, and A Crippling Blow. All three are amazing and the lyrics aren't half bad either.<br>  <br>  6. Sawdust. It got really old, really fast. But there are some great tracks on there.<br>  <br>  7. My least favorte song is probably their cover of "Romeo and Juliet", I just don't dig it. lol<br>  <br>  8. I listen to it anytime, any place<br>  <br>  9. I haven't seen them live because everytime they come to Madison Square Garden, they get completely sold out. <br>  <br>  10. I have all four albums. Hot Fuss, Sam's Town, Sawdust, and Day & Age<br>  <br>  11. no, I think Sawdust was all their B-sides and rare recordings :/<br>  <br>  12. ^<br>  <br>  13. Brandon Flowers, we could make fun of Pete Wentz and all the other so called emo bands ;)|`|9AAGosuiaa	01. Radiohead<br>  <br>  02. 1992 when I heard a song called "creep" before the release of the first album<br>  <br>  03. they were just getting started<br>  <br>  04. The new one "In Rainbows" I know most people think OK Computer as the masterpiece and it certainly is but as a collection of moving, personal and engaging songs I think In Rainbows is the finest collection to date from these Oxfordshire lads.<br>  <br>  05. this changes all the time but right now its the song "All I Need"<br>  \<br>  06. Pablo Honey for the reason please see below<br>  <br>  07. "Creep" which is not the worst song they ever did, see "Pop Is Dead" for that but I say "creep" because that seems to be the only song that most people think of when you say you love Radiohead and they have much better songs to reference<br>  <br>  08. anytime I'm feeling stressed <br>  <br>  09. the last time was in August at the Hollywood Bowl<br>  <br>  10. all of them, plus dozens of bootleg recordings <br>  <br>  11. there are so many, but I love the cover of "Nobody Does It Better"<br>  Thom announces at the start of this live recording that its the "sexiest song" ever written..<br>  <br>  12. I will use this question to talk about a couple of B-sides that I love.<br>  punchdrunk lovesick singalong, talk show host,Polyethelene Parts 1 & 2,Up On The Ladder,Maquiladora,and last flowers to the hospital just to name a couple....<br>  <br>  13.Either Jonny or Thom would make my entire life just to have a moment to talk music with either of em...<br>  <br>  I had fun with this, Thanks Alex|`|DsF05nHZaa	1. Metallica<br>  2. when I was about 11<br>  3. Yes! Death Magnetic...they still got it!<br>  4. Kill 'Em All, that album defines trash metal<br>  5. Matester of Puppets, no other song causes massive hysteria in me<br>  6. ReLoad, not there highest point in their career<br>  7. Prince Charming, just didn't feel it<br>  8.

When did you find out about them? - Probably in 2001. I loved them since.<br>  <br>  03. Were they still making music when you discovered them? - Yes but it was relatively early in their career.<br>  <br>  04. Of all their records, which is your favorite and why? - "Reise, Reise" is my favourite. It has my favourite songs on there. Also it is an example as to how they can make a hard as nails angry song but then also a soft ballad.<br>  <br>  05. Of all their songs, which is your favorite and why? - "Mein Teil" is. Its about that German cannibal Armin Miewes. I love that song because it is so dark and morbid and makes me feel good. I like the dark part of life.<br>  <br>  06. Which is your least favorite of their albums and why? - Rosenrot. I found that their sound was starting to go a little off course, it got a lot lighter and sort of depressing. I understand them evolving but I still love their older stuff.<br>  <br>  07. Which is your least favorite of their songs and why? - Herzeleid, one of their first songs. I find it annoying because Till (the singer) sounds out every syllable in the words he sings, so it takes him like 10 seconds to say a word.<br>  <br>  08. When and where do you like to listen to this band/artist? - ALWAYS. Because they are able to experiment so well they've made songs for every mood: when you're angry, sad, euphoric, horny... they've managed it all. I usually listen to them on my PC when I'm drinking.<br>  <br>  09. Have you seen them live? If so, where and when? - I can only dream... they haven't toured in like 3 years now, they were on a break and making a new album. Also I live in South Africa so the chances are minute. There is really only a small following of Rammstein fans here. I'd give anything to go, including my dignity.<br>  <br>  10. How many records by this band/artist do you have? - I have 2 albums, 1 live performance and one compilation DVD (made up of concerts, interviews, music videos, etc). I must buy them all still.<br>  <br>  11. Do you collect rare recordings by this band/artist? If so, what is your favorite of these recording? - There aren't any rare recordings really. Everything they've made is out there, not hiding. I would like to hear their music from each member before they were in Rammstein.<br>  <br>  12. Do you collect rare recordings by this band/artist? If so, what is your favorite of these recording? - Ditto.<br>  <br>  13. If you could only hang out with one member of the band for a day, who? - I'd say... Paul Landers. He's the rhythm guitarist of the band and he always looks like fun. He's always happy and extremely enthusiastic about playing and acting out on stage. He's also a self taught guitarist so I'd really want some advice and help with my guitar playing.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Metallica<br>  early 90's<br>  Yes<br>  master of puppets because they did their absolute best<br>  creeping death because I love it<br>  st anger & death magnetic-they aren't the 80's metallica I love  <br>  songs on those 2 albums<br>  wherever and whenever<br>  Yes back in 2001 in Mass.<br>  about 15 includingmiscellaneouss cd's<br>  demo of metal up your a**<br>  SAME Q<br>  JAMES HETFELD<br>  <br>  <br>  OTHER FAVORITE<br>  Pantera<br>  late 90's<br>  yes<br>  101 cause it has most my favorite songs on it<br>  becoming and suicide note part 2-they kick a**<br>  power metal<br>  walk-over played<br>  all the time<br>  no I WISH<br>  almost all<br>  I collect whatever i can find<br>  ALL 4 mostly DIME|`|p9Wtbizuaa	1.Metallica<br>  2.

Were they still making music when you discovered them?... yes they just came out with a album last May<br>  <br>  04. Of all their records, which is your favorite and why?... Dr. Feelgood because there is not one bad song on that record<br>  <br>  05. Of all their songs, which is your favorite and why?... Kickstart My Heart because what the song is really about is really deep.<br>  <br>  <br>  06. Which is your least favorite of their albums and why?... Motley Crue self- titled album because it doesn't have the original members.<br>  <br>  07. Which is your least favorite of their songs and why?... Red Hot. I just never liked it. <br>  <br>  08. When and where do you like to listen to this band/artist?... when and whenever I can<br>  <br>  09. Have you seen them live? If so, where and when?... Yes.

If you could only hang out with one member of the band for a day, who?... Nikki Sixx of course|`|2i6TPlauaa	1. The Velvet Underground are my favorite band.<br>  2. I think it was 2006.<br>  3. No!<br>  4. I usually can't decide between "The Velvet Underground & Nico" and "White Light/White Heat". They're both so raw and lo-fi. Lo-fi aesthetic on high. I'll go with "The VU & Nico". It's my favorite.<br>  5. I usually say "Venus In Furs" because it is what they're all about and it sums them up nicely. Or "Heroin". Or "I Heard Her Call My Name". Ahh! There's too many!<br>  6. I would say "Squeeze", but I don't count it as a real VU album. So "Loaded", because it is just the record company trying to get hits out of them.<br>  7. I would say anything Yule did! Or "Sunday Morning"; it just doesn't go with the debut's lo-fi production.<br>  8. I like to listen to them at night when it's cold out. On headphones.<br>  9. No<br>  10. All their studio albums, 3 live albums and the box set.<br>  11. They are very, very hard to find.<br>  12.

It was a masterpiece and one of the band's best.<br>  05. 'Under the Bridge'. It changed my taste in music. And it's also my favorite song of all time.<br>  06. By the Way. So overrated!<br>  07.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers, it was their first album and some of the songs are okay but most are quite bad.<br>  <br>  7. Emit Remmus, I've never liked the instrumental side to it.<br>  <br>  8. On the go listening to them on my iPod so I can hear each individual layer of guitar work.<br>  <br>  9. Yes I've seen them a number of times, last count was 5... Mainly just when they played in my area or at festivals, the last one was at Leeds Festival in 2007 which was their last gig of the SA tour.<br>  <br>  10.

I would change my moon to Aries because Capricorns with Aries Moons are said to be more outgoing than the typical Capricorn and won't stop until they get what they want.  I wish I was like that.<br>  <br>  If I had to change my Sun and Moon altogether, I'd go with a Taurus Sun/Libra Moon placement because Taurus and Libra are both ruled by Venus and people with this placement are said to be incredibly good-natured, kind people.  <br>  <br>  If I had to pick a Water sign placement, it would be Scorpio Sun/Virgo Moon because those with this placement are said to be sexy, yet earthy people.<br>  <br>  For Fire, I'd choose Aries Sun/Capricorn Moon because this placement is said to create a person who is headstrong but still rational and usually gets things done.<br>  <br>  If I had to choose an Air sign placement, it would be Aquarius Sun/Cancer Moon because people with this placement are said to be outgoing and social, but can still appreciate the comforts of being home.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Actual: Cancer Sun, Scorpio Moon<br>  Change: Aquarius Sun, Aquarius Moon<br>  Reason: I want to know what its like NOT to feel for a while.|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	My mum has Capricorn Sun, Scorpio Moon lol =]..I know what you mean..cos i know her well i can pick up on stuff..but still it's like you don't know what she could be thinking....(and 1 of my closest cousins has Libra Sun Capricorn Moon)<br>  <br>  Anyway,<br>  <br>  Actual: Capricorn Sun, Cancer Moon<br>  <br>  ChangeForAYear: Scorpio Sun, Leo Moon<br>  Reason: I would still like that emotional side & water in me..but the Leo Moon would prevent me for being too sensitive.. And it would be interesting to try a Fire Moon.. And the mysteriousness of Scorpios..|`|SjD1aKT5aa	I'm: Scorpio Sun, Taurus Moon .. there opposites so basically my personality and emotions are about the same.<br>  <br>  Change: Scorpio Sun, Sagittarius Moon.. I'm absoultely crazed over Sag's and I have a lot in my chart. There very bubbly, loving people and I'd loved to experience how they react to things because I know a lot about some are like my cousin and one of my best guy friends. I love my sun so wouldn't change it.<br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|VHxZuaOfaa	Wouldn't change it but i if had to it would be <br>  Aquarius sun<br>  Aquarius moon<br>  Idk why it would be so much funner it be so much more uniquer then everyone else <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  mines is actually Aqua sun Cap moon|`|AA10197672	Would not change to any...|`|9XR3wqtcaa	Actual: Scorpio Sun, Libra Moon<br>  Change: Leo Sun, Aquarius Moon<br>  Reason: I'd be more fun and outgoing, less emotional. I have a Virgo rising (I know you didn't ask for that), but combined with that and having a Scorpio sun, I overanalyze EVERYTHING and am always trying to figure things and people out. It drives me nuts. I'd probably be a little more charismatic and not come across as being so quiet and serious. I think Leo and Aquarius would be a fun combination :)|`|AA10562006	Well i definitely want to change my signs if i could.<br>  <br>  Actual  : CAPRICORN SUN & PISCES MOON<br>  Change: ARIES SUN & GEMINI MOON<br>           <br>  Reason: Well being what i actually am, a capricorn, is a bit boring, i am conservative, straight forword guy....not stylish, dogmatic and being pisces moon, i am very emotional and have mood swings, and am sensitive...but i am against all that...being aries i will be dominant, restless, brave and overall a Kool guy..and gemini moon, gives me a clever personality...i hate feeling mushy.....that of pisces moon...|`|wo1DGBo2aa	My actual star sign is Aqua, Moon is sagg, rising cancer<br>  the only thing I'd change is probably my rising sign...to leo or sagg...because I really hate how I act/behave when I meet certain people for the first time...I appear very innocent...and shy...even though I'm not like that at all....I just have this need to protect myself from the 'bad' that's out there/in people...|`|GpcbuAfmaa	I love my sun sign =] Aquarius! I think it's the best way to be<br>  <br>  My moon sign is Leo (such a contradiction I know) hmmm I wouldn't mind changing that to Gemini or Sagittarius <br>  <br>  but I dunno cause then I'd lose my polar opposite signs =[ I'm unique|`|J45b1wEkaa	Actual:i am a Taurus sun leo moon<br>  change:Leo sun taurus moon<br>  Reason: to be less emotional (taurus moon) and more outgoing(leo sun) although i am happy with my chart|`|3VKiFmMJaa	Actual: Cancer Sun, Scorpio Moon<br>  Change: Gemini Sun, Leo Moon<br>  Reason: All my favorite ppl are Geminis (sometimes I feel like a Gemini but my birthday is a Cancer). It seems like they get over things so quickly/easily and are so lucky and happy! ie Angelina Jolie, Heidi Klum, Adriana Lima. Leo moon b/c my emotions wouldn't be so deep!! A total change 4 me b/c it is so hard 4 anyone to understand me! I think maybe this would make life easier :-)<br>  <br>  OR Leo sun Scorpio moon..b/c my crush, the man I admire so much has this and I as cancer am alwayyys changing..it would be nice to be so stable and cheerful!

uhA17ApCaa	Have you considered applying to DENSA?|`|CfPQwq3Qaa	It doesn't really.  Thermoses use a layer of insulation in the way you insulate your home or a cooler insulates a cold pack and food.  In a house the insulation doesn't create heat, it just keeps it in and keeps the cold air out and vice versa in the summer.  The thermos just maintains the temperature of the substance longer.  Some thermoses use a substand to insulate, others (like some flasks) just use a pocket of air.  So, you actually have a sort of cup within a cup.|`|VRitcj2Taa	you must tell it before you put liquids in<br>  dont do as i did and put tea in to keep hot<br>  then put an ice cream in to keep cold<br>  what a mess ...not as clever as i first thought.lol|`|RdWTvI2raa	That is one of the many mysteries of life.

m4PtEEDNaa	...it was scary in a sense that the horrors which afflicted the characters in the film, were not directly shown to the audience, with regards to exactly what was terrorizing them; coupled with the 'realism' of the camcorder filmmaking style (...the pre-promotional 'faux documentary material, definitely helped, as well), the filmmakers wisely chose to let the audience use their imagination, in this respect, and that made things all the more chilling...<br>  <br>  ...I remember going to see this film, in the theater for the first time, and when the credits rolled and I got up to leave, a heckler in the back row shouted out, "...man, that wasn't scary!!  They didn't show anything!!".  From my writer's point of view, and having quite a vivid imagination to boot, I immediately thought to myself, "...do I REALLY want to know what happened to them?".  My mind would fill in the blanks, and come up with something so horrific....something that could not have possibly have been conceived, nor could have possibly been shown on the screen....that I felt yet another cold chill down my spine, even before I walked out of the theater.....|`|waGFlfRUaa	When I first saw it, I was really impressed with the style and it was somewhat scary. But, I tried to watch it again, and found it rather boring and tedious. It is the kind of movie you can only watch once or twice in a lifetime... Basically, it is not really that good, in fact, "Blair Witch 2" was better and more fun to watch...|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Yes! I saw the film when I was only 9 and i was so convinced that it was a true story until i when online and saw that it was "in fact" FAKE, but i have only seen it once, so i must say YES!|`|bPZlpe0taa	Not really because nothing much happened|`|77d0e6ce90c816f67f90982c2b7d3082aa	Yes.it was scary.If you feel the situations & atmosphere in that film it was damn scary.Gore-hounds or other slasher movie lovers will find that movie boring but not for me.Blair witch project is a love it or hate it type of movie.Black & white effects makes it more realistic.|`|cVBSsbodaa	I thought it was terrifying when I thought that it was actual film that was found in the woods, like I was told. After I found out that it wasn't, I don't find it to be scary any more.|`|y1hH8UtQaa	I am a big horror fan and no i didn't think it was scary- my friend gets scarred by anything and sat through it without a problem|`|BJIo6twUaa	Nope, i didnt think it was scary, found it more boring and didnt like the way it was filmed.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	not really.....At the beginning it was a little suspenseful, but after a while it just got boring...|`|Y8ndHCQ0aa	Nope it was stupid and boring to see the f**** shaking camera ;)|`|FJyLVazVaa	No way!  Waste of time, I kept waiting for something to happen.|`|P1QW4n0xaa	Not really.I thought it was good but not scary.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Stupid movie.  Sorry I watched it.  Waste of time.|`|HyUE9ON0aa	It was more exciting than scary.<br>  <br>  I liked it but have only watched it once, it is not a kind of movie you watch more than once.<br>  <br>  Blair witch project II was garbage.<br>  <br>  <br>  There was a movie called Bare Wench Project which was an unrated movie with the same story except the girls for some reason didn't wear much clothing.

Niygpxktaa	Firstly;<br>  Excellent Question<br>  <br>  Your first option carries much truth, although I suspect few will admit it. <br>  One need look no further than this very section to find evidence of the veracity in such a statement.<br>  <br>  Your second option completes the chicken/egg conundrum.<br>  It is interesting in it's subjectivity, because many a fool thinks himself intelligent.<br>  <br>  For me, music is just that...music.<br>  I can find a dope beat with minimal lyrics just as entertaining as the wittiest rhyme.<br>  I don't feel the compulsion to be enlightened by every verse I hear, and certainly not to the point where I express disdain for any emcee who doesn't .<br>  <br>  EDIT: @ Mechanical - your response starts out strong but falters at the end.<br>  There is more than one form of knowledge, and accordingly, more than one way to educate.<br>  A wise leader understands  the value of reaching all segments of the masses, and thus appreciates the value of a Jeezy as well as Talib.<br>  Do you disregard a demographic because they prefer their lessons on pen and pad as opposed to a computer screen?|`|HL8W9yU6aa	"Too much knowledge it might break up the rhyme, I did it anyways just to wake up the mind"<br>  Killah Priest<br>  <br>  I think we're not prepared to enjoy music with K.O.S. or B.I.B.L.E. lyrics from an entire album...<br>  We know that too much consciousness can get rather monotonous at times, MC's know damn well they're not gonna sell much, and at the same time you're right, some artists dont agree with the conscious label.<br>  I really like some deep thought out songs, but it'd be too much to expect that from an artist all the time, because, these lyrics well thought out, i dont wanna see them drop an album every 4 years instead of 2.|`|lMOXHh45aa	yeah that was me who said that... i got it from somebody else though lol when i said that though, i was talkin about those people who get all uppity on folks with they nose in the air like "i dont listen ____, i listen to people like Nas and Mos Def, etc" as if that really mean somethin about how smart they are... which infers if you listen to somebody lesser than that standard (and once again, music is primarily a form of entertainment), then you're dumb... with that bein said, I guess I'll go with Number 1  <br>  <br>  EDIT: and Mechanical made a *HORRIBLE* stereotype by saying jeezy fans only care about the rims on their car and going to the club, don't forget that culture plays a big part in people's listenin tastes too... i got friends at morehouse and spelman that graduated at the top of their class, but'll get just as ignorant as the next person in the club... it's their entertainment lol|`|q4XUy0Duaa	That is genius!  <br>  <br>  I would have to go with #2 (intelligent people like intelligent music).<br>  <br>  I don't know about #1, because I don't see it happen often.  I can't see someone with minimal intelligence listening to intelligent music because the lyrics would just go over their heads.  I love intelligent lyrics, but the lyrics don't necessarily have to be conscious.  I get bored with hearing the same lyrical content over and over again, regardless of what it is.  I'm impressed with any emcee who contributes something new to the game.  For example, Necro's track, Dead Body Disposal.  I'm not a big fan of this guy, but I never heard anyone go into detail about how to dispose of a dead body.  It's interesting to hear, and you never know when you might need this type of info.  I would love to get a K.O.S. lesson from every track, but there's only so much that can be said, and I've gained more knowledge on the topic by analyzing and understanding myself than I have from any track.  That can get boring too.  And with the increasing amount of people with ADD, I'm surprised that the majority of people prefer listening to the typical commercial hits these days, because the rappers aren't saying much.  I'm assuming they just listen to it for the beats, which aren't very good either.  I think people should definitely educate themselves outside of music, and even school.  Going to college doesn't make you intelligent, and neither does the type of music you listen to.  I think most rappers don't want to be labeled as conscious because it's associated with being emotional and sensitive and that doesn't bode well for a rapper's image.  I think rappers also don't want to be labeled as a revolutionary rapper, because if they don't start a revolution, their words are worthless.|`|hA5m65Waaa	I have to agree with Mechanical.  Also I gotta add that the purpose of all music isnt too entertain, some actually try to educate..if thats so bad then this generation lost<br>  <br>  Did 2Pac, Ice Cube, Nas, and many other rappers not do both? Yall act like "educating" is limited to book smarts|`|rzLGCrlfaa	well i guess i kind of fall into both categories i failed pre algebra 3 times but i can explain to you how a worm hole works even tho a worm hole is just a theory and has never been put into practice and i would love to learn something with every song i hear but lets be realistic its not going to happen|`|yoVF60ORaa	I don't think there are many people who fit your first theory, those kinds of people usually listen to the mainstream ****, whereas I probably fit into the second.  Not to brag, but I was salutatorian of my high school class, and am on full scholarship at university, and I am a hip hop purist.|`|1qUokeKOaa	i like ur number 2 i hate dumbed down lyrics i like lyrics that make me think lyrics so challenging that i have to listen to them like 3 times to figure them out|`|hwKFm7H8aa	I think the reason that I like "conscious rap"  is because I can understand and relate to it.|`|u8hsZ7claa	I must agree with Mech on this...sorry stupid is as stupid does|`|9DnsnEyraa	I haven't read any of the other answers yet because I just saw this question, but I am completely in line with your thinking. (too often I come into RHH and ask questions as such, and leave empty handed, so hopefully I can be apart of the discourse :)<br>  <br>  -I would say I listen to "conscious" hip-hop because I feel like I am an intelligent being that desires to learn more. I love hip-hop and there is plenty of it that combines entertainment and "k.o.s" in a way in which speaks to me. Maybe it's my generation, maybe it's my love for music, but for my entire life, music that held messages that I did not correlate my life with (bi**hes, h**s, etc), was simply music I refused to listen too.<br>  <br>  -Second, I love hip-hop because it is a wonderful genre of music, but as it turns into a genre that is commanded more by corporate CEO's and less by the artists themselves, I find myself listening to it less and less. This comes strictly from the fact that I do believe we as humans are lacking intelligence because of all of the distractions that tell us how unnecessarry k.o.s is (i.e. tv, radio, movies, commercials, etc).<br>  <br>  -There is some wonderful critical theory that speaks on entertainment in general as something that removes our intelligence. It's a bit far fetched, however, it is still very relevant in our "gimme gimme gimme" generation; we consistently CRAVE entertainment. ( Horkheimer and Adorno saw the culture industry as an arena in which critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture was identified as a reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. (Horkheimer and Adorno)<br>  <br>  -Ok, I love your question SOOO much. I'm glad I had the opportunity to talk on this. But every song def does not need to be a k.o.s track. Sometimes I can listen to "candy shop" in peace :)|`|oMYGtqubaa	2...  is DEFINITELY the BETTER answer....    I<br>  <br>  I think in the 'golden age'.... the GREAT thing was that 'conscious' artists FIRST priority was having great beats... and dope rhymes.<br>  <br>  So, even though Public Enemy was droppin' knowledge... the beats were CRAZY!!   I mean 'Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"  has just a ridiculously dope beat.<br>  <br>  So, at that time... Public Enemy just did what they did... it didn't have a label... Remember... Big Daddy Kane wasn't conscious.. but he did make political and social statements and ALOT of rappers did that... so, when you heard  KRS-One...  it wasn't so foreign to hear when somebody was always droppin' knowledge.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe today... we might be getting back to that...  since Jadakiss made it okay for hardcore rappers to make statements again...  even Young Jeezy (as much as we are cracking on him) is making them...   so hopefully a Talib Kweli CAN be played on the radio without people thinking twice about what he's saying.|`|VclnZhSCaa	I just like dope beats and rhymes.<br>  <br>  I don't listen to hip-hop for any other reason than that, and I'm sure a very LARGE demographic feels the same way. I can think of myriad more appropriate art forms to acquire information.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, and you misused "their".|`|gUYcVXMTaa	Morning Cap!<br>  <br>  First off very good question!  I have to say both!  I know so many stupid people that think there are smart cuz they listen to Common or Talib or Mos Def.  And Im like dude you are not smart cuz of that.  I got to the point where we were having a conversation about Obama and he brung up Commons verse like yeah Common said it best when it had nothing to do with the stimulus package.  I was like what the hell you talking about LOL!!!<br>  <br>  But with me I will listen to all kinds of music mainstream underground different genres and all so if I am listening to a mainstream album once it is over I feel I need to pop in a more "intelligent" artist!  After listening to someone rap about money hoes jewelry and clothes I need something to make me a bit more grounded....if that makes sense :)<br>  <br>  I think every quality song should leave you feeling like you just learned something new about the person/artist.  Even if it is just as small as a glimpse into there life or as big as a history lesson.|`|T3X7Aci4aa	I just want to comment on reason #1<br>  <br>  1. People Lack intelligence and like to live through intelligent music vicariously (Basically, You're stupid and use intelligent music to feel smart)<br>  <br>  I'd rather see people ignorantly follow intelligence than see people ignorantly follow stupidity. Not everybody is a leader. The leaders have to guide the followers along the right path. If someone can't (or doesn't want to) develop their own intelliegent ideas, I'm more comfortable with them learning from Talib Kweli than Young Jeezy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Darqwon...your point would be valid if the average Jeezy fan cared about more than just the rims on their car and going to the club.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Aim...I didn't say there's anything wrong with enjoying those things. There's something wrong if that's your #1 priority. I'm aware that I'm stereotyping Jeezy fans, and my stereotype is true.

It's like rockstar overload...it was even used on a furniture/sofa shop advert (DFS probably) for some dodgy reason - it has nothing to do with furniture|`|pLPKo6mBaa	That's one of the few Nickelback songs that I can tolerate, but I can't tell if it's supposed to be serious or satirical or half-serious and half-satirical or what.<br>  <br>  What do you think of this parody of the song? It's called "Popstar". :P<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uSlqI1AVUk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uSlqI1AV...</a>|`|AGP2dI6uaa	I hate everything about Nickelback.<br>  <br>  I like watching this video of them getting rocks thrown at them and getting booed off the stage in Portugal:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQzhOyHTarU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQzhOyHTa...</a>|`|B30tksvbaa	I used to really like it, but everybody just got obsessed with it and sang it everywhere and now I really don't like it.

E2VUH8Q0aa	Absolutely. You can either take the midpoints of the two charts and do a horoscope based on that, or you can take the synastry and compare that to the transits in the near future. <br>  <br>  There are even some places on the net that do joint horoscopes.|`|AA10181139	You are putting the cart before the horse. The charts reflect reality - they are a symbolic representation of it. Couples have choices about how they react to events and to each other - and the charts reflect this - we still all have choices about how we react to other people - we can go positively with our charts and try to work with the tensions and use them as stepping stones to make progress and develop as individuals and as one half of a relationship.<br>  <br>  One example is Mars - you describe Mars transits as if they are negative - anger and aggression? But Mars also energises, starts new enterprises, is highly-sexed. Without Mars in our relationships they would be boring with no new initiatives and the male sex side would be absent! Charts and astrological knowledge can show us how to work at relationship problems and grow within those relationships instead of feeding off the negativity - but it takes all four elements to do it. Earth for being practical, Fire for the spirituality and true love, Water for emotions and how to deal with them and Air for communicating with our loved one. <br>  <br>  Don't blame negativity on the charts - astrology is a key to knowing oneself.
Z5mmaFK0aa	Hello Tron!<br>  <br>  Hmm... They are decent. I do not like the vocals that much. I mean when it comes to death metal there are A LOT of people that say they sound all the same but they don't. In death metal if I don't like the vocals I can usually ignore them and focus on the music. However, there are certain vocalists I cant like the low low DM vocals in Defeated Sanity and Lord Worm in Cryptopsy. This guy is okay theres just something about his style I don't like. Death Metal has grown so much there are just THOUSANDS of DM bands these days. But in the genre there are those DM bands that sound unique even though they may have the common characteristics of the genre. Aggressive Vocals, Blast Beats, Complex Riffing ect. My point is these guys are talented hands down but to me they sound like a handful of several other DM bands. With the Thousands of DM bands you have to fuse other things in the songs, other genres of music including metal. There are so many sub-genres now in metal that artists should get acquainted with them mix them in their style and set themselves apart from the ordinary metal band. <br>  <br>  These guys look and sound like Youngsters so they have a lot to learn with regard to what I am talking about. I have been there and done that same thing so I understand. It seem when your really young you want to sound like everyone else or your favorite band. I am guilty of that as well as you know. With my music I try to experiment with other sub-genres and elude away from the traditional DM sound. I mean I still use trademarks like the Pinch Harmonic bends. The Bizarre off time and technical riffs, all the diminished modes. But then I will through some killer groove in there, some flamenco guitar, do something a little like Opeth or something just something to be different. <br>  <br>  Anyway, these guys are good and talented but they just sound like a handful of other bands to me. Good find though|`|cbZdeOSPaa	Nice! I personally liked their song Warth of God...thanks for sharing!|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Experimental kinds of metal are really overall iffy for me. I can either love it or I can hate it. This band was pretty good, they didn't try to be too weird or different which was good. Weird and different is good but only to an extent.<br>  <br>  The vocalist kind of reminded me of Max Cavalera which is definitely a good thing since Max Cavalera is one of my favorite vocalists. Although, it wasn't exactly like him, which is definitely a good thing cause he has his own voice.<br>  <br>  I liked them a lot, nice find dude!|`|aYNoQvfMaa	Impressive technically, but ultimately fall into the same place many death metal bands fall into; repetitiveness. I didn't hear anything truly that progressive, certainly nothing I haven't heard before in death metal, but still a pretty good band, much like cephalic carnage in this regard.|`|d4besXrYaa	They sound awesome.<br>  Also take a look at Enslaved, The Faceless, Arsis, Athiest, Cynic, Born of Osiris, and Opeth.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Nice pull<br>  <br>  F'kin badd@$$<br>  <br>  Keep 'em comin<br>  <br>  I eat this sh!t up, whether or not I have time to answer like I want!!|`|RwDLRgxtaa	ok, though they are retarded children compared to<br>  <a href="http://myspace.com/valornyc" rel="nofollow">http://myspace.com/valornyc</a>

He pretty much came across the same way on SNL.  If he hasn't changed by now it's unlikely he'll ever improve.  <br>  <br>  I don't dislike him, I just don't think he deserves to graduate from the SNL cast just yet.  Not even Chevy Chase could keep his late night show going for more than 5 weeks and he's a comic genius.  <br>  <br>  Likely network standards have fallen, severely, and maybe SNL cast members just can't seem to do a talk show.|`|Le53Bggxaa	I like him, I think he's funny but I didn't like much in SNL, because I felt like he always stares at the camera for too long/too much; and he kind of chuckles...it really annoys me.<br>  <br>  And so far he's been doing the same thing on the Late Night show. I'm serious, I'm not sure its just me though, but he keeps keep glancing at the camera...you'd think he'd learn to be more subtle about it.<br>  <br>  But Oh well. Hopefully it'll get better in time.|`|iwHplt8saa	I think he did great tonight, compared to the last two.<br>  Awkward and nervous.<br>  <br>  This night's episode was awesome! Really entertaining and there was no "Deer in the headlights" action.<br>  Though I wasn't one of those who saw the first episode and said "We want Conan back!!!"<br>  <br>  I never saw him on SNL though.

A phenomenally successful instrumentalist whose recordings make the pop charts, Kenny G's sound has been a staple on adult contemporary and smooth jazz radio stations since the mid-'80s, making him a household name. Kenny G is a fine player with an attractive sound (influenced a bit by Grover Washington, Jr.) who often caresses melodies, putting a lot of emotion into his solos. Because he does not improvise much (sticking mostly to predictable melody statements), his music largely falls outside of jazz. However, because he is listed at the top of "contemporary jazz" charts and is identified with jazz in the minds of the mass public, he is classified as jazz. <br>  <br>  Kenny Gorelick started playing professionally with Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra in 1976. He recorded with Cold, Bold & Together (a Seattle-based funk group) and freelanced locally. After graduating from the University of Washington, Kenny G worked with Jeff Lorber Fusion, making two albums with the group. Soon he was signed to Arista, recording his debut as a leader in 1982. His fourth album, Duotones (which included the very popular "Songbird"), made him into a star. Soon he was in demand for guest appearances on recordings of such famous singers as Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, and Natalie Cole. Kenny G's own records have sold remarkably well, particularly Breathless, which has easily topped eight million copies in the U.S.; his total album sales top 30 million copies. 1994's holiday album Miracles and 1996's Moment continued the momentum of his massive commercial success. He also recorded his own version of the Celine Dion/Titanic smash "My Heart Will Go On" in 1998, but the following year he released Classics in the Key of G, a collection of jazz standards like "'Round Midnight" and "Body & Soul," possibly to reclaim some jazz credibility. <br>  <br>  Faith: A Holiday Album was released that same year, followed up by a limited edition re-release of the 1997 Greatest Hits disc. 2002 found Kenny G dipping into tropical territory with Paradise, which featured guest appearances by Brian McKnight and Chanté Moore. This was followed by a music video collection, another holiday album, entitled Wishes, and, in 2003, a second greatest-hits collection, Ultimate Kenny G. Perhaps in a bid to shake up his discography a bit, in 2004 Kenny G released At Last...The Duets Album, which featured "duets" with LeAnn Rimes and Chaka Khan. Two years later, smooth jazz's king of the soprano sax returned to a purely instrumental approach on the brassy, big-band-inspired albums Holiday Collection and I'm in the Mood for Love. 2006 was also the year the artist was dubbed the best golfer in music by Golf Digest, beating out Vince Gill for the number one spot. In 2008, Kenny G released the Latin-inspired Rhythm and Romance. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide <br>   Answers.com ▼ <br>  Home Page <br>  Browse <br>  Personalize <br>  Print page <br>  Email page <br>  Translate page <br>  WikiAnswers.com ▼ <br>  Home Page <br>  Browse <br>  Recent questions <br>  Search Help Search unanswered questions...     <br>  Browse: Unanswered questions | Most-recent questions | Reference library Enter a word or phrase...

Kenny's main instrument is the soprano saxophone, but he also plays the alto and tenor sax on occasion.<br>  <br>  In 1981 Kenny G signed with Arista Records as a solo artist. He has released many solo albums and collaborated with various artists including Whitney Houston, Toni Braxton, Natalie Cole, Steve Miller (which marked the only time he appeared on a rock and roll album) and Aretha Franklin. Influenced by the likes of Grover Washington, Jr., his own albums are usually classified as smooth jazz.<br>  <br>  As of 2003, Kenny G was named the 25th-highest selling artist in America by the RIAA, with 48 million albums sold in the USA [1]. In 1994, Kenny G won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition for Forever in Love. He also has a substantial worldwide following.<br>  <br>  While Kenny G's entry into the smooth jazz market remains popular with the American buying public, he has come under fire from music critics and jazz devotées, leading him to be described as "the musician many jazz listeners love to hate" [2]. As one example, social networking site Facebook as of October 2006 contained five groups against Kenny G, and one in support, with membership in the negative groups running ten times higher.<br>  <br>  Guitarist Pat Metheny's criticisms of Kenny G are especially well documented, as first printed on Metheny's own Web site forum in 2000, and archived on Jazz Oasis.com [3]. Drawing Metheny's extreme ire was Kenny G's overdubbing of a song by legendary jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong, which Metheny described as follows - "By disrespecting Louis, his legacy and by default, everyone who has ever tried to do something positive with improvised music and what it can be, Kenny G has created a new low point in modern culture - something that we all should be totally embarrassed about".<br>  <br>  English guitarist Richard Thompson seconded Metheny's thoughts by writing the song "I Agree With Pat Metheny, Kenny's Talent's Are Too Teeny". Among the song's pointed lyrics are:<br>  <br>  In the 1993 movie Waynes World 2, mention is made of Kenny G. Garth Algar then imagines himself in a theatre audience, having his teeth drilled by a dentist as an unseen performer plays a saxophone solo. It is, however, mentioned in the closing credits that the saxophone solo was not played by Kenny G.<br>  <br>  Kenny G was featured in a 2000 episode of the animated South Park, called the World Wide Recorder Concert.<br>  <br>  On Reel Big Fish's 2006 live DVD, You're All In This Together, Singer-guitarist Aaron Barrett criticises trumpeter John Christianson for playing a "Kenny G" solo during "Where Have You Been", and is ordered to play a more "Rock N' Roll" solo.<br>  <br>  In Friends " The one where they're going to party" Ross says "And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!" To which Joey replies "we're twenty nine we're not women!"|`|HAOYxM1paa	i heard he looks like Jesus Christ.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	The only thing I know about Kenny G is that he is Not jazz. I don't know why he's even mentioned in this section.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Glad you like him but other's really don't. (yes I'm one of them). He's regarded as a bit of a musical joke, sorry :-(|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I checked out from the library recently his "The Essential Kenny G" cd.  It's 2 discs of his hits, and there's a sentence or 2 of what he thinks of each song.  If you want to hear his style over the years it would be in this cd collection.<br>  <br>  Also, over the Christmas holiday, I like to check out a lot of Christmas cds, and was surprised to see that he has 4 different holiday cds.  Although most of them say they're holiday music, it's mostly Christmas music.  There are some singers/musicians who do more than 1 Holiday cd, but he did 4....that may be a record number for a musical performer.  He must like Holiday/Christmas music a lot!  So do I.|`|sdP1qmCKaa	everything you need to know about Kenny G is contained in this Pat Metheny interview :  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jazzoasis.com/methenyonkennyg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jazzoasis.com/methenyonkennyg...</a>|`|YkseyT7zaa	Plays Alto sax and not properly (right technique)<br>  Holds the record for the longest note played<br>  Love to play golf|`|h1IYS0dbaa	I couldn't say it better than Pat Metheny<br>  <br>  Not long ago, Kenny G put out a recording where he overdubbed himself on top of a 30+ year old Louis Armstrong record, the track "What a Wonderful World". With this single move, Kenny G became one of the few people on earth I can say that I really can't use at all - as a man, for his incredible arrogance to even consider such a thing, and as a musician, for presuming to share the stage with the single most important figure in our music.<br>  <br>  This type of musical necrophilia - the technique of overdubbing on the preexisting tracks of already dead performers - was weird when Natalie Cole did it with her dad on "Unforgettable" a few years ago, but it was her dad. When Tony Bennett did it with Billie Holiday it was bizarre, but we are talking about two of the greatest singers of the 20th century who were on roughly the same level of artistic accomplishment. When Larry Coryell presumed to overdub himself on top of a Wes Montgomery track, I lost a lot of the respect that I ever had for him - and I have to seriously question the fact that I did have respect for someone who could turn out to have such unbelievably bad taste and be that disrespectful to one of my personal heroes.<br>  <br>  But when Kenny G decided that it was appropriate for him to defile the music of the man who is probably the greatest jazz musician that has ever lived by spewing his lame-***, jive, pseudo bluesy, out-of-tune, noodling, wimped out, ****** up playing all over one of the great Louis's tracks (even one of his lesser ones), he did something that I would not have imagined possible. He, in one move, through his unbelievably pretentious and calloused musical decision to embark on this most cynical of musical paths, **** all over the graves of all the musicians past and present who have risked their lives by going out there on the road for years and years developing their own music inspired by the standards of grace that Louis Armstrong brought to every single note he played over an amazing lifetime as a musician. By disrespecting Louis, his legacy and by default, everyone who has ever tried to do something positive with improvised music and what it can be, Kenny G has created a new low point in modern culture - something that we all should be totally embarrassed about - and afraid of. We ignore this, "let it slide", at our own peril.<br>  <br>  His callous disregard for the larger issues of what this crass gesture implies is exacerbated by the fact that the only reason he possibly have for doing something this inherently wrong (on both human and musical terms) was for the record sales and the money it would bring. <br>  <br>  ** <br>  <br>  This is the song:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJePNFkkvFk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJePNFkkv...</a><br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  Kenny G sucks even more than Paris Hilton!

AA11899483	well i would think venus in aspect to pluto to get that manipulative vibe. i have venus in scorpio conjunct pluto and my ex had venus in cancer trine pluto. i admit, i was abit manipulative with him, he was the same. it was like because of my overprotective, jealous streak. i am very possessive, but thats because i give my all into relationships and that turns into possessiveness. both cancer venus and scorpio are jealous and possessive, but because we have it aspected to pluto its turned up a few notches.<br>  <br>  5th house aquarius would be what you find pleasures in, unique original things, or things you like doing for fun, things that no one else would, friends social gatherings.  whereas mars in aquarius would be how one asserts themseves. in aquarius it means they go after things in an original and unique approach. they are all about freedom and and love being independant and different. if his mars is in aquarius that means his mars could fall in your 5th house in aquarius in syanstry. this is what i got from a site . . <br>  <br>  "Mars in partner's fifth house produces strong romantic attraction of a sexual nature. The Mars person may be very sexually demanding and impulsive in pleasure-oriented activities. There is apt to be a lot of competition associated with this relationship." <br>  <br>  that itself could indicate what your trying to say. but then again dont forget it is other aspects that would indicate this, and the aspects his planets make to yours and where eachothers planets fall into your houses.|`|AA11263103	horoscopes are faker then Pam Anderson's  boobs|`|Ow3O7h4caa	His Mars in Aquarius makes him somewhat contentious,  unyielding with a lot of nervous energy and a good capacity for work although, a good deal of impulse that is apt to work erratically.<br>  This person isprompt and decisive both in speech and action, but sometimes a little brusque and abrupt.<br>  Under good directions, thisperson isvery devotedtohisfriends or cause tht is greatly valued but under bad directions, he will suffer much through these same friends or associate and may lose them or be alienated by difference in views. He needs to be cool and prudent and learn to give way gracefully to others. Not an easy job.<br>  <br>  Aquarius in the 5th house is ruled by Uranus, so expect unexpected and sudden events. You will have romance in your life and some strange experiences may come to you through the opposite sex. You can expect some difficulty relating to one lover.  Uranus will incline you to original thoughts upon love matters, and will also magnetically affect others. The urge is to reach as many people as possible as quickly as possible so that continuous interpersonal communication is achieved.<br>  This is not the most romantic sign to be on the 5th cusp. The orientation is much more toward friendship than for unending, intense passion.

As the priest is walking on the beach, the parrot shivers and says, "Ooh, it's ******* cold out here!"<br>  At that instant the priest is shocked and he walks back to the pet store to return the bird. He says, "I cannot keep a bird who speaks such profanity in the house of God! How can I stop him?"<br>  The clerk says, "Just grab him by the feet and twirl him around 3 times and put him back on your shoulder. That will shut him up."<br>  The priest thanks the clerk and he leaves the store. On the beach once again, the parrot says, "Ooh, it's ******* cold!" so the priest grabs him by the feet and he twirls him around 3 times and puts him back on his shoulder. This time the parrot says, "Ooh, it's ******* windy too!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One day three men are playing golf. One is American, one is Japanese and one is German. When the German swings his golf club, his phone rings and he excuses himself. He then proceeds to hold his thumb up to his ear and his pinky to his mouth. When he is done talking, the Japanese and American look at him like he is crazy. He says, "Oh, this is the latest technology. I have an earpiece implanted in my thumb and the microphone is in my pinky."<br>  The Japanese and American nod and look at each other and they continue playing.<br>  After the American swings his club, his phone rings. He excuses himself as well and he proceeds to cock his head to one side so that his ear is making contact with his shoulder. When he is done talking, the German and Japanese are looking at the American like he is crazy. The American says, "Oh, this is even later technology. I have an earpiece implanted in my shoulder and the microphone is imbedded in an artificial tooth."<br>  The German and Japanese nod and look at each other and they continue playing. The Japanese swings his club and then his phone rings. He excuses himself and he pulls a roll of toilet paper out of his golf bag and he proceeds to the bushes. The German and American look at each other and they follow the Japanese to see what he is up to.<br>  When they look in the bushes, they could see the Japanese squatted down with the roll of toilet paper shoved up his ***. The men ask, "What are you doing?"<br>  The Japanese responds, "I'm waiting for a fax."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A white man sees a Haitian tribe in the jungle. He consults the chief and he says, "I would like to join your tribe."<br>  The chief replies, "But you are white."<br>  "I know that, but I would still like to join."<br>  "Very well. There are 3 tasks you must perform. First, you must drink this here bottle of white man whiskey. Second, you must go into that cave over there and kill a bear with your bare hands."<br>  The man gulps and says, "But I might get killed! Oh well."<br>  The chief proceeds with saying, "And third, you must rape a white woman."<br>  The white man says, "That seems easy enough." He grabs a bottle of whiskey and he downs it all. He is now piss drunk and they take him to the bear cave. The man walks inside and a few minutes later the sound of screaming, growling and the tearing of skin can be heard. The man staggers out all battered, bruised, scratched and bloody. He then asks, "Now, where's that white woman I have to kill with my bare hands?"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Those are the only ones I know for now.

2FNfyxVqaa	I use to like the Fab 5 but in the last two episodes I really do think they are just being big bullies and letting the Ambers get to them for no reason. Yes, I do think the Ambers are SUPER annoying but it is a double standard when it comes to if the Fab five do something and if the Ambers do it it would go to a whole other level. I think they are letting their egos get to them and the fact that they outnumber the Ambers.<br>  <br>  Ailea is the worst of all. She is a little punk that only suddenly gets big because she has the girls on her back. I can't stand her. She is a punk, and fake. She wants everyone to think she's some "BAD girl when the only thing she's bad at is men."<br>  <br>  Ashley. When did she get involved in this whole battle? She needs to stay out of it.<br>  <br>  Sara, she's whatever.<br>  <br>  Tiffani, I am so disappointed in her!! She use to be my favorite Bad Girl but now she's acting really immature. She's obviously the leader of the Fab Five so she's letting it get to her head.<br>  <br>  I really don't think thought that any of them will have to leave the show. The show ends I do believe in like two weeks because Oxygen network has a new show starting at that time slot, so it'll be pointless for them to get kicked. My guess is that the producers will step in and say bla bla bla you can't fight...they might get kicked out and they will end up ending the show all "DRAMATICALLY"|`|xl5uQj3daa	I agree Amber b  should have helped Amber m and I hope she presses charges on those itches|`|ZgAgGlWHaa	I used to like the Fab 5, well that least three of them because Aliea has always got on my nerves. It is amazing that she is tough when the other girls are around but she never tried to to be tough chick when Kayla was there. And even though the Ambers were very annoying, Amber M.  did not deserve the beating she  got and where was the other Amber? I hope the girls get arrested because people need to know that violence doesn't make you a bad girl , it makes you a stupid girl.|`|a1d7539ac2479c53542542eef301b5dbaa	Fights was entertaining but also dangerous!!!|`|arjB50zBaa	Well, I agree with you 110%!!<br>  Poor Cookie didnt deserve to get jumped like that. I know she is not innocent  but she has not treated those girls like they are treating her.<br>  Tiffany is just, a *****. She acts like a gang leader,lol.<br>  Sarah, well she is just a Hoe and proud of it.<br>  Whitney is the biggest hypocrite of them all she claims to have such good morals and yet she acts this way. She is just a punk...from Boston,lol.<br>  Ashley...Please I can not imagine what world this girl is in or what she is on because she is the farthest thing from pretty. Any man that is paying her bills like she says has to be on what she is on or just ugly as hell.<br>  Aleia, O' dont get me started I cant stand this chick. She talks so much sh!t but only wants to fight when someone is holding her back. I cant stand this messed up chick. I think she is the most messed up  I think she needs a Physciatrist Pronto!!!<br>  Amber B she talks alot of smack and is obviously insecure but has not stooped to the "fake five" level. Cookie seems the most real, she has managed to stand up for herself, stand her ground and stick up for her friend and try to maintain a level of friendship with the other chicks.<br>  I do hope she presses charges on them for beating her down and leave them skanks in a mexico prison,lol|`|vuCo9wZZaa	I completely agree.  While the Ambers are annoying, they are annoying like a fruit fly.  You can choose to ignore them, whereas Ailea, Whitney and Tiffany are seriously deranged.  The way they went after Amber M (who is what, 90 pounds) and beat her up while she is on the ground is just crap.  AND Amber B clearly isn't such a good friend because she was no where to be found and didn't help defend Amber M at all.  Coward.  <br>  <br>  And Ashley and Sarah losing the contest was great.  I couldn't believe that Sarah said she has never lost a bikini contest before...maybe she's never entered one before?<br>  <br>  I hope Whitney, Ailea and Tiffany end up in jail and have to go to anger management and get kicked off the show and fined.

955YoHvVaa	He's not the father..he needs to back off and let Billy be a father to his daughter..in all fairness Billy didn't even know about the baby being his so he has NO right to start crap with Billy...Billy is trying to do the right thing now and Cane has to but in and prevent it..is he out of his mind to think that he has any claim to this baby and to ask Lily to raise Delia with him..he has lost his damn mind..Be like most other guys and just back away when you know its not your child..and go have one with the love of your life, Lily..and let Chloe and Billy be together.|`|AA10093245	Chloe didn't want a baby, all she wanted was to trap a Chancellor for money. she is selfish and greedy. <br>  Cane is trying to re live and fix his own childhood through this baby I think. <br>  I just wonder what's going to happen when they all find out Jill is not a chancellor, which means cane and billy aren't either.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	Nope but he is so corrupt, that he is lashing at everyone in sight.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I am not liking Cane.

Now that Chloe has had her kid where are all those who have been saying Lily is too soft and should be more like Dru?!!

xoxXq3w5aa	I see you are confused. And you confused me too, but I managed to get this out of your question. <br>  <br>  Yes something broke in Moroni's leg or ankle when Batman dropped him. He doesn't need a cane to just stand up properly (I didn't notice it). Yes it looks like the bus barely hits the guy and you are correct about the body not being there when the Joker and the one who was driving started packing. <br>  <br>  I usually notice most of the mistakes and it usually bothers me, but it didn't bother me with The Dark Knight. Great movie.|`|zetxxZWUaa	There is always going to be some editing mistakes, but it didn't ruin the movie. And no you don't have to have a cane to stand properly even though it would take some of the pressure of the broken legs, yes he broke a leg when he was dropped. You can hear it snap if you listen carefully.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Broke an ankle from the fall, not both his legs.|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	Maroni probably just sprained his ankle.<br>  .
L1qQBNbbaa	I hear Ya Buddy she was hot i was 14 years old the first time i saw Oola and it made the ewok in my pants jump. Something sexy about those Togruta and Twi'lek women.<br>  <br>  Oola was a Twi'lek dancer in Jabba the Hutt's court. She was the daughter of a clan chieftain on Ryloth and tricked to becoming a dancer by Bib Fortuna and Jerris Rudd as a gift to Jabba. She was also the half sister of Nolaa Tarkona, the leader of the Diversity Alliance. <br>   <br>  Oola in her dancing outfit.She and Sienn'rha (another Twi'lek) were trained together as dancers at one of the greatest dance schools on Ryloth. As they were in Mos Eisley on their way to Jabba's Palace, Luke Skywalker ran into them and attempted to set them free. He killed Rudd and rescued Sienn, but Oola wanted to see what Palace life was like, naively thinking she would be able to leave at any time. Little did she know that it wouldn't be what she expected. Fortuna took Oola, and succeeded in giving her to Jabba. <br>  <br>  Rather than the customary dancing veils, Oola was given only a flimsy net costume to wear, loosely held together by narrow leather strips. Jabba was immediately enamored with her, and chained her by the neck to his throne as his personal property and slave girl. Oola was forced to dance for him, as well as give pleasure when the depraved crimelord beckoned, but she was determined to escape from her horrible existence, one way or another. <br>  <br>  Defiled and miserable, fed only on scraps, she could not decide if it was better to keep enduring the Hutt's carnal embrace until escape was possible, or to die cleanly and well, and escape that way. Oola chose to refuse Jabba's advances at least once before her final dance, and was thoroughly beaten by his Gamorrean guards for this act of defiance. This beating was conducted "scientifically", so as not to leave her with any disfiguring bruises. <br>  <br>   <br>  Oola defies Jabba.Later that day, Oola was able to speak briefly with C-3PO, who told her that Luke was indeed going to return to rescue them, and her hope was renewed. Her spirits high for the first time since her imprisonment, Oola performed the best dance of her life—unfortunately, she had aroused Jabba with her performance, and he dragged on her chain, beckoning her to him once more. <br>  <br>  In the end, Oola chose honor over life, and refused to submit to Jabba's request. As she hauled back on her chain and pleaded with Jabba, he became angry and tugged harder, bringing her over the trapdoor in front of his throne. She was eaten alive by Jabba's rancor after Jabba dropped her into the rancor's pit. Her legend, however, would live on in the form of impersonator Dame Needa, who put on a nightly Oola tribute show at the Gardulla Oola hotel and casino in Mos Eisley. <br>  <br>  edit Behind the scenesOola was portrayed in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (in both the original release and in additional scenes filmed later for the Special Edition) by actress Femi Taylor. Remarkably, she looked almost unchanged after 14 years, allowing for a close up of her looking in terror at the rancor. <br>  <br>   <br>  Oola faces Jabba's rancor.Oola's right breast pops out of her costume right before she falls into the rancor pit, and is briefly visible; however, body makeup doesn't allow for details to be seen. It can be briefly seen when the scene is played in slow motion. <br>  <br>  Oola is one of the characters announced in the as yet unnamed Star Wars live action T.V. series. <br>  <br>  I was disappointed not to see any sexy female teenaged Wookies in the newer trilogy|`|bPZlpe0taa	I think Leia will always be the most beautiful|`|n583S1uZaa	Princess Leia Organa portrayed so exquisitly beautiful by Carrie Fisher in"Star Wars Episode VI:Return of the Jedi"(1983)She was stunning!Now if you still got doubts about my answer,take a look for yourself!:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leiabikini.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leiabi...</a>|`|EZf00NJJaa	Natalie  Portman & Keira  Knightley<br>  <br>  Princess Amidala & The Decoy .|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Yes, Oola is the best.

50dfad07d8ee2b10b7bb6c48c0f62037aa	Um....we either explode into tears and get all dramatic or we do it as politely as possible.<br>  <br>  I think it is better just to confront him and sort this out.<br>  <br>  However, I do have one question. How long have you been with him?<br>  <br>  I remember giving you advice on how to deal with him.<br>  <br>  Also, if you really liked him why didn't you follow the advice I gave you before?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Yea, I think you pissed him off. Sit him down, tell him your feelings about him, and ask what you can do to make the relationship work. It is as simple as that. Expect some drama.<br>  <br>  Okay, what about this. When was the last time "you", not him, hugged him and said you loved him?<br>  <br>  I am curious as to how you complimented him as well. Like what exactly did you compliment on?<br>  <br>  Edit 2:<br>  If he is dealing with his own problems, then you should let him know that you will always be there for him when he needs you. <br>  <br>  Breaking up. Um...Libras won't and can't completely break up with you. Even if you break up with him. You will always be his special someone.<br>  <br>  We also have a hard time saying "No" to things if you haven't figured that out yet. So you can rephrase your questions to suit your needs. *Hint* *Hint*<br>  <br>  See? You got his attention by complimenting him. He started telling you about things. Simply put, Libras define love more verbally than others. We would prefer you to say things. Tell him you will support him. Don't think it.|`|NRhrO833aa	I'm a cancer as well, and I understand how you feel. Libras can also becoming obsessive, but more in a selfish way. They can pretend to be your friend, but they always have to make sure they have what they want first. Don't be fooled by his friendship. However, you might want to rethink this, since it's not always someone's sign. But if he's obviously screwing around with your mind, talking to other girls, not replying, apparently he doesn't want you around him? I'm sorry, but this sound's like a breakup to me. Just tell him your true feelings and how you really feel about him, and talk to him. If he still ignores you, Dump him first. Sorry I hope this helps.|`|cuIX13BKaa	Neglect constitutes abuse. It is time to cut bait. Your life is so precious. Complimenting another person when they are the ones making the mistakes is like saying "Thanks for hitting me, why not do it again?" ~ I was with a Libra for 2 decades...when it is time to leave...it is time. There is only ONE YOU! If YOU do not come first then no one else can.<br>  Time to say "Goodbye to this one...at least for now. Sounds as though he needs to evolve.<br>  <br>  <br>  Garbo|`|NV9FoM5Jaa	He doesn't call for a break up,he just simply doesn't return calls and starts ignoring you,like he is doing,this is his way of breaking it off.

He apologized for offending her and he was drunk, not good, but Dirty did it.  <br>  <br>  Macho needed to go, he had no respect and rightfully so, although he was worth some comic relief.

G3Xf0i0Eaa	T in the Park is just like any other festival when it comes to surviving.<br>  <br>  General festival-ness:<br>  <br>  1) Wellies - with all the vehicles going around the campsite its a mess - and make sure that theyre comfortable ones too<br>  <br>  2 ) Pain killers - your legs can really ache at times.<br>  <br>  3) Baby wipes - for when you're muddy and want to eat.<br>  <br>  4) Sun cream without a doubt - nothing worse than being sunburnt - and a light waterproof for the rain spells (when its still hot)..umbrellas really are not good for festivals!<br>  <br>  5) Torch - it'll be dark on the way back to the campsite and in your tent when the festival has finished<br>  <br>  <br>  The Campsite:<br>  <br>  1) You need your own toilet roll for the toilets - they get REALLY mucky in there (not the worst festival ones though). Also, on the toilet front - as soon as the actual festival area (not campsite) opens - run to the nearest toilets as they would have been cleaned the night before so you can gaurentee clean toilets..<br>  <br>  2) big bottles of water - for things like rinses tooth brushes/mouth after brushing your teeth - or just generally drinking from as drinks can get expensive.<br>  <br>  3) Make sure you wrap up warm at night if in a tent as it can get pretty chilly - and sleeping on a hard floor, frozen, doesnt do too well for a nights sleep.<br>  <br>  4) Get there the earliest you can - you may get an email or something asking if you want to upgrade to Thursday camping for free - do it!! And arrive thursday - the later you arrive, the further away you need camp from the festival entrance (it can be a good 2 or 3 miles if you're really late)....... and NEVER set up your tent anywhere near the toilets!! Stay a good 10 metres away!<br>  <br>  5) Personalise your tent so you can find it - you may think you've got the most unique one - but there is bound to be 10 others in an area just like it - so personalise it yourself - and remember where it is as when you come back to it, you'll probably find someone who wasn't there in the morning has sent up camp right next to yours between the lines that hold the tent up...<br>  <br>  <br>  Going home:<br>  <br>  1) Pack everything up the night before - and leave fairly early-ish (7 or 8 ish, depending on how your leaving) as it can get busy!<br>  <br>  2) Their shuttle system is really good - pretty crowded though. Make sure your bags obviously belong to you - as they'll all get muddled up with everyone elses on the bus/coach so you've got to be able to find it all. Also make sure you dont have 100 bags otherwise you're bound to forget one :P<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also - if you have forgotten anything - there will be loads of shops in the campsite - and they generally have everything needed for camping!|`|KDNWFuZWaa	waterproofs and wellies the first couple of years I went it was not too bad then the mud just seemed to be there every year after that. Also get over your fear of peeing in public places have the time you never get to the toilet and mostly they are blocked. Leave all valuables at home and don't leave anything in your tent if you are camping.|`|sK8ZhTahaa	Get Tangerine fields to do your tents and sleeping bags for you, they have security in the field so no worries about thieves and the toilets are cleaner.

A lot of people think Chef Ramsey is extremely harsh, but I love him!  He's one of those guys that you either have to love or hate.  Anyway, it drives me crazy when there are incompetent people in the kitchen (like this season's Colleen), but I love watching contestants when they're "on fire."  It's great getting to see them excel.  As of now I don't have a favorite, but I'm sure I will with in a couple of weeks.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	As a chef I can honestly tell you I don't treat anyone in my kitchen the way I've seen people treated on Hell's Kitchen. I also can tell you it's a very bad idea to be that nasty to someone who is holding a knife.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Yes, it's just like that. Being in the restaurant business I can relate to what goes on. Not an easy job working in a kitchen, or being a chef. Hopefully, people will realize that when they watch these shows!|`|f31fac4f3be7141334887486f8dcf112aa	i do i LOVE how chef give yell out funny names at them at the dinner service. nightmares is really good my me scared to eat at resturants though|`|MqJ3VgK0aa	Omg i do its hilarious...!

The alligator was much stronger than the father,<br>    but the father was much<br>    too passionate to let go. <br>  A farmer happened to drive by, heard his screams,<br>  raced from his truck,<br>   took aim and shot the alligator.<br>  Remarkably, after weeks and weeks in the hospital,<br>   the little boy survived.<br>  His legs were extremely scarred by the vicious attack<br>   of the animal. <br>  And, on his arms,<br>   were deep scratches<br>   where his father's fingernails dug into his flesh in his effort<br>   to hang on to the son he loved. <br>  The newspaper reporter<br>   who interviewed the boy<br>   after the trauma,<br>  asked if he would<br>   show him his scars.<br>  The boy lifted his pant legs. And then, with obvious pride, he said to the reporter, 'But look at my arms.<br>  I have great scars<br>  on my arms, too. <br>  I have them because<br>  my Dad wouldn't let go.' <br>  You and I can identify<br>   with that little boy. <br>  We have scars, too. <br>  No, not from an alligator,<br>   but the scars of a painful past. Some of those scars<br>  are unsightly and have<br>   caused us deep regret. <br>  But, some wounds,<br>  my friend,<br>   are because God has refused<br>  to let go. <br>  In the midst of your struggle, He's been there<br>   holding on to you...  The Scripture teaches that God loves you.  You are a child of God.<br>  He wants to protect you<br>   and<br>   provide for you in every way. But sometimes we foolishly wade into <br>  dangerous situations, not knowing what lies ahead. The swimming hole <br>  of life is filled with peril - and we forget<br>  that the enemy is waiting to attack. <br>  That's when the tug-of-war begins - and if you have<br>   the scars of His love<br>   on your arms,<br>   be very, very grateful. <br>  He did not and will not ever let you go. <br>  Please pass this on<br>  to those you love... <br>  God has blessed you,<br>   so that you<br>   can be<br>   a blessing to others. <br>  You just never know<br>   where a person is in his/her life and<br>  what they are going through. Never judge another<br>   person's scars,<br>  because you don't know<br>   how they got them... <br>  Also, it is so important that we are not selfish, to receive the blessings<br>  of these messages,<br>   without sending them<br>   to someone else. <br>  Right now,<br>   someone needs to know that God loves them,<br>   and you love them, too -<br>  enough to not let them go . <br>  Always<br>   Tell Your Family<br>   And Friends<br>   How Much<br>   You Love Them!!!|`|ET3Da336aa	2 make it stand up u wet it, 2 make it wet u lick it 2 make it stiff u suck it 2 get it in the hole u push i slowly...

mrvBIUbEaa	If your a girl, Mars represents the type of men you are attracted to; conversely Venus represents the type of woman you are and how you exude yourself outwardly in sexuality.<br>  <br>  If your a guy, Mars represents the type of man you are, Venus describes your ideal woman.<br>  <br>  My Venus and Mars are both in ARIES. <br>  <br>  I have the same. Mars in both houses. Let's see...I like macho men, but not meat heads, the type that will throw me around passionately, rough play if you will. I like all kinds of people, but my fantasy is- well proportioned muscular bodies. YUM! I want a man's MAN. Someone who will not be embarrassed by showing chivalry, and still have manners. (this is how I fancy a man).<br>  <br>  My Venus suggests that I'm not too shy with handling rough situations. For example, I've always wanted to shoot guns. Angelina Jolie has her Venus in Aries as well, so she has no problem playing with arms. I like vigorous sports and when it comes to sexuality--I'm ravenous! :D <br>  <br>  We're ardent lovers.<br>  <br>  These aspects are said to have downfalls as well, Venus in Aries is volatile. She can be seen as being self centered and impatient.|`|tFcsLR7Maa	oooh you're a fiesty one just like me. I've also got Mars in aries.  To top the icing on the cake i've got Aries In my 7th house. If you've got that to then you're candela !!!  (  on fire ) <br>  <br>  Venus Is the planet of love <br>  Mars the planet of aggresion<br>  <br>  Aries is a dominant sign. Their natural born leaders. I once dated a Aries In Mars/Venus. He was controlling, possesive, intuitive, jealous & demanding. He wanted things his way. I'm the same way too. <br>  <br>  In love you're probably really controlling, super hot headed, U don't let nobody walk all over u, not a lover or a friend. You stand up for what you believe in.  You tell it how it. Aries are really blunt and straightforward. That might turn some people off  (the ones that can't handle the truth) Others ( like me ) will LOVE it ! In sex you might be the type that likes it rough and likes to be slapped around a little ! Aries are super arguementive and confrontational ! <br>  <br>  Goodluck !|`|XONUN5H2aa	Love 'em and leave 'em.

I bet if I played that now I could sing every song word for word xD<br>  <br>  But anyway, um... Don't like either, but I'll go with... You know what I'll go with the Jonas Brothers. I think everyone around here hating them so much has made me more inclined to like them. Hahaha.|`|yS61H04haa	Dear god... they both make me want to stab myself in the ears with an AIDS infested ice pick.|`|8zcD3flPaa	Boo Jonas Bros!

Everyone embraces RageATM because of their musical politics.  So why pick on Bono...LOL!  Sure, he may wear thousand dollar sunglasses but when he's not touring or writing with the band, he & his wife actually go to poor countries and actually stay there for months getting their hands dirty working with the locals to make that community better by helping them build fresh water tanks, ice boxes and other means for vegetation to better that community.  He does this with his own money and the uses the money from his 'one' foundation to help other causes such as aids.  He's not just all talk, he DOES something besides just write a check.  He goes to these places and makes a personal difference and we all know he doesn't have to do that.  That's just the kind of person he is.  He uses his position in the media to better those whenever he can and that's commendable.  He is nowhere near being 'self-righteous';  it's just the media wants us to think that.  You know the media, the people who will film children being slain and instead of putting down their frigging cameras to maybe try and help save the life of one of the these innocent children; they'll just keep filming and let the innocent die and then want us to believe Bono does what he does for 'brownie points'.  No, he does it because he cares and I'm glad he uses the media when he can.  They do more damage and he does more good.  Now, if he (and band) would just get back to their musical roots and start making good albums again, then THAT would be great; but if helping out foreign lands in need by actually living right there with these peoople makes him feel like he's making a difference; it's only because he IS making a difference and GOD BLESS HIM!  For real self-righteaousness; Courtney Love and David Lee Roth seem to be the king & queen of self-rightousness, imho but they get the coverage they used to get.  Maybe because they DON'T 'get their hands dirty' to get clean running water to every human possible.  Like Bono is trying to do.  :)  Peace|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Rock star wannabe?

He seems to have a huge ego and one gets the feeling he does it as much to make himself look cool and feel morally superior as opposed to actually caring.  I *hate* self righteous people...can we please be in favor of worthy causes without acting like you're better than other people?|`|IA123dWLaa	no, you're missing it. at least he GOES to the depressed areas of the world.

hQ95u9OLaa	Parker and Stone, I think fall into a new classification that maybe Kentucky Fried Movie started. It's not really satire or screwball. It's a kind of throwing out a net over a boat and all the fish you catch are the jokes that work. Lots of them don't but a lot do. Caddyshack, Meatballs, Ghostbusters fall into this category. Airplane is a biggie. The Simpsons and Family Guy and King of the Hill and South Park all fall under this category. <br>  <br>  The comedy is really funny but the satirical points are sometimes really broad. Like on Southpark when Cartman ended up feeding the kid's parents to him for supper. It's not slapstick or satire exactly but it's sure as hell funny. And sometimes it is satire; but the targets come out of nowhere. And it's very raunchy comedy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps if for no other reason, gives you something to consider.|`|TGWETA8caa	Satire, comedy is the best I could go with it. <br>  What about a cult movie?
cuIX13BKaa	Great question. Libra women are ethereal and dreamy. It is known as the most beautiful sign of the Zodiac. Any man would be fortunate to snag a Libra and what men do not understand is just how precious Libra women are. Let's face it that most men need to be taught how to treat any of us and Libra will not stand for being stood up or to have promises not kept. Another Libra is always an interesting combination though they have a tendency to be somewhat selfish. Virgo men think they are knights in shining armour and can be pretty stuck on themselves. Scorpio men to the lovely Libra woman need to realize that she is always son a honeymoon and there is nothing wrong with that. Scorpio can be selfish until it is pointed out to them that they are not the star of this relationship. Cancer men have a lot of insecurities and love the air signs, but can they be faithful? They must be shown that Libra is the boss and her bidding will be done. Strangely Capricorn men are wonderful partners as they are made of the 'politics' of any given situation. Capricorn men express themselves wonderfully and have wonderful humour. They can be counted on to be lavish wherein Aries I have found to be stingy and this is one case where though opposites may attract it is that Libra's air to Aries fire and testosterone ultimately comes to an end as she is weary of fanning his flames and retreats to the sanctuary of another sign that listens. Leo men find the ethereal Libra enchanting, but does Libra feel the same way? Most often not. Sagittarius is a fun sign for the Libra woman as it stimulates her sense of beauty and culture and these can remain friends for all of time. Gemini men if they are listening early on really do get the message and never want to see a relationship end making great life partners or friends. Libra Rising is the MOST lovely of any of the Rising signs....they re the most besutiful. Any of the signs might prove me wrong however this is my experience. Remember it is all in the stars!<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|7sXNwFynaa	flirtatious, teasing,  though friendly , diplomatic and calm|`|QZzQdh43aa	Everybody seems to like Libra Ascendant natives. They just come across as nice, pleasant, and fair. Look a little closer at their lives, and these nice people may have had quite a few problems in their relationships. Some of them have had a string of relationships, and it can be hard to imagine why! These natives attract others to them effortlessly. Besides, they simply don't know what to do with themselves without a significant other.  <br>  Libra rising generally appear to be smoothing everything over. They have charming smiles, a gentle approach with others, and an easygoing image. Even if they were not endowed with good looks, they are attractive. Most pay a lot of attention to their personal appearance -- the colors they wear, their hair, the way they walk. <br>  <br>  Libra rising people can be enormously persuasive, although they will almost always use a "soft sell" approach when they want to win others over, which is all of the time! A tendency to pass the buck and keep up that "nice guy/gal" image are their worst qualities. However, they can make excellent mediators and will generally be the first to accommodate you.  <br>  <br>  Libra rising natives are usually attracted to competent, active partners. Their relationships are often characterized by bickering or competitiveness until they learn to drop their sweet image once in a while and to stop blaming their partners for everything that goes wrong.

60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	Well, for one thing...it's a VERY long movie.<br>  But, one of the greatest Steve McQueen movies you'll see.<br>  <br>  If you've already seen it then you know it's about a U.S. Navy gunboat (The Sand Pebbles - or The San Pablo), an ancient relic of the Spanish American war heading down a tributary of the Yangtze River in China in 1926 at the start of the Chinese rebellion and what the American crew encountered when hatred for America in that region was growing rapidly as the crew found itself in hostile waters.<br>  <br>  The story revolves around the arrival of Jake Holman, played by Steve McQueen, a maverick and a loner whose only love is engines, who poses a shipboard challenge to the Sand Pebbles and their skipper. <br>  <br>  Also starring Sir Richard Attenborough and Richard Crenna as the Captain.<br>  <br>  I could tell you more, but I won't...just see it.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	McQueen was screwed.

On the heaven side, unbridled passion will attract you to each other. Initially, physical bonding is very strong — it will make both of you long for each other even from the outset.<br>  <br>  In most cases, two Scorpios fall in love with each other very quickly, and soon realise that there’s a possibility of a lifelong commitment.<br>  <br>  Another Scorpio instinctively understands your mind and heart, from the inside out. You can share your secrets with them. Often you won’t need to say a word to each other — a look will be enough for you to know what the other is feeling. You have a certain synchronicity, and you won’t need the endless discussions many relationships need. Their very presence is comforting.<br>  <br>  Relationships between two Scorpios are not what other star signs would consider idyllic, because there are often tremendous upheavals and intense mood swings due to both sides’ inflexible position on many issues. If neither of you is capable of loving the other unconditionally, these problems will not be easy to overcome.<br>  <br>  Because you love so deeply, you’re possessive, jealous and suspicious of each other. You both demand undivided loyalty, and this could eventually stifle you.<br>  <br>  If neither of you rises to the occasion and allows the other some personal freedom, the relationship will turn into a battle of wills and a sticky web of emotional complexity. The only way out is to trust each other and not give way to your suspicions. This could be one of your most important karmic lessons.<br>  <br>  Scorpios born between 24 October and 2 November are instantly attracted to you. Their sexual appeal will be heightened as a result. Once you become involved with them, you could find yourselves joined at the hip because there is such a close resemblance in personality.<br>  <br>  Probably the best combination with another Scorpio will be with those born between 3 November and 12 November, who are partly ruled by Neptune and Pisces. These Scorpios provide you with pretty much everything you need to feel as if you’re in the perfect relationship. They’re idealistic, and believe that the most important thing in life is unconditional love.<br>  <br>  You may have a gentler and more emotional relationship with Scorpios born between 13 November and 22 November. This is because the Moon and Cancer filter through their personalities and bring out the very emotional side of your nature. They are soft, caring, and very family oriented. If it’s family life you’re after, these Scorpios will be ideal for you.|`|e4h5yVXgaa	I don't know... but what I do know is it's going to be the BEST sex of your short-miserable exsistance.

Alright. Lay down on the floor and breath. Notice what moves up and down. Your stomach. When you are standing up, you normally breath using your chest and shoulders. When you lay down, your lungs have the ability to take in more air. Right before you sing take a deep breath of air, and tighten your abs. You project more while being able to steady your breathing. In sports, athletic trainers tell you to breath with your stomach because it helps steady your breathing. :D|`|nxuKLupUaa	When you are not thinking about it, you breath naturally from your diaphragm, which is what gives you the support you need. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Breath in. You should not feel your chest go up. This is the way you breath properly while singing. The breaths should be silent, not strangled or difficult to do. Another one you could do is lie down, and place a book on your stomach. Breath in. Your stomach will go up and push up the book. Breath out. The book should go back down. This increases your breath endurance. Good luck and I hope this helps!|`|8ygky5g4aa	You definitely need to do breathing exercises as part of your warm up.  Breath in to an 8 count, hold for 8 count and breath out for 8 is a simple way to warm up your lungs.  When you breath in and hold your breath, your breath should be at the top of your throat, not in your mouth and your lungs should feel full but not bursting.<br>  <br>  You can also do a breathing extension exercise where you breath in for 8 then take a small catch breath, then breath out to 8.<br>  <br>  Once you've done the breathing exercises then you should move on to your scales and other warm ups.|`|IgivEx1Vaa	Yoga

y8WBcehmaa	Grindhouse had one.<br>  <br>  and Watchmen doesn't need one|`|aeb8a97e18cfb4ff7d90a5aa9ca2331faa	The last intermission that I can remember in the movie theater was Scarface with Al Pacino.  They took a break just after he took over Frank's empire and just before the beginning of his downfall.  It was a great time to take a break in the movie.  Since that time most movies aren't that long that they need a break but something like Lord of the Rings went on forever (especially the last one) and really it could have used a break.<br>  <br>  I guess the theaters wanted to get more showings in per day and by having a break they weren't able to get as many showings out of a single film.  That's the only reason that I would believe that they changed that policy.  That's just a guess but it would make sense.  It could also be that the theaters didn't have reels big enough for the extra long films but I believe a lot of the intermissions were sent with the films too.<br>  <br>  It's worth researching the reason for the demise of the intermission.  I know they used to do that on HBO years ago as well, even the Godfather had an intermission.  Maybe the film directors also didn't want the continuity of their films interfered with so the film studios quit including them.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	The Dingleberries January 2009|`|l7E3EreXaa	Grind House with Tarantino & Rodrigiez I think.|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Gone with the Wind was the last one I could think of.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.
35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	Hmm i also think that she isn't dead i mean she's a very popular and important character, why would Kishimoto simply kill her off like this? And she hasn't had a good battle yet i think she's just seriously injured that's all or mabye Pain stabbed Hinata like how he stabbed Naruto.<br>  <br>  Well alot of people thought she was dead when Neji beat her up badly during their battle at the chuuin exam but no she's still breating and even it was said that Neji would die after his battle with that sound ninja (couldn't rmb his name) but he's still healthy.<br>  <br>  So my answer is no she will still be alive so is Kakashi.|`|ehF2XiMbaa	I don't know if its denial but I don't think shes dead. I'm completely sticked to that theory. What scares me the most is the big *** explosion Naruto made when he transformed...<br>  Kishi cant do this to us. And its not because of pairings but because of the amazing character she is.<br>  Whoever thinks otherwise is entitled  to their opinion; but their retards (And thats MY opinion, ***** :O).|`|X45rxI7gaa	Nope, because she is a major character in the manga, despite her role being relatively small. And fans have been talking and talking about NaruHina more than any other pairings in Naruto, go online and you find lots of fan pics of them, lots of fan fics, hentai manga of them more than other characters. Kishimoto won't be that cruel and piss off the fans|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	The real question is, if she is alive, how long will she last with a rampaging 6 tailed naruto?|`|Q8usj0hwaa	thats true. i saw the manga and i think she is only injured but i have to say that things were resolved when she was supposedly killed. so i dont know i dont want her to die and naruto was pretty pissed off too.|`|yap35HbDaa	She's still alive.

akcGfgdcaa	There's no length or time limit, as long as the production company owns the rights to the story or film adaptation rights, they can remake a movie at any time.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	A remake is just the same thing over again.  A sequel would continue from the previous movie.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter how long you wait- for example "The Ring" or many other remakes come out right after the original, but they are in a different language so they don't really compete with the original.  The Hulk also didn't have a very long time between the original and the "reboot" remake.  That series and the Batman reboots are not remakes because they don't copy the exact same stories, but they are remakes because they are based on the same source material!  confusing huh?|`|B43x5RF8aa	There isn't a certain amount of time that needs to go by. Whatever studio owns the rights to the movie can remake (or re-imagine nowadays) it anytime they want to.|`|d7qUDYNVaa	"remake" is politically incorrect now-a-days, lol, the term is "reboot" it's just a term filmmakers use so they don't feel like they are completely ruining the integrity of the original... to answer your question, there is no set amount of time. If studios think it will make money they will "reboot" any movie or series (ie, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Street Fighter, Karate Kid, etc.).|`|bPZlpe0taa	Well it can't be too far since they made the same hulk again after eric banas one
H5Spvghcaa	These books are great. After reading these books, you can gain a new frame of mind, about the world that you live in, and the people that you interact with. They also have great conversation starters, for parties, when meeting new people, at a new job, or on a date. These books allow you to see your faults and give you a way to change them. For example, What if you were the cause of global warming?<br>  This questions helps you realize that our earth is in trouble and you are a part of it. It can motivate you to become more "green" and by doing this you can save money while still helping our earth. Hope this helps.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Yes I own The Book Of If questions for the games of life and love.

Spankings worked a whole lot faster then those little easy consequences of doing wrong. <br>  <br>  My parents had 6 children, so they had to find the quickest and easiest way to make them all listen---and that was to spank them. It worked----people were constantly amazed at how well-behaved we all were whenever we were out in public. My parents were the best at disciplining their children. :)|`|7Ce2oC9Yaa	yes|`|IIC7jiVhaa	yes|`|e50801718f9fb2029899b7125a63f159aa	Not with the hand but with a belt!!|`|6E7Ebp1faa	im asian of course i was|`|HAOYxM1paa	not only spanked but beaten too. haha.|`|NKpZGdtraa	yuppers: belt,shoe, willow you name it I got it, hurt like a b!@#$ but I survived took one for the team|`|HT1Ng5yxaa	SPANKED???!?!?!?<br>  <br>  <br>  Dude, I was set on fire everytime I laughed....*cries*<br>  <br>  <br>  And beat with a tonfar........|`|5CiAFdbsaa	nah|`|GGTfQqsgaa	yep|`|WMoXGUccaa	No . <br>  <br>  My mum thought it was wrong <br>  <br>  Thankfully|`|U8DIvAetaa	yep. All the time.|`|95gVLrIGaa	Yes and still am.|`|ZrjGrFwzaa	Yes, and I now have blisters.|`|hSDWIslFaa	Yes.|`|aRh4FKUaaa	Yes! I was! Can you believe that?|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	yes. and I turned out to be a very disciplined, well mannered young woman. My parents were loving enough to discipline me when I needed it and I thank them for that!|`|PpWosZsIaa	Spanked with belts, shoes, bare hands, wooden and metal paddles, switches, and the list goes on.|`|C2sZREuAaa	yes with a hot cast iron|`|aKBqMLuhaa	certainly was, and I hold no grudge for it. <br>  <br>  I think its fine if someone doesn't spank but if that is the case than they need to be sure there is something besides yelling that they do for discipline. Because that produces a whole slew of other parenting/child rearing issues that need to get addressed properly.<br>  <br>  I have worked in children's services for 15 years, and much of that time was doing parent teaching and behavior management. And I support appropriate spanking.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	Spanked, slapped, hit, beat with a garden hose. Ah, those pleasant childhood memories.|`|wpqJr2FMaa	Very little when I was very young (around 3 or 4)<br>  But that's what got me to develop good habits later in life.<br>  So I guess I am going to say no.|`|AA11184902	yes|`|PtfaM7jEaa	only when i did something that put my life in danger|`|NBNLMRpRaa	Yes.

My mom busted a wooden spoon over my head and once threw her keys at my face and busted my nose. <br>  <br>  I have three kids of my own now and the most they get is a bare handed spanking about once a year or every 18 months.<br>  <br>  I think there is a big difference in how I was disciplined, and the way my kids are. I feel as if we were abused and assaulted as kids. My mom was a single mom with a lot of anger and emotional problems and if we misbehaved, all of her anger and frustrations came out on us.<br>  <br>  When we do spank our kids we wait about 5 minutes to let them think about their spanking that is coming and also to cool off some of our anger. They are all 5 and older so they can anticipate what is coming. I think that has been the greatest tool. They get scared of what is to come...but it doesn't really "hurt" them.|`|6npsRIzUaa	Sadly, yes. <br>  It was extremely unpleasant and made me scared of my parents hitting me at times.|`|8iHbDmHmaa	Not excessively, but yes.|`|Rp6cxboYaa	Yes, but only when I deserved it. And it worked.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	hell yea, and i turned out great!!!!<br>  we all should "spank" our kids just for the heck of it!!!|`|fLnXOGLIaa	Yes with a belt!|`|fsHgUrcAaa	Yes|`|mA59dkjXaa	Yes ;((|`|CMms2lGoaa	Yeah. My parents yelled and hurt me sometimes, too. :(|`|KqypHx4Eaa	By a girl teacher Yes.|`|fb5ac5faab424efb3d1e35f8fd315050aa	YES.|`|hwDtWCAjaa	i guess you could call it being spanked|`|bf0ed9359eff6a68cd92a93c7dd88745aa	never|`|AA11865684	yes<br>  <br>  <br>  (My Folks told me I could be anything I wanted in life...I chose to be an azzhole)

Even worse, what the sod does prettiness or popularity have to do with talent?<br>  <br>  Vacuous question if ever there was one!|`|jeYi7APraa	Emma is prettier...<br>  but Kristen is cooler...<br>  :D|`|0Tst4RJ2aa	emma emma emma....................NOT <br>  <br>  Kristen is sooooo much cooler i think!|`|yig566gEaa	Stewart|`|UeGbG8Axaa	Emma Watson, i like them both, but i like Emma best.|`|uUuZr4uZaa	kristen stewart|`|3Les3n24aa	They're both bangin'|`|v8V6aUPwaa	I hate Kristen Stewart. She doesn't have any talent what so ever. She didn't get the part in Twilight fair. Her dad got it for her.<br>  Emma Watson can actually act. She's got talent.<br>  And to me Emma Watson is prettier. Kristen Stewart can only look nice if she's got make-up on and stuff. Emma Watson has natural beauty.|`|CfPQwq3Qaa	I think that Emma Watson has had more acting experience, but it has been limited in scope..playing the same character.  Whereas Kristen Stewart has varied a little.  Still her roles are all still very similar.  So, time will tell.  I think they are equally pretty.  It's a tie.|`|anibDCRXaa	STEWART acts better and is better lloking and she doesn't have that accent Watson has.|`|kvSZdzZFaa	Emma is prettier but I like Kristen better!!! :))|`|XNEh9GVlaa	wow i like both of them but i would have to go with emma watson:) i like her acting in the harry potter movies;!

jUg9HAOjaa	Well,<br>  <br>  Fist of all, I don't listen to the judges when I don't agree with them.<br>  So the ones I think were the best or had the most potential are the following.<br>  <br>  1. Lil' Rounds. ****She has a great voice and stage presence.<br>  2. Ju'not Joyner.*** Good voice, really liked his song.<br>  3. Jorge Nunez.*** Good voice too and good song choice.<br>  4. Kristen McNamara. *** She can really sing, all she needs is help in the wardrobe department.<br>  5. Taylor Vaifanua. ** She was pretty good.<br>  <br>  Didn't like Von Smith, he kept changing the tone of his voice, that wasn't pleasant at all.<br>  <br>  Scott Macintyre wasn't too bad, but very forgettable. I really hope he doesn't make it, there's already Michael Sarver as a spoiler.<br>  <br>  I loved Kendall Beard's voice at first. The beginning of her song was quite beautiful, and then it went all thin and shrill, it's like she was two different people...too bad.<br>  <br>  Felicia Barton, really struggled with that Alicia Keys song. I wasn't much impressed.<br>  <br>  The rest of them were either forgettable or terrible.<br>  <br>  That show was slightly better than the previous week; my favorite so far is still Alexis.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I liked Lil Rounds, Jorge, Ju'not, and Kristen<br>  <br>  <br>  Pop tart, I answered your question a few minutes ago, its This Ones For The Girls by Martina McBride|`|vD5ucs24aa	Most def!!!!! i voted for her and ju'not i think he had a really good voice a mix between lyfe jennings and john ledgend. and lil rounds was just AMAZING!|`|AA11111233	Felicia Barton, Kristen McNamara, Scott McIntyre|`|pSgKRP8jaa	I loved it!

bS5cGrVgaa	It's not about getting "thinner" it's about getting healthy. For some people it's a lot harder than just "losing weight" some people make it sound so simple. If it was that simple, why isn't everyone skinny? there are some skinny people who are extremely unhealthy...and they are some "fat" people who are super healthy (i'm not talking about morbidly obese people, that's never healthy, just overweight) I'm what you would call "fat" but i am in great health, great cholesterol, great heart, great lungs, i have lots of stamina and can keep up with everyone else...me and hubby go hiking all the time and i don't have any troubles. I eat right and i exercise...but i'm still overweight (weigh over 200 lbs) i lose weight VERY slowly. I don't eat red meat, candy,soda,junk food, or fast food. We eat a natural organic diet...and i drink at least 80 oz of water a day... But i only lose like a lb or 2 amonth, sometimes none. I just don't have high metabolism. I have a friend that weighs 115 soaking wet and she eats TONS of food...candy, soda, fast food, you name it, doesn't even know what water is lol...and she NEVER exercises....you try and tell me that she's "healthier" than me....|`|aLwrpMPXaa	NO.|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	i believe people should be comfortable with who they are..if that means losing weight, then so be it|`|qY9svA3taa	Well it depends how fat.

Cancer is a far more emotional sign than Aries, as its water element implies.<br>  <br>  However, the positive in this combination might be your ability to inspire others. It could well be a boon to shy and reserved Cancers. You can motivate them to take the initiative and explore other possibilities.<br>  <br>  Your mission with a Cancer, in terms of romance, will be to be very responsive, because Cancers are extremely receptive and sensual. Both Aries and Cancer are cardinal, movable signs of the zodiac. This indicates flexibility and adjustment and a need for great variety in both of your lifestyles. But always remember that the Cancerian creature is far more retiring and home-loving than you.<br>  <br>  Your blistering enthusiasm, which is like a souce of pure energy that is always turned on, will overheat the cool and watery Cancer. Result? A rather steamy affair. Now steam is fine when it comes to matters of physical intimacy. In fact sexually it’s most desirable. But a steamy fog or lack of clarity on an emotional and mental level is a different matter altogether. This is where the difficulty between the two of you lies.<br>  <br>  Cancer, like Marg Simpson of The Simpsons, requires an undemanding, stable, nourishing home life. Aries, on the other hand, is more like Homer Simpson — far less willing to settle down. You need variety in love, and Cancer might be a little too staid — perhaps even boring — for you on a long-term basis. But don’t give up — Homer and Marg Simpson seem to keep it together even though Homer is all over the place most of the time!<br>  <br>  If Cancer is able and willing to give you the freedom you require, this partnership is quite likely to work. The chances are best if you were born in the last portion of Aries, between 10 April and 19 April. This is because Jupiter is an influencing planet for that period, which means that you will thoughtfully accommodate the domestic needs of Cancers.<br>  <br>  Those Cancers born between 22 June and 2 July will be far too sensitive for your Arian power.<br>  <br>  The best choice appears to be the Cancers born between 3 July and 13 July, who are partly ruled by Mars, Pluto and Scorpio. You can expect powerful love connections with these individuals. This is because the Scorpio vibration resonates strongly with your sign, as it too is ruled by Aries. You’ll find a tremendous karmic connection with these Cancers.<br>  <br>  Those born between 14 July and 22 July are not likely to completely satisfy your need for immediate and spontaneous activity; they are too idealistic for you.<br>  <br>  If you are an Aries who doesn’t mind a lot of quiet time in front of a cozy fire, the home-loving Cancers born between 21 June and 3 July are perfect for you.|`|AztCTaQlaa	going by the normal behavior pattern I've seen (including my own interactions) the cancer will love you for a while but get bored and think of herself (be a bit of a drama queen).<br>  <br>  (but we were REALLY good in bed =(

F60JZOU3aa	History<br>  <br>  The history of the show started in 2000 with Harmony, Rhapsody, Barnaby, Elf and 4 Tots. The producers of the series made two straight to video releases. The creator of the show was inspired by her daughter's obsession with glitter and fairies.<br>  <br>  The producers replaced the actress of Harmony, the golden fairy, and Elf. These two characters were replaced by younger looking adults. The little tots were also reduced to three. These changes were done to boost the popularity of the show as a multi-million dollar 26 part television series that was in production. In November 2005, The Fairies came to television for the first time, airing on the Seven Network in Australia, going into a 9am time slot.<br>  <br>  The Fairies was made more realistic and magical, making it more like a fantasy drama for children. New Zealand-based WETA Workshop (the outfit behind the special effects used in King Kong and The Lord of the Rings) designed the sets. Also, the actors were replaced, except for Elf. Harmony, who was the Golden Fairy, and Rhapsody, the Rainbow, were also changed into more 'girly colours'. Elf and Barnaby's costumes were also changed. Elf looked more 'Elfy' and Barnaby lost some of his legs. The tots costumes and actors were also revamped, now making them more cheeky, and dressing them to look more sophisticated.<br>  <br>  Season One of The Fairies was repeated in April 2006 on the Seven Network, going back into the 9am time slot.<br>  <br>  In 2007, The Fairies' second TV series was produced, and aired on the Seven Network from 23 April. With two new characters, Bubbles the Beach Fairy and Twinkle the Tooth Fairy, the magic of the concept continues. Sales of the DVDs in Australia have now topped 100,000 units, and the international market is looking on the concept as one with many, many legs.<br>  <br>  The show is filmed in Adelaide, South Australia at the South Australian Film Corporation Studios.
0FSe88Veaa	The secret is that Alice sees bella becoming a vampire and when James comes she sees it more clearly because James bites bella and Alice doesn't see Edward come so that is why Edward glares at her in the scene in the garage because edward doesn't want to take bellas soul and Edward glares at alice in other parts of the book because alice sees bella changing into a vampire and Edward is determined to keep bella human so he knows that there is another reason she will become a vampire and he doesn't want that to happen but alice sees it so he know it will eventually happen and that is why new moon is the way it is I don't want to give anything away is you haven't read it yet|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Please go ask this in the right section. Twilight is neither a comic nor animation. This is a book so go ask it in books and authors.|`|sBQvubj5aa	Perhaps you should put this in polls and surveys or movies and you would get a better response but i think it is something to do with her past and how she was treated.

[=<br>  <br>  <br>  xoxox|`|zDBHHWkSaa	The secret Alice has with Edward is not what James revealed in the end.  If you read Midnight sun, it shows you that Alice has forseen Bella becoming a vampire, and nothing changes it.  Edward is often angry because nothing he does can change the fact that Bella is destined to become a vampire, and that's what he's always giving Alice looks for.|`|ZN3T2bF2aa	how about asking this in the right question,, b/c quite frankly know one here cares. this is called the comics and animation section 4 a reason. last time i checked that meant ppl asked questions that were related 2 comics and animation, not about some gay book about sparkling vampires. somebody might actually answer ur question in the book and aruthors section where this question belongs.|`|CLtfFEqWaa	Sweets, wrong section!<br>  Please move this question to Books and Authors.<br>  You will most likely get more good answers there then yelled at here.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?( ?ヮ?)?[?.·′?.·′¨¤ Ayase Sensei ?.·′?.·′¨¤]?( ?ヮ?)?<br>  ?( ?ヮ?)?[?.·′?.·′¨¤ Hope I helped! ?.·′?.·′¨¤]?( ?ヮ?)?|`|H0LPCjIRaa	She's really Alice from Alice in Wonderland|`|OHTeRwSuaa	If you read the part of Midnight Sun on Stephenie Meyer's website, this makes more sense. It's also mentioned in Twilight, but very breifly. <br>  <br>  Alice has seen a vision of the future. She knows that Edward is going to fall in love with Bella even before he does. She sees three things. One, she and Bella will become good friends. The other two depend on Edward's choices. Either Bella will die, or she will become a vampire. <br>  <br>  Edward doesn't want either of those last two things to happen. That's why he seems mad at her sometimes. And, as for the secret, he's definitely not going to tell Bella about this vision. <br>  <br>  Alive doesn't even know about her past with James until she sees the video, so that's not it. :)|`|dxBmIGpjaa	i think it's just how he can hear her thoughts, so every time she thinks something he doesn't like, he tends to glare at her. also (if i'm thinking of the right part!) it's because he knows she is right, and he will have to put up with it <br>  <br>  hope it helps =)|`|rkb4qW4caa	Alice used to be in an asylum where a vampire worked. The vampire freed Alice and turned her into a vampire. He turned her into a vampire because the vampire knew James was after Alice.|`|U5WMlZxpaa	It's both actually. The first secret that they try to hide from Bella is that Alice has already seen her change. Then later, James reveals Alice's past in an asylum that she didn't remember.|`|dbgKOaE9aa	Its because Alice is Edwards favorite sister and they are really close to each other.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe someone somewhere thinks you are dead ugly.|`|M9EcpbmDaa	he's not 'so ugly'<br>  and even if thats what you think..its because when a man and a woman like each other, they make a baby, the baby turns out however it turns out and it cant help if it is ugly!..THATS why!<br>  however, i think he is amazingly talented, i like him! :]<br>  and raised by walruses..LOLOL i certainly promise you not..|`|jeYi7APraa	'Contrary to popular belief, the scars were caused by a disease called Lupus which Seal suffered from when he was a child. The particular strain from which Seal suffers causes blistering especially around the facial area, which when ruptured cause deep scarring.'|`|flU2gf54aa	Walruses??? Not only are you plastic but an idiot also|`|8BvPAdp2aa	How can you be so cruel?  Narrow minded people are ugly.  Seal is a great performer, an exquisite talent and a beautiful person. When he was younger, he has lupus, which is why he has noticeable scars.  Have you ever heard that what counts is what's on the inside?  His wife obviously loves him and knows for certain he is attractive.|`|6HkDVYcAaa	Beauty is more than skin deep!

hvrw02Egaa	You should definitely not just jump into the current season. My best advice would be to go to abc.com and watch the episode (they have every episode) from where you left off. If you like it, keep watching!|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Hoo boy, lots of things have changed from the "others" to the "other others'' to 5 of the original castaways getting off the island to them trying to get back to the island to those left behind being stuck in a time skip situation to on and on and on.|`|vDGFRACaaa	They actually left the island in the last season finale. So eggs on you.<br>  <br>  So far this season: All the people who didn't get off the island are stuck time-traveling and it's giving them strokes. So Locke leaves to try and convince the people that left to come back. At first they didn't want to, but they each had their own reasons and decided to go back.<br>  <br>  It was kind-of vague what happened at the end of the last few episodes, but I "think" the island and everyone on it is trapped in the 70s. So they'll probably want to get back to present time, or stop something evil from happening. Or both.|`|AA10954273	They have episodes available at abc.com.  Suffice to say that a lot has happened - several people got off the island and then went back.  There's time travel, dead people and all sorts of changes.  If you jump right in you'll be pretty confused.  For example, a second airplane crashed on the island, which is how several of them got back.|`|CSDlp4Igaa	just go to blockbuster and rent what you missed|`|aBzRV8EXaa	so much happen i cant explain, just to to abc.com

BwaQCorzaa	Well, ABC couldn't have done any better. This season's bachelor was well done. Everyone who follows these "reality" television shows want to be entertained. Seriously, who cares whether or not some dip sh$t finds "true love" ?? We want to see things get ugly..admit it. We like to see tears, broken hearts .and misery. what would happen if everyone in the Bachelor series found their true loves and lived happily ever after?? Do you think anyone would keep watching? To be honest, for me, that would be boring. We enjoy the catfights, back-biting and mean looks towards eachother. To me, that was the funniest thing in the world to see him de-flower her of her " engagement virginity " in front of the whole world, only to dump her in front of millions! Thats entertainment! I just hope ABC can follow up this next season and make us laugh..or cry...|`|brKxytiXaa	i dont watch that show any more|`|F93FZyo1aa	i loved it! i really like Jason as the Bachelor, i think others have sucked!  im glad he came to his senses and wanted Molly back!|`|wy9rgMGsaa	i think it was a crock! He ended up being the worst bachelor in bachelor history!!! Worse the Brad, which I didnt think was possible! It was very unclassy what he did, and Melissa handled herself VERY well! Molly on the other hand, looks ohh soo deperate and pathetic to just take him back after that, shouldnt that be a red flag?? Im sure her parents dont approve of this, but I guess these two are right for eachother...Melissa better just be happy she got out of that mess!|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I think he was a jerk for proposing to her when he was really in love w/Molly.  IF he felt that "empty" after he let her go, he should have run after the limo instead of proposing.  No wonder he got divorced, he's not willing to fight for a relationship.|`|qT9kMFhfaa	First of all if some of you haven't already figured out -- IT WAS A SET UP!!!!!  You know how much they got paid?!?!?  A LOT!  This was the most watched episode and season!  They needed to do something crazy for people to keep watching!|`|vu3HHj9Xaa	He's a self absorbed *** hat.

I also like "Scrubs", it takes insignificant events and makes them funny, but with a lot of slapstick. By the way, is "House" supposed to be a comedy?<br>  <br>  NOTE: I don't know what "Yes Minister" is, I take it that it is British, but I liked that list one poster put on from there.

It depicts a teenage girl who writes continuously in her diary about a traumatic event. A boy (who represents Holland) in the class notices her, and suspects that she is being abused. However, he does nothing, and she is left alone. The school scenes are separated by Holland playing an acoustic guitar in an abandoned room with pages of the diary taped onto the walls.|`|3jBUTewUaa	i love that song !   its about a girl dexter holland(lead singer) knew in HS that was physically abused

I also teach karate volunteer.<br>  I have always wanted to work a crisis center , after my stepdad committed suicide; but I haven't been able to yet..maybe one day.<br>  <br>  I am a huge advocate of volunteerism ; it's the right thing to do first and foremost, but I have met some fantastic people through the years and it's kind of like that saying you teach , and you learn twice..well, you help others and you are indeed helping yourself. <br>  <br>  Sorry, this one hits home for me =) Cheers Aussiegirl|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	Since I was taught by my "mother" that giving" is more important than getting!<br>  50+ years|`|7hrOjPwjaa	I dont actually DO charity but i give to the Salvo's and the red Cross when i see them in shopping centres.<br>  Other than that, i donate blood every 3 months. But if they're gonna start charging patients for blood like they're talking about doing, my blood donations might just stop.|`|8VlDuMFOaa	on and off since i was in my teens...its something I have always enjoyed doing when I have the time...<br>  A few selected environmental organizations, Beyond Blue and also community visitors scheme where I would spend time with an elderly lady with next to no visitors.|`|50UbJp14aa	0 days, 0 months, 0 years|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	A little more then 10 years.

faeUufcQaa	I'd meet them in person seeing how I've got mad survival skills... Just in case........ lmao|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	My first reaction?  Shock.  o_o  I would be stunned that someone with interests and oddities similar to (and as rare as) mine could live so close.<br>  <br>  Second one?  I'd be a little creeped out.  I'm not exactly tall, dark and handsome.  And there's no telling *who* said crush might actually be In Real Life.  There's a lot of people online who still get their jollies off on lying to people about basics--age, gender and things.  Not so good.<br>  <br>  I think at first, if we were both good with it, we might share phone numbers.  It's harder to hide things when you're on the phone, talking.<br>  <br>  But yeah, it would be a while before we'd meet I would think.  I'd just want to make sure I don't get rejected or worse, you know?  Or that I haven't ruined anyone's life with this (since some folks go to great lengths to keep their real and internet lives *separate*).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Star for you.  o_o|`|AA11016425	I woulda been traveling 5 miles had said person not pissed me off completely.|`|i2NqmsBeaa	Ehh. Im not sure.

96AQZUGyaa	No, its money they want. Here is my theory I've thought of long ago...<br>  <br>  Hollywood makes a film. A generation or two watch it, enjoy it. Its played a couple of times on TV but slowly it gets forgotten. Soon a generation is born who've no knowledge of this film. So Hollywood will dig out the script (maybe change a few things, add in some references to modern day things), make the movie and play it in theaters.<br>  <br>  Thus Hollywood gets to make a new movie unknown to the new generation of movie-goers without actually having to work much. Ka-ching!|`|56bNLJykaa	I actually forgot about all of those you mentioned because they were all mediocre in the first place.. In more seriousness, they are remaking Seven Samurai, Oldboy, etc. Its all for the money (Hollywood these days), not because they respect the movie or think that they can do a better job. Glad to see someone on here actually bring this issue up, good job.|`|5FYlXexLaa	They've been remaking films for a very long time. This is nothing new at all in Hollywood. It's always been about the all mighty dollar to the studio heads, this hasn't changed and never will.<br>  <br>  You're better off ignoring them if you think they are treading on a favorite of yours. You will always have the original to watch.|`|p4jgR4alaa	Times change. New technologies and special effects are devolped. And then people say "Hey. I think I'd like to make a movie using one of these nifty new technologies." <br>  Not to mention the age old answer...to make money! $$$. <br>  <br>  <3|`|TGWETA8caa	No original ideas, and they will remake Scream and Speed and on that day when we are all just fed up with remakes they will remake Titanic and the Matrix.|`|NQlU8PMIaa	I actually heard that they may be remaking the Neverending Story - which is a classic, and I think should be left untouched!|`|22eb850bf51032b63e817059ebbe1e77aa	They have been remaking movies since the 1930's, when talking movies arrived they started 'remaking' all the old silent pictures. <br>  <br>  It's fun to see what version you like best.  They have remade movies from being a comedy like "The Philadelphia Story" in the 1940's, to a musical "High Society" in the 1960's.  "The Front Page" was a story about 2 reporters (both men), that was remade as "His Girl Friday" with a man and woman (Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell) in the lead roles.   Ben Hur was a silent movie, remade decades later. Even Alfred Hitchcock remade one of his early pictures he made in Britain later on.  1939's Love Affair (Irene Dunne/Charles Boyer) was later remade as "An Affair to Remember" (Cary Grant) and again as Love Affair (Warren Beatty) in 1994.  "The Shop Around the Corner"  (Jimmy Stewart), became a musical "In the Good Old Summertime (Judy Garland) and then back to romance in "You've Got Mail" (Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan).  <br>  <br>  Often their are new stars in new generations that want the opportunity to play a role made famous long ago.  Since in the 1930-1960's there were no VHS/DVD's often there was no conflict as most younger people had no way of seeing the older movies.  That all has changed now.<br>  <br>  The more Hollywood is run by bankers, the less originality is out there and they make movies based on formulas.  So they will keep remaking what worked in the past.<br>  <br>  It would be great if the www.imdb.com had a section on each movie that linked the actual plots to how many times it was used in other movies.
YwtXSUAdaa	Protest the Hero<br>  Meshuggah<br>  Slayer<br>  Gojira<br>  Blind Guardian<br>  Cynic<br>  <br>  ^^^^ Haha, looks like you're not the only one.|`|u8ia6oKxaa	Blind Guardian.<br>  <br>  They are one of my favourite bands and put on one of the better concerts I've been to.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Cxyd3VxbQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Cxyd3Vx...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyNUT7fbECQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyNUT7fbE...</a><br>  <br>  ***i do like all the bands listed though|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Slayer!

I like them best :)|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Slayer :]]<br>  <br>  I really like Cynic and Protest the Hero though.|`|IvAJwpjgaa	honestly i like them all, but of course not everything they did. <br>  <br>  for the ultimate Cynic vs Meshuggah.|`|0E22sQ9Oaa	Meshuggah<br>  <br>  Followed probably by Cynic :)|`|AA10848630	Slayer, in terms of talent and influence.<br>  I got flamed for saying that Slayer is better than Pantera on another question... haha.  Kids these days.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Blind Guardian, followed closely by Gojira here.|`|efbb692cea0ae6c21e32d9d37bbdd49caa	Gojira|`|Mj5dZEm2aa	hey he made it from the bottom to the top...he can be as arrogant as he wants...he made it....his name is widely known so yeah!!!!|`|SmVHRpr5aa	Gojira. They're one of my favorite bands.|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	Slayer!!!

"Angel of Death" is amazing and "Bloodline" is one of the best headbanging songs ever.<br>  <br>  Though Blind Guardian is amazing too.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Burn, I did not thumb you down, but I think you are receiving thumbs down for your statement, "you chose a bad selection"|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Gimme some Slayer!|`|komayN73aa	im gonna be the only one who says this<br>  <br>  protest the hero<br>  <br>  never heard blind guardian<br>  dont care for slayer<br>  dont listen to meshuggah or gojira though i know they are good i just havent had time to look them up<br>  only just started to get into cynic<br>  <br>  so i choose protest the hero|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Slayer. <br>  <br>  None of those bands are my favorites though. You chose a bad selection.<br>  <br>  Geez. Why do I get thumbs down every time I express my opinion? I don't give you guys thumbs down for opinions that oppose mine!|`|7fEVNng5aa	Slayer overall, but Meshuggah is one of the most interesting bands out there, IMO|`|mNC4r3EIaa	Blind Guardian. I started listening to them really recently, they're great.
kP0JGI1waa	hmm....darn its tough, but i will have to go with bad brains, no real clear reasoning.<br>  <br>  colors by between the buried and me<br>  a select few who go to concerts with me<br>  my dad likes the old school music (hendrix, zeppelin, sabbath) that i do<br>  of course! haha|`|3voM7Gfsaa	Damn hard question!<br>  <br>  I think Bad Brains are definitely more of an instant fix band. I could probably listen to them more, where as Fugazi take some exploration. Hmmm. This is hard, I dunno who to go for!<br>  <br>  Im tied with them both, impossible to chose.<br>  <br>  BONUS<br>  <br>  what will be the next CD you will buy?- The new Propagandhi album.<br>  Do you and your friends like the same music? Some do! There's definitely some crossover. A lot of them hate some of the stuff I like though.<br>  you and your parents? My parents have never once complained about the music I listen to and have even been supportive of bands I've been in (although I've never let them come see me play live out of embarrassment, not that they'd be there but that they'd see me being a loud, angry idiot).<br>  any autographs from bands? Autographs are gay. <br>  Do you sing in the shower?Hell yes! But only when I'm home alone (don't want my roomies hearing me!)|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Bad Brains<br>  <br>  what will be the next CD you will buy? -I already pre-orded Metamorphosis (Papa Roach)<br>  <br>  Do you and your friends like the same music? -Yea, it's mainly why we became friends in the first place haha<br>  <br>  you and your parents? -About that...<br>  <br>  any autographs from bands? -A local band called Later Days. And now they are on iTunes! And I'm supposed to get one in the mail from Papa Roach for being one of the first 500 people to pre-order.<br>  <br>  Do you sing in the shower?-Oh yes!|`|wDisAke1aa	I'm gonna go with Bad Brains on this one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Can't say for sure but probably Turf Wars by Daggermouth.<br>  <br>  Yes<br>  <br>  No<br>  <br>  Luiz Beza from Suburban Legends signed my chuck and i have some other random stuff signed.<br>  <br>  I do not sing in the shower.|`|yl3Mns4Maa	Fugazi.<br>  <br>  PJ Harvey's newest...when it's released. That or I'm not sure...maybe X's Los Angeles because I saw that used somewhere, but didn't have money, so I might have to go back and get it.<br>  No.<br>  hmmm, some.<br>  Nope<br>  No, no|`|eEoeURDHaa	Hey, I got suspended :(<br>  <br>  I like Bad Brains the best of the two, but you're right, tough choice<br>  <br>  Megadeth's new album<br>  Some<br>  Sorta<br>  Nope :(<br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Thank you! I'm trying to find all my old contacts.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Woah. This is a hard decision. I'm gonna have to say Fugazi because I know more songs. I only know a handful of Bad Brains songs.<br>  Bonus-<br>  <br>  1. I'm finally going to buy Love, Hate, Then There's You by the Von Bondies tomorrow :]<br>  2. not at all.<br>  3. Somewhat. We're both really into Classic Rock<br>  4. I usually get body parts signed, but those wash off D=<br>  5. Hell yes I do! ;D

rHrZOSc7aa	It might be called headcap. Thats what I saw on the internet. Its normal for them to pop off.. one of my flutes do that and its only about 5 years old. I would go to the shop to get it replaced because even if you found a place on the internet that sells them, it might not fit right when you try to screw it on your flute. The point of it is to help keep your flute in tune better so its good to have one.
srtoPxN2aa	I love The Beatles...and when people shrug them off, and compare them to that of "just another Boy Band", 'N SYNC, Back Street Boys, or Jona's Brother's, I really have to laugh, as it's apparent those people haven't got the slightest clue regarding the evolution of Rock Music.<br>  <br>  I'll try to break it down for those of you who are truly misinformed...<br>  No offense... :)<br>  <br>  Since the 1950's, Rock and Roll has been a progression. During the 60's The Beatles opened the doors, and influenced all aspects of pop culture/rock music for the duration of that decade, which in turn had a profound effect on everything that came after. In saying this, you would not have The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, The Byrds, The Hollies, and the thousands of bands that seemed to explode onto the scene who were in many ways influenced by The Beatles. ie: Many of the hard rock/metal and punk bands of the 70's grew up in the 60's listening to The Beatles, and were either directly, or indirectly influenced by them during their youth. The Beatles music touched everyone, and some of those 70's bands would include Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, The Ramones, Yes, The Sex Pistols, Deep Purple, The Buzzcocks, Led Zeppelin, etc...and those bands in turn influenced just about every genre/sub genre that's evolved since. If we were to remove The Beatles from this progressive equation, you wouldn't have many of the aforementioned bands, as it was The Fab Four who gave many of them the incentive to pick up a guitar, and write their own music in the first place.<br>  <br>  The fact that The Beatles were only a fully functioning band, and a world wide phenomenon for a little over 7 years...and are still being talked about nearly 40 years after their demise says something with regards to their impact on rock and roll, and pop culture in general.<br>  I grew up in the 60's, and the Beatles influenced everything from music, fashion, art, and even the way some kids spoke at the time! Other bands like The Stones always looked up to the Beatles back in the 60's. They tried their darnedest to be as creative, and write their own material. In that aspect, Jagger and Richards only wished they had half of Lennon and McCartney's talent, as they couldn't go on playing blues covers forever. In fact the Stones first hit was written by the Beatles, 'I Wanna be Your Man'.<br>  So many bands in the 60's tried to look like and sound like the The Beatles; Paul Revere and the Raiders, Count Five, The Byrds, Blues Magoos, Hermans Hermits, Manfred Mann, The Kinks, the list is endless. Even the Rolling Stones copied their look in the beginning. EVERYbody did to some extent.<br>  When it comes to the music side of the influence thing, the Stones can hardly be called original, as they primarily ripped off American bluesmen anyway. Even Keith Richards admitted that every lick he plays, he stole from Chuck Berry!<br>  At the start of their career, The Beatles did borrow a lot of things from the likes Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and Little Richard too. But they were more subtle about it, and payed more attention to writing original songs, geared towards the new style of rock or 'Beat Movement' which they themselves had started. What the Stones might have influenced, was the 60's Garage band scene, along with the 60's British blues movement, The Yardbirds, John Mayalls Blues Breakers, Fleetwood Mac, The Pretty Things, Savoy Brown, Chicken Shack, etc. I think the Stones and The Kinks really helped put that movement into gear, and have always been very blues based in their approach, with the exception of some of their more experimental late 60's psychedelic material. Then before long, they realized they weren't quite as imaginative as the Beatles in that regard, and went back to a more blues/rock approach again.<br>  The Beatles on the other hand went after a much larger fan base/demographic, not only the young influential fans of the 60's Rock, Pop and Beat Movement...but many of the 'Mom & Pop' 20-30 something's could also relate.<br>  We can also talk about studio and recording techniques / trickery, ie; Sgt Pepper. The Beatles and George Martin really set the marker high on that one! Even though many of these studio techniques were used previously by people like Les Paul, Phil Spector, Frank Zappa &The Mothers of Invention/Tom Wilson, The Beatles really had the imagination, and writing skills to convey this new medium properly.<br>  Take a look at the Stones 'Their Satanic Majesties Request', those guys were always trying to play 'catch up' to the 'Fab Four'.<br>  <br>  The Beatles dropped their 'She Loves You yeah yeah' style in the summer of 1965 when they released Help (the album, not the soundtrack), along with Rubber Soul the same year. Not one song on either of those LP's resembled the Beatles style of "yeah yeah yeah" from a year or two earlier. The Stones were primarily blues and R&B from day one and only explored new areas and experimental territory because the Beatles did. Even on 'Out of Our Heads', 'December's Children (And Everybody's)' both released in 1965, the Stones had very little to offer as far as something new and fresh, and were still basically regurgitating old R&B riffs, with a couple exceptions.<br>  It wasn't until 1966 with the Stones release of Aftermath with songs like 'Stupid Girl', 'Lady Jane', 'Mothers Little Helper', had the Stones begun to experiment, but the bulk of that album was still R&B. The 1st truly experimental Stones album was 'Between the Buttons' in 1967, where all the songs were experimental, and they tried hard to shed their R&B style. It was released a year an a half after the Beatles had already accomplished shedding their earlier style. Everybody followed the Beatles back in the day.<br>  <br>  The fact that people are still debating this age old 'Beatles vs Stones' thing, or even still discussing The Beatles in an open forum decades after their demise such as this says something about just how influential/brilliant the Beatles really were. Hell, I've even seen people here in Y!A ask silly comparative questions like "which do you think is better...MCR or The Beatles". What's up with that? I'll tell you what...it's called staying power! Do you really think any of the current bands will be held in such high regard in 40 years time?<br>  If the Stones had broken up in 1969/70, I seriously doubt they would have had the same impact on music the way the Beatles have all these years later. It's obvious that The Beatles have had more staying power and influence than any 60's band...and it was the 60's that shaped rock and roll, and made it what it is today. The Beatles back catalog has been a source for inspiration / material by everyone from Jazz musicians to Classical orchestration. Heck even 'Circ Du Soleil' has based an entire show on the Beatles music 37 years after they broke up.<br>  Obviously I am a Beatles Fan. Not only was I there, I was also paying attention. If it wasn't for the Beatles opening the doors and starting the whole British invasion...quite simply, most of what you listen to today would not exist.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that The Beatles were extraordinary musicians that played with any sort of virtuosity...because we all know they weren't. But they did have something nobody else had back in the 60's...and that's called originality!<br>  <br>  FYI...I am also a metal head, jazz head, punk head, prog head, blues head, classical head etc. As I've mentioned, rock music is a progression, with each generation being influenced by its predecessor. Removing The Beatles from history would be like removing a key organic compounds from the building blocks of life; CHNOPS – carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. If we were to eliminate one of these essential ingredients, we would no be here, or life would not be as we know it.<br>  Well...that might be a bit excessive...and it's only meant as a crude analogy...but at least I've gotten my point across.|`|cTYhnumDaa	To the person above: Your musically ignorant if you cant accept that people have different taste in music. (:<br>  <br>  Well to be honest ok, I do like Eleanor Rigby but I have to say when people ask who was the best band ever? It always seems to be The beatles and sure, they came along at the right time when music kinda sucked and they were great compared to all the other bands but seriously they arent the best band ever, what about Pantera, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Slayer, Black Sabbath etc etc..<br>  <br>  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and thats fine, if you like them you like them but I don't see what the big thing is about them.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Because they were the "one" band my parents "let" me listen to.<br>  <br>  No, really. I like some of their stuff ok, some of it sux. I really don't get all the hype.|`|ab94bedc12a9fc428fe15a358421c618aa	I personally like The Beatles but I think the biggest reason is because music has changed so much over the years and its just not in people's tastes anymore.|`|HysVH9qLaa	because all they are were a pop boy band before the jonas brothers. really. and then they just became hippies singing about nonsense.....|`|XBV6DP84aa	Not...like...the Beatles? <br>  I feel sick. <br>  Help!|`|yhqa5FIXaa	I love The Beatles and no matter what any douche says, I will still love them.|`|CJop46QXaa	they are too good?|`|96AQZUGyaa	Reasons why I hate "The Beatles":<br>  <br>  - Their music really isn't that much different from the numerous other bands who played during their time.<br>  <br>  - They are commercialized to hell and back. Marketing was their best friend and I can never love a band who gets glorified to the point when people listen to them to fit in because its what is "in".<br>  <br>  - I see an uncanny parallel between the Beatlemania of then and the hysteria we see in fans of bands we have today like Jonas Brothers. No, you can't say Jonas suck because music is all relative. To a Jonas fan their music is the best thing.<br>  <br>  - They made like 20 albums... hello, marketing? You gonna tell me they actually made quality songs, each thought out and full of meaning? Doubt that.<br>  <br>  - I listen to their music and I can't feel any energy or passion in it, no fire. Its like... something you hear while shopping or in an elevator, sorry. It really makes me feel sleepy.<br>  <br>  - I found John Lennon extra irritating for his ideological beliefs which he brought into his music. Even when my favourite band makes a political song I don't listen to it.<br>  <br>  - The fans: criticism is usually taken very badly. Just like Jonas fans.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I have not answered one of these in a long long time. I got tired of repeating myself over and over and so did everyone else. But its been a while and I know you have enough self confidence as well as competence, common sense to not get all offended, wigged out and butt hurt from my answer. That's what I really like about you syd. <br>  <br>  The Beatles had their own sound, played their instruments correctly and for the mainstream pop/rock area of those times wrote good songs for their fans. I will give them credit for all that.<br>  <br>  However, no matter how you look at it they were Bubble Gum pop/rock that was focused around the glam, fame and the culture of a "Hollywood" nature it was england or whatever I am just giving an example with the term "Hollywood" more Mainstream Glam is where I am getting at. They were a sophisticated Boy Band that wrote better songs than Hanson, The Backstreet Boys, Jonas Brothers ect but they were a boy band with their own sound. They had a mass Fan Girl following that would scream at the top of their lungs and buy all their records and they knew that and so did the record companies. They used that and kept making music for that aspect of things as well. <br>  <br>  Their music is dull, average, and even cheesy like Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. That song sounds like it belongs in Willy Wonka with all the Oompa Loompas dancing around to it or little troll midgets.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	LOL this could be a good way to start a block party.lol<br>   Anyone who hates the Beatles IMO is crazy and musically ignorant.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	I don't dislike the Beatles but neither do I LOVE them...I like them a bit but I prefer Heavy Stuff that can smash my brain. BRING ME SOME PANTERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|daza5A4vaa	How do you hate The Beatles?<br>  Seriously?<br>  They're fantastic.|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	Just not my taste. Simple as that.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Im a fan of The Beatles, however, im not a big fan of their early stuff, I get bored of simple 2-3 minute songs easily, and those first 2-3 records are not really to my taste.  It was only after I started listening to Revolver did I get into them.<br>  <br>  Not everyone is going to like the Beatles, everyone has their own taste, and some people just don't like the vibe from Beatles songs, which are for the  most part life affirming and poppish as some would say.  <br>  <br>  I am a much bigger fan of The Beatles experimental albums, and will say that I would not ever own the first Beatles records.. just according to my taste... Just because they are the Beatles does not mean you have to like every song they made, nor like them at all.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I'm not a HATER as such, I'm just not a fan. <br>  <br>  However, Pattern Juggleeeeer stole my god damn reason!!!!!! Ahh!!<br>  <br>  Umm I guess I better attempt to put it in my own lovely way XD<br>  <br>  I've never heard a song of theirs that made me feel like "F*ck, YEAH!!" Not like Queen, or GNR, or Led Zeppelin for that matter. I suppose they just don't grab me, so to speak!!<br>  <br>  Apart from Hard Days Night 'cause I LOVE that song!!!! ITS BEEN A HARD DAYS NIIIIIIIIIGHT YEAH IT DAMN WELL HAS!!!!!!!!! XD<br>  <br>  Ahem...I'll stop :)<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  "Oompa Loompas dancing around to it or little troll midgets." HAHAHAHA Shred you are so right, hahahaha XD|`|DnWsMhwLaa	I do like the beatles and i have a theory as to why some people dont:<br>  because the really good stuff isn't what gets played much.<br>  apart from a couple songs (revolution #1, day in the life, something, taxman) their best stuff doesnt really get played on the radio. people grow up mainly hearing more poppy stuff like i want to hold your hand, she loves you, 8 days a week, hey jude... and they assume that they are a toothless pop band- and who can blame them, really?|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	Even though I'm in my 40's, their music just never appealed to me, probably because it was over-played on the radio back then ( I tend to dislike over-played music and music that everybody likes). However I do like a handful of their songs that are very rare and hardly got any air play.|`|87CAVhs2aa	GAH! That's blaspheme!<br>  Really, though. For some people, it's just because it's not their music. For others, they're just being stubborn because The Beatles are "Too overrated" and "Too old"<br>  <br>  And to person WAAYY above me: They made about 15 albums, not 20 (not that it makes much a difference). Some of them didn't have much meaning. The real meaning came in their later songs.|`|7fEVNng5aa	I'm not a huge fan of The Beatles, but I'm not a hater, either. Just indifferent, I guess. There are songs that I really like, but most of their songs evoke an "eh" reaction from me. I've never heard an album of theirs that just made my jaw drop. To each his/her own.|`|qh9Pa1tVaa	'cause their just so popular, not a unique band! <br>  actually I just like George Harrison.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	They are way too overrated.<br>  I don't see anything special about their lyrics. Nothing about them stands out to me.
aaUogxkHaa	They didn't show us what was in the prenup.<br>  Just that David told her she didn't have time to read it, if they were going to get married that day.<br>  Krystal is beyond stupid as far as I am concerned and she deserves what she gets.|`|rFZtQuV2aa	I'm sure it just protects David and his assets and children - if he has any. Krystle is an idiot to think life is all about a man in your bed 24/7.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	They don't tell us. It probably entitles David to Grandfather rights with Little A or something...haha I dunno. Crystals an idiot for signing it without reading it though..|`|AA11202477	David said something to the effect that it protects his heirs if he's divorced - but whatever it said, Krystal is so beyond stupid for signing it without reading it. Of course, this is Krystal we're talking about, and we know she's stupid because she believes every lie that falls out of David's mouth. Who'd a thunk I'd ever grow to despise a character that started out so strong and sassy, but who has now become something like a cross between a doormat and a wet dishrag.|`|OSt9X8puaa	krystal has done lost her mind.i don't get why she signed that pre-nup without reading it.i don't get why they are doing this to her character.we all know david is planning to go after lil a.her friends have all warned her of his plans and she is not listening to any of them.she says how much she loves babe and jenny.well babe would not approve of her being with david and she has basically gave up on jenny for david.tad would allow her to be in the babies life if she would not be with david.|`|AA10696567	Krystal was pretty damn stupid for not reading it first.  She has NO clue what she just signed or what she stands to lose.|`|FgVDNguyaa	Krystal is idiot period.|`|pyI0d8Lnaa	It's any oness guess what is in the pre-nup. All we know is with David it  can't be anything good. I expected nothing less from David.|`|l3k21kTmaa	i'm not sure but shes a fool for signing without knowing whats on it..
NGNeT3rYaa	It looks that way but I have noticed lately that ABC has been using old footage in their promos to make people think that certain couples are reuniting , they did the same thing with Jason and Sam on GH a few months back. I hope Kendall and Zach can make it work, I like them together!|`|OSt9X8puaa	i do not want ryan and kendall to get together.i don't think anybody can match the zack/kendall love story.i can't wait til reese leaves town.she caused to many problems|`|rFZtQuV2aa	I agree with HipHop.  Ryan doesn't deserve to be with anyone until he learns it's not always all about HIM.  Kendall and Zach should work to make their marriage last. Both of them. They have children.|`|AA10696567	I saw it, but I surely hope not.  I cannot stand Ryan!!  Then again, I think Reese and Zach would make a pretty hot couple.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	I would like to see Ryan and Kendall ride off into the sunset...or maybe off a cliff.|`|AA11202477	If they put Kendall back with Ryan, I'm through watching. I don't like Ryan's character anymore - he's become entirely to judgmental and blames everyone for his mistakes. Besides, he kicked Kendall to the curb before and basically treated her like cr**.  The Kendall I grew to like wouldn't put up with Ryan for a minute.|`|Zss0O9tjaa	If if Ryan & Kendall get together again, I'm done. I Cameron M but him as Ryan is really starting to drive me crazy. Kendall needs to stay with Zach. Reese needs to leave town. Ryan needs to go on a nice little trip for a while.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	I am so sick of this story line! Sick of Ryan. Sick of Kendell.|`|l3k21kTmaa	ughh Kendall that cheating B^&(% she needs to stop and take care of her babies.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	Im getting kind of sick of Kendall, i understand she woke uo to find out she was lied to and betrayed but still the way she was acting was completely irrational, and if she sleeps with Ryan she is an even bigger hipocrit than i thought.

z3WTXOmZaa	U2, they're not so good, and that Saint image of Bono makes me sick. I really don't like them, sometimes I feel they appreciate their music more for all the public philantropist work (that all artists do but more private) than for their music|`|HysVH9qLaa	The Beatles, Bon Jovi|`|cYPIJql2aa	The Beatles were innovators, who to some untrained ears, mny sound pretty basic now, but in the concept of their time, they were pioneers, so have to be discounted in the overrated bracket.<br>  Led Zeppelin were aslo setting trends, rather than following them, and created a new agenda for others to follow.<br>  So that leaves Bon Jovi and U2, and because of his hypocritical rants about conservation, I vote the tiresome Bono and his group as the most over-rated.|`|J2S0OiDNaa	Forget what all of them are Saying Led Zeppelin was one of the greatest bands they set the standards along with Def Leppard, AC/DC, Guns N Roses,  Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, Boston, Van Halen, ZZ Top, Queen, Styx, sex Pistols, Lynard Skynard, Kiss, and Black Sabbath. All Amazinggg Bands they made rock and bands like U2 and all that dumb **** are ruining it.<br>  <br>  If any of the bands you listed are over rated its U2 <br>  <br>  I mean come on as I see it theres only one stairway to heaven<br>  That was one of the greatest song of all time.<br>  I'm in a band myself no were no huge not a lot of people know us but people around here like us and thats all we care about is our fans **** the popularity and the money we just play for the fans|`|Vo9WWQpnaa	BOn Jovi. Nothing good has EVER come from Jersey....|`|io35ArSWaa	Easily U2<br>  They are overrated and blown out of proportion.<br>  Like the last user said they are "McDonalds" of the world<br>  Bon Jovi is not given that much credit for it to even be compared to the Beatles or Led Zeppelin. Now you may personally dislike Zeppelin and the Beatles but they worked hard to be well know. Where as U2 hasn't done much and its mostly BONO people are going crazy for, not the band itself|`|ZRk15H9Caa	I do not see what is so great about the Beatles|`|IgFXv2Tfaa	U2 try to recall songs? U2?|`|W5adDIAfaa	U2|`|VhT8y0L9aa	Surely U2, i can't stand their music.|`|Cxfi2kOmaa	U2 I'm not sure why, I just really don't like them. They suck.|`|9V4F1wCMaa	I like U2 and Led Zeppelin but not the Beatles or Bon Jovi. I don't think any of them are really overated. Music is an opinion. And most people are just putting down the band they don't like. That is why the answers are so random.|`|EB8MubVZaa	U2<br>  everyones like 'oh Bono, his band are awesome'<br>  but i really dont see the appeal :S<br>  <br>  vertigo bugs the hell outta me<br>  <br>  but tbh, i dont like any of those, except a lil bit of bon jovi maybe|`|CJop46QXaa	It is by far Bon Jovi,     i mean how many songs can anybody really name by them besides, Shot Through the heart, living on a prayer, and wanted|`|IvAJwpjgaa	omg, ALL of them are blown way out of their natural proportions.|`|DsF05nHZaa	U2, I don't put anything they did with the greatest of all-time.

Both earned their respective places. It's when people start calling them things that they are not. When people start calling the Beatles more than "Pop", then they become overrated. When people start calling Led Zep "Metal", then Led Zeppelin becomes overrated. When held to the right positions, these bands are NOT overrated, but rather, very talented and classy in their fields.<br>  <br>  Bon Jovi I think falls to something similar. They were glam/hair metal. <br>  And it's time to face it: For their genre, they were great! When someone calls them one of the best glam bands or best hair bands, then they fit the bill! They are not overrated in that sense. <br>  <br>  When someone starts calling them something otherwise, such as classic rock, that's when they become overrated. They were not classic rock, nor will they be. They will always be the pinnacle of glam/hair/80's rock, but nothing more. Keep them in that cage, and they are NOT overrated.<br>  <br>  U2 however, is a Catch-22. U2 really doesn't fall into a specific realm at all, but people still call them fantastic amazing rock gods, calling The Edge one of the greatest guitarists ever. In the same sense, they aren't pop, yet people call them insanely good singers. I would call them the most overrated in your list because they have no real solid background to call them overtly talented in.|`|PnseHBMvaa	the beatles are not as good as everyone makes out.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	The Beatles. They hold a record for most albums sold by any band. That's reason enough. The music doesn't matter because they get a lot of credit that could be given elsewhere.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	The Beatles.......they had WAY too many fans and were very well known by pretty much everyone, and people still talk about them. But I still like them.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	U2, The Beatles earned their respect even if you don't like them.  Led Zeppelin earned their respect even if you don't like them.  No one gives 2 sh**s about Bon Jovi anymore except Soccer moms.  and well U2 Is like the Mcdonalds of the music world... need I explain?<br>  <br>  People put u2 on a pedestal, No one puts Bon Jovi on top artist lists of all time.|`|eRVRWwkBaa	oooohhhh, a hard one.I really wouldn't agree with Led Zeppelin.<br>  But it's good to know that i'm not alone in thinking the Beatles are a bit overrated. <br>  But I'll go with Bon Jovi because how many great albums and how many classic songs? I've always wondered why they made a bigger deal of them than other bands that were in their era and Why?<br>  AnSWER > Bon Jovi|`|ZnMLkSeQaa	U2|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	U2.<br>  I like them, but VH1 has been playing them all day long and I'm like "okay, what gives?!" x]|`|euZRbiA2aa	For me the Beatles are no better than a boy band watch early footage and the crowd is full of little girls.<br>  Bring on the tds|`|SyoBirYDaa	The Beatles and Zeppelin are not as great as many of their  fans would want you to think<br>  <br>  inb4shitstorm Td's|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	I would say of the four, 'Bon Jovi' but I'm not sure they are even well regarded enough to be overrated.|`|M7E1uIsKaa	The Beatles<br>  <br>  I loathe The Beatles!|`|2T8vRvwMaa	Bon Jovi are famous and sold a lot of records but they aren't really hailed as amazing or critically good so you can't say they are overrated, you can say that they suck though. U2 on the other hand often are in lists of "greatest whatevers" even though they are boring so yes, they are overrated. The Beatles are overrated by a long shot but that's just my opinion. Selling a billion records, contrary to popular belief, doesn't make you the best. Led Zeppelin are and always will be, one of the greatest bands of all time in terms of Influence, Individual Talent, Group Talent, Live Talent and Song Writing. The Beatles did pave the way for other bands and did alot of revolutionary stuff, apparently, but they are still really boring.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Please<br>  <br>  Bon Jovi by lightyears. They are veritably made of suck and fail.|`|jA1ukKSHaa	I really really don't like U2 and I can't give you an answer why haha.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	U2<br>  Bono! 'nuff said!|`|thTNfqbbaa	U2 is Pretty Good Bono is really the only person who makes U2 so great.<br>  <br>  Bon Jovi is Awesome I like about 7 of There songs Jon Bon Jovi is pure Talent<br>  <br>  Now Zeppelin is no Way Overated mainly beause all the members were one of the best at what they did lets see<br>  <br>  John Paul Jones - Definately a Great Bassists<br>  <br>  John 'Bonzo" Bonham - One of The Best Drummers in History maybe behind Keith Moon and Neil Peart<br>  <br>  Jimmy Page - Truelly one of the All Time Greatest Guitarists Maybe Third only to Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix<br>  <br>  Robert Plant - Arguabally the Greatest Frontman of all time probally tied with the late great Freddie Mercury<br>  <br>  and The There's the Beatles who I Despise, I mean Paul McCartney's Wings were okay but The Beatles were so Overrated for there Time I think the Rolling Stones were better than them back in the day.<br>  <br>  So The Beatles are definately the most overrated band of those 4|`|yhqa5FIXaa	I am a huge fan of all these bands but I pick Bon Jovi|`|zijhBbBaaa	the Beatles- Biggest selling artists of all time! so they are goooood!

IPFCtyvQaa	it's a bit unexplainable,<br>  <br>  It's mostly just thinking on the spot. <br>  If you think of something funny (that's little to not offensive), you can say it, just don't think too hard about it.<br>  Try to be funny in sporadic moments, (I think thats what your talking about.)<br>  You have to know how to be funny though, like if you make jokes like "that's what she said"  you have to know when to do them and who to do them around, (IE if your around a girl notorious for sticking up for other girls then you might not want to make a "that's what she said joke"...)<br>  And if you make a bad joke a good rebound is "what... too soon?"<br>  Another thing to keep in mind is DON'T USE THE SAME JOKE TWICE.

vOJlq2kaaa	He most likely uses a flash gun. It's a small "gun" that has a small electric igniter inside. You put in some flash cotton to use as a propellant, crumple up the flash paper and insert it into the gun barrel. When the flash cotton is ignited it burns very quickly creating gasses that push the lit flash paper out of the flash gun. Thus a flying fireball is created.<br>  It's fairly easy to hide a small flash gun in your head and create the illusion that the fireball is simply flying out of your hand.<br>  I got my flash guns, flash cotton, and flash paper at <a href="Http://www.Skylighter.com" rel="nofollow">Http://www.Skylighter.com</a>

FhKfyxWlaa	Well, I have always been good at saving my money, so fortunately the recession hasn't really had  an effect on me.  Our taxes will soon be going up under this new administration, but hey, taxes are a necessary evil we all have to live with.  I am a Cancer, and I think this makes me well prepared. You know us crabs...always looking ahead and preparing for whatever tragedy we can imagine. We always want to be secure so we save, save, save for a rainy day. My husband is a Capricorn, so you can imagine how well we have our finances in order. :)
AA11899483	i dont deal with loss too well, i have lost those i love and the losses have helped shape me into the person i am. its wierd but all those people i have lost, who i was very attached to, i feel them around me and feel they are the ones helping me survive this world. the lessons they learnt i feel as if they are teaching me, spiritually. <br>  <br>  i never complately let go, i can control my emotions and have learnt to deal with the grief, but the memories and the emotions that went with it, will never fade and they are with me everyday. i think my losses made me go through emotional reincarnation. through the losses i have stooped to my all time lowest but when i eventually saw another side on how to deal with it, i grew from that and that helped me learn to control my life, and that takes me to a higher point in my life. i see that if my emotions can ruin me, then it could do the opposite and do good for me aswell.<br>  <br>  i take my relationships and those i love to full force they always have a big effect on my life. their spirit around me is how i deal with it, knowing that i can feel them, even though its not physically their presence in my life is still strong. and if i didnt feel that, then i would just be mourning all the time and that wouldnt do any good for me. just because i cant see them, doesnt mean i dont still have that intense spiritual connection.<br>  <br>  im a scorpio sun and venus, and both are conjunct pluto. pluto conjunct ascendant in scorpio and in 1st house and my moon is taurus. pluto has taken over my life! lol but pluto has made me see my life in another light. good or bad.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Cancer Sun, Scorpio Moon, Venus and Mercury in Cancer.  So, as you can imagine, I'm sensitive and don't deal easily with loss. Since these placements make it difficult to let go, I think I simply learn to live with the pain. In 97 I lost two people who meant the world to me...one passed from this world, and another is still here but its complicated.  The pain is always with me....some days it doesn't effect me at all, other days its there in the corner of my mind, and then there are some days when I don't want to get out of bed because it creeps up on me so strong.   I'm not sure if this is they type of answer you were looking for, but that's the way that it is for me personally.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Wouldn't that depend on the house which represents the loved one you have lost? (ie. 7th - spouse/partner, 5th - children, 4th - mother, 3rd - sibling, etc.)   For example, when my father died (10th house Aries with ruling Mars in Scorpio in the 4th) I grieved, literally, for years.  When my grandmother (mother's mother) died (7th house Aquarius with ruling Uranus in the 1st), I almost shrugged it off with an intellectual acceptance of death.

You can try reporting this person to see what happens. I think regardless of whether you allow emails or not, you can still report a person. Otherwise, you should ignore this person's emails. Maybe you could try blocking him.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  I'm sure he just wants a little playful chat. But if thats not you then e-mail him let him know to bug off.  I'm sure he'll leave you alone. If not then report him.

Then she will mention how his Father mistreated him when he was growing up - locking him in a closet.

VUfT35UQaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  First off, Miley was not bullied, she said herself that she was a cheer leader in her 3d movie in a behind the scenes part, her mom says 'remember back to cheerleading' and she mentions it in interviews. She just wants sympathy.<br>  <br>  She tried so hard in the excerpt to make it sound dramatic, but it sounds like something I would have written when I was 10... It isn't as much of a literary mater-piece as she thinks.<br>  <br>  I couldn't see the Taylor one because I live in the UK so I'll watch it on youtube!|`|yuHV59Yhaa	I know!

U21TLaqMaa	Think like John Bonham (would): put all your energy into the beat.  Drums sit in the back, so I think that entitles them to play louder than everyone else.  Up the bass and the snares.  If they consider cymbals to be their signature, they can still use it a lot.  <br>     Ask them to pick up any kind of DVD or book, etc. by a good rock band (for instance, I've seen a Led Zeppelin drum book).  It might inspire them.|`|1C4UJLw2aa	I have private drum lessons and my teacher told me to go out and buy "Today's Sounds For Drumset, Volume 1".  It can be found in any music store. Start with lesson 1.  On lesson 1, #8 is very good in almost all songs.|`|HA3CUl0Jaa	The basic rock beat is what it is for most popular music, that is:<br>  <br>  Hi-hat every eighth note in a 4/4 time signature.<br>  Bass every 1st and 3rd beat and Snare every 2nd and 4th beat.<br>  <br>  Create variations on this technique, particularly with added bass. Most of AC/DC's songs use this beat, in fact the majority of classic rock did until Keith Moon's pioneering the Drums as a lead instrument. Find some songs that sound simple and try to play along.<br>  <br>  Another simple yet fundamentally necessary difference is that Jazz typically uses the ride cymbal as the overlying cymbal, while Rock uses the high-hat, with variations on opened and closed patterns.|`|lYL3Jevkaa	I would suggest some good bass pedal. If you add some high hat, it makes the sound flow =D<br>  <br>  For the high hat, hit it while letting go of the high hat pedal, keep it up while doing a fast roll and it will sound sweet. I don't know how well I explained it but oh well...<br>  <br>  Fast rolls help increase the intenseness of the song... I love intense songs =D|`|k9IkrUCVaa	Definitely add more snare hits! it sound silly but it helps. and tell him to really practice with his feet. If he can pull off heel-toe it really helps with bass. also hit the hats harder and keep them slightly open! it takes out some of that jazz sound. good symbols also help. i can't put my finger on it but the change something but i think speed is most important. get a really fast tempo in your head. do slightly open high hat quarter notes and do bass on 1 and 3 and snare on 2 and 4. it works!|`|K9JJLVgFaa	My brother is a drummer, he started off playing AC/DC and stuff liekt hat because they're simple and its rock too. Just look for rock songs with simple drumming for him to practice. Even the white stripes, but they're really simple, I'd probably say start off with AC/DC first,

In the "Eragon" movie, they took out: Katrina, the bald twins, Solembum, which took out the key things that the werecat told to Eragon and are needed in the next books, and they also took out Eragon's blessing of the babe in the dwarf city!! that's MAJOR stuff right there, and there might even be more that was taken out. so, yeah i don't see how an  "Eldest" movie could get anywhere.  i heard a rumor, though, that they would do the "eragon" movie again, BUT it would be from a different character's point of view. like, they were saying they'd make a movie all about Murtagh. now of course i LOVE murtagh, i mean, he's HOT, but how could they make a movie all about him? i have no idea, and that's just a rumor...<br>  <br>  did i even answer your question? well in answer to it, i have not heard that they are making an eldest movie. there are SO many different rumors about it. what i was talking about up there ^^ was my opinion. but as far as the movie making goes, i'm pretty sure they're not currently doing it, they're still talking about it.|`|AA11521270	i dont think there will be on though i would love it if they did..midnight show for sure! but the 1st didn't do so well..|`|4ncmDzdjaa	I havnt heard any thing.  So right now I dont think there going to make one.  Also the messed up the first one (they changed the movie a ton from the book)  so that im not sure they can make a second with out compleatly ruining it.  But still, i hope they do make it,.

Klb4ZYcVaa	Well, if you take a look at the real Harvey Milk, he does look alittle bit like Penn.<br>  <br>  Penn is a remarkable actor, i loved what he said in his speech when he accepted the SAG award for Best Actor--"I didn't play a gay man, I played a human being earning his rights for who he is". <br>  That's what I love about him. He takes risks. He envisions everything in acting. He's worth calling someone an actor. Most guys like Will Smilth turns down movie roles just b/c their character has to kiss a guy. Sean Penn truly sees it as love, no matter what gender. He sees it as acting. When cameras are rolling, he's Harvey Milk, not Sean. So, he plays as Milk. It's incredible. Well deserved Oscar.<br>  & the story is just beautiful.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Sean Penn looks for roles that he feels are challenging and that will cause him to stretch himself as an actor. I don't know if there was a personal reason for taking the role of Harvey Milk, but I do think he believes in the cause of gay rights.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to ask if he's a closet homosexual, I think the answer is no.|`|xqrwDmyUaa	Sean Penn would have known it was a good script and Gus Van Sant the director is very well known. Sean also believes in the cause, no actor is going take to take a role supporting gay rights if they themselves don't.|`|56bNLJykaa	Its not because he is homosexual, if that is what you are looking for. But he certainly is a flexible actor and does believe in pro-gay rights, as do I. good luck|`|hQ95u9OLaa	If you're implying is Sean Penn gay I don't think that's the case. He's married to Robin Wright Penn. I know he could still be gay but I just don't think he is. I think Harvey Milk was an extraordinary opportunity to play an interesting character and he at jumped it. Guess what? He won the Oscar.|`|QC7vlfPPaa	He looks a lot like him actually. I don't know if he is gay, he's kind of ugly though.|`|7fpPupNraa	he accepted the role because he has a charismatic personality and he was willing.|`|oY4vwdjVaa	Sean Penn eats and breathes liberal 'agendas' Of course he would take this role.

0TuWYaneaa	John Wayne is one of the greatest American actors of all time.Not a singer.He is most remembered for his western movies but made several types in his career.He had a statue placed in Hollywood California for being an American hero by our congress after he died. He also had his final movie played on CBS the night of his death.He went out in style.If not for his health he may have been president before he died.|`|V1lKLJ0Daa	Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison in Winterset, Iowa.[2] His middle name was soon changed from Robert to Michael when his parents decided to name their next son Robert. His family was Presbyterian. His father, Clyde Leonard Morrison (1884–1937), was of Irish, Scots-Irish and English descent, and the son of American Civil War veteran Marion Mitchell Morrison (20 January 1845–05 December 1915). His mother, the former Mary Alberta Brown (1885–1970), was from Lancaster County, Nebraska.<br>  <br>  Wayne's family moved to Palmdale, California, and then to Glendale, California, in 1911, where his father worked as a pharmacist in a drug store. A local fireman at the firehouse on his route to school in Glendale started calling him "Little Duke", because he never went anywhere without his huge Airedale Terrier dog, Duke.[3][4] He preferred "Duke" to "Marion," and the name stuck for the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  As a teen, Wayne worked in an ice cream shop for a man who shod horses for Hollywood studios. He was also active as a member of the Order of DeMolay, a youth organization associated with the Freemasons. He attended Wilson Middle School in Glendale. He played football for the 1924 champion Glendale High School team. Wayne applied to the U.S. Naval Academy, but was not accepted. He instead attended the University of Southern California (USC), majoring in pre-law. He was a member of the Trojan Knights and joined the Sigma Chi fraternity.[5] Wayne also played on the USC football team under legendary coach Howard Jones. An injury curtailed his athletic career; Wayne later noted he was too terrified of Jones' reaction to reveal the actual cause of his injury, which was bodysurfing at the “Wedge” at the tip of the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach. He lost his athletic scholarship and, without funds, had to leave the university.[6]<br>  <br>  Wayne began working at the local film studios. Western star Tom Mix had gotten him a summer job in the prop department in exchange for football tickets. Wayne soon moved on to bit parts, establishing a long friendship with the director who provided most of those parts, John Ford. Early in this period, Wayne appeared with his USC teammates playing on-screen football in The Dropkick, Brown of Harvard, and Salute, and was one of the featured football players in Columbia Pictures' Maker of Men (filmed in 1930 and released in 1931).[7]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Film career<br>  After two years working as a prop man at the Fox Film Corporation for $75 a week, his first starring role was in the 1930 movie The Big Trail. The first Western epic motion picture using sound established Wayne's credentials, although it was a commercial failure. Before this film, Wayne had only been given on-screen credit once (in Words and Music), as "Duke Morrison". The director Raoul Walsh, who "discovered" Wayne, suggested giving him the stage name "Anthony Wayne," after Revolutionary War general "Mad Anthony" Wayne. Fox Studios chief Winfield Sheehan rejected "Anthony Wayne" as sounding "too Italian." Walsh then suggested "John Wayne." Sheehan agreed, and the name was set. Wayne himself was not even present for the discussion.[8] His pay was raised to $105 a week.<br>  <br>  Wayne continued making Westerns, most notably at Monogram Pictures, and serials for Mascot Pictures Corporation, including The Three Musketeers (1933), a French Foreign Legion tale with no resemblance to the novel which inspired its title. Coincidentally, he also appeared in some of the Three Mesquiteers westerns whose title was a play on the Alexandre Dumas, père classic. He was tutored by stuntmen in riding and other Western skills.[7] He and famed stuntman Yakima Canutt developed and perfected stunts still used today.[9]<br>  <br>  Beginning in 1928, and extending over the next 35 years, Wayne appeared in more than twenty of John Ford's films, including Stagecoach (1939), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), The Searchers (1956), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). His performance in Stagecoach made him a star.<br>  <br>  His first color film was Shepherd of the Hills (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend Harry Carey. The following year he appeared in his only film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the Technicolor epic Reap the Wild Wind, in which he co-starred with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values.<br>  <br>  In 1949, director Robert Rossen offered the starring role of All the King's Men to Wayne. Wayne refused, believing the script to be un-American in many ways.[10] Broderick Crawford, who eventually got the role, won the 1949 Oscar for best male actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for Sands of Iwo Jima.<br>  <br>  He lost the leading role in The Gunfighter to Gregory Peck because of his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because Columbia chief Harry Cohn had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player.<br>  sorry i cant fit anymore!

EONfJfZfaa	No he was not born with claws.The Canadian Government's Department K, which turns willing and unwilling beings into living weapons turned him into Weapon X. Which bonded his bones with adamantium which gave him claws.|`|uctxzjIIaa	He was born with bone claws, but never knew he had them until they shot out during the adamantium bonding process.|`|F60JZOU3aa	commonly known as Logan, Wolverine is a mutant, possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, retracting bone claws, and a healing factor that allows him to quickly recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin, enabling him to live beyond a normal human lifespan. This healing ability enabled the supersoldier program Weapon X to bond the near indestructible metal alloy adamantium to his skeleton and claws. Wolverine was typical of the many tough anti-authority anti-heroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War;[4] his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book anti-heroes by the end of the 1980s.[5] As a result, the character became the clear favorite for fans of the increasingly popular X-Men franchise.[6] Wolverine has been featured in his own solo comic since 1988 and has been a central character in every X-Men adaptation, including animated television series, video games, and the live-action 20th Century Fox X-Men film series, in which he is played by Hugh Jackman<br>  <br>  <br>  so he was born with claws|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	Read:  Origin: The True Story of Wolverine.  That series follows Wolverine as a child as he grows up.  He grew up with the claws a long, long, long time ago.  Wolverine was running through fields as a boy long before governments in Canada and the USA were fully formed.  Remember what was said in the first movie?  Jean says with Wolverine's healing factor he ages very slowly and my be older than Professor X.  He was actually around in the times of horses and buggies.  And, he had claws.  He's not immortal but will likely live for centuries more if someone doesn't kill him.<br>  <br>  Also, When Magneto ripped the metal from Wolverine's bones the claws were still there.  All the experiment did was bond adamantium to his existing bones.  The only reason he survived the process was due to his healing factor.<br>  <br>  Addendum:  I don't mind getting negative marks.  But, uh guys read the comic I mentioned and also look here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(comics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(...</a><br>  <br>  In the comic...the ORIGIN of Wolverine it shows him as a boy with claws at least 100 years ago.  And, in Wikipedia it states the same thing.  The movies never said anything about him before the experiments.  The comic does.  Read something and don't just spend two hours watching a movie.  Heck, if you watch XMen 3 you would think Wolverine would actually stand a chance against Dark Phoenix.  In the comics Phoenix devoured stars, fought Galactus to a stand still, recreated a person from memory.  In other words, movies are not always true to the books.  He had the claws as a boy.|`|LIawiL9Gaa	As far as I can remember, no he wasn't. It's possible that the movie edits some things from the actual story line, as many movies do this. You can't always believe everything from the movie adaptations.|`|mqxEw2daaa	no, I thought they were placed by Striker as an experiment|`|8Iz5iexIaa	placed by the government|`|CiOD9M11aa	If we are to base it solely on the established facts of the X-men trilogy, and are concerned about the coherence and continuity of the films, then me thinks, young wolvie's claws should've never stick out at an early age. <br>  <br>  As in the X2 plot, Stryker "claimed" that he gave Logan his claws<br>  In X2, while William Stryker was chain-bound unto the helicopter, he yells out to Wolverine: "You were an animal then, you are still an animal now...I JUST GAVE YOU CLAWS!" <br>  <br>  (or something like that..)<br>  <br>  Therefore, this proves that his claws should have been acquired from the Weapon X experiment, where William Stryker was claimed to be (as per Professor X's explanation), the only man who can control the precious metal, adamantium.|`|0llcES4Zaa	Wolverine vol 2, issue 75.  After Magneto ripped out Wolverines adamantium skeleton it was revealed that Wolverine had claws made of bone, meaning he was born with them.  He even says at the end of the comic that he must have been born with them, but he can't remember having them.

Deidara (デイダラ) was a member of the Akatsuki and was first partnered with Sasori before his death, then Tobi. He was the youngest member of Akatsuki. Deidara was originally from Iwagakure, although he readily abandoned the village for the opportunity of using his "art" more frequently as his village ridiculed him for it. Deidara became an assassin bomber for hire, not caring who he worked with so long as he could use his artwork. Sometime after Orochimaru left the Akatsuki, Deidara was located by Itachi Uchiha, Kisame Hoshigaki, and Sasori, who were under the orders of the leader Pain to recruit him. Deidara refused at first, but was forced to join after being defeated by Itachi's Sharingan. Deidara, having taken a huge blow to his ego, carried a loathing for Itachi and other Uchiha for the rest of his life, though he was intelligent enough to recognize Itachi as a more powerful opponent.<br>  <br>  Quotes:<br>  [Catchphrase] "Art is a blast!"<br>  "Fine art is the beauty of that single fleeting moment of explosion." <br>  [Last words, to Sasuke] "Now show me your fear! Drown yourself in the awe... and despair! Cry like a lost child! Because my art... is a BLAST!"<br>  [To Sasuke] "Those eyes!! Those goddarned cocky eyes of yours! It drives me insane!"<br>  "Life's only beautiful… because it's so fleeting, so transient."<br>  [After discovering Sasori's death] "Like anything is left for the future as a thing of eternal beauty...

ysUqQ9Qkaa	Black Jack.  Black Jack because it's got the second highest return on investment (second only to one arm bandits) natively.  However, Black Jack also allows for srategic play.  Meaning that if you count cards in black jack and you are playing at the right table (low number of decks in show, standard BJ rules for dealer, allowed to double on any card and split any pairs) you will actually have a rate of return that exceeds 1.  This means that if you play the right game of black jack at the casino and can count the cards and play correct basic strategy you have a better shot of winning money than losing it.  If you have enough of a bankroll you can actually play strategies that have you doubling up at a greater rate than your risk of total failure.  It's math nerdy, and not exciting like roulette is, and it's not as popular as poker, but for my money . . . or more accurately the house's, there is no game I'd rather play in a casino than Black Jack.<br>  <br>  Incidentally if you had an endless supply of money baccarat would also be nice, cause if you lost you could just go double or nothing until eventually you won and you'd get all your money back plus that amount.|`|84c7ab6723b2a74fb5a71417c33be575aa	I love to play Cleopatra Keno.

lpyWVR2oaa	Since the Sun is the apex planet here, the person tends to have issues revolving around self-identity, self-worth issues more than anything else. Being in hard aspect to Mars and Pluto makes the individual appear to have temper/anger issues but ultimately, this can be traced back to a frustrating lack of self-identity problems. <br>  <br>  You didnt mention about the signs they are found in but Apex Sun in 11th House tends to project this inner frustration onto the social circle and aquaintances, friends around him. As such, you tend to be a target for such projections, not because he is being mean but he may be subconsciously doing so without him being aware of it at all. <br>  <br>  Sun squares Pluto makes the native feel disconnected generally with life on the whole and periods of withdrawal and alienation, self-containment are not uncommon with this aspect. Similarly, Sun square Mars builds up much inner stress, tension and frustration as the native's assertive drives and physical energies seem to be thwarted time and time again by outside forces. In reality, he is equally guilty of much self-sabotaging in this case.<br>  <br>  The key to resolving this T-square aspect actually lies in the planet receiving both squares i.e. the Sun. Although it is the key to the problems, it also holds the potential for transformation. Unless he learns to develop the lessons of self-worth and self-love, he is bound to feel out of sync with others around him and also at constant battle and odds with himself.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Not necessarily. After all, when you look at each placement separately, they aren't that bad. So a difficult placement in a T square with an easy aspect will be a mitigated influence. Sun in the 11th is a very nice placement, allowing the person to have the ability to influence groups and make friends. Mars in the 9th sometimes indicates bad luck in travel, or the need to travel a lot, or in a woman, interest in foreign men. Pluto in 7th could indicate sexual issues of dominance and submission, or it could just represent an intensive in having a sexual partner....

But it was an old dog and died whilst it was staying with her. She phoned up her friend to ask what she should do with the body and her friend said take it to a vet to dispose of it. She lives in london and so the easiest way to get there was on a train. She decided to put the dead dog in a suitcase and went to the station. There, on an escalator, a man saw she was struggling with her suitcase and offered to help her. She gave him the suitcase gratefully. He felt its weight and asked what was in it and she panicked and said there was electronic equipment in there. The man accepted this answer and in literally a second he ran off with the suitcase, believing what she had said.<br>  <br>  Imagine his face when he opened the suitcase.

A7ovwP94aa	Not an international joke but funny anyway.<br>  <br>  Little Johnny and his father came across his puppy, dead in the back yard. Daddy explained that Buddy had gone to heaven.<br>  <br>  "So why are his legs sticking up in the air like that, Daddy?" asked Little Johnny, as he fought back tears. At a loss for something to say the father replied, "Buddy's legs are pointing straight up in the air so that it will be easier for Jesus to take him by the leg and lift him up to heaven."<br>  <br>  Little Johnny seemed to take Buddy's death quite well. However, two days later when his father came home from work, Little Johnny had tears in his eyes as he said, "Mommy almost died this morning." fearing something terrible had happened, his father questioned,<br>  <br>  "What do you mean Johnny? Tell Daddy!"<br>  "Well", mumbled Little Johnny, "Soon after you left for work this morning I saw Mommy lying on the floor with her legs in the air and she was shouting, 'Oh Jesus! I'm coming, I'm coming!' And, if it hadn't been for the neighbor who was holding her down, she would have gone to Heaven just like Buddy did."|`|sB1e8bIGaa	there was a russian, a mexican, and an american from texas stranded on a deserted island. each had a bottle of their favorite booze and a gun with one bullet. the russian downs his bottle of vodka, throws it in the air, shoots it, and says, "in russia we have much vodka."  the mexican downs his bottle of tequila, throws it in the air, shoots it, and says, "in mexico we have mucho tequila". the texan downs his bottle of whiskey, throws it in the air, shoots the mexican, and says, "in texas we have many mexicans".|`|nTJ44u1Maa	JFJ<br>  <br>  There was a brit, pakistani, dutch and german in a train.<br>  <br>  The dutch threw some cheese out the window.

PeuFnqQwaa	They both look pretty cool. I have an old 80's BC Rich eagle and was not impressed with the neck or pickups. I have seen the warlocks, Have not played one, but it looks like it is fairly decent. The DD razorback is made by Dean, they make decent stuff.I am sure the quality is pretty close between the two. I'd try and go to a music store and play both if I were you, then you could decide which played better. I will tell you one thing though... Check out some of the Schecter guitars..They are absolutely amazing. They sound great, are very well made... and they are all set up in Schecters facility in Burbak California. You will not find a better guitar for the money. I just bought one and was blown away with the sound, playability and quality. I am definately going to buy another one.. You should check them out.. I don't think you'll be disappointed. They are very versatile tone wise.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I have a BC Rich warlock hanging on the wall in my bedroom and No razorback but a dean ml & a shadow<br>  <br>  I heard with the razorback that with the edges it makes it harder to play but well worth it<br>  <br>  The warlock sounds good and is worth the price

667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I think Jason is immature, selfish and a jerk.  He knew how he got hurt by Deanna, yet still proposed to Melissa when he obviously had stronger feelings for Molly.  I don't care if he was under contract, if he really loved Molly more, he should have chased her down in the limo.  That would have been romantic and sweet.  He should have told Melissa he wanted to take things slow and see how they would end instead of proposing.  Poor Ty, who knows which lady he liked best, I wonder if he even considered his son's feelings?|`|vu3HHj9Xaa	Jason has no idea what he wants.<br>  <br>  When the going gets tough with Molly, he will start mourning for Melissa...hell, probably even his ex-wife or Deanna.<br>  <br>  I feel sorry for his son having to witness this mess...|`|HmCAPy41aa	Jason makes me sick!

bIhasPyHaa	Toy story.Best Disney film. Ever.<br>  <br>  Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.<br>  <br>  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices.<br>  <br>  And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs – note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.<br>  <br>  Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.|`|U9aGNLojaa	Toy Story.<br>  Every body can relate to wondering if their toys come alive as soon as they closed their door.<br>  Its adorable.<br>  Even adults love it.|`|818c12452a8019abf87834a9c5340867aa	Toy Story, I didn't like Mosters as much as everyone|`|d55D0Ci4aa	They are both very good but if I have to pick, I would go with Toy Story.|`|1fjhg6j4aa	Monsters, Inc.|`|fQkihSHZaa	toy story with out a doubt "TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!"|`|f32Drtu0aa	toy story its a classic|`|5nAnWp3daa	tied|`|JXzqhYDSaa	Monsters Inc.|`|4Dkw2cYEaa	They are both real good..<br>  My daughter prefers Toys Story..so do I|`|D1c8cRM4aa	Toy Story!!!

My two favorite artists! lol<br>  Toby Keith was my first favorite. He has good songs, writes or cowrites the majority of his work which is very respectable, and isn't afraid to speak his mind or support the causes that are controversial. He doesn't let anyone push him around. When his first two record labels tried to make him do what they wanted, he switched, and eventually made his own record label. Plus, he has awesome vibrato and plays on most of his songs!<br>  However, Tim McGraw is my favorite now because his songs just sound better to me. Also, he has used his original band, the Dancehall Doctors, for at least one of his CD's instead of using the studio band. I like most of his songs (of the 508 on my mp3 player, 42 have Tim McGraw in them!) and he just has a very awesome, beautiful voice that can honestly put me in tears. He and Faith do the cutest duets together!<br>  They both have their advantages, but Tim is my favorite with Toby a close second.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  *smile4me* :)|`|GLT99pXhaa	Tim McGraw vs. Toby Keith is an easy one. While McGraw is very good to listen to, he doesn't write any of his own music. That bothers me a lot with musicians. <br>  <br>  Same with Garth Brooks and George Straight. All their songs are written for them by various musicians. To me that takes away from them being entertaining. Maybe it's ridiculous but that's how I feel.<br>  <br>  Toby Keith writes or co-writes a great deal of the music you hear him singing. I think that makes him more enjoyable to listen to.<br>  <br>  Other musicians I enjoy who write or co-write their own music:<br>  <br>  Hank of course<br>  Alan Jackson<br>  Ray Scott<br>  Brooks and Dunn<br>  Josh Turner (a lot of his songs are co-written by him)<br>  Darryl Worley<br>  Jimmy Buffett (he's country sometimes and awesome all of the time)|`|gRkpFHNzaa	Best country singers:<br>  George Strait<br>  Johnny Cash<br>  Hank Williams<br>  Porter Wagoner<br>  Tanya Tucker<br>  George Jones<br>  Merle Haggard<br>  Waylon Jennings<br>  Best Groups:<br>  Statler brothers<br>  Oak Ridge Boys<br>  Gatlin Brothers<br>  Dixie Chicks|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Hank 1, Hank 2 and even Hank 3.|`|6zABol7Oaa	Hannah Montanah|`|fDGlC403aa	good old Hank Snow? sure.<br>  But Glenn Campbell was really great.<br>  Today it's George Strait and Reba.|`|koAaPXKQaa	I love Dixie Chicks and Alison Krauss|`|oauYuhvDaa	Conway Twitty has always been my favorite.

wAtXrMCBaa	Simply ar rahman is great i lov always music from the movie|`|bIhasPyHaa	Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.<br>  <br>  The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.<br>  <br>  At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.<br>  <br>  Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year.|`|l1Dl30g9aa	AMAZING!<br>  best movie i have seen in a long time! it shows what life is really like for some people, cleverly put together to show how to answer the who wants to be a millionaire questions. definatley worth going to see.<br>  if you want, you could watch it online:<br>  www.surfthechannel.com then type in slumdog millionaire<br>  i would rate it 10 out of 10!|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	really good.|`|148e9fae6420dc399a79aca18170d426aa	If your questioning seeing it, then my advice would be DONT.  Go watch it, its great.|`|ee7b4508c5f4d59cc119fd0c3e945b93aa	Like a lot of people, I had absolutely no idea what the movie was about. In fact, my friend and I almost did not see it because a friend of hers had gone to see it the night before and left after 10 minutes claiming it was too violent.  We decided to give it a shot and found the beginning slightly violent (about a "3" on a scale of one to ten).  Well, we are so glad we stayed to watch it -- it was TERRIFIC !!  I won't tell you what it is about or else I'll spoil it for you.  It is so great that it's the kind of movie you want to call everyone you know as soon as you leave the movie theater and urge them to see it ASAP!! Since my friend and I saw it, I still didn't want my husband to miss it (too good a movie to wait for it to come out on DVD) -- so on the following Saturday I watched it a second time with him -- and enjoyed it just as much, if not more.  Everyone we've recommended to see the movie has -- and loved it, too.<br>  <br>  So, in answer to your question:  RUN, don't walk to go see "Slumdog Millionaire" -- a "20" on a scale of one to ten !!|`|AA11187638	It was a good movie.<br>  <br>  It did not, however, deserve to win eight Oscars.

Say it's pay back for all of the nice things she did for you over the years. Or make a coupon book with coupons for small things she likes, things you can do for her, or things you could do together. Make her a meal of her favorite dishes. Bake her a cake or make her breakfast in bed! Maybe host a pot luck surprise party and everyone could share a story or a memory. Maybe you could, if it's possible, take her to a significant place for her, especially emotionally (where she met your dad, where she grew up or had her first kiss) and have her tell you all about it. Say that you want a chance to get to know her, or that part of her life, better.

8tRYrQzpaa	12-Bar Blues is a standard pattern not only for the Blues, but for Rock and Roll as well. Many of the classics were written in 12-bar blues by artists such as the Beatles, Chuck Berry, and Eric Clapton. Think of each bar as a four count. That's one and two and three and four and. Repeat for the next bar.<br>  Typically, three chords are used in the 1-4-5 pattern such as E-A-B, C-F-G, and G-C-D. Once you pick the key, for example Key of C (a good one on the piano), you know all the chords for the song. Next is the pattern. Typically the 12 bars go as follows:<br>  C chord for 4 bars,<br>  F chord for 2 bars,<br>  C chord for 2 bars,<br>  G chord for 1 bar,<br>  F chord for 1 bar,<br>  C chord for 1 bar,<br>  G chord for 1 bar.<br>  That's 12-Bar Blues.<br>  <br>  And you can be a little creative by adding 7ths<br>  C chord for 3 bars, C C7 chord for 1 bar,<br>  F chord for 1 bar, F7 chord for 1 bar,<br>  C chord for 1 bar, C7 chord for 1 bar,<br>  G7 chord for 1 bar,<br>  F7 chord for 1 bar,<br>  C chord for 1 bar,<br>  G7 chord for 1 bar.<br>  <br>  Listen to the music. Remember the pattern. Get the beat. Invite some friends to jam along.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Go here   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_bar_blues" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_bar_...</a>|`|X0525dxGaa	The 12-bar blues is one of the most popular chord progressions in popular music, including the blues. The blues progression has a distinctive form in lyrics and phrase and chord structure and duration. It is, at its most basic, based on the I-IV-V chords of a key.<br>  <br>  The blues can be played in any key, but most guitar and bass players prefer open chords[citation needed], that is, chords with several open strings: E-A-B7 or A-D-E7. Keyboardists may prefer chords with fewer accidentals such as C-F-G7 or G-C-D7.|`|e66ca419b49ca95b3aa5f9c9fae224e3aa	1-1-1-1-4-4-1-1-5-4-1-5 that`s 12 bar blues chords<br>  1 to 5  and 4 to 1 octave above  1 , dom. same interval...

rHrZOSc7aa	Well it really depends on what flute it is. Is it a Yamaha or Gemeinhardt? Or is it an offbrand? It makes a difference on how much you can sell it for. I would check out Ebay to see around what price her brand/model of flute is selling for. <br>  <br>  I would say sell it for about 3/4  or 3/5 of the original price you bought it for because its used and because of the dent.|`|hAzbW082aa	I would say about 600 us dollars i just bough a brand new flute charged me about 950 us dollars so some where for 450 us dollars to 600 us dollars!

rv2FJlIiaa	You love Ouran High School host Club? <br>  I loved it to!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You like romantic comedy right? Well here are some shows you will absolutly love!  I am 100% sure of it.<br>  <br>  1. Special A<br>  2. Lovely Complex<br>  3. Shugo Chara<br>  4. The Wallflower<br>  5. Skip Beat! <br>  6. Romeo x Juliet<br>  7. Sauinkoku Monogatari<br>  8. Kare Kano<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I loved every single of those shows. I know you will like them alot too!<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Sepcial A <br>  Hikari Hanazono has always been second to Kei Takishima. When they were six years old, their pro-wrestling loving fathers introduced them to each other. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, sporting events - anything. To do this, she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position. While Hikari considers Kei to be a rival and important friend, she is completely unaware that Kei loves her. The story primarily focuses on Hikari and her constant attempts to defeat her one and only rival, Kei, and how she finds love in their rivalry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_A" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_A</a><br>  <br>  2. Lovely Complx<br>  Lovely Complex is a love story between a boy and a girl. The girl, Risa Koizumi, is 172 cm (5' 8") tall—much taller than the average Japanese girl. The boy, Atsushi Otani, is 156 cm (5'1 and a half") —way below the height of the average Japanese boy. Because of this, they are called the "All Hanshin Kyojin" after a popular comedy duo that has a similar height difference.<br>  <br>  During summer school, a very tall student (from another class) shows up and Risa immediately falls for him, as she has had bad luck with boys in the past because she is tall. There is a girl that Atsushi likes as well, so Risa and Atsushi decide to put aside their differences and help each other get their love interests. But as they get to know each other better, Risa's feelings for Atsushi begin to blossom, and her love life gets complicated from there.<br>  <br>  One notable fact about Lovely Complex is that instead of speaking standard Japanese, almost all characters speak in Kansai-ben (the story takes place in Osaka).[4] While having one or two characters speaking Kansai-ben is common in many anime shows, having all characters doing so is unusual in media produced for a nationwide audience.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovely_Complex" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovely_Comp...</a><br>  <br>  3. Shuho Chara<br>  <br>  The heroine of the story, Amu Hinamori, is a student at Seiyo Elementary.[1] At first glance, her classmates deem her "cool and spicy" and rumors speculate about her personal life. However, her real personality is that of a very shy girl who has trouble showing her true personality. One night, Amu wishes for the courage to show her "would-be" self, and the next morning finds three brightly colored eggs—red, blue, and green—in her bed. At first, she is alarmed, but realizes she must have really wished to change. These eggs hatch into three Guardian Characters: Ran, Miki, and Su. The Guardian Characters aid Amu in discovering who she truly is and help fulfill Amu's dreams. Amu's life becomes much more complex as she struggles to deal with her "would-be" selves and the Seiyo Elementary's Guardians, who recruit Amu as the Joker to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of peoples' dreams.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to able to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shugo_Chara" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shugo_Chara</a><br>  <br>  <br>  4. The wallflower<br>  <br>  The Wallflower is about a girl who was called "ugly" by a boy, the first and only person to whom she confessed her love. This incident sparks a life change, and as a result Sunako shuns all forms of beauty, both in herself as well as in life. Concerned by her change for the worst, Sunako's aunt, the owner of a beautiful mansion where four very handsome students live, offers the guys free rent in her mansion if they can turn Sunako into a "perfect lady" (referred to in Japan as the titular Yamato Nadeshiko).<br>  <br>  While the four of them manage to make Sunako physically beautiful enough to become a lady, the problem lies with her attitude and interests (which Sunako has no intention of changing). Up until the most recent release in the story, they've managed to convince Sunako's aunt that her niece is indeed a lady befitting the mansion in which they live (and prevent the rent from skyrocketing to triple the required amount). However, in reality, Sunako has not changed considerably.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wallflower_(manga)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wallflo...</a><br>  <br>  5. Skip Beat <br>  <br>  The story of Skip-Beat! is about Kyoko Mogami, a wistful yet cheery sixteen year-old girl who loves her childhood friend, Shotaro, but is cruelly betrayed and thus seeks revenge against him. She used to spend a lot of time at Shotaro's parents' inn and learned a lot about housekeeping, hostelry, and other feminine jobs (sewing, cooking, serving tea traditionally, etc.). Shotaro, not wishing to take over his parents' inn, becomes bored of living in Kyoto and decides to move to Tokyo to pursue a career in music. Sho, as he is called by his fans, asks Kyoko to leave high school in Kyoto Prefecture and her life behind to help him. Upon arrival in Tokyo, Kyoko lives an unreasonably frugal life, spending nothing on herself and doing whatever she can for the freeloading Sho, who eventually becomes ranked seventh in the top twenty most popular entertainers of Japan. One day, however, as Kyoko brings Sho his lunch at a company building, she overhears Shotaro complaining about her to his manager, saying that she is a boring and plain girl with no sex appeal that he'd like to cast away. He then proceeds to sweet-talk and flirt with his manager, in stark contrast to the cold and demanding attitude he usually exhibits towards Kyoko. Unlike other heroines in the same situation, Kyoko doesn't shed many tears when she learns that Sho thinks she's only good for housekeeping. Instead, her "Pandora's box" opens and she vows vengeance on Sho. Enraged, Kyoko attempts to attack Sho, but is instantly carried off by security. Sho mockingly tells her that if she wants revenge, she had better become a bigger star than him. And so, Kyoko, vowing revenge, changes her appearance and enters the entertainment business, facing many challenges along the way. Skip Beat! follows Kyoko's journey to climb the showbiz ladder as she meets interesting people, in the hopes of getting revenge on Shotaro, but also in order to get back her sense of compassion that she had lost when her heart was broken by Sho.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Beat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Beat</a><br>  <br>  6. Romeo x Juliet<br>  <br>  In the fantastical aeropolis of Neo Verona, the noble house of Capulet had ruled peacefully for generations - until fourteen years ago, when the ancient grudge held by the rival house of Montague led to a mutiny, and the Capulets were deposed and all wiped out in a bloody coup. Now, as Neo Verona suffers under the thrall of its new masters, the fates of two star crossed lovers are about to become tragically entwined... As the citizens of the city suffer, the Capulet clan struggles to strike a blow against their enemies, and the Montagues tighten their grasp on power, an unlikely love blossoms between Romeo and Juliet - but in the face of such adversity, this ill-fated love may be doomed from the outset. Triumph or tragedy; only fate knows what awaits Romeo and Juliet...<br>  <br>  A young girl, Juliet, is the only member of her family to escape the massacre of the Capulet family at the hands of Laertes Montague. Fourteen years later, Lord Montague rules the land of Neo-Verona with an iron-fist as Juliet helps the common folk in a Robin Hood-like fashion, and Romeo Montague protests his father's cruelty. Juliet and Romeo meet by coincidence at the Rose Ball and fall in love at first sight. However, when Juliet turns sixteen and learns the truth of her past that has been hidden from her for fourteen years, her love becomes conflicted between revolution and devotion.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_X_Juliet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_X_Jul...</a><br>  <br>  7. Sauinkoku Monogatari<br>  Set in the fictional empire of Saiunkoku, the story centers on Shurei Ko, a descendant of a noble family that has fallen on hard times.<br>  <br>  Her father works as a librarian in the Imperial palace, a post which offers prestige and respect, but little compensation. Shurei teaches in the temple school and works odd jobs to make ends meet, but her dream is to pass the imperial examinations and take a post in government, a path forbidden to women.<br>  <br>  Shurei's plans come to an abrupt halt when the Emperor's Grand Advisor makes a startling offer for her to join the imperial household for six months as the young Emperor's consort and teach the Emperor to be a responsible ruler. If she succeeds, the financial reward will be great.<br>  <br>  The story details Shurei's growing relationship with the Emperor and other members of the court, the intrigues of imperial politics, and her commitment to better herself and her country.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Saiunkoku" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_o...</a><br>  <br>  Shurei Ko is the daughter and only child of Shoka ko of the ko clan, one of the two most powerful clans in Saiunkoku. She is sixteen years old when the story begins. As a descendant of the direct line, she has the title hime, which means 'princess' or 'lady'. Despite the high social status of her clan, Shurei grew up in relatively impoverished circumstances.

As she practices her pieces, Kahoko is amazed that she can play any piece on the violin as long as she knows the tune and plays it with her heart.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin'iro_no_Corda" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin'iro_no_...</a>|`|LSn5iF47aa	Vampire Knight~ comedy, romance, vampires, horror<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/vampire-knight/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/vampire-k...</a><br>  Vampire Knight Guilty<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/vampire-knight-guilty/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/vampire-k...</a><br>  Itazura na Kiss~ comedy, romance, drama<br>  Kare Kano<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/kare-kano/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/kare-kano...</a><br>  Lovely Complex<br>  <a href="http://www.animeseason.com/lovely-complex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.animeseason.com/lovely-comple...</a><br>  Saiunkoku Monogatari<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/saiunkoku-monogatari/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/saiunkoku...</a><br>  Saiunkoku Monogatari II<br>  Shugo Chara! <br>  Shugo Chara Doki! <br>  Fruit Basket <br>  Special A<br>  The Wallflower<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/yamato-nadeshiko-shichi-henge/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/yamato-na...</a><br>  Maria?Holic<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/maria-holic/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/maria-hol...</a><br>  La Corda D'Oro ~primo passo~<br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/kiniro-no-corda/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/kiniro-no...</a><br>  La Corda D'Oro ~secondo passo~ <br>  Skip Beat!<br>  <a href="http://www.animeseason.com/skip-beat/" rel="nofollow">http://www.animeseason.com/skip-beat/</a>|`|55V5cJoNaa	-Naruto (and of course Shippuden):<br>        Naruto Uzumaki, an adolescent ninja who constantly searches for recognition and aspires to become a Hokage, the ninja in his village that is acknowledged as the leader and the strongest of all.<br>  <br>  -Bleach:<br>     The adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he accidentally obtains the power of a shinigami—a Japanese death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from Rukia Kuchiki.

Because at least your offering the little guys a line, asking them, "Do you want to be eaten?" and they get to choose for themselves so its only their fault. It's like swimming in shark-infested water: your practically presenting yourself up for grabs on your own choice, and when your fishing at least were not forcing the little guys to be eaten, were giving them the choice to swim away :) But I hate people who hunt, just buy your food at the supermarket for gods sakes! Unless you live in the middle of nowhere I see no reason to hunt. Your not even giving the animals a chance at life, your not even warning them, you just kill it. But if someone has to hunt, I would prefer if they used everything they can, like the indians. They used the meat for food, the fat for running a fire, the skins as clothes and the bones as fishing poles, frames of houses and so much more... They didn't waste any part of the animal! Sorry for the long answer, by the way ;) my choice is fishing!|`|X8riDZBqaa	Fishing!|`|lmvA9Ei9aa	Fishing =D|`|YKSF6aoraa	hunting,, i want some venison.|`|ZffhZmVGaa	both|`|mYeq5AvFaa	fishing|`|70Fmh3Vbaa	huntin|`|AOPuoo16aa	Hunting|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	FISHING|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	fishing sounds more safer.!|`|6pk6HnuSaa	hunting ?|`|lwJF5DhHaa	fishing|`|qxteTM9Kaa	both

Great story. Directed at teens. And he was all of a 16-17 yr old himself, at first.  No parents.  Raised by his aunt & uncle -- who is killed by a criminal that Peter Parker could have stopped if he wasn't being a self-centered smart-azz at the time... Strong, resonating lesson in RESPONSIBILITY and self-sacrifice -- doing it all for nothing. Creates/invents his own web-shooters & shows great learning & focus and smarts.  Human, self-depreciating. Unsure of himself. Still strong after 46 years. So powerful, it can carry through to make 3 films blockbusters by the $100s of millions and not be hoaky (on the value of the main story).

The movies I got to watch at that age were scary but quite tame. Polterguist by Steven Speilburg was one of my favourites (there are 3 of the polterguist films so it worked well for my parents to spread out my "reward" of getting to watch scary movies) from memory Polterguist 1 was the most tame, it is still M rated however, but if you are willing to supervise the watching of the film. Other films such as Gremlins <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/</a> , Tremors <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/</a> , Rose Red <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259153/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259153/</a> , Ghostbusters is always a good one. It sounds as though you are looking for films that are scary due to their classic merits such as story, plot and context rather than films that are scary due to blood, viloence, gore and special effects. For this sort of quality of film it might be worth looking at the older movies, Tales from the Crypt <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096708/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096708/</a> has a whole series of films. While they do use gore slightly as a cheap thrill back then the special effects were really not advanced enough to make the gory parts disturbing and were seen mainly as humerous - these films are intelligent and are a mix of sci fi and horror, they are based on an old comic book so are quite novel to children within the age range you described, even better the Tales from the Crypt films are set out as a heap of mini films compiled so there is a variety of tales so these films are good at keeping children's attention spans fulfilled. Other films that I can think of are Jaws, and then if you really want to show the kids that they can be scared without the necessity of fast paced blood and guts you have the very old classics (I used to be quite skeptical about watching these movies as a child due to their age (and some being in black and white) however my Dad put it to me in a way that got me to watch the films and feel glad that I did afterwards, films I am speaking of include The Birds, Rear Window and alot of other Alfred Hitchcock films. Also classics like Frankenstein. My all time favourite and a film that may fit your criteria quite well is Buffy the Vampire Slayer (not the tv series originally this was a movie and a great one) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103893/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103893/</a> I hope all of this helps, visiting your local library is often good too for they have quite alot of classic scary films that are not so drowned in blood and gore and more tasteful. Hope you enjoy some of these fims and that I have helped you in what you are looking for.

Their opinions dont really matter to me. my mum gets really annoyed with me because i wont sing to her, but i think it helps if you practise with your friends, starting off with your back turned away from them and maybe one at a time because then you arent paranoid about them sniggering ;P <br>  do you have another friend that sings, because you could practise with her and then maybe do duets for your friends. also if you get singstar out with everyone, then it will really make your confidence grow.<br>  WOW i am really scared right now actually. hahah. <br>  bye|`|AtnG7RkYaa	It's perfectly normal to feel this sensation. The idea that your friends are always "there" with you and could "make a comment" is quite frightening. The only way to overcome this is probably to talk to your friends about how you feel. I'm sure they would understand.<br>  <br>  If anything, just think happy thoughts. Your friends will always be there for you and you should enjoy performing to them because I'm sure they love it and will stick up for you right or wrong.<br>  <br>  You just have to get yourself into the correct frame of mind and most importantly, ENJOY YOURSELF!

YIcBd569aa	modern technology, and editing. they simply edit out the back ground nose, also the mics they are using can diffuse some of the nose too. you know in the movies they don't add sound until the movie has been shot. at least that is the way they used to do it. but with computers these days they can do just about anything to make the scene quiet. and also don't forget the people in the background are more likely a bunch of extras (actors) who are part of the show. so modern technology and the magic of editing is your answer. on some dvd's they will take you on a behind the scenes look at the filming of the movie and you will get to see just how they made everything happen. I don't know if 90210 has that special feature on its dvd. but you can always rent it and see.

PqtUe6mjaa	The thing about Jazz in itself is that it's in many cases a sporadic art from. Playing Jazz requires you to know different scales and chord structures. I know a lot of snobby jazz musicians myself. It seems to me that because they're playing a genre of music that many think of as "classy" but is less popular than say Rock, and then add the fact that in order to play jazz well you really have to know your stuff...it seems as though many look down on other artists. It's kind of like music's yacht club|`|eciuBRZ7aa	In my opinion, not all jazz musicians are stuck up. The ones who are stuck up usually don't end up doing something special, and they know it. This is why they act like they've got a stick up their ***. Speaking as a jazz musician myself, those people typically show up at competitive places. When I just jam with my buddies, I have more fune and no one tries to say they are the best. But, maybe I am just "stuck up" as you put it.|`|cddbc5ce032708ac06f5a70e27defe3faa	find jazz musicians with attitudes that match your own. i have been in some not so high pressure situations. there are all kinds of jazz musicians of all levels. just practice on your own until you find musicians with the same goals you have|`|AA10526119	They aren't, just the people you hang with.

You could try going to a different place if you just can't deal with it but sometimes you just have be the bigger man (sometimes it's your only Choice if you wanna jam). But there are also allot of nice guys out there. Allot of the pros turn out to be pretty cool actually.

0vm66wlcaa	Well, to answer your question, yes it is.<br>  <br>  BUT:<br>  <br>  If you think you might be getting into Led Zeppelin a lot in the future, you should get the original albums. I bought Mothership, but now Led Zeppelin is my favorite band. I could have spent the money that I spent on Mothership on the originals, which are MUCH better. I would suggest you first get either 'Led Zeppelin' or 'Led Zeppelin II' first.<br>  <br>  Mothership is a great start, but I'm sure you could also just look on youtube to get a start too.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just a note<br>  The songs on Mothership were all picked by John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant, the three remaining members of Led Zeppelin.

1A992ofFaa	"You're on an island and desperately need to get off alive. There are 2 caves in front of you. One cave tunnels under the ocean somehow and leads to safety, and the other cave leads to certain death. There are 2 people standing in front of you. You know that one always tells the truth, and one always lies, but you can't tell which person is which. Both people know which way leads to safety and which one to certain death. You have one question to ask one of them in order to figure out how to get off the island alive. What is the question?"<br>  <br>  Okay, the riddle says that you can ask one "question" but it does not say how many "comments" or "commands" you can make (You have one question to ask one of them in order to figure out how to get off the island alive.). Ask one of the dudes if he is standing in front of you (There are 2 people standing in front of you). If he says no then he is obviously the liar .

i5YJBqnZaa	If you like ELP's Brain Salad Surgery album. Get their live "Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends" album. You will sit for a couple of hours in musical nirvana. <br>  <br>  I am going to give my age away here by telling you that I saw ELP every time they played here in SoCal. And we are talking a heck of a lot of concerts starting close to 40 years ago. Their studio recordings are of the same quality of Pink Floyd's. But their live shows had to be seen to be believed. Many people have seen the Cal Jam recording where Keith plays the piano while it is lifted above the stage and then rotates. But that was nothing compared to when he would stab his equipment with knives. Elicting some of the most remarkable sounds you can imagine. And while he would be doing this Carl would keep the beat going strong. Keith is one of the greatest keyboard players in rock music history (IMHO). <br>  Every concert ELP performed showcased each individual's musical talent at one point. Greg would usually play Lucky Man, Still You Turn Me On, From The Beginning, and maybe one more song. Then Keith would come on for piano improvisations for a while. After which Carl would destroy the audience with his prowess on the drums.<br>  Even though their live recordings are great. These were concerts that had to be experienced.<br>  I would list my favourite ELP studio recordings as follows:<br>  Emerson, Lake & Palmer<br>  Trilogy<br>  Brain Salad Surgery<br>  Tarkus<br>  Works Volume 1<br>  Black Moon<br>  Works Volume 2<br>  In The Hot Seat<br>  Love Beach<br>  <br>  Live recordings:<br>  Welcome Back My Friends<br>  Pictures At An Exhibition<br>  Works Live<br>  <br>  And there are many more. If you are really interested in their work, there is a series of recordings "The Original Bootleg Series" that covers a great many concerts over the years.|`|gR8InoqFaa	All those are great, but I cut my teeth for ELP on "from the beginning" and "lucky man".

Ginga Densetsu Riki might be ok for continuity''s sake and would only require a typically lengthed OVA. Lots of Yoshihiro Takahashi's mangas could be made into decent animes, though unlikely due to their age and rather limited fanbase (in comparison to DN, Naruto, FMA, etc).<br>  <br>  Naturally, Studio DEEN shouldn't be part of ANY of them.

She's going to loose Noah with her hard punishment ( IF she's not jailed first for shop lifting ( I wonder if the Genoa City Police Dept. has a maternity wing ) ???<br>  <br>   I'm thinking this soap is getting as bad as Bold & Beautiful with all the wife/girlfriend swapping going on< Shame on them >|`|qWzN3i3Uaa	Can Billy take a break for once. He has hooked up with four women from the show and he just got back in like September.

I do think that Sharon is going to wind up pregnant and its going to be a who's the daddy drama all over again. I think it will be Billy's...what a mess! Good thing he said he wants to be a father! Like you i really didnt expect billy and sharon to go at it again. I also think they are going to get caught this time...Jack did say he was going to stop by. That will be great!

K0iFV73Gaa	Lil Wayne looks like a haman crack house! TI wrote his whole first album in jail in his head. That is talent. He also wrote the whole second album by himself. Lil Wayne doesn't do that. TI is also doing community service on an MTV show so he can get a shorter sentence. It shows he wants to be a good person. Lil Wayne I'm sure wouldn't do that. TI is a dad I six even though he's not 30 yet. Still a cool guy! UNO?|`|sRKO8s6jaa	Dead and Gone is a really good song =).

Ow3O7h4caa	Aside from the other answers, Moon in 7th would indicate environmental ties to be of importance; it also shows the person seeking public popularity and one who is very responsive to other people's emotinoal needs. note that this is a good position for a consultant or therapist.<br>  Moon in male chart would indicate more a male seeking a Mother Image in his partner.<br>  On a relationship level, Moon in 7th also indicates a tendency to an early marriage as well as a need for cloe interdependence with all partners.|`|ad2faoKcaa	The Moon in the seventh house, means the mother is seen as a close friend and someone who is committed to relationships.<br>  <br>  The native may have been nurtured through heart to heart talks, hugs and personal interaction. They will continue to nurture themselves through relationships, and will tend to feel insecure if they do not have a significant other in their life. They need to be careful of a tendency to be too emotional or needy in relationships. There may also be a habit of falling in love too easily and then going from partner to partner, instead of patiently waiting for the right person.|`|67BjmuWUaa	It means that you want a partner that will  nurture and mother you.<br>  Also you do not see your partner clearly.
35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	Ok she isn't dead just seriously injured cause Kishimoto has a habit of making a character almost die and then returns healthy. Just like Kakashi, alot of people thinks he's dead but i don't think so he's just out of chakra and it wasn't clear which part of Hinata's body did Pain stabbed, it could be her leg or arms and remember that Pain is concentrated on Naruto for now so why would he bother to even concentrate on Hinata? He probably just stabbed his chakra piercings on her like what he did to Naruto.|`|hzH75VDXaa	She's always been my favorite character from Naruto, so my love of her hasn't grown. It couldn't get any bigger, lol.<br>  <br>  Her actions show just how deep her love is, and I can't wait for the next chapter since I'm sure she isn't dead.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	After Naruto,Hinata is my fav character.She tries her hardest to become stronger and she's always doing her best.And i like her even more after i saw what she did.She's great!And don't know why so many people hate her.|`|yap35HbDaa	I like Hinata!<br>  She's shy but she's also determind.<br>  I love her personality.|`|EDOG6DSOaa	Hey dude I don't hate Hinata but I would rather like Sakura to be with Naruto. If Hinata ends up with Naruto I wont be mad but sakura is the logical one. I you read Suzuka you would agree. Also if you chose Sakura it opens up anouther plot with both Hinata and Lee trying to break them up. And there is no way in hell that Hinata is dead. In fact I acually think there all dead but if you destroy the legenday eye everyone they kill comes back.|`|2DKRF3qoaa	Hinata is moved up on the rankings because of her actions, that should been done a long time ago, by her.  I always like her... but she really needed to jump out and showed her feeling from the start but that's why... we all need a shy girl in the crew.|`|dpAD1KoEaa	she's cute... in a shy childish way... i'll give her that... and the fact that she's saved my home boy Naruto more than once. but i'm not a totally devoted fan like you... I enjoy the sophisticated kick a** power of Tsunade more.|`|PeomCRDyaa	i like her character <br>  but they should really develop her character more...|`|eLFnR8yvaa	I love Hinata! I'm a big fan of hers.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	I can't help but think that you're doing something wrong if you feel the need to devote fully half of your post to preemptively attacking "haters" -- just throwing that out there.<br>  <br>  As for me, I'm a big fan of Lina Inverse.

420e0e2496807e15c86ec78f8ff9a5b3aa	Okay...here's my theory on this whole thing.  She's really Mrs. C but Jill's not her daughter as we all originally thought.  Marge is indeed dead.  You saw the episode where she was narrating "her" funeral?  Well, anyway Marge is gone...Jill is NOT her daughter.  Jill's DNA was the only one they used for the test which was dumb...Hello...she has a son!  But that also set us up for another storyline with Mrs. C and Jill.|`|955YoHvVaa	It's really Katherine, and Jill is not her real daughter..thats why the DNA was not a match..they should have just tested Brock because we know he is Mrs. C's son..and this whole story line could have ended this whole story line..the only scenes I saw on this were the two you mentioned..|`|uKXgg9heaa	I read on a few other Yahoo Answers that Jill is really not Katherine's daughter and that they would have to test Katherine's son. I wish they hurry up and figure it out I'm getting sick of this storyline.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	It is really Kay. Jill is not her daughter. I am hoping Brook and Mack will come in and get tested.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	The test just proved Jill and Mrs C aren't mother/daughter. When Mrs C is proven to be who she is, then the reality of the test will hit Jill.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i never saw them deliver the dna either. so, no you didn't miss anything. not sure what happened though, don't know if someone switched the dna results or if jill isn't really her daughter. we may find out eventually.
C7YbYUYPaa	He is incredibly underrated as a bass guitarist.  Most people probably couldn't even tell you what band he played for...<br>  <br>  Another One Bites the Dust and Under Pressure are two songs that basically cement his place in the top 10 bass guitarists ever in my opinion.<br>  <br>  BA1: You're My Best Friend<br>  BA2: I really like his overall Performance from the Magic tour at Wembley.  Never really jumped to the front of the stage, but you always knew he was there, and he really got into the music.<br>  BA3: I believe the first one he had was an Eko.<br>  BA4: He has a degree in electronics.|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	He is certainly an unsung hero in popular music.

Adding in here that i still prefer the originals by snow patrol. the one song of all time that should never be touched after the righteous brothers did it is unchained melody, unfortunately said x-factor contestants and their followers will insist on butchering and murdering it. ho-hum!!

8IXtuDZAaa	Actually, Christine Golden, an author that has written many ST novels as well as for the various ST series, has published a couple of novels post "Endgame".<br>  <br>  A publishing "relaunch" - which features stories placed after the end of Star Trek: Voyager was planned by Paramount. The novels take place after the series' conclusion. Several characters are reassigned while others are promoted but stay aboard Voyager; these changes include Janeway's promotion to admiral and Chakotay becoming captain of Voyager. The series also introduces several new characters.<br>  <br>  The series began with Homecoming and The Farther Shore in 2003 (by Christine Golden), a direct sequel to the show's final, "Endgame". These were followed in 2004 by Spirit Walk: Old Wounds and Spirit Walk: Enemy of My Enemy. Other novels -- some set during the relaunch period, others during the show's TV run -- have been published. There is also the "String Theory" 3-book series - very intelligently written.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it would be awesome if they could take the first two novels (The Farther Shore and Homecoming) and produce a movie out of it...all us trekkie fans dearly miss the camaraderie of the Voyager characters and would love to see them again!<br>  <br>  As for the fate of Voyager, she was made into a museum. The holographic Doctor did get recognition as a sentient being and even got married to a real person. Everyone was pardoned for crimes past and the doc's mobile emitter became part of him.<br>  <br>  As for my 2-cents about Endgame: Endgame was great - STV always did very well when dealing with time-space continuum and the whole time paradoxes. I didn't care how Chakotay wound up with Seven...(barf!). Everyone knows that after Resolutions, the Angry Warrior would always stand by the Woman Warrior's side....sigh....why couldn't they just hooked up when they got back to Earth...<br>  <br>  Also, there are sites out there for STV fan fiction - some simply written, some well written and then some just plain smut. I was really sorry to see the series end and fan fiction is just one way to keep Voyager alive!  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|CWUb6eTWaa	Ya that was the problem with End Game. The guys that wrote it forgot one small part of the story THE CREW! They spent the beginning of the episode about it but that time line doesn't exist. They would of been better off finishing the story properly by a movie instead of finishing the series the way they did. I am still upset about thast. There have probably been novels about what happened after that episode, but I don't know of any. There has not been any offical story though and it's been like that since 2001.|`|dh48AkbCaa	there was one publication in which chakotai and seven of nine broke up, and he later died.<br>  <br>  janeway became an admiral, and appeared as a cameo in "nemesis".<br>  <br>  harry kim reunites with his girlfriend libby.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Mai...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Main_P...</a>|`|9SvyCQ26aa	check this out. don't know if it's any good or not?<br>  might be the answer your looking for.<br>  would be nice if they made it into a movie.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Homecoming-Star-Trek-Voyager-Book/dp/074346754X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Homecoming-Star-Tr...</a>|`|ba52jQHyaa	These are two fan fiction short stories about Janeway's return to Earth.

There are quite a few books which continue the voyages of the Voyager crew from "Endgame" on to "Present Day", keeping the Crew in sync with al the rest of the crews from TNG & DS9. In fact, if your a fast reader, I suggest you take a look at psiphi.org for a list of all the Voyager books written post-"Endgame", & read them over the next month, because on March 31, the release of the brand new Voyager book, the 1st of 2 due out this year, continues the adventure of Voyager & Crew. Some Very Very Good books! Enjoy!
tjGFRs1Kaa	Yes, it's normal. Everyone has different interests and everyone likes different types of music.

uUDNcsyUaa	Incredibly talented musicians, especially the drummer and guitar players.  Overall as a band I would say they are pretty good but nothing too special.  The War Within was for sure a great album and a must have for any metal lover.  <br>  <br>  To me they kinda get boring after awhile, they tend to write all their songs in the same manner and aren't very versatile.  But I do still listen to them from time to time and think they have some very worthy material.|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Wow I haven't listened to them in a long time. I remember they did a song for Rob Van Dam (WWE) and he left like 3 years ago.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I already know of them. They are pretty decent In my opinion.

Dr2JjGIfaa	How many of these 20 random music facts will you already know? Read on to find out. Most of these facts are about the UK charts.<br>  <br>  It was way back in 1857 that Leon Scott (a French scientist) found a way to record sound on to paper that had been blackened with candle wax. This invention was called a ‘phonoautograph'.<br>  <br>  Twenty years later the phonograph was invented by Thomas Edison. It recorded the sound on to wax cylinders.<br>  <br>  Ten year later, in 1887, Emil Berliner went one better, by adapting Edison's idea to work on a flat wax disc and thus the LP was born. <br>  <br>  Berliner's Gramophone Company went on to become EMI.<br>  <br>  It was 1952 when the first UK singles charts appeared. Listing only the sales of 78s. The first number one on the chart was Here In My Heart by Al Martino.<br>  <br>  It was the Dutch company Philips who developed the cassette tape as a mechanism for recording dictations in offices. In 1963 they made their debut as a means of getting music to the masses.<br>  <br>  The CD (compact Disc) was released widely released to the public for music in 1983.<br>  <br>  The song ‘Spirit In The Sky' has been taken to number one in the UK on three separate occasions by three different artists. Norman Greenbaun, who wrote the song, released the original in 1970, followed by Doctor and the Medics version in 1986. Gareth Gates took the song to the top spot in 2003.<br>  <br>  Not the only song to hit the top spot on three different occasions though. The Beatles song ‘With A Little Help From My Friend' was never released as a single by the Fab Four but still managed to reach number one in the UK three times. Firstly for Joe Cocker in 1968, then by Wet Wet Wet in 1988. Finally hitting the top spot for Sam and Mark in 2004.<br>  <br>  Talking about the Beatles. When the double A side ‘Penny Lane'/'Strawberry Fields Forever' only reached number 2 in 1967 it was their first song not to hit the top spot in the UK since ‘Please Please Me' in 1963. The song that kept it off number one was ‘Please Release Me' by Engelbert Humperdink.<br>  <br>  Roger Daltrey (he of the ‘Who' fame) sang the song that was used as the theme tune for the TV programme CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. He also appeared in one episode as a Vegas boss called Mickey Dunn.<br>  <br>  The Droogs, Moloko, Orange Mecanique, Malchicks and Heaven 17 all took their names from the film ‘A Clockwork Orange'.<br>  <br>  Could you name a song that has been number one in the UK in four different years? Well that is exactly what happened with the song ‘Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen. Originally released in 1975, it hit the top spot at the tail end of November and was still there in early 1976. After lead singer, Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, the song was re-released, hitting number one in December of that year and holding on until late Janury of 1992.<br>  <br>  The Jackie Wilson song ‘Reet Petite' was originally released in 1957 but eventually hit number one in the UK charts in 1986. 29 years and 42 days after the original release.<br>  <br>  Louis Armstrong holds the record of oldest chart topper. Having reached number one in the UK in 1968 with the song ‘What A Wonderful World'. He was 67 at the time.<br>  <br>  Simon & Garfunkel, one of the most famous duos of all time, were originally called Tom & Jerry.<br>  <br>  AC/DC hold the record for most singles without managing to hit the top ten in the UK having released 29 singles. (Upto the year 2009)The first song recorded by rocker Jon Bon Jovi was actually a song called ‘R2-D2: We Wish You A Merry Christmas' for an album called the Star Wars Christmas Album. He was only 17 at the time.<br>  <br>  Diana Ross appeared on at least one hit single every year between 1964 and 1996, an incredible 33 years.<br>  <br>  Although most people think that the UK chart is only a top 40 (as that is what is broadcast on the radio) it is actually a top 75. An ultimate one-hit wonder would be one that manages to hit that number 75 spot before dropping away immediately. Famous Hollywood actor Anthony Hopkins released a song called ‘Distant Star' in the UK in 1986. It hit number 75 for one week then disappeared.<br>  <br>  When the song ‘Spaceman' by Babylon Zoo was used in a Levi's Jeans advert in 1995 it was always going to be destined for number one in the UK. The part used in the advert was the very start of the song which sounds as if the song will be a dance song. Many people bought the song because of this only to take it home and play it, just to find it was actually a rock song. Other songs to hit the top after being used in their ad include, ‘The Joker' by the Steve Miller Band, ‘Inside' by Stiltskin and ‘Boombastic' by Shaggy.|`|b17592fed8d273ceda591464162c5148aa	- Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain were all 27 years old when they died.<br>  <br>  - Jimi Hendrix was thrown out of high school for holding the hand of a white girl in class.<br>  <br>  - David Bowie proposed to his first wife Angie by saying ’’Can you handle the fact that I don’t love you?’’<br>  <br>  - Gene Simmons of Kiss has a tongue that is seven inches long.

When the busboy brought our water and utensils, I observed that he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket.  Then I looked around and saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets. When the waiter came back to serve our soup I inquired, 'Why the spoon?'<br>  <br>  'Well', he explained, 'the restaurant's owner hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all of our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour.  If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift..'<br>  <br>  As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he replaced it with his spare. 'I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now.' I was impressed. <br>   <br>  I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly.  Looking around, I saw that all of the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So, before he walked off, I asked the waiter, 'Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?'<br>  <br>  'Oh, certainly!' Then he lowered his voice. 'Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also learned that we can save time in the restroom.  By tying this string to the tip of our you-know-what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39%.<br>  <br>  I asked quietly, 'After you get it out, how do you put it back?'<br>  <br>  'Well,' he whispered, 'I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon'.|`|EAa9jDuGaa	knock knock:<br>  who's there:<br>  been:<br>  been who:<br>  been there done that.
hP2nzb2haa	Look in your Phone Book... However, for around $100, good luck! That not going to happen. If you still wanted to go cheap... I suggested to start asking around at high school and start asking friends if they know anyone is a DJ, post it on the bulletin board at school. When you found a DJ, check him out if he is good and what you have in mind... never pay up front. You made get rip-off. If you hire him always have a back up.... start making/downloading music to an ipod and get a big speaker... when doing this put the music in order how you want the evening be. Now, to look in a phone book under "Disc Jockeys" or/and Wedding Panning" ( it in there, too sometimes) to check out more DJ... good luck. <br>  Oh ya... ask the ballroom coordinator if she/he can recommend you one. Coordinator is good at giving you some tips on how you want your party to be especially since you're using his/her ballroom... go for it.

yU2WHyvgaa	You should learn to get over your fear before you try out.  Just remember that the people in the audience can't sing better than you, so you can show off. They shouldn't criticize you if they can't sing. ANd even if they do, who cares? There will be critics. But that's what comes with showbiz. The best thing i can say to you is get over it. Not everyone will love you.<br>  You should post a video.<br>  For the main part, just sing in front of people in your school, you will get betterr|`|cETQuE9waa	Why don't you get involved with chorus at your school?

gGZz2EGyaa	I am glad I read your question I already thought I was heating the whole street up. I have to be honest this time the bill was not as high as I though it would be, still flipping high, but not enough to sigh and faint this time.<br>  The day after the bill arrived a rival company phoned me and offered me cheaper gas & electric, oh good I replied are you giving it away for nothing.  Slight cough and panic from telesales person, well no.  Okay then I am not interested but thank you for your call.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Yes it,s scandalous and i only use candle,s|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Last winter my bill was incorrect, and equivalent to about 3 years usage for me, in a single quarter. The mistake was eventually rectified. If you are nice to them it helps. First I had the meter out, then they said the bill stood, and there was no proof the meter was wrong. I just implored them to use common sense and logic to work out the correct bill, which they did, to their credit.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Yes. they say the prices have to go up then the utility companies announce record profits.

I moved to the bottom floor apartment of another place with tiles and shades and a big tree on one side.  Now it is about $180.  I think I need a heavier shade in one room and I could get it down more.  We are going to get a special plug for the living room appliances and turn all those off at night to see if that helps.|`|3029b27a303de71c5528ee94f4bb098baa	i know what you mean.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Yes true.|`|Bh6NwFzeaa	Everybody`s complaining about their energy bills.

dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Gemini on the cusp of the 12th with ruling mercury in Sag in the 5th.  If I told you who are my hidden enemies, then it wouldn't be a hidden anymore - I couldn't do that. lol ......would you?<br>  <br>  -wondering about Uranus?  and if moon is in the 11th or 12th?  not prying.......just wondering~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Edit: -very interesting.  Aquarius being in the 12th with ruling Uranus in the 7th, which I'll accept as the house of open enemies; besides  maybe the ironic obvious, I would imagine that those who utilize computers and internet would be a source of hidden and open enemies.  hmmmmm...........   and with moon in Aquarius there also, other than the obvious of what the moon represents, you might find comfort in fighting people (Mars?) in that domain, so to speak.<br>  <br>  I wonder why I was given those TDs.......hmmmmm?!|`|uel6NBOVaa	Libra is on the cusp of my 12th house, and in it are my Sun, Mercury, and Mars. I guess that means that I'm my own worst enemy.
c6Rb8f3Gaa	Both open enemies and partners basically stand for the figure of the "opposing force".<br>  <br>  There are times when that force is complementary (thus, what you get is a mate) and others when that force is too different to co-exist with you (thus, what you get is an "enemy"...and it is an "open" one because the way you oppose each other is striking and felt by both of you). This could be better understood/felt in case you have any 1st-7th house oppositions which are activated by conjunctions (and therefore, oppositions) in synastry.<br>  <br>  Besides, as they say, the line between love and hate is not easily distinguished. No wonder why so many love affairs start off as cases of rivalry and vice versa...(what comes to my mind right now as a *typical* example of this is either Pluto or Mars in the 7th...lots of  potential "clashes" there and a certain tendency for need of domination-either of the person or of their partner)<br>  <br>  The difference between 7th house enemies and 12th house enemies is that while a 7th house enemy can be the opposite side of your coin (you're made of the same "material", but just can't see eye to eye), a 12th house enemy is your joker card...it is and it isn't, it exists and it doesn't (Neptune is in court here- think of this pair of opposing fishes). As a result, since 12th house enemies are much more vague for you to define, you have less ways of relating to them and, of course, even less chances of *acknowledging* them. That's why most of them do not correspond with "tangible" dangers, but rather with psychological and certainly subconscious ones.|`|3NwVAhCEaa	The connection of the 7th house with open enemies goes back to medieval astrology and contrasts with the 12th house as the house of hidden enemies. Much of the astrology from that period had a negative, fatalist tone to it. Modern astrology referrs to the 7th as the house of relationships, not enemies. <br>  <br>  Once you get past the black and white thinking that the very old astrology used, it actually does show insight. We tend to romanticize the 7th house by calling it the house of marriage and social fulfullment. However, everyone knows that relationships run the gammet, from totally disfunctional and dangerous to wonderful and positive in every way. <br>  <br>  I look at it this way: calling the 7th the house of open enemies reminds me that there are many relationships that are openly hostile and require a lot of time and energy to manage. It's the fact of relating, not just enjoying it that defines 7th house matters. For me, it just puts the meaning of the 7th into a more powerful light that includes all relationships that have to faced directly and out in the open.<br>  <br>  jack h|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	that is the other side to the seventh house.. i believe it has something to do with polarity (of libra being aries). That is to say you have an aries-libra polarity within yourself nad the energy of aries is also a part of the seventh house.. i don't really know too much about this aspect of the birth chart... interesting question|`|TdyI4VWzaa	No idea lol i have Venus in house 7 of my chart and ive heard thats the best aspect, although id like to know what it means about open enemies if thats true.|`|KQjhOdsIaa	i have no idea?|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	I have always considered the 8th house the house of open enemies.<br>  <br>  My mate is a Gemini

Also, anime tends to cut out things sometimes. <br>  <br>  2) What are your top 10 favorite anime/manga shows/stories and why?<br>  <br>  1 - Fruits Basket - in depth characters, dark, yet sweet and hopeful too. <br>  <br>  2 - Ouran High School Host club - Just really really funny and cute...<br>  <br>  3 - Lovely Complex - the couple, tall girl and short guy goes agains the norm and is unique. It's also really funny and sweet. <br>  <br>  4 - Hana Kimi - just a really good romance and situation that would never happen in real life being portrayed in a manga<br>  <br>  5 - Kare Kano - really deep, dark characters and good character development. Also happy endings all around<br>  <br>  6 - Nana - just a really good romance<br>  <br>  7 - Tokyo Crazy Paradise - again something that wouldn't happen in real life<br>  <br>  8 - Nodame Cantabile - really funny and cute, also being exposed to classical music and compeitions and what not to do with it. <br>  <br>  9 - Ichigo Mashimaro - Just really funny. <br>  <br>  10 - Cat Street - orginal and unique characters put in a unique situation.<br>  <br>  3) wHo are your 5 most favorite anime characters and why?<br>  <br>  Koizumi Risa from Lovely Complex - she knows what she wants and goes for it and that requires a lot of courage<br>  <br>  Miyazawa from Kare Kano - she's intelligent and able, yet goes against stereotypes of weak and opinionless women<br>  <br>  Sohma Yuki from Fruits Basket - he's able to admit his weaknesses and know that they can't be overcome without work, effort, and time. He persists. <br>  <br>  Hikaru/Kaoru from OHSHC - just really funny characters<br>  <br>  Morita from Honey and Clover - just really funny and random<br>  <br>  4) Who are your top 5 favorite manga characters and why?<br>  <br>  same as #3<br>  <br>  5) What is your favorite type of anime/manga<br>  <br>  Comedy Romance, but comedy in general and deep romance too..<br>  <br>  6) Would you like to write your own anime/manga and if you would, what would it be about?<br>  <br>  not sure =P|`|LcSwDbr4aa	1.  Anime, I prefer to watch the visual images, plus it's fun listening to my favorite Voice Actors and Actresses bring the characters to life.<br>  <br>  2.  Full Metal Alchemist, Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Fate/Stay Night, .Hack/Sign, Ghost in the Shell, Grave of the Fireflies, Princess Mononoke, Trigun and Fruits Basket  (FMA, Cowboy Bebop and Neon Genesis Evangelion are probably the best anime titles EVER!, The rest are just entertaining and have great stories to them)<br>  <br>  3.  Shino Aburame, Vash the Stampede, Radical Ed, Edward Elric and Barrious (from Appleseed), They are all the coolest or most skilled characters I know of.<br>  <br>  4.  Don't really read manga so I can't answer this question<br>  <br>  5.  Action, Comedy, Dark/Sci-Fi (like Claymore and Ergo Proxy), light romance (like Fruits Basket)<br>  <br>  6.  I probably wouldn't mind but I'm not the best at drawing.  I've got a couple of awesome story concepts that would be entertaining and keep in line with my spiritual/religious beliefs.|`|mUchRkoCaa	1.While both are great in my opinion, I prefer manga because its original content and no filler<br>  2.1.Dragon Ball<br>    2.Full Metal Alchemist<br>    3.One Piece<br>    4.Naruto<br>    5.Akira<br>    6.Cowboy Bebop<br>    7.Rouroni Kenshin<br>    8.Tenchi Muyo!<br>    9.Lupin the 3rd<br>   10.Death Note<br>  3&4.Rather than answering two similar questions, i'll answer like this:<br>  1.Dragon Ball cast<br>  2.Full Metal Alchemist cast<br>  3.One Piece Cast<br>  4.Naruto cast<br>  5.Cowboy Bebop cast<br>  5.Action/Adventure<br>  6.I would write mine in the style of Akira Toriyama/Eiichiro Oda.<br>  Your welcome!^^|`|lwCRXwjoaa	anime it always gets to my head better when i see it happen<br>  <br>  i only have a top 1 DEATHNOTE because its the best<br>  <br>  L,light yagami,mello,near,and Teru Mikami because there all from death note plus there the best charactors in the anime<br>  <br>  all the ones i just said<br>  <br>  action<br>  <br>  not really|`|fgzZuuyHaa	1. Manga because the anime sometimes gets confusing and strays away from what the mangaka was trying to create.<br>  2. Cardcaptor Sakura, TRC, Junjou Romantica, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, RomeoxJuliet, Monster, Kekkaishi, because they all have different aspects that appeal to me.<br>  3 & 4. Sakura from CCS, Itachi from Naruto, Edward Elric from FMA, Hinata from Naruto, Light Yagami from Death Note because I can relate to them.<br>  5. I like most types of anime/manga.<br>  6. If I could, it would probably be a horror manga about a possessive spirit or something like that :/|`|6qpklGudaa	1. Manga.

Anime, but dubs only, because I dont like reading subtitles, and sometimes I get disappointed after reading a manga and the voice actors don't sound like I thought they would in the anime.<br>  <br>  2.Naruto, Naruto Shippuden, Pokemon, Death Note, Bleach, Blood Plus, Never Give Up(manga), Fruits Basket, Full Metal Alchemist and Paradise Kiss. Mostly because I like anime/manga in general.<br>  <br>  3.(All Naruto Characters) Naruto, because he has cool hair and a one-piece outfit. Sasuke, becuase he's obviously emo and cool. Kakashi, becuase he has an awesome might. Rock Lee, because he's awesome. Deidara, because he's my favorite Akatsuki member.<br>  <br>  4.Tohru from Fruits Basket, because shes kind and sweet. Miwako from Paradise Kiss, because you think shes a tiny little girl, but shes really much more, and shes sweet. Sakura from Cardcaptor Sakura, because shes a cute little kid fighting bad things lol. Hanajima from Fruits Basket because shes funny. Kyo from Fruits Basket because he gets mad really easily.<br>  <br>  5.My favorite is Naruto, because when I was first introduced to anime, it was Naruto that was my first (before I realized Pokemon and Sailor Moon were anime)<br>  <br>  6.Nope, I have no talent in drawing or writing stories whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Thank you.|`|ybjj5WIhaa	1) Which do you like better?<br>  Anime or Manga and why?<br>  >> manga....

LcSwDbr4aa	1.  It's has a really tightly knit story to it (even if it does stray from the manga source)  There are only like 2 episodes that can be considered  'fillers' (Full Metal vs. Flame, and the Mystery of Warehouse 13)<br>  2.  It is unique, dealing with the idea of alchemy being the 'ultimate' science, instead of physics.<br>  3.  It touches the heart;  If you don't feel any tinge of sadness with the events of Nina and Alexander or THE EVENT of Mae Hughes, you are a terrible person (enough said!)<br>  4.  It strikes a spiritual/religious chord; even if science is hailed as THE 'religion' of the day, spirituality and religion will always find a way to provail on its own, as discovered by Edward, within the first 4 episodes.<br>  5.  It bashes Nazis (you can never go wrong with this!)<br>  and Finally, it stresses the importance of friends and family, and always fighting for your dreams/goals.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Well, I like it because it has comedy. The characters are great. The plot is great.<br>  <br>  The anime and manga are different, but I still love both of them.|`|uctxzjIIaa	It's got a clear plot that moves consistently.<br>  <br>  A good blend of action, suspense, comedy, and a dab of romance here and there.<br>  <br>  A large selection of characters who are quite significant to the plot, have wildly varying personalities, but overall tend to be likeable.|`|AA11025703	Are you talking about the Manga or the Anime??<br>  <br>  I loved/love the Anime for a number of reasons.  Aside from periodic usage of Chibi art, the Art and Animation are quite good.<br>  I found the plot line gripping, and it touched on several events in my own life.<br>  I Really liked the fact that there wasn't Copious amounts of filler, or whole episodes with the characters standing around, thinking about what they might eventually do.  It was a short/sweet 51 episodes.<br>  <br>  As for the Movie, I hated it, not just the ending which apparently allot of fans disliked, I hated almost the whole movie.  Sadly I went to see it with the 2 directors IN the audience.  So I was very polite about it:D<br>  <br>  That said, there is a second Anime series coming out, which might be total crap, who knows:D<br>  <br>  As for the Manga, it's still running, and from what I've read of it, I like it allot, though it's Very different from the Anime.|`|bZsF1n0zaa	I think it's good. I like the storyline a lot...but I hear it wasn't similar to the original Manga and they're making a new Fullmetal Alchemist so I'm looking forward to watching that.<br>  <br>  It's not my favorite though. I stil think it was pretty good and too short... And I also liked the movie.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	everyone has their one Likings in anime. some peopLe Like naruto, some peopLe Like bLeach. in my opinion FMA is the greatest anime there is, but thats just my opinion.|`|MQx6fz8aaa	becuase its a good anime not a big fan of anime mostly cause i get out of my house unlike yall ******* losers but the few animes i do watch full metal alchemist is pretty good|`|sDhcMlLiaa	It's great because of the well-defined characters and storyline. A very good script ! And also that world that seems like the beginning of the XXth century, beautiful buildings in the anime, fantastically detalied, excellent music etc.<br>  <br>  + the true value of love... any kind  of love.<br>  <br>  Negative aspects: too much violence, too many characters killed, homunculus are different but by no reason since they eat little-philosopher-stones.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Actually it is full metal jacket and it is a great movie.  But hey, it is a life choice so don't fret over it so much.|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	proboally cuz of its amazing storyline, good action and lovely animation...are you sure you watched it?|`|T2vZu6F2aa	because it hilarious and i love edward|`|BqQMWF4Vaa	it just looks cool and has a good story line <br>  and different people like different things im more into naruto|`|092fdeb541685d46dec3a95586811f18aa	i'm a fan its a cult thing|`|vPbM2F13aa	i lke the manga cuz it rocks its like asking me why i like my favorite color|`|ucLUUSuwaa	Its a preey good anime cause it actually kinda relates to everday life like the character Envy,Gluttony,Lust,and the others it relates to some of the people in the world. Also Al and Elric have a good personality leading to a successful anime to watch with alot of action and the caring for a brother|`|cllgnQ53aa	the reason why everyone likes it so much is because its funny exciting and has a freakin bad *** plot to it. its just amazing. and the guy who made it was smart cause he added a mix of world war II but in another world which caught my eye. its very long but you have to have patience to get into it.

a1Ngi39Xaa	It was a little strange to me as well.  Maybe it's all a part of Jack's guidance he is giving her.  Perhaps she is trying to kill Victor with kindness to catch him off-guard.|`|LO3BMobRaa	Maybe she realizes that going up against Victor Newman can be fatal for her (LOL).|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I'm thinking.... Colleen is being nice to Victor because it's easier to get along with him than fighting. You've heard the old saying'' Keep your friends close and your enemy's closer''<br>  <br>   I thought it odd when Victor, Ashley & Billy stayed at 'her home' and had a family Pow-Wow<br>  <br>   I don't think the feud has even began yet ! This was just too quick to be settled ?|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah , that was weird. Maybe she knows she better get on Victor's good side.|`|AA10423186	it was    was    weird     collen    nice  to  victor|`|vEzdsqY3aa	i think in her case she knows to wooo him with kindness then go for the kill

In a statement, he said, “Our fans have been extremely dedicated, and season eight should prove to be a very satisfying reward.” It’s rumored that the final episodes will bring the character full circle, centering around the killer of Monk’s beloved wife.

Both good flick though.|`|r4ar5lekaa	I absolutely love Donnie Darko. It's such an amazing movie, and one of a kind. I think it's pretty ridiculous they're coming out with a sequel. It's the kind of movie that should have NO sequels. haha. But it's nice to know the director of the original one has nothing to do with the sequel, which is called S. Darko. I just looked it up on Wikipedia again too, and it looks like it's going to be released straight to video, and not even be in theaters. But maybe it will be in some, I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Fight Club was good, but my vote definitely goes to Donnie Darko.

akcGfgdcaa	He's acting in a 'Spinal Tap' type mockumentary, which is being directed by Casey Affleck.<br>  <br>  It's basically a joke movie where it says that Joaquin is retiring from acting to become a rap star. The interview on Letterman was all an act, and according to most reports that I've read, David Letterman was in on the joke, and during the ad breaks, Joaquin would remove the sunglasses and speak normally to Letterman.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Just because I don't know, but I would say maybe he is doing a documentary of sorts.

MzjNXLmlaa	It sucks that people think Danny will only win the pity vote.  I loved him from the start and didn't even realize his sad story until later on. I hope he wins because he's very talented.  I really thought his best friend had a great voice and I wanted to see more of him so I hope he'll come back next year....In short, I think Danny will win :)|`|RtHBnYSmaa	Danny sucks, but he'll win anyway with the pity vote. Also, I'm laughing at you right now. "Win it man!!!!!!" That's good stuff.|`|ltHslyCeaa	Either<br>  Allison Iraheta<br>  Danny Gokey<br>  Lil Rounds <br>  or<br>  Adam Lambert|`|bPDrN9NTaa	well so far since american idol started it has been going boy, girl, boy girl. last year a boy won so this year a girl will most likely win.<br>  <br>  i guess we'll have to wait and see (:|`|39323f708ae4eeca665692a228eaaf08aa	I didn't see Danny's performance because I didn't watch it that week but just by hearing what people say I really think he's going to go far in this season and be successful. But like another answer here said.....so far throughout the eight seasons of american idol the winners have been girl, boy, girl, girl, boy, girl, boy. I'm not sure who's going to win, we'll have to see.|`|QUrqswahaa	One of the 12 who will then drop off the face of the earth like Ruben, and Taylor did.

Its stuipid and people should read their bible more often.
4e11GJVZaa	"To Zanarkand" Was my favorite by far. The whole Zanarkand plot in FFX was remarkable because of the music. I also love "Liberi Fatali" from FFVIII, and who doesn't love the classic "One Winged Angel"?|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Man.. I love his compositions!  Esp the "To Zanarkand" Piano tune.. it fit the album perfectly... and is so beautiful.. it made me tear up a little bit when I was almost done with the game.  If you look at my Last Fm you can tell I listen to alot of his work.  I love most Final Fantasy music though, not just the compositions from him.  FF-XII did not feature him I believe, and that opening theme for that game was amazing.|`|VJAYmZQIaa	The only exposure I've had to his music would be through the games he worked on. I haven't played any Final Fantasy games in a long time (last one i played was 9) but I always liked the music in them. I've always found that good music really adds to the experience of a game. As a kid I could play Megaman 2 just to listen to music. Haha

LcSwDbr4aa	Cowboy Bebop, Full Metal Alchemist and Neon Geneis Evangelion are in my opinion, the best animes, rounding off the list would be Ghost in the Shell, Grave of the Fireflies and your choice of another Studio Ghibli film (Princess Mononoke, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away would be the most likely canidates).

Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, sporting events - anything. To do this, she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position. While Hikari considers Kei to be a rival and important friend, she is completely unaware that Kei loves her. The story primarily focuses on Hikari and her constant attempts to defeat her one and only rival, Kei, and how she finds love in their rivalry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_a..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_a.....</a><br>  <br>  2. Lovely Complx<br>  Lovely Complex is a love story between a boy and a girl. The girl, Risa Koizumi, is 172 cm (5' 8") tall—much taller than the average Japanese girl. The boy, Atsushi Otani, is 156 cm (5'1 and a half") —way below the height of the average Japanese boy. Because of this, they are called the "All Hanshin Kyojin" after a popular comedy duo that has a similar height difference.<br>  <br>  During summer school, a very tall student (from another class) shows up and Risa immediately falls for him, as she has had bad luck with boys in the past because she is tall. There is a girl that Atsushi likes as well, so Risa and Atsushi decide to put aside their differences and help each other get their love interests. But as they get to know each other better, Risa's feelings for Atsushi begin to blossom, and her love life gets complicated from there.<br>  <br>  One notable fact about Lovely Complex is that instead of speaking standard Japanese, almost all characters speak in Kansai-ben (the story takes place in Osaka).[4] While having one or two characters speaking Kansai-ben is common in many anime shows, having all characters doing so is unusual in media produced for a nationwide audience.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovely_comp..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovely_comp...</a><br>  <br>  3. Shuho Chara<br>  <br>  The heroine of the story, Amu Hinamori, is a student at Seiyo Elementary.[1] At first glance, her classmates deem her "cool and spicy" and rumors speculate about her personal life. However, her real personality is that of a very shy girl who has trouble showing her true personality. One night, Amu wishes for the courage to show her "would-be" self, and the next morning finds three brightly colored eggs—red, blue, and green—in her bed. At first, she is alarmed, but realizes she must have really wished to change. These eggs hatch into three Guardian Characters: Ran, Miki, and Su. The Guardian Characters aid Amu in discovering who she truly is and help fulfill Amu's dreams. Amu's life becomes much more complex as she struggles to deal with her "would-be" selves and the Seiyo Elementary's Guardians, who recruit Amu as the Joker to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of peoples' dreams.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to able to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shugo_chara..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shugo_chara...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  4. The wallflower<br>  <br>  The Wallflower is about a girl who was called "ugly" by a boy, the first and only person to whom she confessed her love. This incident sparks a life change, and as a result Sunako shuns all forms of beauty, both in herself as well as in life. Concerned by her change for the worst, Sunako's aunt, the owner of a beautiful mansion where four very handsome students live, offers the guys free rent in her mansion if they can turn Sunako into a "perfect lady" (referred to in Japan as the titular Yamato Nadeshiko).<br>  <br>  While the four of them manage to make Sunako physically beautiful enough to become a lady, the problem lies with her attitude and interests (which Sunako has no intention of changing). Up until the most recent release in the story, they've managed to convince Sunako's aunt that her niece is indeed a lady befitting the mansion in which they live (and prevent the rent from skyrocketing to triple the required amount). However, in reality, Sunako has not changed considerably.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_wallflo..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_wallflo...</a><br>  <br>  5.

E5pV0Kddaa	yeah its not bad. theres just one part where bella wants to "make love" to edward but its very subtle and nothing happens. its not bad at all. i know younger people who have read it|`|3MKjuJ4raa	I think that she should.One of my friends daughters was 10 when she read it and my friend didn't mind.It all depends on your parents.<br>  <br>  Eclipse doesn't really have bad themes.Breaking Dawn has more...mature themes (so tell your friend to borrow the book from the library,if her cousin really wants to read it).Breaking Dawn,in my opinion was very disappointing because it was not suitable for younger teens.I can only tell you that much, so tell your friends cousin to be wise and know when to move to another book.<br>  <br>  <3 Have fun reading!|`|lttblj8faa	I think Eclipse is very much appropriate. But, It depends on your friends parenting skills. If she is strick then maybe not, if she is religious eahh, it depends. but all around an 11 year old COULD read it. Its not horrible.<br>   I just think the child should stay away from Breaking Dawn at age 11 there is a lot going on during the honey moon part of the book the 11 year old child should not read.<br>  I hope this helps :]<br>  Good luck~|`|pEDavW3caa	well i read the whole series and i think would be okay for an 11 year old. if you want to be sure though then you could read the book first. but it's just about bella and edward trying to move on from the past. she goes through graduation but then she discovers her true feelings toward jacob. nothing much really. sorry if i ruined any parts for you.|`|UeGbG8Axaa	Yeah it is i have read them all, on the other hand i dont recommend Breaking Dawn for somone that age. (just cause the begining may be a little awkward for them, the rest is wonderful)|`|KIKUBbT6aa	Yes all the books are ok for that age range.<br>  The middle schools in my area can't keep them in the libraries cause kids are always checking them out!|`|yjwKCMcGaa	i think its appropriate why would it not be|`|IBRxXbBuaa	I don't think so. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't give anything specific but I think that she should only read up to New Moon. Towards the end of Eclipse it might be inappropriate. Read it yourself and see what you think. If she does read Eclipse, Breaking Dawn is definitely inappropriate.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Well, there is no bad language or any sexual content that goes into any detail so the book should be fine.<br>  The book also has a bit of bloody gore inside of it but nothing too disgusting or worth not letting an 11 year old read.<br>  <br>  The book is perfectly suitable.|`|PZwF4Nukaa	yes it is appropriate why not and if you don't think it is than go and start your puberty just go and start growing hair on your pussy and masturbate watch some p***<br>  <br>  <br>  just joking   i I'm not a pervert I'm just 13

vzvhvCNiaa	I found this on a website :<br>  <br>      Kristen Stewart says it would be “so easy” for her not to appear in anymore Twilight films<br>  <br>      The 18-year-old actress - who is due to reprise her role as Bella Swan alongside Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen) in Twilight sequel New Moon - says she’d drop out of the popular movie franchise to send hundreds of teenage girls into a “frenzy”.<br>  <br>      She explains, “I’ve totally had the thought; it would be so easy for me to send so many hundreds of girls into such a frenzy by saying I want no part of any future [Twilight] movies.<br>  <br>      “It took a long time for me to admit that I was too bogged down by the first book, to admit to these girls that I wasn’t as… I’m just as obsessed as they are; I read it from an entirely different perspective and had to live it for three months.<br>  <br>      “Yeah, I have thought, many times. “What could I do?” It’d be so easy.”<br>  <br>  SOURCE<br>  <br>  Thanks to IamSwitzerland.<br>  <br>  For those debating on the actual intent of Kristen’s meaning, here is the actual source, with Kristen’s comments in it’s original context.<br>  <br>  An excerpt is as follows:<br>  <br>      At the end of a long day of interviews promoting Twilight, it might be exhaustion — or high spirits — that makes Kristen Stewart so blunt; asked if she’s thought about walking away from the series just to mess with people’s heads, she laughs: ” Oh, God, yeah. I’ve totally had the thought; it would be so easy for me to send so many hundreds of girls into such a frenzy. It took a long time for me to admit that I was too bogged down by the first book, to admit to these girls that I wasn’t as … I’m just as obsessed as they are; I read it from an entirely different perspective and had to live it for three months. I can’t start the next book unless I have the job to do, or I’m just gonna drive myself insane — and even this, they don’t get that. They’re like “What? How could you not read the book …?” Yeah, I have thought, many times. “What could I do?” It’d be so easy. …”<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :D|`|Nx1BaFPKaa	people are saying its rude of her to not show up at the oscars, because she was supposed to be there, even though she wasnt introducing anything. and she says a lot that it would just be so easy for her to quit, and that she doesnt even like twilight, and she thinks it would be amazing to see all the fans go into a frenzy over it. and that she didnt like the book, and didnt even read it until after she got the part. i dont think she diserved the part, though i did like the movie, and think she is a good actress.|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Aw poor kristen stewart - it must be hard being a really famous star with a movie role a million girls would die for. Typical spoiled brat; and to be honest she killed Bella Swan's part for me - she a boring, lifeless, one-dimensional, facially expressionless actress and i think she sucks!|`|4SyLyB6Eaa	i think she played a boring, lifeless bella<br>   but yeah she said that she woukd drop out of twilight<br>  because of all the fans|`|pEDavW3caa	well she said something that she could drop out just to make the fans go crazy. she said she wouldn't go unless she did a great movie not just ones that make a lot of money. about not going to the oscars.

Ewan McGregor has sung in a bunch of movies and I think he sings outside of movies as well.|`|UnqAjpVOaa	No no, they sing, otherwise they might as well get the people who are actually singing to act in the movie instead of them; And also Kidman does sing (not well) but she did that duet with Robbie Williams.|`|Tj56EVaDaa	They actually sing.|`|yjwKCMcGaa	They actually sing.|`|MQx6fz8aaa	nope i was ewan's voice double it was actually me who you heard singing.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Yes they actually sing.

Apparently some people have heard or read it was her while others have heard or read it was not. "
rv2FJlIiaa	You love Ouran High School host Club, Special A and Skip Beat! ? <br>  I loved it to!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You like romantic comedy right? Well here are some shows you will absolutly love! I am 100% sure of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Lovely Complex<br>  3. Shugo Chara<br>  4. The Wallflower<br>  6. Romeo x Juliet<br>  7. Sauinkoku Monogatari<br>  8. Kare Kano<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I loved every single of those shows. I know you will like them alot too!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Lovely Complx<br>  Lovely Complex is a love story between a boy and a girl. The girl, Risa Koizumi, is 172 cm (5' 8") tall—much taller than the average Japanese girl. The boy, Atsushi Otani, is 156 cm (5'1 and a half") —way below the height of the average Japanese boy. Because of this, they are called the "All Hanshin Kyojin" after a popular comedy duo that has a similar height difference.<br>  <br>  During summer school, a very tall student (from another class) shows up and Risa immediately falls for him, as she has had bad luck with boys in the past because she is tall. There is a girl that Atsushi likes as well, so Risa and Atsushi decide to put aside their differences and help each other get their love interests. But as they get to know each other better, Risa's feelings for Atsushi begin to blossom, and her love life gets complicated from there.<br>  <br>  One notable fact about Lovely Complex is that instead of speaking standard Japanese, almost all characters speak in Kansai-ben (the story takes place in Osaka).[4] While having one or two characters speaking Kansai-ben is common in many anime shows, having all characters doing so is unusual in media produced for a nationwide audience.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovely_comp..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovely_comp...</a><br>  <br>  3. Shuho Chara<br>  <br>  The heroine of the story, Amu Hinamori, is a student at Seiyo Elementary.[1] At first glance, her classmates deem her "cool and spicy" and rumors speculate about her personal life. However, her real personality is that of a very shy girl who has trouble showing her true personality. One night, Amu wishes for the courage to show her "would-be" self, and the next morning finds three brightly colored eggs—red, blue, and green—in her bed. At first, she is alarmed, but realizes she must have really wished to change. These eggs hatch into three Guardian Characters: Ran, Miki, and Su. The Guardian Characters aid Amu in discovering who she truly is and help fulfill Amu's dreams. Amu's life becomes much more complex as she struggles to deal with her "would-be" selves and the Seiyo Elementary's Guardians, who recruit Amu as the Joker to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of peoples' dreams.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to able to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shugo_chara..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shugo_chara...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  4. The wallflower<br>  <br>  The Wallflower is about a girl who was called "ugly" by a boy, the first and only person to whom she confessed her love. This incident sparks a life change, and as a result Sunako shuns all forms of beauty, both in herself as well as in life. Concerned by her change for the worst, Sunako's aunt, the owner of a beautiful mansion where four very handsome students live, offers the guys free rent in her mansion if they can turn Sunako into a "perfect lady" (referred to in Japan as the titular Yamato Nadeshiko).<br>  <br>  While the four of them manage to make Sunako physically beautiful enough to become a lady, the problem lies with her attitude and interests (which Sunako has no intention of changing). Up until the most recent release in the story, they've managed to convince Sunako's aunt that her niece is indeed a lady befitting the mansion in which they live (and prevent the rent from skyrocketing to triple the required amount). However, in reality, Sunako has not changed considerably.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_wallflo..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_wallflo...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  6. Romeo x Juliet<br>  <br>  In the fantastical aeropolis of Neo Verona, the noble house of Capulet had ruled peacefully for generations - until fourteen years ago, when the ancient grudge held by the rival house of Montague led to a mutiny, and the Capulets were deposed and all wiped out in a bloody coup. Now, as Neo Verona suffers under the thrall of its new masters, the fates of two star crossed lovers are about to become tragically entwined... As the citizens of the city suffer, the Capulet clan struggles to strike a blow against their enemies, and the Montagues tighten their grasp on power, an unlikely love blossoms between Romeo and Juliet - but in the face of such adversity, this ill-fated love may be doomed from the outset. Triumph or tragedy; only fate knows what awaits Romeo and Juliet...<br>  <br>  A young girl, Juliet, is the only member of her family to escape the massacre of the Capulet family at the hands of Laertes Montague. Fourteen years later, Lord Montague rules the land of Neo-Verona with an iron-fist as Juliet helps the common folk in a Robin Hoo|`|QUpzCltZaa	Hunter X Hunter:<br>  <a href="http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1306.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1306.html</a>|`|AA11142539	Full Metal Panic (especially the Fumoffu series) is the funniest anime series I've ever watched, but I really liked Ouran Host Club too.

Most of us don't care about their elaborate stages, their movies and television shows, their books with "rare" photos. Most of just care about the music. When all they brought to the table was themselves..and a guitar. When the only thing that they strived for was making music people would give recognition to. It seems like the bigger they get now, the more they try to hide from the world. When really, their imperfections is what got them where they are today.|`|5wUmIuWvaa	Why are people freaking out about this?<br>  WHO GIVES???!!!<br>  They made the movie for there fans.<br>  and all the fans saw it and loved it.<br>  honestly, i dont think the jonas brothers themselves really care if they didnt get #1.<br>  They made the fans happy. which is what they were aiming for.
AA10125474	Let's get something straight right off the bat:<br>  <br>  Steinways may be out of the range of your budget, but they are not overpriced.  Else, they would not be selling any pianos -- but they are still, even in this economic environment.<br>  <br>  Now -- has he been playing piano for only two years?  If not , what was he playing before he had the digital keyboard?  Can a person with such little experience make a judgement between the pianistic merits of a Yamaha ( a mass-produced, cookie cutter piano) and a hand-crafted Steinway??  Forgive me if my assumption is incorrect.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that 98% of U.S. concert venues last year, the artists insisted on Steinway.  I have an 85-year old Steinway that is still going strong.  But nobody will ever say that about a Yamaha.  They really are two different animals<br>  <br>  I understand budget is always an issue, so let's stick with the price range of the Kawai and Yamaha units, arguable the best quality mass production pianos on the market..  If he likes the Kawai, then he should really like the Boston, which is made by Kawai, but according to stringent Steinway design imperatives.  One of those imperatives is "no plastic parts in the action", which, unfortunately, is what you will  find in a Kawai.  There are 25 other design features unique to Steinway-designed instruments. I urge you to include them in you search. Boston makes a very nice 5'10" instrument, and a 6'4".<br>  <br>  Both the Kawai and Boston instruments, IMHO are superior to the Yamaha in touch and tone.<br>  <br>  My experience with the Estonia is that they do not hold up well under heavy use.  I know of a young lady who has a 6 year old Estonia that <br>  already need the hammers and dampers replaced.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  BTW, it is against forum rules to promote your company on the web.  I have seen folks get reported for plugging websites -- I won't do it because I'm not a troll, but many in this forum are.  Just a word to the wise.<br>  <br>  Cheers, <br>  <br>  Glinzek|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Quality rebuilts are a bargain if you find the right rebuilder.<br>  <br>  ... I wouldn't be too specific about brand.

If you are asking for help in selecting a piano, it sounds like your son has some very definite ideas about pianos already.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for someone to buy your son a piano, I would think you would have posted a video of him playing instead of posting something about lobsters.<br>  <br>  Your son may be too picky for the average sponsor. Have you ever heard the expression "Never look a gift horse in the mouth"? I suppose if a Model A Steinway was delivered to your son, he would refuse it because he does not like Steinways.<br>  <br>  In my opinion looking at the pianos you have listed, tells me he does not really know anything about pianos, so any of the ones you have listed will be fine.|`|vAQbqNcfaa	i would buy a Yamaha grand. in fact, i am using a 6ft 11in Yamaha Grand (c6) and i love it. i got (actually my parents bought it) a used one on craiglist from a piano teacher. that piano is 10years old but it's only been played only once a year and it's plays and looks brand new. we also got a very good deal too. it was only like $16,000.

Ow3O7h4caa	If your Sun is within 5 deg of the Ascendant, it is considered to be in the 1st house, not in the 12th which would account why you are not feeling like a recluse.<br>  For one thing, Leo rising automatically makes you an energetic and temperamental person with a set personality. Energy is spent on self interest. In other words, you put the Self first.<br>  <br>  With Sun, ruler of 1st placed in the 12th house, your personal energies would be used behind the scenes as you mentioned. It would make you undertake considerable preparation before a presentation.<br>  With Mars in first, independenceis strong with a straight-forward attitude.  Mars in leo is quite strong and on a physical appearance, often gives a scar or mark on the head or face.<br>  <br>  With the conjunction to Mercury, the mind is quick and impulsive. You are probably very very talkative and somewhat impatient.You want everything does "yesterday" if possible. You would make a good teacher if you can overcome a pre-occupation of the self.<br>  <br>  You probably have Cancer on the cusp of the 12th house. This position alone gives very strong pride. If you had a strong Sun in the 12th house, it would nake you more timid, more compassionate and would work better alone and out of the limelight.<br>  <br>  As for the sextile to the 11th house, you live for the moment and often neglect to plan for the future. You should plan ahead but instead, you aretoo busy worrying about your current interests to take the time. You believe in yourself and live for themement. You have no doubt that you will succeed.<br>  From Jupiter's standpoint, you can accomplish anything you want as long as oyu understand the responsibilities that go along with it. Aim for less and do what has to be done rather than simply talking about it.<br>  <br>  From your mercury's standpoint in the 1st, you try to live each day as full as possible, for you know that your future security and independence depend on it.

No vocals, usually, and it gives the artist and song name so if you hear one you like you can write it down then download it or buy it (your choice).

0HGqGJYTaa	Hi, there. I was in a long term relationship w/a Taurus. I'm a Libra also. What made our relationship work was compromise. We didn't see eye to eye all the time. Yes, he liked to stay in, because he didn't trust people. If he went out, it was only to the movies. Don't get me wrong, being him was extremely comforting and I appreciated his practical side. Very smart guy. He went out with me to make me happy. He travelled more with me, because he knew I would be bored staying home all the time. He liked simple things. Gifts to let him know I was thinking of him. Cards. I also cooked for him on a regular basis, and he was grateful. Basically, they want an honest and loyal and devoted partner. Respect him and never make him doubt that he is your one and only.|`|Vzk8icbIaa	Agree with Brittany

But on the costume, definitley need a trench coat if he looks like the watchmen dude.  look at amazon or a cheep clothing place.  halloween super store has some cool masks on their websites or if you can one of their stores.  Music, listen to theme songs from Psycho, Halloween, the Thing.  Also songs from Batman Begins and the Dark Knight work great.  if you go to youtube and copy the url, then go to mediaconverter.com you can download the songs.  Not the best quality for listening to with headphones, but on a video they sound pretty clear.|`|7YmBMJRuaa	ummm...a fable!!|`|ClZWgDoxaa	"Yo" "word"  "what up" "hey man" "Dude!"

GFndpsBaaa	Well, I don't really like twilight. It is a very female oriented book, so I suspect it will take another such book to 'beat' it. But, in selling terms, it still isn't on the top 10 books sold each day, so It doesn't really have a throne to be knocked off of.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	No idea, but it probably won't be a comic book.

After I read the Twilight series I thought all other books were inferior, so I switched to manga. The manga series that I found really entertaining was Inuyasha. It's a really long series and you can read it at <a href="http://www.onemanga.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com</a> . You could research the series on Wikipedia or something. It's really good, but it takes a while for the romance to begin. I love it!|`|F9rDdfYWaa	Huh. As good as Twilight...<br>  Kinda hard to say, as Twilight wasn't good.<br>  I do know of some good ones though.<br>  Try the Uglies series. Now THOSE are good books.

5TDCswaaaa	Taylor Swift wrote it about what she wants to find someday. Like, that one perfect guy who you end up with despite everything thats against you because you guys love each other that much.<br>  <br>  In the words of taylor swift: "Then there's the love story about how it can all actually work out perfectly and wonderfully. And how love really CAN be everything we dream about. About how someday, we all just might find the one that will kneel to the ground and pull out a ring and say "Marry me, Juliet. You never have to be alone. I love you and that's all I really know."|`|aBUGHgkiaa	Romeo & Juliette.<br>  They fall in love but there parents dont let them get together.<br>  romeo talks to julietes dad asking for her hand. and Juliettes dad says okay then yes. great song. :)|`|VcGJbLpzaa	i dont know but i luv it and it roxs!|`|uXUQOcPwaa	i would guess it's some sort of love story or other

But you're too late!<br>  <br>  Basically, it was him just saying something cool to go with the burst of flames in the room.  "I'm so flattered, but you're too late."

imo6wHjtaa	His role is that of Marcus Belby (a Ravenclaw considered for Slub Club membership since his uncle Damocles created the Wolfsbane Potion but ultimately rejected because of his father's bad standing with Slughorn) in the upcoming Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Filming is done and he had already signed on for the 7th movie but, as you know, he was killed last May.<br>  <br>  Additional info: the character was described as thin and nervous-looking. He tried to answer one of Professor Slughorn's questions too fast and began choking; Slughorn had to cast Anapneo to clear his throat.|`|hvrw02Egaa	He plays Marcus Belby in the Half-Blood Prince.<br>  <br>  I just read he was stabbed.

I heard deathnote was good but haven't gotten around to that yet. you might like elfin lied, although personally i thought it was much to gory. if you go to animeseason.com you can look up anime series by category and genre.

7sXNwFynaa	no|`|lpyWVR2oaa	The fact is, whenever you have negative transits aspecting your chart, there's a high possibility of positive ones making their rounds as well. Usually, there're both the good and bad overlapping so the positive<br>  may very well overshadow the negative. <br>  <br>  So-called negative transits should be best viewed as character strengthening and avoiding them simply deprives one of self-growth.<br>  <br>  Also, since transits involving the Moon are pretty short-lasting, these can just be viewed as temporary hurdles, mostly can be seen as a wake-up call where emotions are concerned.|`|67BjmuWUaa	there's always another side to the aspect.<br>  For instance many people consider Saturn aspects as negative, I have always had good luck with Saturn. Saturn is karmic reward, for good or for ill.<br>  Another thing to consider is that there are 2 sides to every aspect.<br>  If you have a Mars transit for example. It could manifest negatively through violence, car accident, or any number of negative things.<br>  If you want to avoid bad things from happening you have to USE UP THE ENERGY. So in the case of the Mars transit, I would do a vigorous work out to use up the energy in a positive way.

Therefore FALSE!<br>  <br>  A7X stole plenty of their fashion aesthetic from the Goth scene much in the same way that all of Emo raped and pillaged the genre.  However, the music is completely generic everyday crapola that requires zero talent to put forth.  Translation: it's schlock metal.  If you ever want to hear what real Gothic rock is all about, give this link a try.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://gothradio.net/listen.asx" rel="nofollow">http://gothradio.net/listen.asx</a>|`|DbtS5jzEaa	nope they are disgusting rock|`|iEjmCX98aa	nooooooooooooo!<br>  A7X is a mix of traditional Metal and neoclassical Metal.|`|yS61H04haa	Sweetie No...don't listen to your sister.<br>  <br>  <br>  *****<br>  <br>  <br>  If MCR are Gothic rock, then I am a virgin.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Hell no.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	No, not even close.|`|rjfFD2Voaa	Well, I used to take only certain music entertainment industries for their opinion in genres, but now I think it depends on how you view it yourself.<br>  <br>  I think of Gothic rock to be a band that made music for years, they dress kind of dark, maybe some band members had addictions, like My Chemical Romance. I consider them gothic rock.<br>  <br>  I used to think Avenged Sevenfold was metal, slightly heavy metalish, but now I think most bands are edging toward the pop genre, and now they're kind of pop-rockish to me.|`|Exmq1G6Gaa	ive had professionals tell me slipknot is death metal..then i had professionals tell me  they were heavy metal.<br>  <br>  and so the same with avenged sevenfold. there first albums were hardcore.then they started singing soft songs.<br>  <br>  do u think it matters that people put bands in a style category?<br>  <br>  its all just rock. and they can play there guitars well.|`|7Oa6Cxz1aa	Avenged Sevenfold (A7x) is a metalcore band.

33462b45e7f5e8fa0d2c9a98b11323c9aa	I think he sucks.   Jerkson, uh-hmm, i mean jason deserves no one... and neither does stuck-up, fake Molly.|`|YP2xuZdtaa	she way he did it was wrong|`|TqtGoPy3aa	i think what he did was pretty messed up and he should have chosen Molly to begin with, but at the same time he didnt want to keep leading her on. I just think what he did was terribly wrong though!|`|GdcMLaIDaa	I don't like how they make the Bachelor propose to the girl because I think it is to soon to tell if they should get married, they should be allowed more time together.  Although, I do feel bad for Melissa I feel bad for Jason at the same time.  He has had a tough time finding love and he seems like an okay guy.  Also, things may change when the show ends and all relationships do have their share of problems, it is typical for an engagement (engaged too early) to break up, just it is more dramatic on TV.  He had to make a decision fast and it was hard.  I would have asked myself (if I were in his position) who would I have missed more (he was practically bawling, no he was for Molly, would he have done the same for Melissa?).  I feel that the show doesn't always work out and they have to understand that going into it.  I feel that he and Deanna would have been cute, but that would have been harsher.  Jason was in a tough spot, especially with little to no privacy.  Also, Melissa knew before the episode was recorded that they were going to break up, but I agree that he should have tried to fix it. Although, I think he changed to Molly because she is younger and wants to have more fun (just like Deanna and Jesse), they will have a hard time being in public. Oh well, what can you do. (sorry it is a bit long)|`|YJrrZo9jaa	He had to do it on air it was the producers not him.  Chris was on Ellen's show today and said that they had to show the breakup to explain to America what was going on.  Not sure if I buy that, but the bachelor always ends the relationship anyway, so what if he did it after six weeks instead of six months?  He followed his heart and she would have been hurt no matter when he did it.  Why live a lie with Melissa if his heart was with Molly?|`|CQVzUcw7aa	I am so mad about this. He is such a jerk! He's made out to be the sweet innocent single dad, who got his heart broken two times. Well I say to him suck it up that's life, nothing ever seems fair for anyone. Sure it sucks to get your heart broken but he's not the only one, everybody gets their heart broken. They should have deserving people on the show like Stephanie who actually deserve a second chance. She got her heart broken but in a different way because her husband died, that's totally different. <br>  <br>  As for what he did to Melissa, that makes him an a**hole. On after the final rose, I knew it was going to be dramatic but I never expected this!<br>  <br>  If he were such a sweet guy and perfect husband, he would not have done that to Melissa.|`|wJHlMJcCaa	He is such a JERK!!! Im so mad at him! Melissa would be a much better mother then Molly!!! He should have picked Molly the first time!! It made Melissa fell awfull!!!!!!!! He has had his heart broken before he knows what it feels like why did he do it to her then??? God i hate him!! Oh yeah he even said this in his OWN words!!! "Melissa is a great person, she's very sweet and will always be there for you. But Molly is fun and outgoing."! So you need someone fun but not someone that will actually take care of your child, not someone who will actually stay with you, not someone who will actually be there for you when you old!!!!<br>  <br>   He's a JERK!!!!|`|UNbdXGHIaa	maybe later the other girls the one he wants to marry now ,betray him lol

ISbtuWdTaa	Err, no.  Which is why it's rated 18A.|`|WOM8ZavGaa	that really sucks!<br>  <br>  In my area (NY), Watchmen is rated R - which means you have to be 16 or older without an adult. And once you have one 16 year old, you can bring people that are under 16!
7nHuDxivaa	her voice is mediocre  she sounds good on her CDs cause its all super produced<br>  <br>  Christina actually has a real voice|`|E5Ya66Ibaa	she used to sound like christina aguilera now she sounds like a porn star she sucks!|`|DyBzMurgaa	okay she's like a good singer in a bad position. People need to give her a break.|`|3FnhJluuaa	are you effin serious. Everyone criticizes her. Do you know how much pain she goes through. Do you like to see people un-happy. She had an awesome voice but it is gone but saying that she should get more exposed is just pathetic.Your such an awful person. She still has a good voice but her record company does not let her because of the criticism she would get for singing live because of her breathing. No one can do such hardcore dancing and still sing at the same time.<br>  <br>  Give her a break. I swear you people are so cruel to her|`|l8djUFdDaa	"how come she doesn't get exposed or criticized like Milli Vanilli were?"<br>  <br>  Because unlike Britney it was completely different persons singing for Milli Vanillis vocals...Britney on the other hand HAD a very impressive vocal range for someone in her voice type (Think Justin Timberlake but with ALOT more range) She was kinda like Christina on her first album.but of course breathy-sex vocals sell which is why the alter her voice, and after her meltdown in 2007 with all that drinking and partying, who knows what her voice sounds like....And theres only so much a studio machines can do for a voice;-) Like Paris for example her voice sucks and she sounds nothing like the CD live..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYoUi0Cyd88" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYoUi0Cyd...</a><br>  <br>  ^Thats Britney at 10yrs old in that video..I think its pretty impressive..

sDhcMlLiaa	Batman is way lot better and cooler as with the bat-flash-lights on the sky in old animations and batman-movies !|`|8FdpVZBmaa	Iron Man, because he has these weapons that could blow up the moon, and he has super strength. Batman is cool too, but I just think Iron Man is better. I hope I helped.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Stronger - Iron Man<br>  <br>  I like Batman more :]|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	Batman's a better character, he has a reason for what he does that many people can relate to. He trained for about seven years abroad to become the vigilante hero he is today. He's a detective, he solves things most heroes wouldn't and couldn't.<br>  <br>  Iron Man is cool, probably my least favorite a-lister on the Marvel roster which I prefer over DC's. I can't tell you too much about him other than his father died when he was a teen, he was an asinine  rich kid banging super model chicks and Hollywood actreeses for most of his life (that would be a great life) and he manufactures weapons of war still, he never stopped like he did in the movie.|`|PLk1aEvvaa	Iron Man- strong only in suit, weak outside of it<br>                in suit he'll kick batman's ***, outside Batman will Murder him<br>  <br>  <br>  Batman-  Strong in and out of suit<br>                cant kick iron man's *** in suit, outside he'll will Murder him|`|4ZxdJMV1aa	Batman because hes much smarter <br>  <br>  And intelligence beats strength i guess
wNJetCLEaa	Well first of all there is wirepop, which is a website for semi-professional comic book artists.  You could probably post there if you are good enough.  Secondly there is enter void (just type that into google and pick the first website)  this is a website that allows for artists to pit there characters against other artists in battles (which they draw) and are then voted on.  There is always deviant art which is probably the most popular contemporary art website there is.  This will allow for you to get tons of feed back.<br>  good luck

u4liwDhAaa	Good question.  Don't feel alone.  It baffles me too.  I'm to the point that I enjoy British TV better than American.  I love British sitcoms.  They are great.<br>  <br>  I never realized that Wife Swap and Kitchen Nightmares were suppose to be documentaries.  I know I don't like those two shows because of the way people are treated.

Afterwards it was shown on the Disney Channel to advertise the Timon and Pumbaa TV show.  The only time it was released on home video that I could find is the VHS version of "The Best of Roger Rabbit" during the trailers and previews advertising the TV show.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	It could have been from the cartoon show.<br>  <br>  Or Lion King 1 1/2<br>  Or Lion King 2<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't remember them singing it. :/|`|4PmfE1Rjaa	Hrm, it could've been LK1/LK2 but maybe also LK3 as that one is (if I remember correctly) specifically about Timon and Pumbaa :D<br>  So try watching the 3rd one maybe. :]|`|9vCI33O0aa	i don't think this was in any of the movies. i think it was in the series that was on Toon Disney.|`|7wVsKuQraa	lion king 1/2|`|knKVjOE6aa	It's from the TV series that was done it's pretty funny.|`|syvhrYi5aa	I remember seeing this a lot when I was little.

Or attack their friends/family.

They sang 7 songs at my concert<br>  <br>  I would get there around  6:00 or 6:30 like i did. Time enough to park,  get souvenirs, find your seats, and make a possible restroom stop. Once its started, you don't want to get up from your seats its that awesome!|`|3FnhJluuaa	yes you should get there early as possible there will be a huuge crown.

7WoDoHmKaa	I myself am making a horror film my advice is edit with a good and easy to use editing studio (such as Sony Vegas or Pinnacle Studio) get some friends and some basic lighting and props and look on youtube for filmmaking shows (Such as indymogul or ParkersTutorials) Also could you possily email me the link to your trailer I'd love to see it|`|zmQQEueyaa	I use adobe premiere to make them, it costs alot but there might be less expensive programs.  You will also need the right music.  Unless you are going to compose your own, I would sugest listening to movie themes especially Batan Begins, The Dark Knight, Halloween, the Fog, etc..  I haven't used any blood though because I am still making movies for my class and they won't let me use blood.  You might want to do some scenes at night.

dPgP28Aiaa	I agree with you all the way sugar. And I'll fight with you against the anti marijuana people. They're just uneducated about mother earth's best gift to the world. It's considered a "drug" to most people. To me it's an herb. An unharmful, safe to smoke herb. :)|`|kg6H6HDuaa	Someone over-dosing on weed no but I have heard of people who start by smoking weed and end up doing stronger substances and end up killing family members (you know babies and wives), but pot-heads like yourself wouldn't understand unless you have gone through that.  It is a gateway DRUG!<br>  <br>  The key word in your second supposed arguement is LEGAL<br>  <br>  Um Jesus made wine and I don't think Gods intention was for low lives to get high off of a plant so I will disregard your last arguement|`|tT6GMdHiaa	what noone tells you is.......weed can make you crazy... seriously that why i don't like to smoke that much because i start tweakin (acting crazy)<br>  dopamine over dose!|`|nAK82h6vaa	I'm not against weed.Just makes me sleepy when i smoke it.And i do think alchol is worse|`|PEWKoIOvaa	fear. also, did you know that the component of THC that has pain-relieving properties in it is the natural version of the SYNTHETIC pain-killers the pharmaceutical industry employs in the manufacture of synthetic drugs? now, can you imagine how many billions in lost revenues Big Pill would face if people realized all they'd have to do is smoke a joint instead of pop pills like candies all their lives? now can you imagine what and who is partly responsible for the brainwashing propaganda against cannabis use? not only murderers and thieves, but liars, too.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	FEAR<br>  and how being high makes some people feel.I'm not against it or for it I just don't smoke it.I don't need too get high too relax and have fun.<br>  I just have fun period and I like being sober and able too comprehend what is happening around me. <br>  I don't trust man made beer or wine or god grown weed. I trust myself and my LORD and savior Jesus Christ that I can have fun without being high and looking like a FOOL.|`|766d5b80d7a637c2204d9d127fb86200aa	Weed is pure amazing. I'm totally with others when it comes to trying to get it legalized. My brother's been doing research about how there's never been a recorded overdose of weed; again, why isn't the government legalizing this?! I mean come on, it's fun. I've only had it three times but each time I smoked it, I was sent on an hour-long joyride....and a buffet.|`|tqBy3vXvaa	I'm against both. Every cigarrette you smoke takes 2 min off you're life. Every minute counts. God made weed but he probably didn't expect us to use it wrong. Alcohol is also very bad. It controls you're actions. Like car crashes..|`|vKCS3AVLaa	number 1 thank u for the best answer on what comes to mind when i say...<br>  <br>  and number 2. its just a plant, so happeneds if you light it on fire, magical happy things come to you like happy and sleepy and hungry. just like everyday. so what if you feel like your on top of the world, thats why a little dab will do ya. <br>  <br>  LOLLL :]|`|ojEkgJoqaa	well you answered the question about cancer from cigarettes except the rate for pot is 10 times higher<br>  <br>  enough said|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Weed makes you stupid!  There are enough stupid people in the world already!|`|6179b91c60f5f3ed3bb58af9490bc8cbaa	I agree.|`|f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	Weed can cause cancer too. <br>  And whether or not you really think your not impaired your wrong.<br>  Not only that but ppl who smoke long term build up a resistance so they have to smoke more to get the same high. <br>  It's a waste of money and who can afford to waste money in times like these.<br>  It would be different if you only used once in a while but most users are chronic and smoke every day through out the day. Again it's just a waste.<br>  <br>  And if you think I like one better than the other you got me all wrong. I don't smoke or drink any substance anymore that will change my chemical makeup unless it's prescribed by a doctor.<br>  <br>  I guess you just have to grow up sometime.|`|0hdAwwWOaa	weed makes people act lazy and wierd. it also kills your brain cells.so imagine if everyone smoked weed our world would be messed up. everyone would zoned out lazy and retarded. Also different people act in different waysafter smoking weed. So weed gives you a chance to be a retard|`|RIDwzLfaaa	Yeah God made weed for the good. To heal and serve as medicine/treatments. Not the way we use it. However, i don't think weed is bad. Its just bad if you abuse of it.|`|6qljYOO2aa	LOL.<br>  ''Man made beer, god made weed, who do you trust?!''<br>  <br>  I don't have anything against it, yet I don't use it.<br>  As long as my family&&friends aren't effected I seriously couldn't care less.|`|kFnBlYTraa	i honestly think weed should be legal and tabacco should be legal.<br>  because tobacco is worser that weed.|`|AA11969873	It makes you under the influence and it messes with your brain.<br>  <br>  it makes you high<br>  its a drug<br>  gives mood swings<br>  causes you to do dumb things|`|PgDdqky5aa	people are brain washed plain and simple.<br>  <br>  <br>  THC is known to kill cancer and tolerance will go totaly away after two weeks of absences of the drug . vv|`|5ce04c5790938abfd4830d72b71c596faa	Then why do it if it doesnt do anything?<br>  Why waste your time?<br>  It's just stupid.|`|Vd5EoFdKaa	i was just discussing that!<br>  i agree 100%|`|pASzENitaa	where can i find a girl like u i love weed|`|iTk7aaYdaa	read ma mind !<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  its kay, give it another 3 months or so & were on our way ;D !|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I think the fact that alcohol is legal and weed is not is totally arbitrary. They are both psychoactive substances, just with different properties. It's a personal choice whether to ingest any substances, man-made or natural. I personally have no interest in weed, but it doesn't hurt me if someone out there wants to do it.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	I am a nurse and have seen people who have died due to a drug over dose. It is a fact people do die from weed. It lowers your ability to think straight.

That dentist is long gone but, If you could find his Dental chair - you would see my fingerprints in the chair arms.  When drilling - he used a sandblaster, (special training),  when the cavity was almost done, the pain of the air blowing into the bottom of the tooth would bring me up out of the chair.  He would have to have his assistant hold me down.  Pain like you have never known, (and I hope you will never know).<br>  <br>  My gums would bleed and hurt or three days after cleaning,  the procedure was so antiquated back then. <br>  <br>  Yes - I dreaded it too but, things are much different now. Especially the assistant that cleans my teeth.  This gal is so gorgeous,  I could go to the dentist once a month.  Ha!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.  Ask your dentist if he/she has heard of, or seen, teeth repaired with a sandblaster,|`|BMrnl372aa	pull your tounge backwards and close off your throat and breath through your nose if you really worried about that. but the detinst is ver relaxing to me. people are usually afraid cause they may have cavities or need work done that will be painful. but just for a checkup or cleaning, just relax, nothing to worry about and think of those pearly whites when you walk out!|`|b4ed84ea4c76a500f5bae98276bbbf46aa	I find that if the dental hygenist is awesome the visit is MUCH better...make sure you have a good one<br>  also, i think the sounds of the drills are scarier to most people than the actual feel of the needles/cleaning stuff<br>  it wouldn't be as bad if we couldnt hear what is going on inside of our head|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	I've always liked the dentist.

For more of a modern alternative rock sound, try 10 years, 12 stones, or Saving Abel.

OXSOch9Oaa	There's not a category for best Romance film.  They were simply highlighting the romance films that came out over the year.  The only 'best' movie anything, is best picture, which went to Slumdog Millionaire.|`|i4UeicOmaa	They weren't presenting an Oscar for that category... they were just showing a compilation of romance scenes from some of 2009s best flicks.|`|EZf00NJJaa	Slumdog Millionaire .<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oscar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oscar.com/</a>|`|PzHgW0rUaa	there wasnt that catagory but if there was it would have been twilight no competition|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	You must be confusing the Oscars with the Teen Choice Awards - which is understandable since they are both a joke!  But to answer your question, since Slumdog Millionaire won Best Picture and it happens to be a romance, you would have to say it was the best romance movie.  It's only logical right?|`|g2QUNwZzaa	there is no "romance film of the year" award at the oscars. what were u watching?

KuWLNfYbaa	Yes! i had a fight with a gypsy who was brandishing a pick,he brought the pick down on my groin and i knocked him out.As i was walking home his friends drove their car at me and i literaly had to run for my life after i put a brick through their front windscreen.If i had fallen or not reached the local fields i would have been killed.Somebody called the police who visited the camp and a shotgun was fired at the police.The offender tried to leave the country but there was an APB put out for him and he was arrested a few days later in Dover.The incident happened in Wales.He was sent to prison for many years|`|XjcrMNBuaa	yes...<br>  i was almost raped once when i was 15..i got into a car with a stranger and he started to attack me<br>  i had to fight back and jump out of a moving car on a deserted dark road<br>  i am very lucky to have escaped<br>  <br>  <br>  this is why we never get in the car with strangers to all u young ladys out there|`|2wpPrmibaa	yes to go to the bathroom|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Never have|`|wmBK9uASaa	ha ha almost,,all I could think was "I`m sure I don`t owe him money and I`m sure he doesnt have a daughter,,,leg it anyway"|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Yes,this mad fooker stabbed me in the hand,he tried to stab me in the stomach but i put my hand in the way and ran like fook,i found out who it was and me and my brothers trashed his house and put him in hospital,that'll teach the w*nker.|`|YfCRmWeSaa	nope|`|pV6K2mm5aa	yes...|`|3SFxfoHEaa	no, it was more of a casual jog.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i already answered this question last week.<br>  <br>  and yes i did, twice.<br>  <br>  once from a dog, and once from thugs with guns|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	only in dreams|`|lkPYYLiKaa	i wish.. it must be such an adrenaline rush lol|`|fawhiGtsaa	No.|`|6a71385d55f4347ddf8136454d3986b0aa	Possibly. I say possibly because I have no idea if the situations I was running from would have turned out to be life threatening. They seemed pretty life threatening at the time.<br>  <br>  I've also ran away from a guy chasing me with a pint glass full of pish. Not life threatening, but still a good enough reason to run.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes. I was in the wrong part of town at the wrong time. I was hanging with friends in a basement apartment. The windows were open and I was sitting closest to the window. I faintly heard a police radio, footsteps, then five pistol shots, which sounded like they were just outside the door. <br>  <br>  I ran for my life and hid in the back closet.<br>  <br>  Later I discovered my "friends" were dealing drugs and I had no idea.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	Possibly. When I was crossing a highway. This was a suburban area and there were only three cars stopped at the traffic light. The walk sign was flashing and I started walking...A car was coming to the intersection. I ran back to the divider/island in the middle of the highway get out of its path. The driver stopped after he went through the intersection and yelled back that he was sorry. The  drivers who were waiting looked at me in surprise. I wish I was able to get his license plate number.|`|I5cF2hXdaa	No my life is never that exciting...|`|AA11656721	When I was young, I needed the restroom really badly, I had to run a distance home from school.  I thought I would just die.

A guy in my first semester history class looked identical to a guy I knew, so I asked the classmate if he was related to him. He freaked out, because apparently he knew the guy too and knew he was gay, so "obivously" I was insulting his manhood in some way. Well, after class, I am walking across the street to the parking lot, and he is driving up the street in his truck, and guns it toward me. Redneck a$$hole. I don't knwo if he would really have run me down, or was just ticked and trying to scare me. Whatever the case, it was very uncool. The guy is gay, not diseased, and even if they had been twin brothers, it wouldn't have any bearing on him at all.|`|wWzK6eJaaa	Yes when I was thirteen me and my cousin (12) went to Mc D's and we were walking back to her house and a car full of hispanic guys, approx like 5 from what I can remember, pulled over and wanted us to come over and prob get in the car. I never ran so fast in my life. By the time we got back to her house my drink was all over me i guess i squeezed it so hard and her french fries where MIA. What a day, we still talk about it now and that was many many yrs ago. lol|`|46fouwFfaa	Yeah. I don't know if I would call it a life or death situation but me and some kids living on the block would taunt one neighbour's violent and big dog. It jumped over its fence and chased us. We all ran in different directions and I don't think any of us got caught or bit.|`|PvlbqhlPaa	no|`|6Gm7TFQ4aa	Three times, all of which were from swarms of bees/hornets. The first time, I got away with only about a dozen stings on my hand from swatting them away as I ran. The guy I was walking with at the time though decided to stand his ground and flail his arms. He ended up in the hospital in terrible condition.|`|3dT7f39maa	Only when the baliff's come knocking|`|8pVN7Ciaaa	Hell ya!!

AROX6og0aa	No.<br>  <br>  But I have started to hate someone I liked before.|`|AORcLwTNaa	yep, they changed|`|AA10922449	No, usually the opposite, when they prove to be a jerkoff.|`|zpwJR60baa	Yes, I had a friend, I hated his character in the beginning.. It is does you judge my their cover.  But as I got to open up and get to know his personality.. we became very good friends. Up to present, we are still good friends, even if we are now 500 miles away.  I can depend on him for advices, and confident answer.   Even if we still have a lot of things not in common in our friends Circe.   I will not replace him as friend, and consider as a brother.|`|jxm3yEHRaa	indeed i totally agree with anwers numero uno,hence my thumb up to her answer<br>  <br>  if i hate someone your ******-no going back...hmmm maybe but they would have to do something amazing like maybe save my life or something similar-but still i would hate em a little...<br>  <br>  thats why i dont have too many people ;)|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	nope.<br>  if i hate someone i pretty much hate them.<br>  I'm a very stong willed person and stubborn.<br>  my oppinion's don't change easily.<br>  so yeah.<br>  it's a good thing i don't hate easily. :D|`|AA10285288	Hate is a very strong word. I use that for only a few "special" people. But, I have grown to like someone I strongly disliked before.|`|ehrzYOPHaa	yes.<br>  this girl isabel.<br>  my friend HATED her SOOOO much, but i really had nothing against her, but since my friend hated her i just went with it.<br>  Now, i like isabel but my friend still gets mad a me for it.<br>  and all i can say is "I am switzerland, I love you both"|`|BO28Mn8haa	yep. my ex and i dated 2 years. prior to that i HATED him. what made us date? a bet from my friends to kiss him.. lol. <br>  <br>  *high school years*|`|IkWcwsj8aa	Lil Wayne..<br>  He went multi-platinum!!<br>  <br>  yes i was a hater...<br>  <br>  and actually i only like lil wayne beacause he is a good entertainer, i still think the majority of his music is sh!t..|`|vOD4Urzdaa	I'll change my opinion, but I usually don't go and totally like them. It's happend before but not very often so far.|`|nDAnSuVBaa	No, if I hate someone there's no going back :)|`|dgGtwSIzaa	Yes ... Bad Idea tho .|`|o80Cdn93aa	It's good not to hate anyone.|`|h4yk6046aa	yes there was this boy and after a while he grew on me we became friends but nothing more, at first i thought we might but we both decided that it wouldn't work if we did so now were just friends,<br>  bella|`|dth2c3cIaa	Happens to me all the time.  I usually wind up getting into a fist fight with em.  After the rumble we got respect for each other then become budds.

7Ct6z23Vaa	FINALLY!!!!! Someone else who notices!! :D<br>  <br>  I mean seriously, the both:<br>  <br>  - have the 'cold' attitude<br>  - have someone they need to pretect: Rukia & Rin<br>  - have long hair, both wear long robes<br>  - they don't say much, but when they do they say things like 'You're not worth my time'<br>  - think they're better than anyone else >:D<br>  - aaaaaaand they're both nobility. Well sort of for Sesshoumaru. =\<br>  <br>  <br>  Yeahhh... =) <br>  <br>  <br>  *cough* and they're both hot *cough* >.<<br>  <br>  ^________________^|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	Yes.I noticed that for a long time but i didn't know that other people noticed it.I'm glad that someone DID noticed it.I thought i was watching too much animes...|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	personally i dont draw any ressemblance between them. except for the fact there both pretty cool!|`|vfywRNbpaa	like a little|`|cZuzIUJraa	Not  really, Sesshomaru is so awesome though.....|`|8LEnEZ87aa	Yes I did. Also his zanpakto is just like gaara's sand as everyone knows.|`|dpAD1KoEaa	yes.. but sesshomaru's face is thiner and longer. I think. but give him black hair and take those makings away and they could be brothers...|`|2DKRF3qoaa	No, not really but they may be spoking by the same guy.|`|fawhiGtsaa	No.|`|UcaxDuLqaa	yeah...they are the tall dark and deadly types...they never have much to say, but when they do you had better listen,...It could mean the difference between life and death ... and I like they way they seem so wise and disciplined...these type of characters are my favorite!! :)
AhoB10CTaa	okay i'm not a guy, but double chins and cute should never be used in the same sentence again|`|FGMDbhoJaa	I'll lick it!! so sexy<br>  hahahahahahhahahaha at your use of 'boulder'|`|7iwVX51saa	Yea. A little boulder is so precious|`|rIDZZZnbaa	Its nice, if a little wieght goes with it, then its Great
msUIsv8maa	Layla was good for the show|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	Leyla, Trevor, and some other doctor. I think that's it. But nobody liked Trevor, and nobody was close enough with Leyla to arrange a funeral, or even attend it. So I don't really see who this funeral that your asking to happen would be for.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I believe there were 4 total...Leila, Trevor, a doctor and a another person....part of the fbi team maybe? I know it kinda bugs how they just completely moved on about the deaths. But then again it is a soap and they never follow real life...lol|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Yeah I know but maybe they just didn't show the funerals because the people who died weren't major characters.|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	I know this is the show's chance to completely update the hospital set, but this was the lamest fire story ever. I felt Leila's death was rushed, especially since it was the first and only time her fiance appeared. I'll miss the character of Trevor, slimeball he was.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Leyla, Trevor, Dr.Andy Archer and Earl Bragg, the man who started this whole thing!|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	Lets just say they killed off the wrong people except for Trevor, he should have been shot a long time go.
fgnQ2vLqaa	I didn't watch GH back when BJ died, but I think the episode would have been better with someone other than KS playing the part. I just kept staring at the red wig, you know?|`|SqNPj54Kaa	I thought it was clever that Maxie played BJ, as Maxie does feel that they are in a way the same person because they share a heart; so that made sense.  I totally enjoyed the whole show; it was a refreshing break and a very sweet closure for Maxie.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	I liked that they used KS to play BJ...I could see the point of that, but the whole story  didn't seem well thought out. I would have loved to see some vets comeback...like Felicia, Frisco, Tony, and Georgie..etc...|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I did think they should have had someone else play BJ, and maybe have Maxie w/an angel or something, as herself, watching everything play out.  I did think it was weird that they had her play BJ too.|`|AA11657825	It was a little strange, seeing her play BJ. But considering she got her heart from BJ and she had just said if BJ had lived instead of her, they just went from there.|`|msUIsv8maa	yes i agree by Maxie playing the role of B.J. it was to phoney.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Yes,it was stupid.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I think they should've used another actor and written a better story line. It sounded like such a good idea- like "It's a Wonderful Life" meets GH. But they way they did it made no sense. Why would those people's lives have changed the way they did because Maxie was dead? Sad- it could've been a great show.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yes they should have got the little girl who played BJ in the first place to play the part again. It would have been wonderful to see her!|`|ADBMrG87aa	The whole episode was stupid.  The writers didn't give much thought into it at all.  It was like the episode was just a timewaster to fill in the gap so alot of the actors could take the day off or something.  There were very important people missing from her dream altogether.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|AA12315431	I think someone esle should have played BJ and as for the dream as a whole, I thought it was lame.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I know they should of found someone to look like B.J.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	I agree, they should have chosen another actor for the part but I guess they saved a few bucks that way. What can I say.
mCgOlHHXaa	yea that's michelle branch- everywhere. Quite easy one.|`|01e7be90a0bc3f8793113187512fc895aa	Everywhere by Michelle Branch|`|qGZgyquEaa	Michelle  Branch- EVERYWHERE

You never pick a best answer to your questions.<br>  Stop acting stupid. You arent doing a paper on anyone. Just ask the question if you want to know.|`|tjqH9iWDaa	pink with green design|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Black; it's all he ever wore.|`|twy8S0L2aa	red
1wNsBNmxaa	She has never done drugs. She said so herself, she never drinks and she does not smoke.<br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I believe she did do some things like cocaine back when she was with Ike.  But I don't think she does any now.  She was born in Nutbush, TN, started her solo career in 1974, and divorced Ike in 1976.|`|e2926326f61b2becbde04426fcb444c8aa	What were her times and challenges.  A not so nice relationship with Ike, in a time when drugs were very common, a lot of time spent in places where drugs are marketed and consumed.  I admire her as a person and as an artist, but she is a human, not an angel.  If she did drugs or not, I know not.  If drugs were near her, YES!|`|iLaot5T5aa	a "ppr"? you need to "kno"??<br>  <br>  Wow. Just wow.<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer you question, I believe it is possible she  has in the past. She probably doesn't anymore though, if she ever did.|`|AA12303060	No. She tried weed one time but she said she hated it.|`|npexSeJSaa	no|`|twy8S0L2aa	possibly,

Surely the blonde lady could distinguish a real tree from a cardboard air freshener. Also it would be clearly visible that the air freshener is in the interior of the car and not outside the windscreen. Thirdly, with the air freshener being in the middle, it would be impossible for her to think she is in collision course with the tree because from her perspective from the drivers seat it would appear to her that she could safely drive past it. Finally, if she was stupid enough to think the air freshener was a real tree, surely she would have crashed the minute she set off on her journey.

If they wont meet you at a public place, like a ticket master to verify they are real, dont do it. You wont get your money back, even with pay pals safe gaurds. No No No!!!

I saw the film and while it was entertaining and MILES better than "The Happening," it wasn't THE BEST horror movie of 2008.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Didn't see it.  The only "horror" movie I saw from 2008 was "Let the Right One In", it was fantastic but not scary.  I'd imagine there wasn't a better one because every horror movie that comes out now is just the same thing over and over (saw 5 - been there done that).  But Mirrors sounds like it's a little different at least, I'll check it out one day.

L39mQJYJaa	Pisces! Cardinals and Fixed don't really like each other so much!<br>  <br>  The Moon, AC, other planets and a whole load of other things could give the Cancerian the best match with Aquarius or something. But if we suppose that the Cancer sign is solely Cancerian and the Pisces is solely Piscean and the Scorpio is solely Scorpion.<br>  Then Cancer and Pisces would be best couple!|`|3VKiFmMJaa	It really depends. I'm a cancer and I have yet to have a relationship with either one. I went on 2 dates w/a scorpio but wasn't physically attracted to him so I changed my number. But in general I find them fascinating, the mysterious/intensity I love it! I can't wait to meet one I AM attracted to!! Pisces would be cool, but to me scorpios are the most intriguing.<br>  <br>  I have a scorpio moon though, so I feel we would connect really well....? Oh yea, and my best friend's boyfriend is a scorpio and they always have problems, I give her advice and it works soooo well!! Makes him all happy. I want to fall in love with a scorpio. My mom is a pisces she is wonderful|`|69PoS4sIaa	pisces are cliingy <br>  scorpios are jealous <br>  either way there are sort of annoying|`|TO5RtlxFaa	Scorpio of course they are the best|`|cdf99d56c45f3f4e746f613838231bc5aa	It depends on the situation...it's really either one. I think the Cancer would have a more peaceful and gentle relationship with a Pisces, but I find that Cancers have a bigger fascination and admiration for Scorpios because they love the intensity and Scorpio's strength- it makes them feel protected and safe. Also, Scorpios tend to be more practical and goal-oriented...which works very well with Cancers big concern for always having enough money. A Cancer might love the fact that Pisces can give them much more sympathy when they get whiny, when a Scorpio might just tell them to shove it and tough it out....but hey, it keeps them on their toes.<br>  <br>  I'm a Scorpio and I've had 2 Cancer men (both in relationships) mention to their friends that if they weren't w/ their current girlfriends, they would definitely be with me. They thought I was really sexy and intriguing (not to be conceited).|`|AA10197672	Cancer and Scorpio is a mach made in heaven! Cancer men are perfect with Scorpio women. The passion these two insanely signs share once in love is incredible! Both are water sign, both are very sensitive and passionate, loving, caring. Both are very loyal and care about family and care about one another. They are a great team together and will be very successful in life. Scorpio makes Cancer feel like home and makes him feel comfotable to come out of his shell. Scorpio provides a great deal in emotional security for Cancer and assures him that he can trust her. She never does anything to bring the jealous side of Cancer and understands Cancers emotional ups and downs and is there to help him through it..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astrology.about.com/od/cancerlove..." rel="nofollow">http://astrology.about.com/od/cancerlove...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starlightastrology.com/can-sc..." rel="nofollow">http://www.starlightastrology.com/can-sc...</a>|`|q5OJURtbaa	I am a Pisces, my love is a Cancer. All of my best friends have always been Cancer's. Everyone though, regardless of our signs, has a personal taste.

He is not good for me, and I knew better going into it, but I just couldn't let him go.|`|QZzQdh43aa	i've never heard of a pisces cancer mix..<br>  but i know scorpios and cancers get along very well. i'm a scorpio and i tend to attract alot of cancer people, and i love them too =P|`|BBSRuyNfaa	Most cancers I know seem to have deeper feelings for scorpios but seem to just get along better with pisces....<br>  <br>  I say cancers are best with virgos! Cuz I'm a virgo and the love of my life is a cancer:-)|`|S0XPrJ2laa	pisces,<br>  it is written

jjmjJ8Mzaa	my top 5 korean dramas are as follows (from most favorite to least favorite):<br>  <br>  1. Sorry, I Love You<br>  - this is my most favorite. the story is very sad and while watching every episode i'm full of tears. the soundtrack is also captivating. i love this drama.<br>  <br>  2. Stairway to Heaven<br>  - this drama is your typical amnesia drama. but with the appealing kwon sang woo and charming choi ji woo, this drama makes a difference from all other dramas. the story is not that unique but it is expressed more meaningful in this drama. the soundtrack keeps me craving for more at the end of each episode. kwon sang woo's natural tears makes me cry in every scene. <br>  <br>  3. Lovers<br>  - this drama brings me excitement at the start of each episode. this drama is full of very romantic moments that makes my heart race. i always get romantic when watching this drama especially because of the chemistry between the two former real-life lovers lee seo jin and kim jung eun. they became real lovers through this drama but they have already separated.<br>  <br>  4. Winter Sonata<br>  - this drama started the amnesia thing in kdramas. it is in winter sonata where the concept of amnesia all began. the story is quite interesting. it's about falling in love with the same person twice at different times. the melody of the songs also captured my heart. who would forget ryu's "my memory" that kept on playing all throughout the drama?<br>  <br>  5. Loveholic<br>  - the main reason why i watched this drama was because i was captivated by the storyline. it is about two lovers separating because the man goes to jail in place of the girl who accidentally killed someone and meet again 5 years later. the story is fantastic. i love it. i also like the meaningful lines that the characters say such as "love is being together.how can you let me go and call that love?" the actors who portrayed were also adorable. i personally adore lee sun gyun who played as an antagonist in the drama.|`|Z91ePgTsaa	In no particular order<br>  1. Stairway to heaven<br>  2. Save the last dance for me<br>  3. Queen of the game<br>  4. Soulmate<br>  5. Time between dog and wolf<br>  <br>  I want to add the Taiwanese drama Silence to the list as it has also got the Korean actress Park Eun Hye in it. <br>  <br>  I don't know how many times I've seen certain scenes from those series, and never get tired.|`|EjyzRAezaa	i love ALL korean dramas...all of them are so addictive & cute,but if i have to choose:<br>  <br>  1-goong(the BEST DRAMA iv ever seen/it's just perfect)<br>  2-snow white<br>  3-i really really like you(eugene and lee min ki are adorable)<br>  4-who are you<br>  5-cant choose b/w boys before flowers or full house,,...both awsome!|`|tcLfAjPpaa	im more on japan drama but i watch korean as well, so here my top 5:<br>  1) Boys Over Flower = i know it not ended yet....but somehow i love it so much<br>  2) My Girl = i like this one because eventhough there is love triangle there, but at the time the realise their love they just go for it & all obstacle come from other people :) very good one<br>  3) Witch Yoo hee = i just love it :)<br>  4) My Lovely Samsoon = for me its kind of different from other k-drama coz its about love between fat woman & her handsome boss. & it quite practical for me as at the end its not 'happily ever after'...<br>  5) Fullhouse
8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	My reasons:<br>  1 - idiot teens babbling with each other all through the movie<br>  2 - price - sure I can afford it but why pay that much just to have the movie ruined by reason #1 when it's perfectly quite at home<br>  3 - I can watch at home and pause whenever I want instead of missing something while going to the bathroom<br>  4 - at home I can get wasted while watching the movie<br>  5 - my big screen TV and nice sound system are decent so I can "experience" the movie almost like in the theater - but it's even better because of all the other reasons I mentioned
YtAkmjoyaa	Whichever side you like, shouldn't really matter.<br>  Though I wear mine on the left side.<br>  And each year you should change, like previous years I had like a whitish stone, then a redish, now I'm wearing cateye(black/greenish).<br>  Also advise you to soak it in salt water for a night or something before you wear so it cleanses.
cUNDGyTSaa	maybe a bit of both but i would say mainly the training|`|bJh1MesQaa	Well sorry but no...|`|0AlqZNC2aa	you have a great great tone! you have great potential! However, you still need more lessons to work on pitch and enunciation. overall, good, but you need more work.|`|lmis1dBjaa	i listened to your piece of music i really cant understand you because you do mumble a bit but withh a bit more practise it should be bettter at the moment i would rate you 3/10|`|Hjsy8rnRaa	Frankly speaking, we can't really tell it here. Mainly because we haven't even heard you sing.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes, you can really sing. You have the potential. However, join some vocal trainings so you could improve and be better.
AA11215640	The blue team lost a challenge, and had to prep both kitchens.  Supposedly Ben "forgot" to make some butter sauce for the girls, and Ramsay asked if it was sabotage.  He then made it for them, (after service started), and it was horrible, so Danny had to make it.   Chef Ramsay thought it was sabotage, and so did I, alittle bit.  I just don't like Ben....|`|S0nyS2bzaa	Ben was to make the butter sauce for the girls team. I think Ben thinks he is better than everyone. I think Gordon Ramsay sent the wrong guy home. Instead of him sending Seth home he should have sent Ben home.|`|MqJ3VgK0aa	Ben was supposed to make butter sauce for the girls but he didnt and Ramsay got mad. I HATE BEN. He should go home!|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I think they were addressing the issue that the guys were doing the prep work for the girls. It gave them a chance to mess with them by doing it poorly.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	The men were supposed to do all the prep for the women and they didn't make one of the sauces.<br>  <br>  I love this show...Gordon Ramsey cracks me up!!
PCsW0gbPaa	Here's what I think.<br>  <br>  Starting at the top left, that's Edward James Olmos, Chris Tucker, I don't know, I don't know, Laurence Fishburne (not Eddie Murphy), and Jason Scott Lee.|`|cuvBHGyraa	The guy in the top middle is not Eddie Murphy. That is Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|`|iraiRVT1aa	top far left corner is Edward James Olmos|`|j6Qa4DbEaa	The guy in the top middle is actually Eddie Murphy, don't know who the rest of them are..sorry.|`|3hYUNHphaa	eddie murphy isn't in this picture! lol.|`|6XHesUihaa	Sorry but I only know Eddie Murphy.
NPl8mciqaa	hi!<br>  the song is called pot kettle black-by tilly and the wall and you can listen to it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7HjBr_QMXI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7HjBr_QM...</a> <br>  <br>  I have been looking for it too-hope that's the right one!
