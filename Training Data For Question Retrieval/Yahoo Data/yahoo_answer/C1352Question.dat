20090203101059AAlwQ78	Social Science;Psychology	Is there a difference between self-esteem and confidence.  And how much of each would you say you have?	I believe there is.        I think I have as healthy amount of self-esteem (meaning i love myself for the attributes i DO have and in spite of my faults) but I don't have as much confidence - meaning  I question how OTHERS view and feel about my attributes.  And I question how others view me generally.      What would you say is the difference between two, and where how do feel you measure up in terms of confidence and esteem?

20090219181041AAvcTFd	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can someone tell me what this dream means?	Ok well first there's background to it. Back when I was in eigth grade, I talked to my friend who I had not seen for at least a couple months. The last time I had hung out with him, things were fine between us. But when I talked to him in eigth grade, he started giving me attitude, and so I asked him if he didn't like me any more or something. He then randomly started cussing me out. Now I am a sophomore in high school and he sits next to me in English class, and lately, I've been thinking about talking to him about what happened in eigth grade even though it was so long ago. In my dream, I was in class with him and he said to me, smiling, "I'm here to help you with the rest of your life." What does this mean?

20090219185744AAnmC62	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What do you think of this dream I had many years ago?	I was setting in a closed class room where we were taught that nothing exists outside of the school. The air was stale the seats hard and the windows were covered with a film that you  could not see out of. We were told that the outside was were death was and if we went outside we would surly die.      I was not paying attention to what the teacher was saying and glanced toward the window and thought I saw some kind of movement.    I ran over to the window and tried to scrub some of the film off. I saw a blurred image of children playing in fields of flowers. I was immediately jerked back to my seat and reminded their was nothing outside of this classroom and nothing worth being taught that was not taught here.    I waited and when the time was right I made a bolt for the door I was caught but managed to get free. As I ran for the door I could hear the other kids crying for my safety. I busted through the doors and it was as I had seen it. I breathed in the fresh air for the first time and saw the beauty of a new and colorful world. I ran to the window and could see in but they could not see out. It was if I had never left all eyes were on the teacher. I waved my hands excitedly and finally one child thought she saw movement.

20090219182732AAfpp0f	Social Science;Psychology	Dream about a dead friend...what does this mean?	Hi :) Last night I had a dream about a friend who died in a car accident a little over a year ago. We only knew eachother for about a year and lost contact about a year or two before he died. He used to want to be with me but I had a bf at the time but I always felt like there was something there...anyway to the dream!!      Last night I dreamt I was down by the river with friends and I looked to my side and he was standing there smiling at me and said "Hey!" and another friend of mine next to him said "Look it's Jason" and I kept saying "It can't be, he's dead" I was in shock and my dead friend said "I know". There are a few blank spots but I remember touching him and it felt so real, gives me shivers thinking about it. I now feel really upset. Then he just disappeared I never fully grieved cos I hadn't seen him for so long I try not to think about it cos I get upset.      I have had a similar dream about him before but only once. Could he be visiting me? Thanks in advance :)
20090219182700AACbICx	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can you interpret this dream?	I am standing with my wife on an immense concrete plain, made of very large individual slabs, like a concrete coordinate plane. It is a warm sunny day with few clouds in a blue sky. Before us in the distance is a futuristic city, its tall buildings seeming to rise at the edge of the concrete. Between us and the city but still some distance from us is a body of water. Like a river but not flowing. Still, like a reflecting pool. It cuts left/right across our view. We are waiting for 2 planes to land.    [Change of perspective] I see the two planes at their level. They are flying at right angles towards each other but there is no feeling they will collide. They are planes but look like large white guppies. They both turn gracefully and glide together side by side.    [Change of perspective] We are on the ground again and watch the planes land on the river/reflecting pool.    [Change of perspective] We are in an elevator in a hotel which had been behind us on the concrete plain. We have to take the elevator to the bottom floor and get out and go meet our daughter, who was on one of the planes which just landed. The elevator has doors on all 4 walls. The doors are ornately finished in chrome. We are on floor 5 and need to go to floor 1. The elevator descends to floor 3, stops, and someone gets on. The elevator then rises instead of taking us down. We exchange puzzled looks and push "1" again. We wonder why the elevator doesn't continue descending until it reaches floor 1.

Black females are considered by many to be the last female to be picked on a team of beautiful females. Most people consider Uma Thurman, Angelina Jolie and others "the most beautiful women in the world..."       What?Whose opinion is that? I'm not knocking their looks, but Angelina stole her lips and body from the black female image. By that count, Toni Braxton, Gabrielle Union, Jennifer Hudson, Jill Marie Jone, Golden Brooks, Tweet, Tameka Raymond, Meagan Good, Kellita Smith, Foxy Brown, Kenya Moore, Kim Porter and Teairra Mari, Genevieve Nnaji are the world's most stunning women. Serena, Amerie, Ashanti, Nia Long and yet they get the least mention of how beautiful they are.

20090219192309AAsjQR1	Social Science;Psychology	How to breach the (metaphorical) shackles (PLEASE HELP!!)...?	...of having been overprotected as a child? And, even today, at the age of 20?      ONLY SERIOUS ANSWERS PLEASE. If you would like to do some reading to ultimately help me out, then thanks. If you are perturbed by the lengthiness of this post, then please don't comment on it; I'm very well aware of how long my post is.      Well I'll try to be succinct in conveying my situation...ultimately, this is a follow up to my question here:  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...       In any event...my dad has always kept a strict vigil over me ever since I was a wee infant, more so than other parents. He is always worried about my "making it" (financially) in life, rather than my being free to discover who I am, what I would enjoy in life, what career path I would be willing to follow, trying new things, etc, etc...you get the drift. I presume that this stems from the fact that he never wanted a child in the first place, and so his guilt for having a child led him down this path.       As soon as he found out that I was "intelligent" in grade 3, he put even more pressure on me to focus on my studies...which is ironic given the fact that I was already very keen on my studies which led to the "discovery" that I had superior intelligence. I stopped enjoying school as a result of this new pressure. I was barely ever allowed to play sports and acquaint and socialize with new friends, because he was afraid of the possible "negative influences" begetting from these activities. He grew up in an age (in the Asian subcontinent) where extra-curriculars didn't factor into your ability to get into college or University, and despite being told that some peripheral activities would help me become a more well-rounded person, he didn't heed to such advice.      Fast forward to today. I honestly will not hold back in telling you that I hate my life. My dad even selected my college major for me, which I hate. All I'm doing nowadays is studying and eating. It's a very monotonous life. I've always been an ambitious person but I feel as if his decisions have and are inhibiting that side of me. He just wants me to get a job where I will go to work from 9-5 and then come home. I would have loved to have tried my best shot at going to medical school to become a surgeon/anesthesiologist but I couldn't because my dad, being an MD himself, thinks that it's too gruesome and horrible for me to handle (but what isn't in life?). I know that I could have made it given that my university GPA is much higher than some of my peers who have made it to medical school. I'm a hard worker and I make the most of the opportunities which have been given to me.      But I just feel as if I'm destined for mediocrity now. Sometimes I tell myself "you're only 20, you know" but then I think that it's too late for me to do anything. Ultimately, I hate myself as a person. Someone replying to that post I linked above stated that children who were overprotected in the past "once they grow up, they will be paranoid, distressed alot of the times about problems in their life. and other issues." I feel that this is the path that I'm heading down. There's so much in life that I want to accomplish, but I feel as if it's too late to start. Any advice on how to regain any shred of self-esteem, confidence, and how to become more positive with the decisions that others make for me? It's hard to find anyone to talk to, given that I'm an only child in my family and that my parents have been separated ever since I was 12. Thanks.

I go to work and pay taxes which fund various gov't programs. As part of my employment, I had to pass a drug test to get my current position and I am subject to random testing which is fine with me.      So since I have to take a drug test to earn the money that the gov't takes, shouldn't the people who receive that money also be subject to the same drug screening?      Isn't that only fair?
20090219194211AAOq3hP	Social Science;Psychology	Ok, i have a question regarding attraction...?	I'm a senior in high school. And over the past few years, i've only had 3 girlfriends. My real question is, why is it that women don't seem attractive to me? I see a girl, and i rarely say to myself, "Wow, she was pretty!" And im not gay! I swear, the very idea makes me sick to my stomach. I just really dont understand why women seem to have virtually no appeal to me. The girls i did date were girls i have known for a while, and i just realized on day, that i really liked her (one at a time. :D) more than i liked the other girls in my life. I'm just kinda puzzled at the moment. Will someone help me figure this out? Maybe another guy that's had the same issue? Does it just sound like im too picky when it comes to women? Leave me an email or something if you have ideas. Or if you just need to ask a question, please help.

20090219203856AAr6mg8	Social Science;Psychology	I had night terrors, any explanation?	From ages 6 or so to age 13 I had horrible night terrors or sleep walking incidents.   My night terrors were worse and freak out my parents. I had no recollection at all the next mornings. I would run into my parents room screaming my head off and by thrashing around crying. My parents would have to hold me down to the bed till I finally relaxed.    These were most common, however only twice did I ever recall the terror because I was completely conscious during it. The first one was that I ran into my parents room convinced that there was a mob of people with fire and pitchforks chasing me up the stairs to the floor where my room was. The second, and surprisingly more terrifying one was when I was still in my room, but I remember cry and pleading for help because I felt as if my covers on my bed were pushing down on me and I couldn't breathe. I was also terrified of everything I saw then, and I had to be at least 12 years old.       I know that my main trigger was when I was stressed out too much the night before.      Has anyone else had night terrors similar to these? Different from them? Any explanation on why they happen at all?

20090219213853AA4UV8F	Social Science;Psychology	Why are people always bored?	I don't understand when people just spit out the words "I'm bored" when they are on the phone, or watching television.      It is so illogical.  I would rather be dead than bored.  If you are bored, life has no meaning.  Don't get me wrong, I have had nothing to do before.  But that was because I was lazy, not because I was bored.        Boredom means that the world has nothing else to offer to you.  We only live here a few years, so don't be bored.

20090219184101AAc6zQr	Social Science;Anthropology	Could Australian Aboriginals have been abducted by aliens?	Professor A. P. Elkin, head of Anthropological Department, University of Sydney wrote in 1945 (long before the alien abduction craze took place), that a common belief amongst the Australian Aboriginal throughout Australia, is that medicine men receive their powers by sky spirits who take the men into the the sky and place a sacred stone crystal through an incision on the back of his skull.      The men are then able to perform telepathy and observe event happening far away. They could disappear and reappear, which has been observed by white men. They could cover great distances in very short amounts of time. In visions they could go to the world of ancestral beings. They could point bones or sing enemies to death from hundreds of kilometers away. This is an observed phenomenon.      Many ancient aboriginal rock painting throughout Australia seem to depict aliens.      Could this be a description of alien intervention?      Source : Elkin A.

20090219181437AATO2VC	Social Science;Psychology	Does the Mass Media cause a psychological myopia?	The advertisements, internet, television programmes and commercial products all uses their own form of titillation to attract consumers. The contemporary era ushered in a surge of consumerism catalyzed by the onslaught of technological advancement. These resulted in people competing blindly with one another over the pursuit of perfection in appearance and ideal lifestyle. It makes people more aware of how others think of their appearnaces. Yet, I corrodes our own value and responsibility as an individual. We failed/grew lazy to see beyond the fancy exterior of others and truely appreciate the people in our lives. Hence, the psychological myopia.      What are your views?

I heard about a study with two women; one plain, one very attractive. Both had a heel snap off and it was observed who received the most help. Apparently the 'sexy one' got at least four times more help from the public.        I notice it in my high school too... if a very shy guy is attractive, it's "ohmigod he is soo sweet". if a very shy guy is unattractive, it's "ew he is so sketchy". My extremely gorgeous friend clearly gets away with a lot and is immediately treated with kindness typically and palpably because she is very beautiful.        What draws a majority of people to like those who are more attractive? Yes, personality wins all, but initially why do so many people do this?

What's the female version for an ideal male?      Don't say that they want a guy with confidence and humor because that deals with life long partners not the initial attraction.      I'm guessing they want large men to protect them but that's just my guess.

Australopithecus afarensis, in my opinion, was certainly adapted for bipedal locomotion (re: pelvis, valgus knee, lack of opposable hallux).  However, hominins as modern as Homo habilis have apelike limb proportions.  Do you think that that this is merely an evolutionary "leftover," or an indication of continued arboreality for at least part of the time (e.g. sleeping in tree nests like chimps)?   Articles citations are great, but not necessary for discussion.

What if Americans all of a sudden stopped buying stuff they didn't need, and crap in general? If everyone became a frugal minimalist and used things until they no longer worked? If people were no longer duped by common marketing techniques? What would happen to our market economy? Would it even function anymore? Would there be enough jobs? What would the big picture look like?      You might say this is occurring at present, but I mean if it happened as a long term paradigm shift rather than as a compulsion.

Economists argue that changes in the money supply have no impact on real variables in the long run, but can in the short run. Why is this the case?        A.    In the short run, monetary policies affect real variables in the economy because the short-run supply curve is upward sloping.           B.    In the long run, any inflation or fluctuations in the economy are eliminated.           C.    In the short run, prices are free to adjust and people are always aware of policy changes.           D.    In the long run, the Bank of Canada often implements policies that negate the effect of its initial policy change.

And lately I've been extra sad because of it so I've been pretending I'm sick so I don't have to do things ex. I've had a "stomach ache" so I didn't go to church ccd and today school. My mom can tell something is up (I usually am pretty good at hiding my depression but lately it has been harder) and she told me she wants me to have a friend sleep over and I said okay and she asked me if I still talked to one of the girl's who hates me now and I said err yeah and she said you're not super depressed are you and I said no(i almost said yes) and she said people aren't making fun of you at school are they? and I said no and she's like you're not over whelmed are you? and I said no.

Crtainly, it seems that women in real life belittle the men closest to them considerably more than they did 30 years ago.      I'm certain women, particularly feminists, don't view this as "empowerment." but it's happening just the same.  The question is, of course, why?      My hypothesis: it's TV portrayals of men, both in programming and the commercials (the REAL "programming")      Is this off the mark?

20090219200035AALZT9a	Social Science;Anthropology	What is the biggest threat to the human race?	I say over population. It is only natural that resources will diminish over time the more people there are.      Less is more. If you have a lake, lets say, and 10 people are drinking from this lake, then it will last a while. It will last longer than 1000 people drinking from it. I believe the human race is selfish, and is only concerned about themselves in their lifetime, not thinking about the future of anyone. Its only natural that we will kill ourselves off the face of the planet in due time. I mean really, do you think humanity will live to see a 1,000 more years?      But this is natures way. It is almost encoded in our DNA to extinct ourselves, vibrating another form and way of life for a future species. Humans may of possibly been the first of their kind on this planet, but there will be something else inhabiting this planet after we are are gone.

20090219202516AAMqVvC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are you familiar with the underground gift economy?	There is a large network of feminists who give (not loan, but give) money to younger women to place them in certain fields.  This is based on our core belief that equal rule is peaceful rule (a belief supported by the fact that in every single instance, in every single part of the world, the more women who are in political power, the more the crime rate and poverty drop.  This is the case here in the USA, too. Our body of scientific and observable groups, proves this beyond any doubt)  Since economic power is necessary to gain political power, feminist actively seek to do just this.  Since the ultimate goal, as clearly stated throughout the body of work, is world peace, this is not sexist.  By empowering women, we are improving the world, and have the facts to prove it.  This is to the benefit of all, and is why we have so many male feminists, as they are sick and tired of the hell wreaked by patriarchy, too. This in stark contrast, to the most powerful group in the world, the Freemasons.  Their all male members take vows to further each others economic and political power.  They have been the kings, all but a couple of US Presidents (and even they were made honorary members) and richest men for hundreds of years.  Feminists are doing the same thing, only without the silly dress up games and secret handshakes.  The feminist version is also not secretive ("underground" is just indicative of so few knowing about it.  If the feminists involved were try to keep secrets, they wouldn't have so much published info about it)        I posted about this last night and (as I said in the post) I knew it would be flagged off.  It has been, so I am posting about it again, knowing that some women who are unfamiliar  with feminism or the ugc  will read it and start researching it.  Last night when I posted that, I offered to send my contacts information from my personal files, without realizing that about ninety million feminists have the info plastered all over the web.  It will be more efficient for any who wish to look into it just googles "underground gift economy".  There's a rich history concerning the philosophies of the 2nd wavers who decided to attempt the experiment in the first place (as usual, everything the Rad Femmes said would happen, has happened.  To an inarguable T) and that alone is worth the google search.      I'll be sure to post this every so often, as I consider the philosophy and practice (I donate what I can) one of the most important experiments carried out in the name of Feminist Theory.  It's a major bridge between here and that far off dream of  equal rule, as well as being very therapeutic after the thousands of years of we women being told that we hate each other.  It's a reaction in no small part to the division of us into madonnas and whores, while at the same time being forced to compete over men.        I'd also be interested in any posters who've had a personal experience with the system.      Commence flagging.
20090219200710AAzOHIu	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How many men still have chest hair?	This kind of question isn't normally my style at all, but someone just asked a shaving question and it made me wonder. I was watching an old James Bond movie with my kids the other night and when Sean Connery appeared in an open shirt with his hairy chest, all 3 of them said Eeeew!      Since the boys take after their father and are naturally smooth-chested, I'd never given it much thought. But what is going on out there to make this become the norm? Are men with hairy chests seriously expected to shave it every day? That's a lot of expanse! (And a lot of stubble!) And what about hairy backs? What are the rules for armpits?       And once I started looking, the majority of men also seem to be sporting hairless legs! (It's summer here.) What is going on??

If keeping up with bills and managing kids at the same time is what you call "hard", then I already know "life".       I know I won't be taken seriously until I'm at least 21.       BUT. Yes, I know FOR SURE that I am gay. I probably know more then YOU do when it comes to history and/or Language Arts. I'm a father, brother, and a mother to my brother. I'm a straight A student, because I know my only chance is getting a scholarship.       What makes you, the adult, so much more important then me?

20090219204542AARQJVC	Social Science;Psychology	Why did I sleep talk when I was "awake"?	I have a history of sleep talking occasionally, but today was different. I got 4 hours of sleep (2am to 6am) and then I was in the car being driven to school. I was really tired but I felt like I was awake..I had my binder on my lap. Then suddenly I mumbled "distract" or "distracting." Then I sort of "woke up" again and I remembered what I had said, but didn't remember having a reason for saying it, you know what I mean? So I said, "Oh, sorry, I must have talked in my sleep..." Lol. Was this because of my lack of sleep? And usually I don't remember forming the words. Sometimes I remember hearing them but don't remember saying them. However this time I remember saying them but not being fully conscious of why.
20090219204252AAMXAvM	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you think about the following quote? What is the solution to lower teen pregnancy rates in the USA?	So they are more in line with European teen pregnancy rates?      "While Americans as a whole don't hold such a dark view of comprehensive sex education, many do feel there's something wrong with a strictly clinical approach. This ambivalence, according to Sarah Brown of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, gets to the root of the problem and may explain the numbers. "One of the things I'm most often asked is why the abortion and unintended pregnancy rates are so much lower in Europe," she says. "People talk about the easy access to contraception there, but I think it's really a matter of the underlying social norms. In Europe, these things are in the open, and the only issue is to be careful. Here in the U.S., people are still arguing about whether it's O.K. to have sex."

20090219205011AA2vdWz	Social Science;Psychology	How do you learn to stand up for yourself and not be a pushover?	everyone knows i'm the pushover. i'm one of the nicest people, with absolutely no backbone. i know that if i figured out why the way i am, i can stop it. but since i cannot figure that out, i'll just try and learn to be more confident and aggressive. my boyfriend said that being a pushover is going to ruin our relationship, because he needs stability, which i completely understand. i need help on how not to be so caring for others, i always put others before me. and it's going to ruin my life if i don't put it to a stop now.

I thought that was only found in Mediterranian countries, because it was brought over from Africa? Where did the Scandinavians get it from?
20090219203506AAOoTxr	Social Science;Psychology	How can i overcome my phobia?	Well, i have trypophobia, which is fear of holes.. especially small holes that are grouped together.whenever i see anything that's like small bubbles or holes together, i get itchy all over and i get goosebumps..   i'm talking about like the condensation bubbles on water bottles, that disgusting picture of the girl and the lotus seed pod blended together, the youtube video of the frog giving birth from it's back, suriname toads, close up pictures of pores, bubbles in boiling water [not as much though], lotus seed pods, lotus seed roots, etc, etc.      it's so disgusting! and i hate having it..   i think i know the root of the problem, it was when i got shingles on my stomach.. i think the blisters that were all over my lower stomach and back triggered it because i started having this fear right after that..   whenever i tell people i have this fear of holes they just laugh and act like i'm joking when i'm really not..       i REALLY want to overcome this fear.    any suggestions on how would be greatlyy appreiciated!!

20090219204458AAp3wg8	Social Science;Psychology	Why is doing the right thing considered good when the "bad" things we do can be much more fulfilling?	See this is a philosophical question why are the right things good?   Come on we all know that it's much more easier to do the bad things. If other people will turn bad on you then why is it right to stay good?   What makes being nice so great that we shouldn't be negative all the time?       You see the Joker played by Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight. He gives this terrifying speech to Harvey Dent about chaos and madness. It's terrifying because deep down we know it's true.    So why not just go mad and have "fun" as the Joker does? Being good does not come with much recognization or attention.      The answer most people would say is "so this doesn't hurt others" but the whole society is selfish and we know it. This answer is way too brief and small. The reasons that people can come up with for being bad is way more than that of being good. Yet! Yet still why is it so right to be nice and good as a person?       I don't know how to award points to the best answer but I would really  appreciate it and will award points if I learn how to do that.      Thanks!
