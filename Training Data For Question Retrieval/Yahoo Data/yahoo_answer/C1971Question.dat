20090222154857AAmFN8p	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	My 80 gb ps3 keeps freezing!!?	i have an 80 gb ps3 that came with the motorstorm bundle back, and i love it other than the fact that it periodically freezes.  the temperature around it is not hot, it used to b but i changed that really fast by removing the back of the stand it was on.  But it freezes on mostly any game, and it seems to be just random, it has frozen on lbp, civilization revolution, cod4, and other games.  Usually it just happens when something is loading, and then it never finishes loading. I cant press the home button or n e thing, so i have to reboot it manually.  Any help? also will a warranty cover it?

Well, my classmates think it's great, but on Xbox Live, it's different. about 2 of every 5 parties I join one of my friend's friends gets on my back either making fun of me, calling me a liar, or accusing me of using a voice-changer, thus we either get into fights, or I get kicked out. I don't think this would be a problem if I literally didn't sound just like James Earl Jones. Please give me any advice, tips, or comments. Thank You. :)
