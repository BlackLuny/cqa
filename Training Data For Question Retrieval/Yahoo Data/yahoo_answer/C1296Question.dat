20090226103313AAFRL7X	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Questions about meiosis/mitosis.. --please tell me if i m understanding it correctly?	Before a cell undergoes mitosis or meiosis it is assumed that the DNA has already replicated, right?      so that, before any cell division begins, each chromosome will have two sister chromatids, joined together (and the sisters wont separate until meiosis II)  (correct?)      Also, alleles come in pairs, so if we consider (for example) chromosome 7, there would be one allele on the paternal chromosome 7 , and one allele on maternal chromosome 7, yes? The maternal and paternal alleles are not identical.       But when dna replicates just one of the chromosomes (eg, maternal) then there will be two Identical alleles on each sister chromatid, right?      so, when the DNA replicates to give the sisters (again, before any cell division) , there will be 2 exact copies of the same allele on the chromosome, one allele on each sister chromatid. Is that right?   So for example,  if we have an allele "A" on maternal chromosome 7,  before any cell division. the chromosome would look like this:         -----------------A-----    (pre dna replication)      but after dna replication it would look like this...      -----------------A-----   -----------------A-----  (these are joined together, and are exactly the same)      is this all correct? thanks.

It deals with inverse trig functions:   g(x) = tan(Sin-1(x))      I have to take the derivative two ways. The first one was simply taking d/dx from this form, which I did. The second method wants me to "rewrite g(x) as a purely algebraic function of x, and, from that new form, find g'(x)."      Am I supposed to incorporate the triangle properties of Sin-1x and then do the same for tanx? Can someone clue me in as to how he wants me to go about this?

20090226112111AAd01gM	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Transformer Question?	Heres the situation. I'm studying two transformer variations. The first one is:      3 1phase 2W   240kV Y/ 24kV Delta      HV=230kV so LV=13.28 kV         the other one is      1 3phase 2W   240kV Y / 24kV delta      HV=230kV LV= 23kV            Now my question is about the LV end of the transformer. The 3 phase transformer has an output of 23kV which I understand because the ratio is obviously 1:10. The 3 1phase transformers I would think would also output 23kV, but for some reason I was told it was divided by the square root of three, which makes no sense to me...If I could get an explanation on this I would appreciate it.

I have become number blind!      Ferris Wheel:      Assume there is a ferris wheel. It has ten carriages, and each carriage can hold two people. Every minute one carriage passes through the place where riders enter and exit the wheel. It takes ten minutes for the wheel to fully rotate.       The man who operates the wheel started it up at 10am, and stopped it again at 10.30am. What is the maximum number of people who could have ridden on the ride during this period?      ... I would like to point out, it is NOT 60. So please don't just multiply 10 by 30. You have to take into account that towards the end of the 30 minutes, people must also get off the wheel, so that when it closes there is noone left on it.

20090225113933AA8qYvw	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	What do you think can make math a more interesting subject for students?	Many students find math to be boring. When I teach math, I always start from the ground up. I don't like to give out a definition or theorem without deriving it, because students think that this is somehow magic. So, when I teach I will actually "tear apart" the theorem and discuss what it really means (many textbooks like to throw out theorems and definitions without discussing them in detail). Then I will back it up with a few examples.      So, my question is what do you think can make math a more interesting subject ? Please be specific and give examples.      I would like to hear from both students and teachers.

20090226151245AA0vqYD	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Is it possible, or even probable, to exist in this universe after death?	I have been pondering this situation. What I imagine is some guy on earth dying. Once he dies he decomposes and all his cells deteriorate, and he becomes dust, and all the atoms that make him up are scattered. You might think you would never see him again. However, I think that if the universe goes on forever, there is a chance he might exist again, either by infinitessimally small chance of his molecules randomly going back to the same places, or maybe a planet exactly like earth(chances of this are also quite small) will form over the course of the infinite lifetime of the universe. Then from this earth after a few billion years, you will be formed again, everyone will be formed again in the exact same way and everything will happen the same way, or maybe just a tad different. There is a chance it will happen, and therefore after infinite time it will happen, and not only will it happen but it will happen infinitely often.   So I guess my question is: do you think this makes sense and why. I am very interested.

In the early years of the Powerball Lottery, a player had to choose five numbers from 1 through 49 and one number from 1 through 42. It can be shown that there are about 8.009x10^7 different ways to do this. Suppose that a group of 200 people decided to purchase tickets for all these numbers and each ticket cost $1.00. how much would each person have expected to pay?      Thanks!!    Its ok if you don't give an answer, a formula will do.

20090226150826AAolUeX	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics help...systems and energy.?	i was reviewing for my exam and this was one of the review questions. They dont give us the answers (dont know why it is pointless studying the wrong stuff) so i was wondering if anyone knew the right answers. each system can have more than one answer and here is the problem word for word      Starting from rest, a woman lifts a barbell with a constant force F through a distance h, at which point she is still lifting, and the barbell has acquired a speed v. Let Ewoman stand for the following energy terms associated with the woman:      Ewoman = Echemical,woman + Kwoman (moving arms etc.) + Ugrav,woman+Earth + Ethermal,woman   The change in the kinetic energy of the barbell is (1/2)mv2 - 0 = (1/2)mv2.   The general statement of the energy principle is Esys = Wext. We'll consider terms on the left side of the equation (the Esys side, changes in the energy inside the system) and terms on the right side (the Wext side, energy inputs from the surroundings).      I. System: Woman + barbell + Earth   For the system consisting of the woman, the barbell, and the Earth, which of the following terms belong on the left side of the energy equation (the Esys side)?      (1/2)mv^2   +mgh   -mgh   Fh   none of these terms (left side is 0)   (1/2)mv2   -Fh   Ewoman                  For the system consisting of the woman, the barbell, and the Earth, which of the following terms belong on the right side of the energy equation (the Wext side)?      2-(1/2)mv2   -mgh   none of these terms (right side is 0)   Fh   Ewoman   +mgh   (1/2)mv2   -Fh               II. System: barbell only   For the system consisting of the barbell only, which of the following terms belong on the left side of the energy equation (the Esys side)?      3-(1/2)mv2   -Fh   +mgh   (1/2)mv2   Ewoman   Fh   none of these terms (left side is 0)   -mgh               For the system consisting of the barbell only, which of the following terms belong on the right side of the energy equation (the Wext side)?      4Fh   none of these terms (right side is 0)   +mgh   Ewoman   -Fh   -mgh   (1/2)mv2   -(1/2)mv2               III. System: barbell + Earth   For the system consisting of the barbell and the Earth, which of the following terms belong on the left side of the energy equation (the Esys side)?      5Ewoman   +mgh   -(1/2)mv2   Fh   -Fh   (1/2)mv2   none of these terms (left side is 0)   -mgh               For the system consisting of the barbell and the Earth, which of the following terms belong on the right side of the energy equation (the Wext side)?      6none of these terms (right side is 0)   Fh   (1/2)mv2   +mgh   Ewoman   -Fh   -mgh   -(1/2)mv2

20090226151410AAKgs1x	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	HEAP applications rejected when using space heaters?	Hello all,          I just returned from the local HEAP heating program office and am pretty upset.  Although my income is well below their limits, my application was rejected because I am using electric space heaters.  This is due to a serious allergy to mercaptan, that irritating chemical that is mixed in with natural gas to make leaks detectable.   I've been using electric heaters for 3 years.  I am very careful with them and they are quite safe.         My house was originally heated with a large, high-quality, Moores gas space heater, which was the only heat source.  The house is an old, two-flat home built in the 1920s and there never was any furnace, after the gravity-feeder died in WWII.  If you can call shoveling coal by hand into a cast-iron stove a furnace setup.  I wouldn't.  After speaking with a HEAP rep and her supervisor, I was told that since my electric bill does not indicate electricity as my primary heat source (it says "other"), and the house originally used a gas space heater, they cannot issue a benefit payment toward my electric bill OR my gas bill.           The electric company wants furnaces that are permanently installed.  In this economy?  You'd think these people would be happy that I am saving energy and have reduced my heating bill by 2/3rds.  I suspect the power company just wants the option of being able to shut off the power to customers without being sued for turning off the heat, too.         So apparently I have no “primary heat source” because there is no furnace.  No furnace, no HEAP money.  And there is no money to install a furnace.         Here in Buffalo we have about 50,000 two-flats from the 1920s, some even earlier.  Most of these houses have never had furnaces installed on the top floor, and rely on large space heaters like my old Moores, plus the heat that rises from the first floor apts.           Many of these flats are occupied by the poorest families, who must often resort to heating one or two rooms with electric space heaters to save on bills, while turning off the expensive gas heat.  If these people give the wrong (truthful) answer to a couple questions at HEAP, they could end up in the cold, with no help for gas or electric heat, and no lights or power for appliances.  Imagine that in a Buffalo, NY winter.

20090225114101AAM61yP	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Why the hurry to make the evolution theory a scientific fact when there is still more to discuss about it?	I'm not a scientist myself and so I neither reject a scientific revelation or accept it until I reach a position in science in which I am able to do that for myself, currently, I go with what the scientists see, but there are still opposing views that should make things undetermined for everyone. I have read evidence that supports the evolution theory, but I have also read evidence that don't and that seemed to be even more convincing to me.       You hear one side mentioning fossils, and then you hear the other side saying that it isn't accurate and bring evidence that refute it. You hear one side mentioning a certain claim, and then you hear the other side mentioning another.       For example this one:       The first thing that must be said is that the claim that    inorganic materials can come together to form life is an    unscientific one that is not verified by any experiment or    observation so far. Life only generates from life. Each    living cell is formed by the replication of another cell.    No one in the world has ever succeeded in forming a living    cell by bringing inorganic materials together, not even in    the most advanced laboratories.

Ok, I have a problem understanding people who protest against animal testing, especially those who terrorise the people running the labs. I am an animal lover myself and don't particularly support animal testing myself, but what else are they going to do? risk humans' lives by testing it on them? or stop trying to develop possibly life saving drugs?   What i'm saying is is that it is immoral to try and stop animal testing all together (especially through violence) and why not just try to get the government to cut down on unnecessary testing? that would probably be a better idea.   I understand that animals need people to stand up for their rights, but violence is not the way.

20090226120326AAxe10j	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Hard riddle/puzzle.......(with answer)?	there are 3 boxes. each box contains 2 balls. the balls are either black or white.      one box contains 2 black balls. one box contains 2 white balls. one box contains a black and a white ball.      the boxes are labled BB, WW, BW.      the lables are removed and replaced so that each box is labled incorrectly.      what is the minimum number of 'peeks' into the box needed to put the lables on the right boxes (only one ball may be seen at a time, thus one 'peek' equals one ball)      ANSWER..... the answer is 1 'peek'. only one ball needs to be known to re-lable the boxes correctly.      i will put the details of HOW this is done in a day or so, so check back!!!!

I'm taking vector calculus and I have this problem that I can't seem to figure out and I need someone to help me understand or point out what I'm missing, please!!!!!!!!!   Here is the problem:      r(3) =       T(3) =     N(3) =      k(3) = 1/3   For t=3  find: the center of the circle of curvature (or osculating circle); the equation of the   oculating plane (the plane determined by T and N); and (most difficult) the equation of the   circle of curvature in parametric form.      When I read the chapter of the book I followed an example they had in 2d. I was able to figure out that the radius of a circle is found by using this formula:      r = 1/k   k is the curvature at a given point, in this case k(3) = 1/3      so the radius of the circle is:   r = 1/(1/3) = 3      Can someone please help me with this problem???
