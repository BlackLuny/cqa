20090131204442AAluArl	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	Switch back to classic view on Yahoo! homepage?	The other evening after deleting browsing history and the like after completing some financial transactions online, when I launched IE in Vista with Yahoo! set as my default homepage again, I actually was directed to m.yahoo.com. At that time though, there was an option to switch back to Classic View. However, I SWEAR that I cannot find it this time around. Also, the whole page is just a mess, period. There are links on top of links; I can’t see the “Web” “Images” etc. headings above the Search box and I of course sent feedback to Yahoo! and in the meantime have set Google as my default homepage, however, if anyone knows how to switch back to Classic View, please do share, as it would be ever so appreciated.    Thanks!

20090226084529AAAJ0wg	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;Other - Yahoo! Messenger	Why would anyone be Invisible 24/7?	Meaning on Yahoo Messenger? For example I'm sure I could do that howver I never leave my computer on if I am not on it and if I am away from it for a little while it just goes Idle and logs me out anyway. My question is it more easier to do that if you have a laptop computer instead of a regular home pc? I know with a laptop it seems alot of people I know don't really them off whereas if they have a home pc they will turn it off. So how can you still be "invisible" or even online if you just leave your computer running all of the time, I would think it would eventually log you off at some point?

I have a quiz coming up and I need to thoroughly understand the following questions. Please Answer in more than one sentence if possible. Your help is appreciated.    1. McCandless thinks his Datsun is a "piece of junk" when he abandons it. In reality, it was fine. What was wrong with it and how did it get that way?    2. In Mexico, McCandless runs into trouble as he is canoeing. Explain his troubles in Mexico.    3. Many people were immediately drawn to Chris and became good friends with him. One such person was Franz, who helped Chris on a number of occasions, including taking him to Grand Junction, Colorado, so that Chris could get to South Dakota. What did Franz do when he got the news that Chris had died in Alaska?    4. Often times we can have strong similarities and strong differences with the same person. This is the case with Chris and his dad. Give two ways they were similar and two ways they were different.    5. Chris was a naturally talented athlete but almost impossible to coach because he always wanted to do it "his way." Give one example of this when he competed in sports.    6. What terrible truth did Chris discover about his father?    7. No doubt there are many vocal critics of McCandless and the decisions he made and the life he lived, yet the author keeps coming to McCandless' defense. Explain one point of criticism and explain how Krakauer comes to McCandless' defense.    8. According to Krakauer, what were the two pivotal mistakes for Chandless that led to his death?

My husband just told me he got a message from Yahoo answers that simply stated his account has been suspended.. but he was not told why.. has this ever happened to anybody else before? What are reasons to suspend someones account and why don't they state the reasons.. this is like guesswork... if one does get accused of something and has not even an idea... That would be like scolding a child without giving the child a reason.. just say.. ''go to your room and you won't get supper'' but no explanation as to why?      So what can be reasons to get suspended and what's this about appealing to Yahoo answers if one does not know what one is supposed to have done??? Some enlightenment would be appreciated.. Thanks..

20090226085815AA71yjo	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	What service does Yahoo! offer to replace the usefulness of Yahoo! Briefcase?	First of all, I know what Yahoo! Briefcase is; I've been using it for years. I have NOT been using it to store email attachments or photos. I have been using it:      a) to move files between two computers (e.g. my work computer and my home computer) when I don't have access to or can't use removable media (e.g. a thumb drive), and      b) to have access to frequently used files (e.g. my resume) from ANY computer, including a public computer or a friend's computer.      Does Yahoo! offer any services that replace these functions?
