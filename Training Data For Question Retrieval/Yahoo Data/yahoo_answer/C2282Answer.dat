yGOmMQP7aa	Have your parents apply for a parent PLUS loan through the school.  The standards for credit are not as strict as for a private student loans.  If they are denied the school will offer you an addtional stafford loan in its place.  If your folks are unable or unwilling to go through this extra step, you are going to have to find a cheaper school.  Not everyone can afford their first choice school, and fin aid doesn't usually give you enough to attend an out of state school.  The details are here:  http://www.fitnyc.edu/aspx/Content.aspx?...    However, i feel it still may not be enough (the amounts are listed on the chart).  And you will just be in the same situation next year, and the year after and the year after.  If the school is making it's students resort to private student loans that they aren't able to get approved for, it's not a very good school and you don't want a degree from there.|`|TEyzimuYaa	Yes.

Accordingly, (3x)+(x)+(2x-12)=180.  On simplification, You'll find that x=32.  So, the three angles are   3*32=96deg,  32deg, and the 3rd one would be   2*32-12=52deg.
CF5y5uywaa	1/6 of the children like math.    2/3 of the children like reading, or 4/6 of the children like reading.    therefore, 1/6 like math, and 4/6 like reading, so add those to know that 5/6 of the children like math and reading.    since you know that, the remaining 1/6 must like science, and since we know that 12 students like science, 1/6 of the students must be 12 students, so to find the total number of students asked, multiple 12 times 6 to find that there are:    72 students asked.    Glad to help! Good question.
eu6UQElYaa	Clearly you don't learn well that way.  My suggestion would be to try different approaches to memorizing the facts.   Write them down when you hear them in the movie and then when you get home go over the list by saying the facts out loud and writing them down again at the same time.  Try having someone else recite the facts with you like a friend or your mom or dad.   You just need to find the best memorization method for your learning style.   You do that through trial and error.|`|FfhGqdgTaa	I am on the same boat as you are on     This is what I do:   Before I watch the movie   I Read a synopsis of the movie on wikipedia   Do some research on the history in which the movie is about|`|6BIEZY6Waa	Perhaps this will work - watch the movie and take notes as you feel necessary.  Then, find a partner - tell him/her about the movie, reciting important information (like what you wrote in your notes).  Then, ask that person to ask you more information on various parts of the movie, essentially having a conversation about the movie.    Recalling and retelling shortly following having watched the movie will help you recall the facts later.

l2BjWA5Baa	Not bad, for English 10. A couple of grammar notes:    First paragraph: Don't capitalize oak. "She" instead of "See" near the end. In that same sentence, don't use but and though in the same clause - very redundant. The last three sentences as a whole, actually, are kind of redundant. I would condense them.    Second paragraph: "tons" is really informal.  Consider "many" or "dozens" or "seemingly thousands." "Were dressed like sad night" makes no sense - what are you trying to say?    Third paragraph: the first half of your first sentence isn't a complete independent clause. I'd change that up a little. Second sentence, if by "caring" you meant "carrying," then that needs to be part of your first sentence and set off by a comma.  "Carried" would also work, or "would be carrying." "would arrive" or "were to arrive" stays in the same tense better than "were arriving." You need a semicolon rather than a comma in "The oven rings; the food is done." "mashED potatoes," not MASH.  You use "down your throat" twice in two sentences - I'd try to change that. QuickLY is an adverb; quick is not - she pats her hair quickLY or she gives her hair a quick pat, but you cannot say she pats her hair quick.  Grasping is not a word that makes sense to use with smells, at least not in prose.  Finally, empowered BY, not empowered with.    Fourth paragraph: emotionAL, not emotion.  And frankly, if the woman is very emotional, it doesn't make sense for her to stop crying.  Try a different adjective.      Style notes:    All your sentences seem to be the same length. In places where you're making lists (like all the sentences that start "Her _____ was ____" in the first paragraph), try using commas instead just to keep things interesting. Your sentences get a little choppy.    Is Grandma Jones the great-grandmother? It's hard to tell. Maybe open it, "The day my great-grandmother Jones died..."    Frankly, your description of the food is almost so creative and colourful as to be completely disgusting.  The idea of a chicken drooling up his own juices is revolting, not appealing.    Avoid being wordy by eliminating passive voice - "your taste buds would surrender," not "your tongue would surrender its taste buds..."    It's very creative, though! Overall I like it. Excellent use of many different kinds of descriptions, and nicely done tying the two themes together at the end.|`|dtZiXpqNaa	repitition, use it more, makes the reader feel it more.

SuuUtnQ8aa	So I am sorry I don't want to offend you, but it my Sociology 170 class there is this person who sits in front and diagonal from me who is constantly listening to music, tapping his foot, and tapping his pen/pencil. Now it is nice that I cannot hear his music however, everyday day I have that class I am always distracted by the constant tapping and only when I try to my best to tune it out, I am actually able to listen. I understand that u have to make paper cranes, but once something distracts someone, they will always be distracted until your activity ceases, trust me...I am a psych major :D my suggestion would be to sit ALL the way in the back and by no one else, maybe u could suggest that, or just go to your psychological mind and imagine making the cranes, but if you do that, you might miss the lecture, but I don't even understand how you are paying attention while playing with paper.

AA12196812	Dude... You seem to know the answer, don't you?    Less video games and more studying and your grades will improve.    Try, for example, this:    Get yourself a planner or a calendar. And for every extra hour that you studied instead of playing, put a star into the calendar. When you accumulate 10 stars, reward yourself with something - I don't know, get an ice cream or go to movies or something. Remind yourself that you've achieved an important milestone. It will be your very own achievement.     And hey - don't wait for your parents to control you, take control into your own hands.|`|AA12217160	Learning how to study can be a daunting task. My first suggestion is to get a planner and begin to record all your assignments. Then at the end of the day, you will be able to easily see what books and folders you need to take home.    Second, get with your teachers. They may be able to offer you assisntance on assignments.     Third come up with ways to reward yourself as a type of motivation. You know what you like and can use this as a way to help keep you on track.     Fourth, get a study budy. Not just someone who is one of your best friends, but someone you know that makes excellent grades. Chances are they know how to study.     Fifth, Find a place that is quiet and no where near distractions. The less likely you are to be distracted, the more likely you will study.     Sixth, make sure you have supplies you need. The less getting up and walking away from your study area, the less likely you will be distracted.    As you begin your study session, follow the steps below.    First create a list of assignments, tests and projects that you have coming up. Get you assignments for the next day over.     Than decide which test you feel you need to study the most for. Take notes out the book, summarize your notes from class or the text, create flash cards over facts, key terms, etc. Create a game, such as Jeopardy, to help make it more fun.     Then work on projects.    If you have additional time, look the various subjects you are studying and gain more information.     I know many people believe that working on projects and doing assignments are not a form of studying, but like I tell my students, you learn by completing assignments and applying the skills you gained.    Also, if you do not have a note taking method, apply the Cornell method of note taking. It's simply dividing the paper into three different sections. Two are vertical, and the third is horizontal (see link below). On one of the vertical sections, jot down questions. The questions come from rewording heading, sub-headings, key terms, places, and locations into questions, and the questions found in section and chapter reviews. On the second vertical side (should be bigger, to contain more information,) write down the answers to these questions. On the horizontal portion, summarize your notes. This works well for text like English, science, or history.    Another method might be to create a concept map or flow chart. This works well with reading and math.    Finally, if youre taking notes over a novel or short story, try answering the following questions after every chapter or section:     1. Who are the major characters?  2. Who are the minor characters?  3. What is the over tone/ mood of the chapter (section)?  4. What is the plot?  5. What is the setting?  6. Do any of the characters change for the better or worse?  7. How do the minor characters contribute to the major characters?  8. What is the overall theme or meaning behind the chapter (section)?  9. How do I feel about the story after reading this section? Have my feelings change from the beginning of the story? If so, how?    Then summarize about the chapter or section.|`|3blw5udRaa	you should try studying harder.|`|fZjHAxwHaa	Study Study Study!  Ask your teachers for help if you need it, and dont be afraid to ask!  Oh, and I'd talk to a guidance counselor about your parents not caring, maybe your taking it the wrong way, or maybe your counselor can help them help you! And you'll be motivated!       Don't worry kid, you'll make it.|`|idrRW9M7aa	At the end of the day you need to do it for yourself, mate.  Put away the video games and study.

I don't know if motivation i the problem because right now you are showing motivation.   it sounds to me like you are getting bad grades waiting for your parents to react so maybe it's an attention thing.      But sit down and talk to them. Ask them to ground you tell, them I need help doing better. set rules for me and enforce them.      computer is needed for homework.. try just unloading some video games...     if not most computers have a setting where you can have multiple users.  just make it where one account is fun and one account is for studying.    the studying account only have homework prgrams  just after school use the study account it will be less tempting to play games.|`|Hr7vlbkWaa	go to the library and set a time for your parents to get you so you cant leave early and study there.|`|LZarKgScaa	I KNOW THE ANSWER: Hang out with nerds...seriously, I'm a teacher and also I failed all my classes my freshman year, I hung out with the nerdiest of nerds for my last three years and my grades improved dramatically!

lQIKWXDuaa	Its not easy gaining residency in NYC as a student.

You can't just declare residency in  NY to go to college.  They won't let you do that.  In order to get your NY residency you have to live and work in that state without going to school for a period of time (usually a year).    In other words, you have to keep your Florida residency unless you are moving to NY for reasons other than college.
hEFthejvaa	the best way to test if you're fluent is to watch a movie (most preferably a news channel or station) of your 2nd language. people tend to think they're fluent but when they find out how quickly the news reporters talk it gets hard for them.  going abroad insures your fluency & you'll also learn the slang or post-modern language the natives use.  this doesn't mean you're not fluent if you don't study abroad. but if you don't read, watch, or listen to the language regularly then i think you need more practice.

l2BjWA5Baa	What's the question? Is it factoring?    If so, it's not that hard to just do the work. I'll show you the first one.    In factoring, if the second sign is a plus (like 39, 40, 43, 44) then the signs of both factors are the same as the first sign (so both + for 39, both minus for 40).  If the second sign is a minus, then the factors have one of each (so for 41, one - and one +).    Next you want to find factors of the last coefficient than can be combined to give you the second coefficient.  In your first problem there, factors of +99 are 33 and 3, or 11 and 9.  11+9 is 20, so you can factor this equation into (x+9)(x+11).    Let's go through the last one as well.  Factors of -90 are -3 and 30 (or 3 and -30), 5 and -18 (or -5 and 18),  6 and -15 (or -6 and 15) and -9 and 10 (or 9 and -10).  Which ones can we combine to get 9?   -3 + 30 = 27 and -30 + 3 = -27. so nope.  5 + -18 = -13 and -5 + 18 - 13, so nope.  -6 and 15 = 9. yes!  So we can factor this equation (a-6)(a+15).    Factoring is a difficult process to explain; you have to work at it until it "clicks." Learning to think algebraically like this is an extremely valuable skill, however, especially if you plan any further study of math or to ever do anything with computers.    It took me far less time to solve these myself than to even attempt to google a key. Cheating rarely saves time! Learn to do it yourself.|`|BQHxmm9qaa	you could find a torrent of the book, or just suck it up and do the work. you probs wont find it. sorry.

7gpDLc6daa	The point of getting a degree isn't so that you'll earn more money, its that you will have more education in a specific area and become part of the academic elite. You should study what you'll enjoy and worry about your career later. I don't regret my degree choice at all. No degrees are pointless, so study what your heart is in.    I definately agree with this quote from Christina: Money is secondary to happiness.|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	I'd stick with music teacher.  If it's something you love and the major guarantees that you'll do something in that field (for instance, degrees in philosophy and liberal arts are rather pointless) then I say go for it.  Music teacher sounds like a really fun job and there's always going to be demand for teachers.    Though you may not make millions a year being a teacher, the satisfaction you get from the job makes up for it.  And it's not like teachers make minimum wage. Granted they definitely deserve better pay, but it's better pay than a job you'd get with a pointless degree.|`|pRTFjaK4aa	i got a b.s. in elementary education.  i don't regret it at all.  sure it does not earn me a lot money, but i'm very, very satisfied for receiving my degree.|`|ZA6O9qfBaa	I went to Bible College and got a degree in Bible, yet I'm marketing windows.

qjcrMtdhaa	It's just a question of area really.     In order to find area, you have to find the area of the room as a whole and then then a tile as an individual. The are of any object is its width multiplied by it's length.     The area of the room is: 12 x 12, or 144 square feet  The area of one tile is 4 x 8, or 32 square feet    In order to find how many tiles are needed to fill the room, you must divide the area of room by the area of one tile.     144 divided by 32. The answer is 4.5     Since you can't just have half a tile, you would have to round up and say five tiles are needed to fill the room.

Since most of the U of M schools are also public universities, it would also help to know if you are a resident.    That being said, if your GPA of 3.7 is unweighted, then you have a shot at all of the U of M schools listed above.

fAYOMAvGaa	shouldn't you have applied by now??? I think it's a bit too late for you to apply now...    Anyways, Guelph would definitely suit you more... However if you want university that is more well known, go for Waterloo. Mcmaster will definitely be a reach for you.    Extra Curricular doesn't help you too much in Canadian Universities.    I would actually talk to your teachers about ways to improve your mark for example extra tests projects to boast that mark to a 84 if possible... Therefore you can apply for mcmasters.     Personally, I don't think you can make it to U of Waterloo with a below 80% average. Even for Guelph it might be a bit hard... So aim for the 80 to 82 if you can...|`|8qyofB7Zaa	I'd say apply to all 3 - from the cutoff ranges you're more likely to get into Waterloo and Guelph, but the admissions people usually take into account extracurriculars, etc. so you still have a chance. I heard Guelph is better for life sciences than Waterloo, with McMaster being the best (but I'm not in life sciences so I'm not completely sure) but try to visit all 3 campuses to see which one you like best, they're all good schools. Guelph is the closest to Brampton. Good luck with your application.|`|ff6606803b2059c86428dc6439533c71aa	I'd say that you would have a better shot at getting into Guelph, which would be really convenient since its about an hour away from Brampton by bus. Guelph is a great school. I bet you'll enjoy it. I've heard from friends who have gone there that the money on your student card can be used off-campus too.  You can apply to McMaster, but I don't think you have a very good chance. You never know though.  Good luck!
AA10023710	A masters in Education is the qualification for teaching in high school. That's actually what it's for. But what would you teach? Religion? You need to look into the requirements to pass the teaching certification exams in your state, find out if they require a certain number of college credits in the field you plan to teach, and make getting those credits part of your plan.     You do still have to pass Praxis and get certified, yes.     A masters in Ed qualifies you to teach K-12, but not teach college. To teach college, you need a terminal degree in the field you plan to teach - usually a PhD.     A masters in coaching ed - intriguing. If your plan is to become a full time coach at a HS or a college, that might work. It's worth investigating.|`|UxooffHZaa	You should transfer to a Master's in Education program, like this one. http://www.lorainccc.edu/UP/Bachelor+and...  Otherwise, some schools also offer 1 year post-bac, teaching certification programs. These aren't a full Master's but either way, you want to complete one of these programs to get the requirements for Ohio teaching certification.

Foreign language should be a Latin-based language (such as Latin, French, or Spanish) to help with medical terminology.  Paramedics also need to be good at algebra, have a creative mind, excellent communication and leadership skills, and have good critical thinking skills, besides having a good sense of humour.  Take some fun electives and participate an extracurriculars that might help you develop some of these skills (theatre, debate, art, and student organizations such as FCA, FFA, FNA, FTA, etc. are some good examples).|`|26ac3d63a2f34ca5401f7ec4b6d5fd7daa	I'm not sure I want to be a paramedic too but not sure what classes to take. All I know is you have to go to uni and do a 3 year full time study and after your first year you can apply for a trainee paramedic and after your 3 years of study you can become a qualified paramedic.    That's in Australia. Not sure if its the same where you live.

aZiYvOfraa	I know how you feel. It felt like one day we were playing with toys and thought boys had cooties and the next girls were wearing bras and talking about periods and boys. It happened so fast, and I hated it. I missed the days when we could all just play a game of tag and not worry about all the drama. The sad thing is that it probably won't get much better until about grade 12 if you're lucky. By then, people start maturing a little, and I found that there was a bit less drama. I know it sucks, but you just have to keep going to school, and ignoring all the immature people who want to start drama. Don't get involved with it, it's not worth it. Just know that one day, most people will mature and things will get better.

dZxjXHA2aa	Simply put antitrust is about healthy competition it keeps a company from being a monopoly.  If a company has too much control of their market, they are often tried in antitrust suits where they have to prove they are not hogging their business market.  In the case of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States, the government saw that over several years Standard Oil Company of NJ had bought up all of its smaller competitors so that they had a monopoly on the petroleum market. Standard Oil lost the case and the government broke Standard Oil up into several, smaller comepetiting firms to keep things fair in the petroleum industry.|`|HkXYGAOdaa	Antitrust laws prohibit a variety of practices that restrain trade.  Examples of illegal practices are price-fixing conspiracies, corporate mergers likely to reduce the competitive vigor of particular markets, and predatory acts designed to achieve or maintain monopoly power.       Standard Oil was an American integrated oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing company. Established in 1870, it operated as a major company trust and was one of the world's first and largest multinational corporations until it was broken up by the United States Supreme Court in 1911. John D. Rockefeller was a founder, chairman and major shareholder, and the company made him a billionaire and eventually the richest man in modern history.    By 1890, Standard Oil controlled 88% of the refined oil flows in the United States. The state of Ohio successfully sued Standard, compelling the dissolution of the trust in 1892. But Standard only separated off Standard Oil of Ohio and kept control of it. Eventually, the state of New Jersey changed its incorporation laws to allow a company to hold shares in other companies in any state. So, in 1899, the Standard Oil Trust, based at 26 Broadway in New York, was legally reborn as a holding company, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (SOCNJ), which held stock in 41 other companies, which controlled other companies, which in turn controlled yet other companies. This conglomerate was seen by the public as all-pervasive, controlled by a select group of directors, and completely unaccountable.    In 1909, the US Department of Justice sued Standard under federal anti-trust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, for sustaining a monopoly and restraining interstate commerce by:    "Rebates, preferences, and other discriminatory practices in favor of the combination by railroad companies; restraint and monopolization by control of pipe lines, and unfair practices against competing pipe lines; contracts with competitors in restraint of trade; unfair methods of competition, such as local price cutting at the points where necessary to suppress competition; [and] espionage of the business of competitors, the operation of bogus independent companies, and payment of rebates on oil, with the like intent."    The lawsuit argued that Standard's monopolistic practices took place in the last four years    The government identified four illegal patterns: 1) secret and semi-secret railroad rates; (2) discriminations in the open arrangement of rates; (3) discriminations in classification and rules of shipment; (4) discriminations in the treatment of private tank cars. The government said that Standard raised prices to its monopolistic customers but lowered them to hurt competitors, often disguising its illegal actions by using bogus supposedly independent companies it controlled.    On May 15, 1911, the US Supreme Court upheld the lower court judgment and declared the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act. It ordered Standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors.    Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Microsoft, ATT are a few of the companies that have been convicted of monopoly, thus, restricting free trade.|`|EECePKs6aa	google it :)|`|03i9D71eaa	United States antitrust law is the body of laws that prohibits anti-competitive behavior (monopoly) and unfair business practices. Antitrust laws are designed to encourage competition in the marketplace. [1] These competition laws make illegal certain practices deemed to hurt businesses or consumers or both, or generally to violate standards of ethical behavior. Government agencies known as competition regulators, along with private litigants, apply the antitrust and consumer protection laws. The term "antitrust" was originally formulated to combat "business trusts", now more commonly known as cartels. Other countries use the term "competition law". Many countries including most of the Western world have antitrust laws of some form; for example the European Union has provisions under the Treaty of Rome to maintain fair competition, as does Australia under its Trade Practices Act 1974.

However, if the service sorority you're considering actually goes through a "rush" process and formally extends bids then there may be as much of a time committment expected there as there would be with the NPC social sorority.    Try my two links; it will give you some better answers!|`|8DrQ9phIaa	As far as I know, Sororities and Frats were all birthed and based on community service. They are going to have social life in them because it's a large group of people joining together for whatever cause. And you cannot join more than one sorority it will never happen. One a Delta (for example) your a Delta only for the rest of your life.|`|3VD8fWF8aa	You'll have to consult both fraternities.

09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	No England was Catholic until Henry VIII established the Church of England making himself the head of the church in order to divorce his first wife Catherine to marry Anne Boleyn.(Henry VIII was a significant figure in the history of the English monarchy. Although in the great part of his reign he brutally suppressed the Protestant reformation of the church,[1] a movement having roots with John Wycliffe of the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with Rome. These struggles ultimately led to his separating the Anglican church from the Roman hierarchy, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and establishing himself as the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Although some claim he became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal backing of the English Reformation was left to his heirs, the devout Edward VI and the renowned Elizabeth I, whilst daughter Mary I temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and Wales (see Laws in Wales Acts 15351542). He is noted for his six marriages.)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_...    War broke out less than forty years after the death of Elizabeth I (Henry VIII daughter by Boleyn) in 1603. At the accession of Charles I in 1625, England and Scotland had both experienced relative peace, both internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a new single kingdom, fulfilling the dream of his father, James I of England (James VI of Scotland). Many English Parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move, because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old English traditions which had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civ...|`|fZDz8yWYaa	Yes, but many English were Catholic in secret or didn't care if they were married to Catholics. And FYI Henry VIII was never married to a woman named MAria. Her name was Catherine of Aragon who was Catholic and England at the time was also Catholic so it was an ok marriage. then catherine got old, henry didn't want  her anymore so he kept  asking the pope to get a divorce. The pope wouldn't allow it because Catherine was part of the spanish monarchy which was a great ally to the church and if the pope granted a divorce then the spanish would attack england and the pope wanted to avoid war at all costs. Eventually henry decided to break off from the church in general. despite the fact that england was seperated from the actual catholic church henry still considered it catholic. he then divorced catherine and married his pregnant mistress, anne boleyn  Henry also despised the protestant following of John Knox and Martin Luther, but two of his children were raised under protestant faith-Elizabeth and Edward. They later reigned separately after his death and because they were protestant, the rest of england had to be protestant also.  So yes, england was protestant at the time and to this day most british people dislike catholics

This helps the student stay interested while you are teaching him how to use the writing process. The biggest trouble with teaching middle school students how to write is that the process is iterative, and many kids this age do not have the attention span to go through their writing and improve it. You make it easier to demonstrate the writing process (i.e. the iterations) by letting the student write about what is already interesting to him.

lqbAA0Ytaa	Personification can be described as a figure of speech in which an inanimate object is personified, by attributing human traits and qualities to it.     My computer hates me.   The camera loves me.   Art is a jealous mistress.   Wind yells while blowing.   Opportunity knocked on the door.   The sun greeted me this morning.   Snow had wrapped a white blanket over the city.   Time never waits for anyone.   Trees were dancing with the wind.   The TV sprang to life.   The radio stopped singing and continued to stare at me.   The picture in that magazine shouted for attention.   Plants were suffering from the intense heat.   The flowers were crying for my attention.   Sun was playing hide and seek, amidst the clouds.   The car winked at me.   The lightning lashed out with anger.   The moon seemed to smile at me from the sky.   The sky was full of dancing stars.|`|AA11988604	Number 3 below is the one you hear most often where the word itself is used.  Number 1 is the most common overall, but the word is not in the sentence itself.      Personification is an ontological metaphor in which a thing or abstraction is represented as a person.[1]    The term "personification" may apply to:       1. A description of an inanimate object as being a living person or animal as in: "The sun shone brightly down on me as if she was shining for me alone". In this example the sun is perceived as a real person, and referenced with the pronoun "she" rather than "it".     2. The act of personifying.     3. A person or thing typifying a certain quality or idea; an embodiment or exemplification: "He's invisible, a walking personification of the Negative" (Ralph Ellison).     4. An artistic representation of an abstract quality or idea as a person, for example the four cardinal virtues or nine Muses.
AA11604732	Rule out Oglethorpe.  It is not a highly regarded school.    The other three are all respectable schools with different pluses and minuses.  Howard is the best of the HSBCs -- and is one of the few that I would not advise someone to avoid.  Most HSBCs lack high academic standards, but provide an interesting learning opportunity.  Howard has both.  The only disadvantage to it is that some employers may not realize it is much better than the other HSBCs.    Georgia has the best academics of the four schools -- but is a big school that may turn some people off.    Mercer isn't as good as Howard or Georgia -- but is a very good regional school.  You will get a great education there.  If you plan on moving to the North, employers won't know the school.  But if you stay in the South, they will respect it.    Personally, I would go for Georgia -- but you should think about what is most important to you.|`|Y55gfxIfaa	Which one interests you more? which one has things that draw your attention towards that particular school?

You must obey your school's deadline not the federal deadline for your state.    The school receives money from the FED and they prepare a financial aid package for all the students that meet their deadline and that are accepted. The student package consist of grants, scholarships, Stafford and Perkin loans. The amount that you will received depend on your expected family contribution which is that EFC number that you will obtained after you submit your fasfa. Since you have no job. Your EFC will be 0. Whatever amount extra that you need you have to get a private student loan which is credit base. Your financial aid award letter will help you decide what to do next. If you submit your FASFA info to the school after that their deadline, they might not have any funds for you.    Apply for FASFA ASAP. Add all the schools that you are applying to on there.

The social skills gained from it, the responsibility, routine, ect of public school and such are wonderful. I don't think that you gain as much from being able to sleep in and just be lazy and only spend a few hours learning as opposed to being in school all day with actual teachers.   Some people love it, though, so whatever floats your boat!|`|BHGAAAJVaa	Well it's really up too you.  Basically if you would like to even do two grades in one year to get ahead a little then sure homeschooling is great.  Also if you find that school is easy then homeschooling  could be an option.  I have a friend that takes about three subjects at a normal high school but everything else is done in homeschooling.    Sometimes you want a little challenge and I think that homeschooling is great.  You still need to do physical activities and have a note signed by a coach etc.  That's how it works where I live.    Your choice.|`|7Oxa6afFaa	I started home schooling this year(my sophomore year), and I love it. I can't stand public school. But yeah, it really is a joy. Expensive though.|`|AA11276208	Wait til the end of the year.  Homeschooling is a great idea but you need to do research about it.  You should sign up for a home school co op because it's more fun that way and you can meet lots of cool home school kids :).
kbRIeIg4aa	I find that teacher who teach honors or AP courses actually teach better than just regular teachers. Advanced courses are challenging but just like anything else you'll get as much out of them as you're willing to put in. If you can take on the responsibility of a heavier homework load and more studying then I say go for it. Colleges look at the rigor of your high school courses. Getting a B in an honors math course is better to them than getting an A in a regular course because it shows that you are willing to challenge yourself. And don't hesitate to take honors math just bc you have to ask questions, I ask questions all the time and any decent teacher will be willing to give you help if they see that you want to learn and care about their class. Good luck!

For example:                       -7 x -6 = 42    When you multiply a negative integer by a positive (or positive by a negative) the product will be negative because both signs are different. For example:                             8 x -5 = -40    When multilpying two positive integers the product is positive, like normal multiplication.    When multiplying a positive and negative integer, just do regular multiplication and add the negative sign to the number.    Good luck ^_^.|`|TjtkZEv3aa	Take the negative sign away, and then put it back in the answer. Multiply the top number with the top number and the bottom number with the bottom number.    TOP x TOP = ANOTHER TOP  BOTTOM x BOTTOM = ANOTHER BOTTOM, so    A x B = C  D x E = F    Substitute those letters with the numbers. Remember, negative x positive = negative, so if one fraction is negative, and one fraction is positive, then the answer will be negative.    If there is an even number of negatives, it is a positive, however.

1khVEE6oaa	300/360    If you need to reduce it, you can clearly see that both numbers are divisible by 10, since they both end in 0, so start by dividing the top and bottom by 10 to get:    30/36     It's pretty easy to see that both of these numbers are divisible to 2 and 3, and thus by 6.  So divide both parts by 6 to get:    ANSWER:  5/6    (If you prefer, you can divide by 2 first and then by 3 or vice versa, but your answer will be the same.)|`|kRlCuvPwaa	300 / 360 and simplify  divide both by 30  10/ 12  divide further by 2  5/ 6  300 is 5/6 of 360|`|vPYcoJ0yaa	divide both by 60, so 300/360 = 5/6.|`|rdgEAOHEaa	300/360=150/180=50/60=10/12=5/6    Ok so:  300/260 divided by 2/2 is 150/180  150/180 divided by 3/3 is 50/60  50/60 divided by 5/5 is 10/12  10/12 divided by 2/2 is 5/6.
SBZEZrxZaa	First, you can factor a five out of the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom).  So, you get:  5(-1c-3)/5(c-6)    The fives on top and bottom cancel out, leaving: -c-3/c-6    There is no way to simplify the fraction any further, so that is your answer to part A!    Next, you are asked for restrictions on the variable, c.  To find these, find the values of c that would give you zero in the denominator of your fraction.  This is because you CANNOT have zero on bottom of a fraction--it's just a rule of math.  How can you find what values of c will give you zero on bottom?  It's pretty simple.    Set the denominator equal to zero, and solve for c:    c-6=0   (now add six to both sides to find c)    c=6     There you have it!  Your answer to part B is that c cannot equal 6.    Good luck on the rest of your problems!|`|dgLCFYaEaa	1/2

jQjhIJzHaa	Completing the Square means you need to use the property  (x+a)^2=x^2+2ax+a^2    In this case  x^2+3x-1=0    Divide the 3 in the middle by 2 to get 3/2 and then square it.  This gives you 9/4.  Now you want to add that to both sides    x^2+3x+9/4-1=9/4    Now the left three terms can be factored into a perfect square    (x+3/2)^2-1=9/4    Move the -1 to the left    (x+3/2)^2=9/4+1 = 13/4    (x+3/2)^2=13/4    Now take the square root    x+3/2=+- sqrt(13/4)  x=3/2+-sqrt(13/4)    Or  x=3/2+sqrt(13/4) OR  x=3/2-sqrt(13/4)|`|69x6iJdyaa	In order to complete the square you take half of the x term, square it and add it to the function so you get:  x^2 + 3x + 1.5^2 - 1 = 1.5^2  x^2 + 3x + 2.25 - 1 = 2.25  (x + 1.5)^2 - 1 = 2.25    You have to realize though that since you are adding something into the equation that you have to do it to both sides.

xoXkHOVsaa	To be a teacher you need a bachelors degree and you need to pass a couple standardized tests.    You can start at community college to get things like introductory english, math, science, ect...  If you went to a four year college, you would do these your freshman year.  These credits should transfer once you apply to a four year college.|`|LRbWZhvnaa	Generally speaking yes.     Here's why:    EVERY TEACHER NEEDS A FOUR-YEAR BACHELOR'S DEGREE, with you teach kindergarten or Grade 12. The subject of the degree determines what you can teach.     However, many four-year bachelor's degrees are now being offered by community colleges.     So, after you complete a degree there, you can enter a one-year teacher education program.

ySpZszp7aa	When you write notes in class, you remember them more easily, even if you never even look at those notes again! The process of actually writing them makes a mental connection, and that's important for taking tests and quizzes. Pay close attention in class, and arrive early to let your teacher know that you're serious about getting your grade up. Ask your teacher if there are any extra-credit assignments that you can take, or if you can retake a test you could have done better on.  Ask your teacher for copies of old materials from previous classes that you can use to practice, and always go over questions you missed to make sure you understand how to solve the problem.|`|j8LymeCoaa	You should try taking notes in class, study, 'pay attention' (I know most of this is boring, but trust me, it works!), and/or talk to your teacher if he/she can help you afterschool understand what you're learning.  I hope this helps!    P.S.  I'm in middle school too and got my grade up. Good luck!|`|7Sxh61UPaa	What you should do is ask your teacher for extra credit. Also, turn in all of your homework from now on. If your teacher takes late work then get in all of your late work. Try to review your notes at night (i know it may be boring but it helps). If you do all of that then you should do great on your next test and get your grade up to a B! :] Good luck!|`|9dr0BZIbaa	A 76% is a pretty average mark, but of course excellence is the key.  My solution is to develop better work habits.  Do your homework every night, so your brain takes in the information for the next test.  Whenever doing assignments, make sure to check your work over multiple times before handing it in.  When studying for a test, do a review, and create questions for yourself.  A bonus would help, but I'm not quite sure if they would offer it.

0LXMgVk5aa	A thermometer will normally contain the liquid mercury.  When the thermometer is placed into the mouth, it will normally be at room temperature, and when it enters it will monitor the body temperature.  As the heat from the individual warms up the thermometer, the mercury molecules will start to expand, due to the increasing heat.  Because of this increase in the size of the molecule, the amount of mercury in the thermometer will increase, which will lead to the tip of the mercury stem (which is where the measurement is read from), expanding up the thermometer, showing a higher temperature.      Anyway I think this is right.  Hope it helps.|`|zCHnMeXbaa	Not sure how simplified you want this, but here goes.  Thermometer (I am assuming it is a glass thermometer) has a measured amount of mercury in a longitudial cavity of glass.  Mercury is made up of matter(atoms & molecules); that matter has significant empty spaces on all sides of the matter.  Remember, atoms and molecules are in constant motion.       The thermometer registers a higher temperature and the mercury rises.  Higher temperature causes matter (atoms & molecules) to speed up their motions which cause an expansion of the empty spaces which cause a rise (elevation) of the mercury to a new stable level.   Real Simple:  increased temperature cause mercury to expand.

f4Nn0W1xaa	This is an interesting question, arabesque. As Blue Coral said, we have an intuitive understanding of these words, just as we do with much of language.    Part of the problem with them is that they are not as straightforward as they first appear. In fact, we use both words in ways that are not always appropriate to their actual definitions.    Nervous technically has nothing to do with one's state of mind. It relates purely to a physical response stemming, reasonably enough, from our nervous system and our musculature. Most of the definitions for it in the OED include the word sinew. That's where the phrase nervous energy comes from. It used to be primarily used to describe physical tics and mannerisms that appeared to result from tension, such as finger tapping, eye twitching, lip biting. Now it is often used to describe the mental state behind those responses.    There are a couple of problems with anxious, as we now use and understand it. First of all, it has more than one definition. The first is "troubled in mind". Other definitions include the words: concerned, solicitous, distressed, and worried. That's simple enough, right? Well, no, because the next common definition is this: Full of desire and endeavour; earnestly desirous. That implies a positive feeling, an eagerness, if you will. So it's a subtle word, one which must be taken in context.    Another problem that I see with the word anxious as it is commonly used in our society is the way it was co-opted by the mental health establishment. It makes sense that they would do so, for several reasons, the first of which being that there are a number of purely physical nervous system disorders and so a distinction is required there for clarity in diagnosis.     Add to that the fact that there is somewhat of a stigma to the word nervous being applied to one's mental state. In Victorian times and, indeed, even much more recently, many serious conditions, particularly in women, were condescendingly passed off as "nerves".    With an increased awareness and understanding of various mental issues that manifest physically and can be quite debilitating for their sufferers a new phrase was coined. Social Anxiety disorders are familiar to us all now, and doesn't anxiety sound much more serious and valid than plain old nervous, even though nervous would be a more accurate way to describe the bodily reactions that are triggered? So our acceptance of the word in this context has removed any positive connotation from most people's minds, and many are quite likely to think that anxiety is, by nature, a bad thing.    I'm sure that was a lot more than you wanted to know about my interpretation of two seemingly simple words, but really it all leads to my main point, which is that with all this confusion running rampant odds are you're using the words in perfectly understandable ways. Unless you have really wandered off on a tangent you probably make as much sense to others as any of us can ever hope for.|`|oPj41KYuaa	nervous insinuates a lack of preparation, or scared of failing    anxious implies that maybe you'll forget something you already know in front of everybody|`|KVkU6WSpaa	The words are very similar in meaning, but 'nervous' is usually used in a negative sense, whereas 'anxious' is usually used in a positive sense.    For instance,     "He was nervous about the upcoming exam, because he knew he was unprepared".    "She was anxious to begin the trip, so she could see her friends."    "Anxious", however, is not always a positive word.  The word "anxiety", which is a form of "anxious" usually has a negative connotation, and is used in almost exactly the same context as "nervous".  In this context, the two words can be used interchangeably.     Hope this helps!|`|pZe7mHTVaa	anxious is synonymous with anxiety, or experiencing anxiety.Nervous is the manifestation in psychosomatic "symptoms" or feelings of nervousness of anxiety.|`|EHrbDq0naa	Anxious implies anticipation. Nervous doesn't.    I can't feel anxious without feeling nervous but I can feel nervous without feeling anxious.  If the kids are getting on my nerves, they're making me feel nervous but they're not making me feel anxious.    Anxious is one of those words that people can argue over.  Yes, it's used similar to eager but for me, the word anxious insinuates a degree of nervousness and even dread.      The statement "I am eager to see him" suggest that I'm excited about it.  But if I said, "I am anxious to see him," there is an implication that I am also nervous about it.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	The distinction can be subtle, but it depends on the meaning used.  "Nervous" generally refers to a simple emotional state, a feeling of uneasiness about something.      When someone is "anxious", it can mean almost the same thing.  "He felt anxious over his upcoming presentation" means basically the same thing as "He felt nervous..."    "Anxious" can also refer to feeling eager and looking forward to something, as in, "He was anxious to begin his first year of college."    It can also refer to a clinical condition often associated with clinical depression, a feeling of anxiety that may not have an actual root cause other than the condition itself.  "He felt anxious all the time" would be an example of this usage.|`|hcqNXUH5aa	Anxiety is something you can lose sleep over.  You're anxious for an exam or a big day...  Too much anxiety can be bad for your body.  It can make you stressed out, loose hair, loose sleep, depressed, or etc.      Being nervous is a different feeling.  It's more of a temporary thing.  I don't think it's as serious.  I can't think of how to explain this... um...  Ex: "I'm nervous for when I have to give my speech."  I think being nervous has to deal with performing or... oh, heck, I don't know!     Arabesque- This is a really good question!  For me, I know the difference, but I have no idea how to explain it... so maybe I don't know the difference?  lol  Sorry, I tried!|`|wEpwWVhJaa	Anxious implies anticipation, nervous hesitance.

j8LymeCoaa	If people who are doing well in math and science in school, Obama emphasizes that they have to get good benefits other than other jobs. He also believes that teachers should be verified so it probes that teachers are able to teach students well. According to many news, the number of teachers are decreasing every year. There is no specific reason, but it will be really scary (or bad) if students don't learn from a great teacher. Since the number of teachers are decreasing, the government realizes that it's a crucial point so they try to hire many teachers, and give them a benefit. The government hopes that many people who has an ability to teach well, they will teach the students well.

If there is one thing that every woman on the face of this  earth can agree on...it is that they never gave it up before marriage and stayed a virgin as long as we could and we reget loosing that self respect and respect from others for the rest of our lives.  Once it's gone....its gone and your value in other people's mind along with it.        C. DISEASES!  DISEASES!  DISEASES!   and condoms break!!!        D.  ITS A SIN.  GOD SAID NO AND THE SPIRITUAL RAMIFICATIONS SHOULD YOU DIE AFTER DEFILING YOUR BODY.

efY2tqNbaa	There were eight cities, built on the same site known as Troy.   Troy 1-5: 3rd Millenium BCE  Troy 6: Destroyed 1300 BCE  Troy 7: 13th Century BCE  Troy 8: last city on the site, built by the Romans in Augustus Caesar's time.  The Trojan war was more mythology, such as in the movie Troy. The ancient Greeks believed it to be real and had taken place in the 13th-12th century BCE in Turkey.   "By modern times both the war and the city were widely believed to be non-historical. In 1870, however, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann excavated a site in this area which he identified as Troy; this claim is now accepted by most scholars.[1][citation needed] Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open question. Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale, though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age. Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War derive from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 11941184 BC, which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa."    Julius Caesar: July 13, 100 BCE - March 15, 44 BCE    Elizabethian refers to the time Queen Elizabeth I was ruling England in the late 1500s to early 1600s CE.

Advice beyond that: Have a strong background in what you think you want to major in and apply early. The earlier you apply the higher chance you may have of getting in. If you want too long to apply spots will be filled. I think I applied for college in my junior year. Check back with UCLA when you head into your junior year as to when you can apply for the semester after your graduation.
fe1d07deddd798cef8cc34a48d842115aa	I work at a college and we pay professors around $6000 per credit per class. It depends on education and experience. PhD's make more than those with Master's - maybe $8000. It also depends on the course. Some are more intensive than others so they would be on the higher level of pay.    Some cases, insturctor's insist on an hourly pay. That ranges from $45 per hour to $80. Again, depending on how many hours the class runs. I live in Connecticut which usually has the highest pay rate of all the states, so you can get a bit of an estimate.|`|lD4r2yD4aa	depends on the school and the degree.

On average, tenure track positions at research universities pay the most.  Part time adjunct positions may pay as little as $2000 per course.

YupMCYHlaa	Nobody's tried this in 22 minutes so I'll have a go.    Well first of all you want to interview the person.  Ask the regular questions--where were you born?  How old are you?  What are your hobbies?  stuff like that.  But also try to find out something interesting about the person, like if he has  black belt in karate or he had had some interesting experience.  There's a skill to interviewing people, the idea is to let the answers to questions suggest other questions.  Anything you learn that's unusual or interesting, you should ask more questions about that.  Like if a person was born far away from here, you could ask how you find this place different from that place.      Then, you introduce the person the way you yourself would like to be introduced, with some of the dull facts--where you were born, how old you are, what grade you're in, what you do in your spare time, but also the unusual things you think people would be interested in--you went to Japan last year, you play the guitar like nobody's business, you can run a six-minute mile, or whatever.  Introduce him as if he was your new friend, and you had just brought him to a party where he doesn't know anyone, and you were telling all your other friends the interesting things about him.    And there's one other thing.  Sometimes in school we get an assignment that we don't know how to do, and the teacher doesn't tell us HOW to do it.  That means that HOW we do it is up to us!  You should see this as an opportunity to put your own mark on the assignment, to make it personally yours.  This is like one of those problems where there is no one right answer, and where you get extra credit for coming up with something, one of many right answers that the teacher didn't expect.

LxM7LhAEaa	When I first started college, I wanted to go to med school.  I majored in Biology, but I really struggled with some of my courses, like Organic Chemistry and Cell Physiology.  In order to get better grades, I just really knuckled down and focused on the course.  I met with the professors during office hours, re-wrote my notes from class, made diagrams, flash cards, things like that.  It took a lot of effort, but my grades improved.

lbQkV9QKaa	well if there is 25 boys and 14 didn't wear a hat then 11 boys did wear a hat. since there is already 14 boys who didn't wear a hat, 20 students who didn't wear a hat - 14 boys = 6 girls who didn't wear a hat. 6 girls no hats + 10 that did wear hats= 16 girls. So there is 16 girls and 25 boys. 16+25= 41. There were 41 students at the game    There was a total of 41 students at the game.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	20 - 14 = 6 girls with no hat    25+10+6 = 41 people at the game|`|AA11357056	20 students (no hat) = 14 boys (no hat) + 6 girls (no hat)  25 boys = 14 boys (no hat) + 11 boys (hat)    GIVEN: 14 boys (no hat) +  FROM EQUATION: 11 boys (hat) +  FROM EQUATION: 6 girls (no hat) +  GIVEN: 10 girls (hat) =    41 students

He helped spread freedom and democracy throughout the world, even though he primarily concentrated on the well-being of the United States. Through all of the tough decisions he had to make, and all of the situations he had to overcome, Dr. King stuck to his morals and ethics.    Martin Luther King Jr. was born January 15, 1929 into a middle class family in Atlanta Georgia. He was the son of a minister and was very intelligent. He entered high school at age 13.    In the 11th grade, he entered an oratorical contest sponsored by the ***** Elks in a distant Georgia town. Martin jr. spoke on "The ***** and the Constitution" and one a prize for his speech. On the way back to Atlanta, he and his teacher reviewed the exciting events of the day. Presently the bus stopped and some whites got on. There were no seats left so the bus driver ordered Martin and his teacher to get up and stand. King refused to budge. The driver threatened him and called him a "black son-of-a-*****," until at last he heeded his teacher's whispers and he got out of his seat. For the rest of the trip home, he and his teacher were jostled around as the bus traveled down the highway. King later said, "It was the angriest I have ever been in my life."    After the 11th grade, King left high school and went to Morehouse college which was accepting exceptional high school juniors to fill its depleted ranks because of the world war. He was only 15 when he enrolled. King graduated in the spring of 1948 at age 19. He elected to then attend the Crozer Seminary in Pennsylvania. After four years at Crozer, he decide to attend the prestigious School of Theology at Boston University. It was here that King would get his PhD., meet his future wife, Corretta Scott, and learn the ways of Ghandi.    Martin read all that he could about Ghandi and he was very impressed by Ghandi's ways and his success. Ghandi believed in peaceful protest and Dr. King also though that this would be effective. After receiving his PhD, many churches expressed interest in having Dr. King become their head minister.    Dr. King became the head minister of a church in montogmery Alabama and achieved national fame for leading the famous bus boycott. Dr. King quickly became a respected national figure. People started to realize that the young Dr. King had something about him, something that made him very special.    After the bus boycott of Montgomery, Dr. King went on to help the African-Americans in our nation. He led protests, gave speeches, and managed to raise a family along the way. Throughout all of this, Dr. King had to make many tough decisions and I would have to say that all of his decisions were the correct decisions. A very clear example of his ethics came in May of 1963. After his the movement for freedom in Birmingham Alabama had been stalled, Dr. King needed ideas to keep the movement going. One of his advisors told him that there were more than a thousand school-age children that wanted, even begged to march. Dr. King was racked in indecision, if he let them march, they could be hurt, or worse, but children marching for freedom could "subpoena the conscience of the nation." The cold truth was that African-American children were maimed every day of their lives, emotionally, every day of their lives while the South stayed segregated. Dr. King decided to let the children march. This decision would save the movement in Birmingham.    On May 2, 1963 more than 1000 excited youngsters, some only 6 years old took the streets of Birmingham by storm. The incensed sheriff, Bull Connor, a radical segragationalist, retorted by arresting more than 900 of the marching children.    The next day, 2,500 youngsters turned out to march for freedom. The children came into town shouting "we want freedom!" When the marchers refused to turn back, Bull Connor shouted "Let 'em have it!". With scores of reporters and TV cameramen recording what happened next, the firemen turned their hoses on the defenseless children. The extreme force of the water ripped their clothing, smashed them into buildings, and knocked them over, eventually pushing their bloodied, helpless bodies into the park. Bull Connor then unleashed dogs, they rushed at the protesters, lunging wildly at fleeing children, three were severely injured as a result of being bitten by the rampid dogs. The protesters ran for their lives while Bull Connor sneered, "Look at those ******* run." One reporter sarcastically summed it up by saying, "God bless America." As it turns out, these actions saved the movement in birmingham.    As you can see, Dr. King made a very tough decision here but it proved to be a good one. Dr. King devoted his life to his people until he was assinated in 1968. His ethics lay in hard work, dedication to a cause, peaceful

Hy0tRECMaa	The best answer is try to go scholarships and grants.    Most scholarships are awarded by merit--your performance and grades in high school as well as future classes at a college.  Some areas of study may have special scholarships awarded on a financial needs basis. Scholarships do not have to be paid back and often covers tuition, books, and dorm fees as well as a little extra for living expenses.      You may also qualify for a grant.  Grants are given based on financial necessity.  Grants are often a smaller amount of money given per semester.  You have minimum criteria (GPA, hours enrolled) to maintain, and have to renew on a yearly basis.  Like scholarships, grants do not have to be paid back.    Last, there's the option of financial aid.  You have criteria you must maintain to qualify.  Once you drop under part-time student status, you have 6 months before you will need to pay it back.     Another idea that you might want to consider if money is an issue--go to a local community college and get your basic courses out of the way.  Classes are a lot cheaper, and when you receive your Associate's, you can transfer to a university.  Many of the basic courses (English, Math, Social Studies) will be out of the way at a fraction of the cost it would be if you took it all at the university.      And consider living with your parents a plus.  You don't have to pay to rent a dorm or apartment and the extra money saved means more money towards classes and less money to borrow or pay back.|`|AA10023710	Some of the most prestigious universities and colleges in the US are also the most generous re: financial aid. Places like Harvard have promised to fund any student who is low income, and via grants and scholarships you don't have to pay off - you wouldn't even need loans!     When you apply to schools, be smart about it. Keep your financial situation in mind, and if your grades and SATs are very strong - making you think you could get into a place like Brandeis, for example - then apply to the best public university in your home state, and also apply to:  - all the expensive private schools that you like, focusing mainly on those that offer excellent financial aid, plus  - two or more private schools where your grades and SATs are above their normal averages. Schools like that will be likely to throw money in your direction to try to get you to attend.    The best public uni in your home state may offer you a lot of financial support, so you need to consider them. They may surprise you.

The game is far from mindless, I play in college and on my arm there are 60 plays for defense, offense is even more, football practice is treated like a classroom with daily film session and constant self improvement. Football is a science =D    Now WWE, that is the epitome of mindless, agressive, violent, testosterone-driven macho posturing, not football.

Or did you already learn it?    If  you're that knowledgeable, you should take a higher-level course or something.    Homework does suck. When I was in high school, my math teachers only graded in-class assignments and exams. They just gave us a "check" if it looked like we completed the assignment, lol.    I say it's fair because the teacher wants you to do homework. He or she thinks there's value in it, and you're taking their class and in your case, unfortunately you have to jump through the hoops to get the grade.    I've known a hell of a lot of "smart" people that do well on exams but never show up for class or do the assignments. They all flunked. That's the game though. Do your work to get the grade.

IwXuWX05aa	She sits alone in her library (everyone else having gone to bed) into the wee hours of the morning, all the while rapidly descending into the land of Not So Long Ago.(6)   Not So Long Ago was the time in which life was grand, everyone was safe, and her world was thick and rich with happiness, as though she dwelled in a delightfully bright ice creamery.  It was indeed a world of enchantment; nonetheless, it was her reality.(1)      Since the finality of the recent events shattered her world like a wrecking ball smashing a large bay window into a thousand shards of glass that pierced her heart, she endlessly examined, as tears fell like rain, why she couldn't stop the flow of those events that all too quickly led to the greatest loss of all.(2)  She replayed everything in her mind, trying to pinpoint a moment when she could have stopped it and changed the outcome, but to no avail. One moment he was there and the next, POOF!!, he was gone.(4)    So for these reasons, she temporarily finds relief in dreaming and descending into that yesterday place.  It is her vacation from the harshness of the world that greedily awaits her return.   And though she does not believe in a year of magical thinking, somehow she does believe that one day he will come back, just as he was before.(3)   Who can say what is truth, and who can fairly judge her?   There are so  many weird occurrences on this spheroid we call the planet Earth.   One such phenomenon took place just a few days ago.    You see, that Friday she had an important appointment at 10 a.m., but she  had lingered too long on Bleecker Street.  By the time she hit the highway, the windshield wipers couldn't keep up with the snow, ice and sleet falling down.   "Damn!" she uttered for she loathed driving on anything but clear roads on a sunny day.  Suddenly her icy wheels spun on their edges; she skidded off the road, across the median, and stopped dead when she hit a bumpy patch facing the oncoming traffic.(5)  Luckily, traffic was light because of the time of day.    Stunned, and without even wondering why her car had stopped so abruptly (which would have been typical of her under normal circumstances), she quickly grabbed the emergency cones from her back seat and put them down around her car.  Another black sports car pulled up behind her.  A young man stepped out and asked if she needed help.  "I d-d-don't know," she stammered.  She was starting to shiver in the cold.  "Here, take this blanket," he offered, handing her a thick, fuzzy blue wool blanket from his backseat.  "I know you're always cold."  She gratefully wrapped herself in it, not catching the inference in his last words.  He then placed some cones from his trunk around his own car.  "What's your name?" he asked nonchalantly.  "Molly...I think my name is Molly...W-What's yours?"(7)  He just gave her a brilliant white toothy smile and let out a tinkling litle laugh.  "Do you want me to call the police or can I check out your car for you?" he asked politely; but, without waiting for an answer, he stooped beside her wheels and tires squeezing and feeling them. He then threw open her hood and tinkered inside a moment and afterwards walked around the car feeling and examining everything.   He even spent some time underneath the car.  Without her  permission, he got inside the car, started the engine, looked at the warning lights and signals on the dashboard, checked the wipers, and gave it what seemed to be a thorough examination.  He backed it up, drove 20 ft. forward, and backed it up again.   She was amazed that a stranger would do all this for her.  As he walked over to her, he said, "Miss, you're one lucky lady.  As far as I can tell, your car has absolutely no damage.  Do you want it towed, though I can guarantee you that's not necessary, or can I follow you to your destination?"  This time she stared right into his face and her eyes quickly opened wide.  She let out a gasp of disbelief.  He gave a little laugh and said, "I will always be watching out for you.  I promised you that."  "What?" she asked, not quite believing her eyes or ears.  Though she recognized him, her mind was swirling in confusion.  How could it be?  She wanted to hug him but feared she would be proven wrong.  Maybe he was that twin we all hear about. "Raf!" she called.  He turned his face away and again offered to follow her.  "Of course!   We're going home. It's not far, and I'd love it if you could follow me."      They both got in their cars and within 20 minutes she was back in front of her house.  She jumped out of her car quickly, not to thank him, but to throw her arms around him.  During the drive, she became convinced she was right.  How she had missed him!  She would never forget his handsome face and the sound of his voice!  What shock she must have been in not to have recognized him immediately.  But as she turned around, his car was gone.  She stood there and a solitary tear, already starting to freeze, fell down her cheek.  As she turned to enter her brownstone, she noticed she was wearing her pajamas.  She looked up at the sky as it still emptied its buckets of snow and yelled  aloud, "Oh, hell.  Snow is SO strange!!"(8)        I think I ran out of steam  with the real world calling me and so it's not what I would consider my best effort.|`|MINy26pjaa	Yes I can, but why should I do your work for you?

2rdXW293aa	I think we've all "been there," when we just can't bring ourselves to do some homework or a project at work. The best I can tell you is, take small bites - tell yourself you're going to write one page right now. Then do another. Then another. If you can break it down by categories, that really helps. Don't keep looking at the big picture; it's obviously overwhelming you.    Give yourself a change of subject in between - not the TV, not the internet, but other homework. Then go back to the thing you "hate." The only way you can do this is to do this. A friend of mine got hung up writing his doctoral thesis. He got extensions. But he finally got there. You can too. Just don't keep telling yourself you're going to fail.    Try deep breathing. Try saying to yourself, "I know I can write this paper / pass this test. I'm smart; that's why I'm in honors English (etc.) I know I can do it again."     You WILL get through this. It's miserable for you right now, but you will pull through!    Exercise - is really helpful when you're stressed. Take walks, smash a tennis  ball, swim laps fast ... whatever you like to do. Keeps the blood flowing, and more oxygen to the brain.

It was therefore concluded that the survivability of a parent who searched their child's belongings was directly related to the child's experience with producing explosive compounds.

5oAU7S9zaa	Wife of the second President of the United States, Abigail Adams is an example of one kind of life lived by women in colonial, Revolutionary and early post-Revolutionary America. While she's perhaps best known simply as an early First Lady (before the term was used) and mother of another President, and perhaps known for the stance she took for women's rights in letters to her husband, Abigail Adams should also be known as a competent farm manager and financial manager.  Educated at home, Abigail Adams learned quickly and read widely. Her marriage to John Adams was warm and loving and also intellectually lively, to judge from their letters.    They had four children before John became involved in the Continental Congress. During his long absences, Abigail managed the family and the farm and corresponded not only with her husband but with many family members and friends. During the war, she also served as the primary educator of the children, including the future sixth U.S. president, John Quincy Adams.    When John served in Europe as a diplomatic representative of the new nation, Abigail Adams joined him.    John Adams served as Vice President of the United States from 1789-1797 and then as President 1797-1801. Abigail spent some of her time at home, managing the family financial affairs, and part of her time in the federal capital, in Philadelphia most of those years and, very briefly, in the new White House in Washington, D.C. (November 1800 - March 1801).     After John retired from public life at the end of his presidency, the couple lived quietly in Massachusetts.    It is mostly through her letters that we know much about the life and personality of this intelligent and perceptive woman of colonial America and the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary period.     Abigail Adams died in 1818, seven years before her son, John Quincy Adams, became the sixth president of the U.S.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	She was a very sickly child and as such was not formally educated.  They thought she would die young so didn't care to spend the resources.  She did however learn and was a remarkably well read woman for her time and was considered a voice tempered with reason in her communication with her husband John Adams.

5oAU7S9zaa	45 degrees 8/360(360 is the total measurement of exterior angles)|`|nusNVPmZaa	to find the measure of one exterior angle of a regular octagon, you must first find the measure of one interior angle which can be done by the equation 8-2(180) divided by 8, which is 135. you then subtract 135 from 180 to fin the exterior angle which is 45 degrees.    and as for the second one, im not completely sure but i think its a midsegment

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	The slope-intercept equation for a line is y = mx + b, where:   m is the slope of the line (rise/run)  b is the y-intercept point (point where the line crosses the y-axis, so (0, y))    Given the equation y = x + 1, to rewrite into slope-intercept form:  y = 1x + 1  where m = 1 and b = 1  So you know that your slope is 1 (for each value of x you go over 1, you also go up 1), and that the line crosses the y-axis at 1 (point (0,1).    To graph this, you first need to have drawn out your x and y axes on paper.    You can now plot the y-intercept point, (0,1).    Now you can either use the slope to plot some more points (over and up 1, left and down 1, and repeat for each new point), or you can write out a short x,y table by plugging in various values for x to get your resulting y coordinate:  y = x + 1  x, y  0,1  1,2  2,3  -1,0  -2,-1  etc.    after you have plotted a few points on the graph, draw a line through and past all the points.  Put arrows on each side of this line representing the equation, and you're done.|`|qlZAQYoHaa	The equation is already in slope intercept form!  y=mx+b. m=1, b=1.   So, let's get to graphing. Let x=0 first, always, always, always when graphing.   So, if x=0, y=0+1. y=1.   Since x=0 and y=1, the coordinate will be (0,1).   Next, let x=1. y=1+1, so y=2. Yet again, x=1 and y=2. (1,2).  Graph that next. Continue this process by increasing the value of x. You can also decrease the value of x, such as x=-1.   y=-1+1, so y=0. (-1,0). That's all there is to it!|`|kTI1lQ7Faa	1. The slope is one so you plot a point at (1,1) (2,2) etc. Then you make sure that you are starting at the poin (0,1)    I know kind of confusing! I hope I helped|`|7aa66115bc1bd96bb8bb6e742c9c6029aa	Ok, so for y = x+1make a chart like this:    if x=1 then y=2  if x=2 then y=3    it's actually pretty simple, so let me give you an example:    y=3x+2    so if x=1 then y=3(1)+2 which is y=5  and if x=2 then y=3(2)+2 which is y=8    so how you graph this is you use whatever x value you put into the equation then you get the y from solving the equation...so for the last equation the two points I showed you were (1,5) and (2,8)    I hope you get it now...

jcK6EXpiaa	I would like to correct some misconceptions. First of all, Europeans were not superior to all brown skinned people. the only reason they had more advanced weaponry was because of the Chinese, who invented it. It was the disgusting diseases those filthy people brought over here that did much of the killing for them. If we had immunities to those diseases, we would have overcome them, like the africans did. However, after just a few interactions with those water/soap-phobic settlers, many tribes died long before they ever got the opportunity to smell those invading people (and lucky for them, my grandpa said even when he was young you could smell most white people a few hundred feet away, thats how bad they stank) even with their "advanced weapons" if we hadn't shown them how to eat (they would have starved their first winter)  and fight (they just lined up and rounded shots, we taught them gurilla war fare) they would have all died off and left us be.|`|p0dxIZeSaa	All of this should be in your textbook but I'll tell you anyway.    The European settlers looked down upon the Natives because they viewed them as savages since they weren't Christian.  The Europeans also had a sense of cultural superiority and wanted to influence their culture all throughout the lands as well as take the Americas for themselves.     Also the Natives were aware of the settlers plan to overthrow them so they retaliated the best they could. Some Natives treated settlers like gods due to their prophecies while others had the complete opposite reaction.

It was a matter of greed on the first part, and a "looking-down-their-noses" upon the second culture simply because of the assessed inferiority or crudeness of the second culture by the first culture.  This is not an isolated occurrence between these two cultures.  I'm sure you're being impressed upon to believe that, but cultural mixtures over millenia have often proved one's sense of superiority over the other, and that's why slavery is nothing new in the American colonies.  You can read about that in the Bible in Egypt where the Hebrew were slaves, and if you do a cultural study over millenia and across the globe, you'll see this as a common occurrence, such as between the Japanese and Chinese.  God Bless you.

5oAU7S9zaa	World War I (abbreviated WWI or WW1; also known as the First World War, the Great War, and the War to End All Wars) was a global war fought chiefly in Europe from 1914 to 1918.[2]    The scale and intensity of the conflict were unprecedented, with more men fighting and more casualties in action than any prior human conflict. About 70 million soldiers took part in the fighting,[3] including 60 million Europeans.[4][5] New technologies - machine guns, better artillery, advanced logistics, poison gas, aerial warfare and submarines - increased the scale of the carnage. The war claimed over 40 million casualties, including approximately 20 million civilian and military dead.[6] Many of the events attendant upon the war - blockade, revolution, genocide and a global influenza pandemic - increased the misery.    The war had sweeping consequences for politics and diplomacy in the rest of the 20th century. The war resulted in the collapse and fragmentation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. The German Empire was overthrown, and Germany lost territory. As a consequence, the maps of Europe and the Middle East were re-drawn; ancient monarchies were replaced by communist or democratic republics. For the first time, an international body, the League of Nations, was created to prevent war ever occurring again. The terms of the treaties ending the war, and the instability of new nations, were important factors leading towards World War II twenty years later.    The causes of the war can be traced to the unification of Germany in 1871,[citation needed] and the uneasy balance of power among the European Great Powers in the opening years of the 20th century. Additional spurs to conflict included continuing French resentment over the loss of territory to Germany in the 19th century; growing economic, military and colonial competition between Britain and Germany; and the continuing instability of Austro-Hungarian rule in the Balkans.    The proximate trigger for the war was the 28 June 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Bosnian Serb. Austria-Hungary's demands for revenge against the Kingdom of Serbia led to the activation of a series of alliances which within weeks saw most European powers at war. Because of the global empires of many European nations, the war soon spread worldwide.    The war was fought between two major alliances. The Entente Powers initially consisted of France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and their associated empires and dependencies. Numerous other states joined these allies, most notably Japan in August 1914, Italy in April 1915, and the United States in April 1917. The Central Powers, so named because of their central location on the European continent, initially consisted of Germany and Austria-Hungary and their associated empires. The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in October 1914, followed a year later by Bulgaria. By the conclusion of the war, only The Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, the Scandinavian nations, and Monaco remained officially neutral among the European countries, though several may have provided financial and material support to one side or the other.    The fighting of the war mostly took place along several fronts that broadly encircled the European continent. The Western Front was marked by a system of trenches, breastworks, and fortifications separated by an area known as no man's land.[7] These fortifications stretched 475 miles (more than 600 kilometres)[7] and precipitated a style of fighting known as trench warfare. On the Eastern Front, the vastness of the eastern plains and the limited railroad network prevented the stalemate of the Western Front, though the scale of the conflict was just as large. There was heavy fighting on the Balkan Front, the Middle Eastern Front and the Italian Front; there were also hostilities at sea and in the air.      A graphic depiction of the state of international relations in pre-WWI Europe. Italy joined the Triple Entente in April 1915.On 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb student, shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne in Sarajevo. Princip was a member of Young Bosnia, a group whose aims included the unification of the South Slavs and independence from Austria-Hungary. The assassination in Sarajevo set into motion a series of fast-moving events that eventually escalated into full-scale war.[8] Austria-Hungary demanded action by Serbia to punish those responsible and, when Austria-Hungary deemed Serbia had not complied, declared war. Major European powers were at war within weeks because of overlapping agreements for collective defense and the complex nature of international alliances.

Keep a calendar so that you know when a project is due or a test is going to be given.    6. Vocabulary is very important. Words have different meanings. You need to know the meaning for the subject that you are taking.    7. Study the relationship of things. How is the topic that you studied related to the unit that you are studying?    8. Your textbook has hints for you. Many books have important words or phrases in darkened or colored type, make sure that you know them thoroughly.    The sites below are excellent and will give you many other ideas about studying.    http://www.d.umn.edu/kmc/student/loon/ac...    http://www.studygs.net/    http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/checklis.ht...    http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/stdyhlp.htm...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...
162ae2da11753300bccefeab623bb6bdaa	I would re-think the whole pharmacist thing as I believe that the job will gradually fade away as a national database will begin tracking medications as medicine is socialized. The need to look for drug interactions would be better served by computers and effective national databases for an individuals medication, which would also eliminate a lot of pharmaceutical abuse. Then the only job left is counting, there again another task that would be done better by machines.|`|mm2mjHVhaa	I'm a senior in college.  I'm currently applying for pharmacy school myself.  I can tell you that I do believe that you will be prepared to take the prereqs needed to get into pharmacy school when you go to college.  I've been out of school for ten years when I started college after I got out of the Marines.  I found the prereqs quite easy except for physics.  Good luck.
lbR1IoiSaa	If you're filling in information about your parents, and it asks for their title, yes, they're asking for Mr. Ms, Mrs . . . .     When it asks for who they're employed by, you give the name of the company.    When it asks for years with the firm (company), you provide the number of years your parent has been employed by that company.    Please don't waste your time with paper forms, go to http://www.fafsa.ed.gov    You can file your FAFSA for free there, unless your college/university requires a paper form as well (which they might, as some use a paper form to see what free $ they can give you - in addition to the federal government).     Good luck, and hope this helps!

jQjhIJzHaa	Range is 10 means the max is 48 and the min is 38    (48+44+42+38+Thursday+Friday+46)/7=43  Thursday+Friday=43*7-48-44-42-38-46=83    So if you add up the temperatures for Thursday and Friday you will get 83 degrees.    Now the median is 42.  There are already 3 days with temperatures higher than 42 which means you need three days with temperatures lower or equal to 42.  Therefore temperatures for both Thursday and Friday should be less than or equal to 42.  That suggests 42 for Friday and 41 for Thursday.

So the height must be greater than 8.051 cm (I rounded off the decimal)

1khVEE6oaa	Any number you put in for B will give an answer for A.  Did your teacher give you any more information than that?    For example, try B=1:  A=(3x1)+5  A=3+5  A=8    So when B=1, A=8      Now try B=6:  A=(3x6)+5  A=18+5  A=23    So when B=6, A=23      You will always get a different answer anytime you change B.  Are there more directions for this problem?
8zglJMdhaa	lol its plain simple  Ok think this,  We all know that 25 + 25 is 50   But 25 doesnt have a 18 difference with 25,  So what you do is start looking for numbers,  (the number) (18 numbers later)  1 -  19  2- 20  and so on until you find an answer which fits.  Gimme a sec to find the answer...      ________________________________  THE ANSWER IS: 16  beacause 16 + 18 (18 difference) = 34 and 34 + 16 is 50. :D  If it helped plz gimme best answer, I answered first.

CfR9itMeaa	1. 4 1/5  2. 1 10/39  3. 20    you have to take them out of mixed number form. So for the first you do   (3*2)+1 and that ends up being 7/3. Then when you have both fractions set up, you just multiply across. So it was 7 * 9 over 3 * 5 and that ends up being 63/15 which simplifies down to 4 1/5 because 15 goes into 63 four times, so after all the simplifying, you get 4 1/5.

Did they lose faith and a have a sense of hopelessness? How did they think? Are those that survived are the ones that are the most optimistic or in other words, the ones who thought positive thoughts? Are the ones who lost hope are the ones who did not make it?     You might be able to get a lot in this topic. You could describe their Religious background and tradition and how that played a role in their survival in such a inhumane environment. Try answering this question for your project: How did the survivors survive?    I recommend you read the book "Night" by Ellie Wiesel. It takes you in depth of how a young teenager survives Auschwitz. It basically answers the question above and may give you other ideas as well. "Night" is a Nobel Peace Prize award winning book so you should (if you haven't)  read it some time. Really sad book.

He also founded his own religion, one in which souls should be reincarnated and beans (yes the kind you eat) are EVIL.  Seriously.    Michelangelo (famous for the Sisteen Chapel and other famous and society influencing pieces of artwork.)    Bathed almost never and that's by 15th century standards.  Pretty gross. Rarely changed his clothes.  Almost never took off his shoes.  I mean he would sleep with his shoes on.       Nikola Tesla (famous for the radio, ac electricity, radar, ballistics, nuclear technology, computers and robotics).  Also suffered from severe OCD and was total germophobe.  He refused to touch anything that had the slightest hint of dirt.  He also refused to touch anything round which is no small task for a genius in the physics field.    And that's just a few of them.

C5E2liU8aa	For high school, you usually have a double major, education and your field.     I would suggest a direct certifiable field: history, English, Lit, math, science or something else like that.     Psych has the problem that, depending on your state, you may only be able to teach psych. Psych is NOT a required class.|`|5gkBaGZoaa	If you plan to teach in elementary school, you would major in Education (you may have a choice of emphasis, such as Curriculum and Development). If you want to teach in middle school (6-8th grade) you will need to major in the specific subject area you wish to teach, such as English or Science, with and Education minor.|`|hEFthejvaa	you're supposed to major in education; in that field you can specifically learn about phychology. i think you can do that by minoring in it or having a double major. best of luck!|`|ozgcoBkOaa	I am not sure what happens in the States but in any general Education programme, there usually is a Child Psychology course of some sort that takes new teachers in the development of the mind of a child and how children acquire learning (at different stages). In where I live, we call it "Educataionl Psychology," which also includes counselling courses.    I think you will find psychology fascinating and in any case, should you want to get a degree in psychology first and then an after degree in education, that will still do you good :)    Perhaps there are some people you can talk to at your current school or at a prospective college so you can get to know the programmes and what they involve. Best of luck in choosing!|`|wzHIaMrfaa	A psychology minor may be really helpful to you as a teacher (particularly with that age group).  However, you should try to find a school that offers an education program.  Some schools will add teaching licensure to a random degree but most education professionals (as well as hiring staff in schools) will want to see more knowledge of actual education systems, best practices, etc.

7uGMyGn2aa	He wasnt prepared at all to becoming Tsar, His dad died at 49 - he had been expected to reign for like another 20 years so Nicholas II had had no preparatiion such as no political training or imperial experince. He once said to his cousin: "What is going to happen to me and all of Russia?" suggesting nerves, and inexperience. Plus approaching his cousin with this question and not his advisors suggests, as you have mentioned, that he did not trust many ppl.   However it can be argued that he was fine with becoming Tsar. He believed in divine right - that he was chosen to rule by God - so surely that would imply he felt that becoming Tsar was the will of God, which would overpower his inexperience? This is shown by how he foolishly attempted to take personal control of the Russian army in the First World War when Russia on the eastern front was already in a desperate situation, and it allowed his position back in Russia to be undermined even further. He was a fragile, nervous man - not one fit to rule. He was ignorant of the needs of the ppl as he still tried to implement the outdated autocratic rules which previous Tsars had done.   However the collapse of the monarchy in Russia cannot be blamed on him persoanlly, nor can it be accreditied to the Bolsheviks. It was a result of WW1 (seen in Germany with the Kaiser abdicating).  I know not all of that was relevant to the question! but i hope it helped. Email me if you need anymore! my history teacher was awesome :p|`|7Vj0vaSyaa	from what i remember of GCSE history, he was very quiet and kept him and his family very private...this could have been for a number of reasons for example the fact that he may have been embarressed about his sons haemophilia disease.

AA11604732	When you consider the value of an MBA, you have to consider two things:    1.  The cost of tuition, fees, room and board.  2.  The value of the extra income you will receive.    The problem with going for inexpensive MBAs is that they generally do not lead to extra value once you have the degree.  Paying a lot of money to go to a ranked MBA program will pay off, while going to an unranked school will not increase your income enough to justify taking two years off.    Didn't you learn about the NPV rule in your undergraduate finance classes?    The US has 18 of the top 20 MBA programs in the world.  The only foreign schools that break the top 20 are London Business School and INSEAD.  You would be much better off staying in the US and paying to go to a good school than going anywhere else.    If your home state's best university has a good quality MBA program, consider that.|`|hEFthejvaa	the MBA progams in europe take only 1 year to complete & the tuition is half as much as in the U.S.  you should consider that...|`|3a827c8f65201304f6aa82c6d68a323eaa	You get what you pay for in MBAs. They get to charge those prices and have people line up to pay them because of the salaries they yield. A crummy MBA isn't worth the low tuition, the year or two or the paper it's printed on.    Go work your way up in a company, do well on the GMAT and then go to a good program.|`|1HLIKuTvaa	Ranto has it right.  In addition, many MBA programs are not AACSB accredited...without that accreditation, the school is not considered to offer an elite degree.    Some schools are now requiring the passing of the CMBA (those not AACSB accredited), and the test is failed by people with MBAs from all schools...so, that is a 3rd tier option.

XZatdDHjaa	The perimeter is the sums of the distances.    Distance from (-2,2) to (6,8) = sqrt[(6+2)^2 + (8-2)^2] = 10  Distance from (6,8) to (6,2) = sqrt[(0^2) + (8-2)^2] = 6  Distance from (6,2) to (-2, 2) = sqrt[(6+2)^2 + (0^2)] = 8    The perimeter is 6+8+10 = 24.|`|AA10439008	From (-2,2) to (6,2) is straight across 8 units.  Then from (6,2) up to (6,8) is straight up 6 more.  So that's 14 so far.    The slanted path from (6,8) back to (-2,2) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 6 and 8 (as shown above) so by Pythagorean Theorem, it's  (6^2 + 8^2) = (36 + 64) = 100 = 10    so add that to the 14 and you have it
AA10251481	1) Go to the bank and get 2 or 3 rolls of nickels.  2) Use flashcards.  Do one number set per night.  Start with the "two's."  3) After she learns all of the two's, pay her a nickel for each fact she got right.  4) Repeat each night, until all are learned (don't re-pay the previously learned facts, however.)  5)  She will learn them all over the course of a couple of weeks.   6) Count her money with her nightly (this teaches the five's, also.)  When she's done, take her to Burger King dutch-treat.    Trust me, this works.  I have done it with my daughter, with several students, and with foster children.

My son stayed home from 7th grade on.  He graduated early, is now a solid high B in college, getting his EMT license, is a volunteer fireman and has his own DJ business--he'll be 19 in April.  He loved learning at his own pace and  continues to learn outside the realm of college.    He was motivated to learn too.  That being said, he wasn't motivated to learn math and now really struggles there.  I'm not convinced he wouldn't have had that issue had he done traditional school.  All of his friends went to traditonal or Catholic high school and he is miles ahead in some areas and slightly behind in others.  He's very well read and knowledgeable in history, but lagging in math and science.      There are millions of on line homeschool sites to look into.  Look into what is required of your parents legally in your state and see if you can't find a local group of homeschoolers you can talk to as well.      My neice has a processing disorder as well and homeschooling has been the right choice for her.  Make sure you don't isololate yourself socially and know what your future goals are and prepare accordingly.

As for approaching your parents about the idea, I would make it clear that:    (1) You love having your social life and enjoy getting involved.    (2) You nevertheless know how important an education is, and that is your primary focus and concern.    (3) Because of your auditory processing disorder, and the fact that you consequently end up having to teach everything to yourself once you get home, you cant help but realize how much *academic* time is being wasted at school, and how much further along you could be if you didnt have to constantly counteract, and compensate for, the school systems style of teaching.    (4) There are some truly excellent online education programs out there (be sure to fully research them first!) by which you feel confident you will make much greater progress academically, as these programs bypass your auditory processing disorder.    (5) Your parents will need to have only a minimal supervisory role in your homeschooling, because of the wide array of comprehensive online programs now available.    (6) You are not going to give up your friends or drop out of the social world.  Its just that you realize how extremely important academic achievement is in this culture/world, and you are determined to live up to and develop your abilities in the best possible way, with the fewest impediments along the way.      If your parents insist that, because you are already earning straight A's,  there's no reason to take you out of school, simply remind them that if you weren't spending so much time "re-teaching" yourself, you could be so much further along in TRUE learning, which is what will get you ahead in life in the long run, not the mere A's.    Rooting for you and wishing you all the best.|`|rfwbZ2AXaa	You should stay in school.  Even if you are reteaching yourself at home, you are getting the social interaction and repeated practices at school.  I know it is hard, my son is autistic and has an oversensitivity disorder, but we are keeping him in school rather than homeschooling so that he can get the experience of being in crowded situations, confusing situations, and trying to cope.

AA11604732	People tell you need lots of extracurriculars -- but the truth is that they are easy to pad and hard to verify -- so the elite colleges don't weight them nearly as much as you think.  You are doing fine there.    Your grades are a bit low for Penn.  It is highly unlikely that you could get into Wharton with those grades, so I think you should apply to The College (Arts & Sciences).  Your grades are low for them, too -- but you have a much better shot there.    You will need 2200+ on your SATs.    The most important thing for you is that you need to submit a well crafted admissions essay.  Without a great essay, you will not get into Penn.  With high SAT scores, slightly better grades and an incredible essay, you have a shot.  Overall, I don't like your chances.|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	In order to make your application stand out from the approximate 5000 they get per 1/2 year, try really selling yourself in your essay. First off think about writing something along the lines of what make you different than other students applying.

It may also help if you visit the school itself. Meet with an admissions adviser and introduce yourself personally.

tCsFxh5Aaa	Coaching any kind of academic team means taking time to host practices.  Learning the rules of the competition.  Helping the students to improve.  Arranging transportation to competitions and chaperoning the students while at competitions and practices.    With a speech team, you'd want to have them make practice giving speeches, and give them feedback on ways to improve their speaking.  Give them hints like looking slightly over the heads of people in order to not be quite so nervous while still appearing to talk to the audience.  Or making them notice bad speaking habits such as using "um" or "like" too often, or shifting their feet too much, or speaking too softly or too quickly.  Or helping them learn to organize or research their speeches.    Coaching an academic team takes extra time out of your schedule and is often a duty relegated to the newest teacher.  But it can be more fun than other teaching duties since the kids involved in a team are motivated and want to be there...

pEbnucqNaa	I would definitely go with Northwestern.      All of the journalism professors are journalists so they know what they're talking about, and Chicago is a great news area.    The biggest draw is probably the residency program that every Medill student takes junior year.  For one quarter you get real experience interning at cool places like People or Newsweek.    Be ready for tons of writing, though.  They work you to death, but after two weeks your writing is already 10 times better.|`|HJbqA4hkaa	Columbia does not have an undergrad journalism program, just a grad schools.

pQ3fzgjBaa	In a philosophy major there's always going to be at least one logic class, and usually some statistics and probability too.    The general required math for any major is usually any math you want that's above the remedial level. But you'll probably need to take college algebra because it's almost always a prerequisite to other more advanced math classes.|`|AA10792562	Philosophy majors take a course in Symbolic Logic.  Math majors may take that course too because it is math-like.  That course manipulates algebra-like variables to prove statements symbolically.    In any major there is probably a general math requirement of one or two math courses.  If you have a choice take statistics.

She's probably trying to remind herself, you, and anyone else in earshot that she still has some power of her own. Don't take it personally, and ask the teacher what his/her procedure is for dealing with disrespectful language. You might also calmly and respectfully tell the student that you're there to give her whatever support she needs, but only if she treats you in a respectful way. If she manages to make you upset or angry, the situation will get worse.|`|OAo5t5FRaa	it always happens, there a re different types of ppl on each and everyone class, theres the class clown the teachers pet and the disresctful ones like that one, and many more.Good Luck with that one :)

When I worked for the Seattle Public Library as a library associate, there were at least three of us with our masters waiting to be promoted.      I also would believe that the reason why no librarian would move to the wilderness to take those obscure jobs is that they pay only slightly better than the federal minimum wage, so ask yourself if that's what you want.

In English however, you may need to think about taking appropriate classes to improve spelling and grammar. For example, "I" must always be capitalized.

This amount is depended upon the fees and other expenses that the borrowers want to cover under student loans.

YOu're a saint.  Ask ONE question from above and be sure your kids are prepared for it. TELL them the answer before you give the test. Or better yet, have them write the answer and then go over it in detail. Have them correct it. Write it on the board - have them copy it.  Then collect it and give the test for real. EXPECT 100% from ea. student.   How do you expect them to learn if you give them these way out questions? Everything you do as a teacher should be a learning experience, not a challenge.   Do not test for what you didn't teach. Not fair!

Thanks  Bill|`|1d14374c18dd2ea2439ca751779f47e2aa	My suggestion is to go 1 year at a local regional campus or Community College and get a college GPA (4.0) if you really want to go to those colleges and do well. THEN you can go anywhere you want! Your grades are good, but not perfect, and not a 4.2 on a 4.0 scale. Unfortunately, Ivy Schools, like Brown, want super-genius kids from private schools. Browns is also Private and has no PUBLIC FIN. AID.     I recommend a state college, especially once you want to do Journalism, which is not a top ten academic field nor a highly specialize program like Engineering or Nursing. Public Colleges can give you more personalized training with a better support system. Your more likely to met locals who have an 'in' in the industry. It's also not a cut-throat career, so getting an A in Psychology is not a priority to your program, nor will you have to have any fancy foreign languages. Which is a good thing.     Build a support system, do well in school, but have fun and don't get wrapped up in being the best in HS. Enjoy being a teen, and plan wisely for your future. You don't have to run out of state to find a great school, especially in hard economic times. Apply for tons of scholarships and you should look at doing an internship at a local public access station in area.     Trust me the kids who live near the schools you mentioned in Texas and Pittsburgh are looking at your state college, because it's far away from their home too. Sometimes a good thing is not that far away after all.

Just do well on your SATs and get involved in lots of extracurricular activities.|`|YM2ED4mfaa	In your case, you need to up all of your grades this coming semester and bust your a s s to get into that college you want. If it is a state school, you may be out of luck, but you CAN go to a community college, go for two years, get your grades up, and transfer later. Colleges don't look at weighted GPAs so your main concern right now is just getting your GPA as high as you can, doing well on your ACT/SAT test, and make sure you have alot of extracurriculars and community involvement.     I was the captain of the cheer team, never failed a class, was in the school musical, show choir, and took more AP classes than anyone in the school. I didn't get into my top choice school (University of Wisconsin Madison).

D eventually so for now just focus on getting a B.S. in Physics. I've heard that the University of Texas is a pretty reputable school. Most people don't do their grad school at the same college so focus on undergrad for now. Jobs aren't that important in the academic realm, you'll want to focus on research because professors support themselves mainly through research grants.|`|89qgMZjiaa	If you want to teach at the University level, your best bet is to go to college and skip the jobs.  You may need a job while in college to make ends meet, but don't worry about working in your field.  Meanwhile, choose any college that offers a B.S. in physics or applied sciences.  While there, the college will help you find a graduate program to get your M.S. in physics or applied science.  While in graduate school, you will find various doctoral programs that you can apply to when you're ready to write your dissertation and begin graduate teaching.  When you're done there, you'll have your P.h.D. and be ready to find a college to teach at.  If you do it all in one pass, and don't stop for that silly life thing, it should take you in the vicinity of 8 - 10 years.  Good luck.

There are many agencies that can help you for studying abroad. One such organization is GEI, here is the link http://www.gei-india.com/ . They will help you in choosing college and preparing you for graduate studies in US.

XbIoIUclaa	1. You are making foreign made goods more expensive for your people to buy.     2. Other countries may raise their tariffs against your goods as a reprisal.|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	all your citizens are forced to pay more for lower quality/more expensive items and other countries can put tarrifs on their goods as well. In some cases I would agree that it wasnt all bad. Also people need to look at why something is less expensive. If its because the other country doesnt have child labor laws, or because that country has almost 0 environmental protection requirements, then a tarrif is good for our country.|`|ccbe102f74b6b3b7bc011011a98bdaf8aa	I am an econ major so I will probably provide way more information than you need but if nothing else you can impress someone with it.     The idea of supply and demand is that a country will produce the amount of goods that consumers (you and I) demand. If the demand is higher than the home country's supply, or the foreign country can produce the product for cheaper home will import to again make supply equal demand.    When the importing government uses a tariff it essentially raises the price of the incoming foreign good, when this happens the home producers (companies making the product) raise their price to this point as well, why not charge more if you can is the logic behind this.     I will now refer to the graph in my source to explain it a little better. So what happens is when the price goes up consumers can buy less, or at least choose to buy less. The effects of this are consumers lose areas a,b,c and d in the graph; producers gain area a; and government gains area c (due to taxes which is what the tariff actually is). Therefor deadweight loss (the parts no one gets) are areas b and d, creating a negative effect on society as a whole.    So a simple answer is consumers lose more than producers and the government gain.     A tariff can help the country IF the gains of the government is large enough to be a price setting economy, in other words it's demand is big enough to effect world demand. This last part is probably far beyond what you needed to know but if you really want to blow your teacher away use that.

EbxMItf8aa	Let's take this one part at a time.    6^3 (2^x)^3 can be written as (2^3) (3^3) (2^x)^3    Remembering the rules for multiplying using indices, (2^x)^3 = (2^3x)    And (2^3) x (2^3x)  =  2^(3x + 3)    So  6^3 (2^x)^3 is the same as  2^(3x + 3) (3^3) ..... ..... ..... (A)    The first part, (2^5) (3^3) (8^x) / 4 can be written as    {(2^5) (3^3) (2^3)^x } / 4    and again, using the rules for working with indices,      = (2^5) (2^3x) (3^3) /4     = 2^(3x + 5) 3^3 /4 ..... ..... ..... ..... (B)    Putting (A) and (B) back together, we get     2^(3x + 5) 3^3 /4  +  2^(3x + 3) (3^3)     Since 4 = 2^2, let us factorise the first term like this      2^(3x + 3) . 2^2 . 3^3 / 4, then the 2^2 and the 4 in the denominator cancel, leaving     2^(3x + 3) . 3^3    So the complete expression is now      2^(3x + 3) . 3^3  +  2^(3x + 3) . 3^3     = 2 {2^(3x + 3) . 3^3}    We can combine the 2 outside the bracket with 2^(3x + 3)  inside to give     = 2^(3x+ 4) . 3^3    Finally, we can write 3^3 as 27, of course, so we end up with     = 27 { 2^(3x + 4) }
9G03aQhsaa	Im writing because, Yujin told me that she cant change her current schedule regarding  her PE8 class.    Yujin did not really want to take the PE8 course during her 1st term because, she was told PE is much harder here than in Korea. She wanted to take some time and to get ready for the class. I didnt think there would be a problem with her taking it in the second term instead.  When we visited your office, you were very kind and changed her schedule so she could take a computer course on her first term and PE8 on her second term.    Now, I realize this may not be a good idea, since it will mean she will have to take PE8 4 times a week next term.  She will be the only student taking it this often in one term.    While I do not want her to have any trouble in Gr. 9, I also do not want her to have to take PE8 4 times in one term if it can be avoided.    After looking at the schedule I received on September 23, 08, which says that she can take PE8 twice a week as shown below, I was wondering if there was anyway that she could complete her PE8 requirement in the first term of Gr. 9.    I want to do what is best for Yujin, so I will follow your advise. I apologize for the confusion; it took a little while to see how the schedule worked.

Z4PxfObXaa	Conflict means you have a problem or an issue.  In order to fix whatever is wrong, you have to come up with a solution.  Solution is a form of progression because you are moving forward and away from the problem.  For example, if there is an issue with excessive car accidents, a city might add more traffic lights, crossing guards, or stop signs.  If a team is having a conflict with one of the players, the coach may remove him from the game; therefore, the team may progress.

No one knows what are the decisions that will have the best results, and people will always debate and argue over their point of view.

While , you won't get to do any of the work that nurse do at least you will get an idea of what they do. 2nd, nursing is NOT like ER or Scrubs. The doctor is not there the majority of the time and most of the time it will be up to you to make split second life decisions.Just because you want to work on maternity it will be a little more lax, but the dangers to the patients are not any less significant. you are talking about bringing a life into this world here.Don't go into nursing for the money you will earn every single penny and more. If you can't stand poop ,vomit, decay,blood, etc,etc, then this isn't for you. can't stand mean doctors and obnoxious family. Then this isn't for you.can't stand lazy co workers, then this isn't for you. Try to see if you can interview a nurse or student nurse near you to get a broader picture.|`|AA10023710	I don't know if you're old enough to volunteer in a hospital yet, but that'd be a really good idea. You could volunteer there, and get familiar with the environment, maybe meet some OB/GYN nurses, and ask them what their jobs are like. Learn about other types of nursing as well, while you're there.    This would not only help you learn more about nursing, but it also looks good on a college nursing major's application, if they've actually had some hospital related volunteer work in their past.     Maybe this is something you can ask your guidance counsellor about, and if you're not old enough for it quite yet, you can do it when you get to high school.|`|ec58996b2eb0d83a7a8e970fcbe0707faa	You'll be fine.

AA10023710	Your school should be able to provide you with guidelines re: what they're looking for in students. I'd be hesitant to have you take a score sheet or guidelines from another school, because what that other school is looking for in a student could be quite different from what your school is looking for.     Ask your own college's admissions department. They should be able to help.

There are programs that prepare you to do the technical work on a film -- say, work as a cameraman -- as well as programs that prepare you to become a director or a screenwriter.  Ideally you want a program that offers internships because those offer practical experience and can lead to job offers.

I don't like it- I make friends with dudes better than I do with girls. They're all so... girly where I live! *shudder*    If it's for a sexual education classroom, maybe. Physical education I understand, too, because of separate locker rooms and different overall taste in sports. But all other classes... I really don't see a problem with both males and females sitting around, half-asleep, learning algebra.    Irish_lad_921: I have never in a million years witnessed these events take place in most classrooms. Only place was in the girls' locker room when a chick asked our coach for a pad. End conversation, nothing was said, the pad was given, no questions. If it's a sex ed class or one of those abstinence programs, sure- but not when the teacher is explaining parts of speech.    Also, single-sex classrooms would call for more rooms and teachers. Some schools can't afford that. It's pretty ridiculous. Though I can see that more people can get teaching jobs, they might not be able to afford the paychecks.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	i think there good even thought there both being taught the same thing.

Then 3 1/3x+30=180. Simplify again and 3 1/3x=150. then x=45. Then you fit x into the equation. so a=45 degrees, b=90, and c= 45. The triangle is a right isosceles triangle. It's a right triangle because of the 90 degrees. It's isosceles because the two sides are congruent. But, if you just have to classify by angles it's a right triangle.

AA10023710	As the first poster said, it depends on the college. But for the top universities, you need foreign language in high school in order to get in. But their definition of foreign language - now that's where it gets interesting for you. Some top unis require that it be a human language, but others will allow it to be a computer language. This is something you should check with each university you're interested in about.     But in general, yes, you need at least two years of the same foreign language, in high school, in order to get into many colleges. But as I said, again, check with the unis that you're interested in, becuase it does vary by college, and some will consider computer languages instead.|`|bc01845fb56e1620d151494056c98daaaa	That all depends on the University/College, but no.

If anything college's look at your overall test scores and not necessarily what you have studied.

3jhUTJedaa	okay, changing as little as possible:      The cause which I stated in the beginning was that the government is preparing to hire math and science teachers. As I stated before, math and science are the weakest parts. According to research, the biggest reason is inability to be a teacher. Of course, this problem is not only for math and science teachers. However, math and science are more sensitive than other subjects because they are the hardest and most important subjects. Students cant do math and science work by themselves otherwise teachers dont teach or help them. As I recall on high school life, there were good math and science teachers for sure.

You've visited a lot of open days and you are not quite sure about your ultimate decision. There are two major universities you like most. Compare and contrast everything you've heard and everything you know about these two educational establishments.       You are going to your summer vacation. You've already chosen a gorgeous resort for your vacation, but hesitate about the kind of transport you'll take for your trip. You are not quite sure what way of traveling is more comfortable and suitable: a bus or an airplane. Compare and contrast these two means of transportation.       You are going to study in Germany. You don't know anything about the educational system in this country. You decide to approach to this question seriously, as your future depends directly on your choice. You try to get to know more about the educational system in Germany. You haven't decided yet whether you are ready to leave your native country. Compare and contrast educational systems in America and Germany.       You are working in the IT Company. Your company is going to make a purchase of new consignment of computers wholesale. You were assigned to be responsible for this, to make the analysis of the market, to detect what kind of processor is more reliable: Mackintosh or Intel. Compare and contrast characteristics of these two processors.       Your parents are going to move to the country. You strongly object to it. For this purpose you make the comparative and contrast analysis of living in the city with living in the country.|`|GM7y4S64aa	Assuming you have no topic, just pick something completely random.     You can contrast almost everything.|`|WXO67wNDaa	Contrast Nature,,,,like the different features of natures such as rivers, lakes, mountains, forestry, fertile steppes(grass) and other identified nature. this is bound to work for an essay.....10 points?|`|gLzJEX7Daa	I just did one of these.  It was on a Six Flags park versus a Disney theme park.  There's tons of information on the internet on both of them, so research was great because there was so much information to use.|`|sX86etcsaa	Contrast the governments of when our country first created the Constitution and today's governments. And what was more dominant and how it related to the economy then. Like that?|`|Eg0WqKmBaa	religion, abortion, euthanasia?  i typically go for controversial issues to get a rise out of people.  it makes it easier to write that way because more people have an opinion on it so you can get a lot more research.|`|ky5qOKSIaa	Do you know what contrast means?    Find things that differ. =]        Hope this helps.|`|p0WEjAwdaa	...you didnt even tell us what the subject is, or what you have to contrast it with, or what the theme is...  0.o  good luck with your work  :S
c5UAa65qaa	My guess is that she wants you to pay for tutoring because she really wants you to take responsibility for both your failure last semester and your improvement.  If you just go with the free option, she might be worried that you won't use it.  Show her that free tutoring will actually do more to help you than the paid variety (which might require some research on your part), and you're open to other methods of being held accountable, and maybe she'll reconsider.
jQjhIJzHaa	If you have a line with slope 2 passing through the points (-4,8).    Point Slope Form:  (y-8)=2(x+4)    Slope Intercept form: Solve "point slope form" for y    y-8=2x+8  y = 2x+8+8  y=2x+16    Standard Form: (In slope-intercept form, just move the y to the right, then get rid of any fractions)    y=2x+16  0=2x+16-y    2x-y+16=0      If you had  y=1/3x-1/4    You would do    1/3x-y-1/4=0  Then multiply both sides by 12 to get rid of fractions  4x-12y-3=0
jQjhIJzHaa	y=2-cos(x)    You can rewrite this as    y=-cos(x)+2      So the +2 translates the graph vertically by 2 units (up)
xxT7YGcMaa	Just alittle wordy, but makes perfect sense after reading it twice slowly.|`|vYBwau4qaa	Yes! you might want to substitute certain words to help with its coherence.|`|nrwmpQg7aa	Yes it does sound a little wordy!
zh9kfW5Eaa	She let out a cacophony when she broke her wrist.    The movement of the animal was nimble as it caught its prey.     The boy hoped that the tiger wouldn't lunge at him.     The mother couldn't endure the pain of losing her kids.     The patient was found to have intestinal obstruction.        That will get you started. Try google to see what the words mean.|`|6mIlSJK0aa	At the slight diversion the nimble man lunged out of the barracks not wanting to linger a second longer.    The man endured great agitation at the cacophony of sounds that were like slate in his ears.    -.- sorry i cant think of anything else.|`|WjSgHbf2aa	The CACOPHONY of the NIMBLE soldiers was PRIMITIVE to the higher trained solders.    The soldier LUNGED with his BAYONET    The army had to ENDURE the long battle    OBSTRUCTION of justice is a serious crime    the PRIMITIVE mechanism just HOISTed the SLATE    The soldiers hat to create a DIVERSION to prevent the army from destrying the BARRACKS.    the fireman EXTINGUISHED the fire.    The BROOD of frogs was quite a sight.    The strawberry was SUCCULENT    Be careful not to AGITATE the natural order of things.    To LINGER is sometimes known to be conspicuous    The data was STAGGERing    UNBEKNOWNST to the man, his wife had planned a surprise party        Hopefully you can use different tenses, as I had    Hope this helps|`|EvLS2pRjaa	There was a diversion between india and pakistan.
MINy26pjaa	A computer program just cannot replace actual knowledge. Computers can only read the words and apply general rules which may not apply to the ideas you are trying to express.  Even spell check is only marginally useful, as it can recognize whether a word is a proper spelling of a known word but not whether the spelling you used is the right one for the idea you want.  Spell check will tell you that 'They're thyme was cheep' is correct when actually it's not even close to 'Their time was cheap'.       The only 'grammar programs' free or otherwise, are the efforts teachers are making to educate you in the English language.  It is up to you from there, it can't help you if you don't make the effort to learn it.|`|EvLS2pRjaa	the program has not been invented|`|AA11202852	Sorry, but such a program doesn't exist. You need a second pair of eyes to look at what you've read and help you with proofreading and editing.
