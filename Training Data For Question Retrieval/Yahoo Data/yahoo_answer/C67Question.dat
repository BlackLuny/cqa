20090304123901AA3xirJ	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are there so many school shootings in the US?	It can't have anything to do with the availability of guns.  I'm sure kids would get guns anyway and go shoot their classmates, even if the guns weren't available, because if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have them.  Maybe the solution to this is to have better mental health screening for students.  No child should be allowed to enter school or college without a mandatory annual psychological examination.  That would ensure that deranged students do not enter classrooms.  But the teacher would have to check everyone's mental health certificates at the door, and if she doesn't, then someone may enter without the evaluation.  That might not work.  Maybe the solution is to crack down on the root causes, which are violent video games and TV shows.  If kids in America only watched Barney and Sesame Street like kids in Britain, there would be a lot less school shootings.  This would be much better than  trying to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, because passing any gun laws whatsoever is going to lead to a tyrannical oppression with the government enslaving all its citizens for its own selfish interest, and the people won't have guns to kill the army that tried to  oppress them.  Furthermore, guns don't kill people, people kill people.  So it's not really fair to the gun to restrict its use when it wasn't its fault that it was used improperly by a third party.
20090304123835AALFE5L	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Shouldn't this professor be fired?	A stupid liberal boneheaded professor in Connecticut reported one of her students to the police after he gave a class presentation on why students and teachers should be allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus. Now, free speech activists say the professor’s actions are what really need to be investigated.      Last October, John Wahlberg and two classmates at Central Connecticut State University gave an oral presentation for a communications class taught by Professor Paula Anderson(an obvious liberal fool). The assignment was to discuss a “relevant issue in the media,” and the students presented their view that the death toll in the April 2007 Virginia Tech shooting massacre would have been lower if professors and students had been carrying guns.      That night, police called Wahlberg, a 23-year-old senior, and asked him to come to the station. When he arrived, they they read off a list of firearms that were registered in his name and asked where he kept them(he should have told them to pack sand up their butts). Guns are strictly prohibited on the CCSU campus and residence halls, but Wahlberg says he lives 20 miles off-campus and keeps his gun collection locked up in a safe. No further action was taken by police or administrators.      “I don’t think that Professor Anderson was justified in calling the CCSU police over a clearly non-threatening matter,” Wahlberg told The Recorder, the CCSU student newspaper that first reported the story. “Although the topic of discussion may have made a few individuals uncomfortable, there was no need to label me as a threat.”

I'm not doing this to offend republicans because I believe some of their leaders have good ideas. I respect republican leaders such as the governor of Florida. I was just wondering because it seems as if a lot of Republicans use to term socialism to describe Obama's current policies. I am currently in mine thrid year of studying politcal ideologies at Exeter College, Oxford university  and what is happening in America does not seem like socialism to me. I guess AI can see how many might consider the huge government intervention as necessary, but from what I have seen from the study of past recessions and depressions, it is necessary.

I know it's been a debate that's been going on for years now, as far as I can remember. And I'm only pretty sure it's been asked numerous times on Y! Answers.   But seriously, why haven't they yet?? For those of you that have experimented with drugs know that marijuana, mary jane, reefer, ganja, whatever you want to call it, isn't half as bad as other drugs out there. [examples; cocaine, pills, ecstasy, heroin]   Personally I don't see anything wrong with smoking some and perusing the giggles and munchies. There's never been not even a single death related with marijuana drug use. Yeah sure it's mentally addicting, but aren't there so many alcholocis out there? And alcohol is another story, related with drunk driving, domestic violence, etc etc.    I'm not an expert in politics or anything, but why don't they tax it like they do with alcohol or cigarettes? Especially during these times, when the economy is almost non-existent.

20090304124919AAjx7aX	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Please help--Extreme unfair employee treatment, need advice, support?	This might be long-winded, but please bear with me, I need some sincere advice right now...      My mother has been employed for a retail chocolate company for the past 6 years. During this time she has always worked 'mother's' hours (hours between opening and 3-4 PM).      This company that she works for has no support system, and the HR department is internal, which means all complaints are dealt with BY the company. This to me in itself seems backward because in all of the places I've worked retail the HR depts were a seperate entity and calls and complaints were confidential. This will serve only to compound her problem.      Her particular store of employment has been without manager or assistant manager for the past few months. In this time my mother has worked her hardest to ensure everything ran smoothly and was in order, because no one else was and also because she knew the most/was there the longest of anyone.       Now without warning the company brings in a manager as well as an assistant. NEVER did they offer this position to my mother or her co-workers (who were beyond capable and certainly deserving of at least a nod)! So now what has happened is the small hourly pay budget they have went from being split between 4 people to 6 people, and my mother's hours (which have been the same for 6 years) were slashed.      Ok, her hours cut was a bit extreme (from 27 to 16) but I convinced her that this is retail and sometimes this happens, you just have to roll with the punches. She's accepted that reality and moved on.      Now she comes home today almost in tears because somehow, though the budget has stayed the same, she is only scheduled for 6 hours next week. She doesn't understand why or how and to boot tried to speak with the new manager who was avoidant and condescending. I feel such grave sadness for my mother right now. I know how much she liked her job and now to see this happening to her is so unfair. She even said to me, 'I learned to deal with the first cut. But this seems so malicious.'       Please, it is all coming out of no where and it seems as though the sh*t is really hitting the fan. This is not just a regular 'laid off' thing they are doing it slowly and methodically, and to make things worse there is absolutely NO PLACE that she can turn to, the HR dept of this company being merely a facade...      Please, if anyone has any advice or any kind words to keep the spirits up, It would be appreciated times infinity. Just really need some advice right now and seems all I'm getting are brick walls...         Thank you for your time and God Bless

I don't really want to spend much sorting it as I'm putting them on Ebay for a low starting price just to see what they get.(I've only worn them once and they were pretty expensive).      Can I get that bit shiny again?      I thought if anyone would know about this question someone in this section would that's why I asked it here.I can't get hold of my ex-army mate until the weekend!      Thanks.

20090304141351AA6kTPB	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Is an apple worth a thousand apples?	… so… in response to one of my previous questions, one respondent posts this:      “nothing has intrinsic value, everything only has the value we imbue it. we are all islands surrounded by ocean”      (I’m pretty sure if I go to ‘Wikipedia Ayn Rand’, I can find that direct quote.)      This is the way my confused thought process goes on this scenario:      If the apple is intrinsically worthless then the only ‘value’ of the apple is established by my subjective interpretation of the apple and if my subjective interpretation is hypothetically unlimited then the apple possesses potentially unlimited subjective value and that means the apple always potentially possesses the value of a thousand apples.      Now, that sounds pretty stupid to me, and the Ayn Rand disciple will immediately counter, “that doesn’t mean anybody else will ever actually recognize that value” (which sounds like recognition of objective reality to me, but let’s indulge the subjective theorist and pretend we didn’t notice that) but ultimately, this kind of thinking is precisely what we do when we ‘invest’ in a ‘market’, and the potential consequences of this kind of ideology ought to be abundantly obvious to most of us… right… about… NOW…      As the value of our investments plummets, we suddenly realize the apple we contributed five years ago is today… AN APPLE… as opposed to the thousand apples we were so sure would miraculously appear based on the single criterion of our grandiose expectations.      I contend an apple is an apple as opposed to a thousand apples, and any contrary subjective interpretation is the product of profound mental deficiency without basis in material reality. In addition, I contend these are not ‘opinions’, each equally valid with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, but that reality is DEMONSTRABLY OBJECTIVE, and belief that reality is subjective is simply DEMONSTRABLY WRONG.  (I’ve got more if you don’t appreciate this one. I’m starting with the simplest, clearest version.)      … so the question is…      Is reality objective (that means you observe, measure, experience and discover reality, such as GRAVITY for example) or is reality subjective (that means you float on a flying carpet in a magical faerie dream realm where marshmallow clouds rain down chocolate gum drops whenever you are hungry, if that’s not enough, you can always wiggle your nose at an apple and turn it into a thousand apples)?

I say; "that's not proof"      They rush to the internet and come back with thousands of links from other liberals all saying Bush is a liar. Doesn't prove Bush is a liar. I've never seen a liberal that could actually come up with even one lie that Bush told.       They'll call his opinions "lies", they'll call his policies "lies" but it all boils down to simply redefining "lie" to be something you disagree with.

(i believe. one of them i payed, the other one was a driving ticket that i got taken off my record by taking defensive driving)      defensive driving is not an option for me.      all i have for my case is this. You're driving in Road A, which is a 50mph zone, turn left and continue until you reach a T-intersection. The left turn is where the school zone starts. i made another left at the stop light and got pulled over. but, there's two things.   one:there is a school zone sign on the opposite side of the road which makes it seem that the school zone for my side of the road has ended. and for two, after you make the second left and you're still in the school zone, there is one up ahead on the left side of the road, where the light flashes at you. so it makes it confusing.   do i have a snowballs chance in hell to get this ticket LOWERED? not trying to get it dismissed.    or is it a better bet to just pay it off? what options do i have to make this not make my insurance go up?

See  http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/ralph...  . Almost one month later, Alaska Democrat Senator Kim Elton [the chairman of the committee that released the "Troopergate Report," a report that falsely says Honorable Sarah Palin, "Abused Her Power"], says: "Today, I will say we got the truth.

20090304152432AAQAI2T	Politics & Government;Politics	Doing a research paper on the Stimulus Bill?	according to the answers from my last question people making 150,000 a year are considered upper class, and Obama wants to increase taxes on them.   the 1040 instruction book for doing your 2008 taxes says that married people who make between $131,450 a year and $200,300 a year have to pay $25,550 plus 28% of their income.   that means a person making exactly 150,000 a year has to pay $67,550 in taxes. that is without all of the tax cuts.   and just in case someone wants to say it will decrease dramatically, the tax table (page79 if you have the book) says that married people making exactly $100,000 a year, which is the highest the table goes) have to pay only $17,861.   So since the upper class citizen has to pay as much, if not more in taxes that the average middle class citizen actually makes in a year, why does Obama want to increase their taxes and give "poor" people tax cuts?      This is for a research paper for my AP English III class.   now that i have some facts i'd just like to hear opinions

20090304102919AAs7YC9	Politics & Government;Politics	Is Rush Limbaugh really a closet homosexual?	Political commentator, radio host, college drop-out, alleged    closet homosexual, and, as previously revealed, synthetic heroin drug addict, Rush Hudson Limbaugh III is probably the best known neocon personality in American radio.      Born in Cape Girardeau, MO, in 1951, Limbaugh spent many of his formative years pursuing a career in radio. After using his pilonidal cyst - a congenital birth defect - to avoid military service in the Vietnam War, Limbaugh briefly worked for radio stations in Pittsburgh, PA and Kansas City, MO.  Fired from both jobs, he worked as a wiener salesman for the KC Royals baseball franchise, eventually slithering back into the radio business.      In 1971 Limbaugh attended Southeastern Missouri University,    where, according to reports, he had a brief but heated affair    with Elliot Sanders.  So gay is Limbaugh, guarantees Sanders,    that, "none of his marriages was ever consummated."      Many of Limbaugh's fans staunchly deny the man's alleged    homosexuality, and Limbaugh himself says the rumors are    politically motivated lies.  However, one is forced to doubt    Limbaugh, who has a history of denying and balking at rumors    that are later revealed to be true.  His pilonidal cyst, his    pseudonymous career in Pittsburgh radio, and his addiction to    Oxycontin are all facts which Limbaugh initially denied or    concealed.      After more failed stints with Missouri radio stations Limbaugh    moved to Sacramento, CA, where he met and became "friends"    with Norm Woodruff, a flamboyant, openly gay man with a    great deal of influence in the local radio scene.  Woodruff, who     mentored Limbaugh in the ways of affluence and elitism (traits    Rush mocks today), would later died of AIDS.      Through his ties to Woodruff Limbaugh was given Morton    Downey, Jr.'s spot on KFBK News Talk 1530 a.m.  Within    twelve months Limbaugh had become the most popular radio    personality in Sacramento.  In 1988 he signed on with EFM    Media Management, working from New York City.
20090304104359AAtnzft	Politics & Government;Politics	Rush Limbaugh must be the Almighty to the Republicans. Huh?	Rush the car crash you can't help but look at.  That is the source of his high rating, a person people love to hate.  A distraction.      If Obama is the Messiah to the democrates, then Rush Limbaugh must be the Almighty to the republicans. Hey republicans you better do your talking point checks with Rush before you open your mouth or you might be apologizing the next day.  You have armored this guy even though he is not a politician, which is perfect, because he makes too much money and bring in too many people who listen to his program for the company he works for to fire him if he says anything reckless.  This speaks loudly to the republican situation.  They don't have anyone on the political stage who can give a clear agenda to the crisis we face, so they bow down to Rush to do the fear mongering and spew hate to rally the republican base, sad.      Then the old republican tactic comes to play.  Fear, hate, guns, religion and race to distract you with them wanting to lower taxes for the rich 5% of the population who for every $1000 they give to charity get back 300% more than the middle class person giving the same amount; who likes to keep minimum wages low at all times while CEOs get huge bonuses; who passed bills that allow credit card companies to increase interest at an unbelievable rate, who make sure that contract go to contractors with connections with no transparency or accountability; who would allow a large portion of the American jobs sent to poor countries; who would stay quiet for 12 months about a recession, just not to take any accountability.  Sad.  Wake up.  Education -Health care-Jobs is what is important.

20090304143606AAHgga2	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Speeding Ticket in California?	I'm currently facing charges of "speeding" going 80 in a 65 zone on the 101. The cost of this ticket is $202, not including the extra cost of having the "privilege" of paying even more money and time for traffic school itself. There is also an additional $10 charge if I make the payment online (I totally don't get this, yes, it's convenient for me to pay online so I have to be charged for that? Moreover, me paying online means I don't waste public resources going into the courthouse to pay. By most logic I should be getting $10 off for simply paying online. This actually irritates me more than the ticket itself as it's the same thing bill collectors do, which are obviously greedy, but our government? Just another example of the government trying to hold us down.)      So anyway...      I can't afford this, I'm going to school and am fighting to get my unemployment benefits back so my idea is to get an extension followed by a Trial By Declaration (I send in a letter pleading not guilty) and then if that fails go into court or suffer my loses.       Any thoughts? My main concern right now is the extension voiding out my option of a TBD and then the TBD ruling out my option of traffic school. Can anyone confirm or put this concern to rest?       Any advice would be much appreciated too, what to say on the TBD or other ideas on how to handle this as I not only cannot afford this (I've been using the same cell phone for five years that is broke, can barely make calls anymore, and eating 22 cent ramen packs with my last 4 semesters of school unpaid and can't even afford books this semester, but yeah, the government is still aiming to rob me, most upsetting is the government robbing me of my time and money through jury duty and now they're doing the same only money being their primary focus now).

I am active duty AF and am most likely getting out under General Under Honorable Conditions after almost four years.  I love the military.. and I have always had a thirst for experiences I perceive the Army as having more of than the Air Force.  I am not knocking my AF at all.  They gave me a place to sleep, fed me, paid me and I met my wife here at my duty station.      However, I am asking this because I want to hear what other people have to say about it outside of a recruiting office.      I've looked at pros and cons.  The military will provide me a check and take care of my family, and I believe I'll have options to do what I've wanted to do since I was a kid that I still want to do now (to be more 'in the fight').  I know marriage life will be hard while I am in.  My wife understands this and is supportive as well.  I know they work things differently, deal with things differently, and have a different mission and longer deployments.      Before I rant some more... I'll leave it at that.  I've made some mistakes in the AF that have been administratively resolved through non-judicial punishment, and it's my fault I got to where I am, however I learned a lot about myself, people, the military and gained some good training and can say I've served my country even though I never had the opportunity to deploy.      Okay, any opinions appreciated.  Thank you.      Reuben Ingram, A1C, USAF

Why is consumer confidence still falling?

20090304105329AAhc6TM	Politics & Government;Government	How long will it take for Obama to take responsibilty for what is happening?	For the liberals that answer this spare the BS about Bush he inherited a recession (fact) he had 911 happen at the beginning of his administration(fact) and here is a factual assessment of his 8 years      This is from the wall street journal this morning.      PRESIDENT BUSH HAS A GOOD ECONOMIC RECORD   The evidence shows that much of the Democratic Party's criticism of President Bush's economic record is wide of the mark, says Keith Marsden, a fellow of the Centre for Policy Studies.      How does the performance of the U.S. economy really compare with other advanced economies over the eight years of George Bush's presidency? Data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the International Comparison Program (ICP) (a cooperative venture coordinated by the World Bank) and the U.S. Census Bureau allow a nonpartisan, factual assessment, says Marsden.       Economic growth:      U.S. output has expanded faster than in most advanced economies since 2000.    The IMF reports that real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent over the period 2001-2008 (including its forecast for the current year).    President Bush will leave his successor an economy 19 percent larger than the one he inherited from President Clinton.    This U.S. expansion compares with 14 percent by France, 13 percent by Japan and just 8 percent by Italy and Germany over the same period.   The latest ICP findings, published by the World Bank in its World Development Indicators 2008, also show that GDP per capita in the United States reached $41,813 (in purchasing power parity dollars) in 2005; this was a third higher than the United Kingdom's, 37 percent above Germany's and 38 percent more than Japan's.   Household consumption:      The ICP study found that the average per-capita consumption of the U.S. population (citizens and illegal immigrants combined) was second only to Luxembourg's, out of 146 countries covered in 2005.    The U.S. average was $32,045; this was well above the levels in the UK ($25,155), Canada ($23,526), France ($23,027) and Germany ($21,742). China stood at $1,751.

20090304115155AA63F8r	Politics & Government;Politics	Why doesn't Obama get credit for holding this mess together?	He helped AIG and the financial institutions.      If they had failed, do you realize how much money the government would have to dish out to everyone via the FDIC.  Anyone who had a bank account would have to get paid, causing much more debt than the 787 billion that he requested.      If AIG failed, then everyones 401K would be gone, completely.  You complain about it losing 40% of its value.  How about losing 100% of its value because AIG went belly up.      No one would get any loans because there would be no bank.   The USA would be tens of trillions of dollars in debt, just from the 100,000 dollars that FDIC insures on bank accounts, since every bank would have gone bust.       Corporations would flee the USA like rats from a wildfire.      Instead, Obama has instituted a stimulus that has already created jobs, saved jobs, and is on track to create millions more. Obama has taken steps to stabilize the market.      Question:  Why don't you give Obama credit for all the good things he is doing?
20090304120211AACfcNh	Politics & Government;Politics	Does anyone really understand the disaster that Obama saved us from?	AIG goes under => no more 401K's, all retirement 401K's lose 100% of their value.   Banks go under => FDIC is forced to pay trillions to people who had checking, savings, and money market accounts with the banks, leading to a budget deficit that makes the 787 billion stimulus look like a drop in the ocean.      No banks and no insurance leads to every multinational corporation to flee the US market. Corporations that cannot leave, cease to operate due to no financing from any bank, or are absorbed and bought by Chinese corporations.      No corporations means that GDP drops like a lead weight in a fish tank, No GDP means no tax revenue which means record unemployment and even less tax revenue. This leads to foreign countries buying up pieces of America to try and collect on the debt they have been buying for the last 30 years.      OBAMA'S POLICIES AVERTED ALL OF THIS!! Yet you want him to fail?      So:      Q: Do you understand the crisis that Obama saved the USA from?   and   Are you grateful for it, or do you hate him for it?

20090304124430AAvrNXE	Politics & Government;Politics	Igor Panarin says that America will collapse next year.  Your thoughts?	Edit:  Igor Panarin is a "dean" at the Foreign Ministry's school for future diplomats and a regular on Russia's state-guided TV channels.      Panarin argued that Americans are in moral decline, saying their great psychological stress is evident from school shootings, the size of the prison population and the number of gay men.      Turning to economic woes, he cited the slide in major stock indexes, the decline in U.S. gross domestic product and Washington's bailout of banking giant Citigroup as evidence that American dominance of global markets has collapsed.      "I was there recently and things are far from good," he said. "What's happened is the collapse of the American dream."      Panarin insisted he didn't wish for a U.S. collapse, but he predicted Russia and China would emerge from the economic turmoil stronger and said the two nations should work together, even to create a new currency to replace the U.S. dollar.      Asked for comment on how the Foreign Ministry views Panarin's theories, a spokesman said all questions had to be submitted in writing and no answers were likely before Wednesday.      It wasn't clear how persuasive the 20-minute lecture was. One instructor asked Panarin whether his predictions more accurately describe Russia, which is undergoing its worst economic crisis in a decade as well as a demographic collapse that has led some scholars to predict the country's demise.      Panarin dismissed that idea: "The collapse of Russia will not occur."      But Alexei Malashenko, a scholar-in-residence at the Carnegie Moscow Center who did not attend the lecture, sided with the skeptical instructor, saying Russia is the country that is on the verge of disintegration.      "I can't imagine at all how the United States could ever fall apart," Malashenko told the AP.

As long as Republicans keep standing against legislation to help people keep their homes and their life savings, the only people that will support them are die-hard Republicans. Not enough to win an election. Your big government argument works in times of prosperity, but when times are tough, people do not want to be told that they are on their own. Keep it up.

A footnote, the all knowing Obama has pulled a smoke and mirror on his minions, simple even for them to comprehend, Obama gives back the right to keep a whole 13.00 a week for married couples, then gets back three times the amount in the taxes that will happen under the cap and trade ploy,when the utility companies pass on their higher costs to the public, then lets the Bush tax CUTS expire, a three shot punch in their pockets and they don't even grasp it.

If his budget is passed, and you include the stimulus plan, he has increased the annual government spending by over 40%.  That poses another question.

20090304135144AAmSA3Y	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is Obama giving millions to those who could not afford their houses to begin with?	It is obvious that at least 3 million of the 9 million home owners Obama wants to bail out could not afford the homes to begin with and will never be able to do so. This by all common sense and reality is a total waste and such funds should go to assist honest working people who can barely make it but are busting butt to do it. This has to be nothing more than a political rip off move, and to save the corrupt bankers who allowed it to happen to begin with.

I am hearing that Biden is at that plush resort in Florida that costs $400-$1,000 dollars a night (where the AFL-CIO bosses have been reported to be meeting at)  What I hear is that Biden is meeting with the AFL-CIO on how to push thought the card-check union bill through Congress as fast as possible (before you notice it happened). That's the bill that will force open ballots when employees vote as to whether or not to accept Union representation.      What do you think of the bill?   What do you think of Biden meeting "secretly" with the AFL-CIO? (I don't have confirmation of this-but this is believed to be happening)   Doesn't look like an "open" government does it?

We all know that the current health care system has flaws.    People can not afford the medicine that they can not live without.

Every other industrialized Nation on earth has Universal Health Care, with the U.S. being the exception.

What is the reward for working your entire life, trying to save what you can, pay mortgage and bills on time, make responsible decisions on what house to buy and loan to get. I have a feeling my reward will be "Sorry, you make to much money for your daughter to get any financial aid to go to college, even though her grades were excellent. In her place, we will send a person whose parents do not work, receives Medicaid and whose grades are not as good as your daughter, and the parents have never paid taxes. It is because this other person has been "disadvantaged".       Sounds idiotic, but in order to make sure my daughter gets a good education in college, I need to quit working and get on public assistance, then she will be "disadvantaged" now, but maybe not later.      So tell me, what is the reward I get for working and being responsible, when the system is set up to help the exact opposite?

20090227075344AA4lCYX	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What is the Statute of Limitations, and how does it work in Court?	I am wondering about what exactly is the Statute of Limitations. My understanding is that it attaches to a criminal case the same as Jeopardy, and starts from the day a case was entered.... That there is a certain amount of time for the State to prosecute the case before it basically Expires because the Statute of Limitations in which to -bring- prosecution has expired?      It is also my understanding that the State has a right to enforce its Prosecution against an individual, during the Statute but not after, and after which is grounds for Dismissal since the State did not meet its burden of proof. (Arrested after the Statute, maybe, on an unresolved case or computer remnant, but not Prosecuted once it gets to the day in Court.)      Im asking more specifically to Municipal court application, as I am also aware that Felonies and High-Court cases (some cases that should go straight to Remand or Special Remand, same thing, do not) but my question is about Low CCourt charges, and i seek a better understanding if how the Legal concept of Statute of Limitation works, and its application to Court.      Most of the time the Prosecutors do not even know, so I am seeking to educate myself on this. Thank You.

Liberal translation: Only the tax cuts for those over 250K will expire. WRONG! Unless Obama actually extends the under 250K tax cuts they will expire in 2010 also.    Why is Obama so careful to not say he will extend them?    Maybe because he never planned to?      Pick the most popular "Obama Supporter" answer for this question      1.

20090304132357AAe3k8p	Politics & Government;Government	Why is the Congress government in India not serious about tackling the population explosion?	The Congress government is not serious about the education and upliftment of women. Once those two happen birth rates fall down automatically. Why is the Congress more interested in the muslim votes which the mullahs get them enblock? In return the government lets them radicalise Islamic population to reproduce more and more to overtake India Demographically. The birth rates amongst muslims is much higher and now Hindu groups are asking Hindus to reproduce more, lest India become an Islamic state. Nobody is willing to tackle the problem across the board irrespective of religion. Do these so called secular parties have a vision for India or are they only interested in their votebanks and petty politics?      Things will only change if we have a uniform civil code, compulsory education and an end to pseudo secularism.

The reality is that the economic conditions are horrible and getting worse and there isn't much hope for a quick recovery.  Should the president always focus on the positives are should he be honest and direct?  To me, a president loses credibility if he's too upbeat.  The obvious example was when Bush claimed everything was going well in Iraq.  Americans stopped trusting him and he quickly became a powerless lame duck.

My end goal is an SA position in the FBI, and while I understand the requirements to get in, I'm just wondering if an MA will help my chances and if so, in what discipline?      I'm a 24 year old female with a BA in physical anthropology (with extensive research in skeletal osteology and forensics).  I graduated from Ohio State with a 3.3 GPA.  I'm also a veteran with about 2 and a half years of experience in military intelligence to include a 15 month deployment.  I also have about 3 more years left, again in the MI field, and I will separate as an 0-3 (captain).  I've got the clearance, I've kept my nose clean, etc.  Also have no problems passing any FBI physical fitness requirements.      I know because of my experience as an intelligence analyst, I could do the FBI IA think but I would really rather do the SA track.      Additionally, I'm also a single parent (or I will be here in September) and I'm not sure how that would play in... I know the military hassles me from time to time being a single parent.      Anyway, I just want to know if I am on the right track - this has been my dream for about 15 years and I've worked pretty hard to get there despite many, many road bumps.      Thank you!

20090304132833AABLnhh	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Legal Advice, Bar Fight?	Sorry it’s long but please help…      On New Years Eve my fiance and I were at a bar and we were leaving. As we were leaving a fight broke out and I asked what was going on, as we discussed it a very large woman spun around and started pushing my fiance. (she was friends with the person in the fight)      I grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the bar to avoid any drama and we awaited for our DD out front. About five minutes later the woman stormed out the front door, HIGHLY intoxicated.      She proceeded to get in both our faces yelling and cussing and pushing again. Before I knew it a punch landed right on my face and split my lip wide open. I fell to the ground and my fiancé bent over to check on me. To which the woman then hit him in the back of the head and proceeded to punch him two more times.       At this time because this woman was literally 75 lbs heavier then my fiancé he had no choice but to swing back, after telling her repeatedly to stop. From blocking her punches he had bruises up and down his arms.       In the next few minutes there were punches thrown and when someone yelled “the cops are coming” everyone ran to their cars. With it being New Years Eve and everything we blew it off as a stupid fight, especially since this woman started and caused the whole thing.      Now two months later we are being informed by a detective that she is pressing charges because in the fight she rec’d a broken jaw. How that happened I do not know, there were no weapons used and the fight was over so quickly I didn’t see any blows that could have caused that extent of damage.      We are in the state of Ohio, what charges would be filed on this and what penalties is he looking at? Also isn’t there a way to beat this when we do have a witness along with I also being a witness. We are also both filing charges on her for the punches she threw but I need some advice please.      Additional info:       he has a record, from about 8 years ago but he does have a record.       unfortunately the bar people were attending to the inside fight and saw NOTHING of outside. Our witness is a friend and she has no witnesses.       Also attourney wants at least $1,000 and I don't have that kind of money.      I believe she is pursuing it to get her med bills paid, but we don't have that either. he is out of work at this time due to ACL replacement.

Hello      My grandmother passed away recently, leaving her home which was purchased in trust by her 4 children some years ago. The equity from the house was to be shared equally by the 4 on her death.       One of the 4 passed away some years ago, leaving his estate to his wife, of which the wife is now claiming his 1/4th share. Is the wife entitled to his share of the grandmothers house equity? Or does the fact that he died beforehand invalidate his wife's claim?      Many thanks!

20090304152556AACdeL0	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	DUI sentencing. is this justice?	Nick hogan got in drunk driving accident and turned his friend into a vegetable. He was going 100 mph in a 40 mile zone. He was underaged AND he already had 5+ speeding tickets prior, in which e was traveling up to 115 mph. He was sentenced to 8 months in prison, with an early release (A side note, since this was after the trial, it's too late but the tape recordings of his conversations with his dad released from the prison show that he has little or no remorse.)      If you drunk drive and accidentally kill someone, you get a maximum of 5 years. Looking up "drunk driving sentence" on yahoo news, it seems like the average sentence is about 1-2 year and some are sentenced to probation or even slapped a fine.      So you become a killer and only get a year or two...      A high school hacker (obviously of great intelligence) hacks into his school and changes his grades. He gets almost 30 years in prison.         Im guessing changing your grade is much worse than killing someone.    What are your thoughts?      (Btw, if i were that student, I would've said to the judge "I wish I was convicted of drunk driving instead, and had accidentally ran over your son!")

The only thing thats holding me back, is the alternative school i'm going to does'nt allow you to enroll during the middle of school years...so i have to wait til next school year (August) to start back...so i talked to my guidence councilor, and she said i would have to stay in high school for another 3 years, to make up all the credits i dont have..and by the time the new school year comes around, i'll be 20 when i graduate...a month shy from 21   Do you think it's worth staying in high school to get my diploma until i'm, maybe 20 years old?   I'm stuck..and i really need some opinions   Thanks for your help..
20090304151705AAWxlEA	Politics & Government;Elections	Isn't the problem with the entire government rather than just one party?	We're stuck with the government and evidently giving them more power for them to control us all even more, like slaves in a developed world. Yet they give everyone this idea that one party will be better for the country and people are constantly bickering but surely the problem is with ALL of them. All presidents and prime ministers have left one significant problem or change that has only worsened situations or given the government more power, so why bicker with each other? Why not just go against them completely?   Not saying people should behave like rebellious teens but they should be able to see past what the government want them to see. They are all for the same agenda, so is this two party system nonsense just a tactic for them to succeed in whatever this agenda is?      I know some will mistake this for a rant, I admit I am going on a bit but I am genuinely looking for your own opinions on this too. Thanks :)

This has surpassed Iraq. Is anyone else greatly troubled?      Nancy Pelosi on Fiscal Responsibility:      "Our federal budget should be a statement of our national values. One of those values is responsibility. Working with President Barack Obama, Democrats in Congress are ending the Bush Administration's irresponsible budget policies that have produced historic deficits. Instead of piling trillions of dollars of debt onto our children and grandchildren, we have restored Pay-As-You-Go budget discipline, adopted fiscally responsible budgets, and worked to stop waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted."

20090304150347AALVFwJ	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think about Rush Limbaugh's latest speech, and why?	Until he gave his speech the other night, I had no problem with him. Yes, I'm a democrat, but I thought he was entitled to his opinions, just like the rest of us. When he first said "I hope the president fails," I didn't think much of it, yes I did think it was messed up that he said that, but it was still his opinion.      However after watching that speech he gave, I absolutely despise him. All he's doing is inspiring hate! I looked at the fat pig (really hate him) blathering on about WHY he wants the president to fail, but instead of just keeping it about that, he just went on and on about every little thing that didn't agree with him (liberals, democrats, just about everything that came into his head at the time...), and it got to the point where it was as if a conspiracy theorist got up there and said "Obama's gonna turn us all socialist!!!!."       I mean I don't want to say it, but it was so damn similar to Hilter addressing Germany that it made me steaming mad. I'm not saying republicans are nazis, but all that came out of his mouth was spit and hate, and now he's made every republican that gets interviewed a "nazi." If you don't agree with him, and you've said so publically, days after saying so you'll be "persuaded" into withdrawing your statements, realizing how wrong you were. Now every single other conservative radio talk show host agrees with him. Yeah, sure you do. Bunch of hate-mongering sheep...      I don't know, it just makes me sick to my stomach... but feel free to enlighten me on the subject...

20090304153355AAc6YBd	Politics & Government;Politics	Question about Obama's Stimulus plan?	according to the answers from my last question people making 150,000 a year are considered upper class, and Obama wants to increase taxes on them.   the 1040 instruction book for doing your 2008 taxes says that married people who make between $131,450 a year and $200,300 a year have to pay $25,550 plus 28% of their income.   that means a person making exactly 150,000 a year has to pay $67,550 in taxes. that is without all of the tax cuts.   and just in case someone wants to say it will decrease dramatically, the tax table (page79 if you have the book) says that married people making exactly $100,000 a year, which is the highest the table goes) have to pay only $17,861.   So since the upper class citizen has to pay as much, if not more in taxes that the average middle class citizen actually makes in a year, why does Obama want to increase their taxes and give "poor" people tax cuts?      This is for a research paper for my AP English III class.   now that i have some facts i'd just like to hear opinions

At my high school one of our assistant principles keeps giving this gay couple Saturday detentions for things just like holding hands or hugging not even kissing.  Now the way I understand it this is illegal because he would have to treat strait couples the same way if they were doing these things but he does not because I have walked by blatently kissing my girlfriend and I know he has noticed.  My question is am I insane or is this a very severe discrimination case?

20090304150030AAMUFtK	Politics & Government;Military	Temporary Additional Orders for the USMC?	Well, I got a very brief phone call from the hubs today. He got his "temporary additional duty orders" to go to Afghanistan. The way he explained it is he's not being stop-lossed, and he's not getting a forced extension, but he must stay with his unit (that's deploying to Afghanistan in July). To me that's a round about way of saying he's going. He said unless they get enough new Marines to replace the ones leaving the USMC, he's going. Does that mean new recruits, new Marines through this training, what? He didn't have time to explain what that meant. Also, any idea what the chances are of getting new Marines or is there no way to predict that?
20090304150235AAoWtub	Politics & Government;Military	I met someone before Basic, how do I get back FAST?	I'm leaving for Army basic training at Ft. Leonard Wood on the 27th and then AIT for 17 weeks at Ft. Sam Houston. Since my MOS is a 68W (Medical Specialist/Combat Medic) and I'm a male, more than likely I'll be sent overseas which is where I wanted to go in the first place. It is important to me to be out there saving lives and being an encouragement to people who are in a bad place. The problem is, I met someone very special and I need to know how I can finish my tour as fast as possible and find a state-side post for the duration of my 4-year commitment. How do tour rotations work? Could I change my MOS after my first tour? Can I request a transfer to a state-side hospital after a year? Does volunteering for dangerous missions, getting shot, earning medals etc get me rotated back faster? She lives in Boise, ID. How do I get back there as fast as possible? I'll do whatever it takes. Thank you so much for your help!

20090304150505AAFnXAc	Politics & Government;Politics	How is election is conducted in USA and in what way it is different from Indian process?	May I suggest some preventive steps to ensure free and fair election?      There should be complete prohibition in the country after the announcement of election till its declaration of result. Would it not help in minimizing crime during the election?      Distribution of any material, gifts, cash or even farm products among voters during campaign or otherwise should be banned and if any candidate found to be indulged in such activities directly or through his supporters, his candidature must be cancelled spontaneously.      Why does a good candidate need support of India fame political leader or a film actor or a few singer or dancer to win the election? Why not these rallys should be banned?      None of person outside the state or even outside the constituency should be allowed to file nomination in the election. None from outside the constituency should be allowed to campaign for any candidate.      Use of public transport or vehicle to mobilize audience in the political rally should be completely stopped after announcement of electoral dates      Any candidate should not be allowed to address a rally of people more than 500. This will force candidate to go to each mohalla and speak to voters more closely.      Caste based gathering or meeting should be completely banned and if possible even title of the candidate should be removed in all papers and documents.      One and only one car authorized by electoral officer for a candidate should be used for campaigning to minimize seizure of private cars by musclemen of party candidates. In constituencies with bigger area, number of vehicles to be used in the election may be two or three, maximum upto five. But registration number of all such cars must be quoted in nomination papers and the cars approved by the concerned electoral officer should boldly paste the same on the front glass of car.      List of political workers, polling agents and personal security guards must be given to district magistrate within three days of acceptance of nomination to avoid use of muslemen, booth capturer and criminals in the election.      Government should ban completely display of all types of arms including lathi, knives, kripals, trisuls, arrow etc from the date of finalization of candidature till declaration of result of the election.      All print and TV media should submit list of reporter or journalists or photographer to district magistrate within 24 hours of finalization of list of election candidates to avoid criminals working in disguise of press man or TV personnel.      Suppose criminals or terrorists are moving openly wearing dress of police or CRPF or BSF during election times or even in general days. Is there any check point in the hand of administrator? And if yes, are they conducting random checking?      Person with criminal record should be advised to surrender at least during election days and political party should be allowed to submit additional list or objects to police list. Disputed figure may be revisited by SP of other area.      Use of fire crackers, loud speakers, band parties, archestra, singer & dancer for election campaign should be completely banned.      Candidates should give list of promises made by him during election campaign to electoral officer on everyday in the evening .Candidate should declare before magistrate on oath that he will put such promises in action  failing which his election may be cancelled and fresh election may be conducted. However a sitting candidate may be allowed to submit his report card on work done by him during his present or last tenure.      All political party of national level or regional level should focus on quality of candidate and not on caste or community or winning ability of candidate. If political parties avoid giving ticket to person of criminal record, good people will enter into Parliament and they will focus on business.      Should electoral officer also collect report on candidate from police, administration (district magistrate) and if possible local prominent social bodies or group of bodies including factual NGOs and if adverse report is found, the candidature should be rejected to nip in the bud.      Armed forces or other personnel on duty for election must be fully utilized, more specially in sensitive areas; daily report of their duty must be given to electoral officer.      Lastly all winning candidate should be instructed to submit performance report every month to District magistrate or CM or any appropriate authority who in turn will verify the correctness  of  performance shown by him and if found false , he should be empowered to award punitive action.

I went to a bar that has these big steep wooden stairs that you have to walk up and down to get in or out of the bar. While I was walking down them someone had dropped ice cubes on the stairs. I stepped on one and slipped which caused me to damage three Ligaments from my foot becoming dislocated. I popped it back in and informed the door guy. He told me the hospital was 15 blocks north and told me to get walking. I asked him to go get my friend from inside but he told me that he could not leave the door. It is badly bruised, cannot have weight on it, cannot move and it will take no less than 2 months to heal. Their is a chance that I may have destroyed some of my cartilage also. Which will cause me to have early arthritis in my ankle. I do not have health insurance and my first doctors bill is about $650 and the next one will be about $1200 for tests.

I had two accounts one where I worked and another at another bank. I was having problems with my mortgage. I was able to negotiate a modification but they told me I had to pay the pending property taxes. I knew I was going to be recieving a tax refund in 8 days. I knowingly wrote a bad check. Days later I get taken to an office and they drill me about the check. I'm let go. They tell me I have to pay the money back. I sent them two postal checks. Along with a letter letting them know that I would be making five payment installments towards the account. I checked on my account and they haven't given me credit. A co-worker says they want the full amount. I'm still being charged fees. Normally when customers overdraw thier account, they are able to make small deposits to thier account without the continuation of fees as long as they don't miss an agreed payment. I desperatly need some help in how to deal with this Bank of America corporation. I'm getting nowhere on my own and my savings can only handle a month of mortgage. Looking for a job and dealing with this is stressing me out.

The latest ruling by the Supreme Court was in regard to a woman who lost her arm because of a drug that was inadequately labeled.      Three of the Four Conservatives (Alito, Scalia, Roberts) dissented and stated that it was up to the FDA, not the jury, to decide if the label was adequate.      The idea that all that drug companies have to do is buy out the FDA to isolate them from the fundamentals of justice is bizarre to me.  They actually believe that the drug company should continue to sell its product even though they know that it is unsafe and use the FDA as an excuse as to why.  They claim that they couldn't change the label without FDA approval...I say stop selling the product until then...obvious logic???      How can people who make it all the way to the Supreme Court really be so foolish.  They seem to have no sense of reality.      Knowledgable Opinions Only Please.

So since the upper class citizen has to pay as much, if not more in taxes that the average middle class citizen actually makes in a year, why does Obama want to increase their taxes and give "poor" people tax cuts?

Those of you who are from UK or those who know about our system.      Personally, I struggle to believe any government body will make a blind bit of difference. I mean, we had Tony Blair, he ****** up our country, then we all thought Gordon Brown would improve it... He ****** it up even more.      Then we have the next election, if you look throughout history, all the parties ever do is lie their way into power, then do bugger all bar reject everything they previously said they'd do... Then make more taxes. Joy.      Personally, I think they should rip the whole parliament down and start over.. Something different, something that is a bit more.. ACTUAL democracy. I mean, we have a choice in our Prime Minister (if it isn't fixed...), but after that, we get no real insight.      So what do you think should happen?

I have never known anyone in the military, so I have some questions. I want all honest answers, please.      1. What's the longest possible time he would be deployed?      2. What happens to me, if I live near/on base if he is deployed?      3.  Is there any way we would be able to communicate while he's gone?       4. How long is boot camp?      Thanks for all the help!
20090304153725AAg6blB	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Why can we bring back our jobs from over sea we in the USA are better off with the pollution?	We are better off with the waste and  pollution from production jobs.  Don't believe it look at our major production cities look nice but home loss, divorce,  depression, suicide, dis pair, crimes is at a all time high. I would like to have a job and poor health if that is what it takes.  We still have the road and railways to do the job but we need the factories. we can offer the company a 50% deduction in taxes. and trade an Eye for an eye world wide.  you buy from us we will buy from you same rules.

I was stateing to wonder when a number of solictors over the yrs had taken the case and when u ask questions they would say they be getting on to it....does my daughter still have a chance for sueing and does anyone know a dam good lawyer in Darwin as we live in Brisbane....

20090304154109AABaXTw	Politics & Government;Military	Have a wife and 3-year old child, and I'm thinking about joining the Navy?	With the way the economy is, I've been considering joining the Navy. The salary would be a boost, plus with the housing and medical benefits, not too mention tuition as well (I've only had 2 years in college due to problems with tuition), it'd really be a great help to all three of us.      That being said, I'm curious as to how long you tend to be overseas. I'm interested in being one of the journalists/videographers on board, so I don't know if I'd be primarily on a ship (probably, it is the Navy I suppose) or stationed somewhere closer to home.      Also, how's the boot camp? I could use a little boost in the swimming department, in all honesty I usually avoid pools or the beach. Also, if it involves any sort of scuba training, I may be out of luck. Not too comfortable with that.       I'm just curious as to how much I'm going to be able to see my family and what kind of commitment I'm looking at if I go through with this decision.
