mTwn8p79aa	There is no recommended maintenance until 150,000 miles.  At that time it only requires inspection, not necessarily replacement.|`|HlozHgwIaa	P0340 is a camshaft position sensor circuit. Are they sure it jumped time? Could be a short in the wiring, a problem with the PCM, or a bad sensor.|`|UWhk7ioraa	I would get a second opinion.<br>  Yes you would need to pull a lot of the front of the engine apart to get to the Timing Chain.<br>  You will find the Timing Chain is behind the covers that almost go from top to bottom of the engine on the end opposite the gearbox ( almost directly under oil filler cap ).<br>  I am looking at the Mazda 6 Factory parts catalogue at the moment and it says that the Timing Belt has its own adjuster. It does not matter if you have the 1.8L, 2.0L or 2.3L engine although if you have the 2.3L engine, it will have variable valve timing. None of these chains should need adjusting as the adjuster looks to be the hydraulic "self adjusting" type.<br>  Again, I would advise you to get another opinion. I have been in the Automotive Service & Repair business for 18 years now and firmly believe this type of Timing Chain set up is NOT manually adjustable. I have heard of these chains skipping or coming off but NEVER needing adjustment.<br>  All timing chains and belts have a life span set by the manufacturer, which vary depending on the car. You can check in your Service Manual or by calling your local Mazda Dealer what the life of your Timing Chain is. If yours is past it, have it changed but do some calling around first to get the best quote on both parts and labour.<br>  <br>  Hope you get the problem sorted.|`|iwVUl4Jkaa	not to familure with the mazda 6, but im assuming its behind the water pump and in the front right or left side of the valve cover, and you dont "adjust" a timming chain, you replace it and its not gonna be cheap.|`|2x5t9c82aa	Why you want to replaces your timing belt on a 2004 cars?

dJXtHRkhaa	Typically the car allows you to reprogram by simply following a few steps (for example, you put the key in the ignition, turn it to the first or second position, and then press one of the buttons on the key.)

AA11038496	If your belt is "SCREAMING", I would say that it is not a pulley that must be replaced but more likely either the alt, a/c compressor, p/s pump or idler pulley, take it to a shop and have them check it out.
NeAMuXZSaa	I'm not very familiar with old American cars, but I'll give it a shot.<br>  <br>  Black exhaust = running rich.  You should be able to adjust the mixture with a turn of a screw.<br>  <br>  Idling High is probably a vacuum leak.  This would require you to replace all of the vacuum hoses in the car, probably not terribly expensive if you live in the US.<br>  <br>  Not going over 45 is peculiar - but that in itself isn't enough to diagnose it.  If there's dirt in the transmission, it could be that the gear can't engage.  Auto tranny's use very small passageways with ball bearings at the end to specify how and when to shift (or at least, it does in some Fords), and if the dirt is blocking one of the ball bearings from moving, it won't shift.|`|6YyiloYmaa	Get an oil change.

TAw0rEhsaa	ok the transfer case allows you to send power to the front differential and axle which allows the front wheels to spin in your 4 wheel drive car. test it by putting it in 4 wheel drive and see if it works. usually if you get the transmission replaced that doesn't include a transfer case.
mTwn8p79aa	Listen for clicking or grinding when you turn the wheel.  If you hit something you may have "jumped a tooth" you can tell if you did by the position of the steering wheel when you're going straight--don't get obsessed about this one, it takes a pretty severe impact directly to the wheel and is uncommon.  Problems with rack and pinion are rare.<br>  <br>  It's much more likely that you may need a new steering pump.  Characteristics are heavy steering, groaning in the system-especially when cold, leaking steering fluid.  Replacements isn't cheap, about $500 - $1000 depending on model.<br>  <br>  The answer above mine is describing a problem with the power steering pump, not rack and pinion itself.|`|iwVUl4Jkaa	if you have a hard time turnning it to one side or the other and it dosent return without you haveing to turn the steering wheel back while your rolling. its called (beleve it or not) mornning sickness.

Check the drive belt for tightness. Start the car and observe the belt but keep hands away. Look for leaks or drips. With the car running but not moving, turn to the left then right to see how stiff  is to turn the wheel.Drive the car back and forth to look for signs of fluid on the ground or wet areas caused by fluid. Drive the car normally and check the fluid level. Additives can stop or slow down minor seal leaks only.If steering is not stiff, if you are handy change the belt. It should be changed anyway if you need to change the pump.If the noise still doesn't go away see your mechanic.|`|McqiF6vUaa	If you don't fix it, when it dies it will probably burn the Serpentine belt and all your Peripherals will stop working.

Make sure you are adding 50/50 coolant/water.|`|nDO1RVwzaa	An old timer's trick for getting by with a radiator leak was to loosen the radiator cap.  That way the system never builds pressure and the leak will be much slower.  That will get you by for a few days, but I'd highly recommend changing that hose as soon as you can.  You really don't want that hanging over your head every time you head out.<br>  <br>  Changing a radiator hose yourself is a bit messy but really isn't hard to do at all.  Just be sure to keep any pets away from spilled antifreeze as it is very poisonous.|`|tNqfQo3Baa	cars are designed to operate at or above the boiling point of water. this is done by maintaining a sealed coolant system so as to keep air out. when air is exposed to coolant it will evaporate and will suck in air back into the system when it cools off (if the system is not sealed) . a water pump cannot move air. so it is possible not to have sufficient coolant flow. risk of engine damage. think about it 25 dollar hose or 1500 engine replacement. worst case of course but possible.|`|AA10498232	Trust me you don't want to find out!

AA10137828	It depends on the application.<br>  <br>  Many engines now use what is called "Torque to Yield" bolts on the heads, and other places. The best way to determine if you should replace them is to look at the factory torque specs for your engine. If it is given as: torque to xx foot pounds, and then turn an additional 90 deg, this is a torque to yield bolt, and should not be re-used.<br>  <br>  Even an engine that does not use the TTY bolts would be happier with new ones!|`|E9KyCM6baa	It'll depend on the engine...make, model of car etc.  You'd do best to find out for sure from the manufacturer or, if they aren't that expensive, then go ahead and replace them.|`|zLoWe4jkaa	Yep, what pete said.

5xxuKzXPaa	changing the head gasket will not stop that problem, however the rings and/or the valve stem seals could be at fault. every engine out there burns oil. it is part of life and nothing that can be done about it. if you are not happy wit the rate of consumption there is a few things that you can do. first off go to a little heavier oil, that is all it takes some times. also there is now an oil for this situation, the higher mileage oil can help to return the seals to there original shape and help them become more flexible again. it is not a cure all though. most manufactures agree that roughly a quart every 3000 mile is normal. if you ask me if it does not happen, at that point i would worry.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	do this first ! take the valve pans off and see if the drain holes are opened up. if they are clogged then oil can run down pass the valve seals and get on the valves. i fix a car awhile back and that what was wrong with it.|`|0945ed9f1da80c8ea7f5bc5ddae16e82aa	There are too many answers for this question.   How many quarts of oil is your wife's car using per 1000 miles of driving?   Believe it or not, 1 quart per 1000 miles is considered normal although for late model cars this is rare. If sludge is built up in the valve cover(s) over the top of the cylinder head and on some engines this can be checked by removing the oil filer cap and looking into to the filler pipe area. If you see oil (like water not draining in the bath tub), then the cylinder head drain holes are blocked and need to be opened.   The PCV system can also be blocked sucking oil under extra pressure.|`|X6C6kZKKaa	you  did not mention the make or year of car. or how many miles on it. so we would assume that the car is old. you need another car or it is time for an overhaul.|`|BOHyPgTXaa	Stop driving it.
lMIrbwifaa	HI<br>  NO its not that simple...<br>  to change Valve stem seals you have to <br>  1) pull the spark plugs<br>  2) air up the cylinder so the valve does not drop into the cylinder.<br>  3) Use a valve spring compressing tool, pull the valve spring keeper and the valve spring <br>  4) pull old seal install new one and replace springs.<br>  good luck<br>  tim<br>  |`|6xyeYjkkaa	It can be done IF you have the right tools. First you need an air compressor and an adapter so you can pressurize the cylinder through the spark plug hole. It has to be pressurized high enough to prevent the valve from dropping down when you remove the valve spring. The valve spring has to be removed to replace the valve stem seal. To remove the valve spring you need a spring compressor set up that will work with the head still on the car. Most spring compressors are designed to work with the head removed. Special tools, knowledge and safety precautions are absolutely required as the springs, if allowed to slip, can take your head off. The seals are much easier to replace with the head removed.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	it,s not that simple! if you want to change the seals then you need a compressor, a valve spring compressor to change them.|`|LTEml0Bqaa	Whilst changing the rocker(valve) cover is relatively straight forward,changing 1? valve stem oil seal is not possible without pretty extensive mechanical knowledge. One would usually change ALL valve stem oil seals. Cylinder head will have to be removed to facilitate changing seals|`|3OFxasXHaa	if you want to do it with the heads on, you need an air compressor and an on the head compressor.  you pressure up the cylender so the valve doesn't fall in and take the valve spring off and change the seals all 1 cyl at a time
AA11275863	Yes, it is very unusual for the tachometer in the car to move up and down when you turn on the truck.|`|lXIKeJQ8aa	Yes this is quite normal as the job of the tachometer is to tell you how fast the engine is running. In some areas we call it a rev counter.  |`|gp7lrUifaa	Yes, it still has a idle speed in parkfor the engine to work causing your tachometer to move. Depending on the engine, And size this will be anywhere from 700rpm - 1400rpm<br>  <br>  |`|Afmboz4aaa	yes its normal
IT6C417daa	That would indicate that your battery is losing some of it's charge over night and the alternator is working harder to charge.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	so its doing that and vibrates when stopped with ac on.<br>  I would drive it to the autoparts store and get them to test your alternator. They will do it for free. also get them to check your battery.<br>  <br>  doesnt sound like pulleys or vacuum lines.<br>  <br>  Im thinking your alt is going out.|`|9525d359baf8efc557de889ce49b8f24aa	  When you start your engine on cold days, the starter draws more power than in the summer, so the charging system stays higher than normal, or in the summer.  It has nothing to do with the belt or tensioner, unless one of them is bad.  Better  have a mechanic check them for you, as it seems, from your questions, that you aren't too well versed on car engines, etc.<br>    As for the vacuum lines---why??<br>    At any rate, best to have the mechanic check the lines, to see if you really need them changed!

sRkfnpVZaa	yes you can feel a bad idler ,far as the oil what did you put 5 gallons into? thats way to much |`|LugruY2Saa	I think an idler pulley is more of a sound than a feel thing.  If it's really bad, then yes you could feel it but I'd be thinking more along the lines of motor mounts if your engine is shaking.<br>  <br>  I don't know of anything that takes five GALLONS of oil and it street legal and uses an idler pulley.  I hope you mean quarts.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions.|`|dLHnWqDhaa	No you will not experience shaking in your vehicle if the idler pulley is bad.  I think you mean quarts instead of gallons.  If its a 5 qt system substitute 1 qt of motor oil with 1 qt of lucas.  That stuff isn't any good anyway, if it was they would mix it in with all motor oil.
QzAdWvW0aa	Yes you should compensate. You should never over fill your oil reservoir. In fact your owners manual will indicate not to over fill it. If its a very slight amount it won`t hurt anything, but very slight. |`|kTQ4dl90aa	put in only the amount of fluid the owners manual says too|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	You might want to look at this before you use Lucas in your engine:    <a href="http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/images/lucas/lucas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/images/luc...</a><br>  <br>  If you do use an oil additive (some of them are not what they claim to be and can actually harm your engine) you should subtract the amount of oil that the additive replaces.  Overfilling can cause problems.|`|lMIrbwifaa	HI <br>  WOW you had me worried at first when you said 5 gallons... <br>  I would put in 4 qts then add the lucas run the motor then check it and fill as needed. don't for get to change the oil filter or you well have a qt of dirty oil left in the motor.<br>  good luck<br>  tim

That being said, Lucas in my opinion is one of the better additive makers. They test their products beyond belief and get superb results. I build expensive race engines and use their products. I also use STP another good company. <br>  <br>  These company's that are making the additives are exceeding the governmental standards by leaps and bounds over the run of the mill oils you buy at wall mart or parts stores.

Their fuel cleaner is the only one that seems to work for me.|`|QEgpIxuKaa	For any oil, not just Lucas, always look at the testing certification labels on the container and make sure they meet the requirements for your particular vehicle.  If the correct certification  is not present or there are no certs on the label, do not buy the oil.  I prefer to stick with the major brands but some house brands, (like Wal-Mart), are made by the major suppliers and do contain the certifications.
lMIrbwifaa	HI<br>  it well take 5 qts.. don't for get to replace the oil filter as well or you well be leaving a qt of dirty oil in the motor.<br>  good luck<br>  tim|`|wpgRMjgraa	You will need 5 quarts for either engine as long as you change the oil filter as well.|`|EDumvVTcaa	Probably 5 quarts but call the dealer's service department.

You can get the belt tightened or get a new belt. If that doesn't solve the problem you may need a new pump.|`|lMIrbwifaa	HI<br>  NO the pulley is just what drives the pump and a place for the belt. It only goes bad if it gets bent or broken. All fluid well be that way after years of service.  You can change the fluid if you like.<br>  good luck<br>  tim|`|KoqoBA47aa	I would take it to a place that changes oil and have the power steering oil changed and flushed.
M8dmeAv6aa	There is a tool called a mechanic's stethoscope. It looks like what a doctor would have except it has a long probe on the end of the tubes. Start your car and put the stethoscope on your ears and probe the center of the belt tensioner  where the bolt head is, not on moving parts. You will hear it if it making noise. You can do that with you alternator,compressor etc to trouble shoot them. Just place the probe on the side of the alternator etc.<br>  Another method is to remove the belt and turn the pulleys by hand and listen for a grinding noise or to see if the pulleys turn freely.
KJeifMeOaa	It is most likely a bad connection causing a voltage drop in the starter circuit.  Most likely causes are where the cables connect to the battery and/ or the starter.  You can use a voltmeter to perform a voltage drop test at each connection. Place the test leads across each connection while someone "cranks" the starter.  If the the Volt meter shows any significant voltage, you have found your bad connection.|`|vuzi75iiaa	loose or corroded wires, check all of them and make sure they are tight.
a0de472b91f9466920bf0e18ae3d9075aa	Engine flushing is old hat. If you have changed oil at recomended intervals for your style of driving then with modern oils it should not be necessary. Stop/start use is more likely to affect the fuel injectors. add injector cleaner to your fuel.|`|d8b1889ca15ef6bd4898bac0e0e4f1ccaa	If you mean a radiator/cooling system flush, it would depend on if you have alot of rust or scale in the system,  If the truck overheats, this might indicate a need for a flush.<br>  <br>  If you mean flushing out the crankcase, you probably won't need this if the truck has had regular oil changes.  If you bought it used and don't know it's history, it can't hurt.  I like to use 3 quarts of oil and 2 quarts of diesel if the system is a 5 quart system. Get a cheapy oil filter for the flush, remove the old one and spin on the cheapy. Put in the oil and diesel. Start engine.  Don't rev the engine while you do this, just let it idle up to operating temperture then let it run for a few more minutes and then shut down and drain it hot.  Leave the drain plug out and let it sit a while to let all the oil/diesel drain out. Put the plug back in, replace the cheapy filter with a good one, add oil and you're set.|`|00b1157f788b43beca78be0761b70101aa	If you had oil and oil filters changed frequently say twice a year or every 8-10 thousand miles then there is no reason to have an oil flush.|`|1SnI86BIaa	DO NOT flush the engine<br>  DO NOT|`|c48nm70gaa	If you've been following the manufactures recommended oil change intervals home or professional engine flushes do so little they are nit needed. <br>  <br>  If you're determined to try your own flush at home products such as CRC Fast Engine Flush follow the directions on the quart can.<br>  <br>  After the flush there is another way to continue cleaning your motor as you drive. Full Synthetic motor oil has very aggressive detergents. If you'd rather not spend the money for synthetic consider the following:<br>  <br>  When you change your oil and filter substitute one quart of regular motor oil for a quart of Rislone Engine Treatment then fill to capacity with your regular oil. Rislone is a very high detergent oil additive that cleans lifters, piston ring grooves and built-up gum, varnish and sludge as you drive. If you repeat the latter suggestion enough times you'll be very supprised how clean the inside of the motor will become.
C2bBVbDGaa	It can affect allot of things. First, the shock is what holds the tire on the ground when you are moving. It stops the tire from bouncing like a basketball. It doesn't effect the overall alignment of the car, but you should notice if the car is driving different. You need to get it fixed asap. It could also cause a safe driving problem.|`|HQKTagkTaa	Shocks absorb verticale force produced while driving. They are installed as a supplement to your coil spring/a-arm suspension components to soften the impact of normal driving. Bad shocks will not normally disrupt alignment immediately, however, if driven for a substantial amount of time in bad repair, the increase in impact to all the load bearing components of that particular wheel can cause a myriad of problems including alignment. Normally, one bad shock will only show itself to the driver by way of an audible sound as the cylinder slams against the bushings. If you are a particularly sensitive driver, then you may notice a slight loss of 'tautness' or bouncing on the side of the bad shock. Most drivers only notice the noise. While it is not something that will leave you stranded on the road, it is definitely an important part of your vehicles operation and should be addressed as soon as possible to avoid any further cost due to subsequent damage.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	It might be easier if you just explained what is happening when<br>     you are driving your truck and when you notice the biggest problem.<br>  <br>     One thing,  have you recently checked your tire pressure ? Or the<br>     wear pattern of the tread..<br>  <br>     This may help a bit..|`|diDclflkaa	Yes it can. It will affect the handling, tire wear even steering. If it's bad enough it can even cause the front end to wobble depending on how it's hooked to your spindle assy. Try pushing up and down hard on the front of your truck. A good shock will travel back up and stop. If the it bounces the shock or strut is bad

Note that completely discharging a car battery like this will shave 300 charge/discharge cycles off its maximum of 1000 cycles (i.e. you'll need to replace this battery sooner eventually).<br>  <br>  If you have a relatively new car (electronic ignition, fuel injection etc.) there shouldn't be much damage to anything but the battery.<br>  <br>  If you have a relatively old car (with distributor carbutter etc.), then you've probably fried your ignition coil too - in an old Mini Minor with this kind of coil, leaving the ignition on will melt the coil within 3 minutes (according to the instruction book for the coil kit).|`|LFfEFwPbaa	if its a newer car, it may have shut itself off. make sure its in Park, or it definitely wont turn over, punch your brother in the eye.|`|kYYDOJzSaa	It shouldn't have hurt anything.<br>  <br>  You will probably have to jump-start it - or take the battery out, and autozone quick-charges them for free.

AA10524760	yeah your tranny is shot.|`|EmgiGg17aa	If this is happening in high gear (like in 3rd, 4th, 5th) then it sounds like the transmission bands need adjusting and tightening.   No biggy.  The mechanic will find it.   Otherwise, check the air cleaner and be sure that it is clean.   It could be starving for air.|`|kYYDOJzSaa	If your transmission fluid level isn't too low, then it sounds like either your transmission is broken, or the computer that controls it is messed up.<br>  <br>  Take it to a transmission shop and get a quote for fixing it.|`|RNfwo1gCaa	This is kind of what happened to my dad's car and the problem was something with the computer.. the mechanic reset it and it worked normal again.  Not sure if this is your problem but sounds similar.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	it also could be the cat. converter too. it might be plugged up.|`|2x5t9c82aa	It might be a bad sensor.|`|N6puMZ7Uaa	There was a problem with the 2003-Mazda 6. It wouldn't shift gears and would go into the (limp mode). The limp mode was designed to get you to the transmission shop at a slow (30 mph tops) speed. Sometimes resetting the computer would fix the problem. I hope this helps. Best of luck.|`|cd1HDnLTaa	It could be the pressure in the tranny too, this is also dependent on the level of fluid. You need to have a certain level of fluid not just some in there. Make sure you check the dip stick like you would when you check you oil, it helps to have the engine running when you do this. The pressure in the transmission tells it when to shift. So if you have too little fliud it doesn't know when to shift correctly, also if you have a leak in the transmission gasket it could be losing pressure.<br>  Also make sure that when or if you have to replace fluid you are using the right transmission fluid. The book that came with your car or your local dealer can tell you what type of fluid you need, don't just put any old tranny fluid in.<br>  Most important take it to a mechanic you trust, if you don't know them look up what they tell you when you get home. Or call a dealer, I know it sounds awful but mechanics can tend to assume that because you are a girl you don't know anything about cars so you will do what ever they suggest. They don't all do this but I have had a few try it, Better safe than sorry , you don't want to have to pay for lengthy repairs you don't need.

5xxuKzXPaa	unfortunately, semi metallic or ceramic pads will make noise. it is just a fact of life. there are a few things that can be done to reduce the noise. like using the proper shims or vibration reduction materials, lubricate and point of contact aside from the rotor and pads them selves, make sure that all assemblies are free from dust and other foreign material. i ran into this problem last year on a friends car. simple fix using what i have just told you. |`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	rust and dirt and type of pads squeaking is normal some what  depends on a few things but best you just take it back and see why cause really they shouldnt squeak at all but most do anyways one time or another try geting brake cleaner any parts store might fix it |`|hMCdr1zUaa	It is normal since many people have cars that squeak. BUT it is not supposed to happen. You should get them checked again. Usually what they have to do is sand them down and put some kind of grease. The vibration of the disc and the pad make that sound. Some lubricant may help. Just get them checked. It might be that the brakes they put were after market and not original. That happened to me too.|`|vFCX50DZaa	They were supposed to clean all brake components and put a small amount of grease behind the brake pads.  If any of these things weren't done, squeaking can occur.  |`|1NBBZO2xaa	Yeah, that's not unusual.  The squeaking should lessen as the pads wear in a bit more.|`|2x5t9c82aa	check your rack pinion!|`|E3t6cRdiaa	breaks squeek when they go bad but if you just had them done i wouldnt expect this especially after this long    i would say that maybe the breaks are trying to form themselves to your old rotor unless you had those changed also but not after this long i would change the rotors and break pads next time|`|0r2TSnQYaa	If it squeaks at low speeds and when they are cool then you need to seat them by going about 60 then getting on them hard not hard enough to skid but pretty hard do that about 10 times. if they squeak when they are hot then you need anti squeal behind the pads.|`|DqkRHr2vaa	you need to replace them. they are supose to squeek when they are going bad|`|qEY4Cpmaaa	ok umm.<br>  r u mising ur cat <br>  check 4 hair an blood around wheels

AA10164889	Pilot training is an individual experience, and each pilot is responsible for his or her own training.  There are no apprenticeships.  Pilots work together as crews, but all are trained professionals.<br>  <br>  In the USA, you can become a student pilot at age 16, and a private pilot at 17.  After that you can train for the Commercial Airman Certificate, which allows you to earn money for piloting services.  Most pilots also secure the Instrument, Multi-engine, and Instructor ratings at that time.  Expect to spend around $35,000 to $40,000 US to reach that point.<br>  <br>  To become an airline pilot, you will need to fly about 1,500 hours and qualify for the Air Transport Rating.  You also need a college degree.  Then you can start applying for jobs with regional carriers and air cargo operations.<br>  <br>  It is not easy to get through all this, but if you are talented and determined, you can do it.

F4FCBEgzaa	If you check the exhaust pipes and they are light grey, you have a lean condition. Because this is an older bike, you might wanna check the rubber tubes that connect the carbs to the cylinders. My guess is they are cracked and leaking air. Try spraying them with WD-40 while the bike is running and if you hear a change in engine noise - if you do, that is the problem.|`|ftELrRJraa	Sounds like a vacuum leak.  In other words too much air entering the intake system.  A died out gasket could cause this.  See if it will run better with the choke on. Having the coke on will cut off some air flow and even out the mixture.

Some bulbs are replaced by removing the top dash cover panel, some by going up under the dash, some by removing a front panel section of the dash.

E9KyCM6baa	When you start your car in the moring the exhaust system is cold.  The warm exhaust gases condesate into water as they travel down the cold exhaust pipe until the whole system warms up.  Remember seeing steam coming out of car exhausts on really cold days?  That water vapor (condensation) settles in low spots, like the muffler or before a bend in front of the rear axle, and causes rust...eventually.  A lot of mufflers are galvanized (protected against rust) or some higher end vehicles have stainless steel.  The galvanizing, like anything else, doesn't last forever though.|`|PEN3hha7aa	condensation eventually rusts them out.  i noticed a "mechanic" at a place that installed a new muffler for me punch a hole in the back side of the muffler near the bottom edge.  i was mad that they were doing that to "my muffler", but  he told me the hole was to let condensation out of the muffler so it would not rust out so fast.  whether it was smart to do or not, I took the car home and then sealed the hole in the muffler.  they thought since the muffler was lifetime replacement guarantee they had the right to do that to save money.   that muffler did rust out and i removed the seal before i had them replace it again.  they have been out of business for a while so i know they pulled more tricks than just my muffler.|`|nY6Z86aiaa	rust. and vibrations cause the pipe to move around which doesn't help.|`|AA10191024	Mufflers will eventually rust out, especially if you take a lot of very short trips. Short trips allow moisture to stay in the exhaust system and cause early failure. Longer trips dry all the h2o.<br>  <br>  You should also change oil more often if you run a lot of short trips for the same reason. Water builds up in the engine.|`|2x5t9c82aa	Maybe you hit something.

lMIrbwifaa	Hi<br>  Pot holes don't usually put holes in your tires...  The can blow them out and knock chunks out of a tire passably. If you tire is leaking air you may have a nail or a screw in your tire and you just go to a tire shop and have a flat repair. or buy a new tire.<br>  good luck<br>  tim|`|2x5t9c82aa	No you can not|`|AA11962740	If you have holes in the outer body of the tire you don't know what damage is on the inside. most tires have either steel or nylon threads inside and if these are damaged you are risking your life and others in your car and other road users. If you have hit holes that size that have caused that much damage I would change your tires and get the suspension and steering checked, you may have other damage, not worth risking your life my friend|`|Q38F4R2laa	The best way is just buy a brand new tire or a used one. But you can go to ya local gas station and buy stop leak for ya tire if its minor.  |`|16KC0aRXaa	Get them plugged at your local shop should only be 15 bucks a hole
QomVD1ceaa	I used a small staple gun. Take a marker the same color as your headliner and mark the top of the staple.|`|AA10137828	With a shop vac wand in one hand, grasp the drooping headliner and pull it out while vacuuming the crumbling foam. Where it goes under trim pieces if it is to tight to pull, cut with a razor knife. It won't bother you anymore, and you won't have the risk of poking a fallen thumbtack into your seat (yours or the car!).<br>  <br>  It actually is very inexpensive (relative term) to have one repaired. You can also search online for headliner repair kits and do it yourself. The foam backer board is not very difficult to get out.|`|zlMkBQSBaa	My cousin had this problem with her headliner in her car. I found her some plastic thumb tacks, those are made for tacking it back up as a quick fix. You just pop them through and twist. It has a screw like end on it.

AA11661950	Drain the tank  and fill with good oil. If the engine was run with the water and ant-freeze in it, you'll need to change the oil filter also, and repeat this after 100 miles.|`|j8EvotXgaa	you need to not start engine and change the oil, if you cant do it where it is, have it towed to an oil change placwe or garage and get the oil changed|`|4u8XHkxuaa	don,t start it! drain the oil pan and put new oil in it. if you started it the change the filter too.|`|2x5t9c82aa	Take it out right away!|`|dJXtHRkhaa	Don't start the engine.<br>  Try taking out all the oil and water from the engine (I assume you know where the bleed screw is, and how tto replace the engine oil). <br>  <br>  Fill the engine with fresh oil, leave it there for a while (don't start the engine) and empty it again and discard this oil. <br>  <br>  Fill it again with fresh oil, this time start the engine and let it warm up, and instantly turn off the engine when it's warm. Remove the oil while it is still warm and refill again. Use the car normally but make sure your next oil change is done earlier than usual. Hopefully by this step you'll have gotten rid of all the water and antifreeze.<br>  <br>  Explanation: All these steps were necessary because the oil needs to be warm to drain completely, but you can't start your engine if it's swimming in antifreeze, so you have to somehow drain it as much as possible while still cold, and then when you finally start up the engine it will only have a few traces of antifreeze and water. Hopefully draining it when warm will eliminate the last traces of contamination.<br>  <br>  If the above is too much for you, tow the car to a dealer or mechanic and have him fix it for you.|`|SSDS19SVaa	I agree "Drive down to your local library and get a book on it. Keep the car idling."... great advise!|`|HBodDenCaa	Laughing Out Loud.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|CwQOGJoKaa	If you are talking about your automobile,DO NOT RUN THE ENGINE.

X2ED3OrRaa	The throttle body on this car has an 'idle air' module that over time can build up 'soot and carbon 'and limit the amount or air delivered during engine idle. A spray type of carburator and choke cleaner can help loosen and remove this build up! there is no gas at this point, the only thing a throttle body controls is air [both idle and run air].Injectors controls the fuel. so clear both air passages. The big bore not so much,but the small air passage that goes past the 'baffle'. [butterfly] This port deliver air to engine at idle when the throttle is closed.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Great question, and it's also excellent that you're already looking ahead to your future.<br>  The USAF and Navy both want applicants who primarily have college majors in Engineering, Math or CS/IT.  That has nothing to do with flying per se, but the requirement to get into an officer training program.  For the academy, you should try to get as many honors/AP classes as you can handle.  Gotta keep that GPA up too.  You'll also need some extracurricular activities (I know-when I was in HS we called them "dorkxtracurricular activities): sports, student gov't, JROTC, Civil Air Patrol/Sea Cadets.<br>  In your case they don't start looking hard at your "permanent record" until 10th grade. So you've got some time.   <br>  Classes I would recommend to these ends are math, science-physics, and yes English (you need to know how to write and speak intelligently as an officer).  You might want some history as well-military history, aviation history is great to read up on.  Social Studies would be good to:  need to get/stay up to speed on current events, what the USAF/USN are doing right now; inventories etc.<br>  Stay healthy:  military flying is mentally and physically demanding.<br>  Stay outta trouble: don't let felons or drug users fly multi-million dollar aircraft.  If you can afford it, start ground school and get some flying lessons-VERY positive on a pilot training application.<br>  Most importantly, you've got a focus-stay positive work hard, don't forget to have fun in school.  We're looking for well-rounded crews: neither geeks nor jocks.|`|AGQI3NuXaa	USAFA or USNA will be your best shot. Talk to a guidance counselor about them. or use google|`|vAPCf9xMaa	I know Air Force and Navy pilot are officer which mean minimum qualification is bachelor degree, pass flight aptitude test, physical check etc before being accepted  to training.  You can call and talk to the local recruiter station for the newest updated and they will guide you to the right direction.  You can also find some flight aptitude test booklet in the local library and start study too.|`|W49o6AgGaa	In addition to the military, you can become a civilian pilot, and have a career in aviation.  You can get a private pilot's license at age 16, but could become a student pilot right away.  There is no minimum age to take a flying lesson.  Go to your local airport and check out any flight schools on the field.  You can expect to pay somewhere around $100-150 for a discovery flight, which would get you an hour in an airplane with an instructor.  It's a good idea to see if you like it.<br>  There are colleges such as Embry-Riddle and many others that offer a degree in aviation, along with the necessary flight training to get your ratings and certifications to be a commercial pilot.<br>  The military may be the way to go, but alot of people don't meet the physical requirements to get into flight school.  Just know there are many options, and you should start your research now.  Check out these websites:<br>  <br>  www.allatps.com<br>  www.deltaconnectionacademy.com<br>  www.aopa.org
O1QDrdDoaa	ok, well there are a few simple non expensive ways you could go, for your cig. lighter, the fuse is probably burnt out, jus replace that, it'll probably cost bout five or six bucks, if not, then get a fm transmitter, you could get one of amazon or ebay, not more than five bucks, and another five for S&H. thats bout it, the last option, jus buy a new cd reciever, won't cost more than forty bucks, and will have a port for your ipod.|`|MazBpI32aa	Well there is a couple of ways to go about it.. you could get a transmiter that attaches to your ipod and you just put the stereo on that channel and then it plays. But often times those dont work well and they are quite costly.<br>  <br>  Since your cigarette lighter doesnt work and you have no cassette player there really is only one other good option.<br>  <br>  Check if your stereo has a aux input. its a little hole and should be labeled aux. If it does then simply go to circuit city or best buy and get a Male to Male cable. you just plug one end in your headphone out put and the other in the stereo<br>  <br>  if it does not have an aux output then it would be well worth it to go to circuit city and buy and after market stereo for 80-100 bucks. It will sound a lot better then your old one, and should come with an aux input. It is a little pricy but like i said worth it in the end.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped.

That's easy to do when you consider most interstates have 70 mph limits. The only time an officer might give you a hard time about mileage is when it don't co-inside with your hrs. example 850 miles in 11 hrs =77.27 mph (your speeding or cheating on your log book) other than that an officer is not real concerned about the miles..|`|f826e24c244d4329e64ab8ab1b07f57faa	the most you can put in legally is 3500 a week  or 7000 if you are a team when i drove i got about 3000 to 4000 miles a week and that was only if everything was going very very smooth the rest of the time i got about 2500 to 3000 miles a week witch is what you can expect cause you dont get to many 3500 mile long trips and rarly do they have everything in order for you to do that .

If they are than it is most definatly a fuel problem. If they are not then it could be a bad coil pack. Also some cars have sensors called crank sensors as well as cam sensors which tell the engine computer where these components are so they in correctly inject fuel and ignite spark. your engine won't run with out it. Also make sure your spark plug wires are ok. If you determine it is a fuel problem check for a clogged fuel filter or faulty fuel pump. If the vehicle is getting both it is possible that it jumped time. Timing belts and chains are often negleted until they go out. Their job is to keep the pistons valves and injectors in perfect order so the vehicle will run.  Anyway hope you figure out the problem.|`|AA11756487	sounds like a pressure regulator is bad.. actually just did one this past thursday and it fixed it right up..

HUfkS4jBaa	The cutoff for the fuel nozzle at a gas station works on the principle of a vacuum. When you press the handle to pump the gas, air gets drawn into the nozzle because the fuel entering the gas tank is displacing the air that is taking up space in the tank.There is a little hole at the very end of the nozzle where the fuel comes out, and when the fuel fills to the point where the fuel in the tank covers that hole, the air being drawn into the nozzle gets cut off, vacuum is lost and the pump will cut out. So the only way for the pump to cut out is if the tank is full or something else is blocking it. My guess would be (and I'm assuming  that you're going to the same gas station every time) that the pump has an issue with this cutoff system, not the car. And the reason that it doesn't cut out when you gently push the handle is because it doesn't draw enough vacuum to run the automatic cutoff system, and the fuel will keep pumping.|`|41f6ce9d315a8c72789e8f89caa14eebaa	build up of gas fumes in the gas pump rubber nossel, try halfway inserting the pump so the gas goes in the tank or better yet pull back the black rubber covering on the nosel and try again

nB00Zd7waa	The first thing I would check is the transmission fluid. How long has it been since the filter and fluid were changed? Sometimes that will make a big difference. If that doesn't do it, take it to a reputable transmission shop to check for other problems.|`|kq08dAxqaa	if the engine and trans mounts or good, I would flush the trans and add an anti shudder additive for the torque converter clutch. one other possibility is an ignition problem, bad plugs or plug wires can cause the same sensation from a misfire under load.|`|2oWCWqG5aa	its coz there is a small problem<br>  in the transmission set <br>  just get ur car serviced<br>  and refill or change ur gear fluid<br>  i hope it will work<br>  a car is like ur friend do it soon......<br>  bye|`|e75d8a94b5fa13a12c1b19dd351ecd31aa	Trans mount broke or fluid low, or needs trans filter, if not this trans is going bad
H8g4BPy2aa	That's is technically true, they are built during the year before, but keep in mind that they have been on the road for 5 years and not 6.|`|9huP4nrAaa	car year is mostly about specs and trims. a 2002 car means it's built in 2002, has 2002 trims and so on. It doesn't even mean whoever got it got it in 2002 or 2001. say .. cruise control might be standard on a 2002 but not available on a 2001. Mostly I just look for good general conditions and mileage. If it's the same model, that is.

Also you would be able to see the statistics on weight, hp, gas milage, dimension, etc.  Then you could always go test drive one of each for a final decision.|`|gBRJ0bq3aa	I would look at the Nissan Altima.

QZ82tpNiaa	The difference between 195 and 185 is that the 185 is shorter. This is what is causing it to pull to the right. Think about it, you have a tall tire on the left and a short tire on the right, it is like a constant turn to the right.<br>  <br>  This could knock your front end even farther out of allignment than it already sounds. You really should get it put on the back so that it doesn't affect your steering in wet driving situations. <br>  <br>  Also, if the 185 tire is on the drive hub, this will affect your speedometer. Since it rotates faster than the 195, it will read a faster speed.<br>  <br>  These tire sizes are fairly inexpensive at Sam's Clubs or Wal-Mart. You could even find a good price at a Kelly Tire.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Might want to get the right size tires, and then get an alignment afterwards.  Most places won't touch your car till all tires are the same size.|`|v7nD4yWKaa	you should always run the same size tires but if you have to run 1 tire smaller than the rest you should put it on the rear of the car
mzWk9GnVaa	Well, you can go to a car customizing shop where they will give you options and install and paint the parts. Or, if you want to install and even paint the parts yourself, try finding the parts on ebay.|`|1bobsT4Kaa	you can find them online all over, but realistically be prepared to spend serious cash if you dont want a crappy job. I mean im from cali an i see alot of cars that had put kits but look horrible because a lot of these kits aren't as durable as oem bumpers. most are made with plexiglass and lots of bondo. not the best for quality. if your dead set on it best of luck,  but remember you get what you pay for.
LkU8sXuJaa	yes. many taxi companies have switched to GPS.|`|AQHXqLu2aa	Some places do not allow "hand held electronic devices" while driving. That's an effort to stop cell phone use while driving. This may fit into that category so you need to be careful while driving. If your taxi has it built-in, you're OK I guess. I think the GPS is the best thing since sliced bread for truckers and taxis.|`|t2vlrSvyaa	Yes, If i was to get one i would get a great one though, do my research and update it frequinty.  If i was a customer that got in a taxi i would love to see a GPS there.  The would save so much time plus truck drivers are using them.|`|C6hu2IbAaa	yes you can it would be a whole lot easier if you knew how to work the gps which you could figure out and you can program it to give you the shortest distance or shortest time.|`|JImUNomnaa	Use the GPS as much as possible, but I would have the map as a backup.

You?<br>  <br>  But they are starting to put GPS's in taxi cars now. Which is a good thing, it is more accurate, but sometimes doesnt work.|`|ewIELhBiaa	I would consider both as well as your knowledge of the city.

907e3984a6f4f92078cc488022d7399daa	I'd say it's a 50/50 split between people not knowing you should only use those lanes for passing slower traffic, and also the people who think that because they don't want to go 70mph+, then neither should anybody else.<br>  <br>  In both cases, its rude and annoying.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	They are ignorant prigs trying to force everyone else to slow down.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	they are new licence persons|`|XsZsk55Jaa	All of the above are correct but I think it's mainly because the police don't enforce the law.

JSjIoYjHaa	Yes, the J-10 is several generations ahead of the F-16 in terms of capabilities, it is a far superior airframe, the F-16 is quite dated by today's standards, and the avionics and other upgrades are just barely keeping it afloat, this is why the USAF is replacing them with F-35s.|`|RYDSc5Bqaa	The J-10 is turning out to be a very respectable platform. However, no matter how good it becomes it is still a generation 4 fighter on par with the current production F-15's and F-16's with all their upgrades. So, a head to head match up would come down to pilot skill and who sees who first. The only Generation 5 planes in the world right now are the F-22 and F-35.|`|u8dX8UAIaa	ive had a bit of study on the j-10 interesting to say the least,but when push comes to shove F16 but it would be down to pilot skill as well as aicraft agillity.16 getting quite old now my friend but still an amazing peice of kit|`|Msel5eAvaa	Isnt it the J-10 was the cancelled Israeli "Lavi".

The Block 60 Viper is an extremely capable air/air platform. Most importantly the J10's a prototype, which means it's flown under very controlled conditions by very skilled crews. <br>  Demo's should NEVER be taken as what a new jet can do in combat. Especially in this instance given the issues the Chinese are having with their missiles, engines and fire control systems.  Not to mention aircrew training.<br>  I would be generous and say that MAYBE the J10 would be a crude F16A model.|`|b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	I'd rather be in the Block 60 F-16.<br>  <br>  The Super Viper is a fully evolved war fighter while J-10 is still more of a prototype. It doesn't even have a final radar integrated yet. The AN/APG-80 is a mean piece of radar and combined with the ASRAAM it is a potent weapon platform. Assuming equal pilot skills I'd go for the latest refinement of the F-16 outperforming the look-alike upstart!

On a normal 4cyl engine, They should fire 1,3,2,4. But not at the same time. Unless. It is a twinspark engine. twin spark per cyl.<br>  <br>  If it is a two stroke, twin spark. It's fine. Thought they're should be a slight delay in the second, That tends to burn unburnt fuel in the cylinder. eliminating emissions (Carbon leak) and  maximum power output.<br>  <br>  So, What engine do you have? I imagine a snow mobile would have a two stroke engine. Small compact. Maybe even twin spark.<br>  <br>  |`|SrZf8Hgjaa	i have seen some other small engines 2cyl do the same thing and it was normal for them|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	I think your timing is messed up. If its a vtwin then it should be alternate. |`|OdxrtbF1aa	The spark plugs are most definitely not supposed to spark at the same time.  As each piston reaches the top of its travel compressing the fuel-air mix, the spark occurs exploding the fuel and powering the engine.  Engines all have some type of distributor that sends the spark at the right time.  The exception would be if you have a one cylinder engine with dual ignition.  Then both spark plugs fire in the same cylinder at the same time.  If you cannot determine this from the location of the plugs on the block remove the plugs and turn over the engine with a pencil or screwdriver in the spark plug hole resting on the piston.  When the piston is at the end of its travel and the pencil is pushed out the most, move the pencil to the other hole and see if it is about at the same depth.  If so, the spark is at the right time.  If not, you have a screwy problem with timing or distributor if your engine even has one.  It has nothing to do with your alternator.  On second thought, some engines may fire both spark plugs at the same time to eliminate the need for a distributor.  Only one spark does anything but the other doesn't hurt anything.  My guess is you should proceed as if nothing is wrong and the engine will run if everything else is OK.   Sorry about the first thought.
Tg5PxDnBaa	"out the door" pricing is a hard thing to ask. what is your state sales tax? What are the tags and title cost in your county?

RWjvcCYoaa	A marketing background would be helpful in making your way up to Used Car Manager. It would give you an advantage over others vying for the same position. But if you learn quickly and learn well, it may not be necessary. <br>  <br>  You'll have to start on the sales floor. Learn everything you can about sales. Show attention to every detail in a sale. Don't make your manager call you out on the carpet for not following through correctly. Be professional at all times. <br>  <br>  Then in your down time, ask your Used Car Mgr to pick out a car for you to book out. Do this as often as you can without being a pain in the butt. And pick your U/C Mgr's brain when you bring your appraisal sheet to him. Most managers love to be mentors. And they're never afraid of someone wanting to know all about their job. <br>  <br>  Once you're seasoned enough and feel confident about your skills, you can try your hand at one of the many dealers looking for a U/C Mgr. The most important thing is not to rush yourself. Be patient, learn all you can. And don't move to soon. Good luck!|`|QcENsfCEaa	College is good but in the car business it is not a needed thing. A used car sales manager need to be able to evaluate and price used cars the only way to learn that is experience. I can do a fair job of it but our used car manager can still spot paint and body work far better than I can. You have to be able to negotiate and that is something you cant learn at college. You will have to start at the bottom and work up.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	You really shouldn't skip college to get there...you never know what life will bring. A good UCM knows a lot about a lot of cars and has enough contacts to help him in every situation. That will take time. I'd suggest starting on the salesfloor, and just go from there. You need to always be honest, as your integrity will be, in the long run, what gets you the job. Also, don't hop from store to store! Nobody wants to train someone who'll just leave. Try and hit the auctions on your day off. Watch, listen and learn. You'll get there, and then wish you never did. Good luck.
LyWr0tmjaa	I bought a 2003 Civic Si that had been lowered with 17" wheels.  There are two main reasons to lower a car.<br>  1.  It makes it more aerodynamic.  Less air can get under the car which gives you a slight advantage.<br>  2.  It gives you a lower center of gravity.  This helps in high speed cornering.<br>  <br>  As far as fixes to that horrible ride you're getting, first check and make sure that they actually bought lowering springs.  A lot of kids can't afford new springs so they just cut factory ones.  If they bought new springs you can look into buying a strut bar and similar items to try to keep your frame more rigid and from tilting.  I personally got on eBay and  found springs from someone who had lowered their car to put mine back to factory. The factory has very smart engineers who take into consideration everything.  They make springs for a ride that's perfect for everyday but able to handle corners fairly quickly.  So unless you're planning on racing I'd put it back to stock height.<br>  <br>  And if you have some shake in your steering wheel, it's from the aftermarket wheels.|`|orfmhb2waa	small cars ride rough , the lowering makes it worse and so do the tires. this is why kids drive cars like this (stupid) old people drive larger cars and do not change the wheels.<br>  <br>    when i stopped buying cars based on "cool" looks , and bought a comfortable main stream "boring" sedan , i did myself a huge favor.<br>  <br>    my boring car is 100 times better than a stupid pimped civic|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Unlower it, and put factory spec wheels on. It will ride like a dream then. If you want a good handling car, buy a "sports" car.|`|mzWk9GnVaa	The rough ride is due to the lower profile tires, but mostly due to the higher spring rate (stiffer spings and shocks) of the new suspension. Stiffer suspension is necessary when a car is lowered to avoid "bottoming out" the vehicle over bumps and causing damage. The higher spring rate also improves handling. Check with the mechanic to see if the coil overs that were installed are adjustable. If so, you may be able you improve the ride quality some without giving up too much handling or the look of the lower ride height. So, if you like the look of the lower ride height and enjoy the improved handling, then the rougher ride may be worth it.|`|1bobsT4Kaa	In regards to the hit of your car, it DOES matter. Think of your center of gravity, the lower your stance the more agile you are. The ride roughness could be a various few things. The comment from earlier is correct about the profile of your tire but, you could also have bad shocks on the suspension. If they are really coilovers then you can lift them for a better ride. Hope this works out. If its your suspension an your going to change it check out this brand called function forum, honestly it rides just right to my likings. Not to stiff but just enough to feel sporty. Good luck.|`|fMS1kDA2aa	its for looks and performance. being lowered gives it a lower center of gravity and the suspension is tighter, so you get better handling and because its lowered, it probably has a bit of camber that would affect the ride quality. you could soften the suspension if you wanted to or take it into a shop and have them do it if you don't like the sporty suspension|`|VrPTLsecaa	There really isn't any advantage of having low profile tires and lowered suspension other then looks, of  which I don't even see. It's the same as fart can mufflers- all they do is sound stupid.<br>  <br>  Like they say, put the right size wheels and tires on, raise it to spec and it'll ride smoother.
AA10922071	First of all, you must have the factory radio in the car, as this is what has the receiver in it.  If you do not have the factory radio in the car, the factory installed keyless entry will not work.  After that it is easy .    You need to have the correct transmitter signal number (PCC id)  which for 2000 Honda's is A269ZUA106.  Other numbers will not work.  Most of the sellers of these key fobs know which ones will work for specific years.  <br>  <br>  The dealer charges around $70.00 for one.   I have purchased replacements on Ebay for much less.  Programming them to work is very easy with a series of turning your ignition key on and off several times while pushing the buttons on the key fob. <br>  <br>  Once you have it, you will almost never use your key.  They are great!  Good luck.|`|mzWk9GnVaa	Though keyless entry was an option on that model, yours may not have come with that option. The best thing to do is go to your local Honda dealership and give them your VIN (located on the dashboard on the driver's side, close to the windshield and on the doorpost on the driver's side). Ask them if the car was available with that option and if so, if they can order you a key. The keys usually cost well over $100 and can take a few weeks to arrive, but the option is worth it. Also, most automotive electronic shops can install an after market system, as long as you have power locks.
KQhIcU4Yaa	Most home built boats and some professionally built custom boats are made from wood with fiberglass sheathing on either side.  Factory built boats are made from fiberglass laid up into a female mold. <br>  <br>  Wood is a good material for the home builder who is only making one boat.  It is reasonably easy to shape with hand tools.  Fiberglass is applied to both sides of the wood to stiffen, strengthen and protect the wood.  Depending on the design, plywood, cedar strips, planks or balsa is commonly used for the core.   Other types of locally available wood can be substituted if the properties are suitable.  Light weight, strength, rot resistance and suitability to the fiberglass resin are desired properties.<br>  <br>  Recently, foam cores have been developed as a substitute for wood.  This allows boats to be built stronger, lighter and with better longevity than wood cores.  This is being used by professionals and home builders alike.  Some brands are kelgecell, divinycell and corecell.<br>  <br>  Other composites such as carbon fibre are becoming more common.  Honeycomb cores covered by carbon fibre skins are used for very light construction on racing boats.  These materials are harder to work with and are generally only used by professionals.  Vacuum bagging and high temperature curing techniques are used to achieve ultimate strength to weight ratios.<br>  <br>  Check out the source links below for info on most of these techniques|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	Gold. :D<br>  <br>  At least, for corrosion resistance. Not too great for building a boat, though. Seriously, stainless steel, aluminum, and fiberglass are all good.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Basically, you want plastic and stainless steel.<br>  <br>  For home building, marine grade plywood, epoxy fiberglass resin, stainless steel fittings.<br>  <br>  Marine grade plywood is basically A/B or B/B EXT douglas fir or western larch plywood with no interior voids.  A-grade veneer can have no knots or knotholes, B-grade can have knots but no knotholes.  Exterior-grade plywood, made with waterproof glue, can have Interior voids up to an inch in diameter, which increase the likelihood of eventual delamination in a marine environment.  Marine-grade is available in more exotic water-resistant woods such as occume and meranti.|`|I7NkFJo2aa	Actually Tron.Qui., Fibreglass is used commercially a lot as you don't need highly skilled workers, thats all.  And if cost was the only issue in life nobody would have anything but identical white base model three cylinder cars.<br>  <br>  The best material is the one you are familiar with - Builders like timber, engineers and mechanics like metal, performance freaks and white collar workers like plastic composites.  Artists often like ferro cement.<br>  <br>  None of the above is more than an observation, and is no more or less typical of any group in society.<br>  <br>  All materials have pros and cons.  Wood requires maintenance that many are not prepared to do, glass boats are o.k., but problems are often hidden until hideous, steel rusts - all the time - but can be treated and lasts well with care - electrolysis can be a problem, ferrocement is very good done right - but has a wretched reputation due to so many bad boats built by ill-informed amateurs, or shonky mongrels.  Combinations are often used, wood/epoxy/glass/foam etc.  Most fibreglass boats have extensive timber elements as the material is unable to do some things, this can lead to issues later if the timber ever gets wet, and fibreglass is a big sponge just waiting for a tiny crack in the gelcoat....   Alloy has some advantages such as light weight and (if not painted over!) corrosion resistance and ruggedness in commercial use, but suffers horrifically from electrolysis if any potential stray current is present - like in any marina or if you have no battery isolator switches.<br>  <br>  I like timber and epoxy, but currently own ply and traditional timber, heavy and light  fibreglass, light performance timber/epoxy, (for a short time) a ferrocement and (am negotiating currently) a steel cruiser/racer fixer upper construction boats.

69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	One of three things. It's either the solenoid, starter, both, or if the truck has ac the compressor is locked up. Try going under the truck with a screwdriver and manually tripping the solenoid. If it does the same thing the starter needs to be replaced. If it starts it's the solenoid.

Everything else can still work fine and there isn't enough to crank it over.<br>  Check the ground connection. Check to make sure that the engine to chassis ground wire is still there.<br>  Check the wire going to the starter from the ignition switch. These can come loose and cause all sorts of frustrations with no rhyme or reason to when it will work or not. <br>  Have the battery tested for a dead cell, load tested and the alternator too. Sometimes when a starter fails it develops a "dead" spot, where it works until the brushes line up with a burnt out section of the commutator. The extra juice from a boost or a charger can be enough to over come this, but leave you scratching your head why.

WPMCvrVRaa	I am 19 and was in your shoes only 2 years ago and i would say that if the Rx-8 is in your price range than stay away from it because there is most likely something wrong with it. Those cars are fairly expensive to purchase and unless you are making $12+ an hour and working 40 hours a week it will be hard to afford. Stick to something cheaper, it may not be as glorious but save your money for better things dude. Trust me, take this from someone who knows how you feel.|`|g5NAOxqAaa	Rotary engines do not get good gas mileage and oil changes are frequent, which means more expense. It seems like you want a cheaper, sporty car, so my recommendation would be a supercharged Chevy cobalt. You can pick up a 2005, with decent mileage for around 10k, and they look good!!!|`|JCaAqF1vaa	No - get a Toyota Corolla or a Honda Civic.|`|ax5PBcF1aa	The best thing you can do is look for a used Hyundai accent or some other cheap Hyundai cars. The reasons are<br>  1)The older Hyundai models had quality issues which made a bad reputation for this car. But, if u can buy cars after 2000, you will not face much problems. However, because of its bad name, you get it for cheap.<br>  I own a car which i brought for $2700 with mileage 82K<br>  2)Its gas mileage is excellent<br>  3)It runs much more than you think. you shouldn't face much problems till you drive 200K|`|mKOxr4Lwaa	it's a good car, fun to drive<br>  <br>  but probably not as a first car or a daily driver.|`|HzP6xg1Uaa	It should be impossible to afford a 2004 RX-8 with a part time job that you could easily lose.

M79W3Ct9aa	Definitely manual.  It will make you a better driver cuz you have to pay attention to driving a lot more when driving a stick.|`|8pSr5c1laa	i just got my first car last week and i would have to tell you automatic. my 2006 Audi A4 is automatic and knowing us teens we need to concentrate on the road even though we are good a multitasking so we can txt and put in a new cd but if you get a manual you will have to concentrate on shifting and pressing the clutch its to mind boggling for a first car!|`|UcXaXtrpaa	Automatic covers a big area as there are many many types of auto transmissions each differs in the way it runs and each runs different on each car.<br>  <br>  So people will usually have an overall opinion of automatics but thats all it is.<br>  <br>  Many auto's boxes also have a mix of buttons as an extra control(power button to allow rapid redline changes rev hold button snow buttons for traction control manual overdrive sports mode the list goes on) and some allow a slight manual gear change sequence on it auto box.to allow so many gears to be driven manually. <br>  <br>  Another saying is auto's are to relax in and sit back,well again this depends on the car myself have owned and riven some sporty auto boxes where the ride is a matter of keeping a constant watch on the speed as the box offers that rapid a change you have to be alert else you are well over any speed limits.<br>  <br>  So best bet is pick a particular car you want and try both transmissions.|`|KKE3lr0Iaa	I'm an old guy so my first car was a standard. I like them over an automatic (easier to work on the stick)  <br>   the standards are usually cheaper on the lots because most people want the automatic, remember and use this as a negotiating tool when looking / sneer at the standard shift cars and look at more automatics then look at the standard again and try a low ball offer, like you don't really want it. Worth a shot, remember you can always go up on an offer but not down.  Good Luck|`|vMfT2z18aa	i myself like manual but do u know how to drive one or do u have someone to teach u if not an automatic is the best way to go and if u don't want to shift all the time automatic is the way to go|`|l34etpuSaa	one thing thats great about manual is that you can start it if something like the battery dies, all you need is a push.|`|HE23qtamaa	I still don't understand why people drive manual, but whatever. I think automatic, unless you already know how to drive manual, or you think you'll need to drive a manual. All cars nowadays are being made in automatic, or that other type where you just shift up without a clutch (you know, it has + and -... Ah, I can't remember the name!). <br>  <br>  Driving manual does not make you a better driver! You can still pay attention to the road when you're driving automatic. In fact, because you have less to think about, and it's easier, you are able to better focus on what's going on around you. I think it's a million times better for city driving, where you're always stopping and starting, and there's a million things going on around you.|`|1sOWpQR2aa	I would get a manual if I could go back to my first car that way you'll know how to drive stick and then when you get all old and have a mid life crisis and want to buy a sports car you'll know how to drive stick lol.

g9lCFF31aa	Be Weary of the CL500 I purchased mine (03 CL500) and have had a Key recognition failure (EIS System) and a suspension pump failure (ABC system) both costing 2K each to fix. The BMW 7series has an amazing interior more so than the S and CL class but out of what i remember when I was looking at that was the mileage was worse but all 2 of those cars are bad with miles.<br>   In any case please get a warranty it will be worth it if a couple things go wrong which they probably will. <br>  <br>  Also try to search reviews, forums on those models, and see what problems people have had in the past, specially since they are older models, major problems have most likely been discussed.

AA11264416	well its probably paid for because it didn't have much of a payment left on it from your parents or it was already paid off when your parents gave it to you, thats probably only a 10,000 car anyways at best, plus thats not much of a car especially one to gloat about, its a boring a** car and to plain, not even anything done to it, the truck i have now i had a 13,000 plus interest loan for it back when i was 18, paid it off in about 2 years if not sooner when it was a 3 1/2 year loan and i bet my truck is still worth more than that little car because rather you know it or not cars lose value faster than a truck<br>  <br>  haha, your not fooling anybody with the amps and hydraulics, if you had a system in it then you would have took a couple pics of it to prove it has a system, also about hydraulics if it had hydraulics then the car would be lowered in the pics since it would be parked, anybody with hydraulics would have it lowered while parked or at least have 1 pic of it lowered and 1 pic stock height like it is in those pics, so nice try but not going to work sorry kid|`|QBQKxsNtaa	its a girls car sorry suv are better|`|HWlgjocBaa	its a chevy cobalt. remember the cavalier?? well, since everybody knows cavaliers were pieces of crap, they quit buying them. so chevy got rid of it, well, the exterior anyway, the cobalt IS the cavalier with a new exterior. piece of crap still. this car probably didnt cost you much, its one of the cheapest out there, and its not going to last you very long. sell it, and get a new one. <br>  still, good job by paying it off so soon, sorry you had to get such a crappy little thing.|`|eVgV3WGFaa	It looks good.

9Kt7p7Vfaa	Before you replace anything, check the fuel pressure at the end of the rail. There are plenty of reasons it wont start. There could be a mouse nest in the air box. Make sure the air system is clean, check the plugs and replace if fouled or not sparking. You could have a dirty cap and rotor and not getting spark. Squirt a spray of ether down each cylinder and put the plugs back in, tight, and crank it over. If it still doesn't start and you have spark, air and fuel, your timing might be off a tooth or the belt is loose. You'll want to replace the timing and balance shaft belts anyway. There are so many things that could be wrong, you'll need to eliminate them one by one.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Replace your fuel relay(inside fuse box).

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Honestly, I cannot believe folks here are still telling beginners to buy a 125 2 stroke. Not only is that bike far too tall for someone 5'4" but it is the worst beginners bike one the market. Also, any 250 will be too tall for you as well. You only have a couple smart options at your height and skill level. If a trail bike is all you need, a Honda CRF150F or Yamaha TT-R125LE. These bikes are very reliable, and will handle small jumps, but not a motocross track. If you want more performance (and price) the CRF150R Expert is the only real choice for you. This bike is a good bit faster than the other two and will handle anything you throw at it. It is great on a motocross track or on trails.|`|wORqCGlyaa	depending on how experienced you are i would not recommend anything over a 250cc if you are just getting started. i would go with a honda or yamaha due to their  reliability and i also would go for a four stroke ( easier on maintenance ) go to your local dealer and just ask them if you can look at some of their models and get a feel of what you want as far as weight and height and what they recommend. once you get a general idea you can keep an eye out on ebay or your local paper for something similar. since its your first bike i don't recommend buying new since after a little practice you may want to move on to bigger and better things.|`|XlhR7ooHaa	Depending on your riding experience perhaps look around the 2 stroke 125 area. By short races do you mean mucking around with you're friends? 4 strokes are the new age race bike. If so check out bikes such as the CRF 250, YZ 250F etc 4 strk race bikes<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	I recommend a yamaha tw 200 for a beginner, its road legal but it has wide tires for the off road stuff, top speed of about 60.realy affordable and very long lasting. it holds its value and is easy to learn on.center of balance is second to none.very torquey bike.and it has a bold look,,one of a kind.. look at it on yamaha.com

907e3984a6f4f92078cc488022d7399daa	As you will be keeping the car for such a long time, I'd go with the VW.  You will likely experience fewer problems as it gets older.  VW's hold their value better, but seeing as you will be selling in ten years, this really is not important, as both cars will be near enough worthless in ten years time anyway.<br>  <br>  Go for a TDI model (the 1.4TDI if you are not fussed about performance) as they are generally a bullet proof engine.|`|S4HUVnzkaa	If you are living in Eur. then get a VW.<br>  Its a good transportation car.

Hhx21tU4aa	You can use the Kelley Blue Book assessment, but I also recommend that you check Edmunds True Market Value as well.  Each will ask you to fill in all the options the vehicle has, the mileage, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm suggesting both sites because:<br>  <br>  1.  The Kelley Blue Book will give you the national average asking price for your car.  Keep in mind that this is an average asking price and is based on nationwide data.<br>  <br>  2.  Edmunds True Market Value (or TMV) will provide you with the average figure that cars similar to the one you are selling have actually sold for based on your zip code.  I feel it is the more accurate of the two.  Where the car is located is important, as it shows what people in your area are actually willing to pay for vehicles like the one you are selling.  The link I gave will take you to a page where you fill in general information. On the next page, be sure to click on the tab "Appraise your vehicle" where you can then fill in all the details for your particular car.<br>  <br>  I suggest you use both and pick a starting price you feel comfortable with, keeping in mind people will probably be making offers somewhere in between the two figures.|`|mzWk9GnVaa	Go to www.kellybluebook.com.

FSbHEEQDaa	Dear Wildthing,<br>     If a non-professional installed the new thermostat it should be visually checked again, some styles can be inverted and not function properly. Purchase a simple repair and maintenance manual for your neon at the local auto-parts store and see which way it is in the drawings for your engine type.  Of course if a bad thermostat was the original problem and your new one is inverted that will explain everything, if it is not inverted than that never was the problem so just in case lets keep thinking about this one.  You said you are not having a problem with the coolant system over-heating and you do not have to refill the radiator/fill tank at all so that means the engine is not actually over-heating. Have you considered that you may be getting a false reading? It is possible that the gauge and alarm are lying. Look in the troubleshooting guide in your brand-new manual and follow the directions showing where the engine temperature sensor is and check the wiring for damage to the insulation covering that may be allowing the conductor to contact the body. The sensor will only cost about $25, replace it if you cannot find anything else wrong.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Stuck thermostat is the first thing that springs to mind.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	It could be a lot of different things:<br>  -low coolant/air in coolant<br>  -blocked hose/passage<br>  -bad water pump<br>  -bad/corroded radiator<br>  -bad temp switch<br>  -bad temp gauge<br>  -bad rad cap|`|FedL8eKBaa	your problem is the Thermostat go to the spare parts shop and get a thermostat and ask for a 74 degrees thermostat also check your fan by pulling it in and out and if if moves in and out your Water pump needs changeing I know about this as Im a wog mobile own and I specialize in Chryslers,Dodge are 1 and the best and easy to get the power in them and if your want more power change your T.B.S with High Performance which is the Throdal Body Senser that controls your Power and economy.<br>  Hope this helped you and dont forget who knows more but people that was dealing in the Wog Chariets like me Hatzis no Im not the Wirdo but called Guido Hatzis Bye bye hope all gets better|`|mzWk9GnVaa	With the info given, it sounds like your radiator is clogged.

uzAS4OUqaa	Both the bikes are almost equal in their efficiencies.<br>  A Unicorn is a smooth bike and is very comfortable to ride. Being A Honda, it gives better mileage of around 45-50km pl, depending on how u ride. Resale value is the best in Honda.<br>  A Pulsar earlier used to be very noisy and powerful. But now, with better technology, the bike is quieter and gives a mileage of around 42-50km pl, depending on your riding conditions. Bajaj's spare parts are cheaper compared to Honda. Resale value is good too.<br>  Both bike are priced almost the same.<br>  With regards to stability, handling and maneuvering, Pulsar is much better. The discs are important to discuss.

4d1ed0b771143afc8f21cd1ebe05d5c4aa	It depends how you drive, the road and traffic conditions, etc., but my 1991 Rover Metro 1.1 tended to give 45.5mpg (about 10 miles per litre) on a long journey. If yours can match that, you will need 11 litres for 110 miles, or about ￡10.<br>  <br>  Remember to include the cost of travel both ways, and also of parking at the airport, before deciding whether to go by train or car.|`|cb73df5e9792cfbcdfe41a093110ec5eaa	your metro gets 45 miles per gallon as per the manufacturer specifications (type in miles per gallon metro) in the search engine.<br>     for 110 miles you need 2 and a half gallons (11.4 litres) x .90p = 10.26p.|`|jfIDk8qAaa	<a href="http://www.torquecars.com/tools/uk-mpg-calculator.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.torquecars.com/tools/uk-mpg-c...</a>|`|EmgiGg17aa	If you don't know your cars miles per gallon (or kilometers per litre; you don't know anything  You need to know that to make a calculation.

Not imperial gallons(which are bigger).|`|FrHVJSB8aa	is it 110 miles each way?if so, a max of about ￡20 if your car is good and you drive sensibly.you should easily get at least 40mpg.
kgk3Yz9Naa	yes the inds are interchangeable...a simple swap fit,no chopping wires....|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	I assume you're talking about the XT660 which is a completely different model, you can fit all sorts of after-market mini indicators to the XT600e and they would certainly be cheaper than the Yamaha, however the connectors might need adapting/replacing – not too tricky a job. But they are, being smaller, less bright and obvious, and might not take as much abuse.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	von Richthofen wasn't all that enchanted with the Dr1, contrary to popular assumptions. German designs had started to fall behind the Allies, for the first time in the air war. The latest fighter, the Albatross DVa was a disappointment-not much improved over the DV (already becoming obsolescent).  The Dr1 was the only new design in production-that had potential.  Pilots also didn't like the rotary engine-like all rotaries it had no true throttle-and the spark plugs fouled after only a few hours.  Which could be disastrous in a fur-ball.<br>  von Richthofen did fly a Fokker prototype he was very impressed with-the DVII, but that wouldn't start production until May.|`|Lbulud8raa	Pretty much.....the Camel was a handful to handle as most of the mass of the aircraft was centred forward in the airframe.  It could turn exceptionally well in the hands of a skilled pilot, but needed to be handled with care, especially to recover from spins.<br>  <br>  The DR1 was Germany's answer to the earlier Sopwith Triplane, a superlative aircraft, though only 140 were built.  Like the Sopwith Triplane, the DR1 was very maneuverable and had a good rate of climb.  The DR1 was fairly slow though, and had a tendency to shed it's wings in flight.  The Camel was more robust, if less easy to maneuver unless the pilot was skilled.  If that was so, then the Camel was almost unbeatable by the standards of the day.  It did lack the excellent field of view that the later Sopwith Snipe had, and the DR1 did have greater visibility too.<br>  <br>  Both aircraft were essentially the last of the major rotary engine designs: inline and radial engines dominated after WW1.<br>  <br>  Compare the aircraft in terms of famous pilots who flew them.  Both aircraft had aces in the pilot's seat, the most famous being Baron Manfred von Richthofen in the DR1<br>  <br>  The Camel had a longer build period, with the DR1 having the typically short build and service life for aircraft of the time.  The DR1 was certainly more of an interim design, a stopgap, and the Camel was in fact a more advanced machine.  This is not to say that the DR1's fearsome reputation is undeserved: it was just a dead end in terms of aircraft development.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	The Camel a reputation for being hard to fly, it had a rotary engine without a throttle control, meaning that the engine was either running wide open or it wasn't running at all. It had an ignition interrupter the pilot could use to cut the engine briefly, when he released it the engine cut on again. Because of the torque of the engine it could turn left quite well, but it's performance in right turns wasn't that great (I could have the turning directions reversed).|`|da59b44452c599e7a03e6a7a72f23754aa	Shebs has just about said it all there.<br>  <br>  Just to expand on the shedding wings bit: The DR1 had a design fault in the wings which meant that it was easy to put more stress on them than they could safely handle. The trick was to push it to the limit but not beyond. Richtofen ws good at things like this. The Germans played it down by blaming it on faulty workmanship and saying that those responsible would be dealt with.
