MPiOoulraa	Proper Food is way better. Plus you can have home made hamburgers and fries with a salad and it tastes way better|`|5QxrQF7yaa	i would probably take a fast food meal over a homemade just because im typically on the move and i use like to walk around when i eat and stuff i just hate sitting still <br>           -adolf oliver pub es|`|YoRRVvCGaa	nooooooooooooooo! nothin compares to home cooked food.  Especially my family, there's more love in home cooked food.  It also depends on what restaurant you're at.  I work at Arby's and We make food that we want others to eat.|`|lzjtINvCaa	a proper meal any day,the only thing fast about fast food is heart burn and the squirts.|`|mBHQEzd1aa	Yes, if I have to cook it.  I'm not much for cooking anymore.|`|yXno8yIkaa	It's way better to eat something you prepared at home, rather then going out.  Although sometimes I do get a craving for fast food, when i do I usually go to Subway.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	No most of it is icky but I do need it every now and then. I think the biggest appeal of fast food is that you don't have to cook it, don't have dishes and it's cheap.|`|f5e77b5c7067c9a50f9b069d33657c40aa	subway<br>  .......Oven-Roasted Turkey, Lettuce, Tomato, :)  on Wheat....Toasted, YUMMYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fvuEtkROaa	No.  (Except, once in a while, a bean burrito)   :-)|`|JQhYc5DVaa	nope<br>  fast foods ok once in a while though i dont eat fast food<br>  a proper meal is just healthier and more nutritional and beneficial for the body. plus, theres nothing like the taste of home:)|`|i8Hmgw9Paa	A "proper" meal any time!!! Fast food is good tasting for what it it is but NOT healthy for you.|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	I like both. A proper meal tastes better but a fast food meal once in a while is great too.|`|WngxQDiaaa	I'd rather have a proper meal...atlthough a nice burger and fries from Burger King is good once in a great while.|`|FGfl9tqdaa	no. you don't know how the fast food has been tampered with! proper meals taste better anyway.|`|rtx7GUCdaa	proper meals <br>  <br>  totally|`|vLOjcH7paa	I guess it depends on how much time I have to eat!<br>  I love baking though - so anything home-made is GREAT! : )|`|5vtZVLdIaa	HELLL YEAHHH i love fastfood, any kind.
3e662pMfaa	If you like sushi go to Haru which is a Beautiful restaurant. Its kind of like modern sushi. Nobu on the other hand i heard it was good. But i heard Nobu is expensive. A also nice sushi place is the Ketsu sushi i think that's whats its called. Its in the Marriott Marquis time square.|`|QCeKQbsLaa	Swish <br>  88 W 3rd St<br>  <br>  they have japanese food, sushi, and Shabu-Shabu.  <br>  <br>  Shabu-shabu is sorta like fondu but with soup. its a lot of fun. great for a small gathering|`|oIsW8FnFaa	Well you what something that is not a lot of money. and where are you going to go. but also how many people are going to go, whats going to be there and at what time if you got all of that and your not going over budget then its ok. not make it on a sunday or a week day because then you can't have a sleep over if you want, and they would have to leave early if you do it on a week day.
JnLoHaoAaa	What does this have to do with dining out? There is no good way to smoke it. It's nasty either way|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Pop can, take a pen, safety pin or something with a sharp tip and make about 6 tiny holes in the middle. Also, I like to use an apple. Take a pen, put a hole in the top, then a hole on the side that meets it. Pot on the top. This is cool when you're outdoors and don't want to get caught. Apple tastes good afterwards too. And if a cop stops you, what are they going to get you on, mis use of fruit? lol|`|k8HpMaHxaa	Anything..an apple, a water bottle, a soda can, even a toilet paper roll if you need to get really basic. Tampon papers roll just as well as regular ones as well.|`|W48xQOJOaa	i don't know i'm a kid but i do know the stuff can kill ya|`|yXno8yIkaa	Hot knife it.|`|ClU6oCG3aa	Don't listen to any of these. You asked best way to smoke it.<br>  <br>  Here's what you do:<br>  <br>  You take a plastic battle, say a coke bottle. <br>  <br>  Open a hole smaller than a dime at the bottom. <br>  <br>  Take a knife and make a whole on the cap big enough to fit a quarter socket or something that will work as a bowl, obviously something that can take heat. <br>  <br>  Fill the bottle with water, keeping your finger on the hole at the bottom, add your smoking material to the cap, screw it on, and light it as you let your finger off the hole.<br>  <br>  You will see the smoke fill the bottle, once all the water is out, unscrew the cap, inhale, and groove.<br>  <br>  Voila, gravity bong.|`|dwzfjlJraa	Well I wouldnt recommend smoking it at all but I remember back in the day I used just about anything with the help of some tin foil or an emty pop can..use your imagination.|`|B3cpzHDZaa	make some special brownies or something|`|Fyt8uQexaa	apple.an apple a day keeps the doctor away|`|AA12338053	pop can will always work in a pinch|`|zzO6Qalsaa	Is this a new recipe type thing?If so would you eat it on pizza?

pbV7dnKKaa	I think your best bet is to go to a lounge where they play music and its laid back or even somewhere that plays live music.

It's got a huge patio and outside area and people bring their dogs..... but they have outdoor fire pits and live music. They cool thing is that you can bring your own smores stuff. They have good food and the service is good too. It's defiantly off the beaten path. You can also go inside and sit, it's got tons of character. <br>  <br>  Also the McKinney Ave trolley, it takes you through uptown and it has all these cafes, restaurants, stores and art gallery's. It's really cool. Best part is you can ride it for free. They also do this dining tour where they stop at one restaurant for appetizer, one for dinner, and one for dessert. IDK how much that is though. <br>  <br>  The Magic Time Machine is always fun too. It's a theme restaurant and all the staff dress up as different charecters, they act crazy and it's way fun!|`|0dbwA1dVaa	Dick's Last Resort. <br>  <br>  It is insanely fun. Look it up online. The whole joke of the restaurant is that the wait staff are purposely rude to you, and you can be rude back... but it's all in good fun. They also make these big hats with funny sayings on them. Mine said, "I still play with naked Barbies." <br>  <br>  Anyways, we all had a pretty good time and it is definitely a fun experience.|`|fr5h1huxaa	Deep Ellum is cool and has everything.|`|3804c41362b69be635d5ce9b2c2404d3aa	Dave and Busters is a good easy choice it is right off of I35E at  the manana exit.|`|NRIulPGEaa	It depends on what type of places they might like. If you like bars with live music, try Sherlock's. There's one in Dallas and one in Addison. They have good food and great happy hour. It's always packed, so if you're planning on getting a table, go early. Also try going to Addison, along Beltline, right around Dallas Toll Way, there are so many places you might enjoy. Not just bars but good places to eat too. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA11692063	guide live in the dallas news paper has all kinds of info on abstract, new inventive places to go do sfuff. piano bars, art shows, plays, food. im not sure if it only comes in the sunday paper or not. but there is tons of things I never knew you could do until I read guide live, there is also guide live on the web but the news paper seems to be easier to find stuff in.

They have been around forever.<br>  <br>  Gabriel's is okay, but it is hit or miss.  <br>  <br>  La Dolce Vita on Preston is really good - the 5 cheese pesto is amazing<br>  <br>  I really like the thin crust cheese pizza at the Standard on Elgin but that is for one person<br>  <br>   Overall, it depends  on whether you like a big hearty pizza or a thin pizza.   <br>  <br>  Milano's is a favourite for many of my friends...but not so much for me.<br>  <br>  <br>   Overall, it depends  on whether you like a big hearty pizza or a thin pizza.|`|xP1bMcsVaa	There's lots o' good pizza places in Ottawa. To start, any chain pizza place (i.e. Pizza Pizza) is horribly offensive to pizza everywhere. I think if your looking for a good pizza, in any city, go to the small Italian places! Try a few out, look around, and you'll find you're ideal pizza place! Good luck brotha!|`|2OfGuVKAaa	Pizza pizza is good. DONT try those crappy pizza restaurants you see everywere that are like, independent, they suck.  I know this isnt part of your question but you should really try Lone Star (restaurant).
JwuEZCwzaa	First and foremost, I must have hot and sour soup. You can usually tell how good a chinese restaurant's food will be by how well they prepare their hot and sour soup.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I love Lo Mein so I'll always order that.<br>  <br>  Third, is some sort of chicken dish. I usually end up going with Kung Pao since it's a good stand by. Otherwise, I might order schezuan chicken or beef, general tsos, salt and pepper squid (that is bomb). <br>  <br>  Why'd you have to limit it to 3? I must have everything on the menu!

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	There isn't much true Greek food here. The closest thing would be Gyro Express, located on Fremont Blvd. and Walnut. They have gyros, which are a Greek-style flatbread and meat sandwich. The restaurant also has non-Greek items that you should avoid (shawarma, falafel, Afghan yogurt). It's pretty fast to eat there. Barring that, you could go to Trader Joes and pick up some Fage yogurt, or go to Costco and get some dolmas, which are grape-leaf rolls.
86fc0a36ed445f3acb8c37c8c987f35baa	Try:<br>  <br>  Thelma's Bar-B-Q<br>  (713) 228-2262<br>  1020 Live Oak St<br>  Houston, TX<br>  <br>  It's much better than Goode and Co. which is too commercial for me.<br>  <br>  Remember Texas Bar-B-Q is differenct from Calgary's!  Enjoy!|`|xEVIxUnkaa	Thelma's had a fire recently and I'm not sure if they are even going to reopen.  Some people really seem have like Thelma's but I found the sauce way too sweet for my taste.  The sweetness overpowered the smoke flavor which is what Texas BBQ is all about.  I still have to say I like Goode Co. the best.|`|6xoTZYpZaa	Theres this place like by a gas station and I cant really like remember how to get there, but you like get in line and they give you milk crates and you sit on benches and their meat is really really good and crap.  I think it may be the best place but actually? I dont think its in houston, I think its a little north or maybe east/west of houston and its right off the road cant miss it if youre on the road next to it.  Big sign out front!  <br>  I hope you like it I sure did!|`|53WL6akOaa	I would recommend Rudy's. It is excellent.|`|UW0NmN2Faa	BEEF N BUN.<br>  IT'S IN FUQUA AND HIRAM CLARKE.

JfVxCDb7aa	lol good one<br>  <br>  yeah they'll claim all kinds of stuff that really stretches the truth at times.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	It's called advertising,let's see what we can get the fool's to believe today???? Check the labels and you will find that "diet" and "healthy" claims are 99% bull sh^t.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	It's only false advertising if they say it's fat free, but it's not (or vice-versa).<br>  <br>  Anyway the real difference between fat-free food and regular food (besides whether fat is there or not) is that in many foods, 'fat free' doesn't mean healthier, and often it's less healthy than the regular kind with fat.<br>  <br>  Instead of trying to only eat fat-free food, eat less regular food. You'll be better off.
