7jKLrwAlaa	Brick Lane, E1.    Closest underground station is Aldgate East on the District Line (Green)    This street is in the heart of the indian community has more indian restaurants than you can shake a stick at.    The trick is to negotiate a good price with the guys on the door, that includes drink, and crucially is not a "per head" price. Order your favourite curry and tell them to spice it up real good.|`|gCJbudnHaa	In Pimlico just around the corner from Victoria station. Little Indian restaurant its lovely but really hot and spicy.

a9wRfuuSaa	If you stick to the cafe at any of the casinos you should be fine. Most of them offer good food around the clock and reasonably priced and every casino should have them.     Also, there are plenty of 24 hour restaurants and late-night eateries around town. If you have a car, then look for an In-n-Out Burger or Fatburger late at night if you have a craving for hamburgers. If you are looking for Chinese, then I would recommend Joyful House on Spring Mountain west of the 15 Fwy. They are open until 3 am and offer large portions, especially late at night.|`|UUx74K5Caa	The cafe @ The Bellagio.|`|S4HUVnzkaa	Never found a place in Vegas that didn't have good food. :D  If in doubt, ask a cabbie, they know all about Vegas.|`|4bedkpvLaa	Results 1  20 Next Print results Name  Distance  Rating        sponsored results   Brand Steakhouse  Learn more about this business     www.lightgroup.com   3770 S.

lIzVMROlaa	Hmmm I had a blast!!! it was my gf aka mikeywa, her nana, her tia, a baby her tia babysits, n me. As we walked in I observed it was crowded but not chaos but orderly havoc as I expected it 2 be. We were seated n placed our orders GRAND SLAMS ALL AROUND!!! And in 5min. Grand slams were in front of us, like magic!!!! Although my eggs were under cooked one quick request n I kid u not jus rite eggs were be4 me in a matter of seconds (or so it seemed). In between bites of pancakes I took in the scene; I enjoyed it, the workers all worked 2gether they looked like a nascar pitcrew team, n in my head I heard the soundaffects that a pitcrew would make. In my experinse it was WELL WORTH IT!!! I haven't had breakfast in the moring in such a long time that it was refreashing and it was free!!! And the servers?!? The best I've had in a while. Every1 from the guy wipin the table, to the lady serving u, 2 the manager were smiling and saying "THANK U 4 COMING 2 DENNY'S" "THANK U SOOO MUCH" "HAVE A GREAT DAY" n they all looked like they were happy, not worn out, or tired, or lying, and the atmosphere in denny's was also a happy family one....so let me say it again I HAD A BLAST!!! N I pitty the foo who didn't go cuz he thought he was 2 kool, u missed out......|`|4604flr2aa	Yes, I went. :) I originally wanted to go with my husband first thing at 6am but when our alarm went off at 4:45 for me to take my shower I decided that wasn't worth free pancakes so I went back to sleep. My husband got up and went without me! LoL He said it was packed but the wait wasn't too long and the service was good.    So I decided to get up around 7:15 and I went with my kids and we brought grandma too! We got there and there was a lot of cars in the lot but we walked right in, no line out the door... there were like 2 or 3 parties ahead of us. We put in our name but we were called in less than 5 minutes for a table. Our food arrived fast too, it was great! We also remembered to leave a TIP on the full amount the bill would have been if the meals weren't free. ;-)    Later in the day we were out driving around and we saw 2 different Dennys that had the lines out the door and wrapped around the building! OMG, crazy!!!|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	No im sorry i missed this historic event.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	No, I couldnt make it.|`|llTqn0Tbaa	i was going to go with my 4 year old brother, but i thought for a sec and said  i can just make it myself, which i did  i didnt want to bother with the long lines or potentially rude servers|`|Bru5jJZraa	No..i feel bad because i can afford to pay for a meal.

I asked for orange juice and it didnt' come till like 30 minutes later when i had to remind her|`|889bdf746f8db41a658d481702371e15aa	No, I get off work at 8am, heard about it on the radio but wasn't hungry.

We got there at 6AM with the parking lot packed. We got inside and found out the wait was an hour..already!! It wasn't worth it to us to wait that long on breakfast so we went across the street to Waffle House. It wasn't as good as Denny's would have been but who wants to wait packed in like sardines with a bunch of other people for an hour while everyone's eating their food staring at you? Not me!

cxNLOPHNaa	Here in the US, we call it "Mickey D's", not "Maccas" which is the British nickname for McDonalds.    As for the prices-  Pricing varies a little from region to region. Transport costs, sourcing, etc, has a lot to do with it. The highest prices are in Hawaii, since everything in the way of supplies/food has to be shipped/flown over. Also a lot of restaurants offer local specials based on the area's demand. Here in my area of LA, the local branch just ended it's Tuesday special of 79 cent "Bucket O Fries" from 4-6pm.    Right now, The Big Mac and Sausage McMuffin are at a nationwide promotional price of 2 for $3.50.    Double Cheeseburgers are currently on the "Dollar Menu", The dollar menu recently underwent a price raise. Most items are now actually $1.19 (small Fries are also on the dollar menu).    Drinks average $1.29 with Med Shakes at $2.80, Ice cream runs about the same as a shake.
UwTB8gM4aa	"Rutt's Hut" in Clifton.  They have been serving fried hot dogs (called 'rippers') for years.  You gotta try 'em to believe 'em!  I think they've been featured on "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" on the Food Network.|`|p8cUpUbNaa	Q. Can you give me some places to eat in NJ that are out of this world?  ______________________________________...  A. How can it be in NJ if it is out of this world? Nj is out of this world? In outer space? McDonalds.|`|K7N0pkU8aa	Ria Mar in Central jersey - it's a Portuguese style restaurant- and the food is amazing-   go with friends who love good food- because it's family style, they serve appetizers and entrees with serving spoons so everyone can share everything  and get a pitcher of the home made sangria it is to die for
MPX0f5jzaa	Huntington Beach is definitely not known for fine dining.  LOL    If you want something on a 19 year old's budget, try something maybe in Seal Beach.  When I was 19 I was hyped if I got Black Angus.  Now I'm spoiled rotten w/ Morton's.|`|cKjjVcaAaa	BJ's on main. its by the peir and you can always get ice cream after.
En0r0UQ3aa	I've given you a general list of options.  Research them and give them a call.    Good  Luck
kqDbWzKvaa	In down town Tacoma there are some High end restaurants.  sea grill, Pacific grill. melting pot and several more.  They will be apparent to you due to the fact they are near the UW.  Sounds like you need to make a lot of money.  Hope you are  trained and have   a lot of experience as a high end server. Tacoma has lots of nice restaurants check out the water front places for employment they do a lot hiring   college students.  good luck.  Tacoma is a wonderful place to live and work I hope you are successful and enjoy the UW.
MJvL013yaa	H careers is pretty helpful (as in Hospitality careers)    I am in Illinois, and what I have ALWAYS done is decide where I want to work, then apply there every 3 weeks. Eventually they will get used to seeing you, see how determined you are, and hire you! Worked for me three different times (I am possibly on my fourth- fingers crossed). I also work in fine dining (NOT CHAINS) privately owned steakhouses. I make average $75 a day working from 11 to 2 or 3 or 4.     If you're not that picky- just looking for the fast cash, check your local paper.   Good luck!|`|DTrqM46taa	craigslist

5C7wKDcRaa	"One-Way" - Guests travel down or around the buffet table in one direction.    "Two-Way" - Guest travel down both sides of the buffet table.  Allows faster serving/gathering of food by guests.|`|ebD1plKNaa	No idea really, but I can guess.    My best guess is that one way buffet service is the traditional serving line like you would see at restaurants like Luby's, Furr's and other cafeteria style eateries and some oriental food places like Panda Express.    Again, guessing here, I would think that two way buffet service would be a marketing technique to get more people to the food by having people on both sides of the food, like many oriental food restaurants and places like Ryan's and Golden Coral.    One way and two way buffet may also refer to how you go about getting seconds.  In some places, you go through the line once, then flag a food server in some fashion to get extras.  This might be called "one way buffet."    In other restaurants, if you want more food, you get up and return to the buffet line.  This of course, could be called "two way buffet."    Hopefully, this helps some.  Good luck.|`|MJvL013yaa	I can't believe I don't know this, but I am guessing Danny is right. As in One way- You would prolly have cooks and servers on the other side: telling what the items are, helping serve, getting refills.   Two way would be lines down both side (faster- like a company party dealio) and less formal|`|7av5snGvaa	IT THE BEST
