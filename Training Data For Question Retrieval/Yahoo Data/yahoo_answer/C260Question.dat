Why does all the good anime end with only a few episodes. Ok let me just give you my list you don't have to agree but still  1. Air Gear- ended early with shitty ending  2. Girls Bravo- was good but waaaaay to short  3. FMA(full metal alchemist)- one of the best but also way to short  4. Inuyasha- was long but ended with to much left open  the 4 above are my main ones. Now I know that FMA is making like a rerun or new season or whatever and Inuyasha is gonna make some new episodes in the future BUT..... My question that I would like you all to answer is why does all the good anime end right when it gets good? Its like they give us a taste and then end it why????? but shitty anime like pokemon stays on for 10 years.......

20090205042435AAv9p09	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How would you handle having these slightly silly names with dignity or humor?	Ladies...Imagine these was the ''Victorian era.'' you married a nice good looking and rich gentleman.. and it's definitely not possible for you.. back then to change your name.. nor do you want to poison or kill your nice husband who is really wonderful .. the only problem is that you have a silly first name and marrying him and taking on his surname makes this name slightly embarrassing or hilarious.. you are a lady.. if someone giggles when they hear your name spoken.. how would you extricate yourself of this situation with either quick wittedness or a sense of humor.. you are a lady so rudeness is not allowed only hidden sarcasm may be used..      Your name is Wanda Gotobed 'Wanna go to bed'' is what it sounds like      What great ideas do you have..         Gentlemen... you also live in Victorian times and sometimes get made fun of by other gents when they hear your name.. How do you handle this without causing a brawl or lashing out?      Your name is Hugh Darling  '' sounds like   you Darling''?      Can you come up with some funny ways to respond to people poking fun at your names.. and remember.. these are Victorian times, so a name change is not possible.. and the ladies.. you really love Mr Gotobed.. it's lot a great name but he is a great guy and not his fault that of all first names you have to be called ''Wanda'' to make it worse so you don't want to ''bump'' him of.. I am looking forward to some quick witted or humorous ways how you deal with people who laugh when they hear your names...the same goes for the Gents.. you are a Darling.. so no brawling remember Hugh Darling?

First, I fall asleep, and I go late to my office. My boss, outrageous, fires me. When I leave the building, to my car, I found out it was stolen. The police said that they can do nothing. I get a cab to return home, and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away."

He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:      "Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck." If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you."      To which his wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He wwas whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!"

20090205052619AA283jC	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	How can a classical composer just starting out get works performed?	I have a First Class Honours BMus degree, a symphony, violin concerto and a multi-movement string quartet, along with numerous shorter chamber pieces.  However, I am struggling with finding organizations who will perform these pieces, let alone commission me for a new piece.        I have a recording of the symphony and the string quartet, but the symphony performance was done by an amateur orchestra and the quality isn't that good.  The string quartet is much better as the quartet was a first class ensemble, but I still struggle to get other quartets to consider it.      Is there a best way to present the music?   Is there a good time of the year?  or established protocol?     Would a website help? or just a waste of money (and effort)

20090205044701AAZYQB7	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Aquarius guy - ARGH!!?	I met him in the end of November. The very first time we hung out, it was basically as a date. He took me out to dinner and we went back to my place and played video games. And we shared our first kiss that night, too. We started seeing each other once a week, and we have always kissed each time.    There was a three week period in which we didn't see each other in December because of Winter Break. But we saw each other when it ended, and it pretty much picked up where we last started. He even brought a gift for me, and I did bring a gift for him.    There were two weeks when I didn't see him. I know I had to give him space, so I waited for his call, and he eventually did call and we met. But this time, he didn't kiss me. At all, just a hug, saying we should hang out again and that I should call if I wanted to.    I am SO CONFUSED. I know I should be. I have read so much on the Aquarius to get a little more of an understanding.    Please, I would appreciate advice from personal experiences. I have read so many things online, I would prefer not to have links to websites.    I have eventually called him and we spoke for a few minutes, he seemed distant (but he was doing laundry).  He said he would call me when he was free for this upcoming weekend.  But I am also worried because there is this old friend that he has who is female that he promised to take on a road trip.    This makes me worried especially since I don't have a right to say anything since we are not in a relationship.  So there are two things: he did not kiss me last time I saw him and he is taking a close female friend on a road trip.      I do know that it must take something from a guy (an interest) for them to initiate a hug with a girl.  But I am not sure.    So what should I do? Am I alright? Did I do something wrong? Is he testing me? I know I haven't known him for a while, but is what we have going downhill? Is he doing the "just-friends" thing? I don't want to be just friends with him, I really like him. I know though that we only know each other for so little time.    Help!! :( I'm a Gemini-Cancer Cusp if that helps any.

On the other hand, one could say he was not an amateur, having come from a singing family.  By the way, this doesn't mean I'm an Osmond Family fan---I really thought he was good and cute.

20090205061555AAEE7pW	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P : Has anyone here read 'Watchmen'?	I just finished it last night, in anticipation of the movie.   I was very, very disappointed, given the level of hype surrounding it for the last two decades.     I found the story to be both bloated and cliche, and some sub-plots (such as the pirate story) to be completely irrelevant, and they weighed the story down unnecessarily.   I get the fact that they were heroes with different moralities from one another, and that was interesting and accurate, but I am no more amped to see the film than I was before I started the book.    What were your thoughts on 'Watchmen'?   I'm especially interested in hearing from those who loved it.  I'd like to hear your perspectives.    Bonus music question : Favorite rock song(s) referring to heroes of some kind?

20090205064738AAeZ4jk	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What kind of keyboard is the best alternative to the traditional acoustic piano?	I am looking for a keyboard instead of a traditional because I am at school and it's not affordable.       Anyway, I just want a keyboard that would be the best alternative to the traditional. I want a good keyboard with all the awesome features, but I still want it to sound REAL and not so completely digital like many.       I was looking at the Yamaha DGX530 and the Yamaha YPG235...   however, I do not have much experience buying keyboards, therefore I do not know if these are good choices for what I want. 'Technically' I'll be a beginner teaching myself but I hope to get really good...      Any recommendations???!

Does she know what he is doing before he does it? And why does she go up to where Raoul is sitting while Christine is singing Think of Me?       Since it is Meg at the beginning with Raoul at the auction, did her and the Phantom become close after her mother's death? Who sits in box 5 that is supposed to be left open for the Phantom?      there is so much that is never answered in this movie.    it is still by far my favorite movie :D.

20090205061712AAPlleb	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	What can I do, to get men to stop treating me like a bimbo?	I am 26. I'm currently trying to break into the music industry as a song-writer/artist/consultant. I have my Bachelors degree in Mass Communications/Print Journalism and have worked for a few magazines and newspapers. I currently work as an Administrative Assistant for a University as well. Okay, well---every time I meet people who always happen to be men who are in the music industry---it's like getting through THICK RED tape just to get taken seriously. No, I don't dress provocatively. No I don't engage in sexual innuendo conversations. No I don't have dates with them or sleep with them. It's just the opposite. I present them with my goals/visions/work---yet they get mad when they realize I'm not interested in "getting it on" with them. This is becoming so FRUSTRATING...because I feel like, I have to "be this ditsy flirty" chick for men in the business/music world to take me seriously.

God I hope not... the Brothers Strause's Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is the worst film I ever watched, it's a big insult to the Alien and Predator franchises, AVP:R's story, dialog and actors really sucked, the only things I liked in the film, was that they've shown the Predator homeworld for the first time on screen, the Predalien, and Ms. Yutani, that's it, the rest of the film really sucked...    I think Paul W.S. Anderson or James Cameron or Ridley Scott or a combination of the three would be best to direct...

20090205084329AAcJHDf	Entertainment & Music;Movies	There are too many 'Disney Dog Movies.' Anymore cat ones?	Disney is really starting to lose it's originality. They've made TOO many Disney Dog Movies (The Air Bud series, Beverley Hills Chihuahua, 101 Dalmatians, Bolt.. the list is endless) and there is also SIX more movies about dogs that are currently listed as being in production.      I'm getting fed up of all the dog movies. Dogs really aren't that clever. Sure they can do tricks, but other animals can be trained to do so as well.      I'd like to see some movies involving different animals. Maybe cats, or birds.. or fish (Finding Nemo was a success..!)      I don't want to see any more dog movies.   They are getting really really tiresome.      There is nothing special about dogs. I don't have anything against dogs.. it's just there are too many disney dog movies.    Heh. :-)

The former general manager of the B.C. Lions and current GM of the Saskatchewan Roughriders has been charged with sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl.      Who else thinks this pedophile should be castrated?  Okay, yes 16 year olds are not children, BUT the guy was 51. That's just not right. And this does go for all genders when it comes to child abuse. All should be punished. So get off your high horses Just because I'm accusing a man this time. When it was Mary Kay Letournea turn I asked the same question.         The guy is a pedophile. Whether it was consensual or not, this guy is a pedophile. First of all, the age difference is tremendous. Sure the legal age all over the place is around 16, but that is in relation to age, get real people, this man is 51 and in a position of authority. He's a father of teenagers for crying out loud. Its really going to be interesting to see how many other GIRLS will come forward after these allegations. ERIC TILLMAN .. YOU DESERVE NOTHING LESS THAN CASTRATION.      Does anyone else feel the way I do?

20090205082331AAu91jQ	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Your thoughts on Tsundere characters?	For you who's unfamiliar to the term, "Tsundere" is derived from the words "tsuntsun" and "deredere," meaning "aloof, pointed, morose" and "exhausted, lovestruck" respectively. A tsunderekko (tsundere girl) can express this in one of two ways:      1) She is initially combative/aloof/cold, either towards the protagonist or everybody, and through the course of the story opens up and becomes emotionally vulnerable and loving (basically a personality shift through time).      2) She is combative/aloof/cold on the outside, but secretly she feels very vulnerable and loving (basically she puts up a farce to hide the 'real her').   --------------------------------------      Personally, they're my favorite character archetype in anime. Some can be bitchy about the slightest things, but people find them really moe (excessively cute) when they blush.      Some of the most prominent names of tsundere: Shana, Louise de la Valliere, Aisaka Taiga, Hiiragi Kagami, Narusegawa Naru, Soryu Asuka Langley, Tohsaka Rin.      Just trying to spread the love. Now that you have an idea who they are, your thoughts?

20090205073251AAUCeLl	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards?	Ok so Tarantino is my favorite director, i just love him. But his last movie Death Proof was kinda bad, because it was boring, i liked the way it ended, but it took too long to get there. I mean he was coming off of Kill Bill and guest directing Sin City and it was prolly hard to compete with Planet Terror cuase that was good. So my question to you think Inglorious Bastards is going to be a Tarantino classic like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill or another dud like Death Proof? I cant really get a feel for it i know its about Nazis and WWII and a German girl seeking revenge, so i imagine its going to be bloody. And has anyone seen the original of this movie?

20090205005343AABrjGt	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Looking for the name of an old anime fairy tale series.?	I used to have a video tape (tapes?) in the 80's of fairy tales.  It was in a style that I now know is anime.  This is very obscure, and I've found a few mentions of various cartoons from the video.  I know it included the Red Shoes, Ali baba, the Ugly Duckling.  There was also one about a tiger...he went to live with people, and  was worried about a leak in the house, thinking it was some kind of animal.      The one I really want to see again was about a giant -possibly made out of snow.  It was based on Norse (viking) mythology, mentioning Odin, the Titans, and so on.  There was a giant who fell asleep for 1000 years.  He looked like a big mountain so no one noticed.  He woke up and it was modern times.  He befriended a little boy. I remember him doing something with a train and powerlines, and I think he saved the boy's life.  There was a little evil looking imp running around (possibly Loki, the god of fire and mischief, but I don't know if they said his name), and I remember the children being scared of the giant and throwing snow balls.  He picks up a girl who screams.  This is all I remember.  Does anyone know this video?  Do you own it?  Any details, cover photos, links where to buy, the company who made it would be greatly appreciated.      I'm mostly interested in the giant story and the tiger story, as they are very obscure.      Thanks for any info!

Then ask your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars, and then ask your brother if he'd sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars. Then come back and tell me what you learn from that."   So little Johnny went to his mother and asked, "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"     "Of course I would! We could really use that money to fix up the house and send you kids to a great University!"   Next he asked his sister, "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"     "Oh my God! I LOVE Brad Pitt I would sleep with him in a heartbeat. Are you nuts?"    Then he went to his brother and asked, "Would you sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars?"     "Of course," he said, "do you know what a million bucks would buy?"   Little Johnny pondered the answers for a few days, then went back to his dad.    "Well" his father said, "Did you find out the difference?".   Little Johnny replied, "Yes....... 'potentially', you and I are sitting on three million dollars.............. but 'realistically', ........ we're living with two slags and a poofter."

20090204221223AAgcXIj	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Old Cartoon Network  advertisement. I wondering if anyone could help.?	I'm looking for a video or audio clipping of an old Cartoon Network   advertisement. I wonder if anyone could help.      About seven or eight years back, there was an short (1 min?)   advertisement for Cartoon Network, that used to run on Cartoon   Network, in which a creature (a dog?) in opera coat-tails would sing a   Cartoon Network-version of Mozart's Figaro (I think). I don't remember   the words very well, but it was mostly the names of a great number of   cartoon characters strung together -- here are some parts that I do   remember, though perhaps not verbatim: "... there's fred and wilma,   barney and betty...", mentions of magilla gorilla, wally gator, the   jetsons (I think) and ends with "the cartoon network, the cartoon   network, home of the top toon stars", during which time the audience   throws all kinds of stuff at the singing animal.      I'd like to get hold of an audio or video clip of this -- preferably   video, of course, but I realize that may be more difficult. It used to   be shown a great deal on Cartoon Network. I'm sorry I don't have any   more information about the song itself, but it's been a long time   since I've seen this particular ad, and all I can remember are sketchy   details. But if anyone _has_ seen it, I doubt that they would forget   it.

20090205075301AAmuvco	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	I used to be able to sing high notes, but can't anymore. How can I retrain my voice?	I am a 16 year old girl. I come from a family of sopranos - my grandmother was an opera-singer and my mother is a trained singer as well. When I was little, I showed a natural talent for singing, and could sing well, and very high. But I didn't appreciate the talent and didn't use it...for whatever reason, I "rebelled" against what my mom wanted me to do. As a result, my voice is a lot deeper and has lost its quality. I can control it, but I don't have much of a range...can't sing very low or high at all. But now that I'm older and wiser, I'd like to be able to sing...not professionally, but well enough that I'm not embarassed to open my mouth. My brother (he's 10) can sing higher than me! What can I do to expand my range and get my natural ability back?

Well I was trying to call Mojoes, where they're having the concert, because I wanted to find out how much the tickets were. Well it was disconnected. So my mom started calling other Mojoes nearby, including Mojoes Rock House, and Mojoes Coffee House. They were all disconnected, so my mom called a hair salon that used to be next door to Mojoes Coffee House in Orland Park, and they said that it closed down and it's no longer there. But School Boy Humor has posted bulletins on their myspace confirming their concert, and making remarks on how excited they were, etc. I don't get how they're planning on having a concert at a spot that doesn't exist. And if it does, I really need to find out, because it seems i'm the only person who's actually tried calling. Please help me, it would be such a big help! Thank you!:]

20090205075538AAP840R	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Tropic Thunder - Awesome Movie But Offensive?	I have to admit that I DID NOT think the movie was offensive. The simple jack bit I thought was just ridiculous and inoffensive. I didn't think that the feral underclass / lowlife element of society would particularly copy the offensive aspects of this movie any more than they do already. I have moved in that circle and know that they are offensive people, regardless of whether they have a buzzword to use or not.      BUT      I laughed and laughed and Mathew McConnachie's son the first time I saw the movie. I DID NOT READ that he might be a disabled boy until my wife pointed it out. Even now I am not sure that he is meant to be disabled. I am sure that if he is meant to be disabled, I don't like it and am sad that they did that instead of just making him a loser boy (as I first thought).      So is the son meant to be disabled or not? The space invaders bit at the end qualified (it seems) my original thought that he was just a loser boy with a head full of video games and crap.      Thoughts please.

Hi guys, I was wondering how wach of you imagined the characters for the movie.  this is how I pictured some:      Jacob black (Steven Strait):     http://imagecloset.com/15/682c5b931dd218...       Edward Cullen (Jonathan Rhys Meyer):    http://www.masalladeorion.es/wp-content/...     http://www.tvboyfriends.com/wp-content/u...    I don't find him very attractive but there's something in him, maybe it's the feautures on his face, his bones, the shape of his face and lips and the color of his eyes that make me think about Edward      Alice Cullen (Shannyn Sossamon):    http://www.libertyfilmfestival.com/liber...     http://www.shannyn-sossamon.org/albums/P...    I think she makes a great Alice!      Rosalie Cullen (Laura Ramsey):    http://www.vidfad.com/images/laura-ramse...       Carlisle Cullen (John Ralston):    http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/flashg...       Renee (Rachel Blakely):    http://img.osobnosti.cz/foto/rachel-blak...          Bella (Anna Paquin):     http://eslatele.com/wp-content/uploads/a...     http://www.scifidesktop.org.uk/gallery/a...    I am not very sure about this one, I couldn't find anyone that suited her better. I can't put an actress to Bella, she only exists in my head. I believe though that Anna looks good as Bella.      But oh well, that's just me, I think those are the only I pictured recently. What do you guys think? What characters you've imagined?   Have a nice start of the year!

20090205081509AAES9MG	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	SCORPIO MAN ADVICE NEEDED!!!!?	I met this Scorpio man last year. We had a whirlwind romance for a couple months. I fell in love. He was a mystery. Nonetheless, we had a serious connection that was incredible. He moved for a job. We agreed to go our separate ways. Both of us were separated from our spouses and going through  divorces anyways. It was bad timing to get serious. We didnt talk for months. Then he contacted me out of the blue one day telling me that he wanted me back. I was hesitant because his divorce was not final and I really wasn't in the mood for more heartbreak. He assured me his divorce was almost through and that he really wanted me back in his life. I remained guarded since he was a thousand miles away anyways. Then his wife got wind of his phone calls to me and she began to harrass me. I couldn't handle it and in all the confusion I cut off all contact with him completely.     Then a couple months after that incident (I was compelled by the death of a loved one to speak my heart) I confessed in a letter that I had loved him and I would always remember him.  I didnt expect anything in return and had honestly let go and moved on.     Now 3-4 months later he has responded to this letter. He didnt say anything about my profession of love but has asked me to contact him. He can't get me out of his mind.    Not sure what to make of this? What is the deal with this Sun Sign?    PS. I am a Libra! :)

I would like people to nominate their very one and only Album Cover..those 12" things that had Artwork,and even gate-fold inside covers with lyric sheets.Think carefully..5 days..don't go spinning out on "Look At Yourself"/Zep 3's inner wheel/"Frankenchrist"/"Their Satanic Majesties etc"..if that's your thing,go for it..Neon Park,Hypgnosis,Roger Dean,Rick Griffin etc..Barney did the early Hawkwind LP covers and created an express image that was unique to them as a unit.

Good Luck Guys.This is not a back-flip in Time..just remembering the day.

It's "Balto's Race to Nome," it was made in 1925, it's 30 minutes and it's black and white, Sol Lesser directed it.      I suspect it's not available being so old and all, but I'm still hoping.

20090205081938AAb4UBN	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Have you heard the Joke about the Princess?	Once upon a time there lived a King. The King had a beautiful daughter,  the Princess. But there was a problem. Everything the princess touched would melt.   No matter what; metal, wood, stone, anything she touched would melt. Because of this, men were afraid of her. Nobody would dare marry her. The king despaired. What could he do to help his daughter?   He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, 'If your daughter touches one thing that does not melt in her hands, she will be cured.'   The king was overjoyed and came up with a plan.   The next day, he held a competition. Any man that could bring his daughter an object that would not melt would marry her and inherit the king's wealth.   THREE YOUNG PRINCES TOOK UP THE CHALLENGE.   The first brought a sword of the finest steel. But alas, when the princess touched it, it melted. The prince went away sadly .   The second prince brought diamonds.   He thought diamonds are the hardest substance in the world and would not melt. But alas, once the princess touched them, they melted. He too was sent away disappointed.     The third prince approached. He told the princess, 'Put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in there.'   The princess did as she was told, though she turned red .   She felt something hard. She held it in her hand.   And it did not melt!!!   The king was overjoyed. Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed.   And the third prince married the princess and they both lived happily ever after.     Question: What was in the prince's pants?   (Scroll down for the answer)                           M&M's of course.   They melt in your mouth, not in your hand. What were you thinking??

I am not saying she is a bad actor but when I read the books (twilight, new moon, eclipse, breaking dawn) I always imagined her like softer I guess. Like her voice came on way to strong and so did her body. Bella was supposed to be fragile and in the movie she did not seem as fragile as I imagined. maybe I am crazy but it frustrates me i guess. and i know the movie was only loosely based on the book but it made me a little disappointed. but everything else amazing i love twilight :) !!!

20090205082502AAr9tpT	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	My girlfriend dumped me after my brother played a prank on her (need advice) ?	Last saturday my gf was at my house and we were sat in the living room watching TV, with my younger brother (who is 13) and her best friend. She got up to get something from the kitchen and when she sat back at down, she set off a woopie cushion which my brother had put on her seat when she left the room, then he discreetly spayed "fart spray". My brother is a little immature but he always does pranks like this whenever we have guests over and the guests usually laugh and go along with it. But this was my gf's first time over, and she was very embarrased and angry. I didn't notice him doing it btw but she immediately left the room, went to the bathroom in floods of tears. I tried to comfort her and explain but she didnt want to be anywhere near me. Then she left with her friend. I called her the next day to apologize for my bro's prank but she said she believes I was in on it and that she doesnt want to see me ever again. At first I thought she was just overeacting and would get over it, but she hasn't replied to my calls and texts all week. I'm afraid that I've lost her forever just because of one stupid prank.       How can I prove to her that I wasn't in on it, how to convince her that she's overreacting and has nothing to be embarrased about (in other words she should loosen up a little). Most importantly how do I win her back? SERIOUS answers only please, I've tried asking my friends and my dad for advice but they just laugh at the whole situation.

Some concert venues, the majority of them here, serve alcohol, and all ages shows are allowed, or 18+ shows.   I'm sure this is b/c it is established as a venue, and not a bar.      Bars, some allow 18+ shows. But, most are 21+.. They used to have all ages shows, and made a notarized form for minors to be allowed in..      Anyways.. I just need to know the differences in bar laws, and venue laws. Since they both serve alcohol...      I dont want opinions,I want actual facts, or sites telling me the laws that differentiate these.      Note:   Some bars allow all ages shows on some nights, and 21+ other nights.   Some also have dividers, minors on left side away from bar..   21+ on right side, having access to bars.   Eh..
