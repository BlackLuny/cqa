RkfIPD7Iaa	I'm curious whether any of those stating 'that's illegal!' could provide a single piece of law which actually says that.<br>  <br>  In fact, there is no specific laws which control who within a company an employee may speak to.  You do have rights to have your pay correct and any problems addressed, but if that can be handled by working through the direct supervisor, that is perfectly legal.<br>  <br>  Like the one person above, I agree that this sounds as if the HR department probably requested that supervisors handle routine inquiries.  I'm sure if it goes beyond that, you can deal directly with them.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Let's see...HR stands for "Human Resources" and you are a resource of the company so don't listen to your boss and contact them whenever needed. They get paid to take care of your issues so use them. Matter of fact you should be reporting what your boss stated to you to them...now.|`|5eQeHJJiaa	Why do you think the HR department is there?!?!?! You should have also told them that your boss is not allowing you to contact them (since you did in fact contact them you would say he is TELLING you not to) or you could grow a pair and ask your boss himself, maybe he's planning a secret santa and doesnt want anyone in HR to know.|`|M41jJp0Laa	It is illegal for your boss to prevent you from contacting your HR department if you have a legitimate reason to do (especially in cases of sexual harassment). If this continues to happen, I suggest consulting with a lawyer on the issue.|`|ItFYVwlDaa	This situation sounds a little strange.  It could be that the HR department was getting a lot of inquiries that could have been answered by the employee's own department.  You should ask your boss why this rule has been enacted.|`|C2HHfun2aa	It isn't legal. I have never worked for a company were you couldn't talk to HR.|`|Q4wQEfCqaa	Sounds like he's hiding something (the boss)  you have every freakin' right to contact HR.  If this boss continues and you can't get this remedied, I'd suggest (document everything!) going to your local labor board or attorney and telling them.  You've got to know your rights!  I've had to go to the labor board several times in my life b/c of unpaid time.

The military see it as they are your kids, your husband is deployed and your responsibility is those kids, enlistment for active duty until your hubby is back or he gets out probably isn't an option, but you could possibly do reserves.|`|IQmjPecYaa	I don't think they will let you join unless your hubby signs papers along with you to let your children stay with family through your basic training. I think it is awesome that you are going to do something with your life, and support your children. I sit at home with my kids, but that is my choice. I hope you get things figured out! Keep calling the recruiter and he/she should be able to help you out! :)|`|V38XNnhCaa	Not 100% sure if they will let you enlist but you will need a solid family care plan ready to go.  Being dual military is hard I did it for six years with 1 child and one deployment together.  Your husband also will need a family care plan in effect if you can enlist and get through MEPS.

As you say, if Obama's family did any of these things, we'd never hear the end of it.|`|HOTDwmEoaa	Conservative family "values" are not shared by liberal families, whose values have much more meaning through actions as well as words.|`|YzPACLKJaa	not really her mother-in-law if they're not married, not being critical, just noting.|`|1zYC6snlaa	Agreed with you 100%. It seems as though their entire family and associates do drugs. Recently the oldest son has been outted as being a huge druggie, and that Bristol did some drugs herself.<br>  It's not that we expect them to be perfect. It's the fact that they SAID they were the perfect family who does everything right and nothing ever bad. Yet it's been nothing but drugs, corruption and horrible morals.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it were Obama's family the repubs wouldn't shut up about it. I mean, of course Obama's family is not perfect. Repubs are calling Obama's cigarette smoking a drug addiction and that he won't be able to do his job (although many presidents have smoked in the past). They just FIND things to bash about and even though their candidate is millions times worse, they defend them and contradictorily bash any democrat because of their standing.<br>  I voted Obama, but if Obama's family was ANYTHING like Palin's family (with their "work ethic" (or should I say lack of) and overall) I would never vote for him because it would be the wrong thing to do because of how horrible he would be. But it's Palin. Ironically, republican side. Not my choice, I don't judge by party, but by who the people really are.<br>  <br>  No, she is not related to her and this just is bad luck. But I don't hang around people who do drugs. I don't date people who do drugs or have relatives that do drugs. Palin surrounds herself with bad people, just like herself. But yeah, it's not her fault. But you also can't say Cindy's drug problem is not McCain's fault. He should have stopped her. But then again we all know their marriage was not for love... so yeah.<br>  The Palin's have A LOT of problems with their family and she would make a HORRIBLE anything. I wouldn't trust her as assistant manager in a grocery store!  But yes, this really has no dealing with her. But I think we can use this against her since Palin used that "Palling around with terrorist" thing when it was a lie. So now we can use what she used on him. And she will complain and call it sexism. Oh, grow up Palin. You're just a horrible person. Being a female has nothing to do with it. According to Palin, I do drugs because I go to school, but do not talk directly, with people who do drugs. Even the fact that I DON'T do drugs, according to Palin I do drugs because I was in a school where druggies once were. Oh, and she also calls me Un-American because I live in a big city. Hello! You're the one inciting terror into others! What is the word for that? Oh, yeah, terrorist!!!! The exact definition, she is it.<br>  <br>  Want to know another funny fact? The republican states are ranked highest in drug uses and underage pregnancy :)  So much for "abstinence only" lol. As LOVELY as it worked with Palin's kids!|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Guilt by association is not something I can support. I didn't support it when Palin said Obama "pals around with terrorists" and I cannot do so now because of Palin's future in-laws. It has been months after the election, people still line up behind their parties and attack, attack, attack. It is time to see ourselves as Americans first and party membership needs to take a back seat.<br>  Why adopt the same tactics which failed to get McCain elected now? I hope we take the higher ground and stick with the issues and not engage in character assassinations.|`|fgRtf9CIaa	What happens to Sarah's daughter's mother-in-law has no basis on Sarah herself! The media probably wouldn't would follow the story if it was someone related to Obama though.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, the fact that Obama's aunt is here illegally (and in government paid housing) and Obama knew about it, that is an issue since it's directly tied to Obama.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Well, yeah, since, according to police officials, the governor (Palin) did not know of the pending arrest, then I fail to see how the missed serving of a warrant could reflect upon Palin in any way.<br>  I don't see how the arrest of the mother of her daughter's boyfriend could reflect upon Palin in any way, either.  The woman is not related to her.  Even if her daughter marries the young man, his mother will STILL not be a relative of Palin's, even by marriage.<br>  Yet you say all the scandal and controversy surrounding Obama and his circle of associates and friends does not reflect upon Obama.<br>  Strange.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	1. Since the governor was not aware then this issue is moot. Additionally, since this is not about Sarah Palin at all your entire point is illogical.<br>  2. If gang-banging, drug-dealing, ghetto blacks do not represent all black people then Brisol's M-I-L does not represent Christians (I also have never heard her claim to be one).<br>  3. McCain was not "soundly defeated". 39% of registered voters picked Obama and 35% picked McCain. That is not a landslide by any definition.<br>  4. We would never find out about the wrong-doings of a member of Obama's family.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	So, according to one source, and without any supporting evidence, you choose to believe this attack story of the delayed arrest warrant? You should be skeptical of all allegations related to politics.<br>  <br>  Because without evidence, that makes this guy's story simply a rumor and propaganda. And it means you are gullible and easily led when you then take this rumor and make accusations based on it.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Get over it...now. Not worth the time or the dime to discuss. Really.

Period.<br>  <br>  Okay, not smoking but Possession.  Whether you buy it, somebody else buys it, or even if someone else buys it, gives it to their friend, who in turn gives it to you, etc.  You have to possess it in order to smoke it, and it's still illegal.
Re9Pdfxbaa	You CAN NOT get 13 years for Murder. The only sentence you can receive for Murder is a life sentence. When sentenced the judge sets a tariff (the minimum amount you must serve) but you remain in prison until you have progressed to be a low risk to society. which can be many year after the tariff set by the judge. Example; A terrorist would receive a 30 year tariff a man who kills his wife because he found her in bed with another man may get a 12 year tariff because it was a one off offence and he may not ever be a further risk to society. All life sentence prisoners remain on Life Licence until the day they die. They only have to break the rules of the licence and they are immediately returned to prison.<br>  Sentencing does seem irrational. The "drive by " shootings in Manchester saw the shooters get 36 years each this was due to political pressure to stamp this sort of crime out.|`|Qqj1VTmXaa	In the UK there is only one sentence for murder amd that's life which a person will serve a minimum of 15yrs before being considered for release on licence by the home office, the person is on licence for the rest of his life and is subject to recall to prison if he breaks the strict conditions of his licence|`|RjUhISEIaa	Plead guilty and get 13 years.

It's a lot cheaper to give someone a card than to hunt them down, export them and then attempt to ensure they don't come back.<br>  <br>  Besides, here's what's written on the base of the Statue of Liberty, the gateway to our nation:<br>  <br>  Give me your tired, your poor,<br>  Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br>  The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br>  Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:<br>  I lift my lamp beside the golden door.|`|gc16g57Iaa	We should have a strict immigration quota at any time.

8gi5gfOsaa	Arrest powers vary with jurisdictional considerations, but it is a somewhat dimwitted individual who would place himself in such a precarious position. First of all, if he invokes arrest powers granted him by his employing government authority, he is acting under the color of law. This then raises the sphere of civil rights concerns under both Section 1983 and section 1985 of title 42 of the U.S. Code. You have a "cowboy" cop in your case as outlined above. His waistline probably correlates very closely with his IQ. Most law enforcement training guidelines today recommend an off duty officer contact police agencies as would an ordinary citizen and simply wait for on duty personnel to respond, unless there is an overwhelming threat of imminent bodily harm or death. The charges you list are simply a tactic deployed to hopefully help him "cover your ***", or CYA as we called it in the military. His actions do not reflect adequate consideration of potential liabilities nor reflect highly on whatever agency allows him to carry a badge of authority. <br>  <br>  It really sounds as though all involved could use a refresher course in anger management, including your daughter. You need to file a complaint with the police oversight board for whatever department he is employed by. It might also prove prudent to contact the ACLU to obtain a referral to a competent attorney who handles civil rights actions and especially police misconduct. Everything he did was abusive and totally contrary to standard operating procedures. If for no other reason than to gain dismissal of her charges, you should let police personnel know you are seeking legal advice regarding this off duty person's conduct. He showed extremely poor judgment and may be predisposed to abuse of power and authority. Fellows like him need to be reigned in before they really hurt someone and cost government insurance carriers a heavy payout due to his obvious lack of training.<br>  <br>  Take me home country road!!|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	"She kept demanding that he show her proof that he was a cop.

"At the end, he told her that he was a cop and for her to move away from him or he would arrest her. She didn't believe him, d/t the fact that he had no identifying clothing or a badge on him. He called for backup and when she walked outside" i'm assuming she didn't do anything after he told her to stay away. So in that instance she complied with his orders so he had no reason to follow her, and this ex-boyfriend shouldn't have even been helping the cop arrest her unless he asked him for help until backup arrived.  the whole cigarette thing was a bad thing on her part. sounds like both parties are guilty of at least having too much attitude.|`|JgXLpnmTaa	An off duty cop cannot arrest you. He can detain you until backup arrives to issue a ticket, but he himself cannot hand cuff you or anything. He has to announce him/herself as Officer (name), and hold you there until backup does arrive. <br>  <br>  And he can't do anything about her knocking him down. if he was on-duty, then he can, but when he's off duty. he cant do anything. It's pretty much civilian to civilian. She did nothing for him to arrest her. He cant just be like "you pushed me, you're under arrest" what he did was wrong. He should have showed ID, and warned her he was a cop.<br>  <br>  He never showed proof, and he assaulted her. If you have proof, witnesses, id say take him to court.<br>  <br>  I feel like im missing something. You could probably ask another cop, in your case, probably in another station.<br>  <br>  Offtopic(sorry):<br>  Oscarg: how does monitoring cellphones have anything to do with this situation?? How do new laws in an effort to fight terrorism have anything to do with this situation? Do you even know what you're talking about? The USAPA has nothing to do with this situation. <br>  <br>  good guy:  you say you hate cops? if it weren't for them, your house would probably be robbed more often. You would probably be shot(more often then not), They're doing their job to protect you, and you hate them? what did they bust you doing something illegal??<br>  I know some cops can be corrupt, but you hate them in general?|`|kAwvPp0zaa	He doesn't have to prove he is a cop to arrest her. When a cop says that he is a cop, then he has identified himself as a cop. When she flicked her cigarette, she committed assault. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you only have half the story. Take a reality check and doubt everything that your daughter says; that's what good parents do. Children will lie to you at the drop of a hat, just like you did to your parents. Don't be so quick to defend her. <br>  <br>  Also, when she knocked over any other player on purpose, that was assault, too. Accidents happen on the court, but intentional fouling is actually a crime.

I found it difficult  particularly with an increased work load and I was told that the load was a temporary.

By making elderly people work means they have to pay tax money rather than receive it which would improve the economy and making fewer elderly people work damages the economy. <br>  <br>  Many jobs require training from employers which costs the company money end thus deprives the government of tax income. By exchanging existing employees for new ones the amount of training needed increases and thus the economy would be further damaged. <br>  <br>  At present income from pensions can be described as "poor" or "low" and to attain the level of "decent" would require more tax money which would further damage the economy. By lowering the pension qualifying age the individual pension income would have to be drastically cut in order for the government to afford to pay it essentially reducing the state pension below subsistence level.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	It's quite simple, once you have retired they only expect to pay you fo xyz years. 40 years ago someone retiring at 60 would have been alive another 10 years so for 45 years worth of putting money in they pay out 10. Since the age people are now dying has gone up and up they have to raise the age so they are still paying out 10 years max 15 years. Having to pay out this amount extra for an ageing population would financially work for every other benefit to come out of the same pot.<br>  It is a shame for those who can not afford to put away savings for retirement, but the prblem in doing so in this country is the moment you get your private pension they deduct what they have to pay you from the state pension you have been paying into for 40 years, so you end up with the same or slighly less than those who never saved anything.

There is no length limit in California for folding knives unless that knife is automatic or a butterfly knife (in which case they are limited to 2").<br>  <br>  The partial exception is Los Angeles. In LA, they have an unsual law that makes openly carrying a knife with a blade more than 3" illegal, but carrying concealed is fine no matter how large. Interesting, isn't it?<br>  <br>  People get CA's law mixed up a lot, like confusing the switchblade law as applying to regular folding knives, but it's not how it works.

scuxVXGMaa	China's defense spending, like China's economy, has been seeing double-digit growth for over a decade.  That does not mean that China will be overtaking the US as a global military power anytime in the near future.  There's a lot more to being able to project military power across the globe than merely possessing a larger, or modernized army.  China does, however, appear to be intent on projecting military might throughout the Far East - a subject of no small concern given China's territorial disputes with Japan, Vietnam, and the Philipenes, not to mention Taiwan.<br>  <br>  Since the early 1990s, China's air force has been undergoing a transformation from a 1960s era air-defense force, into a more versatile, multirole fighter force.  At the center of this transformation have been two aircraft: the Su-27, supplied by Russia; and China's indigenous J-10 fighter, which uses a Russian engine.  The Su-27 (together with its multirole derivative, the Su-30) has been delivered both direct from Russian factories, and in the form of kits, assembled at China's Shenyang facility under the label of J-11A.  More recently, China succeeded in producing a reverse-engineered copy of the airplane - without the supply of Russian parts - labeled the J-11B.<br>  <br>  The Su-27/Su-30/J-11 family of aircraft fulfill a role similar to what the F-15 provides for the United States.  The J-10, meanwhile, is expected to be produced in larger numbers, and fullfills a multirole air-to-air and air-to-ground function similar to the American F-16.<br>  <br>  China is also reported to be working on a next generation, stealth aircraft often referred to in the Western press as the J-XX.  Very little is known about where this new aircraft stands with respect to flight test or production readiness.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that China does not necessarily need to meet or exceed US weaponry and soldiers on a one-for-one basis.  The United States has many obligations around the globe.  China's most likely intention is to deter US intervention in any future conflict - or, failing that - to achieve a quick victory through overwhelming numerical superiority, before the United States has time to react.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about China's ongoing military build-up, the annual US Defense Department report on China is a good starting point.<br>  <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/china.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/china.ht...</a><br>  <br>  If you want to get serious about learning more, there are a number of reports on this topic put out by the Rand Corporation (<a href="http://www.rand.org/index.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/index.html).</a>  There was also a good introduction to China's air force modernization published in the British magazine, Combat Aircraft a few years ago:  "China’s Hidden Power: The First Half Century of PLAAF Fighter Aviation," Combat Aircraft (Vol 7, No 8, Sept 2006), pp. 56-61.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	no we are actually building FJ-35 JSF Lighting II's for them.

oKU7tFWyaa	Why have children if they can't be supported?  Look at the woman who now has 14 children in California.  She's single, unemployed, living with her elderly parents who are about to lose their home to foreclosure.  She is irresponsible in her decision to have children in the first place.  Her reasons were selfish.  She wanted to be a mom.  She believes that giving of herself alone is more than enough for those kids.  She can't afford them, and is begging for donations on the Internet to help support them.  She is human too.  Her mom and dad are as well as those children she brought into this world.  She made her bed, now she finds that she has to lay in it.<br>  <br>  No, I am not looking to cross into another country illegally.  That too would be for selfish reasons.  I think of myself as a better character than that, and would rather migrate to another country legally.  At least then I'd know I was welcomed in, and wouldn't have to be concerned with being deported if caught.<br>  <br>  Whatever happened to God provides where you are in desperate or dire situations?

AA10925759	I saw it. Apparently the US is seeking the names of over 50,000 people that they suspect of dodging taxes. The big news that one of the banks was that one of the banks has turned over 250 names.<br>  <br>  Since the Swiss economy is dependant on banking it is causing problems. Shares in a couple of the banks have already dropped bigtime. The fear is that US citizens will shift billions out of the banks. Other European countries are looking into taking the same action as the US under some kind of international treaty.<br>  <br>  I can't remember where I read it but something like a third of the money stashed in tax havens in the world is in Swiss banks. <br>  <br>  They already took a hit before with the whole resisting releasing the names of Jews who had deposited money around WW2 and never claimed it. They were keeping the money for themselves. <br>  <br>  Yes.... it should be interesting later when on the news some guy turns out to owe the IRS millions in taxes and interest. Someone is going to be the first poster boy for tax evasion. Since millions have probably been spent already in order to get the names they are going to slay somebody. I suspect that the Swiss bank gave up names of people who are the little fish. <br>  <br>  What I find interesting is when they have busted the super rich for taxes or some kind of investing fraud. You would think if you had say 250 million in ill gotten gains you would be smart enough to have an exit plan....... different passport, stashed money and say a house on a beach in some third world country.|`|cOYkCEZsaa	I did see some story about that, but people have been using Swiss banks in that way for years.
jrdtQi04aa	You are someone who is plain not into war is what you are.  You really should not question yourself.  You have the right to believe what you want in your heart, and you dont need to have the opinions of others to support you.  That's whats great about this country.  Now, I want to discuss this with you.  I think the war in Iraq is wrong, but I will always support those troops.  These are brave men and women who are laying thier very lives on the line in the belief that they are doing what is best for this country. Or at least they are following orders that they have been given.  Of course, not all of them think they should be there, but they do as they are told.  THEY are the reason we have the freedom to think as we wish.  Think about that.  Please dont say you dont support the troops.  You can not support this war, but the troops should be SUPPORTED. I think that you are a younger person, and some of your views may change in time.  I am a democrat, and I believe in law and order, and I believe in love for my country, and I believe that people have the right to choose how they live, and no religion has the right to dominate the country.  I am a Christian, and the one thing I know is that there has to be separation of church and state.  I have a right to my belief, however, all people have the same right.  Some believe, some believe something else, some dont believe in anything.  IT IS EVERY MAN'S RIGHT.  This stuff about liberals cand be Christian, is garbage.  Some of these racist, mean spririted, hateful people on this site who have the nerve to call themselves Christians need to be ashamed of themselves.  God's probably got some suprises in store for them on Judgement day for sure.  Good luck and please think about what I've said.|`|emce39Ooaa	You are a liberal and I think it's very hypocritical to be liberal and Christian. It's basically a contradiction. <br>  <br>  I read that you don't know where to stand on abortion and homosexuality, but it is extremely clear in the Bible that both are wrong.|`|Sdy2G97daa	you should probably just give up on politics.  it is clearly not your thing.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	i'd say you probably fit into the tinfoilhat party.<br>  <br>  here's the website:<br>  <br>  www.imanut.org<br>  <br>  <br>  anyway, do us all a favor, educate yourself on politics before you hit the polls based off of what you saw on a commercial (like so many did in the last election).<br>  <br>  but then, i guess you dont vote considering that the NWO decides who our president will be, and there's nothing you can do to change that.|`|Pk5NwUY1aa	I thought I answered this, but apparently not. So...<br>  I agree with you. You do sound like an anarchist. I know I am. I am a pacifist anarchist. I am both, independently. Though, ot does work out.The pacifist in pacifist anarchist neutralizes the anarchist which is a very toxic word that has a lot of misunderstanding. I do not believe in chaos, I'm against it. Anarchy and chaos can be synonomous, but anarchism and chaos are not synonnomous. You get a lot of people equating anarchism with violence, to say this is ignorance. More violence comes from single governments than all anarchists combined. I do seem to be an anarcho-syndicalist. Look that one up. There are many kinds of anarchists and anarchisms. Anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists, anarcho-socialists, and many others. Look up these anarcho-words, there is a person who recently made a video on youtube, had the idea of a anarchism without adjectives. In anarchy, all anarchist theories will be practiced, somewhere, and many places, at once. What John Lennon Imagined wilth be realized. There will be millions of communities in place of the hundredds of large powerful governments we have now. And, to quote Henry David Thoreau in "On Civil Disobedience":  “I heartily accept the motto, "That government is best which governs least"; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe--"That government is best which governs not at all"; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which the will have."<br>  As for you being a Christian, great Christians starting with the first Christian, Jesus Christ and Leo Tolstoy were Christian anarchists. Tolstoy referred to himself as an anarcho-pacifist, though, I prefer pacifist anarchist for the reason cited way up there. Pacifism is a much more effective weapon than guns and bombs. The government is justified when crushing violent revolutionaries any way possible. Kill non combatants, and you look like a, well, terrorist.|`|wNPFyl91aa	you sound like more of an anarchist. I really believe you are too confused to have an opinion. You believe in law and order but not the troops? I have a hard time believing that you are a Christian, stating that you have no opinion on gay rights and abortion, yet strong stands on anti war, troops etc. Can I ask how old you are to be so anti everything? I feel sad for you. You continue to have strong opinions and then say you don't know a lot about these subjects, i.e. NAU your whole idea of abolishing governments and their military. You are neither a Liberal Democrat or Conservative Republican.|`|gO1iAm99aa	You are a mess, a contradiction, and very indecisive.<br>  First off, pick a side or you'll be a statistic for both/all.<br>  If you don't decide for yourself, you'll be led, corralled, sheared and eventually slaughtered.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I'm not going to judge your beliefs as right/wrong.  I am simply going to give you an unbiased website that describes the basic beliefs of Conservatives and Liberals and it compares the beliefs held on each side of a variety of issues.

I don't know what I am either.  But it's not a bad thing.  You don't have to be a Liberal or Democrat or Republican or Conservative or Libertarian.  The only time you have to declare is if you're voting in a primary - you can't vote for more than one (in the states I'm aware.)   <br>  <br>  The Powers That Be would like to put us all into 2 camps, Right and Left.  It's the oldest trick in the book: divide and conquer.  Don't fall for it!  Spread the word.  Sooner or later enough of us will wake up and elect a great leader like Ron Paul.  You watch!
xh5EuJlbaa	It sounds like you support the idea of less governance. The idea of a smaller government has been the Republican mantra since forever, but it has never translated into reality as Homeland Security is a perfect example of. You seem to favor guns for all and law and order, which in my opinion is a gaping contradiction, but a valid point none the less. These are all Republican values. The difference is, you represent the values and the ideas that are being distorted and abused by the current politicians all around the country. <br>  <br>  You also seem to believe in protesting through civil (military in this case) disobedience, a classic leftwing approach to a problem. This is not an ideology but a technique.<br>  <br>  I dont think you should consider yourself to belong to any generalised group of thought, but if you want to label yourself, I would use the term reflected progressive republican.|`|vOZoihUlaa	deluded anarchist|`|2tBJT53Kaa	Well the soldiers that you don't support are defending your right to disdain them.  As far as 911, Osama planed it but the U.S. dropped the ball or made a poor attempt to prevent it.  Your pal Bill Clinton was too busy thinking of his johnson when they handed Osama on a platter.  How about your opinion on Pearl Harbor?   They wanted to enter the war with citizen support.  So the let the Japanese bomb Pearl.   Was it convenient that the aircraft carriers left before the bombing or just lucky?<br>  FYI:  congress approved the war (Democrat control)<br>  Raising the age to join the military to 21 makes sense or no combat duty until 21.<br>  As far abortion, you should only be able to do it once.<br>  Homosexuals should not marry.  If this is allowed then you should be able to marry anything.<br>  The problem with the arabs started with Carter.<br>  You say Bush is bad but Gore would have been worse.<br>  God help us with Obama.

How do you feel about the CCP? They have murdered millions in China yet they are our second largest trading partner after Canada.<br>  It's kind of tough to support law and order without government unless you expect everyone to just be happy campers everywhere all the time. And with law and order you too could be a criminal if the draft were ever reinstated and it might have to be if current trends continue. If we are attacked, not just one or two buildings, I mean ATTACKED our current military would we way out-gunned and out-manned.<br>  Ron Paul is a nut case who thinks doing nothing and letting our global banking system to "self correct" is the way to go even if it means billions starve through no fault of their own.<br>  I don't believe in a God, but will defend your right to believe to the death.<br>  I guess your one of those anarchist who want no government, but want all the benefits a government has to offer. Personally I would prefer the Republicans over your stance and I'm what many call a bleeding heart Liberal.<br>  Don't worry though. You WILL eventually grow up and figure out how things actually work and there isn't one damned thing you can do about it unless you strike it absolutely, fabulously, filthy rich or find a genie in a bottle somewhere.
9YzgrwoQaa	I heard that Kansas Colorado and Texas want to secede; they are forming there own county called KOTEX!! Don't worry about it, this has been a bad rumor since Abraham Lincoln.|`|CpTQagJOaa	They just want less federal government control in their state. They will still be part of the US.|`|wyXCRGv6aa	Full out seccession like the case in 1860-1861 where a lot of states secceeded because Abraham Lincoln won the election and those states formed their own nation called the Confederate States of America. In 1865 they were defeated and the C.S.A. was dissolved. Texas would be dumbasses to do that. No, my guess is that they most likely just want less federal presence there. Alaska governer and John Mc.Cain's running mate, Sarah Palin, wanted Alaska to secceed, from what I've heard. No, my guess is that they just want less federal presence.
e4Vtw35Jaa	i am not bothered. i am terrified. the man is taking power assigned to other branches of the goverment and assigning it to himsolf and people are not stamding up. first he tried to take power from the judicial branch now he is taking power away from congress. the us sensus is supposed to be run by a bipartisan commitie in congress but now is run by the cabinet. this will continue to happen till we stop him in 2012.   i was not as worried about bush because while he spent like a liberal he never stole power from the judicial branch or congress. he ubderstood what the executive branch did and thats all he did.|`|VoiJ73xfaa	Well, actually this spending plan is binding Obama.

Look that up, that was something to be concerned about. The fact that the president and congress could get together and do something that 70 to 80  percent of the people agreed with is no reason to be alarmed  What you should be alarmed about is that you can't see why most of the people agree that something needed to be done and it needed to be done quickly.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	It didn't bother you guys when Bush spent trillionS in Iraq.<br>  <br>  The $600 billion you're told about only covers the actual war operations.  It does not include the immense and exponentially growing interest rates that we were paying (and continue to have to pay since Bush never paid that down at all) on that $600 billion, nor does it include all that money we paid to the various tribes to stop killing us, nor does it include the $500 billion stimulus package we gave the Iraqis.<br>  <br>  All to hand Iraq over to Iranian control, because Nouri al Maliki (the Prime Minister of Iraq) is allied to Iran; as is his most likely replacement Moqtada al Sadr.  Oh, and to hand Iraqi oil over to China, which Nouri al Maliki did by signing the oil deals with them.<br>  <br>  We gave the money, the equipment, the time, and most of all the lives, and China gets the oil deals and Iran gets a new ally.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yet you guys did not say one thing about Bush, and some of you even insist that he was a great President who will be vindicated.

HOWEVER, that policy should be every bit as harsh on the scumbags that hire illegals for less then minimum wage to save money. For illegal immigration to even exist, it must be enabled. Someone has to hire them and pay them or they wouldn't bother to be here. That would drive wages up by cutting the labor pool somewhat. But, the jobs that illegals vacated wouldn't have high enough wages for your average American to support themselves on. <br>  A simple fine just isn't enough punishment. <br>  However, how would you feel if you met and married someone from another country and were told "Sorry, they can't immigrate after all. Sure, you payed thousands to get them here, you've waited for months to see your spouse, but, too bad, the economy went down the crapper thus your spouse can no longer immigrate."

There are many problems with allowing our borders to be over run by illegal immigrants: 1) the estimated cost to Ca tax payers alone is 9 Billion a year, 2) With the borders being opened there is no screening of the people that enter the country meaning that we could, and most likely do, have terrorist entering the country. 3) Illegal immigration drives down the wages in many businesses. The services, agriculture, and construction fields (largely filled by illegals) lag behind other fields in pay increases. 4) Most of the people who come here illegally do not have very good educations. This sets up a cycle of people who are not able to succeed financially and as we all know the poor usually remain poor if they are uneducated. The social and economic status is normally continued by the kids and grand-kids of the first generation immigrant. 5) Because of the inability of illegal immigrants to earn a living wage many turn to crime. This is why the illegal immigrant population in our prisons is disproportionate to their population outside the prison. <br>  <br>  There is no good reason to allow illegal immigration.|`|AA10476668	Our traitorous government continues to import about 164,000 immigrants per month, even right now, during the highest unemployment in a quarter century, even during this financial crisis. This is PER MONTH, not per year. Immigration Watch groups have pleaded with our senators and even Obama, but there has been no response nor reason given for continuing this policy. Big Business keeps asking for more H-1B visas for "special talent" while laying off equally talented Americans and filling their spots with lesser qualified (but CHEAPER) immigrant labor. This is all done lawfully. The greed of this country that our so-called representatives allow will be the cause of implosion and the main reason the U.S. goes under.

kH0IxFa9aa	In some States yes.<br>  This makes you an Independent Contractor, right?<br>  <br>  You are actually self employed, so yes they are valid.<br>  and you should have other work standing by. or not depend<br>  on that one job for income.|`|kAwvPp0zaa	Every valid contract has to have two parts: consideration and a meeting of the minds.<br>  <br>  Consideration means that you give up something in exchange for something. "I will work for you in exchange for pay." <br>  <br>  A meeting of the minds means that you both understand the terms of the contract (not reading it doesn't count). "I will work for you five days a week for eight hours a day for $5.00 per hour." <br>  <br>  A non-mutual contract is one that you didn't sign. A signed contract is a mutual agreement. That doesn't make it legal, though, but it is mutual. <br>  <br>  The one year part sounds like a non-compete clause; you won't work for a competitor for one year. Completely legal. They can still fire you, though. <br>  <br>  You gave up unconditional guaranteed pay in exchange for a 10 day guarantee for not working. Consideration. Legal. <br>  <br>  Sounds perfectly valid to me.
kAwvPp0zaa	Your chances are very good if you can prove abuse and neglect. All courts look for willing family members before putting kids in foster homes, though that's where she'll probably end up until your requests are processed. The fate of the child should always outweigh every other consideration.|`|ijDgKdcxaa	All you need are witnesses and you have a very good chance!  Call children's protective services and file for temporary custody.  Good luck!|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I am not sure that it is as easy as people think. <br>  One.. what you can afford/ not afford is not relevant. Courts cannot base custody on financial, since that could lead to kids going to whoever has more money. <br>  It is also wrong that if a child IS NOT HAPPY, that they can pick who they want. Parents have rights.. siblings or grandparents do not have rights to a child. A court HAS TO have proof that a parent is abusing/ unfit, in order to take their child away from them. NOT that someone else is "better" than the parents. If that were true, any kid in the world would be up for grabs in court by someone "better" (or more money). <br>  Between 2 parents with equal "claim", a court can rule on "best interest". When you go to what is called 3rd party, there has to be more reason, to overrule the rights of the parents, meaning a higher standard. <br>  The bottom line is that the parents MUST be shown to be unfit, with solid proof (not rumors, or child being unhappy). Moving alone is not proof of being unfit. <br>  Please, DO NOT misunderstand what I say. I agree it sounds not good for the child, and if dad is using drugs, that probably qualifies. I know you don't want to call cps on them, but that would probably be the way required. The reason.. cps is trained/ qualified to investigate any report. They also have to follow legal standards if removing a child from a home. Example..if the parent is charged with doing something wrong, cps legally has to tell them what it is..and also provide the opportunity to clean up their act, and solve the problem. ONLY AFTER the parent is given the chance to fix problems..and fails to fix them, then the state can file to terminate their rights. <br>  We might think the parents are not good (and probably right) but to legally take their rights away is more complicated than people think. <br>  By all means.. talk to a lawyer who can be specific on what the law is, in your state. It MIGHT be possible to get parents to agree to give you guardianship (not the same as ending their rights), which would be different than a court fight. <br>  If the bottom line is the safety of sis, cps could be the only way. Yes, they try to place kids with family when possible but that is not a guarantee.|`|Q4JCeVB9aa	Suggestion:   Would a reasonable discussion of how your sister is such an expense to your parents result in them willingly giving you custody?  Getting it done that way and having a lawyer draw up the papers for the court sure would be cheaper and less bitter for everyone.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, you can do it like others have said, but document EVERYTHING.   <br>  <br>  Lastly, be appreciative of that husband; he sounds like a keeper.|`|Mwi61tuFaa	you could get her....tell the judge whats up and then prove it buy witnesses and then show that your in a stable realationship and show bank statments showing you got money and then your golden..

6cSZV759aa	Veteran here to answer your question.  Basic training for lack of a better term "sucked".  The reason I say this is that the service attempts to take out the individual and assimilate that person into a collective unit.  There are some good things that come of this as mentioned in this forum such as helping other get up to speed with the rest of the unit; however, I personally would not do Basic over again.  There are a lot of good things that came out of Basic such as teaching everyone the necessary information to be successful in the service and giving everyone the "opportunity" to succeed.  The bad part is that 99.9% of the time you are set up for failure.  Your personal freedoms are equivalent to being a prisoner.  A lot of people after a period of time regain their individuality, while others retain the "gung ho" attitude from Basic.  I know for a fact the only difference between the non-commissioned officer me and the civilian me was the uniform and the tolerance for a lot of the service shortcomings.  Since I got out of the service, I now cherish the personal freedoms that I lost and I especially like the fact that I now actually have the ability to say the word "no" to someone that is at a higher level than I am at my job.  I understand that basic training is just one of those "check in the box" requirements that everyone must go through in order to serve this country, which is something that I will never regret doing.|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	Looking back, it was the best time of my life.|`|mr8isJoZaa	It wasn't too bad, pretty easy if you think about it.

AA11384465	PBS's Frontline did a 3 part series on this...<br>  <br>  I have mixed emotions and mixed opinions on what happened.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Chinese government went overboard in killing so many innocent students and if you know what really happened, they weren't just students. The protests had grown to a point of attracting many many other types of ppl.<br>  <br>  Now with that said, I am going to make an extremely unpopular statement/opinion. I am a marxist at heart and have studied the writings of Lenin in depth. Lenin, while a pacifist, knew that there were times to be use force to control mutiny.<br>  <br>  Lenin wrote about the ones that will try to overthrow the idealism of a fair and equal society... the ones that won't accept the weak having the same or the ones that won't accept a no class system.<br>  <br>  While I know this incident was not about that.. I do realize that this incident threatened the fairly new communist Chinese regime. I truly believe the Chinese regime would have been weakened had they given into the protesters due to the vast number and the length of the protest... not justifying the slaughter but saying I understand the stopping of the protest.<br>  <br>  In that Frontline series, the Chinese government warned them.. gave them days to leave... they chose to stay. They chose their destiny.|`|AA10169377	Beach bum your answer amazes me<br>  You said." Yes, the Chinese government went overboard in killing so many innocent students"<br>  So my conclusion should be it is perfectly acceptable for the government to kill some but not to many to retain power? This from the same person who calls for the abolishment of of the patriot act as it infringes on our right to privacy. I guess it's better to be deprived of our most basic right to live than lose ones privacy I am stating to see your reasoning<br>  <br>  You said- "I am a Marxist at heart and have studied the writings of Lenin in depth"<br>  Since no Marxist state has ever evolved past the dictatorship of the proletariat. Again i understand  Genocide is a time honored tradition among dictatorships throughout history<br>  <br>  You said -"I do realize that this incident threatened the fairly new communist Chinese regime. I truly believe the Chinese regime would have been weakened had they given into the protesters due to the vast number and the length of the protest.<br>  You neglected to say that the new reform govt did fall and the hardliners took control. So your premise of protecting the current "new" Government as justification is false.  The truth is the corrupt hardliners were protecting their privilege and power. Which I must concede is perfectly understandable in a dictatorship of the proletariat  or of any other type.<br>  <br>  The truth is young lady that you, like Marx, are so blinded by ideology that you fail to see that China is neither Marxist or communist but make excuses and apologies  because they claim to be. Yet you are the first to battle when any perceived infringement  no matter how minor is made by your Own government. You condemn your own government for infringements of freedom while supporting the same thing in China.

cWuumdy7aa	With the proportional representation system several members of parliament are to be elected per constituency. Basically every political party presents a list of candidates and voters can select a list, that is they vote for a political party. Parties are assigned parliamentary seats proportionally to the number of votes they get. <br>  <br>  Basic Idea<br>  Political parties play a key role in creating political solutions (even in a majority election system). A reasonable number of competing parties will create more and better ideas while just two big parties (resulting from the majority election system) tend to be at a deadlock with inflexible positions. <br>  <br>  Characteristics, Pros and Cons<br>  With several parties there is more choice and voters are more likely to find a party that does represent their major political convictions than would be possible in a two-party system. <br>  Supporters of a small party are likely to be represented by at least one member of parliament rooted in their region and sharing their political views and convictions. <br>  The size of constituencies is bigger and there are less possibilities to manipulate their borders than with the majority election system. Usually the borders of the constituencies are fixed by historical considerations (provinces, federal states, counties etc.). As several seats are assigned to parties proportionally to votes even within a constituency, the borders of a constituency are not as relevant to the election result as in a majority election system. <br>  With an increased number of represented parties a majority for a single party becomes less probable. If the government must be based on too many small parties they may disagree when new issues emerge. This may become a danger to political stability and cause anticipated elections absorbing the attention of politicians. If instability gets notorious in a country, the state as a whole will just not be able to perform the tasks it should. <br>  Small parties may also abuse their position to get support for special interests (for examples subsidies for institutions related to the party) in exchange for support for the government policy. This is nothing less than a form of corruption. <br>  In most countries with proportional elections the parties decide who will represent them in parliament. There may be a difference between the party hierarchy deciding on the top places on the party's list of candidates and the voters preferences. <br>  In some countries, there are additional rules to make sure that voters may have some influence which candidates will represent them. <br>  The most sophisticated system of this kind has been established in Switzerland: Voters may replace candidates on a party list by other candidates (even from a different party) and favorited candidates may appear twice on a list (while the total number of candidates on a list may not exceed the number of seats, of course). For those who think this is too complicated for them there is always the possibility to use an unchanged party list. This way, a major drawback of the proportional election system is eliminated while preserving the obvious advantages of proportional representation. (For details see: Switzerland's refined proportional election system)|`|ofP7bbX7aa	It depends on who draws the maps.

I needed a good laugh today, and the reading of your question provided it.<br>  <br>  I enjoy stumbling upon those obscure (to me at least) sections of the CVC which I rarely find application for.  Plus I couldn't help but wonder if the officer could have truly thought that the pedestrian was "as big as horse" so therefore thought the use of that section was applicable.<br>  <br>  You are correct, The section you cite as being listed on your ticket reads just as you state.<br>  <br>  From what I can guess, the officer probably meant:  21950(a)VC - The driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to<br>  a pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection, except as otherwise<br>  provided in this chapter.<br>  <br>  Courts have ruled that a typographical error made on the part of a law enforcement officer does not - in itself - negate the intent of the officer, which was to issue a valid citation for an observed violation.<br>  <br>  Obviously, if you pay the fine then the violation stands as cited, and the officer will probably never know that he listed the section incorrectly on your citation.  Plus, you will have the honor (and certain amount of uniqueness) of being one of the rare few who can rightfully claim that you were cited for "failure to yield to a horse" in downtown LA!<br>  <br>  If you choose to contest the ticket and appear in traffic court, the officer would have to appear and testify to his or her honor as to the mistake, and the section the officer intended to cite you for (that may also be a good story to tell around the table next Thanksgiving!)<br>  <br>  In any event, it certainly wouldn't hurt for you to try and contest the citation.  <br>  <br>  No matter what the outcome (and I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful) I think this is a win-win situation for you - if for future story-telling alone.<br>  <br>  Oh, and congratulations for this being your very first traffic infraction citation.

sFGMNGlQaa	it was part of so called The Stargate Project|`|AA10404097	The Stargate Project was one of a number of code names used to cover "remote viewing programs". Others included Sun Streak, Grill Flame, Center Lane by DIA and INSCOM, and SCANATE by CIA, from the 1970s, through to 1995. It was an offshoot of research done at Stanford Research Institute (SRI).<br>  <br>  The research program was launched partly because some intelligence officers believed a 'psi-gap' had emerged between America and the Soviet Union, citing, for example, the abilities of Nina Kulagina.<br>  <br>  Remote viewing attempts to sense places or events are normally performed in the present, but sessions have also been undertaken to sense the past and future.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  The Stargate Project<br>  The Stargate Project created a set of protocols designed to make clairvoyance a more scientific process, and minimize as much as possible session noise and inaccuracy. The term "remote viewing" emerged as a generalised short hand to describe this more structured approach to clairvoyance.<br>  <br>  The project was eventually terminated, according to the official report at the time, because there was insufficient evidence of the utility of the intelligence data produced. In 1989 new civilian administrators, unfamiliar with CRV protocols, had brought in "witches," tarot card readers, and channelers, thereby, it is argued, deteriorating the quality of the project's data.<br>  <br>  In 1995 the project was transferred to the CIA and a retrospective evaluation of the results was done. The CIA contracted the American Institutes for Research for this evaluation. An analysis conducted by Professor Jessica Utts showed a statistically significant effect, with gifted subjects scoring 5%-15% above chance, though subject reports included a large amount of irrelevant information, and when reports did seem on target they were vague and general in nature. [1] Professor Ray Hyman concluded a null result. Based upon both of their collected findings, the CIA followed the recommendation to terminate the 20 million dollar project.Time magazine stated in 1995 three full-time psychics were still working on a $500,000-a-year budget out of Fort Meade, Maryland, which would soon close up shop. [1]<br>  <br>   Key project personnel<br>  Major General Albert Stubblebine: A key sponsor of the research internally at Fort Meade, he was convinced of the reality of a wide variety of psychic phenomena, leading him to even attempt to walk through walls. In the early 1980s he was responsible for Army Intelligence, during which time the remote viewing project in the army began. Some commentators have confused Project Jedi supposedly run by Special Forces primarily out of Fort Bragg with Stargate. <br>  Ingo Swann: Swann coined the term 'remote viewing' as a derivation of protocols originally developed by René Warcollier, a French chemical engineer in the early 20th century, documented in the book Mind to Mind. Swann's achievement was to break free from the conventional mould of casual experimentation and candidate burn out, and develop a viable set of protocols that put clairvoyance within a framework named “Coordinate Remote Viewing” (CRV). <br>  Patrick Price: Price was a remote viewer during the early part of the program. <br>  Joseph McMoneagle: In the early 1970's McMoneagle reported a a near-death experience which gave him psychic powers. McMoneagle has stated that remote viewing ability is predominantly determined by innate talent. <br>  Lyn Buchanan: Buchanan was a sergeant brought in by General Stubblebine for two main reasons: firstly extraordinary telekinetic abilities, and secondly computer software expertise. These made him exceptionally well-qualified to be the database manager for the Stargate project. In this role, Buchanan had the opportunity to work with all the key members of the unit, and in possession of statistical analysis of the session data, was able to properly assess the accuracy of the session data obtained. After leaving the forces, Buchanan founded "Problems, Innovations, Solutions", contracted Mel Riley to work for his company, and continues to undertake private tuition. <br>  Mel Riley: Riley is an army Sergeant who retired in 1991. Riley was noted for being able to describe what lay under objects in aerial photography. In 1984, the CRV unit had only several trained remote viewers, and Riley was requested transferred to the unit. Riley was featured in the documentary released in 1995 by the BBC titled "The Real X-Files." He has recounted past life experiences as a Native American, and continues to be involved in native American culture. <br>  Paul H. Smith: Smith is a retired U.S. Army Major and intelligence officer. Smith was one of the five people trained as a prototype test subject in Ingo Swann's psychic development of the CRV protocols in 1983. Smith was later assigned to work part time in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s remote viewing unit. He was the main author of what is known today as the “CRV Manual”. Smith, having natural artistic abilities, produced impressive CRV session sketches. He always preferred to remote view in the blind, being tasked with CRV coordinates by a project manager. <br>  Ed Dames: Dames was one of the first five remote viewers who were trained by Ingo Swann in the Coordinate Remote Viewing protocols. He quickly established a reputation for pushing CRV to extremes, with target sessions on Atlantis, Mars, UFOs, and aliens. However, Joe McMoneagle has expressed the opinion session feedback is required to learn CRV, and this could not be obtained when targeting such unverifiable locations. Mel Riley arranged a fake session in which a description was given of Santa Claus coming over the North Pole in his sleigh (Schnabel). Dames said the object over the north pole was a nuclear attack, and was set to call the highest levels of the military, before he was informed of the prank. Internally, his reputation never recovered. <br>  David Morehouse: David Morehouse entered into the DIA's Remote Viewing unit in 1987. Despite being designated by his superiors as “Destined to wear stars,” he resigned his commission in 1995 after his decision to write Psychic Warrior—his resignation ended eighteen years of exemplary and honorable military service. He is the director of David Morehouse productions, and his company has trained 15,000 civilians in Remote Viewing Techniques.<br>  <br>  The Epsilon Team (In Greek: Ομ?δα ?ψιλον, Omadha Epsilon) is a persistent rumor concerning a secret society consisting of an elite team of Greek engineers, academics, pilots, powerful businesspeople and politicians etc. manufacturing and piloting UFOs and supposedly working for major international forces or even secretly ruling the United States of America. Its status or actual existence is considered to lie halfway between a conspiracy theory and an urban legend.|`|Voh4gZfXaa	What the frig are you talking about?

Their entire economy is now based upon others buying their products. Go into bad relations with the US or any of our allies, and their entire economy comes crashing down. Our economy, on the other hand, is capable of being self-sufficient because we already have the means and were so in the past. The Chinese on the other hand like many Asian countries were a primary farming country that has now changed. A lack of demand for product could disrupt the lives of millions. The chance of a missile attack: very low. The have missiles that can reach Denver successfully: the only missile that can reach Denver is a ballistic cruise missile that has to go into lower earth orbit to reach that distance, a missile that is outside the atmosphere can easily be dealt with because of the fact that it performs no controlled burns once it is in orbit, and can be intercepted easily.|`|AA11370204	N O!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11847350	aceman it only takes one missile and china has some that can reach as far as Denver.

2a1adba2fe6682ab98cb37b30a021596aa	Ja ja, me da risa muchas de la respuestas como si el problema de la inmigración Mexicana a los E.U. fuera tan sencillo y fácil que por decreto el gobierno lo solucione,  pensar eso es como querer curar un cáncer con una aspirina. De entrada eso es cultural muchos se van por necesidad no porque el gobierno los invite a irse, otro motivo es porque mucha gente tiene familiares y amigos que ya están allá y por lo tanto le parece menos difícil la decisión, el choque cultural se aminora al conocer a alguien allá, por ultimo yo he conocido mucha gente que se va por ganar mas, incluso conocí gente que se ha ido teniendo trabajo aquí en México y tomo la decisión por darle mejor vida a su familia.<br>  <br>  Aun cuando México estuviera mejor en Materia económica la migración no pararía, por que siempre E.U. estaría mejor y por lo tanto seguiría siendo atractivo para muchos, es decir para que esto terminara México debería tener una economía mas grande en proporción con la americana y teniendo en cuenta que E.U. es una potencia esto realmente se ve muy difícil para México y cualquier otro país.<br>  <br>  Si lo anterior no fuera cierto dime tú, entonces porque los Chinos que ha crecido su economía tanto en los últimos a?os, siguen expulsando personas a E.U. y muchos otros países incluyendo México. Se cree que en México viven mas de medio millón de Chinos.<br>  <br>  Esto es un fenómeno mundial no solo de México, sin embargo en México es mas notorio por su cercanía con la mayor potencia hasta ahora en el mundo, simplemente quisiera ver cuantos hindúes habría en E.U. si la India estuviera en Norteamérica o cuantos argentinos o brasile?os si estos países se ubicaran por arriba del Ecuador, creo que este fenómeno solo lo puedes comprender siendo en primer lugar Mexicano y segundo teniendo amigos y familiares cercanos viviendo eso.|`|AA11671634	quien te dijo que los envian ? yo pienso que cada quien elige su propio camino informate primero|`|LY1fKNWIaa	No conozco ningún caso especial en el cual ,Mexico mande a la gente si no que por lo que he visto y vivido la gente se va ,por puras ganas,y en parte gran necesidad,como todos los latinos.|`|3df0dbab311c22eef443e4f20712cd65aa	Porque el gobierno de Mexico es inepto y corrupto y no tiene la menor idea de como ayudar a su gente.

Esto demuestra lo mucho que se preocupan por su gente. Aquí en los Estados Unidos hacen trabajos que ni los Negros Americanos realizan(palabras del Presidente Fox en una conferencia) Que orgullo Mexicano hablar así de su gente, que buen Mexicano es Vicente Fox y todos los que se expresen así y no vean el da?o que esta ocasionando a Mexico este escape hacia el Norte, solo piensan en $$$.|`|AA11828295	Mexico no los manda.

A lot of people forget that daughters, mothers, and wives are dying over there too. Jessica Lynch is a woman and she was captured and tortured. This war is pointless, we invaded another country, stole their leader, (an evil dictator, there's no doubt, but he was still the leader of a sovern nation) and our leaders thought the whole deal would be over in a few months?

I realise that the reason we went there was in search of a nuclear weapon - which does not exist.  The thing is though, it could have and if we did not go then we would be criticising the governments for not doing anything about it.   Besides the evil man that Sadam Hussein was, it was only a matter of time before he had one.   It is awful though that the soldiers are there, I really want them to come back home, even though it could be argued Iraq is in a terrible state and many innocent Iraqis die everyday.   However the point is they die everyday anyway, whether coalition forces are there or not.   Bring the troops out and stop coalition forces bloodshed.   Get George Bush out of power as well, he is just as much a terrorist as Osama Bin Laden.    He’s a selfish fat cat with the blood of thousands of Iraqi, British and American troops and innocent people on his hands - the sad fact is, more and more people will die as a product of this war for many years to come.   There is no solution to stopping the death caused by this war, more and more hatred is being caused and more and more people are dying.

8ad6fQiNaa	Abraham Lincoln had a similar quote about how the nations greatest strength is it's ability to issue currency, and that if we allow another to take that ability, we've sold our nations security to another. I have the real quote somewhere, but I'm way to lazy to try and find it right now, I just woke up.|`|RjUhISEIaa	TJ was smart but to say he was ahead of his time...don't know. The quote given could apply to any time/any where that financial institutions have been around. He was fortunate enough to put it in writing for us to reflect on in our now troubling times.<br>  <br>  NOTE to "Relax I'm here now" and your response. You are incorrect in your assumption that this is an issue where people cannot handle their financial responsibilities. The Clinton administration relaxed the regulations on Freddie Mac that allowed what can only be considered preditory lending. People took out home arm loans at a ridiculous low rate that ended up escalating to rates that was above their income level. You cannot fault the people for taking these loans to buy a home. Yet they had no idea how high the rate on the note would go and guess what...they didn't stop going up and therefore led to the foreclosure mess we have on our hands now. Therefore, the line in TJ's quote that "the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless" holds true with our current economy.|`|tmer08ZQaa	I don't see how the banks of today are 'depriving the people of all property...'.<br>   Todays banking problems are a result of poor personal financial responsibilities.|`|F3DDgXVKaa	Wow, apparently not only did he have a taste for Black women, but he had a pretty good "feel" for economics too|`|um87XJvmaa	Yes.

9FCxm8qJaa	Biden -won the debate.  He answered the questions (and Palin did not - rather she just spouted off her talking point regardless of the question asked) and was generally accurate on his facts.  His experience and good view points came across.  She didn't screw up as much as she did with Katie Couric, but her portion of the debate was simply memorized lies and trying to be cute.  She's a real loser!!<br>  <br>  No way,<br>  No how,<br>  No McCain,<br>  No Palin!!!!! |`|M9ApBTYvaa	Biden of course.  Although the repubs appeared to be very happy that Palin didn't give another performance like hers with Katie Couric, she wasn't debating at all.  She didn't answer the questions and the whole time either gave her resume over and over and over and over again, or simply began talking about something else entirely such as energy. She's a joke.|`|lkeeiW38aa	Biden won. Joe Biden's answers came from his vast experience while Sarah Palin's answers came from last minute text-book studys. Joe was able to communicate to the people with ease showing how a McCain/Palin adminstration is more of the same past 8 years. I never heard Palin take on Biden directly on that when he made that claim perhaps because she knows its the truth?<br>  <br>  Why didn't Palin say "Hey joe your wrong on that.." Looks like McCain is more BUSH...|`|LvVlkQhDaa	They both streatched the truth... go to <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/factchecking_biden-palin_debate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/...</a>|`|AA10356921	Biden...I loved the virtual *****-slap "bridge to nowhere" jab he made early on!

Anyone with a brain knows that.|`|AXjwFoFxaa	idk.<br>  <br>  DEMOCRATTTTTTTS!|`|EjrqJAlsaa	Biden<br>  <br>  If you can't see that then your blind my friends. Anytime Biden brought up a topic or a detail of a topic that wasnt CRAMMED into Palin's head before the debate she froze up and repeated what she already stated. The Iraqi war evacuation policy was a great example. She didn't present an exit strategy and once Biden laid his down on the table she replied with "uhhhhh... pulling our troops would be a white flag..." which doesn't sound like an exit strategy to me. theres more examples|`|Sx9VSwRMaa	Biden, because I thought that Palin was not answering the questions that were asked and she was playing up the down home act a bit too much with the winking and aww gee whiz.  Biden's answers were a bit winded sometimes but he answered with substance and not just talking points.|`|iuKLqiCqaa	Biden...his answers left me with no fear if he were to win VP<br>  <br>  With Palin, not only do I not agree with her & McCain but it made me more afraid of if McCain died when VP<br>  <br>  Did anyone else notice that about 4 times she said being a Mom prepared her to be VP. Nothing against moms but that scares me.|`|FfAjB0Hdaa	id say biden because he actually answered the questions he was asked!|`|GUXQlCMPaa	I think palin avoided questions but biden lied so I say they both kinda suck.|`|jca3OKiaaa	Palin definitely!

Palin was very bimbo like.|`|trMsK86jaa	You can't win by default.|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	Biden won hands down. He's totally qualified and trustworthy.<br>  <br>  Palin did not go out a loser as she repaired her reputation as totally unqualified. The perception was partly a result of prior poor interview performances. So the Republicans saved face and indicated maybe this is not evidence that McCain didn't make a bad decision in his choice of running mate.  She refused to answer questions.   It would be frightening and dangerous to have someone as unqualified and controlling as her as VP.|`|scp6N1slaa	Palin<br>  she was high energy and could relate to Americans.  She didn't try to use fancy lingo that only scholars and politicians could understand.  Also, I think she won because she kept up with Biden and that is tough considering their different experience levels.  She is doing surprisingly well for being a newbie at this.|`|AA12020119	I don't have to think. Palin talked generalities and had no substance. Biden took McCain apart.<br>  <br>  The poll's say Biden won by a large margin. I agree with them. I watched the debate, twice!|`|W8hvEmFlaa	Can we stop talking about this yet??

20289b38692a9d70b4bf93451fe6e31faa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo, independientemente de que muchos de nosotros luchamos dia a dia para mantener nuestra soberania como ciudadanos y superarnos constantemente, esta claro que el gobierno y la sociedad provilegiada hacen todo lo posible por acaparar la riqueza de este pais, donde la clase baja y media baja es la mas perjudicada, donde la clase media alta se conforman con las sobras que les dejan los ricos y presumen de ser una clase trabajadora, como muchos usuarios que aqui ingresaron su comentario que presumen de ser inteligentes y conocer de historia, cuando realmente son ellos los que carecen de objetividad y vision.

Difícilmente un país no tiene problemas, del tipo que quieras, delincuencia, inseguridad, pobreza, marginación, desempleo, crisis sociales, economicas, politicas y religiosas en determinado momento y en menor o mayor grado.<br>  <br>  Bajo tu punto de vista, entiendo que nadie no nada mas los Mexicanos somo independientes, es decir, en Canada siendo un pais de "primer mundo" también son esclavos de un régimen tributario, lo mismo pasa en Japon, en China (por la explotación del hombre por el hombre, por ello avanzan a pasos agigantados).<br>  <br>  Aun asi siempre defendere tanto tu derecho como el mío de expresar lo que pensamos, para eso hay libertad, ?no crees?.

2fRLEuzRaa	Sinceramente, n?o me pareceu antiético ou antiprofissional. Antiético e antiprofissional foi e continua sendo a forma como a maioria esmagadora dos jornalistas, seja da imprensa majoritária, seja da chamada imprensa nanica, fizeram e fazem a cobertura dessa nefasta invas?o ao Iraque. Nem um décimo dos crimes perpetrados pelas for?as armadas dos EUA e seus aliados foram divulgados. Houve e há uma total conivência entre os EUA e a mass midia. <br>  Até hoje, muitos ainda tentam justificar os inomináveis crimes de George Walker Bush. Muitos ainda se referem a Saddam Hussein de forma rancorosa, querendo mais vingan?a como se eles mesmos ou seus parentes tivessem sido vítimas de alguma arbitrariedade determinada por Saddam. Mesmo Saddam Hussein tendo sido perseguido e preso de forma humilhante, sem que qualquer direito de chefe de Estado e de Governo lhe fossem reconhecidos, sem que seus direitos como réu igualmente fossem respeitados, pois foi julgado diante de um tribunal ilegal, porque seguiu normas extraordinárias - que só valeram contra Saddam Hussein e seus comandados - a maioria ainda se refere a ele de forma rancorosa, como se eles mesmos ou seus parentes tivessem sido vítimas de alguma arbitrariedade determinada por Saddam. Continuam a se deixar envenenar por mentirosos contumazes, como já mostraram ser n?o só os membros da administra??o Bush, mas igualmente dos governos que ao norte-americano se congregaram.<br>  Nesses oito anos como presidente, George Walker Bush zombou e n?o reconheceu os direitos n?o só do povo iraquiano e do afeg?o, mas de seus próprios conterraneos e comandados. Hoje, centenas de milh?es de pessoas já foram vítimas dos desmandos de George Bush: oficialmente, o número divulgado de soldados americanos mortos varia entre 4128 a 4139; o número de feridos, chegaria a 30.182. Para uma guerra cujos idealizadores - asseguraram - seria “limpa” - isto é, com um número de baixas inexpressivo - esse número pode ser classificado no mínimo como “perturbador”, para n?o dizer alarmante.<br>  Muitos n?o compreendem que o tribunal criado para julgar Saddam Hussein foi o conhecido “tribunal de exce??o”, muito comum em estados ditatoriais. Mas n?o foi para implantar a - democracia - no Iraque que se procedeu a invas?o àquele país? Esse tipo de “tribunal” é instituído em flagrante desobediência aos princípios da igualdade e da legalidade - que devem orientar um regime democrático. O tribunal que julgou Saddam Hussein teve todos os ingredientes de um “tribunal” ou “juízo de exce??o” como, por exemplo, imparcialidade do juiz, direito de defesa, contraditório, e, todos os demais princípios relacionados ao devido processo legal. <br>  Se submetido ao mesmo “tribunal”, George Bush, Jalal Talabani (líder curdo e, desde 7 de abril de 2005, atual presidente “testa-de-ferro” do Iraque) e Nuri al Malik (desde a mesma data, primeiro-ministro “testa-de-ferro”, iraquiano) igualmente, seria condenado ao enforcamento.  N?o o ser?o porque o alegado “tribunal” só se formou para julgar Saddam Hussein, seus ministros e colaboradores. Assim, realmente fica muito fácil se fazer passar por um líder democrata e sem qualquer acusa??o de crimes contra a humanidade.<br>  Numa verdadeira democracia, a lei para ser justa tem de ser geral (porque se destina à totalidade ou à maior parte de um grupo de pessoas), abstrata (pois n?o se dirige a qualquer ato ou fato concreto) e irrestrita (se o indivíduo, n?o considerado inimputável, comete ato determinado na lei como crime, n?o pode ser imune às penas legalmente impostas). Porque lei que é feita para um único e determinado indivíduo é casuísmo - seja para favorecê-lo, seja para prejudicá-lo.<br>  Podemos citar como exemplo de casuísmo para beneficiar um dado indivíduo, a lei brasileira que ficou conhecida como “Lei Fleury”, pois foi elaborada para favorecer o delegado Sérgio Fernando Paranhos Fleury. Este, caíra nas gra?as dos militares que comandavam o país durante a ditadura por ter estado à frente da opera??o que matou Carlos Marighella. Como o promotor Hélio Bicudo, mesmo sofrendo terríveis press?es e intimida??es, conseguiu reunir evidências suficientes para o indiciamento daquele delegado, e a lei da época ordenava a pris?o automática dos indiciados, foi criada a “lei Fleury”. Esta lei instituiu o princípio da presun??o da inocência que impede a pris?o do réu antes do transito em julgado, se fosse primário e tivesse bons antecedentes. O claro intuito foi o de beneficiar aquele delegado.<br>  Exemplo contrário, isto é, a institui??o de um tribunal para julgar um determinado grupo de pessoas, foi o que vimos e continuamos a ver no Iraque “democrático” de Bush.<br>  A rigor, Saddam Hussein jamais deixou de ser presidente do Iraque, pois a sua “derrubada” se deu n?o pela a??o do povo iraquiano, único a deter o poder legal e justo de eleger ou derrubar um governo: Saddam foi deposto pela for?a militar de países estrangeiros, que passaram a tratar Iraque n?o como uma na??o independente, que realmente era, mas como uma simples possess?o dos EUA e Gr?-Bretanha. O que prevaleceu neste episódio foi a lei da for?a - e n?o a for?a da lei - como deveria imperar - se - o Iraque houvesse se tornado uma democracia legítima.<br>  Estados Unidos e seus aliados, desconsiderando completamente o Iraque como na??o independente, arrancaram de suas legítimas posi??es as autoridades políticas eleitas pelo povo iraquiano, para colocar em seus lugares os testas-de-ferro da administra??o norte-americana e britanica. <br>  Sinceramente, depois de George Walker Bush ter reinventado a pirataria de Estado, o terrorismo estatal; de ter perpetrado tantos crimes contra a humanidade, ter feito uso de armas de destrui??o em massa, ter usurpado todas as riquezas do Iraque, ter reimplantado o plantio de papoula no Afeganist?o para permitir a bilionários norte-americanos e europeus continuar a se enriquecer com o tráfico de heroína, morfina e ópium; depois de ter patrocinado a trucida??o n?o só de centenas de milhares iraquianos e afeg?os - mas de norte-americanos e de nacionais de todos os países aliados dos EUA nessa invas?o; de ter propiciado a invalidez permanente de tantos jovens norte-americanos e de tantas outras nacionalidades - achar que arremessar-lhe sapatos é “crime contra chefe de Estado estrangeiro”, foi antiético e antiprofissional - é simplesmente reafirmar a covardia, a injusti?a e a ilegalidade.|`|1d4871eee4571dbc530fbaa7a2c818dcaa	Achei legalzinho... se fosse aqui e quisessem atirar alguma coisa na Geni iriam encher a Geni de bos.ta... se for no "homi"... acho que bos.ta é pouco... eu, por exemplo, jogaria uns dois Sarneys, uns dois ou três Zes Dirceus e umas Marta Suplício...umas Ideli Salbosti... uns Mercadantes e outros coc?s de sucesso do partid?o...

Al principio trataron de comprar esos territorios pero ante las negativas de vender provocaron la guerra.<br>  Por cierto habia una campana llamada "all mexico" (todo Mexico) que promovia la anexion de todo el territorio mexicano, La unica razon por la que no aceptaron la otra mitad de Mexico es que a diferencia del entonces norte de mexico que estaba muy poco poblado, el sur estaba lleno de indios, ellos no querian mezclarse con esta raza inferior y tampoco les gusto la opcion de exterminar a todos esos indios pasando a la historia como genocidas, asi que optaron por solo quedarse con el norte.|`|o5w0o1Bvaa	Aprende a escribir.

TFAi8bdXaa	Los nazis eran nacionalistas, efectivamente, en el sentido de que compartían el sentimiento de que Alemania estaba por sobre todo, pero atención, para los filósofos alemanes de la época, como Spengler, ser socialista era básicamente obedecer al Estado. Era un nacionalismo estatalista, racista, xenófobo y militarista.<br>  O, en palabras de Rosenberg: "Nosotros pensamos con la sangre"|`|LRbxal5Faa	Es un concepto sobre-usado para evitar buscando los males actuales. Había bastantes políticos malos en América Latina más recién que la segunda guerra mundial (los a?os 30 y 40) que nadie recuerda por uso de este termino.

Solo para decir que no debemos negar nuestro propios problemas por una historia de otro continente, cultura y/o siglo.<br>  <br>  Un socialista pueda ser nacionalista. Socialismo es un partido. Nacionalismo es una lealtad a su patria.|`|2b77683b432664a2d4794d74676d2e16aa	De nacionalista tiene el fuerte sentimiento por hacer valer la Patria por encima de cualquier cosa y de poner los derechos de los nacionales (alemanes) por encima de los derechos de cualquier inmigrante. Es una filosofía ultra conservadora que rechaza la inmigración, la fuerza de trabajo extranjera y propugna por fortalecer las costumbres nacionales evitando "contaminarlas" de las foráneas.<br>  <br>  Socialista porque en apariencia le daba prioridad a las necesidades y bienestar de sus nacionales y a elevar su nivel de vida.  Por eso practicaban la xenofobia, porque se oponían radicalmente a que quienes mejoraran su nivel de vida con la economía alemana fueran los judíos.|`|421a9233893aaa0cfc0daf41fa5d90b9aa	de socialistas sólo tienen el nombre|`|b60ecd45920bb520d756d6e66d9280dcaa	Atenea contesto correctamente.

Fue una confusión, inicialmente los que crearon este partido querian hacer un partido socialista, pero Hitler y su gente se adue?aron del partido a punta de trancazos y no le cambiaron el nombre, ellos no lo fundaron, el  Nazional Socialistische Arbait Deutche Partei o Partido Nacional Socialista de los Trabajadores Alemanes era todavia mas derechista y ojaldra que el PAN.

All Democrats and all the ideas they have are wrong, regardless of the facts.<br>  <br>  Even if the stimulus plan works, they will lie and say it doesn't.<br>  <br>  One way to prove this is to show the equivalence between monetary policy and fiscal policy. Both can be used to reduce output during inflationary times or increase output during recessionary periods. Both use changes in aggregate demand to do so. Yet, Republicans are fixated on monetary policy (except for the far right ones that want to go to the gold standard) and say fiscal policy is socialism and won't work. <br>  <br>  In fact, if fiscal policy didn't work, either would monetary policy.<br>  <br>  A consistent Republican position would be - yes, a fiscal spending plan can work but has certain costs that monetary policy doesn't have.

So, why didn't our Government give room enough for the markets to work themselves out??|`|3UTlASavaa	The actual performance of the economy may improve and that will certainly have an impact on my vote.  On the other hand, the high-handed, "we won, so bipartisan means that you agree with me" arrogance of the administration HAS to be toned down and the opposition must be given some credence.  Of course, it is not required to get items passed but it is required to get my vote.  We do not live in a despotism, even one of the majority.  Democratic voices were heard and honored during the past eight years.  For the past month Republican voices have not mattered, even when they represented the clear will of the people (more than 60% of the electorate did not want the stimulus to pass).  The administration must find a way to work with that.|`|AA11828439	Yes! If he is still the best candidate he will get my vote again.

I think I'm well aware that making murder legal under technicalities is not ethical, and I sure as crap think that if the Government handed NASA's work over to corporate entities, we'd have Starbucks on Mars as of 4 years ago.

When a pardon is recognized, consider your slate WIPED CLEAN. and you are good to go...<br>  <br>  The other method to get in; rehabilitation. Which is more complicated.  But basically, since DUI is an indictable offence in Canada; to be deemed rehabilitated you must wait 10 yrs, so this is probably not an option for you.<br>  <br>  I would like to help you more, but I have some follow up questions, you can contact me at this blog: <a href="http://canadian-immigration-info.blogspot.com/," rel="nofollow">http://canadian-immigration-info.blogspo...</a> so we can look at this issue a bit closer.

d5zEYomEaa	As a lifelong Republican who no longer likes the direction they are going in, I think things will get MUCH MUCH worse under McCain. He's already made it clear that he wants to invade Iran!!!!!! That will draw Russia and many countries in and create a WWIII. At the very least, the record deficit Bush created will get even worse, the record inflation will continue to rise until we are dirt poor, which is their goal anyways. <br>  <br>  They didn't like how we the stupid people they control, were starting to have some  money/control and suddenly tightened things up and now they are pretending unless we are ok with CEO's getting a 700 billion dollar "bail"/hand-out that things will get worse. Pchuh, I'm not that stupid to vote more of this cra***p. I'm not buying his pathetic attempts to pretend he's some third party unassociated with the party he actually belongs to, who is screwing us over as we speak!!!!!!!! And having a female on the ticket won't make me want to swallow the above BS and turn my money over to them either, as if it's softening the blow and succeeding to brainwash me that it's a good deal.|`|dfa0f10d091f9f82c584408f50df66a8aa	Better than Bush. They don't have the same ideas at all.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the drive by medias misrepresentations calling him Mcsame.<br>  <br>  That's just propaganda and trickery to try to sway voters. Mccain proved himself last night.<br>  <br>  The economy isn't dependent on the next President it matters what's going on now. We will gain more seats in the House so that will definitely hep our economy because some decisions can be made.<br>  <br>  Right now Congress majority is Dems and therefore Bush has had to fight tooth and nail to get them to agree on anything.<br>  <br>  I can't wait for Mccain to get in office. |`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	People are not voting for Mc Cain, they are voting against Obama. The polls are not showing what's really going on. Obama may be more popular, but Mc Cain will get votes, because some people just can't stand the idea of a left wing windbag as President.  The love affair will grow colder over time. Obama has been deflating since his statement about "clinging to guns and religion". Also Obama may have done well in the last debate, but the debating is not over, and Mc Cain is a good debater. Obama's problem right now is that he has loose cannon VP Joe Biden. He's been running his mouth off all week.|`|e5d537b994128155cca5d85bcefa98edaa	worse<br>  <br>  Obama/Biden '08|`|sEQpTml2aa	If you listen to him it will only get worse, and we will be frighting with Spain...lol   but that's what he said.|`|37c5d5ea68afc6eafba3ec965f004b95aa	Watching the debate made me think he has the right ideas for what's wrong with the country.He made a good point about the tax cuts for big business.If they pull up stakes to go to cheaper countries then we're screwed.This is the greatest country in the world and we should do what we have to tokeep it that way.|`|8bISKi4maa	McSAME wont do anything different, we doesnt even know what to do when he wakes up in the morning bc the Alzheimer is kicking in and god help us if palin has to step in, the country is gonna be burned to the ground by every other country,. thank god i live in toronto now|`|twvFi8emaa	The last thing that John McCain wants is war,,he has seen It first hand and I believe he will do whatever it takes to aviod it.|`|QlJ5SC9taa	A retarded zombie would be a better president than Bush.

People say Bush is a terrible president, but due to the events that faced America during his term, there is no way to know if another candidate would have done better. For all we know, Bush saved the country and was actually a great president, or he could be have been the cause of its downfall. No point in playing the "what if" game.<br>  <br>  I am not an economic genius, but I do know for a fact that the economy has very little to do with the current president. Most presidential actions take several years to take effect. The economy during the next president's term will be a reflection of Bush's actions. <br>  I honestly don't know if it will get better or worse. But I am hopeful that there is light at the end of the tunnel.|`|aSF7s6Lpaa	look at his record . he is not afraid to try change but he uses wisdom. not all change is good. i think with his mind set he will change things he has too. Bush had not the experience that McCain has. so yes he will do much better than Bush ! It is good to look at the whole person and ask questions and do the best you can to vote for the right person it is your choice nad country!|`|gcxITuJvaa	the economy isnt bad cause of bush, its bad cause banks are giving loans to people who cant pay them back, he wants to finish the war that we started cause if we pull out of the war right now the outcome of that will be terrible and everyone who died and fought would have done it for nothing. we are making huge progress right now there, bush should have done things different but whats done is done we have to work with what weve got. i do think he willl be better then bush and i do think he will be better then obama.|`|msm2PbNwaa	well i think that anyone in the senate will be a better president than Bush.  I dont know politics well enough to give a valid argument but I  know that I cant stand McCain.

Go OBAMA!|`|AA11095417	Ask the stock brokers and everyone who works on Wall Street who they're voting for and you'll know.

Phil Gramm was the co-architect of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 1999 that deregulated the banking system.  We for over 70 years have had a stable banking system until Gramm F- it up.  So, would you choose Gramm as your economic adviser?  If not, what does that say about McCains judgement?|`|qKg979tVaa	Yep, he's the right guy for the job.

An evil dictator who killed thousands of his own people with biological weapons, horribly disfiguring thousands of others including but not limited to WOMEN AND CHILDREN, has now been extinguished. His maniacal evil rapist killer children have been extinguished. In the process Al-Queda has come to us OVER THERE instead of on our soil. So now we kill terrorists on foreign soil after removing an evil dictator. THIS IS BAD? ARE YOU NUTS? And now you stand up for a SOCIALIST BIGOT.  STOP DRINKING THE KOOL AID!!

Moreover, she stated that whites in America were “ineradicably racist”.   The 1985 thesis, titled "Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community" was written under her maiden name, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson.  <br>  <br>  Michelle Obama stated in her thesis that to "Whites at Princeton , it often seems as if, to them, she will always be Black first..." However, it was reported by a fellow black classmate, “If those "Whites at Princeton " really saw Michelle as one who always would "be Black first," it seems that she gave them that impression”. <br>  <br>  Most alarming is Michele Obama’s use of the terms “separationist” and “integrationist” when describing the views of black people. <br>  <br>  Mrs. Obama clearly identifies herself with a “separationist” view of race. <br>  “By actually working with the B lack lower class or within their communities as a result of their ideologies, a separationist maybetter understand the desperation of their situation and feel more hopeless about a resolution as opposed to an integrationist who is ignorant to their plight.”<br>  <br>  Obama writes that the path she chose by attending Prince ton would likely lead to her "further integration and/or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society; never becoming a full participant." <br>  <br>  Michele Obama clearly has a chip on her shoulder.  <br>  <br>  Not only does she see separate black and white societies in America , but she elevates black over white in her world. <br>                                     <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is another passage that is uncomfortable and ominous i n meaning:<br>  “There was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community, I am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the black community first and foremost. “<br>  <br>  What is Michelle Obama planning to do with her future resources if she’s first lady that will elevate black over white in America ?<br>  <br>  The following passage appears to be a call to arms for affirmative action policies that could be the hallmark of an Obama administration.<br>  “Predominately white universities like Princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments.”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The conclusion of her thesis is alarming. <br>  Michelle Obama’s poll of black alumni concludes that other black students at Princeton do not share her obsession with blackness. But rather than celebrate, she is horrified that black alumni identify with our common American culture more than they value the color of their skin. “I hoped that these findings would help me conclude that despite the high degree of identification with whites as a result of the educational and occupational path that black Princeton alumni follow, the alumni would still maintain a certain level of identification with the black community. However, these findings do not support this possibility.”<br>  <br>  Is it no wonder that most black alumni ignored her racist questionnaire? Only 89 students responded out of 400 who were asked for input.<br>  <br>  Michelle Obama does not look into a crowd of Obama supporters and see Americans. She sees black people and white people eternally conflicted with one another. <br>                                                                                                 <br>  The thesis provides a trove of Mrs. Obama's thoughts and world view seen through a race-based prism.<br>  This is a very divisive view for a potential first lady that would do untold damage to race relations in this country in a Barack Obama administration. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Michelle Obama’s intellectually refined racism should give all Americans pause for deep concern. <br>                                             &nbs p;              <br>  Now maybe she’s changed, but she sure sounds like someone with an axe to grind with America . Will the press let Michelle get a free pass over her obviously racist comment about American whites?  I am sure that it will.  But it shouldn’t. <br>  <br>  I am definitely sick of the main stream media (MSM) feeding us all this crap about Obama being an agent of change.  <br>  <br>  Has anyone stopped to think what kind of change; really? <br>  PS: We paid for her scholarship.|`|B28m1qalaa	Shhh...we're not supposed to see that White pundits got the memo:  Scream about Wright and race so people don't realize the economy has collapsed and that the Neocons want young men and women to die for oil.  Here's a few puppets of right wing think tank's marching orders:<br>  <br>  Lou Dobbs said Obama was pandering to ethnocentric ideas because he accepted Gov. Richardson's endorsement.  But Dobbs never said that when the white governor of Virginia endorsed Obama.<br>  <br>  Pat Buchanan said blacks should thank whites for Slavery since they have done so well in America.<br>  <br>  Rush Limbaugh says white students at Chapel Hill should now be afraid of blacks in baggie pants.  Doesn't he know that young white men wear those pants too?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/80560/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/80560...</a>|`|G4lSjOAMaa	What else are they going to attack him on?<br>  <br>  The Wright scandal was Obama's biggest mistake, the Republicans are never going to let the American people forget this.|`|K1CIABjBaa	No, don't look at my church. Nothing to see here. Let me play my sooooothing flute for you.|`|T1RJdn2Oaa	I dont worry about his church, I worry about him being a liar, racist and anti american. I think that is reasonable..... but Demonrats are worrying about it too, let see about half,  the Hillary half.|`|VnjKoYhKaa	I am not worried about his church.  Once all of America is aware of what went on inside, how Obama stayed their for 20 years of hate speech, anit-american diatribe and publication of materials from fugitives allied with Hamas orchestrated by his closest spiritual friend and campaign advisor, I think there is no longer any reason to fret.  Give the people the information and let them decide.|`|Vgf4Rlt8aa	As soon as You realize that it isn't only Republicans worrying about Obama's church.<br>  <br>  This is not a partisan issue.<br>  <br>  Obama supporters<br>  Clinton supporters<br>  McCain supporters<br>  <br>  ...and the rest of America had to try and understand why Obama put himself in this situation.  It is appropriate to ask questions about it and be concerned considering that He is running for the highest office in the land.<br>  <br>  If it wasn't such a big deal then Obama would never had made a speech or denounced Wright's outrageous rants.|`|hXwqKidraa	Probably never. Personally I could care less about his religion.  You want to focus on some real issues? Not a problem. Why does Obama buy into Marxism?  Tell us about Obama's vast experience in Foreign relations.  How does he intended to pay for his Marxist universal health care plan? What part of the Constitution supports that hair brained idea anyway?|`|mB6P7nfZaa	never ..we will use it until he fails..its good stuff
UspK4SQBaa	While it's too late to file charges, you could still file for sole custody, IF it's in your child's best interest.  I suggest you speak to a family lawyer about this.  I would think that it's certainly NOT in the best interest of a child to live with a pedophile rapist. <br>  Good luck, Sweetie.<br>  <br>  P.S- I hope the family court judges in your area are nothing like this one: <a href="http://www.newsok.com/xml/rss/1868461/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsok.com/xml/rss/1868461/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: There is no reason to be embarrassed Honey.  I know how you feel.  Trust me on this one.  However, if you had filed charges, you would not have been "putting his father in prison"  You would have been doing your civic duty.  He put himself in prison, and forcing your sperm into a woman's body does not make you a father.  I expect your son would resent this man if anyone, although he still may want to know him later on.  Most sons would have a violent hatred for anyone who hurt their mother.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Um, I would call the police. I would have called the police about 12 years ago.
YupMCYHlaa	He didn't look at Obama.  I don't know why that was. Obama would look at him but he refused to make eye contact with him.  I think that hurt him, maybe a little.<br>  <br>  McCain has the reputation of having a vicious temper.  I don't know if it's true or not but it's something you hear about him. It really looked like he was afraid to look at Obama or he'd lose his temper.  That's how it looked to me anyway, like he was just simmering and trying to keep himself in control.<br>  <br>  Obama looked much more comfortable, much more 'in his element'.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	He was pissed off and hardly could control himself. He looked more like  an angry monkey than a president|`|AA11280073	The poor old coot was trying to remember his name.|`|AA11369432	 He had hopes that no one would notice...and  we did  didn't  we.|`|mvVhbY1Gaa	Sophie... He didn't have a look off into space look he just chose to look at the moderator . I believe he did this  to not come off as aggressive to further promote the speculation about him having a temper problem. When you look at someone it invites them. I think McCain took more of a let him bring the argument to me approach. I didn't think either of them put on a spectacular performance. I thought it was ok or mediocre.|`|l02Huqdlaa	Think about it. He had nothing to challenge him and I suppose he was bored. To listen to Obama would be like trying to have an adult debate with a kindergartner altho that would have been more exciting.|`|QElj3flFaa	As a public speaker I have points of focus and it is possible that McCain was just trying to not look at Obama... plus he was probably just taking in what he is saying. |`|AA10761951	McCain has a problem with temper control.

mSFjbetxaa	Obama has my vote.<br>  <br>  Here is why:<br>  <br>  Obama passed legislation with Republican Senator Jim Talent to give gas stations a tax credit for installing E85 ethanol refueling pumps. The tax credit covers 30 percent of the costs of switching one or more traditional petroleum pumps to E85, which is an 85 percent ethanol/15 percent gasoline blend.<br>  <br>  -After a number of inmates on death row were found innocent, Senator Obama worked with law enforcement officials to require the videotaping of interrogations and confessions in all capital cases.<br>  <br>  -His first law was passed with Republican Tom Coburn, a measure to rebuild trust in government by allowing every American to go online and see how and where every dime of their tax dollars is spent.<br>  <br>  -Obama created the Illinois Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families in 2000 and successfully sponsored a measure to make the credit permanent in 2003. The law offered about $105 million in tax relief over three years.<br>  <br>  And...<br>  <br>  -Obama joined forces with former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon (D-IL) to pass the toughest campaign finance law in Illinois history. The legislation banned the personal use of campaign money by Illinois legislators and banned gifts from lobbyists. Before the law was passed, one organization ranked Illinois worst among 50 states for its campaign finance regulations. <br>  <br>  -As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Obama has fought to help Illinois veterans get the disability pay they were promised, while working to prepare the VA for the return of the thousands of veterans who will need care after Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  -He traveled to Russia with Republican Dick Lugar to begin a new generation of non-proliferation efforts designed to find and secure deadly weapons around the world. <br>  <br>  -Obama has been a leading advocate for protecting the right to vote, helping to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and leading the opposition against discriminatory barriers to voting...<br>  <br>  And...<br>  <br>  - In the U.S. Senate, Obama introduced the STOP FRAUD Act to increase penalties for mortgage fraud and provide more protections for low-income homebuyers, well before the current subprime crisis began. <br>  <br>  -Obama sponsored legislation to combat predatory payday loans, and he also was credited with lobbied the state to more closely regulate some of the most egregious predatory lending practices. <br>  <br>  -Barack Obama introduced the Patriot Employer Act of 2007 to provide a tax credit to companies that maintain or increase the number of full-time workers in America relative to those outside the US; maintain their corporate headquarters in America; pay decent wages; prepare workers for retirement; provide health insurance; and support employees who serve in the military.<br>  <br>  And...<br>  <br>  -Obama worked to pass a number of laws in Illinois and Washington to improve the health of women. His accomplishments include creating a task force on cervical cancer, providing greater access to breast and cervical cancer screenings, and helping improve prenatal and premature birth services. <br>  <br>  -Obama has introduced and helped pass bipartisan legislation to limit the abuse of no-bid federal contracts. <br>  <br>  -Obama and Senator Feingold (D-WI) took on both parties and proposed ethics legislation that was described as the "gold standard" for reform. It was because of their leadership that ending subsidized corporate jet travel, mandating disclosure of lobbyists' bundling of contributions, and enacting strong new restrictions of lobbyist-sponsored trips became part of the final ethics bill that was signed into law.|`|9xltuXkiaa	NOT MCAIN.. <br>  <br>  cus he's a psychotic insane lunitic.. who barely fakes sanity..<br>  <br>  did u see the debates? holy crap that guy is a monster.. waiting to kill us all...<br>  <br>  so.. not mcain.. <br>  <br>  but doubly so.. not only cus he is just more bush.. more disastser.. more looting and bankrupting of america..<br>  <br>  but cus the guy is dangerous.. he will destroy the world if we give him the power..|`|6iRrlATraa	McCain.

They will at least split making it close or republicans will take them all allowing them to walk off doing the funky chicken.

I'll make a prediction. <br>  <br>  Obama/Biden 08   I think many people are very upset with what the Republicans have brought us. They had the leadership roles for 6+ years. |`|e3av6sY0aa	I truly believe that obama will win because Americans are disgusted with eight years of bush and realize that mcsame would just be more of the same failures.|`|3WINphDEaa	I believe Obama will win mostly because of the effect mass media has on society. Almost every instance I have seen of Obama has been positive (with the "pig" comment being the exception). Also I just think that people will believe the republican party will drive us farther into a state of war and economic crisis.|`|IA1h4V9gaa	I think most people are unable to separate the two.  I hope I am better at it but admit I am biased like anyone else.<br>  <br>  I guess McCain wins 52-47-1 (1% others).  I know it goes by electoral college votes, but I bet the result is similar to 2004.<br>  <br>  Let me explain why.<br>  <br>  Other than his association with Bush, the democrats have found very little hard stuff to criticize about McCain.  They have actually spent the last 8 years telling us how great he is for opposing many Bush initiatives.  Most of the things he voted for (i.e. war in Iraq) are the same things democrats voted for.  <br>  <br>  Obama to them is exciting but their faith in him to be able to pull off what they want out of him is shaky.  Not his ability to be president - but his ability to be the kind of president they want.  <br>  <br>  I have no doubt the country will survive either way.  <br>  <br>  Now, this whole economics issue is currently perceived as being all Bush's fault and some extend that (somehow) to McCain.  This has hurt his numbers.   But those few % are the fickle few who change on a dime and can easily go back the other way.<br>  <br>  You might also notice that polls pre-election ALWAYS are more favorable to the democrats than what actually comes out of election day.  Why?  The democrats lose a few percent to college students and young people who just forget or don't care to go vote.  The rural republicans SHOW UP.  SAYING you will vote for a candidate is not the same as actually doing it.  <br>  <br>  In the end, I think it will be pretty much neck-and-neck down to the wire, and that few % will put McCain over the top, as Obama voters either find something good on TV or just simply lose their nerve with him and go with the less exciting but more predictable McCain.|`|6EztfzkEaa	Obama.  Simply put, he is what the country really needs right now.  McCain had people when their main focus was the war.  He's good at that.  The economy was an issue, but not something that was in the majority of america's face.  Now that this economic situation is at hand, and not only Obama, but McCain and Bush making it known that this is equally, if not more important to America right now, Obama seems like the safer choice.  McCain has never seemed like the economy was his cup of tea, or his strong point.  Obama has show a great deal of concern over the economy since day 1, as well as the underlying idea that we are stretching ourselves thin militarily and financially in Iraq.<br>  <br>  Obama is the better choice, and I think he will get the nod in Nov.|`|i0R3OxgCaa	Honestly McCain, for the simple reason most people know Obama's economic plan of raising taxes even on the 250K lot & up put's a big burden on small businness owners who are currently strugling to surive in this current economic crisis. <br>  <br>   As for the supper rich they pay very little taxes because they have there tax laywers find every loop hole to get them out of paying top dollar.<br>  So in the end it will be the little guy who really pays higer prices for every thing from food to gas, <br>  I'm not in love with McCain but he seems to have a better grasp of what needs to be done.|`|AA12218954	Who do I want to win - Obama<br>  <br>  Who do I think will win - well, I thought that McCain was going to walk away with it after the RNC.

XryJTPN4aa	In CO for most misdemeanor charges I can choose whether to arrest or issue a summons.<br>  <br>  A summons, is basically a ticket which lists the charge, and the court time. By signing the summons, the offender is promising to appear in court.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sometimes if the offender is an asshole or has a history of not appearing for court, I will arrest them, thus making them bond out prior to court.<br>  <br>  If the crime is domestic violence and/or a felony its an automatic arrest.

Rest in Peace, Nichole.|`|gihARhlaaa	Care factor zero.|`|AA11373993	Who cares????<br>  He's finally going to jail!!!|`|HSyyNuaTaa	no they have concrete evidence and they have his voice on tape|`|T8xPrB3maa	NO WAY!|`|wjBOEUMUaa	Lol.. no way!|`|Ih0lVZIpaa	HAHA!! ..no (sry) :'(|`|9ilXVowLaa	no-i lived in Vegas when that all went down. no way.|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	Yes, it is possible but he was going to get sentenced this time no matter what.  
AA11176387	well, they say once a cheater always a cheater and if he can call her a c word, he could cheat on her..<br>  <br>  not sure but he admits cheating on his disabled wife, apparently for several years with others and with his current wife.<br>  <br>  Yes, cheaters are adept at lying...he also admits in the CNN interview about his infidelities admits lying about his age when he, in his 40s went after someone nearly 20 years younger and then laughs<br>  <br>  I lost all respect for him this week after reading the story of his first wife and then the whipping up hatred with lies and finally the way he attacked during the debate last night.<br>  <br>  I want to campaign for Obama cause I now despise McCain and do not want to see this guy get in.|`|FcZU29W6aa	It certainly would affect my opinion of a man if he cheats on his wife.  I am just about sure John F. Kennedy cheated on his wife, yet I feel he was a great President.  Supposedly Roosevelt cheated on his wife and I liked him too.  So, I guess I would look at other aspects of the man and then decide.  By the way, I am an Obama/Biden supporter, so I am not just sticking up for McCain.|`|f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	If you waited for somebody perfect to come along before you voted for them then you'd never vote for anyone. Cheating does not actually break any laws however distasteful it might be.<br>  <br>  What is more depressing is how the USA elected a scoundrel not once but twice. Lying about WMDs that never existed has cost thousands of lives and there are more every day.|`|AA11214871	And Obama being with the gay guy that suddenly died was not cheating? Hmm... another demobot double standard.<br>  <br>  A lot of women have had their pics taken with BOTH candidates, does that mean anything? NO and I do not believe your "friend" had an affair with McCain either. More kool-aid induced crap.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	A penis goes in a vagina.<br>  That statement was true before America or Politics or the Bible.<br>  I think sex is important.<br>  Since I can no longer partake in boinking, I salute anyone capable<br>  of getting an erection.  <br>  McCain's weenie like Bill Clinton's has nothing to do with running a country.|`|TeTKYAG0aa	He still has my vote!|`|YjMgCrp4aa	That's a personal matter and would not have any weight in my decision making process. However, there are a whole host of different reasons I wouldn't vote for McCain. He was involved in the Keating Five scandal. He voted against the MLK holiday. He chose Sarah Palin as his running mate, despite her lack of experience and qualifications, which jeopardizes our country in the event he is elected President and is not able to perform his duties. He has flip flopped on numerous issues and can't seem to get his stories straight. He has disrespected Senator Obama on several occasions, which shows a lack of dignity on his part. I could go on, but I think it's pretty clear that McCain is not presidential material.|`|AA11947878	well the country stood behind Clinton, Kennedy.....you name it. Being faithful and being a politician don't seem to mix.<br>  <br>  I suppose his personal life, even though I may not approve, should not sway his inability to lead a nation, no matter what candidate we refer to.<br>  <br>  |`|POygTyTAaa	I will not vote for him because I do not share his views, and I don't believe he is smart enough to run the country.  I do not think he has any real thoughts of his own.|`|AA12243338	I'm not voting for McCain, but my reasons have nothing to do with his personal life.  I think the issues facing America are too important to get distracted by stuff like this.|`|h9xSKgiJaa	Yea. Bill Clinton cheated but he was a great president. Personal life and affairs are irrelevant to the presidential position.|`|Y0rFpnTWaa	Bill Clinton did awful things and he was voted in.<br>  Even if McCain did bad things, so did Obama.<br>  <br>  Obama = OBAMAnation.|`|3MgLsIsXaa	The man that has never lied or cheated may throw the first stone.<br>  Oh there is no one to throw the first stone |`|ldwboUnkaa	WOW a politician who lies!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5fb5a855a7ba040448a4d2ac98374a7baa	I guess you will be forced to one way or another.<br>  <br>  If I am to believe your story, then I will have to believe the story of the gay may who stated he had an affair with obama, who was mysteriously murdered.<br>  <br>  So, if you are voting for obama because of that one reason, you may want to rethink it.|`|EM6Lmvkiaa	For some strange reason don't think I need to be worrying about other people's very personal business that I don't have any interest in anyway. I didn't think the Monica affair was any of my business either. So I'll vote for who I think is the better choice for President. <br>  <br>  You've certainly put to rest some questions about McCain's health though.|`|TNIrW2UZaa	No, and I didn't vote for Clinton either.|`|MuFtSFoFaa	That wouldn't matter to me. But considering I'm not voting for McCain anyway, then I don't care one way or the other.|`|KXboD7u1aa	Yes, clinton did, right?|`|xJBzW8WJaa	umm... right... <br>  <br>  Im voting for McCain-Palin no matter what!

Excellent Service.  |`|4Ej32YBfaa	Postie Here - Going by what happens at my office the before 9 am specials go out by drivers and can be delivered as early as 7.00am.  The normal ones (before 1pm) unless the are too big are taken by the walking posties and would arrive with your normal mail but obviously they should get a signature.<br>  <br>  If done by a van the times on the before 1pm ones would vary as they get all the Specials for a particular area and they also have to do the large parcels as well.<br>  <br>  There fore earliest time could be as early as 7.00am on a before 9am Special and any time after 9am for the rest.

XKvpZm3Jaa	im thinking you got with someone and he told you his rank and first name.... but weird you only have his first letter of his name. how do you findout.. well there is no place you can just type in that info and find people and people arent just gonna release that stuff. best luck is to find him where you met him.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Well, you can't call up the Army. They don't give out that kind of information.<br>  <br>  Do you know any of his friends? Do you know where he works? Track him down that way, but please - don't stalk the poor man. If he wanted to stay in contact with you, he would've made sure you knew more than his rank and the first letter of his last name.|`|FsBUKc1vaa	google...myspace....|`|9rhmeb7raa	You don't. You need the complete name and $3.50 to obtain his current rank and military mailing address from his branch's locater service.|`|9ev0bBoeaa	You can't basically. Unless you do some major Myspace stalking and not every soldier has a MySpace. Don't you think if he wanted you to know where he was he'd would've told you.|`|AA10613848	You don't, the odds of finding someone (the right one) with just that info is slim to none|`|QceqkcIxaa	yes you can. but he must be a member of the armed services, not just a fake. it should work as long as hehas set up a buddy finder for his name. go to military.com and join for free. then, at/around the search box you will see buddy finder, pretty self explanitory after that. good luck. and next time, get their whole name
srtlm9Ptaa	I'm in South Carolinaaa tooo :]<br>  <br>  I guess you can.  What the heck? Just do it!<br>  Maybe they'll let it slide.<br>  <br>  :]|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	You CAN because you are free to do any fool thing you want.<br>  The question is: "Should you?"<br>  Yes, it's a vote of conscience because you think he's be better than either of the major party candidates.<br>  The problem is that he has NO chance in hell of winning and voting for him means that you increase the likelihood that the least desirable of the major party candidates gets into the White House and really screws things up.<br>  <br>  It's a terrible thing that third party candidates rarely have a chance to impact elections in the US.<br>  Doesn't happen.<br>  Even Nader in 2000 in Florida. Nothing. Nada.<br>  They did some polling and studies following that election and found that the Nader voters would NOT have voted for Gore. Never. Ever.<br>  They were voting FOR Nader and if he had not been on the ballot they would have stayed home and not voted.<br>  <br>  So your best chance of affecting this election is:<br>  1) add your vote to the least objectionable of the major party candidates. (even if he loses)<br>  2) write in Chuck Baldwin (will make no difference.)<br>  3) stay home |`|AA11642883	I'm amazed he didn't make it on the ballot, but yes I think your vote will count, it might not show on the paper the next day (if your paper like mine shows all the listed candidates in the state and their votes), but the poll workers will count it.  Not sure if it is a voting machine, if they allow write in, but I would hope so.<br>  <br>  Okay, given the answers posted while I was writing that, I guess they don't count in South Carolina.  I'm sorry if it offends anyone, but that is a silly rule, if you want to vote for Mickey Mouse, you should have your vote for Mickey count.|`|7d3d6055f9dc6ecc99ef3bac91624614aa	Yes, you can. But as a conservative, I have to tell you the honest truth. If you vote for Chuck Baldwin, it will be like giving your vote to Obama. Third party candidates do not win, that's just the facts. Only once in history has any third party candidate won. But about the "writing in" of a person on the ballot, you could write in anyone you wanted to. |`|gGGhC8yEaa	Write-in votes are not allowed in primary elections or the election of President or Vice-president in South Carolina.<br>  Sorry.

RD5sTZaFaa	You really should check with an attorney in your state.  I would think you can deny the arrest if it was expunged, but if the background check turns it up you will be thought a liar by the GA Bar, and you would probably be deemed unfit to practice law because you are not honest.  It may depend on the felony charge, if it is not a violent crime, or a crime of moral turpitude you might be better off coming clean on the application.<br>  <br>  If this were in my state I would tell you that the charge will be available for a background check by the State Bar, even if it was 20 years ago, unless you were found not guilty, and later had the arrest expunged.  If you served probation in Texas you cannot get it off your record, although some lawyers thought that you could and told clients that the record would not show up.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|RjUhISEIaa	The best answer is an honest answer with an explanation.<br>  <br>  However, you may want to consult with an attorney to find out the facts instead of asking for it here w/ us layman. My father was a Federal judge and I grew up around the legal community and this one is tricky. If they don't find out while conducting the background investigation you get the clearance. If they do, and it should have been disclosed to them, you don't. <br>  <br>  As for the GA Bar Association question I give the same answer. Sealed records do not to the best of my knowledge have to remain sealed in the interest of national security. Again, check with an attorney for they will have the answer you need.
nJ0MRH24aa	Supreme Court Justice Souter refused to delay the election, or take Obama's name off the ballot due to the failure to produce proof in a court of law last Friday. However, he did set a Dec. 1 deadline for Obama to do so. After that the Supreme Court will be expected to take "remedial action". Since there is no precedent for someone who has not been proved a natural born citizen, to have delegates elected to attend the Constitutional Convention in December, "remedial action" could be just about anything.<br>  <br>  At that time, Hawaii claimed to have a valid original birth certificate for Obama, but would not say if it was a birth certificate showing he was born in the USA, or one showing he was born somewhere else and registered in Hawaii.<br>  <br>  Kenya (where his very recently deceased grandmother claimed she witnessed his birth) froze all of Obama's records until "after the election".<br>  <br>  It is unknown what will happen on Dec. 1, but Obama is not yet elected. Presidents are elected at the Electoral College. The Nov. election was only to pick delegates to be seated at the Electoral College.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Yes, by 63 million US voters.|`|36c480701058b660a79a7f09780e1b33aa	I'm sorry.. obviously I missed something..is this a joke?|`|9QhUzgLmaa	Nope...and probably won't be because leftist judges are protecting him.|`|wCy1iTsGaa	Not Yet!!!!!  he has till January to prove it or he's history.|`|ad559ef88f939f9d26d9af2103d73f95aa	Not yet.|`|AA12200777	Obama's campaign produced a seemingly valid copy of a Hawaiian birth certficate; however, there are some that conclude that it could not possibly be valid. <br>  A law suit is pending but the campaign was working on getting it dismissed. The attorney filing it merely wants Obama to present a copy of it, but he will not. <br>  I would think that someone would have validated it in order for him to run for president so I doubt this thing will go anywhere. |`|517awyMJaa	Are you serious? I must have missed something, because I haven't heard anything about it! Hmmm... if he hasn't, there is something fishy going on. |`|cqVU2IjWaa	it never will be verified but it doesnt matter because laws mean nothing to powerful people in this country.  it is sad, because one day a few greedy people will cost all of us.|`|HwlBgOEraa	Yes, I read that it was verified like two weeks ago.|`|6806f37ee86620c2e1983e5f36afb283aa	LOL..

dJnRFpWWaa	Buy firearms, eat more junk food, always speed while driving, go to church every Sunday but try to screw your fellow man the other six days of the week, and listen to talk radio to sharpen your reflexive condescension toward people who are just as imperfectly human as you are.<br>  <br>  Or you could just be yourself and stand out in the same ways that you stood out when you were living in Australia. When Americans embrace foreigners it isn't because they have changed to fit in, it's because they have brought something to the table that we may consider refreshing, or exciting, or stimulating or any number of other adjectives. But in some way it speaks to the feeling that you are genuine and not an artificially constructed personality.<br>  <br>  I may not have put that exactly right, but I hope you understand the gist of the comment, which is intended to be uncritical of your motives but skeptical of your aims. Be yourself. That should be everything you want to be.|`|AA10045620	Just be yourself and adjust slowly.  You will probably stand out, but in a good way.  Just by saying hello to someone you will open more communication about where you are from and such.  It is okay to be different.  All will smooth out in time.  Best wishes.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	I don't really know we are pretty laid back for the most part, and your going to stick out because of your accent not in a bad way.|`|eLMLZcc1aa	you are obviously crazy to have moved to the USA from Oz so you should fit it just fine...<br>  <br>  sorry  but Oz is an amazing place with great people and way of life, not saying the states aint i just couldnt resist the jibe.<br>  <br>  seriously like the previous answer stated, be yourself you should not want or need to change to be accepted by others.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your life in the states.|`|Sicr0Mdoaa	Go around telling people you voted for Obama.|`|85a8f0d6d41c57acd11e132086872502aa	Just don't say "g'day" or "barbie" and you will be fine.|`|ZKPqp92Oaa	just chill, be nice to you neighbors, help your community, pay taxes, if you don't have a social get an ITIN NUMBER, learn our history, and eat a lot of tacos too, their good tho lol, and don't be racist toward others, its rude and anti-american|`|SUM0UMakaa	It takes time.|`|bLXGrfAqaa	Don't ruin yourself, you're just fine.
QIQNzE11aa	Yes they can do this. They have their own legal system. <br>  <br>  Go talk to the chaplain of the base as well. Get him on your side, will be well worth it! They tend to have more pull than most realize. <br>  <br>  They should not have done this on a third party call and with the wife saying it has never happened. <br>  <br>  Dress nicely, not too much make up either. Seriously, remember military can still be a bit backwards. No cleavage, no legs showing. Dress nice and proper when going to speak to fleet and family support. Explain very nicely you don't know how they got such a call as it has never happened. Explain that you certainly are upset about all of this and want it repaired as quickly as possible. <br>  <br>  Ask them to find out why a person would do this... ask them to look into the person who called. Tell them you can't understand anyone wanting to be so nasty as to do this to your family, so you'd like them to try to find out the why's of it all. <br>  <br>  Best of luck. Will send out a prayer that you get your hubby home. Sorry this happened to you both. |`|RjUhISEIaa	As you have unfortunately found out they indeed do..and did...have the right to issue this order to him.<br>  <br>  Hopefully your trip to FFS tomorrow will correct this situation for you.<br>  <br>  And hopefully there was simply an error made that gets nobody in trouble but if not an error and it should have been someone else ordered to stay away from their spouse the order will be issued to the right person.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA12119076	Contact a lawyer now.
Qou0CLwiaa	standard operating procedure everywhere.<br>  <br>  you are hired at will, just like you could resign without notice, you can be let go without notice.<br>  <br>  once you give notice, you are a risk and liability to the company. It is time for them to move on without you. they don't need you anymore, and you agreed they should go on without you when you resigned. in effect you asked them to continue to pay you for 2 weeks in exchange for work, they decided they don't need the work from you and would rather have the money for other needs.<br>  <br>  As for IT/security, that is how it goes, In many places you are not able to even go back to your desk to get your stuff - it is brought to you. There are good legal and security reasons for being quick to disable your computer, your keys, etc.<br>  <br>  what you need to do is anticipate consequences better, and you can start by reading and *understanding* documents you sign *before you sign them*.<br>  <br>  what you should do next is use the 2 weeks to prepare to do whatever you were going to do anyway.|`|RjUhISEIaa	You could have a case but the question you have to ask is will it be worth all of the trouble? Remember, you were offered the chance to read the statement presented to you first and refuse as you had given notice. <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to take the matter up with someone higher in the org than your manager and see what happens without the expense of retaining a lawyer...at this time.|`|fWZO9MBaaa	You should do nothing- you were not terminated, you resigned. A company normally doesn't want to keep an employee around after they have given notice as the company realizes that employee no longer has their best interest at heart. It's not really about your pay it's about how much you could cost them in other ways.
ohUm00RYaa	Like everyone else here I'll agree unions are bad. <br>  Basically in 1900-1980ish companies would **** on employees, make them work hard and then fire them on a whim.  Basically employees were abused and there was a real need for unions.  Unless your company is dangerous, or you are violating the labour laws, there is no real need for a union.<br>  From an employee perspective it means less pay as union eat your slaary.  From an employer perspective prepare for strikes and threats.<br>  <br>  Honestly if you listen to your employees you won't need a union, the fact that employees want one where you work already suggest that they are unhappy with you as an employer.  If everything was going good, why need a union?<br>  My suggestion would be to make a suggestion box or bargain with the more vocal members, avoid uions at all cost, it will ruin your business, once they are in you can't get them out.<br>  Your better off paying salaries higher now, then to pay it to a lawyer for the next 30 years.  Just think how much time you waste arguing over stupid things|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	allow? you really need to talk to that lawyer.<br>  <br>  as for the auto makers, the union was as much to blame as the execs, both only want everything for themselves with no thought of who gets hurt.<br>  <br>  unions are always bad for a company, because all bosses are heartless. (my company reprimanded an employee for leaving work early, he had a heart attack , EMS performed CPR and he was taken to the hospital by ambulance. we were happy he survived. work probably would have killed his pets and sold his children into slavery if he didnt return to accept the reprimand).<br>  <br>  unions are not always good for the employee, as some are corrupt. only taking dues and not getting anything for the employees.|`|P02L0DTNaa	You have no choice, It is not up to you allow your employees to unionize. U.S. labor law allows for union organizer to unionize a shop at the behest of the employees. Also if you are in a right to work state you can have both union and non union employees working together. On good thing about a union, especially a trade union is that in business downturns you can send your union boys back to the local for reassignment. You also have at your disposal the union rep to work with you on problems with insubordinate members. "A union is only as good as its worst member."|`|RjUhISEIaa	Personally, and there are union members who will disagree with what I am about to say, but the union's time has run its course and is no longer necessary in this day and age. There are labor laws that now cover what the union's initially set out to do and that was protect the workers. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA12164049	That is not your decision to make.  If it was, unions would never exist in this country.<br>  <br>  Remember what unions do.  In theory they stand against management and try to get better wages, etc. for employees.  By definition, management always wants to make more money for the company and therefore will try to drive down the wages and working conditions.<br>  <br>  Talk to your lawyer and remember that unions are the ones who brought us weekend, 8 hour work days, and safe working conditions.|`|8crSDGSnaa	No, I would threaten to sell the company.<br>  As "Boatin' in VA!" pointed out, there is no need for Unions anymore.<br>  They will only want more and more each year.|`|AA11622716	Better talk to that lawyer because it is not entirely your choice.  The ability of a union to get new members and to bargain collectively is governed by federal law and refusing to deal with a union or taking other steps may amount to an unfair labor practice under federal law.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Unioins are nothing but trouble.

0IOjeecoaa	yes it is, for too long the rest of the world has stood back and let them get away with what they do. they cross over defined borders and kill and destroy, in the name of god, if that is not the act of terrorists i dont know what is then. But please dont compare hamas to al qaeda, the hamas struggle for their homeland is not to be connected with the other organisation in any shape or form.<br>  To do this allows the rest of the world to justify the actions of israel.<br>  Go back in both holy books of both sides, they worship the same god, have the same holy sites, it is just that different people over the centuries have bent the story to suit their own wishes.<br>  the israeli's should go back within their borders. The U.N should give the palestinian people a homeland like their predecessor the league of nations done with the jewish people, this would go a long way in making peace, and say back off to israel in a big way.|`|1YkAbnXoaa	Hey if your neighbor is shooting 3 bullets a day at your house every day and it kills your cat in the first week youd be mad then he continues after you tell him to stop and kills your dog then you threaten him and tell him to stop and he keeps shooting, wouldnt you go out buy some ammo and blow the living daylights out of him.<br>  <br>  That is what Israel is doing.

Identify a witness if possible.  2nd, you need to tell this supervisor that you feel uncomfortable with him touching you in anyway do this in front of a witness if possible.<br>  <br>  If he harrasses you and/or your witness again then go immediately to the human resource office at your company and file a complaint with the human resources office supervisor.  <br>  <br>  If the company fails to act to stop this form of harrassment you then have the grounds to support a civil lawsuit against the individual and the company.<br>  <br>  You must do all of the above before any complaint or lawsuit can be initiated.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	Ya just let him know you feel uncomfortable with his behaviors and that you would like them to stop<br>  <br>  If he persists then file a complaint through your HR office|`|DZzBfzVeaa	no you are not overeacting but before you sue him  you have to give him a chance to stop. You need to say something to him and let him know what he is doing is inapropriate if he keeps doing it try to talk to his boss and if the behavior still continues then you can file for a law suit.|`|F0uLexezaa	he has every right to monitor your calls as this is his job. you should have just shown him the pic of your daughter and held the phone for him.<br>  now, the unwanted touching. this is a no-no. you need to make your feeling known to him that you don't want anyone touching you. document your conversation. if it reoccurs, go to your human resources and make a formal report.<br>  you don't have "enough" to sue since he didn't touch a "private" part of your body (quid pro quo) and you have not yet asked him to stop this behavior.|`|RjUhISEIaa	A very large company should have an HR department, correct? Tell them and forget the lawsuit. It protects your rights and hopefully will bring this idiot into line with today's world.

Try telling your supervisor that you do not want to be touched and you would like it to stop.  Do not give your phone to him, if there is a picture on it that you don't want seen, and make sure to never be alone with him.  Have a co-worker document any contact and witness any inappropriate words or gestures.  Usually filing a grievance with ones employer will suffice|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	I'm not sure if you can file suit based solelyy on what you've said here.  You must tell him that his behavior makes you uncomfortable and that he is not allowed to touch you anymore.  If he proceeds to ignore your requests, then yes you can think about filing a suit.  Make sure you document every occurrence and try to get some proof that he isharassingg you (proof that will hold up in court).|`|YTJ5Upneaa	Before you can even think about suing, you must go to his supervisor and tell him/her what is going on.

I also know you are not allowed to have inappropriate images of yourself or anyone (including calendar shots) anywhere in the work environment even if the images are locked away or in a drawer or in your personal bag. This man who is harassing you can twist this by telling HR you gave him sexy pictures of yourself for him to look at. He has no right to harass you and I'm sorry he's doing that to you. However, you need to be professional at work and not take images like that to your work environment because it will a) get you in trouble with HR and b) give men like your supervisor opportunities to create diversion if charged with sexual harassment.

Neither of them did anything that brought about the crisis we are now experiencing.<br>  <br>  Most of the blame can be put on these few actions:<br>  *  The Bush administration relaxing the regulations on credit default swaps.<br>  *  The greedy bankers giving out bad loans because they knew they were going to wash their hands of them in credit default swaps.<br>  *  The Federal Reserve Chairmen Greenspan and Bernanke raising the Federal Funds interest rates from 1% to 4.25% in just two years time.  That in effect caused many monthly mortgage payments to double in size.<br>  *  When a lot of the loans were being foreclosed on, many of the banks stopped giving out loans, even to people and businesses that could afford them.<br>  *  High inflation caused by speculators driving the price of oil higher and and higher.<br>  <br>  In the end, it was many factors that brought us to where we are now, but the lies spewed by the congressional republicans to pass the blame onto the Democrats is just plain false just like almost everything else they claim.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Seriously just take a step back and look at what you're saying here.

WO68RZdIaa	You have received some really good answers. I'll include the link for US Code Title 18, Chapter 110 below. It has some really good reading;    Here is the definition of Child porn by the US Code:    (8) child pornography means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where  (A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;  (B) such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or  (C) such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

Just in the first few sentences of the article, I'm relatively sure they mean to say that a "child", by law, is prepubescent (younger than a teenager). Of course, age-wise, who is considered a 'child' and who is considered 'not a child' probably depends upon the state or local legal system... but there might be federal laws about it too. Read it up, if you're interested.|`|CowgOqXTaa	Pornography is a sexual representation, intended to appeal to prurient interest, that is devoid of artistic merit, as defined by community standards.    Child pornography is pornography that includes minors.    The definitions are fuzzy by nature. Two different juries could see the same picture, and one could find it pornographic and one not.    Richard|`|AA10118655	It's just as it sounds: It's porn using children as the actors.    Defining "children" is easy: Anyone under the age of 18 is a child.    Defining "porn" is going to be more difficult. Even legal porn (legal adults as the actors) is hard to define in some cases (most situations are very obvious, but some could be classified as "art"). There are websites of nudist resorts that show families on a beach (mom, dad, and kids), all nude. Is this porn?|`|bd1a21e42be72d6eab7819f7b0991a63aa	I think if you have to ask, it probably is porn.  Standards are set by individual communities about what is obscene.  I think the definition is something like:  child porn is the sexually and/or physically abused involvement of anyone under the age of 18 as determined by the reasonable person standards of the community.      I think every family has nude pictures of our children in the tub, or innocently running around the yard after taking there diaper off.  There is a fine line between abuse and innocence.    And it is a shame that sick persons have to cause or are entertained by the loss of innocence:  There is a joke that two babies are lying in the hospital side by side. And the one looks down under his blanket and says, "I'm a little boy."   The other baby looks under her blanket and then asks, "How do you know you are a little boy?"  The first baby  answers, "Because I have blue booties."    Pray for those who are abused, and pray for the abusers too.|`|Mzjoeld4aa	The people in the porn have to be children, not digitally remastered adults made to look like children or adults who appear to be younger than they are.

What this does is make Obama a poster boy for hope/peace (which is a lie obviously) so-to-speak and having children pledge to that is more about them pledging to an agenda-     this way they can on one hand do out with nationalism by training the kids early, get them to have been in favor of believing in a government agenda as a passion point so they will never know any different- in later years then government can just switch the agenda and not have to worry about who the poster person is...and kids will be raised thinking government agenda knows best    At the same time the feds know the world is watching and will want to follow suit ion the name of progress. This is pretty gross in my view. I say- Individual concentration is the best agenda because if everyone concentrates on doing their part without interference people wouldn't need agendas at all.|`|600367b3135824b97a54e03105e6a6feaa	that cant be true...|`|cVEHvqxEaa	Most schools don't pledge the flag, much less the president...

deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	It's impossible to know whether you'd actually be arrested, though you ARE, as others have pointed out, committing a crime.    It would depend on the cops -- they might just confiscate the beer, and tell you to go home, or take you home and talk to your parents.    Or they might haul you in and call your parents; whether they charge you would be up to them.|`|AR8AyFqbaa	mip  minor in possession  its illegal for you to drink or possess alcohol|`|yj3GT7jOaa	yes|`|TtI7VtTfaa	You'd be charged with minor in possession of alcohol.    It's illegal for you to possess alcohol even if you aren't drinking it.|`|XeGvBJLjaa	yes defiantly any underage person with possession af an alcoholic beverage can be fined and or arrested just by holding the drink.|`|NEH7JWNMaa	The cops Could charge you with possession. I have no way of knowing what they WOULD do.
JDltTREfaa	In their day-to-day careers, cops face way more danger than soldiers.      Many people have a negative opinion toward police because you only ever hear about the bad ones in the media.  And, in truth, bad cops can do some truly awful things.  The sad thing is that the bad cops are a tiny, tiny minority of all police officers.      Unfortunately, it's pretty unusual for someone to be happy to see a police officer.  (I think cops are a pretty outstanding group of people, but I have to admit that I'm darn sure not happy to see those pretty blue and red lights in my rear view mirror!)  We live in a society that doesn't encourage or demand people accept responsibility for their own actions - so many people get mad that the cop actually caught them breaking the law.  They are the folks who like to embrace the idea that all cops are bad.  (I'M not bad for stealing, speeding, driving drunk.  All cops are crooked - so HE is the bad one.)    In contrast there are many more people who join the military than become police officers - so it's a larger population.  Most Americans have had at least one close friend or family member in the military - so they wouldn't tolerate media efforts to attack all soldiers.  Plus police officers have MUCH MORE authority over individual Americans than someone in the military.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	They've been brainwashed into thinking that way.|`|AA11598520	The military face more inherent danger since you are expecting at some point to be attacked. The police, though, don't expect to be attacked nearly as much nor should they. The simple car stop is the most dangerous part of the job since they never know what will happen when the pull someone over. Just last week a local cop was killed when two cars driving by couldn't mind their own business and had to see what was happening. They hit each other and one of the cars plowed into the officer's patrol car, which pinned him underneath.     Sadly, these days, the police are often in a war zone. As for so many thinking they are crooked, it makes them feel better about having been arrested. See, if the cop is crooked, then they really didn't do anything wrong; it's the cop who is bad.|`|2VtFVKCDaa	Because being a policeman is a job. Being military is a commitment.|`|URO3gDXcaa	i don't.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	There are many who have no respect at all for the military and in many instances, hate them and see them as a waste of money.    I call them Liberals.     The military we have today will probably bear little resemblance to the military we have in 4 years. Well, actually on the surface it will probably look exactly the same. They will be wearing the same helmets and body armor, carrying the same rifles, driving the same vehicles and flying the same aircraft.      Everything will just be a whole lot more worn and beat to sh*t.    It's the problem we had when first going into Afghanistan and Iraq.|`|FB4BPJKGaa	I think it's because the Military fight for the country while the police just do their job.|`|AA10929359	One Can Kill you if nessesary. guess with one? of course  if your are from Middle east youll fear more a soldier than the devil itself.|`|92f4208c0af3ddb07f37652180d67f0caa	Says who? Son just because you're in the military doesn't mean people are going to respect you more. I think the general idea is to respect none of them. :D|`|WyasZnFCaa	**** the police|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	I wouldn't say there's no comparison because in fact there are many similarities...depending upon where you attend a police academy.    My military training was similar in discipline but  my firearms and self defense tactics were more intense in the police academy than military training.    Where you train more in some aspects of one military training unit...you may not in another.    I learned a lot more about laws in the police training than I did in the military law.     To say soldiers face way more danger than cops is a matter of perspective.    In a war zone you know your enemy...in the streets of the US...you never know who your enemy is.    Many who feel cops are crooked is simply a problem created by the media and young adults who THINK they know more about the law than the police who arrested them. You never hear a follow up story about someone on Y/A complaining about how the cops stopped them, with responses telling them how illegal it was! More than likely, the questioner was too embarrassed to admit they messed up.    Yes there are crooked cops in this world but there are also crooked politicians, lawyers, firefighters, doctors, pilots, and military offenders and many more.     Because law enforcement is such a "high profile" profession, it gets media attention much faster than most professions. The media gets paid for sensational stories. You don't see headlines that read "Local Family Woke Up After Eight Hour Sleep."     Let a controversial issue occur, then you'll see the headlines read "Cop Shoots Unarmed Suspect." They don't tell you the suspect threatened to shoot the cops...pulled something that looked like a weapon...it's known as "Suicide by Cop."    I spent 20 years in the military as a law enforcement officer and fifteen years in the civilian law enforcement profession. I'd rather go back to the military where it's safer!    Sadly, our country as lost about 4 thousand soldiers and sailors during the Iraq War. Vietnam accounts for about 58 thousand.     Police Officers who gave their lives in the line of duty, about 15 thousand.    No matter how you look at it...these are brave individuals who put others before themselves to make our nation a better place.    So take this with its purest intent....military or civilian...it's a dangerous world...military or cop!|`|NePxlTnZaa	That's an interesting one considering there are a lot of ex military who become police officers when they leave the army etc.    The job of a police officer includes pointing out peoples transgressions and taking action for them, people don't like their transgressions being pointed out to them, it's human nature.    Soldiers don't do that and therefore don't attract the same hostility. perhaps if we lived under martial law things would be different.|`|9XJLlPaEaa	Probably because soldiers are more abstract since they do not usually patrol local streets, whereas the police seem more accessible and vulnerable.
gE03TUtQaa	It must have been really good head or poop chute or both,.
Ulff1hcDaa	Welfare is a generic term that could be used to describe many different program.      "Welfare recipeint" could be a widowed grandmother who gets help with her medication or a family who gets help with rent or a person with a disability who gets help with food.  They are all people and they all have different challenges.    If you are talking about TANF, I can tell you that my job is to help people work through barriers and get back into the work force. Sometimes that barrier is a lack of work experience so I set up some volunteer placements. Sometimes the barrier is child care so I help them find reliable child care. Sometimes that barrier is some sort of addiction so I help them set up treatment.....and no, I don't withhold food from the family while they get the treatment.    Have you never needed help with something?|`|xo4iux9gaa	No; Clinton would never pass.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	Well, I would imagine that the costs would be prohibitive.      Along with the suspensions of service and the appeals.      I would be happy if those that are capable of work are forced to actually seek work and prove it.|`|W0VL46gDaa	Id say so..     I mean, I have to comply to take random drug tests to work here so I can pay for some drug addicts welfare!    I have always wondered why there is such a double standard.    Seriously, the majority of people on welfare (in my town anyway) are a bunch of low lives, who are totally capable of working btw, who sit at home collecting pain killers, smoking weed and collecting their laziness checks.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I don't see why not...    Snowboard Zombie...I don't know if it's a state thing, but here in Cali they have cards exactly like that...they are called EBT cards and I accidentally hit that button instead of DBT whenever I use my bank card...it's annoying.|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	Absolutely  My employer drug tests and so should the govt|`|5ac2dCxJaa	Yes after the politicians are. I would love to know what kind of Pharma grade hooch the people in charge are poppin'. I am being serious, everybody with a job in this country has to get tested but they never test these guys who make the desicions about paying welfare, testing employees, tax laws, etc etc.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	YES!!|`|kPWGVeWhaa	Sure. But it would just be another expense.      I think they should be given debit cards that work for only certain items...sort of like food stamps work.  No cash.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	Yes, I think they should. Reason is they're receiving tax-payer funds. Since we are supporting these people we have a right to know that the money is being used for which it was intended. It's no longer their business when the public is financing their habits.|`|c3vPZfghaa	sure, and when they fail the drug test and lose their welfare, they can rob the money from you after they have you on your knees with a gun in your mouth.    Maybe you should start looking at the benefits you recieve that aren't tangible, from our country offering welfare.    all drug trests will do is increase the cost of each check by about $400 per precipient per month.    Our current ways of doing things like preventing people with drug convictions from getting financial aid for college is counter-productive faith-based crap, why not add some more, so dealing drugs beomes their only option. And when you people have to run out of enemies to force into drug dealing lifestyles, who then will you target?|`|YonedWiEaa	no...just pick them up at their dealers house on the first of the month and skip the test......|`|xagiOb80aa	No.  Folks should not be searched and/or seized without probable cause.  No one surrenders due process simply because they are poor.    Further, it would only add more red tape and expense.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Yes they should but then that would incur extra cost on the part of the gov|`|seeRRQkraa	No.    Because although bush really, really tried, we don't live in a Fascist State.    Geez - WHEN will Righties stop trying to have the government in every aspect of our lives?|`|3wyxasucaa	Shouldn't they not receive welfare period?|`|kE29abUUaa	They should. Tax money should not be going to those who are just going to spend it on addictive psycho-active drugs.|`|2si53dCRaa	I would say YEA! That's probably be one of the best ways to cycle out anyone who is just a piece of **** leech on the system.  Ofcourse, unless they have cancer and need to smoke a little weed but can't work because they're sick.  If they were to do this they could see who deserves the money and who is just going to go spend it on crack.|`|CG5NnL8Yaa	You wanna make little kids pee in a bottle? They are the majority of thoses on welfare.    How about we stop outsourcing our jobs so people can find jobs that actuallly pay the bills?|`|Hcg2juS7aa	YES, I would have to have a drug test if I worked for the government, why shouldn't I if I were getting money from the government for doing nothing!    im - kids aren't on welfare, their parents are.  The check doesn't come in the child's name, now does it!|`|Ve18FAnGaa	wouldn't that be a violation of civil liberties (as that the two things are not directly related in the eyes of the law and thusly, one item does not give the gov the right to pursue the other)?  wouldn't it also promote more government incursions into peoples personal lives and thus bigger government?  i wonder how many conservatives will see it that way?  probably not many since this isn't on the schedule for times to talk about constitutionality and big government|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	This right winged rationale person believes that would be a violation of their rights.  Welfare is a bridge to nowhere but there has to be just cause.  In the Obama administration a over half of the countries population would then have to be tested since hes spreading the wealth,    I also believe Mike Phelps apology for being a human being is sufficient.

In other words, too dumb to understand certain facts.  The weak minded individuals don't want to but they need to rely on politicians because it's easier for someone to think for them or tell them what to think than rather figure it out for themselves.  By the way, I am an American and proud to be one.  I'm just stating facts.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I am watching a man right not on CNN who is saying there are 110 people in Gitmo that are hard core terrorists. He is being asked where he gets that figure because they had another expert who said there were only 15. So I am sitting here wondering why republicans would rather spend their life putting everyone down knowing it pulls them down instead of telling the truth & risking that some people might actually succeed which would make their life better. Yes, I believe truth would make things so much better. Obama is living in integrity but right now I am so afraid that we will lose all are good workers. I do have faith in Obama. I have watched Oprah run her business based on integrity & she's doing OK.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	I agree with> yummy|`|j7l9gavRaa	YES|`|5hxWSezPaa	Yes.  I make my decisions based on facts.  That is why I do not call the Iraq war one that is being waged on lies.  You have failed to give us any FACTS to support your assertion that anything was said  by the Bush administration knowing that it was false at the time.|`|IBXElKCTaa	No.  Facts are Facts.. but we have parties because of the different way we view facts..    Example. Democrats see 900 billion dollar stimulus as needed to stimulate the economy whereas Republics see the stimulus as unnecessary.     Example: Republicans see Iraq as a war front for the war on terror and we are doing great things over there... Dems see it as spending to much money and people dying.    We all have the same facts, but its how we view them that divides us|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	Facts like Hussein Obama has know ties to terriorist who bombed the Pentagon?  Facts like Hussein Obama Has no evidence that he was born on US soil  Facts like Hussein Obama has no experiance running so much as a 7-11 let alone the lone super power on the planet?    Yeah, those would have been some good facts to have people to vote on.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Yes.  Maybe you should try a spoonful of your own medicine, Chi Guy.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	The answer is yes but it might not be all there is to it. I mean the big American political parties are like football teams, they have supporters but when you look what they actually stand for it's remarkably the same on the big lines.    Facts play a role in determining who you are and where you stand and why.  I do believe more Americans should ask those question first before joining or aligning with a party based on their position on the issues without taking into account the context. The real issues that divide Democrats and Republicans are incredibly unimportant and small.     I mean you can look for a party that fits your views or you can choose a party that better fits your views than the other one.  Very big difference|`|wbJXqkVGaa	Yes, not only US but the world would be a better place.....    We shall wake up to a brave New World......Whoo Hoo...now you got me going;-p|`|AA11939795	Sounds good in theory but a problem arises: the facts according to whom? Everyone lies in some way shape or form. Everyone has their own idea without conjecture so allowing a political party that type of power and control has some Americans looking through their fingers. Sometimes we can listen all we choose to politicians but in the long run, the only thing we can really count on for factual experience is ourselves, we don't need parties for that. I don't think America would be a better place philosophically as individualism tends to outweigh the greater good because no one in that placement of authority has those answers, at least not going back to that conjecture point. Then we have a problem, a breakdown in communication, wires get crossed and ultimately a demise of personal freedoms. Now that's one party I'd like to avoid, if you catch my drift.|`|seeRRQkraa	Oh God Yes, but then we wouldn't be America. I'm beginning to think the citizens of this country have been effectively "dumbed down" to the point of no return.|`|cPpQ2dW5aa	It already happen when your nation chose Noble Son as leader.

If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck,  it must be a ??????|`|GE6vqqF8aa	I don't think any charges will be filed. Even though there may be a photo, there is not tangible evidence that definitively proves that what was in the photo was a controlled substance. Drugs cannot be postively identified via a photo.|`|5ZfcMc34aa	The Sheriff is just talkin' shi4 to make a name for himself.    A photo of Phelps smoking a bong does not prove anything illegal was in it.    His only hope for evidence would be witnesses, who would also be guilty, but protected from testifying because of the fifth amendment.    Unless there is someone who was in the room who wants to incur the ire of the world for needlessly having Phelps busted, there is no case.    Phelps is not the first person in the world to take a toke...everyone needs to drop it.    edit....The Corpus Delicti rule holds that a criminal conviction cannot be based solely on the uncorroborated confession or admission of the accused; that is, a confession, uncorroborated by other facts, is insufficient to show the corpus delicti of a crime and cannot support a conviction.|`|UAW6fd4baa	This photo proves he should have been    busted a long time ago            http://www.pyzam.com/funnypictures/detai...|`|600367b3135824b97a54e03105e6a6feaa	come on... we all know what was in the bong.

Frankly, I think he's quite stupid for allowing himself to be photographed doing that. I don't really have anything against the action itself, and if it makes him happy it's all good, but he has to know that he's got many sponsorships riding on him, and that with his achievements he's a role model for kids. Phelps has to assume that people are going to want pictures of him when he shows up in public, so doing this for everyone to see was a pretty dumb idea.|`|POzCKBzvaa	I've seen bongs being sold in corner stores where I live.

ISAF is seperate from OEF, which is led by US General McKiernan. These troops are operating in the east of AFG and although they fall under the command of ISAF, they operate independently of the mandate that the UN has for ISAF.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Not really.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	There are several reasons. The main ones being these two.    1) The United States is not a Democracy, it is a Representative Republic.  2) There are just not enough hours in the day for every person to vote on every issue.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	that's a pot head question, direct voting leads to mob rule|`|z88IMXNFaa	Because the US is a representative democracy.  Our representatives vote on laws.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	It would take forever and be too cumbersome|`|siTibEIGaa	Every year there are, "referendums". That means the public gets to vote on the ballot about certain issues such as education bonds, or local laws. Marijuana is slowly being decriminalized throughout the US on a local level, but none of that matters until the Federal marijuana laws are changed, because in America, Federal law is "supreme law of the land". I'm really not sure how you go about getting a referendum on a ballot. Contact you local community leaders and they can tell you more about the process.|`|4f794ec7691416e516e1475a13f3f2caaa	We had a vote on whether Britain should stay in the EEC. We voted yes.

They have telephones and email.  You'd be surprised how few people actually use either to contact them, and how influential you can actually be by calling and yelling at them politely.|`|AA10118655	Because the lobbyists wouldn't have enough money to buy the votes needed to pass the laws.    Too many people are not informed enough to be making those decisions. This is the biggest problem with a true democracy. You can't force the people to research both sides of every issue. And because of this, there would be too many people then voting on the issues they know nothing about. It's bad enough this happens when they vote for the people in government, but it would be even worse if it was for ever single issue.
1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	No.  The "stimulus" bill being touted right now is mostly pork going to various politicians' pet projects.  There are no tax cuts and no checks going out.  About 12 cents of the amount they are willing to spend will actually create any jobs, so that is about 1/8 of the bill.
WO68RZdIaa	MP's were the Army's police officers, but that job has been handed off to Dept of Defense employees mostly on bases in CONUS (the bases in the US).    MP's are one of the most deployed MOS"s in the US Army. The MP's are in charge of the POW camps, they are tasked with providing armed escorts to military convoys, and providing security in Iraq & A-stan for example.    I did 15 yrs as an MP (95B era) & have been out for quite some time now- so I'm not sure as to their mission now for CONUS bases. But I'd have to assume, even though most duties have gone to civilian DoD employees- that your fiancee will still get to patrol the base, issue citations, do the much detested gate duty alongside the DoD police.|`|JlEucUVtaa	He'll die.|`|KmwvwT6Eaa	i am married to a guy in the army. it doesnt change to much just depend what his job is. if he full time you will most likely be moving a lot. like my husband he is not he had drill once a month at his base for a weekend and that pretty much it til he gets shipped out. My husband is overseas now for a year its hard bc we have two kids under the age of 4 so he misses a lot of what they did. but the army trys to take care of us as much as they can. there are some things they need to improve on for the family but thats life i guess. now my husband trying to go full time so i am very happy. i met my husband while overseas the first time.(long distance/ blind date). if you need anymore help my email is shorty5883@hotmail.com|`|1efab44c45307bd4314827ad52bed39caa	If you pay any attention to the suicide rates in the Army, you know that they are highest amongst recruiters and detainee handlers.  Remind your husband often that you do not expect him to be anything other than human.  Its OK to ask for emotional help.  And its OK to refuse orders that violate international laws of armed conflict.  The Army should start to clean up (a little bit) under Obama.  But it is a horribly dysfunctional organization that covers up problems with anything but solutions.  Know that he will return a different person than when he left.  And it may not be for the better, as the endless commercials and messaging we get from the Army would have you believe.  Spend some time on www.CAMMMO.org to familiarize yourself with the realities of the Army's crumbling infrastructure.  It will help you understand what your husband is going through.
uxu8qJUYaa	He said 57 because he had not been to all 60.

Ask Supreme Court Justice Roberts for his opinion, since he's the one that swore him in.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Whoever told you he's Kenyan was lying to you.    But then, anyone who had any brain at all would have realized that, if he weren't qualified under the Constitution, he wouldn't be president.    Anyone who isn't completely brain-dead realizes that saying 57 when one meant 47 is meaningless.    No one with any brain thinks that the economic crisis that started before his election is HIS fault.|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	Last I heard, at least form the horse's mouth so to say was that we now have 57|`|qlduZDO3aa	No, No, verbal gaffe, we were already there, no defense budget has been submitted, he did not promise this, he did not say that, and the last one doesn't make sense.      Honest simple answers are easy...|`|ksGBVJyhaa	NO silly Obama is from the state of denial|`|e52Wy71Laa	This is yet another meme that seems to have gained legitimacy through repetition.  There is no documented source that I've seen -- none -- that verifies he was required to be an Indonesian citizen to attend school there, and plenty of people who have said they knew of other foreign nationals that had attended the same school he went to.    Also, if you're going to quote slips of the tongue, what he actually said would have added up to 58 states.  (He had intended to say he had campaigned in 47 of the lower 48).
DY9NOh4taa	Obama is going to do what every Democrat, who makes it to the Oval Office does, he is going to give all these people including the Porn. Industry their bailout money, and then after the economy starts rolling, start taxing the American people to death, with various new taxes, and then Obama is going to look the American voters in the face, and say "what are you bi***ing about I got the economy rolling didn't I".  It's like the surgeon who takes off the whole hand instead of a couple fingers and says "quit complaining, I saved your life".  It is a ploy that has been used by almost every Democratic President since Johnson. Who wasn't in office long enough to start the tax programs against the American public.  John McCain warned voters, during the campaign that Obama would tax the country into a depression, if he got elected, and signs of it of starting to show, when up to 10,000 people in one day loose their jobs and Obama has the nerve to say he is working on a stimulus plan for the american people.  That could be the reason why Obama's approval rating dropped 15% in less than a week, and people are starting to say "forget the first 100 days, we want action now".   Obama is going to find that he doesn't have the 100 day advantage that other President- elects have had, because of the state of the economy, and people not willing to see what is going to transpire 100 days down the road.  People can also forget about things like health care reform, and stuff like that because every minute of Obama's day is going to be spent on answering the critics, who were once his close friends and confident's.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	Get back to work you hard working conservative.|`|xo4iux9gaa	Yes, just keep printing money....its worthless.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	I prefer Tax and Spend to Borrow and Spend everyday of the week.

I've never looked at politics this way and it really helps me when pondering issues. Now for you question. This stimulus has been in the works since before the first stimulus has passed. Congress will pass this after some revisions are made. What useless govt programs are you referring to? Money for low income housing? With the economy the way it is, YOU may end up being the one who needs to get a place in the projects, so I'm all for that aspect of it. Are you mad because that means less money for your stimulus check? What are you doing to help shape the bill? Emailing your congressmen? Anything?|`|DLvHWOo7aa	And this is worse than Republicans who simply spend without taxing because ?|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	No.    What everyone with a brain realizes is that we need the government to stimulate the economy by buying goods and hiring people.    It's not kick-backs to fund a pro-democracy organization that hires unemployed people to HELP people.    "Global warming crowd"? Everyone who has a brain knows that we need to develop clean energy (which will also save everyone huge piles of money).    Preventing businesses from closing, and people from either going on welfare or starving to death aren't useless.    But then, a person would have to be a human being, with a brain and a heart to realize any of this.|`|jk0rAkEjaa	LOL  its pure pork just like the dems always do. Spend spend spend.

Creating government jobs is not economic growth.  Funding the arts, university endowments and special interest groups does not create jobs or consumer confidence.

The way they are structured, they will make you live on that money for the rest of your life.  If you try to live on, what they give you, you practically wind up homeless.

Because, They will wonder why, the money given to you wasn't used for it's intended purpose.|`|61YfPllfaa	looking for answers eh....if what you are saying is that you were claiming social security and housing benefit and were living off the two while Your husband paid maintenance then that is fraud. you are supposed to declare every thing. a friend of mine used to give her ex husband her rent (a little each week) so that he could pay it for her because she didn't trust herself not to spend it.....she had got into trouble with her rent a couple of times before you see, and well....seeing as it was hes kid, he wanted to make sure she kept the roof over their heads......so he nagged her for the money every time he came to visit the child. it worked very well.....any! way. i recon itle be ok. good luck.|`|vZMN82U8aa	er, technically its fraud, BUT... if you offer to repay the money, before they demand it with menaces, then it wont goto court.     but, youre bankrupt, so have no assets or monies... i suggest you fail to mention when questioned that x hubby is paying, and youre living off the benefit...     and its not the reciever you need to be worried about its the DSS...     but you can offer them a quid a week... and if youre on benefit, with squids, they can ONLY take five quid a week...|`|DuOl2cFXaa	Basically you are stealing. You are receiving money that you are not entitled to. Money that me, the tax payer, on pittance wages are having to pay. You may say that thousands fiddle, sure, but that doesn't make it any more right.   The sentence will be on how much you have fiddled, recently lots of people have been jailed. (That's of course if gets noticed.) You could always say you give your ex the cash to pay the rent Presumably you have a rent book.|`|iaugc41aaa	That's a good answer from jeanimus, which I fully endorse.  I can, however, add a little more.    The Official Receiver IS under a duty to report any wrong doing and, no matter how you dress things up, that's what this is.  Be prepared for what follows and, when the investigation officers ask, explain that it was a mistake and that one payment was being off-set against another: do not complain to them about benefit levels - they don't like it.    They may or may not decide to prosecute.  A lot of this is down to how they view you.  If you appear contrite and are looking to make good any defaults (despite the bankruptcy) you are more likely to get a sympathetic hearing all round.  If the agencies decide that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute and try, effectively, to get blood out of a stone, you could get a very sympathetic hearing.  On the other hand, if you are antagonistic, the ORs report may just get someone going for the jugular and pressing not just for prosecution but jail time as well.|`|Qqj1VTmXaa	If you have been receiving housing benefit and your husband has been paying your rent even though he is doing so to help you, then it is benefit fraud because had you informed the benefit people of this arrangement they would not have allowed you housing benefit, surely bankruptcy was enough. The penalties is they may well as is usual prosecute and seek recovery of the full amount payed out to you. I really hope you can sort it out with the benefit office because the courts do not like benefit fraud. You will find it hard to convince the benefit fraud officer that you were unaware you could not do this as its clear when you apply for housing benefit. I should also warn you that on the whole they do prosecute and always seek recovery of the amount and the courts always agree, sorry but on top of bankruptcy youve added another mess|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	You should tell them that your rent was paid by your ex and you used the benefit in place of the maintenance.  If the maintenance was more than 20 a week and you were on IS then then you have committed benefit fraud. The Official Receiver is probably obliged to report this to the DWP. You may or may not get prosecuted. It depends on how the DWP feel. You will not just have to pay back the difference between what you did get and should have got, you will have to pay it all back.  And since the decision to recover it will be made after your bky order, you cant put it in the bky even though the debt was incurred before the bky. The penalties are custodial sentences at worst and having to pay it back at least.  Under the insolvency rules you have to comply with the OR so if he asks, you have to tell him.  If he doesnt ask, then thank God and make sure your ex stops paying your rent and get it sorted.|`|rftEZA50aa	It's fraud and you could be cautioned or go to jail. It's probabily not in the public interest to send you to jail unless they decide to make an example of you. You must declair ALL earnings AND gifts. The fact that your bank account shows HB payments going in and no rent going out is enough to put you to the question. I work with the housing department but not in the benefits section, however; I have referred tenants over to HB fraud departments for questionable 'issues'. You will more than likely be ordered to pay it back. Visit your loca CAB office before going to the interview.

The odds are not too good, there are millions of applicants per year and only a couple thousands can obtain a GC this way. This is up to your luck but you can try it (Mexicans are ineligible - they cannot apply this way).

He also asked me to send cough drops, that is the only thing they can have that reminds them of candy. There was one guy there selling them for a $1.00 a cough drop. I cut out clippings from the local paper to send him also. I have also sent alot of funny cards and he tells me in all his letters how much it helps to get mail.

There is a website you might want to visit that I think could help you both out quite a bit. I am the co-founder of a brand new online community designed exclusively for the military, called Defender's Own. On Friday and Sunday evening, we host Founder's Chats, where our community comes together to talk about military life. Most of the people who join us for these discussions have had experience dealing with husbands, brothers, nephews, sons, etc. in basic training. We would love to have you join us for one of these, I am sure you will be glad that you did! Its a lot of fun too.    Also, I think if you could send him something that he could share with the other guys. News on (positive) current events can help them feel conected to the outside world. Newspaper clippings with articles he would be interested in etc.    Stay strong,  James  www.defendersown.com|`|2e38ba1c0e8cf1c9c2e04ef1758703c6aa	Remind him of silly memories, and keep him updated on the local/family gossip!!!

Harriet Harman is a vile woman, a militant feminist, who in her younger years was deemed to have views which are so extreme, that she had to tone them down considerably to get into the labour party. Although many in the labour party harbour strong views in regards  to particular issues. In fact the labour party to a considerable extent; is a bit like a collection of every kind of liberal nut which you can think of. <br>  Who true to their Marxist roots, are united by a hunger for power, and an obsession with moulding society and public opinion via the legislative system, and various institutions into something which fits their own party political doctrine, So that they can overturn a society which they have always despised. A few years ago these people were all a bunch of angry upper middle class hippie type students, with a picture of shagavara on their wall. Then they all got together in the labour party, and now with their limited experience of the real world, and only a set of rigid leftist principles to guide them, they are now  running this country into the ground. They have profoundly damaged the social fabric of this country in many ways. <br>  And I think that that nobody least of all Harriet Harman the Feminazi can save them. This guy sums up the labour party’s legacy and fate quite nicely:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QjtuDtd4eM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QjtuDtd4...</a>|`|ab37b6bdb0bbbf15c8bbba9c3715bb8faa	If you take a look at Harman's history as a champagne socialist and that of her husband Jack Dromey the last thing the Labour Party need is that pair running the country. We are in the crap up to our necks now with Clown Brown.<br>  John obviously has got her number as well.|`|YHPYg7pWaa	Harriet Harman is a seasoned politician who knows the 'ropes' of intricate political manoeuvring and the Labour Party workings at White Hall.<br>  She is a survivor, who over the years has pointed the bow of her political boat into whatever the political Labour  prevailing wind was blowing.<br>  She is no supporter of Peter Mandelson, the Emperor Ming of the Labour Party;But is astute to realise that to openly oppose him would be political suicide.<br>  To be perfectly honest with the questioner,Harriet Harman is 'fine' when it comes to domestic issues such as women's issues and fox hunting.But when the political net is cast on important issues such as  foreign affairs unfortunately Harriet is well up in the  political line of aspiring Labour 'has beens' and 'losers'.<br>  What ever Harriet Harman says in her protestations of loyalty and fidelity to the incompetent Gordon Brown.Never the less, I would still take precautions to protect my political back.<br>  Remember;Aspiring Labour Party leaders carry very sharp political knives!|`|5W2rEsvFaa	Im just checking my calendar, I thought it was April 1st!!

I don't know what she is feeling.  Their system of justice holds that this is fair and justified, and there is argument for it.<br>  <br>  I'm not really qualified to judge her.

This girl was really beautiful, model-type, (her name was Linda Riss, I believe) and she dated this guy named Burt Pugach, a lawyer).  He made money, took, Linda to high-class places.  They dated a lot, and she liked him, but he had a temper.  Burt on the other hand, was madly in love with her.  She dropped him, and got engaged to another guy and was about to get married.  I believe it was a few days before her wedding day, she got a knock on the door.  She opened the door and a man threw lye in her face.  It blinded both of her eyes, and burned off all of her hair completely.    Burt had hired and paid three black guys to do this dirty deed.  Burt served 14 years in prison.  While in jail, he sent money to this women he had blinded because she could no longer work.  When he got out of jail -- NOW GET READY FOR THIS -- (HE MARRIES HER).  They both stated something like this:  only God knows what his punishment should be, and that punishment was for him to take care of her and cherish her and for him to see what he had did to her for the rest of his life.  I believe they are still alive and married today.|`|SMa03xHwaa	I think that Ahmeneh Bahrami should be blinded in the same manner. This is the law in Iran and I am very happy to see this done. I hope that the sentence is video taped and made public because I would enjoy watching this man suffer excruciating pain for what he did to this woman. What he did to this woman is so terrible that there are no words to describe it. In my mind, the only justice that can be dished out to this man is for him to suffer the same fate. Let him see how it feels to have his eyes burned out with acid. Let him have to spend the rest of his life in darkness. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

This is not a Clinton issue, it is a Bush issue.<br>  <br>  In November of 2002 Bush came out of no-where with "Evryone should own a house" speech.<br>  <br>  Countrywide was right there to give the money away. Bush had just finished mailing out checks to everyone in the whole country (HERE is the socialism - "take OUR money and spread it around" McCain, who was bush's little puppy - said, Bush has done the 'send checks' TWICE)  But did it do any good for the country?<br>  <br>  When Clinton was in office the economy had a more balanced position between interest and home prices, plus jobs were being creating - not multinational banking jobs - but real American business were making  themselves out of ingenuity. The little guys had a chance. <br>  The "dot.com bubble" wasn't a bubble, it was Americans having a chance to make their own business which truely IS the American Dream -<br>  Bush busted the dream with Iraq and 911 on his watch, not mention katrina and -again - sending out checks makes the country think they are weak.<br>  <br>  P>S> in the Clinton days - Bill Clinton operated under a Repub dominated Senate and Congree - almost legislative bill passed to him was VETO PROOF - meaning even if he didn't like it - it was going to pass -regardless. So I hope so many posters here understand that they look idiotic blaming Clinton for all the hard times - <br>  FDR too - his programs are not the root cause of todays troubles -  "blaming others to dodge the truth,are we?" some of you guys need to start seeing the truth about 9 years ago or more.|`|HlTF3X3Baa	Scott d & kool aid give excellent concise explanations of how this fiasco was created by government meddling in the markets. <br>  <br>       I'm just answering, so that I can refer back to their explanations.|`|8juUgSK2aa	That's like giving a pair of size 16 jeans to a person who is a size 6 and expecting them to wear them.|`|alQ5wIVqaa	Fannie and Freddie were the base of a very weak house of cards. They only owned one percent. That would be a valid point, if Freddie and Fannie were a bank. However, their business wasn't owning sub-prime mortgages. It was selling them.<br>  <br>  Fannie and Freddie contributed to the mortgage mess by buying mortgages and selling them to banks for high prices so that banks could write them off in tax returns (owning the mortgage of a low-income family and a high-risk asset is charitable). Fannie, Freddie, and the Bank profited.<br>  <br>  The oversight was that these were high-risk loans. Unfortunately, the people who had the mortgages stopped paying them. This resulted in the banks losing money because the mortgages they owned weren't slowly getting the value they were worth. So the banks stopped buying from Fannie and Freddie. <br>  <br>  Fannie and Freddie kept buying the mortgages, but couldn't sell them anymore. That's when they went bankrupt. The banks that owned the most high-risk assets went under (WaMu, Lieman, Citi)<br>  <br>  Barney Frank was at fault because he was the one who pushed the sub-prime mortgages on the banks and encouraged them to buy from Fannie and Freddie (He is in charge of the banking committee).  So, yes. He does have a huge portion of deserved blame.<br>  <br>  I don't really expect you to choose this one as the best answer, even though I know it's probably more factual than the one you will more likely choose (AKA: something along the lines of, "NEOCONS SUCK! YEAH!"). However, I'm just hoping you actually have an OPEN MIND and read what I had to say taking into full consideration as to why I'm doing it.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	*sigh*  i dont NEED numbers for this one.<br>  <br>  start with the creation of fannie and freddie.  FDR created fannie as part of the New Deal, because banks were hesitant or too strapped for cash to loan money.  Fannie Mae was set up to basically loan money to banks from the US Treasury, at very very low interest rates.  This way, Americans could go to banks, get a loan, have a place to live.  <br>  <br>  Then comes Freddie.  Basically, LBJ decided to remove Fannie from the federal budget, and allowed them to keep their tax exempt status.  The backing of the US Treasury was implied, but no longer guaranteed.  Freddie was set up by the government as a seperate, but ultimately the same, entity, to avoid monopoly laws.<br>  <br>  so now you have 2 entities controlling 90% of the mortgages in the US. their combined debt equalled about 40% of the national debt.<br>  <br>  Then years down the road, the CRA in the Clinton era was reformed to basically force loans from fannie and freddie.  He set up lending for the environment, for low income neighborhoods, and basically, anyone that wanted a home.<br>  <br>  so the banks were forced to loan in risky ventures, with money from fannie and freddie.  unfortunately, those loans were no longer guaranteed.  Up to 30% of the loans were of little to no value.  <br>  <br>  then gas shot up to $4 a gallon, and people who were struggling week to week to get by, couldnt afford their high interest loans. <br>  <br>  and now you know the rest of the story.<br>  <br>  i dont need to pull a bunch of numbers to tell you that fannie mae and freddie mac were backing worthless loans to banks.  the whole country knows it, except for a handful of democrats who somehow believe it was all bush's fault.  this is why obama never discusses the cause of the crises, except to say the failed policies of the past.  Just tune into MSNBC, CNN, ABC, or even FOX news, and im sure at some point, theyll be discussing fannie/freddie and barney frank and this entire explanation, as they have been doing for MONTHS now.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Hey schmuck boy, Can you say Mortgage backed securities ? And AIG ? The reason were in this mess and the banks failed was to due to sword swallowing liberals forcing banks to give bad loans to home owners, Those bad loans were then insured, And when they all started defaulting AIG tanked, It doesn't matter how little of a percentage Fannie and Freddy are of the total foreclosures, They still contributed to it . You don't know Jack ! Come back when you do little one . God bless.|`|3lur9XHOaa	So are you saying that there is no real estate crisis in this nation?

And that doesn't include the stealing from the poor to give tax-cuts to the rich! Republicans have always amazed me as most aren't even in the top 5% and are about 2 paychecks away from poverty, just like everyone else! I bet NO ONE on here is in the top 5%!!
fL0wHyNNaa	Hahahahaha... oh, that was a serious question wasn't it?|`|IUXriZQJaa	Yes, I think she is intelligent.<br>  <br>  She stood up to the press and had a field day with them except in the replays, where they could edit out bits of her responses.<br>  <br>  She is poised, graceful, and downright beautiful. She was mayor of a difficult town in Alaska (I fished there a lot) and went on to become governor. Alaska is a survivalist state. They don't elect idiots to be their governors.<br>  <br>  She did a lot to pare down expenses, starting with selling the Governor's Jet on eBay...<br>  <br>  This is a woman with a lot of spunk and way more class than some delinquent who flips the bird to his political rivals and can't complete a sentence without a teleprompter.|`|HlTF3X3Baa	Yes, but character is more important than intelligence. The president can't be expected to know everything, - her job would be more about choosing among the recommendations of experts, and having enough character and patriotism to seek what is best for the country, unlike the way the dems have seized upon this crisis to pass their wish list. They'll keep coming back for more, using the crisis for all it's worth. <br>  <br>       It's a shame what the vitriolic hate spewing left does to opposition candidates. But people grow up eventually, and realize that anything the left hates is a good idea.|`|2ef6c8380bef5a28128bee98974a1208aa	OMG!<br>  <br>  Sarah Palin is about as Intelligent as a Chicken Egg!

She has actually done things FOR the people not for the "PARTY"|`|45b7d0c80d5b3ba262ca6be3b06edc05aa	yes, because it does take some degree of intelligence to work through the republican party machine and become governor.|`|1fDj2bJ9aa	Sarah Palin is everything that is backwards about America.<br>  So the answer is a huge NO<br>  She is NOT representative of anything I represent and she is NOT someone I would even want to discuss anything with, she is dumb as a stump.|`|JP1o1ggZaa	Do you think Sarah Palin is intelligent?<br>  <br>  Yes just look at the Good she has done for her state. She has demonstrated that she can lead and succeed in bipartisan politics that is a whole lot more than Obama can say.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	No, she's clever, but not intelligent.

I think the same is felt with whites in America.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	We should have an everyone history month.|`|xagiOb80aa	Black History month is NOT for Blacks -- it is for all of us...|`|ioCiw5zlaa	They were trying to make up for the centuries of revisionist history that did not give minorities credit for their contributions.    ex: Dr Charles Drew invented the method used to seperate plasma from whole blood.    Yet he BLED to death because they refused to allow him in a Whites Only hospital following a car accident. (true story).    If the USA did not have a history of legalized racism there would be no need for a Black History month. A racist nation created the seperation of races which led to the creation of the things you are pointing out. Blame the racists that created this mess not the symptoms.     Historically Blacks in America just wanted to be citizens with equal rights. It took 4000 lynchings and the murder of MLK to get beyond legalized racism. Blame those scumbags that killed people such as MLK vs the result of their ignorance.      edit Good post BTW! I would give you a thumbs up but instead here's a star 4U|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Whimsy, black history month is NOT for all of us. It is for blacks. I agree with the first answerer. It is not racist to have a white history month. I nominate January.|`|2f2A2Lz3aa	Forget them , We need a Native American month !! Speaking about reality , Natives have more culture and have been here alot longer than blacks plus my ancestors were slaves too ,but we don't b**** about it , funny how how people forget that little nugget . Also blacks were not slaves for 400 years , they were made citizens and allowed to vote almost a hundred years before us .|`|o1Qcjfz6aa	Right!  What if we had a WET channel too?  White Entertainment?  How about Indian history month and arab history month?      What if all whites voted for a white man because of his color?     It's called a double standard and there is no good reason anymore.|`|8jm84S32aa	Don't look now, but pretty soon we all gonna be black.|`|shtP63traa	Grow up and get over it.    Blacks are a minority group that has made uniquely significant contributions to American history and culture.|`|kE29abUUaa	No, it isn't racist, but the entire idea of having a black history month is stupid. The idea of having a white history month would be even more idiotic.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	I'm a Liberal and I personally don't think there should be a black or white history month.|`|IBXElKCTaa	Same reasons blacks blame whites for slavery when it was their own people selling them into slavery.|`|e36bcd7f45f132e8833b6f65649c3f42aa	We know that pride is actually vanity, it is ugly, and therefore we don't need one.|`|yCjTBYAEaa	Maybe we'll get one when we are a minority in a few years.

Same with gay pride day - we get one day because all 364 other are straight pride day.|`|T71SAa1Baa	In America every month is white history month.  In fact every day in every history class celebrated white history.  African-Americans were persecuted by whites for hundreds of years and I think that gives them the right to have a month dedicated to celebrating their history.|`|X4z3GqAeaa	I'd like to see a WET (white entertainment television) channel.      OK steph..... took YOUR freedom away?    were you a slave? no    were your parents slaves? no    were your grandparents slaves? no    What freedom have you lost?    You prolly wouldn't even be here if not for slavery. So get over it.|`|Q5D4CRFkaa	Because for 400 years your ancestors took our freedom away...it's not that you owe it to us, but at least this country could give us 28 days out of a year to acknowledge our history and accomplishments. I think they should have Indian month as well.     Whites don't need a history month. Your history is taught in history books all over the world and has been since day 1. Your covered.|`|86jsHmOVaa	give em a month, you had 400 yrs of white history|`|AA12020119	The history books are full of white history, and about every holiday we have is to some white! My state had to be dragged into the 21st century! Seems many of you seem to have the same issue!    Why do you resent it? I have no issue with it. All Americans come from some ethnic background and most America isn't white. Maybe they will have a minority month for white males!    And why is it a liberal thing?    The United States of America was founded on the principle that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed" Declaration of Independence    Americas was founded on liberal ideals. What part of that do you have an issue with?|`|cVEHvqxEaa	A lot of ethnic groups, including European Americans, have such months. You aren't really interested...you just want to complain.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	You sound like a kindergartener.|`|seeRRQkraa	You've been "wondering this for the past 30 years?"    really?    And nobody's given you "a substantive answer?"    Really??    Gosh, you must be REALLY stupid.|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	Because every other month is white history month. In other words, most of history as we teach it focuses on white, European people, and so they came up with Black History Month to make sure that the African American people who changed the world got the attention they deserve. It's actually really sad that in order to get people to recognize that whites aren't the only history makers, they had to invent something like that. And I tend to personally think it's a little patronizing, actually. They ought to just focus on all of the races equally, but unfortunately there are so many provencial, racist morons out there that it wouldn't happen.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	Because in the 1950's scientists asked a little black girl with a black doll and a white doll, which one is a bad doll and which one is a good doll.  The girl picked the white as good and the black as bad.    It was decided that there was an identity crisis in the black community.  So instead of building better inner city schools and promoting the family they decided on welfare and gimmicks like Black History Month.  See it doesn't matter if little Johnny knows how to read or not, what matters if that every year we hear about the guy who invented the traffic light.    As for some of the other answers:  1.  there are other months designated for other minorities, you just dont hear about it as much, unless you are in the military.    2.  as for whites persecuting blacks, that is partly true, but the whole truth is that whites didnt go running through Africa rounding up peaceful villagers for a life of slavery.  Most whites in the 17th and 18th centuries were afraid of Africa and wouldn't leave the ship.  Blacks captured and sold other blacks into slavery - that is a fact.  And some of the first slave owners in the "New World" were black themselves - that is a fact.    3.  White history month is every month ????  Who did more for the US winning WWII ?  Patton or the 555th ???  Today's junior high history books say nothing about Patton and have a whole chapter on the triple nickel.|`|cPpQ2dW5aa	My 14th brother born with only two toes and I always wonder about that too.|`|eUzBUFCmaa	Because like all special interest groups (blacks, gays, hispanic, etc) they do not want equal rights... they want SPECIAL rights.    They all want to have special rules just for them, to benefit them.|`|TAIj9mVPaa	its not racist. blacks only get 28 (29 on leap year) days out of a year. if you flip through any history book right now you see what.....white people. where in the history book do you see black people. its celebrating black people and their acheivements in america. of course half of you wouldn't care because if segregation was still going on now you wouldn't have to worry about anything. were your people taken through slavery. they took black people right out of africa to be sold in slavery where in history do u see people from Europe getting taken to america or another country to be sold and traded into slavery. i think that its racist that people think there shouldn't be a black history month.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	We have the other 11 months, give em a break, they can barely fill the month they have and it is the shortest of the year.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Because the entire (99.9%) of American history is "white history month!"

The System is, however,<br>  subject to oversight by the U.S. Congress. The Federal Reserve must work within the framework of the overall objectives of economic and financial policy established by the government; therefore, the description of the System as “independent within the government” is more accurate.|`|d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	Not exactly...<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve is a unique legal entity that can be described as an independent government agency with member bank participation. It is organized with a 100% government agency at the top (the Board of Governors), and branches beneath them that are organized like corporations with member banks as shareholders.(Ref: <a href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101/structure/" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/f...</a> , <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#4" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinf...</a> )<br>  <br>  The Board of Governors are all appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by congress. It operates per it's charter and laws set by congress. it is overseen by congress. There is no structure or mechanism for private ownership at this level; it is a government agency. You can confirm this from a number of government sites that list it as a government agency (e.g. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/independent-agencies.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind...</a> Board members are forbidden by law to have any economic interest in a private bank. (Ref: Title 12 chapter 3 of the U.S. Legal Code). The Board determines monetary policy and provides high level oversight of the branches. <br>  <br>  The 12 branches can be considered highly regulated private corporations. Member banks are required to buy shares in their branch. Each bank has one vote.  They can vote for 6 of their 9 board members, the other 3 are appointed by the Board of Governors.  Though the branches are called non-profit, the member banks get a standard 6% dividend on their shares. The remaining 'profit' is turned over to the Treasury at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  For confirmation on this, check out how Hoovers classifies them: <br>  <a href="http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simple/xmillion/index.xhtml?query_string=Federal+Reserve&which=company&page=1&x=91&y=2#HooversCompanyNameMatchesH2" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simpl...</a> <br>  <br>  And those shares that the member banks own? Some say there are so many restrictions that it falls short of true ownership<br>  <br>  From Edward Griffin, noted anti-fed intellect (<a href="http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)</a><br>  <br>  "It's a hybrid, part corporation and part government, part private, part government.<br>  .. <br>  Every bank that's in the system is an owner of the Federal Reserve...  But that's as far as it goes because those stock certificates do not carry with them any of the attributes of private ownership. For example, the holders of these certificates cannot sell them. If you can't sell something then you don't really own it, that's one of the tests of ownership, your ability to dispose of it. You cannot sell it. Furthermore the larger banks put up more money than the smaller banks, it's a ratio to their assets, so the larger banks have more stock certificates in the system than the small ones and yet regardless of the number that they hold, every bank has just one vote. There's another violation of the principle of private ownership. Furthermore that vote doesn't buy them anything. They can't vote for anything of substance; they cannot vote for their national management which is the most important thing, isn't it? The board of directors and chairman of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President, they're not elected by the banks that are part of the system, the President does that."|`|AA10179458	Yes sir.

It was a first strike, with weapons of mass destruction by US.......for NO reason. <br>  <br>  Or made up , BS reasons.   I opposed it bitterly from day one, based on  Constitutional laws, and the principles this country was founded on and was told I did not support the troops.........which was pretty funny, since I AM a troop!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Or at least was.    I am pretty damn sure I support MYSELF, and I advocate the proper USE of such troops, and their LAWFUL deployment......requirements NOT met under  Horse hockey for brains, Bush. <br>  <br>  I was deeply saddend for my COUNTRY, that so many did not see thru his charade and voted for the man a SECOND time. <br>  <br>  It was a national DISGRACE. <br>  <br>  and clearly, many finally saw the light and thought so, in the 2006 elections as well as the 2008 elections. <br>  <br>  my faith in the system was restored.  2004 was a dark chapter in our countries history, to be sure.

Then again, we do seem to ignore and do business with SOB's when it's convenient. I remember we supported El Salvador down in South Am (back in the big 80's), and they support the right wing death squads down there (groups that might have been trained by CIA operatives to boot).<br>  <br>  I can't get all fired up about the "They were BAD people" propaganda, when the US is quite happy to support and ally with just as "bad people", as long as they are pro America.

My concept of socialism is government control of private enterprise, something that Obama have never even begun to espouse.  What he is is a social liberal, wanting to ensure more equity economically in this country and get people who currently can't sustain themselves to the point at which they can.  I don't see the link up to socialism.  Moreover, what's bankrupting America is the way the economy's going.  Would you recommend he doesn't try to create jobs in order to give the economy a boost?  Or reduce costs in other areas?  Should he just leave the economy alone and hope for the best, since the banks have done such a GREAT job rebounding over the last several years?  What exactly do you want?

Understanding even just a small picture of the power and wealth dynamics of the world, I would only be surprised if there weren't conspiracies to control it all.<br>  <br>  What you suggest is plausible.  Elements of it agree very well with what we can readily observe in the world.  As you say, much of what they do has "HIGH visibility".  However, it is unreasonable to expect that anyone with real knowledge of a conspiracy would be reading your question.  And in the improbable event that one of them is reading, I don't think that you're going to see an answer.<br>  <br>  But I can give an answer though perhaps not in the way that you hope.  You see, "individual freedom" (hereafter, liberty) is a special thing.  To have it, one need only exercise it.  The people who are anti-liberty are the ones who do not act free.<br>  <br>  Now, there are real constraints to continued liberty.  For instance, I think that broad taxation lends power to the people about whom you hypothesize.  A pro-liberty action would be to simply stop paying.  However, so few people would support this action that your liberty could be quickly in jeopardy.  The few lone individuals who dare to exercise their liberty in this manner are easily picked off.<br>  <br>  So the anti-liberty people constitutes anybody who will not exercise his liberty.  There must be groups like those that you describe.  But we can oppose them without even knowing them.  Act freely, and their power is diminished.  Few of them would consider open confrontation if a sizeable number of people didn't play their game.|`|UzZyxTtEaa	Anybody but Libertarian or Friedman's classical liberal.

Palin would be one of the worst choices the Republican party could make. It would just help secure Obama's 2nd term and possibly break up the Republican party itself into two halves. Many Republicans are very wary of Palin. She isn't intelligent and she's a religious fundamentalist. She is also very stubborn and has a very bad habit of dismissing good advice. The only people who support her are the very religious Christians (Evangelicals). She would never garner enough votes.

Lebanon has draw the line. It is their prerogative where they draw it!  The peoples known as the Celts are thought to have originated in central Europe, to the east of the Rhine in the areas now part of southern Germany, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. From around 3,400 years ago, these proto-Celtic peoples expanded across the Continent, and eventually inhabited a large portion of central, western, and northwestern Europe. During the Classical periods of Greece and Rome, Celtic culture was predominant to the north of the Alps. Even today, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Cornwall, Cumbria and Brittany are basically Celtic in character. Despite the changes that time has brought, the influence of Celtic tradition is still fundamental."|`|26197953794d6971c6f12cc73f471d5faa	no|`|Z9360MMxaa	If you don't have religious issues then I don't see the problem.

691211ad589af4a4b2bbb86a32191dffaa	I called my Senator in Tennessee Lamar Alexander and spoke to the aid in charge of the stimulus bill and he said it is being looked into and the reason that you have not heard anything about it yet is because it is something that both dems and repulicans agree on so it could be one of the last things added.  The reason being is that the senate debates the issues that the do not agree on first. So look for something around the first of next week.  My best advise would be to call or email your state senator and voice your concern. Also you can email Obama. I posted the links to both.    www.senate.gov  www.whitehouse.gov|`|SSLekPAnaa	Hopefully not. It just encourages people to remain unemployed. If anything, it needs to be cut to around 1 month.

I wouldn't be surprised if they tack on a few more weeks if unemployment doesn't get better. 33 additional weeks is a long time though... New York is pretty awesome for unemployment; why even bother trying to find a job when you can spend 3/4 of year collecting unemployment!|`|6d6e017c9b8f76d8cd183fd898ddc73daa	Because we now have a Democrat president and majority in the House and Senate it is highly likley that if we're still in a recession then the unemployment benefits will be given an extension.  This may even be done on a state level if the Federal government does not pass an extension.  Liberal states like California and Minnesota are generally willing to raise taxes to provide unemployment and welfare benefits for however long a person would like to receive them.  Especially in recessionary times.

55NKPb82aa	This has  happen before<br>  <br>  "SAN FRANCISCO - The California Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the one-year driver's license suspension handed to a 16-year-old motorist police pulled over after she allegedly ingested a capful of cough medicine to battle a cold.<br>  <br>  The justices upheld a 1993 California law in which motorists under 21 automatically lose driving privileges for a year even if a trace amount of alcohol is detected in their blood. The outcome also clarified for the first time that the source of alcohol does not have to be adult beverages.<br>  <br>  The motorist's attorney argued that the zero-tolerance law was aimed at minors drinking alcoholic beverages, not those legitimately taking cough syrup -- in this case allegedly a small amount of cough medicine that was 26 percent alcohol.<br>  <br>  ''It is our position the Legislature never intended to yank a kid's license for a year simply for taking a normal dose of cough medicine for a cold,'' said Paul Burgin, the attorney for Karli Bobus, a Novato girl who was 16 when pulled over in 2002.<br>  <br>  An appeals court, while questioning whether Bobus was telling the truth about what she drank, upheld Bobus' license suspension in January. The 1st District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled that ''a minor can maim or kill if they drank cough syrup or if they drank beer.''<br>  <br>  Bobus appealed that decision to California's seven justices, who upheld the suspension without comment.<br>  <br>  The California Highway Patrol reported that Bobus, now 18, measured a 0.022 percent blood-alcohol level, the equivalent of roughly one beer's worth of alcohol.<br>  <br>  The CHP said she was swerving and stuttering. She was not prosecuted for drunken driving, which usually requires a blood-alcohol level of about 0.08 percent.<br>  <br>  Citing the appellate court's ruling, state prosecutors urged the Supreme Court to uphold Bobus' license suspension.<br>  <br>  ''The Supreme Court considered the appeals court opinion and decided it was well written and correct,'' said Deputy Attorney General Raymond Hamilton.<br>  <br>  Burgin, meanwhile, said Bobus' automobile insurance rates have skyrocketed.<br>  <br>  Under the appellate court's decision, Burgin said, it could logically be argued that minors could be charged for illegally possessing alcohol simply by having a bottle of cough medicine, and that adults could violate open container laws when driving with an opened bottle of cough medicine.<br>  <br>  The case is Bobus v. Department of Motor Vehicles, S131323."|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Maybe because you pulled over into the median of an 8-lane freeway with your lights off and when the officer opened your door, you fell out onto the highway.|`|81Iglngeaa	I would contest that if thats the case, you would win easily|`|Q7ovix19aa	Did you stop in a regular parking place?  Why did they even notice you?  Did you exit the highway or just pull into the emergency shoulder?  Did you take more than prescribed or are you particularly sensitive?  Did you tell them you were drowsy from the drugs?<br>  <br>  You aren't permitted to drive impaired by anything.  You need to talk to an attorney.|`|m3q6CIQMaa	Was the officer aware that it was a prescription?<br>  <br>  What kind of drug was it?<br>  <br>  How did the officer know you were on this drug/prescription?<br>  <br>  Were you successfully able to prove to the officer that it was prescription without the officer having any doubts?<br>  <br>  From the officer’s perspective, you have to realize that he’s dealing with someone who is under the influence…thus you could pose danger to yourself or others around you on the road.  However, and quite honestly, did you deserve to get arrested for this when the officer in fact knew it was a prescription? Absolutely not.   You should not have been arrested for this because your doctor did tell you that it was safe to drive with it.  However, if it puts you under the influence, the officer is not a doctor, so he is going assume it might not be safe.  And if you were not able to produce a document from your doctor saying that it was safe, he’s only got your word to go on, which might not be satisfactory to the officer.  If the officer let you drive off, he’s liable.  What he should have done was made you a call a family member to have someone drive you home or wherever you were going to.<br>  <br>  In court bring your medical paper & a note from the doctor.  A note from the doctor will be HIGHLY credible.

If the whites "pay-off" the debt, how could the left ever use their "white guilt" routine again? Besides, how would one prove that he was personally injured by the events of 150 to 400 years ago? And why would former slaves be permitted to sue the US taxpayer anyway? Should they not be told to file their suit against the Confederate States of America? Not the US that got them out of their fix? Using this logic means that the French have legal claim to sue the US for liberating France from Nazi Germany. It just seems to me that if wealthy Hollywood types feel so bad about what their ancestors supposedly did or did not do, they should be more than willing to give all (not just part) of their earnings to their causes. Not my money. You Americans must realize that the only place you are going to find true equality is in jail or the cemetery.

uzD7rp4Faa	That really depends.  Do you want to talk about true rehabilitation or do you want to talk about the broken system of D.O.C.s Nationwide?<br>  <br>  I have just been arraigned for a violent crime, but I'm not quite the criminal type. I do not do any of the following things: steal, rape, deal drugs, drink to excess... I just didn't have control over my emotions and I just wanted to die.  I find it unfortunate now that I didn't die on that date, because I'm almost sure to be subjected to the Corrections System, instead of some sort of system that will get me properly balanced chemically and spiritually... <br>  <br>  I rant.<br>  But the Violent Criminals who are accepted under the wing of the DOC can be commonly involved in Group level Violent Crime, or individual non-violent criminal activities; and in the prisons there are many Gangs that they can be accepted into, and thus the DOC provides a forum for the individual Violent Criminal to engage similar behaviors within the "Corrections" System itself.  They may even pick up new tools and tips for their illicit trades. <br>   "Corrections" and "Rehabilitation" go together only slightly. Prisons themselves perpetuate crime.  I'd really like to see numbers someday as to what percentage of those who come through the system actually do fulfill the conditions of their parole to the letter (no PO favouritism).<br>  Perhaps one day humanity will go about rehabilitation of criminals in an humane way, but until then it will continue to be a system of carrot and stick, and you can all count on society as a whole getting the short end of the stick on this matter for years to come.|`|TL6c0Ntcaa	Depends what is considered a violent crime. Today our society condones violence as just a way of life. There is very little respect for each other and we tend to be aggressive over the most smallest issues. If we are protecting ourselves against someone that wants to cause harm to us and we retaliate, is this considered a violent act and should we be rehabilitated because we have reacted to the action of another human being ? Is this not self defense ?<br>  I wish I had acted more "violently" towards the person that "violently sexually assaulted" me and other women.<br>  I was not "rehabilitated" for my thoughts of revenge and hatred.

Enlighten us oh great one!|`|1thElV58aa	almost 1-month in  office and your already judging him. wow how pathetic are you. <br>  <br>  I would like to see you run a country, raise a family, do speeches, fly all over the world, stop the war, negotiate with people, try to satisfy everyone. But someone always has to complain|`|QVeRPldeaa	yeah, he hypnotized us all with his speaking voice!  I know without his speeches, I would've had to resort to thinking for myself.  And that hurts :(   <br>  <br>   why so full of yourself, really?  the opposition can't have reasoning and logic as well for their choice?|`|IStGqIWBaa	Some people just have no common sense i guess. I personally think Obama became more of a trend than a politician. You know?|`|cBvxv316aa	Because they are brain washed into socialism.|`|4V2Odsygaa	same reason why you that lost still whine about him.He is the man our President,no one falls for him,you need to grow up.|`|AA11031985	I think he's spiking their chicken or something|`|DramWx7Qaa	Why?

0cfwrcx5aa	lmao.  what tension?<br>  <br>  you do realize that the House has a filibuster proof majority of democrats, and the senate is only short of that by THREE seats?  what you are seeing today, is the democrat party, doing whatever it wants, whenever it wants.  there may be small, as in miniscule, disagreements, but the fact is, they all pretty much want the same things.<br>  <br>  edit: i know this is probably a text book homework assignment, and not an actual question about todays politics.  a good example of what you are looking for, would be the 1995 government, with a republican congress and a democrat president.   check out Newt Gingrich's Contract With America.|`|2ef6c8380bef5a28128bee98974a1208aa	Obama made promises of change and played into what the vass Majority of Americans wanted and needed too hear! Over all Americans are so tirred of this corrupt political congress and just they way this country has become over Greed! We thought Obama had saw enough of this too make changes and use his speacking skills to bring Republicans and Democrat too a middle ground! Also too focus on the Crisis of the American Worker and family! <br>    Congress on the other hand still likes too play by there own rules! They do'nt care what the president made in any promise or anything too do with Helping Americans in this crisis... Congresss wants Politics to be about there own Greed! So, this is why there really is no-more cheaks and balances as we know them too be! Democrat or Republican only has concerns for there bank accounts and how they spend tax dollars to better there own Power & Control!|`|tBSChaT9aa	Nothing, the libs or Dems are in control so now you and all will see their image of what America should  be. its their pay back time and the stimulus package was just the liberal payback bill for supporting Obama. And their little pet projects they wanted for years.|`|r52xDFAcaa	there has not been checks and balances in this corruption of a government since the clinton regime,..<br>  <br>  judges legislate from the bench,..not good,..<br>  <br>  congress making up laws as the day is long,..borderline facist,..<br>  <br>  presidential photo ops and double talk,..just tell us that true communism is the way although the current president is not the one to lead us there,..<br>  <br>  hang on tight for this four year ride,..<br>  <br>  i e a e,..<br>  unificationist,..
au0ssSnvaa	It doesn't DQ you at all. You may have to get a waiver if you decide to go Navy but the Air Force shouldn't be a problem. Best bet is to go to the Air Force and talk to them. I know there is a lot of competition for jobs in the Air Force so it may be harder to get the ones you want.    If you decide to go Navy, I would go to a completely different recruiter.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	It doesn't DQ you.  I'm wondering what's going to happen with 6 months in the military when you decide it's not for you.    Before deciding on any branch, get your **** together and DECIDE if it's what you want and stick with it.

55NKPb82aa	Warren G. Harding (1921-1923)<br>  <br>  Harding was a disaster as President. His credentials for the job appeared to be that he looked presidential and would not go against his backers. His main attributes appeared to be those of ill-health (he suffered several nervous breakdowns during his publishing career), gambling, drinking, and adultery. He was lazy, preferring to play poker with his cronies to getting on with whatever job he was meant to be doing. His marriage was one of convenience and he had a child by his mistress Nan Britton (who later published a book about their affair). He was not a strong personality, wanting to get on with everyone, and had few ideas of his own. His wife was a driving force, influencing some of his decisions and apparently on occasion — like a later First Lady — taking advice from an astrologer. Though popular in office, the scandal engulfing his administration — dubbed the Teapot Dome scandal — robbed his presidency posthumously of any credit. He was not cut out to be President. Left to his own preferences, he would have stayed in the Senate.<br>  <br>  Harding, campaigning on a promise to "return to normalcy", was elected President by a massive majority. He won 16 million votes, against 9 million for the Democratic candidate, James Cox. He was inaugurated on 4 March 1921 and appointed to office a number of the political cronies to whom he was both indebted and loyal. He did little, although during his term in the White House his government hosted the Washington conference on naval disarmament and his able Treasury Secretary, Andrew Mellon, achieved reform of the budget system. Harding largely left the business of government to others, a number of whom did treat it as a business. Interior Secretary Albert Fall and Attorney-General Harry Daugherty were among several government officials using their positions to enlarge their personal finances. Fall was leasing oil reserves — including at Teapot Dome, Wyoming — in return for kickbacks. In 1922 rumours of corrupt practices began to circulate and two of those involved committed suicide. Charges were levelled against Daugherty and Fall and in March 1923 Fall was forced to resign. Harding conceded that it was his friends rather than his enemies that were keeping him awake at nights.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Yes, but I believe he truly meant well.|`|fFrdimDBaa	You ain't seen awful yet.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	Bush was an awful President in every sense of the word.  His incompetencies will likely hurt us for a generation, though thankfully with Obama the total impact will be lessened substantially.|`|9PAavWnyaa	No. The current mess was not created by one person, not entirely by government, and not entirely by the private sector.<br>  Get a grip.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	He wasn't awful but he wasn't great. He could've gone about the wars in a better way IMO. The economy is due to several factors (dating back to 1913) not just 1 person.|`|VWwepyibaa	He spend 8 yrs cleaning the mess of Bill Clinton, and yes Bill can be blamed for the housing mess|`|h2LmAM0Baa	Thank God we finally put an intellectual in the white house again. Bush was like a spoiled, angry kid. Some of his cronies were downright criminal.<br>  <br>  What DIDNT he mess up? The world hated him, he screwed the economy, made the oil dependence worse, rolled back protections for the environment. And the GOP tried to give us Bush II (but dumber!) as McCain's VP!|`|bZy74U06aa	He was good.  Not great, but good.  A lot better than the alternatives the National Socialist Democratic Party put up.<br>  <br>  I voted for him twice with no regrets.  He was a bit too liberal with spending and immigration, though.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Not from where I'm standing he's not. You must watch to much TV. The economic mess your seeing didn't start until the liberal congress took over in 2006. God bless.|`|dWwrZs6Aaa	yea, he may have not been the best president ever, but we just sealed our fate by electing the first pure socialist barrack hussain obama|`|IH6NrVNBaa	He worked with, just about, the lowest rated Congress (Democrat controlled) ever.
AA12178955	your friends dad is a lt. col. that usally means he is in charge of 100 or so troops and he tells them what to do.  the reserve is one weekend everyone shows up and they practice there jobs.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	One weekend a month and 2 weeks a year.  You have an MOS just like AD.
C7wjR42Daa	Because all that yelling messes up your vocal chords..|`|i4NkPeATaa	They train their voices to sound like that, they can yell beyond going hoarse. It strains their vocal cords but they can call commands like no one else. It is a common thing for them to sound weird.|`|52otNiElaa	You mean the "nice di" required by law not to be like the others.|`|b9UFfsdraa	you try yelling for 16 hours a day and see how good your voice sounds|`|BD78ZzYkaa	It's because they are always yelling to get your attention and they put a strain on their vocal chords. They are always hoarse and the only cure is rest of the voice, which we all know is not going to happen as long as they are the DI and they have boots to scream at.|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	I noticed that too. Its just a tradition i suppose..|`|gDSJpRvTaa	A whisper to a Marine DI is...<br>  Him standing at one end of the Parade Deck<br>  and the Plt at they other end...and you can still <br>  hear only his Voice...<br>  <br>  "Good Night Chesty...Where Ever You Are"...
BpcgaJd4aa	No that guy is an idiot.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	You mean, to come right out and discuss racial issues in mixed company?  WOULD YOU?  I want to live a little longer thank you! There will always be bigots on both sides of the color spectrum! Most people are indoctrinated  the moment they are born!  You are brought up as a Catholic or whatever, and it has been drummed into you, that YOUR religion is the right one! Everybody else is wrong! Blacks can't forget the past, and whites can't forget they once were these peoples "masters"!   It seems it's taboo to bring up the subject, unless you want to start a race riot! White cops beating up a black on TV, and the whole black population was nuts!  All they see is the images! Doesn't matter WHAT the black guy did, good or bad - the community doesn't want to hear all that.  All they see is one of their own getting beaten up!  BOTH sides have got to brerak that wall down between them. It's not being a coward to keep one's mouth shut, silence is the better part of valor!|`|jrdtQi04aa	Many people dont mix socially with other races.  That's a fact.  It's because maybe people are not in the same neighborhoods.  I do a lot of social mixing due to employment factors, and I find ya'll folks to be ok.  I'm not a race coward.  I will go into the brave new world of mixing without fear!|`|pDvlQQkcaa	Hearing his whole speech, what he said is that a majority of people subconsciously do not mix with each other in our free time, in the private sphere.  <br>  <br>  And he did include himself among the people who are tending only to mix with his own kind--and something which he needs to correct.   <br>  <br>  Granted, he could have chosen a clearer word than 'coward' to communicate this. <br>  <br>  But I honestly do believe that his intent was to show that while we are legally/politically integrated, culturally and socially, we remain to a degree segregated.<br>  <br>  I did not see it as an attack on myself or other whites.|`|Ocyrox5baa	This guy has a definite racist agenda.   This whole administration is like the "not ready for prime time" players.|`|55NKPb82aa	He has it all wrong it is not about race relation it is all about class(Wealthy Vs. Middle Class Vs Poor) relation.|`|sJeR0kzUaa	Isn't Holder a racist? I thought he's always been one and said racist, bigoted things.<br>  <br>  He sounds a lot like Reverend Wright.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Eric Holder will resign one day in a cloud of scandal.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	No, not a coward. And my nation is not 'a nation of cowards'.<br>  <br>  We do have one major problem - the race card. If a White person makes a political comment about our President, we are generally labeled racist. If we see the fact that a person was hired based solely on skin color, we are racists. Even though Affirmative Action is in fact a racist law, we, the White People, are not allowed to make that comment.<br>  <br>  I fully expect this answer to be reported as 'racist' or 'insulting'.|`|up40wvywaa	No. These words are just more of the same garbage spoken in order to shut up those of us who have no color. To shame us even more into silence so that we step back and let the government put their entitlement programs into action without resistance.<br>  <br>  Eric Holder said:<br>  "Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too <br>  many ways, essentially a nation of cowards."<br>  <br>  "A NATION OF COWARDS" is a book by "Jeffrey R. Snyder". <br>  (we should not resist, but simply give the attacker what he wants. )<br>  <br>  This is one main sentence I am trying to point out that sums up what the Left seems to be doing. <br>  <br>  My husband and I know this really sweet black Preacher man, who is thankful that his ancestors were brought to America from Africa. We all hate the how it happened, but we also know that GOD Himself had a plan of freedom for the Pastors generation.<br>  <br>  This is a must read to understand.  The Black Guard (in Arabic, Abid ???, from a root meaning "slave") The African people were sold by Arabians to the English and brought to America.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	My business partner is black but honestly he and his family are the only blacks I ever socialize with so maybe Holder would call me a coward since we became friends in high school.<br>  <br>  The fact is that I live on a small lake and there are very few blacks within 10 miles.  So am I supposed to go several miles out of my way to socialize with people I have little in common with?|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	I treat other race's like any other white guy like me when I meet them. However, I've been treated like crap by other races at times making me believe that blacks are extremely racist. Even when i'm good friends with a black guy or girl, there brother or sister(literally. not using general slang here) comes along and proves my point by making me feel awkward and then were not friends anymore.|`|alQ5wIVqaa	Every time a black man or woman is involved, unless the other party is also a black man, it's racist.
bARPX1auaa	You will be hard pressed to find much difference between Bush and Obama as time passes.  Even though most Americans see them as polar opposites they are actually from the same camp.  They both support the ideals of collectivism.  Collectivists advocate controlled elections, controlled media, controlled education, the elimination of free speech, disarmament of the population, fiat money, a cartelized health-care system, military imperialism, and global government. <br>  <br>  If you voted for Barak Obama because you wanted change... It may come in a form you never expected.  They call it a New World Order but it's best described as a one world socialist government where everyone will be equal...equally poor, equally hungry, and equally enslaved.  Oh, unless you're in government that is.|`|2ef6c8380bef5a28128bee98974a1208aa	Gitmo and Iraq and Talking to our enimies and I thought he was agaist NAFTA but he sounded more like BUsh on that little promise he made too the Union Auto workers! Ummm, lets see ohhh he is for GReen Energy but likes too also use dirty coal and Fossil's for fuel energy! I am starting too think Obama just might not be  for change but he is almost similar too BUsh!|`|BpcgaJd4aa	So far just closing Gitmo and suspending water boarding....otherwise it's business as usual|`|882aadf45b04a15ccacc11c27555a716aa	I thought the Bushwhacker was still coaching the Obombus?  Regarding your question, NONE that I know of.  Any "diff" between the repubies & demmies?  I don't see any, do you?|`|81Iglngeaa	only one i know of is providing money to foreign groups that provide abortions <br>  <br>  <br>  And the stem cell research from embryos but thats not a big deal anymore because embryos are no longer needed to get good stems<br>  <br>  <br>  ah i forgot about gitmo<br>  <br>  <br>  But basically he is just Bush with less morals and wants bigger government|`|80fWQyDnaa	He is still under the huge mess left by his predecessor !

AA12094894	really speaking you were the one driving so you have to suffer the consequences. Your friend was not driving so should not be held accountable for your action, however he did flee the scene of an accident. So he may face questioning about that.

He didn't do anything wrong, you did. Did you have your license at the time?|`|ijDgKdcxaa	Losing your license until you are 18 is not the worst thing that could have happened.  You could have killed someone!<br>  <br>  Your friend should take responsibility for his actions, that is part of life.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	The fact that, he ran off, makes his situation more serious, than yours.

u9g2Cl6Eaa	First of all, it is only being considered.  And then, it if is used, it will be to deal with deflation as inflation is the result of printing money.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	I think the government exit strategy is to bribe bankers with massive bail outs to ensure they have comfortable jobs to go to when they lose the next election. By the end of this year either the 'quantitative easing' (money printing) will have worked or pensions and savings will be about to be wiped out by rampant inflation.|`|bARPX1auaa	Sorry to say it but the run away train has already left the station.  The rate new money is being printed begs the question of how much longer before a total collapse? Inflation is created as a result of the interest charged by the Federal Reserve on the money loaned to the federal government.  That amount has doubled since this time last year.  Draw your own conclusions as to what that means.<br>  <br>  If you want to see change get involved.  Support the 2009 Continental Congress at www.wethepeople.org|`|ZbG4adQmaa	Oh yep they do - it consists of Brown the Clown and the useless Labour idiots heading for the door clutching one way flight tickets to some tax haven!!<br>  <br>  Printing money will only make a bad situation even worse - i.e. Recession becomes Depression.  Add to that the real risk of hyper-inflation and the devaluation of the ￡ or $ - we will have a monetary collapse the likes of which me, you and everyone else will have never seen.  They can wrap it up in whatever "buzz phrase" that they like - it is printing money and is NOT the answer.|`|Q7ovix19aa	They aren't and can't hold up wages.  They are holding up prices.  There probably won't be large increases in prices but there will continue to be wage decreases.
f51xwGyYaa	Well they'd have to be pretty deep underground if they are cold blooded.. they'd need the earth's core to keep them warm. I think aliens would be more likely to hang out at the bottom of the ocean. But then again, why travel all this way to hide? We'd be like cavemen to them. Though I have always wondered why the computer chip industry technology, stem cells etc, have advanced so fast since Roswell...<br>  <br>  I always liked the 70s show UFO that had bad UFOs, and a human moon base (the show was set in 1980) and the human workers on the moon base wore pink wigs.

DT6QFP7Yaa	Considering the fact that pakistan has more than one heads (president,army chief,isi chief n the talibans ) there is every possibility of pakistan getting shattered in bits.The usa is not at all interested in the development of pakistan.It is only interested in bringing the talibans in to justice for harming its interest  n for that it needs the help of pakistan n without  aid support of pakistan is not possible.So pakistan may go to dogs any time because of their cowerdly behaviour n double speaking  n the USA  will continue to poke its nose in their affairs till the objectives r achived .

Good luck.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	You can fight the ticket if you want.  I suspect one of the first questions the prosecutor will ask you is where you go to school.  The he/she will ask you about how long you have been going there, how often you drive to school, the road you take while driving there, and finally if you have ever noticed all those speed limit signs while driving to school.  <br>  <br>  The schools will excuse you for missing for court.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	Get a lawyer and fight it if you want.  If nothing else, maybe the judge will reduce the fine.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	My advice is see a doctor, get it fixed
X7rPWJU8aa	I think they should lower the drinking age. but do away with the get out of jail free card if caught dui or dwi. if you are caught breaking these laws it should be sit your sorry drunk butt in jail til you are 21...seriously no they shouldn't lower the legal drinking age. and for our solders. allow them to drink on base only. that's a fair compromise|`|AA10206116	No. It would be too easy for those 18 year old seniors to buy booze for their underclassmen. It's funny that America is talking about lowering the drinking age while Britain is talking about raising their drinking age to 21. That just lets you know a lower drinking age doesn't work.<br>  <br>  Besides, when I was underage and even though I never drank, I could still get booze on a whim. It's not like the current laws are that effective. I can only imagine if the drinking age was lowered that the problem would only grow.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	I'm from Ireland and its already 18 here !!! I wouldnt reccommend it as I am 15 and people here start going out drinking at as young as 12 years old !!! If the age was highered to 21 I dont think that teenagers would start until a later age but thats just my opinion ! In France you are allowed to drink at 16 if you are with your parents <br>  <br>  XxX|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I don't think so.  I think if people start younger there's a bigger chance of dependency.  Also, I don't think a lot of 18 year olds are mature enough to drink responsibly.|`|Bi51WJd7aa	Where I live, the legal drinking age is 18.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	No, it should be raised to 48. That would stop a lot of stupid, drunken questions for a while. ;) Then again, i would have to wait till i was 70 to have any more fun on YA. I'll be 50 in July.<br>  Seriously, the law should be raised. Few 21 year olds are mature enough to drink responsibly let alone 18 yr olds.<br>  Either raise it or abolish a drinking age altogether. 18 and 21 are meaningless numbers. They're picked at random according to some nitwit politicians own stupid kids making fools of themselves at those ages.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	No! if anything it should be raised to 25.. people often make bad decisions when there young and often start habits there never able to over come. Those habits cause a downward spiral there never able to over come. I believe is people were older they would be able to make better decisions once they realize the harm the habit could cause to there health and ability to provide steady income needed for a good life.  if you ask  100 25 year old people about some thing they did that had a negative affect on there life . if they had waited till they were 25 would they still make the same  decision..

In the United States, teenage drinking-related death is at some of the highest rates in the world, but we also have one of the highest drinking ages in the world.<br>  <br>  If alcohol is available at a fairly young age, teenagers will not feel that insane curiosity that pushes them to drink in the first place. Look at countries like Germany or France. They have much lower drinking-related teenage deaths and also much lower legal drinking ages. If we're going to lower the drinking age, lower it to a number that will help things. 18 would probably just make the current teen-drinking situation worse than it already is, because it would make it much more accessible to high-school students.|`|VfzuaU2Taa	NO! The legal drinking age should stay as it is now-21 or be raised, NOT lowered. To lower the legal drinking age is to all but ask for 2x the car accidents and incidents that revolve around those people who chose to become drunk and then either drive or behave erratically. The world has enough problems to deal with already, lowering the legal drinking age would cause additional problems that the world doesn't need.|`|m1vfKUITaa	Research should be carried out and then actions should be taken according to the outcome of the research.<br>  <br>  For instance see the biggest wine producers and consumers of the world,( Italy) they don't have a drinking age as such, (they do, but I just sent my 13 years old to buy 4 bottles of brandy and he came back with them) yet alcohol related deaths aren't as predominant as they are in the USA.<br>  <br>  But just changing the one drinking law won't make or break death statistics. I think car BHP should be lowered too, just ask insurance companies (here) for that kind  of data, it's like a war bulletin.|`|uDl5lUtdaa	No.<br>  <br>  I think people are gonna drink whether it's legal for them or not if they really want to.. only difference is now they have to pay a fine if they get caught & they're underage.. so it seems like that'd only be hurting the government if they did lower it.  I can't believe they were even considering this recently...|`|uHxfAyjBaa	It is that in the normal world.....<br>  <br>  Just not in the abnormal world that is the USA.<br>  <br>  <br>  ---Don't you think its odd that you can be sent to Iraq and killed by insurgents....or kill people on behalf of your country...or vote as to who will be your President.... but can't relax with couple of beers with your friends?-----|`|5VmXqN6zaa	I believe that the legal age should definitely stay at 21.

Some medical reasons behind it....some of the development doesn't quite finish until 21....alcohol stunts that.  <br>  <br>  Also..18 year olds are sorta stupid......not that 21 year olds are that much smarter....but they've had some time being an "adult"....little more mature...little more aware of the consequences of their actions.....<br>  <br>  It also forces the younger people who drink to be more cautious.  To avoid the cops..they can't have the out of control parties...and if they go out in public...they have to watch how much they drink.

Get others to do the same. The first group you need to go after is the youth so affect popular culture as much as possible via music, movies, and the internet. Manipulate their lack of experience, their pubescent confusion, and their desire to "belong" and conform, and also their desire to appear rebellious.     Since there will always be dissent, use this by way of divide and conquer. Also, use the "good-cop/bad-cop" strategy in which you are really playing both sides, but people have the impression that they are really supporting an opposing side.    Then you can just sit back as they grow up and take over the education, media, political, and popular culture systems, then swoop in as the ultimate martyr and handle business.    Why you would want to do this would be for no other reason but that you can't achieve happiness or your own satisfaction with life. You would be a nihilist, probably a sadist, and you would have a corrupted or completely absent sense of self.

Lower the standards of passing grades for education so that the public are just smart enough to pay their taxes and bills and not to question the authority they serve. Fill their minds with propaganda through television, media and entertainment. Make them believe that their lives are perfect compared to everywhere else in the world. Have the public believe that their nation suffers grave and serious threats from outside their borders to their national security so that they relinquish their rights in order for the State to provide them safety. Fill their food with toxic chemicals and get them hooked to pharmaceutical drugs that effect their thinking and makes them easier to control. Recruit into the police force people that had a poor disciplinary record in school, with bullying mentalities that have no qualms to hurt people so that they can carry out enforcing the totalitarian regimes rules without question and to brutal effect.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	You'd have to be a politician or leader with a major power-base before you started.  Either you get elected and then wipe out the opposition, and bring in laws to ensure a one-party state ( with you as leader, of course) or you set up an alternative government and overthrow the legitimate one.  Either way, you need a huge number of supporters, and you can only gain those by having lots of money to offer them, or lots of convincing promises for the future, such as lucrative posts for them in the ministries,  or ownership of things like oil-wells and goldmines.   Is your name Goldfinger, by the way ?  If not, you'll just have to find your own planet and colonise it.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	You would make sure that the civil service and military were well paid, fill the leading positions with loyal men, indoctrinate the military to loyalty through training, use the media to show the military and police as esteemed. You would alter education to your accounts, monitor the curriculum so it thought your history and the values which would furnish the distribution of power in your state. Otherwise the state would be unable to legitimise itself to the general public and the military and could easily lose power if it passed unpopular legistlation|`|FFOQLEBiaa	or read mein kampf. well first decide what type of government your wanting. everything youve learned in school( im assuming you live in america), other than history class, throw away, because its all BS and liberal brainwash|`|7uGMyGn2aa	The police are crucial if you are to have any chance of success in creating your own dictatorship - jst look at Hitler's failed munich putsch for example. You have to somehow get them on your side, because after youve dont that the current government will not be able to keep control or restore order, making your accession even easier. You will have to appeal to something which they will like, and something which the current government will not do so it will tear their loyalties away from them to you. For example - the promise of more pay, less annoying paperwork, more protection (such as tazers), better equipment and vehicles,more rights, and job benefits etc.  For education - again increased pay would be a popular choice, which would result in their support. More rights for teachers such as having more than the children! Less political correctness which would result in an easier working environment. Also if you are showing genuine concern for children's educational wellbeing then parents will b in favour of your dictatorship too. You could also incourage more patriotism to be encorporated into the education syllabus.  Overall i feel the fundemental way to control a country - and in particular police and schools is to make them more patriotic. Not as is racist patriotic - thats jst ridiculous - but make them proud of the country they are serving. The they will b happy to keep the criminals off the streets of the country they love, tachers will b happy about teaching the children who will be thier county's future. But most importantly you must not discriminate or show any hatred towards a religious group or race, shown with multicultural britain being one of the most powerful countries in the world.  Hope this makes sense!|`|9ce331db844e331546e7c9460f0e12b1aa	If you're in the UK you don't need to get elected and then gradually become a dictator like Hitler did.  Start by getting your neighbour elected, then persuade him to resign so you can take over with no questions asked.  If you want someone to run education for you, it's even easier; you just bung him a lordship then he can become a minster straight away. Controlling the police is harder to do subtly because they're democratically run by counties, at the moment.  Obviously the counties will have to go but, for now, better perhaps to just change the laws; it's easy if you're careful - just get the Scots and Welsh MPs to remove freedoms from the English, then, if they don't do it themselves, wait for the EU to do the same to Scotland and Wales.|`|p76UK919aa	I think you probaly should keep the enforcment shoalars to make a tallented race for your selve Is your name ellis by chance|`|fxdOmoCqaa	Controlling the police would have to be through their training, to basically have an oath to you, the children can be much easier swayed through making a positive look of yourself in education.

W1xs3vYBaa	I understand that you are trying to refer to climate change and all out warfare.   So far Obama has done many good moves: appointing both democratic and republican officials to ease some hill tensions and making good impressions to the world; however, his protectionist trade policies will probably cause more tension. Moreover, North Korea has re-established that they do not see South Korea as being legitimate. If this situation intensifies the united states will have to break it's long-standing pact with South Korea which stated that they would protect them because the military is too stretched with Iraq and Afghanistan.  The united states can try to ease tensions between different countries, encourage dialogue, but ultimately no nation can establish peace. I have come to the conclusion that our nationalistic tendencies are the cause for genocide and that humans have to re-structure how the see the world. The manifestation will be complex and diligent international law and an international governmental body that are not elected by the individual citizens, but by the nation states to represent the country. If we continue on the path of labeling ourselves X or Y instead of working together as a species we will become extinct.    Global warming can be stopped by the united states by enacting laws that will be very unpopular and cause the citizens to be shocked. However, every country must come to a consensus to do this- not with an accord but with law. This again goes back to an elected world government because we have no executive branch to enforce any international law. Accords can be ignored, look at Kyoto, and Laws as they stand being twisted, look at Gutanamo Bay.    Citizens have to first realize that this is all necessary. That we need to perfect the transit systems, minimizing car usage, and buy from corporations that practice sustainability.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Dangerous gases?

WAjxTnZ8aa	My intention was to explain to you that we do not live in a democracy but the online dictionary definition of democracy has been changed. It now reads as if it were a democratic republic.

Many scholars and political analysts might even argue that we do not have a republic either. One can easily make the argument that social engineering has manufactured consent.

ycwpFNWFaa	Wow, thanks for the info. I guess there will be less illegal guns on the streets now,  I hope.
n2oEhdZiaa	E-3 is Private First Class.  It will bring you a little more income in Basic and AIT www.military.com has pay tables.  It normally takes a soldier who enlists as an E-1 about a year to reach E-3.  This gives you an opportunity to be advanced to E-4 earlier and thus begin to compete for Sergeant positions earlier E-5.  Basically, you're being recognized for being a more qualified applicant and you're getting fast tracked a little bit.  It's a good program.  <br>  <br>  When you go in for your next meeting, the most important thing you are going to need to work towards is finding a job you enjoy.  First off, I am assuming you have professional experience in Communications/IT, etc.  Do you want to do that in your military career as well?  That's our signal branch and you may enjoy working there.  Some people like to do something totally different on their drill weekend, so you may want to give some thought to what that might be for you.  You will also want to know what kind of units are close to your house within a distance you're willing to commute.  What if there are no signal positions within an hour of your house (for example)?  Would you be willing to drive two hours, or would you rather be a truck driver and only have to drive 15 to the Reserve center for drill?  I don't know how you are doing personally in this economy, but there are bonuses available out there based on MOS and unit priority.  If getting as much cash as possible is most important to you, that could change your job options as well.  There are a lot of factors this recruiter can look at with you.<br>  <br>  I would also urge you to schedule an appointment with your local National Guard recruiter as well.  You would be elligible for E-3 in either the Reserves or Guard, but the Guard may have a couple extra benefits for you.  First, the Guard is twice the size of the Reserves.  That can equate to there being more Guard units much closer to your house with a wider variety of units and MOS choices available to you.  If you are interested at all in combat arms (Infantry, Cavalry, Armor, Artillery) you will have to go to the Guard for that as the Reserves do not have combat formations.  Or, if you (again in this example) want to do signal work, you may enjoy being a signalman at an Infantry battalion rather than a Reserve Signal company because the Infantry battalion may give you more opportunities to play in the mud and do "army stuff" now and again, that may not present itself if you are working in an exclusively signal unit.  That applies to any MOS that is directly assigned to an Infantry battalion, such as supply, admin, etc.  Second, if you are planning on continuing your education in the future, your state may offer it's Guard a little bit more tuition assistance than the Federal government offers for the Reserves.  That would be important to look into if it applies to you.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped a little.  Just take your time and see what is out there and most importantly, figure out the job you want and do it.  A happy soldier is a motivated soldier is a good soldier.  If you have been out of school for a while, you may want to review the practice ASVAB at www.military.com as well.  It can give you an opportunity to see if there is anything you need to brush up on if you decide you want to test and enlist.  Good luck!|`|RDgyb7W8aa	In the guard can be called up for state emergencies, flood, tornadoes etc.  On state duty, most states pay less than $50.00 per day.  You could be called up for any time.
6cSZV759aa	Veteran here to answer your questions.  The first thing that you must know is in order for you and your boyfriend to be together you must be married, since the service only allows spouses and children to be stationed with the service member.  Now when you and your boyfriend get married the first thing that you will have to do is get all of your documents together which include your marriage certificate, application for new social security card with your boyfriends last name as your last name on it, and any other documentation that can help such as medical records.  Once you have all of that you are registered in DEERS to receive military dependent benefits.  Your boyfriend should know what I am talking about or at least find someone in his chain of command that can assist him.  When you and your daughter move you will most likely have the service transport your household goods from the states to europe.  The good news is that the Army will pay for it, but the bad news is that you probably won't see any of your stuff until about a month to two months from your move date.  As far as your job search goes, the Army most likely will not hire you as a teacher's assistant in one of their military schools; however, you may be able to get a civilian job being a teachers assistant at the school for military dependents.  The Army has a service center to help all military spouses locate employment both on and off base; however, because you will be overseas you will most likely be limited to on base employment.  The most important thing that I can advise you and your boyfriend to do is plan for everything as far in advance as possible.  Keep records of everything that way if something doesn't go accordingly you will be able to get it fixed quicker.  I wish you and your boyfriend the best of luck.  Thank him for his service and I hope this information helps.|`|MPavjXO6aa	I assume that since your boyfriend is at Paderborn, in GE, he is with the Welsh Cavalry or other unit that is located there.  Being that he is a part of NATO forces in Germany, there should be opportunities for you to work at something other than the NAAFI or the exchange. There are child care centers and so on for administrative jobs with the garrison. You have to be mindful that the positions take time to fill, mainly because there are limited openings. Getting a job on the German economy for an "auslander" is very difficult, the Germans even get first crack at most jobs on the post anyways. Make sure that if you intend to move there, that you line up employment before you go, because if you're able to do so, it would be easier to arrange for your transition and the costs of the move.|`|jQsYIFOjaa	<a href="http://inthiss.505.ru" rel="nofollow">http://inthiss.505.ru</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
KDNWFuZWaa	You can buy a square foot of land that has a title attached to it and call yourself laird, it costs about ￡25-50. You then pay a little extra and can use the title on your documents it is legal to do so. You can not change your title if you do not have these papers.<br>  It is not a scam, however, you have the same title as about 500 others if not more. Basically estates that have the right to be Lairds, are selling of little amounts just to make money, the amount of ground is not even enough to stand comfortably in.|`|8ZpgIHMcaa	When I was a little girl, I used be really proud because I was told that my great grandad was a Laird.  I thought that he a was like a Lord or something.  Many, many years later I found that a Laird is basically just somebody who owns land in Scotland, but it is not the same as being a Lord.  So I suppose that it mean that - yes - you can buy land and then have the title 'Laird' that goes with owning a bit of land in scotland, but the title isn't really worth anything as such.  It just mean that your friend has a bit of land.  I found a link that might help.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.find-me-a-gift.co.uk/gifts-for-men/unusual-gadgets/laird-lord-and-lady-of-the-glen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.find-me-a-gift.co.uk/gifts-fo...</a>|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	It can --- as in this case -- just be a matter of money changing hands. <a href="http://www.mac-sothis.com/legal-become-laird.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.mac-sothis.com/legal-become-l...</a><br>  But it seems pathetic to use the title in ordinary every day life when it has been acquired in this way -- just as people raise their eyebrows when somebody describes him- or herself as "Doctor" after receiving an honorary doctorate.

vUpjOUQQaa	general rule of thumb it is illegal to refuse to take a breath test or a dope test in most australian states.<br>  <br>  If the copper had reasonable suspicion that you were under the influence and it was not alcohol he has a legal right to test you for drugs.<br>  <br>  If that requires you to accompany him to the station then he has the right to ask you to do that. refusal to comply with a lawful instruction can be seen as obstruction or hindrance.<br>  <br>  He obviously felt you were unfit to drive so he took you off the road,<br>  <br>  You played it hard, so did he.....he won!<br>  <br>  the same rules apply regardless of where you hold your licence, if you drive in VIC you obey and comply with Vic rules and laws.If you hold a non Vic license then that is irrelavant.<br>  <br>  You might want to check with your insurer s well , if you live in NSW but work and drive in Vic or a regular and consistent basis that could affect your insurance if you claim.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	There is more to this than you are saying. <br>  <br>  If you have been resident in Victoria for more than a few weeks and haven't changed your licence, then he can insist that you do and treat you as unlicensed.

Big time!<br>  <br>  If they do tie it in ...you could go for murder or armed robbery both of which can be 25 to life. the circumstantial evidence ( having the weapon in your possession in your vehicle) alone will put you away and have you spending the next 10 years in appeals while in prison.<br>  <br>  No previous record or whatever !<br>  <br>   There is more than just ballistics that can tie weapons into criminal acts, Finger prints and DNA can also be used. <br>  <br>  The mere fact that this weapon has deliberately had the serial number removed is a criminal act in itself. possession of this weapon therefore is also a criminal act. <br>  <br>  What Nate p neglected to mention was that In most states even if the prints that are taken from the weapon belong to the actual perpetrator the possession is enough to see charges of being an accomplice and conspiracy to perform a criminal act  neither of which require you to actually be present at the actual occurrence of the offence to be indicted, both sufficient for 10 years minimum on top of the actual crime itself.<br>  <br>  Get a lawyer dude , a really good one!|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Why'd you have it?

Obama is going to spend the money, but not in tax breaks. He's going to put it into investments that pay back more than we spend on them.<br>  <br>  Check out this chart:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/files/economic-benefits-of-stimul.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ourfuture.org/files/economic-...</a><br>  <br>  This shows the 'return on investment' of various government spending.  This chart is not 'liberal propaganda', it was prepared by one of John McCain's top economic advisers for Moody, a very conservative organization.<br>  <br>  It shows that things like Food Stamps and infrastructure spending benefit us by returning more than $1 for every $1 we spend.  At the bottom of the chart are corporate and individual tax cuts.  They don't really help.<br>  <br>  President Obama's plan is about 1/3 tax cuts and 2/3 investment spending.  The Republicans wanted 2/3 tax cuts and 1/3 investment spending.  But it was the Republicans' handling of the economy that got us into this mess.

55NKPb82aa	I hope jail time and losing your driving privileges.|`|b9UFfsdraa	welcome to 90 days in jail|`|m3q6CIQMaa	Getting  DUI/DWI on the first offense (provided that you have not killed anyone while you were under the influence) is a misdemeanor charge in most states.  On the second offense, if you still haven't killed or injured anyone while you were under the influence then it may be another misdemeanor.  However, and this is a big however... the DA could decide to up your charge to a felony since you are repeated offender of the same crime. Misdemeanor crimes are punishable by jail time UP TO 1 year, a fine, or both.  When I say "up to 1 year", that means the Judge can only sentence you to a maximum of 1 year for each misdemeanor.  It doesn't mean you are going to jail, but the judge CAN sentence you if they want to.  On a felony charge, the judge has to sentence you to at least 1 year in prison.  In PA, on a felony conviction, you may get 5 years.  My advice to you is to stop drinking and being under the influence.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Hopefully jail time.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Court Marriage as you call it is under the Special Marriage Act,1954 & section 4 of the Act provides for Conditions relating to solemnization of special marriage.-<br>  <br>  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force relating to the solemnization of marriages, a marriage between any two persons may be solemnized under this Act, if at the time of the marriage the following conditions are fulfilled namely:<br>  <br>  (a) Neither party has a spouse living:<br>  <br>  (b) neither party-<br>  <br>  (i) is incapable of giving a valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind, or<br>  <br>  (ii) though capable of giving a valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children; or<br>  <br>  (iii) has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity or epilepsy;<br>  <br>  (c) the male has completed the age of twenty-one years and the female the age of eighteen years;<br>  <br>  (d) the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship:<br>  <br>  Provided that where a custom governing at least one of the parties permits of a marriage between them, such marriage may be solemnized, notwithstanding that they are within the degrees of prohibited relationship: and <br>  <br>  (e) where the marriage is solemnized in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, both parties are citizens of India domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends.<br>  <br>  Explanation- In this section, "customs, in relation to a person belonging to any tribe, community, group or family, means any rule which the State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this behalf as applicable to members of that tribe, community, group or family:<br>  <br>  Provided that no such notification shall be issued in relation to the members of any tribes, community, group or family, unless the State Government is satisfied-<br>  <br>  (i) that such rule has been continuously and uniformly observed for a long time among those members;<br>  <br>  (ii) that such rule is certain and not unreasonable or opposed to public policy; and<br>  <br>  (iii)that such rule is applicable only to a family, has not been discontinued by the family.<br>  <br>  If you read (d) & proviso attached to this which provides that if custom governing at least one of the parties permits of a marriage between them, such marriage may be solemnized, notwithstanding that they are within the degrees of prohibited relationship. Now in your case does there exist any such custom exist in the tribe, or community, or group or family in either of your of you?<br>  <br>  If there is no such custom in existence then you 'MAY NOT BE ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED' under this Act. Read the words I mention as it means when during the notice period anyone brings an objection for the marriage between you & this woman,giving the reason that you both are related within the prohibited relationship then the Marriage Officer will refuse to marry you with her,rather he can file criminal complaint against you for making false affidavit stating that you both are not related to each other withing the prohibited relationship. This Affidavit you both give at the time of giving notice for the marriage to the Marriage Officer & making a false statement on oath in the form of Affidavit amount to perjury punishable offence under the Indian Penal Code.<br>  <br>  The only way to prevent this to happen if there is no such objection raised by any one during the notice period & after the one month notice period the Marriage officer solemnize your marriage although this marriage shall be a Void Marriage under section 24 of the Act, though children born out of the void marriage will be considered legitimate under section 26 of the Act. All this won't be possible if you try this out in the place/state where you both reside rather moving in another place/state for some time & getting married is the best option for you.|`|80fWQyDnaa	Migrate to America or U.K. .

Anyone in the military should know our real enemies are in Afghanistan and that thats where we should be.  This isn't exactly a secret you know.|`|19L99wvCaa	I'm scratching my head over how this is a problem. The president is Commander in Chief. He orders, and troops comply. It was no surprise that he ordered a surge in Afghanistan. He said throughout his campaign that he would redirect troops there. <br>  <br>  Sure, it would have been a morale booster for him to personally address them. Was it disrespectful not to do so? No. In case you had not noticed, we are in an economic crisis of monumental proportions. There was much work to be done to address the emergent need of a recovery bill. Whether one agrees with such a bill or not, it was President Obama's priority at that time. Had there not been the level of partisanship there has been for more than two decades, he would have had the time to leave Washington to personally address those troops.   <br>  <br>  What I find disrespectful of our troops and veterans is the underfunding of equipment, pay and benefits. President Obama plans to address this. I do not agree that Bush valued our troops lives. If he did, he would have ensured they had the equipment they need to reduce their risk in the field. He also would not have manipulated "intelligence" to justify invading and occupying Iraq. His addressing the troops before deployment was a facade of caring.<br>  <br>  Edit to add: Any cuts that will be considered will be based on what is funded. President Obama will ensure that funding for protective equipment and the proper use of our troops occurs. Iraq was a huge waste of lives and money.|`|G6yyceAxaa	The question of deploying more troops to Afghanistan had been raised a few months ago.  President Bush belayed the issue because he was a lame duck. the Chiefs of staff made the provisions.<br>  <br>  I think that anything that Obama would have done would have been criticized regardless.  If he had flown to speak to the troops, somebody would have complained that he is using taxpayers money on frivolous trips. <br>  also, rotations to Iraq and Afghanistan are pretty routine now (I live near Fort Bragg, and they deploy to one or the other about every 6 months, at least one brigade.)<br>  <br>  I could understand if they were doing a new mission or deployment, but unless you really know a lot about the military, and understand what is going on, it is hard to be objective in passing out criticism.|`|cQsssHQ4aa	He is also slashing the military budget which is going to cost lives. They try and say it won't affect troops because we will still get the same pay, protective equipment etc. However that multi million dollar research project for improved weapons system that they point to that needs cutting - it saves lives also. Neutralizing an enemy before he can attack serves the same purpose as an IBA.|`|82e62204f1233511508a75bdb7acf417aa	He had known of their going for awhile but he was too busy pushing this spending bill through and taking another vacation...

Also, if you are the one feeding her alcohal damn near to the degree of alc. poisoning then, they COULD argue that you took away her ability to consent - I'm not saying it would fly but, it could mess you depending on how they attempted to portry the incident.<br>  <br>  Also, you have to understand, when a woman cries rape - it is not up to law enforcement to believe her - just to complete the investigation. It is up to the defense attorney to blow holes in her story and protect the client. Therefore, if the woman verbally consents and then takes it back -  that proves lack of opportunity to infact rape.

AA11494150	Yes, that is common. <br>  <br>  Speed is detected by radio waves, so it makes no difference if it is day or night.<br>  <br>  The radar emits a radio wave of known frequency. A portion of this wave reflects off the road, and returns to the unit, calculating the patrol speed. The remainder of the wave continues on, reflects off the approaching car, and again, the unit does the math and determines the speed. <br>  <br>  That is the simplified version. Radar school is 40 hours long, so the full explanation would take longer.<br>  <br>  Additional: yes, I did some checking... speed detection in the UK is similar to the US. If the police car is moving, it is using radar principles.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	Theoretically possible but UK police cars aren't normally fitted with that equipment.

So if you see the brake lights come on in your mirror and the police car begin to turn round, slow down pdq!|`|uzD7rp4Faa	Radar guns work exactly the same here in the US as they do in the UK.  The system used is complex, as the squad car is traveling the radar gun calculates the speed of the cruiser along with the received telemetry data from the radar or laser signal that bounces off of your car in the oncoming lane back to the gun and presents your speed.  These must be calibrated every so often, as they are sensitive electronics.  However, when a police car is behind you, they usually determine your speed from a technique known as "pacing" where they take position behind you at a set speed and count the rate of distance you pull away from them.|`|fBb1tOrvaa	I think they can still monitor your speed (I have been told by Police that they can). Their speed is a known variable and this could be factored in to calculate the closing speed and therefore your speed.<br>  <br>  I am not sure that they would take the result any further  - I would have thought they would turn around and follow you for more evidence, then pull you over.|`|6jW5L3Vqaa	Hey ;)<br>  <br>  I don't think the majority of police vehicles can monitor the speed of other vehicles coming toward them. Thats why they get behind the car they're going to pull-over, and get a speed reading first as evidence if it's necessary.|`|FM6CVh8Faa	The equipment carried in some police cars can monitor the speed of cars travelling towards them.<br>  They also carry cameras that can automatically read and record you registration plate in daylight or in the dark.|`|Vrs3mid6aa	It IS possible to monitor you when you are going in a different direction (day OR night) Cameras only capture the incident or events leading up to it (i.e. a traffic stop has been initiated or like videoing irradic before initiating a DUI traffic stop) What you are thinking about is speed detection.
