A drug squad officer says that the arrest was delayed to avoid bad publicity during the campaign, though the Governor's Office and official police sources say that the governor did not know of the pending arrest.      Is this an example of the great family values and good clean Christian morality that we missed out on in the White House when Sarah was so soundly defeated in November?

20090219225620AANHidd	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can an off-duty cop arrest someone that he has had an altercation with, if both parties are guilty?	My daughter was playing intramural basketball games at her college.  A guy on the other team kept "running over her".  She in turn knocked him down a couple of times.  They verbally argued several times.  At the end, he told her that he was a cop and for her to move away from him or he would arrest her.  She didn't believe him, d/t the fact that he had no identifying clothing or a badge on him.  He called for backup and when she walked outside, he followed her and pinned her against a wall.  He and one of his male friends, also her ex boyfriend, cornered her and wouldn't let her go.  She flicked her cigarette in the ex's face, and the cop grabbed her and twisted her arm up around her back.  He kept trying to drag her up some steps so that her could arrest her.  She kept demanding that he show her proof that he was a cop.  He would not.  He ended up body slamming her to the ground, cuffing her and arresting her.  He never did show his ID to her.She is now facing "battery on an officer, obstruction and public disturbance".  He doesn't even attend the college.  Does anyone know any rules that could help her.  This happened in   WV.

Does that mean they won't be part of the US anymore? or does that mean they just want their power back and by doing this would reverse and remove some of the federal government restrictions and other things imposed on them.  I guess an example would be federal gun laws.  By doing this would states be able to reverse this?       Will that mean they are still part of the US and we'll still have 50 states?

My wife and I were pulling into a parking lot before a USC Basketball game. As you can imagine, there were pedestrians everywhere, and flaggers waiving you into the parking lot. I was the second car at the light and when it turned green I checked the intersection and went through. However, I was pulled over and cited for "failure to yeild to Peds in Crosswalk". I have no past infractions and this claim is absolutely ludicrous. That aside, the actual infraction code listed on the ticket is "21805(B)VC", which by definition in California is "(b) The driver of any vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to any horseback rider who is crossing the highway at any designated equestrian crossing which is marked by signs as prescribed in subdivision (a)."      I find this humorous as we were in DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES and there probably isn't an equestrian crossing for 20 miles. However, is this error on the officer's behalf grounds to have the ticket dismissed?? Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.

20070618181636AAZM548	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Why are there so many steps in purchasing a firearm, and so few in puchasing ammunition?	In order to buy a firearm legally in California you must first successfully complete a firearms safety course, go through an extensive background check, find a licensed firearm dealer and wait out what I believe is a two week waiting period for handguns. But anybody over the age of 18 can walk into just about any major sporting goods chains store a purchase ammunition on the spot. It seems to me that if firearms have serial numbers, then bullets and casings should have some identifying markings as well. Imagine if bullets and shell casings had some some identifying serial numbers laser etched into them. To be able to tie a bullet, to at lot number, to a piont of sale, to a bar code, to a drive's license and maybe to a murder. Something etched on the inside of thr casing and the "tail" end of the bullet itself. True crimminals obtain firearms illegally as a matter of course, but dare I say very few of them load their own amunition. Bullets that could be trace back to the purchaser.

If the US would put its over-inflated pride aside and join canada and mexico, it could help keep america on top in the long run. US nationalism is now obsolete. any thoughts on any possible alternative to keeping america on track in the long run? besides getting rid of bush, thats become a cliche.

20081216120938AA5Nk0h	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Unethical Termination?	I submitted a resignation letter stating I will be leaving toward the end of Dec. After I submitted, my manager accepted and let me go back to work. Not until 20 mins later, she called me to her room and asked me to sign a paper which she said it was acknowledgement of my resignation letter and told me it was a company policy. So I immediately signs it and found out afterward that it was a paper for voluntary leave effective of that same day which is the 15th.  She told me that it would be an embarrassment for me to stay when there will be an annual meeting and christmas party to be held and I'm not part of the company anymore. My co-worker knew prior to my resignation was going to be the end of the month and not that same day.  She made me feel embarrass in front of my co-worker that she terminated me immediately because she wants to save the money for that last two weeks. She watched me to pack all my belongings and immediately there was this IT person to shut down and disable my access to my computer.  They made me leave in a very secretive way.  I believe it is unethical termination because I already wanted to resign in the end of the month and yet they terminated me at the spot and made me sign something I don't want to sign. I was under duress to signing the unknown document.      Can someone advise me what I should do next?

During his innaugural address, Obama himself pointed out that change cannot come quickly or easily, and things will no doubt get worse before they get better. But now it seems like he is attempting to impartially speed things along simply because he sees how desperate people are, like he is trying to please everybody. Granted I am not saying we do not desperately need change, and as soon as possible at that. But you simply CANNOT decide to spend $787 billion in mere weeks, less than a month to be precise, and certainly not in light of the current economy. That is an EXTREMELY dangerous thing to do. We are talking about a man who almost single-handedly created/signed the largest stimulus package in the history of the United States in this same short span of time.

20090220025005AApJmhP	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do people keep blaming the Credit-Crisis on, "Trickle Down Economics?"?	First off, there is no such thing as trickle down economics. The economy runs is a CYCLE, not just one direction (take this from an economics major). It starts when you buy an item. It goes to the company, the company uses it to buy materials for more items for you to buy and to pay their employees.       Now, this crisis has nothing to do with economics. It has everything to do with too much regulation, and if you want to know why I'll tell you. Government gave very good short term benefits to companies who took big risks.      Here's an example of what happened. Let's say I have a  dollar I want to sell you. When you own a dollar, you get about 1% of its worth back in tax breaks. That means you can buy a mexican dollar a 1 cent less than the value of its perceived worth.      So, what are you going to do? Every dollar is worth $1.00, but you can get $1.01 for every dollar you have. So, what are you going to do? You are going to buy a LOT of dollars. if $1.00 can get you $1.01, then $100000 can get you $101000.       Fast forward a few years. The dollar goes bust and all you have left is the $.01 benefit. You paid $1.00 for it, so you just lost $.99 for every dollar you still have. Essentially, if you had $100000, you now just found out that it's only worth as little as $1000.      THIS is what happened. It wasn't an effect of trickle down economics. It was a large enough short-term risk that gave misconceptions about the reliability of the dollar and the value of what it is.

20090220013916AA9umTv	Politics & Government;Politics	Who makes up the "anti individual freedom" crowd?	I've been following the trail of the "anti  individual freedom crowd" for a while now, all the while amassing information on them as best as possible.  Their main agenda seems not so "anti" in nature, as to USE "anti" as a "DIVIDE & CONQUER" strategy.   The anti crowds/groups main goal appears to be "(P)eople (C)ontrol or (PC)". The divide & conquer strategy they use seems to focus on a desire to achieve "elitist" status for themselves over others/masses etc.   While numerically smaller or immature groups of these antis, wannabe elitists are incubating, the more mature groups seem to have no troubles in infiltrating our elected officials minds within our USA.   The methods used to achieve legal backing to their schemes appears multi fold as follows...      (1)  The use of instant mass media for both exposure & to provide an air of "legitimacy" to said group.      (2)  The use of media coverage to "pressure" elected representatives to "toe their line" for them.         (3)  Political blackmail against elected officials in office.  The tobacco suits was/is a fine example of this.      While these "anti groups" are HIGH visibility in the USA, they do seem to "network" globally, as they are active globally.   These are obviously well organized special interest groups meaning they need funds to operate on for a global scale.  Sure, I'm sure the AMA donates some funds to the anti smoking groups, but not enough for a global campaign.   Where does the money come from to fund the anti second amendment groups?  The anti obesity groups?  The anti urban sprawl groups?  There seems to be no DIRECT paper trail to lead from the "funders" to the activists.   Are the following suggestions feasible...      (1)  Rouge nations?  If so how does the "cash" make it's way into country?      (2)  U.N. grants???  But, would that not be illegal?      (3)  Cash drop offs at some secluded spot?      Like the infamous Tre Arrow & the Earth Liberation Front(ELF), WHO funds them?  I mean you don't live in the top of an old growth tree for ninety days with out support, am I right?  Sure, I know their support group brings them food for the stay in the tree.  BUT, what about after they leave the tree?  They gotta go somewhere for food, shelter, medical care etc.   This all costs MONEY!  Where's the money coming from, like WHO is paying them to perform these stunts???  AND, IF their getting paid to perform these stunts, is that not taxable income by current U.S. law???   I must be missing something or else, regarding this subject, I must be alone in this world.

Her son had been charged with failing to pay child support. When he produced evidence to the court that he had the children as much as the mother in a court order the matter was dismissed. Some key information is that the father in this case has had the children more than the 50/50 court schedule for years and until recently stayed current with his obligation. He has always been a good provider for the children.  As the parties were leaving the court room, the mother of the woman suing for child support said he was a dead beat dad. My friend told her to "go to Hell" and is now being charged with menacing.

But just yesterday when I saw him again, he shows me his driver's license and his debit cards and they've all been changed. Well his "title" is added into his name.   In my mind, I still don't believe it but it's now starting to confuse me.   If the title is illegitimate or a scam, can people still add it on legal papers/works like driver's license, etc.?   How is this possible?      So basically, (NOT that I want to even do this I'm just curious) if I wanted, without buying anything or purchasing any estate or whatever, can I title myself as Laird Charlie on legal papers?

20090220025221AA8H3sd	Politics & Government;Politics	Does democracy work in modern day governments?	Many countries that hold elections have major problems with rigging elections and the rich controlling the vote, including America, where political parties control who gets put up for election (if not who gets actually elected).  Most people don't have time to read into the real politics of elected officials and laws, and so are easily tricked into voting for corrupt laws and officials.      In summary: does having a democracy actually give equal representation and help prevent corruption, or does it merely give people a false sense of equality that keeps them from rising up like they used to before democracy?      Personally I feel like its leaning more and more to the latter...I hope someone can argue otherwise.

20090220032347AAWOP5H	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	If the top 1% in NYC pay 50% of the taxes in the city, what would happen if half of those people moved to NJ?	Currently 40,000 New Yorkers pay 50% of the taxes.  the bottom 30% get a tax credit, and the bottom 50% pay no taxes at all.        So if 10,000 of the 40,000 moved out of New York City, would the city government collapse?
20090220025407AAlgUw8	Politics & Government;Politics	Why didn't Obama at least TALK to the troops before he sent them into Afghanistan?	Before George Bush sent troops into harms way, he talked to them face to face. He thanked them for their service, wished them luck, thanked them again, and received the military's respect and gratitude for caring.      Obama essentially sent in a stealth surge with what seemed to be very little regard for the lives he was putting in harms way. I understand that, "he has more important things to do," but this, to me, is very disrespectful of our men in uniform.
20090220025420AAuLEjM	Politics & Government;Elections	Will Al Gore give it one more try in 2012?	Al's still immensely popular with the more radical left demmies & is idolized by the eco-greenies.  If prez Obama goes down in flames, & with two out of four engines already out & the Obama crew donning parachutes it doesn't look good for him, is Gore the next demmie hopeful?   Gore has the business experience, contacts, WEALTH, charisma, looks & status to do it in my opinion.  Al has already been VP, so EXPERIENCE is NOT an issue here.  You can bet he'd pull the woman's vote as their attracted to him like a magnet to steel.   If prez Obama doe's go down in flames, what other demmie candidate would come even close to big Al's credentials???  I think he could do it.  Many still think he legitimately KO'd GWB.  One thing is for sure,  Al Gore has NOT retired!
20090220025612AAfa1Xv	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Drunken consent double standard?	I see many posters around the barracks and also in sexual assault awareness classes that if a female is drunk she may not be able to give consent regardless of any statements she makes and intercourse could be considered rape. However, if a male is drunk there is obviously no protection for his actions (and there should not be). I'm not talking about a situation where someone is passed out, that is cut and dry. They are saying even when a woman verbally gives consent, if she later says she didn't want to and only did it because she was drunk it could be rape. Yet no such protection for the man? Why?
20090220030302AAKq2vd	Politics & Government;Politics	Do peace activists feel betrayed by Obama?	Prior to the economic situation taking center stage, one of Obama's main platforms was withdraw from Iraq and was seemed to be a fairly anti-war, "bring the troops home" mentality. A month into his presidency he is bolstering troop levels in Afghanistan higher than they have ever been before? I would like to hear the opinions of some people who support Obama for his withdraw plan and if they expected this and weather they support it or not.
