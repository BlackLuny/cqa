20090219170207AA6HR7N	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	A question about current for powering an LED with controller.?	I am building a lamp using 4 Luxeon Star I LEDs in series and a BuckPuck.       The LEDs are rated 3.42V, 350mA. The BuckPuck (which puts out 350mA) needs at least 2V over the forward voltage drop, so I am going with a 120VAC / 16-18VDC power supply. My question is what is the proper current output for the AC/DC transformer? I was thinking something like 500mA to power the LEDs & controller with a little overhead. Is that adequate?      Thanks!      LED -  http://www.luxeonstar.com/luxeon-star-le...    BuckPuck -  http://www.luxeonstar.com/buckpuck-350ma...

I solved for t by setting the 1st 2 equations equal, getting t^2-5t-6, which factors into (t-6)(t+1).  So t = 6, -1      Plugging both values into each of the first 2 equations, x and y = 36 or 1.  Should I only be using t = 6?      I set up a partial fraction from there, getting Ay^2(t+1) + By(t-6) + C(t^2-5t+6).

Paul is an apple grower in central Georgia and wants to expand his apple orchard. In her current orchard, there are 25 trees per acre and the average yield per tree is 500 apples.Data from the local agricultural experiment station indicates that if Paula plants more than 25 trees per acre, once the trees are in production, the average yeild of 600 apples per tree will decrease by 10 for each tree over 25. She needs to decide how many trees to plant in the new section of the orchard. Throughout this task assume that, for all apples growers in this area, the average yield is 500 apples per tree when 25 trees per acre are planted and that this yield will decrease by 10 apples per tree for each additional tree per acre.

I'm kind of getting it now, but just to double check:      1) The length of a rectangle is increasing at a rate of 4 cm/s and its width is increasing at a rate of 8 cm/s. When the length is 10 cm and the width is 4 cm, how fast is the area of the rectangle increasing?      2) The radius of a sphere is increasing at a rate of 3 mm/s. How fast is the volume increasing when the diameter is 80 mm? Evaluate your answer numerically. (Round the answer to the nearest whole number.)      3) A particle moves along the curve below.       As it reaches the point (2, 3), the y-coordinate is increasing at a rate of 12 cm/s. How fast is the x-coordinate of the point changing at that instant?      4)When air expands adiabatically (without gaining or losing heat), its pressure P and volume V are related by the equation PV1.4 = C, where C is a constant. Suppose that at a certain instant the volume is 300 cm3 and the pressure is 80 kPa and is decreasing at a rate of 10 kPa/min. At what rate is the volume increasing at this instant?      5)Two carts, A and B, are connected by a rope 39 ft long that passes over a pulley P.The point Q is on the floor h = 12 ft directly beneath P and between the carts. Cart A is being pulled away from Q at a speed of 2 ft/s. How fast is cart B moving toward Q at the instant when cart A is 5 ft from Q? (Round the answer to two decimal places.)      If you can, please explain step by step. Thanks

20090220181148AAHqhgM	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	I need help finding the equation of a perpendicular line?	Three points have coordinates A(1, 7), B(7, 5) and C(0, -2).   Find (a) The equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.   (b) The point of intersection of this perpendicular bisector and BC.      OK, I worked out the gradient of the line AB, which is -1/3 so the perpendicular bisector has a gradient of 3. I tried to do the rest by assuming that C is a point along the perpendicular line, however this was an incorrect assumption according to the answer in the back of my texbook for part (a).   So my question is: how do you find the equation of the perpendicular line when you are not given any points for the perpendicular line and therefore cannot use y - y1 = m(x - x1)?

A cubical block of ice is melting in such a way that each edge decreases steadily by 9.9 cm every hour. At what rate is its volume decreasing when each edge is 5 meters long?      Solution: Let l=l(t) be the length of each edge at time t. Then the volume of the block is given by V = ______ (I said l^3) . Since the length of each edge is changing in time, we conclude that the volume V is also a function of time t. We note that the rate of change of l is constant and that is given as (I wrote dl/dt = 9.9cm) or (I wrote 0.099) m.       Therefore, when each edge is 5 m long, the rate of change of the volume of the ice block is _______ m^3/hr.

It will not surprise many people to learn that for all their supposed infallibility, computers can make the worst mistakes and will break down at the most inconvenient times. That is why May and three others received incorrect statements from banks or other institutions; a fifth person wanted to transfer money from one account to another through a cash machine in order to pay a bill, but the machine was not functioning. All five of them found themselves waiting one day at the various institutions to get the computer malfunctions corrected; one waited at a department store to correct a charge-account statement. From the following clues, can you find each person's full name (one surname is Fillmore), the reason for their wait, and the number of minutes each had to waste because of computer error or malfunction.      1. One woman spent ten minutes waiting in a bank for the cast machine to start working; the other four spent more time than she did, but not more than one hour, trying to correct bills or statements.   2. Oliver, who is not Mr. Gluck, spent one-third as much time as the one whose credit-card statement was wrong.   3. Dugan spent twice as much time as Lorna.   4. Ms. HArris spent twice as long as Peter, who spent more time than the man whose bank statement was incorrect.   5. The time spent by Ms. Endor was midway between that spent by Norma and that spent by the man with the wrong phone bill.      First names: Lorna, May, Norma, Oliver, and Peter   Last names: Dugan, Endor, Fillmore, Gluck, and Harris   Minutes: 60 (most), 45, 30, 20, and 10 (least)   Reason for their wait: bank statement, cash machine, credit-card, dept. store, and phone bill.

Also, this transaction must be done into the BOTTOM of the water-filled tube (eg: we cannot just put the ball into the top of the tube and use gravity)  Any ideas are very welcome, even if they sound stupid :)  So PLZ even if it sounds stupid i need ideas, I've thought long and hard on this.

(still leaks)

20090221020748AARuN5m	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math: Math Anxiety? Who has it? How do you deal with it?	Ok, I again started to have math anxiety way before I even start the semester (it starts on August and I don't know why Im getting these anxiety attacks) and want to know if anyone else has had this problem. I usually fear math basically because I do have fear of success and failure at the same time. My biggest weakness in math is anything higher than basic, so stuff like pre-algebra and above will give me problems. My friend says "its easy" but if thats the case why am I having problems? I don't want to deal with special ed versions of math anymore, I just want to face the challenge right then and there. Anyone been through this? Please help!       Rules:   1)Describe your math anxiety if you have one.   2)Tell me how you dealt with it.   3)And did your methods succeeded.        You don't have to write a novel about it, just let me know.
