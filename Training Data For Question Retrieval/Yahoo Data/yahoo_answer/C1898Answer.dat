AA10845522	Based on what I find here: <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00388385&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=ca&product=483897" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...</a> I'd say that you need to add more RAM. You are running Vista on only 1Gb of RAM. To run smoothly you need at least 2Gb and preferabley 4Gb of RAM.<br>  I'd also upgrade/replace the video card. Your current one is only 128mb. I'd find a PCIe card with 512mb and you'll see a marked improvement.|`|94b08a847f33718a4958a9e47861100daa	First of all, upgrading to Vista probably didn't help. Vista adds more features, which means it requires more resources from your computer.<br>  <br>  The best (and simplest and cheapest and otherwise most perfect) upgrade you can do is probably adding RAM... as much as your computer will let you (up to 4gb, at which point adding more literally has no effect unless you have a 64-bit operating system... which you probably don't).|`|GKB5D6Ipaa	well you can use any PCIe video card since it does have a PCIe x16 GPU slot. I would make sure you have at least 2GB of RAM but you could get 4GB but it will only use 3 since your prob running vista 32bit.<br>  <br>  For the video card get a 9800GTX they are only around 100-120 now and there a very nice graphics card will blow away anything you have now.<br>  <br>  Also this is the RAM you can use. well the fastest you can use. <br>  PC2 5300 (667 MHz) DDR2<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|9apLgksXaa	First of all, Vista requres at least 2 gb of ram just to work alright. Your graphics card is really low on the memory side and I suggest upgrading that too to at least 512. In all, your computer was not ready for Vista but those two things can help your performance dramatically.
AA10867564	you need 2 things:<br>  <br>  1. a router, wired or wireless.<br>  <br>  2. a wireless modem or receiver on your laptop. if you don't have one, you can't use wireless at all.<br>  <br>  if you don't have one, you need to buy the other. if you don't have either, you need to buy both. but, it's far far easier just to buy the ethernet cable.|`|3443ca8928f42fd8cfd8b8d2964936d4aa	Hi.

I am not sure what you are asking, there is no program I know of that will do that, it's a hardware issue.

You need Adobe Flash to modify/open this, but it is not needed to add the banner to your website.<br>  <br>  The .swf file is what you embed into your webpage.

The java script file is probably a script to make the Flash banner active automatically -- if so, Dream Weaver will re-create this file for you automatically.  You might want to upload it just in case.  The XML file probably defines what is shown on your banner.  You need to upload only the .swf, .js, and .xml.

The only advantage is that it takes less time to burn at higher speeds.  High-speed burning is more prone to buffer underrun errors (the write buffer empties out faster than it can be filled) if you don't have enough RAM or your system is too slow to keep up with the burn speed you're using.  If you've got a 2GHz system with 1GB of RAM and no problems with other things running slower than normal, you should be able to burn at 16X with no trouble.<br>  <br>  I have encountered some DVDs that prefer to be burned at one speed over another.

If THIS is what you are trying to do, then you need a file splitter/joiner. WINZIP may be able to do this. I do not use WINZIP so I am not sure, but WINRAR is similar to WINZIP in that both make archive, compressed, files. WINRAR has the ability to split the archive into parts, and to reassemble the archive at the destination where you use the same program to extract the contents of the archive. The original intent of splitting an archive was to fit it onto floppy disks, but I use it to split big files into pieces smaller than 10mb each to send via email attachments. The thing is, most all video files are already compressed so WINZIP or WINRAR may NOT compress it any further. I suggest these only because of splitting and joining the archive parts. If all you need is a file splitter/joiner so you can send huge files in smaller pieces as attachments to email, then try a keyword search at <a href="http://www.tucows.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tucows.com</a> or at <a href="http://www.download.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com</a> looking for a "utility file split join" program.

Virus Cleaner is a tool that will remove selected viruses from your computer. While avast! itself is able to detect and delete almost all known viruses, avast! Virus Cleaner can handle only a small selection of the most common ones. The list can be displayed (in the avast! Virus Cleaner tool) by clicking on the "About" button.<br>  <br>  avast!

Virus Cleaner from the ALWIL Software web pages - for free. Both the versions (the downloadable one and the one integrated into avast! Antivirus) are the same.<br>  <br>  If avast! detects a virus that is possible to remove using the avast! Virus Cleaner, it will show a special button to start the tool. The button (labeled "Completely remove the virus from the system") will be placed directly in the virus warning window - right above the buttons to delete, rename or move the infected file. When the option to start the avast! Virus Cleaner is available, it is recommended you use it!<br>  <br>  Advantages<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is a tool to completely disinfect your system. It repairs the infected files (whenever it is possible) and deletes the virus bodies, so that it is not necessary to reinstall your system or recover it from backups. But it does more! It also removes virus items from the system registry (which is very important in some cases), fixes corrupted configuration files, and deletes temporary files created by the virus (such files do not contain any virus code, so they are not detected by avast! itself - but they occupy space on your hard disk). In short, avast! Virus Cleaner removes every possible trace of the virus from your system. There is no need to perform the cleaning in the Safe Mode - when a virus is found in memory, it is deactivated first.|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Stay off Limewire<br>  =<br>  Download, Install & Run Weekly<br>  =<br>  AVG Antivirus Software<br>  <a href="http://free.avg.com" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com</a><br>  -<br>  SuperAntiSpyware<br>  <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com</a><br>  -<br>  Malwarebytes Anti-Malware<br>  <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a><br>  -<br>  CCleaner<br>  <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com</a>|`|d7bf572dbd1b69fb93ce34ee4b827357aa	Here's a recent list of viruses from the security software I use.<br>  <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/security_center/security_alerts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.f-secure.com/security_center/...</a>|`|BQS2bVjOaa	For all the info you will need on PC parasites, malware, spyware and Trojan viruses, you should check out: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pcthreat.com/removers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcthreat.com/removers.html</a><br>  <br>  Download the FREE infection scanner - and then follow the detailed instructions provided, on how to rid your system of the PC parasites embedded within.

044IeGstaa	As answered, unplug the computer. Open the case. Touch the metal frame of the open computer case to De-static your body. Look at the side of the power supply, and see if there is a sticker. It may not state Maximum watts. You may have to add all the Amps for each voltage rail,<br>  (3.3 volts, 5 volts, and 12 volts) Then take the Total Amps times your house voltage. In the US it's 120 volts. Europe it's 220. Japan it's 100.<br>  <br>  Amps x Volts = Watts<br>  <br>  Or, the sticker may be on top of the power supply.<br>  You may, have to unscrew three or four screws, going into the power supply, from the back of the computer. <br>  Then take a clamp loose inside, that has screws, and drops the power supply down. <br>  Or, there may just be a plastic lock, that holds a metal or plastic piece, that is hinged in the middle. <br>  <br>  Looks kinda' like a half moon in the center, with a small handle coming off of it. You gently press down on a plastic locking piece, to be able to swing the handle to the outside. This moves the half moon away from the power supply, and allows it to drop down.<br>  <br>  There are many designs, to keep the power supply attached to the inside of the computer case. There is Always, three or four screws on the back, however.<br>  <br>  Edit: This is a website that has info and photos, to show you , and tell you about the various power cable connectors.<br>  <a href="http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/connectors.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnect...</a>|`|pbeoPYuJaa	You can purchase a 500w PSU for about $40 The maximum wattage is labeled or stuck on the PSU itself.

Most PSU have about 4 Molex some have 6 mine has 4 plus 2 splitters to share the wattage. The 6 pin connector should come with your graphic card itself. You connect 2 molex plugs (white) to the 6 pin connector, so you might have to buy 2 molex splitters about ￡1.99 from ebay.|`|9ZuPba4Qaa	Look at the label on the Powersupply .It will tell you the MAX power in watts. you need at least a PCI-e slot + 550w PS .you can always use a 4 to 6 pin adapter which is fine .There are 2 different types of pci-e slots a 1.0 and 2.0 you need to make sure what you have. A 2.0 card will not work in a 1.0 slot.|`|uKj3eVoaaa	open up ur case and look around at the PSU for where it says "Maximum Output" that should be ur watt.

1X0sUVPyaa	You certainly can! If you know how...<br>  <br>  Let me tell you what I did and see it makes sense to you.<br>  <br>  First of all, I spent thousands of dollars on "guru" courses and I learned that you can make a ton of money online... What I didn't learn was the nuts and bolts of how to do it! .... So,, don't go that route!<br>  <br>  What I wound up doing was joining a mentoring organization that was much more focused on the "how to" of the business and started to get some results.. (No I didn't make a million dollars in my first week and you won't either)...<br>  <br>  What I'd do in your place is to keep your part time job and use that money to learn how to market other peoples products on the net...  You will very shortly be able to leave the part time gig but only after you have already replaced the income.  Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.... contact me if I can help...<br>  <br>  Micah|`|ZVUjhcM2aa	If you really want to make money online you should find the best information.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having.

sYxUVBvPaa	I suggest at that price either the C6380 which is a great printer and has great color/ ink usage or C7280 which has slightly better color but the big improvement is fax...both are wireless. I know Best Buy has the later on sale for 209 down from 309 or the C6380 is 139 from 199. Also the fax one would benefit you because it has a feed tray so if you need to copy something that is a couple pages long that works well. Not sure if that one also has duplex printing but its something you would want as well for design.\<br>  <br>  As far as epson goes, mostly they are terrible these days and slow. If you get one that works well, they last forever but most of the time that is not the case. HP always has better prints.|`|z46THMt8aa	As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs. You will also spend way less than $300.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|n9JOxJQLaa	Hello go to TigerDirect.com or newegg.com those sites will be as cheap as u can get. their full of top of the line crap but with really low *** prices|`|KDbpIABsaa	yeah|`|vF2rwFeYaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I'm a hand bookbinder who has bound many student projects over the years.  <br>  <br>  From experience I can tell you that Epson InkJet printers produce excellent quality prints when printing on the approriate paper stocks.<br>  <br>  I do not know of any particular model numbers unfortunately, but before going out and buying an HP or any other printer, I'd suggest you check out Epson printers also.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  TgTips|`|TbEwkoQDaa	Try Epson R230, it is a very affordable printer yet produces a high quality output.

If you are a bad person (breaking the Ten Commanments) then you will definately go to hell.. no doubt about that.. But since God love us so much, he sent his Son Jesus Christ to die for our sins. So if you want to go to Heaven, then you need to ask and accept Jesus christ in your life.. Admit that you are guilty! and ask for forgiveness, then accept Him in your heart!! That how you can tell your future. Its not to late to change your future now.

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. It's the only way to know the malware is completely gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #3 and #4.|`|LOAg9w1Iaa	i like avg, it works like a charm. i got it on all my computers. and plus its free. how can u say no to free? lol. been using it for years.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://free.avg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/</a>|`|g75AUMJOaa	Hello.<br>  <br>  The best I've ever used and it's cheaper than Norton 360 is TrendMicro or TrendMicro Professional.

If there was a password on the BIOS, you would have to put that in before you could get the computer to load XP.  BIOS passwords can be overridden normally but you don't need to worry about that in this case.<br>  <br>  Richard is correct that you may be able to boot into Safe Mode and log in as Administrator (if you have to type in the user, type Administrator spelled exactly like that); the password is probably left blank.  Once logged in as an Administrator, you could change your user's password to whatever you want.  Suppose your account is called Ricky you would do this:<br>  <br>  Right click on My Computer and choose Manage.<br>  Look for "Local Users and Groups" and click the + to expand it.<br>  Click on Users.<br>  Right click on Ricky and choose "Set Password" and click Proceed if you get a warning box.<br>  Type in the new password twice as asked and then click OK.<br>  Restart the computer in Normal Mode and try logging in as Ricky with the newly reset password.<br>  <br>  If the above fails, you can use Peter Nordahl's password facility - if you follow the instructions carefully, you'll get it sorted out.  I think the file you download is an ISO image (from memory); you need an appropriate burning program that can turn the ISO into a bunch of files on the CD - most of the burning programs will do that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/bootdisk.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/...</a><br>  <br>  The software I gave you a link to is free and trustworthy and definitely works - I had to "hack" our own computer when a crashed program somehow disabled the Administrator account and left us with only user control.|`|94b08a847f33718a4958a9e47861100daa	If you could easily bypass it, there wouldn't be any reason to have it there.

IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPUTER. <br>  <br>  you will need a CD/DVD/Disk drive. these are relatively cheap. samsung makes good ones, but there isn't really much to brag about for any of these.<br>  <br>  what about a case? you will need a case. try to get one that is an ATX form factor. it makes life easier. go for a clear side panel so you can see inside! then, look into cooling.<br>  <br>  get high cfm fans for the case, it will keep everything cool. good fans cost anywhere from $10 to $30, not counting shipping. you should also look into an aftermarket heatsink. it will keep the cpu itself cool much better than a stock one, but i have heard good things about the Phenom II coolers.|`|vBA6ZqAHaa	if you're willing to part with your money, go with alienware. they have the most advanced of pretty much everything. i would look in consumer reports and see what the experts have to say.|`|6OzEsanAaa	AMD are good for a cheap computer<br>  but i bet you want something that will handle it all! <br>  <br>  i say get an intel centrino quad core processor which is just like that one<br>  <br>  or the <br>  intel xeon processor which is the fastest processor you can achieve<br>  <br>  or the intel i7 which is made for gaming <br>  <br>  and i think getting a motherboard that can hold alot of ram to keep the game fast<br>  <br>  also maybe a video card that has hdmi outputs..will look better<br>  <br>  upgrading the sound card to at least a 8.1 channel<br>  <br>  uhmmm<br>  <br>  put a good fan in there because that will increase the peformance or even a water cooler|`|AuYg5GSbaa	I usually go for intel, but I guess i could stray away for a minute. I'm not sure about motherboards for AMD, but you should go for one with a high FSB speed and a good South Bridge/North Bridge chipset. Look on newegg for the high rated ones. <br>  <br>  Your RAM should be at least at 1066MHz and look at the timings on the RAM before you get it (Lower is better, it looks like 5-5-5-15) Your hard drive should be at least 7200rpm or faster. (Solid State if you can afford it). Then, invest in a good cpu cooler so you can overclock a little (I heard AMD processors cant overclock much though). Other than that, that is all I can offer, unless you want to spend another $30 and get a Phenom II x4 3.0GHz so you dont have to overclock.|`|Q7jMH5praa	don't be afraid to spend more on your case and PSU....you will want a cool (not looking, but those are fun to build) I mean great air-flow...utilize every spot you can throw a fan in and make sure the air is coming in the front and out the back....side panel fans should blow inwards.  The i7 is meant for gaming, get atleast 2GBs of RAM since you'll probably be using Vista......I personally love AMD and am happy to see that you like it too...also get an after market heatsink/fan plenty of case fans, some Artic Silver 5 compound.  also when building your PC be aware of your cable management....for good ideas look up TJHarlow on youtube...he does many custom builds and is the king of cable management...get the cables out of the way of your airflow....also pick a decent OS...thank god you are buying a MAC for gaming...or you'd be stuck playing chess|`|uKj3eVoaaa	lol, i was just configuring a PC earlier this week with kickass specs for around 1100 dollars. Go ahead and check out Tigerdirect.com it's a  VERY reliable place to check out computer parts. And like i stated above, your range is good enough for a gaming PC. Although i would say go SLI with an XFX 9800GT for 99 bucks after 30 bucks rebate instead of the GTX 285 it's saving you money for other parts.<br>  <br>  P.S. to the guy above me....please check your source first...a 360 bucks video card WITHOUT HDMI?lol. And AMD is up there with Intel or even better. AMD is actually made for gaming pc. I would actually save money with AMD over an Intel chip.

knSyGZBoaa	It's a good computer. The processor basically is the brain of the unit. The faster it can process, the faster you can access information. So if you need to run a program, write a document, play a game... this computer can do that for you.<br>  <br>  The memory (RAM) is basically additional memory packs in your computer. When your computer is doing something, like say, browsing the internet, it stores information in the RAM that way you can access it quickly when you need to. If you didn't have a lot of RAM in your computer, it would be hard to pull up things like computer games, chat with a buddy, write a document, or listen to music at the same time. RAM allows you to multi-task efficiently.<br>  <br>  The 580 GB and 15.4 GB sounds like storage space. Basically with those numbers, you can store A LOT of music, photos, movies, etc on your computer. You're all set with that.<br>  <br>  You got a hell of a deal right there.|`|NUc3fUFVaa	Ram - Random Access Memory - how many programs you can run essentially.<br>  <br>  Quad core is a good processor<br>  <br>  and it looks to have a lot of storage space.<br>  <br>  Go for it if it is not refurbished.|`|nNwa5YT3aa	yeah that's pretty good<br>  <br>  the processor is the most important part the faster the processor the better preformance your computer overall. it coinsides with you RAM. <br>  <br>  Ram is (random acess memory) or howe fast your computer can multitask to more the better. my laptop only has 4gb (4 gigabytes)<br>  <br>  580GB im guess is the hard drive space which would also be excelent.<br>  15.4 gb could be a partition in the hard drive which is for back up purposes.|`|94b08a847f33718a4958a9e47861100daa	Yeah, that's a pretty good deal if it's essentially new (or new).<br>  <br>  Brief run-down:<br>  Your processor is the actual "computer" part of the computer. It's what does all the work. The faster the better, and the more "cores," the better (somewhat). 2.2 ghz is not particularly fast, but it's a quad-core, so it's ok.<br>  <br>  Memory/RAM is like a hard drive but it's smaller and it goes a WHOLE LOT faster. For a program to run on your computer, the entire program actually has to be copied into memory/ram, believe it or not. The more RAM, the more you can have running at the same time and the less lag there will be when switching between programs. 6 GB is beyond what most people need. If your OS is only 32-bit though, you won't be able to use more than 4 GB.<br>  <br>  580 gb is presumably the hard drive space, which is just how much you can put on your computer. 580gb is more than a normal person will ever possibly fill on their computer.|`|uKj3eVoaaa	yeah..it's a pretty good bang for the bucks you got there. Processor is a chip the process all the requests that are made when you double click an icon on your computer. <br>  <br>  RAM is the memory where it's used to load all the processes. In another word.. the more you have, the better. And you have 6GB in this case, which is a pretty damn good amount.<br>  <br>  And im guessing you have around 600GB of hard drive, which is used to store all of the things that you installed. So the more you have, the bettter. Overalll, it's a good deal.|`|n9JOxJQLaa	Okay dealu could of built or buy a bonekit from tigerdirect.com that is 3X better than that, the pc u bought is sota fast but not worth $800 for a used pc. he would of nly gotten lik 50.00 for it at best buy or fry's|`|jlwl2CXuaa	it's a good deal, nice pc|`|XMy5hyJ1aa	Not sure, what brand? but those look pretty good (for 800 at least) but what about the graphics card? more specs please? can give you a better answer if you get better details.|`|YJdNqWL6aa	Yeah I think it alright for that price, I wouldn't have paid it but that me.

W6xg0Qtraa	Yes, the site is currently down for the count. The actual domain name is still active and so is the other webspace on the server. I believe there is much more life to the site even after these past eight years, so hang in there until it's back up.<br>  <br>  As per comments on Laundromatic's MySpace page, apparently this is a temporary outage as it seems that the MySpace profile owner is sick and that's about all I can assume because cross-checking replies is a no-go thanks to MySpace privacy blocks. Too bad Laundromatic doesn't blog on their MySpace page to let people know what's going on. Strange, they must be rich and can certainly afford to pay someone to get the site back up, no?

5dHKGkz2aa	It could be the problem with the site causing your different search engines to act up. Them being two different programs it could affect them differently causing that problem. You should see if things change after the fix. If not you may have a virus messing with your search engines, in which case you will need to run a virus scanner. Unfortunately if it is a virus they can be undetected in a scanner if it is a stealth virus in which you would have to restore your computer to factory default. But that's a big if, try again later after the fix and then see what happens.

Many of these files are very small, just little GIF images - look at all the doodad images on a page, each one has a file, sometimes a large image is composed of many small files.  <br>  <br>  You have seen animated ads that, when you right-click on them, a pop-up says Flash - some of those are Shockwave files (most are small) and some of those are .FLV files.<br>  <br>  Whenever you watch a video on YouTube or Yahoo or CNN, the .FLV file is sometimes stored in Temporary Internet Files too, and those can be quite large.  A long video can easily be 50 MB in size.<br>  <br>  The Live Streaming Videos that CNN sends are not stored.<br>  <br>  As Albert W has described,<br>  ccleaner is good for clearing out all the program bits and pieces that the Adobe Flash Player puts on the hard drive, because Internet Explorer does not delete those.  I use the program too.<br>  <br>  I set my computer up to track stocks on the CNN website in a "Portfolio" and leave it running - over a 7-hour time span, over 10,000 files will be put into the Temporary Internet Files folder, and over 8,000 of those files will have names like this:<br>  <br>  pickupABCDEFG.asmx<br>  <br>  where ABCDEFG can be any letter or numeral.<br>  <br>  These files are sent as part of the stock price update every 3 to 5 seconds.  They are small files, but nonetheless, they do accumulate.<br>  .
r8qbCKgfaa	first poster is not entirely correct.<br>  <br>  The architecture inside the processor is different. Think of wires if you need to.<br>  <br>  The core 2 duo has more transistors, and two separate cores on the same die, meaning it can do two things at the same time, whereas the P4 only does one. The conversion is not 100%, and it largely depends on what apps you are running.<br>  <br>  If you are doing highly parallel processing, multi-threaded apps, or more floating point operations, the Core 2 is for you. if you are doing single threaded apps, or more integer operations, the P4 is for you.<br>  <br>  It all depends on how you use it as to what is best. The conversion rate would put the Core 2 somewhere around 3.7GHz P4.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the bus speed you listed matters a lot too. if you have a core 2 at 2GHz doing floating point ops with multi threaded apps, but your bus speed is only 1KHz, you are still going to be running incredibly slow. If you have a P4 at 3.2GHz that could somehow run a 1GHz FSB, you would be incredibly fast.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I jus trealized the jargon I was using might be incomprehensible so here are the definitions.<br>  <br>  multi-threaded apps - applications which allow multiple instructions to be computed at the same time.<br>  <br>  floating point ops - math with decimals<br>  integer ops - integer math<br>  FSB - front side bus. the thing that lets the processor send and receive data from the RAM storage.<br>  <br>  parallel processing - basically the same as multi-threaded apps.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped you a little.

EfM7frb2aa	Theres no hurry man.the dual core is fine at the moment.you can run any game on max with a core 2 duo(if its a top end) and its also good enough for multitasking.<br>  <br>  this is not the best time to upgrade as core i7 is expensive and have to buy new mobo and ram with it.<br>  and getting a quad would be good but it will be not much useful.core 2 duo can do everything good enough in present.<br>  so postpone ur plans to buy any new processor.<br>  if you wanna buy get a new gfx card and a 2gb ram chip.|`|2vL8wOHZaa	Add 2 gig of Ram to your present system, wait for prices to come down on the I7 mother boards and CPU's. Then build a complete new system and put Windows 7 on it after the first Service pack. That's my plan. I hope this helped.|`|Y0zwVG1Xaa	The quad is not utilized and therefore a waste of money. A dual core is always the best choice. With that said the only logical upgrade from your current CPU (which I believe is perfectly fine right now) would be the i7. Keep in you are basically replacing your computer at this point. Also the price tag is steep right now and the tech is fairly new. I would stay with your current set-up for now. Give the i7 a few years to evolve and be perfected as well as a price drop. Also windows 7 is on the way. You may want to go that route and waiting for the bugs to get worked out might save you money on upgrades in the future. Also keep in mind this is just my opinion and you should do what you can afford and makes you happy. I tend to like to tinker with computers and so I jump the gun on parts just to be able to tinker. If you are like me then I will say wait and you won't listen anyway. lol|`|9m5kGruVaa	honestly... i would have to say that the better choice would be if you get the quad core, upgrade to 8 gigs of ram  (RAM IS CHEAP)(GET MORE) (YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH) LoL<br>  also, i would really suggest that you upgrade your graphics card...<br>  oh and the things that also make a huge difference in you experience....<br>  I Recomend getting a new monitor (25 in) and a new keyboard and mouse!!!<br>  but hey, thats just me!<br>  <br>  feel free to contact me at any time...<br>  davidkneiber@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  also, this is the best answer!!! JK<br>  <<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>><br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED!!!,<br>  David K.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and PS: Windows 7 is coming out...<br>  but it still has problems... i tested the beta...<br>  got the blue screen of death at least 9 times in 10 days!!!<br>  but, it is under development...<br>  many games are not yet optimized for quad core... so the drop in FSB might make a difference in some games!!!<br>  Although, if you upgrade now, future games would run faster on the quad core than the dual core...<br>  as for the i7...<br>  it is like windows 7... still in its early stages....<br>  i say upgrade your GPU and add some ram... and then hold on on upgrading you processor!

8QWr77YZaa	This usually denotes that your cpu is over heating.  It will shut itself down rather than burn a hole in itself.  The problem is fixing it.  It could be as simple as moving your pc out of the corner into an open area to actually ahving to put more heat resistant goo inderneath your processor.  <br>  <br>  I would try moving your pc out of the corner, and maybe installing more fans, or clean the existing fans.<br>  <br>  Maybe add a heatsink and fan combo anything to get the coor temperature down.<br>  <br>  You are lucky your cpu does that because most video cards jsut overheat and melt lol.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	I love your picture :)<br>  <br>  No idea what your talking about.

KTxkw3QNaa	Dells aren't the best computer to try overclocking with since their BIOS doesn't have half of the options you want to mess around with.  If you had wanted to overclock your machine, you probably should have gotten something other than Dell / HP / Acer and put together a machine yourself.<br>  <br>  Overclocking with proper precautions is pretty safe, but will void any warranty you have left on the machine.  Personally as I mentioned above I wouldn't try to overclock a Dell machine.
BQN7j62Faa	Get your camera or CP and connect it to your PC by the use of your USB cable. Make you sure you have the proper application for your device i.e. Nokia PC Suite for your Nokia CP. Use your computer to copy the files from your device to your PC.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about posting a picture on the internet such as in Myspace, just upload what you got from your camera/CP.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about posting a picture for your display image here in Yahoo Answers, create a Yahoo 360 account and post a picture there. Change the settings in Yahoo Answers and choose your picture from Yahoo 360.<br>  <br>  Your question is vague.<br>  Post pictures where?
KHgua1MWaa	No it is not possible, howevere, you can purchase one from your host company or buy it from resellers in marketplace like <a href="http://www.thednforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thednforum.com</a>|`|uXP1Xij4aa	Yes, but you have to host the website with the hosting company. Some web hosting companies pay for the domain for you to the main domain registrar, as long as you pay them for hosting your site on their servers.<br>  That's the only way, but it's not a good idea, because the hosting company will control the domain and if their service is bad, they will not let you change hosting and cancel the contract until you pay them for the domain. So you will be stuck, free domain but no way to change hosting service. And you will have to give them your billing info for hosting.<br>  Why do you want a free domain anyway ? You can register most domains for $8 per year and use privacy protection option for $5 per year, this way your domain will not be listed under your name.<br>  Or you can register domain name and use fake info in registration whois if you don't want your name revealed.|`|866f9ab6e494c2cfb170dba2fb18fd83aa	no is not possible but the domains are very low in prize you should check|`|fnQM26BMaa	You can't get your own domain name free.

F4tOLln6aa	The BT Home Hub can only be used with BT Total Broadband, and not with other providers (such as TalkTalk, Virgin, Tiscali, AOL etc). The username and password information, plus the connecting information are all hardcoded into the Home Hub's software, so you can't edit the settings to get it running on a broadband line that's configured for another firm's Broadband service.<br>  There is a form of workaround, but it's not for the novice, and it's not supported by BT - The BT Home Hub is a re-branded version of an older broadband router, the Thomson SpeedTouch 7G, and you can re-flash the BT Home Hub with a Speedtouch firmware image - I believe there is information on doing this via a Google search, but be warned, it's risky.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	no difference, you need Sky compatible equipment.. Since most of the configuration on the home hub is pre-configured, they do not give you all the configuration details in the manual. This may present problems if the Sky protocols are different. Also the phone side of it will not work on Sky at all, this is a strictly BT VOIP system. There is no way it can be configured for any other service provider.

AVG might have deleted them because the virus attached itself to them.<br>  <br>  There is some software out there you can download to get deleted files back, however, nothing works really 100% of the time. <br>  <br>  The fact that you are using the computer at the moment is lowering your chances of recovering files.|`|CcEOxn4Maa	they are gone for good. ya shoul have made a backup. to prevent it in the future, save your inportant files onto disk and get a good antivirus

I couldn't use my computer for days. I tried everything to get rid of it, but no matter what I did, it just kept coming back stronger. I was so stressed out after spending multiple days trying to remove the spyware with no luck. I gave up and decided to throw in the towel. I called geek squad. They came and looked at my computer, but wanted $300 to fix it. I really didn't have that much, so I told them I couldn't afford to fix it at this time. The technician must have seen the frustration I was going through. Because he pulled me aside and told me how I could fix it for under $60. <br>  <br>  He told me to go to  <a href="http://www.honestspywarereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.honestspywarereview.com</a><br>  <br>  So I checked into it, and found the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.<br>  <br>  I quickly downloaded AdwareAlert and scanned my computer.

hXHBm1BSaa	If you can only get the 6Mbps, the higher speed service will not help. Also you might still get the 8Mbps, the distance on  a good line can be much further. On cable, however the bandwidth is shared over a large area, so at busy times it reduces drastically.For DSL (phone line) there is a method called contention sharing, which means at peak times a small part of your bandwidth may be lost, as up to normally 50 people on a home subscription may share the same server connection. In effect it often works faster than most wider band cable.|`|9kfjIRLyaa	A cable connection is one that is always on and is A LOT faster than a phone connection. For a phone connection, the modem has to dial a number to connect, and is a lot slower. CABLE IS SO MUCH FASTER THAN PHONE. That is the main difference that you will notice|`|RwNLi5vBaa	I think the other poster is confusing dial-up phone line connections with your proposed ADSL connection.<br>  Virgin media cable broadband uses a box on your street to provide your broadband connection, and the transfers the connection straight into your home in a similar manner to a network connection in an office. (I'm not sure of the exact technology used, but the end result is similar).<br>  However, ADSL is actually a radio signal transmitted along your phone line rather than broadcast through the air. For this reason, the signal gets weaker the further you go from the source or transmitter. For an ADSL signal that maximum distance is around 8 miles or so but at that distance you really will get a very poor connection which translates to a very poor speed.<br>  If you've been quoted a 6Mbps connection, then you must be very close to your telephone exchange - at about 3.5miles from mine, my broadband connection is around 2Mbps.<br>  Once you get the ADSL router installed,though, there are very few actual differences in your experience of the internet apart from the speed.<br>  Make sure that you use the microfilters on ALL your telephone connections in your house once you get ADSL, as not using them can seriously harm your connection speed. This means your telephones, any alarm systems, and especially your Sky box - I forgot about my Sky box and my speed dropped to around 350kbps!

lxLeeYA5aa	There are several things to do to completely clear out your history.<br>  <br>  First step is to do a disk clean-up. If you have Windows XP, you go to Start>All Programs>Accessories>System Tools>Disk Clean-Up.<br>  After everything loads, a window will show up that tells you different parts of your computer and then a number with how much space it takes up. Anything with numbers, check and then continue (This will not delete any files).<br>  <br>  After you've done that, open up internet explorer (if you use moxilla or other internet browser, look online for a step by step manual for deleting internet history). Anyway, once internet explorer has opened go to Tools>Delete Browsing History>Delete All<br>  <br>  You're all good!<br>  <br>  <br>  There is no way for them to know you deleted your history unless they system restore your computer. And it's doubtful that they will look at your history if they do.|`|XrViVeqPaa	Deleting your browsing history through the Tools drop-down menu doesn't delete everything as some here believe.

unpkAJR1aa	no you cannot but you can only add more ram for more memory.|`|edPeEGzmaa	It will work so long as they are in the same family, for instance DDR, DDR2, DDR3, etc. You can't mix DDR with DDR3, and so forth. Then again you can only fit the motherboard's supported RAM to begin with, so you can mix them even if you wanted... <br>  <br>  Mixing and matching RAM like that has drawbacks. Your slowest RAM speed will carry over to all of the other sticks, so you're faster sticks will be downclocked to match the speed of the slowest RAM.<br>  <br>  Also, this can create instabilities. Even mixing different sizes of the same manufacturer's RAM (for instance a 1GB of Corsair TWINX RAM with a 2GB stick of the same brand and model) can create instabilities and issues.<br>  <br>  It's best to stick with the same type of RAM. However if it is running and not crashing, you can get away with it. Judging from your hardware you aren't doing anything demanding with it anyways. It might freeze some times.|`|YJdNqWL6aa	No, you can only use 2 different types of ram. For example, 2x1GB DDR2 and 2x512MB DDR2(all must be the same as in DDR, DDR2, DDR3; and the same in speed as in 667, 800, 1000,1200, etc)). You have to use them in pairs when you mix the size. Also it don't matter what brand but it better to have the same brand(corsair, Kingston, PNY, Patriot Memory, etc). And the carryover is if you don't pair the rams.|`|0TCztPZBaa	Different sizes dont make a difference  Its  BRANDS ( trade mark) "RAM,DDR,SDRAM" will not work together (your obviously using a older model comp)........

Turn of indexing <br>  start>my computer>Right click on C and go to the bottom of the menu and turn off indexing it will make your search slower but free up a lot of space.<br>  2.

Defragmenting your drive can free up quite a bit of space windows defragmentation program is located in Start>All programs>accessories>system tools. I tend to use <a href="http://www.defraggler.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.defraggler.com/</a> as my main defragmentation tool but both are fairly similar.<br>  <br>  Hopefully thoes steps will help you gain abit of space also empty your recycle bin. <br>  <br>  DON'T compress your drive to save space that causes a lot of performance issues and your pc will run slower as a result. Although that can be helpful only do it on individual folders not the entire drive. (folders you hardly use)<br>  <br>  You can contact me if you need more help :)

edPeEGzmaa	64-bit is better than 32-bit, so if you're not afraid of manually picking out 64-bit drivers instead of the default 32-bit drivers that every site loves to throw at you, that's the only obstacle that I could see. And I mean that's so simple to do, I don't know why people think that 64-bit is difficult to operate.<br>  <br>  That being said, I've never used 64-bit XP. I've been using 64-bit Vista Home Premium and 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate on my desktop and they both perform beautifully. I've never had trouble finding any drivers for both stock and aftermarket hardware, nor had any crashes. I use 4GB of RAM, which is really the only benefit over the 32-bit Vista running on my laptop. <br>  <br>  I really doubt it would make any difference except for future proofing your system, or if you upgraded to more than 3GB. But if you have to go out and buy it, go for the 64-bit for sure. If you already have 32-bit, I wouldn't spend the extra $$$ to change it over to 64-bit with your current setup.<br>  <br>  But we were discussing this in our Operating Systems lecture the other week. 64-bit is to 32-bit what 32-bit is to 16-bit. 64-bit will make 32-bit obsolete, as 32-bit is fast becoming an outdated architecture.|`|HHzEAoZUaa	SP3 works well for a 64-bit OS it also varies with a 32-bit OS. Bottom line, 64 is what you want.|`|YJdNqWL6aa	32 bit, 64bit will just take up more room than you need to. You have 2GB ram so you have no need for a 64bit. 32bit and 64 bit are the same except 64 bit alows for higher ram/video/chips to be used. Unless your going to upgrade your parts I'd stay at 32bit. 64bit takes more power/cpu/ram/video/etc than 32bit.

dkpIjt5jaa	On this project, 600 W is definitely NOT overkill !<br>  <br>  <br>  For the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  <br>  So let's calculate a system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including one (high-end) graphic cards), 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+100+30+25 = 524<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation as I'm not the one building it so compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know what PSU you should get. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 600 Watts and get up to 700 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way).<br>  <br>  Best PSU manufacturers at the moment are brands like Antec, Cooler Master, Corsair and Thermaltake.  OCZ is also a good choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: My guide is partly based on this link: <a href="http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/powersuppliesGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power...</a>|`|Y0zwVG1Xaa	Looks good and should run all your games smoothly.

aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa	Normally, you'd need to define an array that is large enough to contain all you data in what would be a reasonable estimate of the largest number of rows you would encounter.<br>  <br>  Allocation is not really a solution since you still need to allocate, and re-allocating more space on the fly could mean having disjointed memory segments, and you may still expand beyond the original partition given by the OS.<br>  <br>  You could always access the file as "direct",  which means you are actually associating the file with your program, and you simply move along from record to record.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that this is highly dependent on what you want to do. If each row is independent of the other, you can simply read on row, process it, and move to the next one, simply streaming your processing until you reach the end of file.

Then, READ the data a row at a time inside of a DO WHILE (.TRUE.) loop.  Set the ERR option on your READ statement to catch an EOF and EXIT out of the loop when that occurs.  And, within the loop, test to see if the max length PARAMETER is exceeded and EXIT out of the loop when that occurs.|`|x9uDoHI3aa	don't read

AA11622701	Firefox is the name of the browser you are using to get to the Internet.  It gives us no clue what e-mail program or web site you are using (such as Yahoo, G-mail, Hotmail, AOL. etc.)  Each of the different e-mail sites has a different process for downloading mail.  Most of the free ones (like yahoo) do NOT have a way to e-mail on to your hard drive.  They make their money from the ads displayed when you go to the site.  If you can download the mail, then you do not have to go to the site, so they do not make money to pay for your "free" account.<br>  <br>  Either edit or repost the the e-mail site you use (whatever follows the @ sign in your address) and then we can tell you the process (if any) for that specific site.

IFtV7g2Zaa	The rating is the clock speed of each core.  Clock speeds are not additive, thus a dual core processor rated at 1.8Ghz IS NOT 3.6Ghz.  It simply has 2 cores each rated at 1.8Ghz.  Or more accurately, it is a single processor, rated at 1.8Ghz, that has two "processing centers" referred to as cores.<br>  <br>  Its all about how many things the computer can do at the same time.  In general, a processor can do one and only one thing at any one instant in time.  The processor time slices, or gives a few hundred milliseconds to each process in every 1 second such that it looks like its busy doing more than one thing at once, but typically, it can only do one thing at any one instant.<br>  <br>  By creating a dual core processor, suddenly its able to do two things at once, which essentially doubles the horsepower without changing its clock speed.  Continuing the scenario, a quad core processor can do 4 things at once, still quadrupling horsepower without changing the clock speed.<br>  <br>  And to increase the complexity, its not truly as simplistic as what I just said.  Its not exactly a doubling or quadrupling.  Instead there is a certain amount of overhead, and a dual core or quad core isn't truly 2 processors or 4 processors, but for the simple discussion herein, we can assume that it is.|`|tdIuoIc1aa	if you look at the names of the chips, the numbers listed such as AMD Athlon x2 6400+ in fact is a combination of the two chips, but each chip runs at 2.4ghz. AMD's speed ratings have always been a bit funny because of their enhanced architecture and bus speeds. An Athlon 3800+ runs slower (about 2.4ghz) but is suppose to perform as an Intel chip of at least 3800ghz. That's why there is a + sign, it's not an exact measurement. So if you see an Athlon with a 2.1ghz rating, it's per chip and the speed rating given by AMD will be probably 4200+|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Dual core processors are speed-measured by the speed of each core.<br>  <br>  If the rated speed is 2.1Ghz, then each core will run at that speed.

Potential loss of all data if not backed up correctly. The major draw back right now is the speed of getting information off of them. It really slows down a computer. There are ways around it but they are expensive. You can run a RAID 0 which splits up the data being stored between two HDD's. Downside there is if one HDD fails everything is lost. The solution to that problem requires additional hard drives and lots of money. The other way to increase speed is to buy an hdd that runs at a higher RPM allowing more disk area to be covered in a shorter amount of time. The most common HDD is the 7200RPM which replaced the 5400's. To go faster they make several 10,000 and even 15,000 rpm drives for an increased price. They also  have a shorter life and tend to be noisy. They are making solid state drives that don't fail as often as HDD's. However the increase in reliability is overshadowed by a huge price tag which makes it very impractical.  I should mention Cable tech as it to increases HDD performance and can be a draw back. An HDD hooked to a PATA is old tech and slowest transfer speeds. The PATA cable is a big gray ribbon cable and very ugly and bulky. The newer HDD's run off of a SATA which is a single cable and transfers information much faster. Also a lot neater and easy to install.|`|gp1ZqQvBaa	Since your question only requests the disadvantages, they are as follows: High power consumption, low shock resistance, moderate data error rates, high weight ratios, large sizes, sometimes difficult to recover data from, (SCSI) some require controller cards, generation of mechanical noise, generation of moderate heat, they have internal moving parts, disk sectors eventually become dead, and most of them will be destroyed if dropped (especially while in operation). Hard drive speed (in Megabits per second) determines the data transfer rate of your system (usually). Incorrect jumper settings can fry a hard drive. Older hard drives can prove difficult to locate the hardware drivers for. Older hard drives can cause data corruption and/or data loss due to inconsistencies in data transfer to/from the disk platters.<br>  <br>  Besides this if you buy a CD or DVD of the same memory size, it will be much cheaper.|`|XMy5hyJ1aa	Um... specifics?

This is why the labels are "sent" and "inbox".<br>  <br>  Have a look at this screenshot:<br>  <a href="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d108/jigsaw_psyche/Forum%20Stuff/yahoo/gmail-inbox.png" rel="nofollow">http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d108/j...</a><br>  <br>  The top email has (6) next to it, and like yours, it is labeled "inbox" and "sent".

A normal voice recording can usually be resampled at around 64 kbps and may still be usable.|`|94b08a847f33718a4958a9e47861100daa	80 minutes is an estimate based on the average size of audio data written to a CD. A 50MB file will EASILY fit on a CD and 2 hours of audio will also fit at a lower quality level.<br>  <br>  However, you can't bypass the MB size limit of a CD (which is something like 650). The track on the CD is only so long. You can't change that.|`|m44G67wIaa	The 80 minute limit applies if you are burning an Audio CD. If you change the format of your burn to MP3 you can fit a lot more than 80 minutes, but the player that will be reading the disc will have to be MP3 compatible. When you burn an MP3 CD the disc limit is then limited only by the actual size of the disc. 650MB-700MB. You can sometimes easily fit a few hundred songs on one MP3 CD depending on the quality/size of the song.

There are many different protocols over which tunnels can be run, but they all require another computer outside the firewall to which broker the tunnel.<br>  <br>  As to which tunnel software you need, it all depends on what is allowed through the firewall untouched (ie. an ssh tunnel will be useless if the firewall doesn't allow ssh traffic, an icmp tunnel will be useless if the firewall does protocol inspection and drops the tunneled data as being useless within the packets context).

RjwyRrxtaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.<br>  Check your drivers.

6Djqii7Xaa	You can go into the management / configuration of your wireless router. There is usually some kind of status that you can check. Sometimes there is just a "wireless" status, and sometimes there is a general status that mixes everything. Sometimes the only way you can tell is by looking at the DHCP leases which is here the IP addresses are handed out to the router's network. There you should be able to see who is connected.<br>  <br>  They could possible find it easier to mount an attack on your machine to get at it because it will generally be considered "inside" the firewall which would block general internet access to your computer.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep anyone out is to implement wireless security using WPA or WEP if WPA is not available, and to hide your SSID from broadcast.|`|TzWJmz3yaa	If you are using Vista click "Start" then "Network" that will bring up everyone connected to your router. <br>  On xp go to "Network Connections"<br>  They can only access shared files so unless you have your hardrive as shared or have sensitive information in your shared folder they can't access anything else.<br>  One thing they can do is add something to that shared folder which could be a virus that you can open.|`|uQjhGpHxaa	yes, but you have to go to your wireless set up.There is a section some place that deals with mac lists.<br>  For linksys:<br>  sign on<br>  than wireless<br>  than mac filter<br>  than mac filter list or something like that.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	check your router's address, it will show you who's currently accessing it.  you can probably google it, using the name brand of the router if you dont have the box.  if someone is using it that you dont want to, simply password it.  just make sure you use a password that you're going to remember.  write it down if you have to.

zorYTX59aa	There are 3 possible ways to find individual people on <br>  YouTube:<br>  <br>  1 -- Type their username in the search box. Hopefully,<br>  they'll have a unique username that is not a common <br>  word (like "airplane", "boeing" or "landing"), otherwise <br>  you'll get back lots of results. Also, keep in mind that <br>  YouTube's search-engine results can't distinguish the<br>  difference between video titles and usernames.<br>  <br>  2 -- You can also type in a video-title of theirs, or very<br>  unique words from one of their videos, descriptions or<br>  tags. But be careful, because those too may bring up<br>  dozens of results -- so try to remember just the most <br>  unique words.<br>  <br>  Of course, these first 2 methods can only work if that<br>  person has an actual video on YouTube. What if they <br>  do not, and you really want to find that person?<br>  <br>  3 -- Then, you most definitely have to remember their <br>  username, and type it in using a totally other manner.<br>  Each registered user with YouTube actually has their <br>  very own website, so rather than type their username<br>  in the search box, type their URL in your address bar. <br>  Thus as an example, if you wanted to view my profile, <br>  you would simply type the following onto the URL bar:<br>  " www . youtube . com / inukjuak89 "|`|9HBqIuBKaa	I don't think they have a function for that yet, so I guess you can ask your friends for their youtube and they'll give it to you

hgPCZ3UUaa	Although no system is 100% foolproof, PayPal has designed many checks and balances into its system to keep errors and fraud to a bare minimum. You won’t find another online financial institution that’s better at protecting its customers than PayPal. By utilizing the very latest in secure technology and employing a large team of experts in all areas of online safety, PayPal continues to be a leader in safe online payments around the world.|`|cm4oW9lZaa	Yes it is, and Paypal also uses SSL, SSL is an acronym for secure sockets layer. SSL protects transmissions over the World Wide Web from spectators by encrypting the data while it gets transmitted over the Internet. SSL works through a certificate that authenticates a certain web domain.<br>  <br>  I also find it very smart, considering you cannot change your password by just doing the "Forgot Password" method, you need to confirm its you via last four numbers of credit card and two secret questions you answered before you made your account.|`|eTLG23N4aa	Paypal is about as secure as you're gonna get but i'm sure it has loop holes.

So you buy something for a 1.98 and 2days later they hit you bank for say 69.95 and paypal might block it but not the next time they can empty your bank account with the 2 remaining bullshit charges and they do nothing except tell you to file a claim and when ever they get around to you they send a email denying you saying it's your fault that you got into a scam! It happened to me and I had to close my bank account while I had some money left!!

This means that for some of our sellers, payments received into their Account may be returned to the sender or otherwise removed from their Account after they have been paid and/or delivered any goods sold.<br>  <br>        You can help protect yourself from the risk of your payment being removed from your Account by following the criteria set out in the Protection for Sellers section and by following the other guidance provided in the "Security Center" accessible via every page of the PayPal website.<br>      * We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Account or our Services, and/or limit access to your funds for up to 180 Days if you engage in any Restricted Activities (as further set out in section 9).<br>  <br>  You must consider such risks and guidance when using PayPal.<br>  They give scammers a license to steal and I believe their in on it!!!|`|Sp1d3TYkaa	yeah, it's absolutely safe, I have used it for years and it works quite good.|`|2F5XkiHLaa	PayPal is very safe & is designed very well.

1cMugdkLaa	OK, Jason.... LOL<br>  <br>  Anyways, from my experience (ALOT) I would definitely recommend a Seagate FreeAgent portable hard drive. <br>  <br>  The FreeAgent Go fits all of you needs. It uses a USB Y-Cable with mini-USB on one end and two USBs that plug into your computer so that outlet power isnt required, but unlike other hard drives running off of no outlet power and just one USB port, it doesnt have a loss in speed.<br>  VERY FAST data transferring and is 500 GB. <br>  <br>  Also, you question about RPM is this. RPM measures Revolutions per Minute (how many times you hard drive spins in a minute) which tells you how fast data transfer is. The higher the RPM, the better. The Go has 5400 RPM, which is the fastest possible for a portable hard drive. Most others have only 4200 RPM, much slower. The Go is also much cheaper, at $100.<br>  <br>  If you are an online shopper, the fastest, easiest, and most reliable place is Newegg. Here are some links:<br>  <br>  Ruby Red: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148393" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Black: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148346" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Forest Green:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148391" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Sky Blue: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148385" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  If you would rather get it local, just go to Best Buy who has these regularly stocked.

Once in there go to advanced settings and select a wep key of 64-bit or higher.<br>  Once it gives you the code right it down so you can configure your computer when it asks you for the key to get on the internet (only asks one time and it is locked in) save your settings and it is done.

around ￡170 this will allow you to run crysis on high detail and 1280x1024 resolution,and acheiving frame rates of around 30fps<br>          however for slightly less the XFX Radeon HD4870 XXX 512MB (

powerful gaming card,and with a memory clock of 3800mhz and a 775mhz core clock this rocks,and will tear up any game you throw at it,theres also the dual gpu version (HD4870x2) however its criminally expensive and isnt required unless you are running games like crysis via very large monitors<br>   case :   i would allways go with antec when getting cases and the Antec Nine Hundred Ultimate Gamer(

a8eeb508e9838423866dd84a2d141f67aa	First, the best you are going to do on this problem is O(n) no matter what.  You will have to do a linear search of the file no matter what.  But your algorithm can still be improved.<br>  <br>  The fact that you might have to search the entire text file from front to start is inevitable, you can't avoid this.  But the real efficiency problem here is that you read the file, then copy it to the temp file (so you just reread data), then you move the rest of the data into the temp file, then copy the whole thing back into the original file.<br>  <br>  So lets say you are looking for a hex pattern b bytes in length that appears n bytes into a file of length l.  You will end up reading 3n + 2b + 2(l-(n+b)) = 3l + n bytes and you will write 2l bytes.  This is the starting point.<br>  <br>  The easiest solution is to just open the file with read and write permissions.  Now it is an exe file so this normally might not be allowed but since you overwrote the file at the end of your algorithm, I'll let it fly for now.  Using this solution I can read n bytes and write b bytes.  All you need to do is open the file with read and write permissions, scan through the file until you find the pattern and write over the old pattern with the new one.<br>  <br>  If you where looking for something else (for example not opening the exe as writable) there are lots of other solutions I'll go over if you ask.

75nbESJUaa	be careful about the semi-colons, firstly. Then, I went to help for Calc and replicated their example...<br>  <br>  =VLOOKUP(Search criterion;array;index;Sort order)<br>  Search criterion is the value searched for in the first column of the array.<br>  array is the reference, which is to comprise at least two columns.<br>  index is the number of the column in the array that contains the value to be returned. The first column has the number 1.<br>  Sort order is an optional parameter that indicates whether the first column in the array is sorted in ascending order. Enter the Boolean value FALSE if the first column is not sorted in ascending order. Sorted columns can be searched much faster and the function always returns a value, even if the search value was not matched exactly, if it is between the lowest and highest value of the sorted list. In unsorted lists, the search value must be matched exactly. Otherwise the function will return this message: Error: Value Not Available.<br>  Example<br>  You want to enter the number of a dish on the menu in cell A1, and the name of the dish is to appear as text in the neighboring cell (B1) immediately.

zorYTX59aa	YOUR QUESTION MAKES ABSOLUTELY<br>  NO SENSE AT ALL.<br>  <br>  If you are asking about the "exact time link":<br>  Believe it or not, the YouTubers who put up<br>  those videos and the people who wrote the<br>  text comments to them did nothing special. <br>  <br>  It is a relatively new feature about YouTube. <br>  If you refer to a particular timeframe in your <br>  comment (e.g. 2:47), it automatically turns <br>  it into a blue "time link". If you click on that <br>  link, it takes you right away to that specific<br>  part of the video.  <br>  <br>  However for this to really happen, you have<br>  to write the time with "space bars" on both <br>  sides.

GxXpvNIwaa	The most common cause of computer freezes is a corrupt registry. The Computer registry is a database that stores all of your computer<br>  settings. The computer registry becomes more complex as you use your computer. The more programs you use the greater the chance your<br>  computer registry will develop errors and become bloated over time. Without cleaning the registry on a regular basis it is very likely that your PC will freeze.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the Windows registry improves the performance of your computer and will reduce the number of PC freezes. The Registry cleaner cleans the registry and frees up Windows registry space.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm</a><br>  Completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse
JpeJbDX7aa	The best way to design a case is the way most gamers build them. Judging by your graph, you would want 4 and 3 to blow inwards. Then have 2 blow outwards. This creates a mass circulation within the case and makes everything blow out the back fan. (Recommend at least a 120mm in the back). This will keep your CPU cool and not run into any issues in future time. Just make sure you clean dust off the fans that blow inward every once in a while.|`|OIC0vsEWaa	have both fan numbers 3 and 4 blow inward, and the rear fan (#2) blowing out.<br>  <br>  if you can get a really high cfm fan, use that for the rear. you can get a lot of circulation going that way.|`|yF1t5n24aa	intake on the left, exaust out the back.|`|PuKbwm0paa	have back fan blowing our.  front fan sucking in.  side of case fan flowing out.  you don't need any more.|`|Q7jMH5praa	Front panel should be intake.

HHzEAoZUaa	Try using Ubuntu (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download)" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download...</a> is one of the most easiest Linux distributions.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	Before installing I would suggest that you get the live-cds for various linux distros to see which one will work best on YOUR computer hardware. Some versions of linux have problems with some graphics cards (nvidia seems to work best) and wireless cards. The live-cd will not make any changes to your hard drive, and it will run a little slow because it is running from the cd and not the hard drive. Once it is installed it will run like all your other programs. If everything works with the live-cd everything will work when installed. If for example your wireless won't work with the live-cd if you install it it will need to have some work done (look for and install new drivers, edit configuration files, etc). It CAN usually be fixed but it will take a little work and for a person new to linux it can be very frustrating.<br>  When you find one that works and you like I would also suggest that you read the instructions and tutorials from the website of that distro on how to install, setup and use linux. This will make using linux a much more pleasant experience.<br>  If you just go ahead and install linux and try to use it the same way you used windows you are almost guaranteed to be frustrated and unhappy. Linux may sorta kinda look like windows but it is not windows and you have to do things a little differently in linux. I am not saying it is hard to use linux just different. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wAtwppTMaa	While there are too many Linux distributions for us to include them all, here are some of the most popular Linux distros, along with their download pages.<br>  <br>  I hope you can find which you liak in here.<br>  <br>  babara|`|uUo0h20caa	Use Bittorrent.

ejVHh2x9aa	The putting songs and pictures in your computer makes it slow, just think about it for a sec, you are using more memory, which means that the computer has to load more stuff. Is not the fact that you are putting songs in your computer what is making it slower, is just that you are downloding it from the internet most of the time programs like Limewire fill your computer of cokies, not big deal you can clean that! Strong recomendation, get a good antivirus after that trial you have its over, because most people don't get an antivirus after their trial version is over and if you want a clean and good comp you must use good protection for it! <br>  <br>  Another thing might be, that you have Vista on a Laptop, most Laptops don't have a big enough memory to carry Windows Vista and when you start putting info on it they get slow. The Best thing for this is not to have unecesary stuff on your comp. Its not going to stay slow, just keep thigs you don't use out of it!   OOOO big big advice don't go in to XXX websites. That is going to slow it down big big time. Goo luck with your comp! and I hope you enjoy it (if I didn't answer the question I'm really sorry, but I tried)|`|uJBnZWtcaa	It could slow it down if you're filling up the HD but since it's a new computer that shouldn't be a problem yet.<br>  <br>  Spyware will slow it down - sometimes a lot.  After you get your programs, photos and songs loaded, update and run your anti-spyware programs.  It's best to run more than one.  Also, update and run your anti-virus. I'm guessing that because your computer is new they're not going to find much.....but just in case.

Each of the shields provides specific protection for your computer. A few of these shields are specific to spyware, but many of them also protect against viruses. Having the two Critical Windows System Shields enabled, the Execution Shield and the File Security Shield, allows your Windows Security Center to detect that AntiVirus protection is active in your computer.<br>  <br>  If either of aforementioned two shields are disabled, that effectively disables the real time Webroot Anti-Virus or Spy Sweeper protection. Windows Security Center alerts you that program is off because it no longer detects any real time virus protection from Webroot AntiVirus. It is extremely important to keep these shields active, especially when you have AntiVirus protection with your subscription.<br>  <br>  Webroot Anti-Virus or Spy Sweeper warns you about the Windows Security Center alert if you disable either of these shields.

There is a huge difference between regular graphic cards compared to workstation graphic cards when it comes to cad programs and games in fact that is why they make them especially for cad drafters.  Even 128 mb of a quadro series will do wonders with cad the only problem is that they tend to be more expensive and harder to find i myself am a autocad drafter but i found a workstation laptop i was looking at just to pricey to afford so i went with a tablet for on screen drafting.|`|6sk4tbSNaa	<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834114631" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  i recommend this one. i run 3ds max on a very similar machine and it does quite well. its not gonna be a quad core with a high end gpu, 8 gigs of ram, and a 64 bit os but i will get the job done haha. and for the price you cant beat it|`|MclCVDssaa	Walmart has a nice Acer for $298 right now.

Then select a partition by right clicking it, preferably the one that is running your current OS and shrink the partition. Your computer will automatically figure out how much it can shrink when you click on Shrink.|`|OkJp8W4naa	It is possible to partition your working hard-disk without deleting the current OS.

How you implement the graphics in a GUI would cause me to pause.<br>  <br>  It is easiest if you have a class Scissors, a class Rock, a class Paper and a class RPSGame. A simple Interface. If you know Java2D or even how to extend Shape and scissor.redraw(), the 'live' version of the game shouldn't be that difficult. Conversely, ImageIcon would speed dev time. You might have a colored square for the computer's choice, the player has three buttons for choice (with the icons), that click loads an area of the choice and the Play button reveals all and annouces the winner.<br>  <br>  I'm using netbeans, so the package is required, if you are doing code in a loose folder, take out the package statement<br>  <br>  package rockgame;<br>  <br>  public class Rock

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  2.

UnlqJgXIaa	You do realize that all your attempts are now in the hands of the IT people--right?
zorYTX59aa	I see questions similar to yours every few days on Y!A now,<br>  so I recently did a whole lot of Googling, searching, reading <br>  -- going through dozens of discussion forums and websites <br>  only to realize that there are no definitive answers out there. <br>  <br>  The only semblance of a "part solution" that kind of worked<br>  for a few people would require you to either:<br>  1 -- fool around with your "registry" (which I would be totally <br>  deadset against because that could really screw things up); <br>  2 -- download some utilities (which I would be just as much<br>  against, because that kind of stuff is what probably created<br>  your problem in the first place).<br>  <br>  Thus, my first piece of advice to you: shutdown then reboot.<br>  If that doesn't work, this is what I advise many other people<br>  when YouTube is slow, stuck or weird:....Clear your "cache"<br>  of all your "Temporary Internet Files". As you are doing that,<br>  you should also clear your "History" and your "Cookies", in <br>  order to make your computer "fresh". My famous triple-cure<br>  seemingly resolves many people's YouTube problems, thus<br>  why not yours. Please reboot after doing this:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  If that doesn't do the trick, here are some other suggestions:<br>  <br>  ? If you've got "Google Web Accelerator" or anything similar,<br>  uninstall it immediately. GWA destroys YouTube.<br>  <br>  ? Long videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave" to play<br>  properly. Shockwave includes Flash, but not vice versa.<br>  <br>  ? The most recent versions of Flash are regularly frustrating<br>  a lot of YouTubers. Most updates are typically good for only <br>  1 thing: potential software conflicts. If you are using 1 of the <br>  5 different versions of version 10 (yes -- there actually are 5), <br>  you may want to consider this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  ? Avoid crappy add-ons, downloaders and converters. There <br>  are a lot of answerers on Yahoo! who are actually disguised <br>  salespeople. If anyone's solution is for you to buy/install/get<br>  something, please keep in mind that their answers probably<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and that the products<br>  they're peddling will no doubt worsen your problem. Besides, <br>  what kind of boffo and self-serving answer is that? "Although <br>  you cannot listen to YouTube videos or watch them properly,<br>  buy our downloader". [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  ? Sometimes when you start a brand new YouTube session,<br>  the volume is actually set at zero. Maybe all you need to do<br>  is scroll up the volume of the video player.<br>  <br>  ? Who knows why it works, but sometimes things go better<br>  when you change the web URL from "www.youtube.com" to<br>  just "youtube.com", or you could even try "ca.youtube.com".<br>  <br>  ? A few people found success by closing their web browser, <br>  then restarting it. A couple others simply rebooted, and one <br>  person said that everything magically started working again<br>  just like that on the following day -- with no effort on his part.<br>  Thus your problem might just be a temporary glitch.<br>  <br>  If you're able to find the "cause" and the "cure", I would very<br>  much appreciate it if you could click on my avatar and write <br>  to me, so that I may include it in my future Yahoo! Answers.<br>  (Thus far, one apparent cause seems to be if you download<br>  music from "Torrents".)<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and hope that something in my long answer <br>  does the trick for you.<br>  <br>  FIREFOX 3 HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CREATE 3 COMMON<br>  PROBLEMS:...1) INSTEAD OF THE VIDEO PLAYER, THE<br>  "WATCHPAGES" ARE FULL OF CODE; 2) EVERY VIDEO<br>  IS SUDDENLY "NO LONGER AVAILABLE"; AND 3) EACH<br>  VIDEO HAS NO SOUND AT ALL.

5dHKGkz2aa	If your installing the driver the instructions need to be followed just as you pasted on here unless your have an installation disk that came with your video driver. It would tell you step by step. Unfortunately it would be easier if I could do it for you instead of typing you how to. Since I don't own a HP I can't fake it (act like I'm installing) and tell you that way. But I can tell you the HP\DRIVERS\WXP\UPDATE\VIDEO\INTEL are folders in your computer and each one needs to be opened in  that order. Again easier if I could see your computer. But go to your startup button, bottom left corner, and then click on computer, then double click on C: Drive. Your first folder you need to find is HP. It could be there or in your program files double click program files if you don't see it already. But you have to find the HP folder first and when you do then double click it then find the DRIVERS folder which would be in the HP folder then so on and so on, double click the WXP folder, then UPDATE folder, VIDEO folder, and then INTEL folder. In the Intel folder should be a file named setup.exe, double click it then you should just have to follow the steps 2 through 4 that you pasted on here. Hopefully that's what your trying to do and I helped. If you have to mess with the Bios screen I suggest finding professional help, little changes in that can screw things up! I don't mess with that at all unless I know EXACTLY what to do! If this did not answer the question enough you may have to find someone you know that is good at computers and can get on your computer and figure it out or take it somewhere like best buy but be prepared they charge heavily even for easy easy things! Good Luck.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You need to insert the driver disk that came with the machine, or go to the recovery partition, depending which you have, and then do exactly what the installation instruction says.|`|n9JOxJQLaa	go to your start menu on the left side of your screen and click it now click on my computer type in on the top C:HP\DRIVERS\WXP\UPDATE\VIDEO\INTEL then u should see a file that says setup.exe then run it I hope this is right I dont know what Drives it was installed on so I guessed hope it worked

Virus Cleaner is a tool that will remove selected viruses from your computer. While avast! itself is able to detect and delete almost all known viruses, avast! Virus Cleaner can handle only a small selection of the most common ones. The list can be displayed (in the avast! Virus Cleaner tool) by clicking on the "About" button.<br>  <br>  avast!

It repairs the infected files (whenever it is possible) and deletes the virus bodies, so that it is not necessary to reinstall your system or recover it from backups. But it does more! It also removes virus items from the system registry (which is very important in some cases), fixes corrupted configuration files, and deletes temporary files created by the virus (such files do not contain any virus code, so they are not detected by avast! itself - but they occupy space on your hard disk). In short, avast! Virus Cleaner removes every possible trace of the virus from your system. There is no need to perform the cleaning in the Safe Mode - when a virus is found in memory, it is deactivated first.|`|GG7cGJ0Oaa	i dont use avira because i use avast. it runs smoothly in the background, and catches any threat, from surfing bad porn sites, downloading the wrong thing on limewire. <br>  most anti viruses lag the **** out of comps, avast doesnt, and its easy to use. all you gotta do is move to chest, or abort connection

pZwA7Ehyaa	first of all, internet speed should not affect how fast you can open your my documents folder because thats a local folder on your computer.<br>  <br>  to answer your question, there could be more than 1 possibility, here is what I think you need to check:<br>  1) viruses, it's possible your antivirus software isn't updated properly to detect the latest viruses, or that it simply isn't the best antivirus software out there, the #1 antivirus software is bitdefender, you can download it from www.download.com, you get a 30 day trial to scan and fix your pc which should be enough.<br>  2) check for spyware, try super anti-spyware from www.download.com, its free to use<br>  3) it's possible your running out of space, which makes your hardisk fragemented, free some space and run defrag to analyze and defraq your disks, to do that goto my computer double click it, select drive c: or d: and right click on it, then select properties, then open the tools tab, click on defragment now.<br>  4) if none of the above helps, there could be a hardware problem with your computer, have it checked by a support person.|`|Z446YQ10aa	try installing new vista fresh one .reformat your laptop try it. don't forget to backup your files. hope this works good luck|`|QZSLlAaDaa	Well, unless the PC actually caught on fire I don't think the heatwave had anything to do with it (I live in Las Vegas and my PCs never overheat!)<br>  What you might want to do is download "Malware Bytes" spyware scanner and run that. Also, download the trial version of Tuneup Utilities 2009 (it's free for 30 days but if you decide to buy it I highly recommend it) I'd be willing to bet some little nasty got into your machine and is wreaking havoc on it.

AA10251323	Why would you need to delete it immediately, as opposed to simply abandoning it?|`|AA11049365	no...not that i know of|`|AA12286321	why delete it, just stop using it and open a new one. I personally have about 5 emails accounts with different services.|`|142b3b0e7696c477fab5917d8d5ee56caa	Well, you can do what you want: if you want to delete your account, you can do that, but first you maybe would have to save the e-mail addresses of your real contacts (sure you'll need them).  And you don't have to wait any time, just open another one even in the same e-mail provider.<br>  <br>  But, if you want to keep your e-mail address, I recommend some patience and a lot of discipline because you'll have to fight with the "I'll-need-this-eventually" syndrome.  <br>  <br>  Currently, there are many ways to organize the email in the providers, specially by folders.  You have to start this task, ordering your mail by date, name or size (what you prefer!!), and scan it, read it, and decide if you'll keep it or not.<br>  <br>  The main question is: "Would the world collapse if I erase this message?".  If the answer is negative, erase it!!!. If there are some messages with important documents, save the docs, and save the sender or the recipient (maybe you are the sender) in your address book, with a little commentary about the doc or subject of the mail, and erase the message.<br>  <br>  Also, you have to block some senders of spam and junk mail.  If they are strangers to you, don't be afraid to erase their messages.  And if they are from friends or colleagues, take note of that and the next time, send to them a very polite but firm message about your position against spam.  If they are your truly friends, they'll understand.<br>  <br>  Another idea could be having specialized e-mails: one for the family and friends, one for the job, one for the e-shopping, etc.  So, the only thing you would have to do is sending the new address to your contacts.<br>  <br>  In the end, you'll have a very organized, clean and not so big mail account (well, maybe 2 or 3 accounts, but very organized truly :) )<br>  <br>  I hope these ideas will be helpful for you.  Go for it ;)|`|83bce57da9c6e7530da8bc5d55866449aa	You didn't say what your ISP was.

Virus Cleaner is built directly into the avast! Antivirus. If you need, however, it is also possible to download a stand-alone version of the avast! Virus Cleaner from the ALWIL Software web pages - for free. Both the versions (the downloadable one and the one integrated into avast! Antivirus) are the same.<br>  <br>  If avast! detects a virus that is possible to remove using the avast! Virus Cleaner, it will show a special button to start the tool. The button (labeled "Completely remove the virus from the system") will be placed directly in the virus warning window - right above the buttons to delete, rename or move the infected file. When the option to start the avast! Virus Cleaner is available, it is recommended you use it!<br>  <br>  Advantages<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is a tool to completely disinfect your system. It repairs the infected files (whenever it is possible) and deletes the virus bodies, so that it is not necessary to reinstall your system or recover it from backups. But it does more! It also removes virus items from the system registry (which is very important in some cases), fixes corrupted configuration files, and deletes temporary files created by the virus (such files do not contain any virus code, so they are not detected by avast! itself - but they occupy space on your hard disk). In short, avast! Virus Cleaner removes every possible trace of the virus from your system. There is no need to perform the cleaning in the Safe Mode - when a virus is found in memory, it is deactivated first.|`|hgfSJCRAaa	download     avgforfree   great program|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Download, Install & Run<br>  =<br>  AVG Antivirus Software<br>  <a href="http://free.avg.com" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com</a><br>  -<br>  Configure to scan incoming email & attachments.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Word documents can contain active scripting, so it is possible.<br>  Adobe Reader currently has a zero day exploit, with no available fix.<br>  See their website for anticipated fix release dates.

Some people ask for a layer code to cover up something they don't want anyone to see on their page. Usually they want to cover up their last login. You must be able to adjust the width, height, background color, and their position on the screen. But even this won't help if someone comes to your page using a different screen resolution than you are. In this case the layer will not cover up what you want. In fact it will appear somewhere else on the page and cover up something you don't want covered up. In a normal web site you could just make a diffent style sheet for each resolution, You can't do that in a blog.<br>  <br>  ? As you can see it is a good idea to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript even if you don't have a web site of your own. You'll need it just as much on a blog as you would if you had your own web site.|`|09eebf8ef270a5972de65be9f3a9d069aa	go to <a href="http://bbzspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://bbzspace.com</a> and click the bbz Profile Generator.<br>  <br>  here are more:<br>  <a href="http://mygen.com.uk" rel="nofollow">http://mygen.com.uk</a><br>  <a href="http://live.privatepyro.com" rel="nofollow">http://live.privatepyro.com</a><br>  <a href="http://pimpmycom.com" rel="nofollow">http://pimpmycom.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pimpwebpage.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pimpwebpage.com</a><br>  <br>  theres more if u use yahoo search engine.|`|8648d18c8e99157b04d468c8677cd2d9aa	Good question.

ugtMe2YOaa	Norton Antivirus and McAfee Antivirus are two such programs that makes computers extremely slow. <br>  <br>  Since you already have Norton, do a full system scan. It might take 2 or 3 hours, but just give it a try. If any viruses are found, just remove them. If no viruses are found, uninstall Norton and check the speed of your computer. <br>  <br>  If the speed improves, then switch to AVG or Avira Antivirus. <br>  <br>  If still you do not find any improvements, you probably need to do fresh install of your Operating System. Oh..By the way, Dont forget to take a back-up of your data.|`|RjwyRrxtaa	Below can help you speed up your pc:<br>  1. Click Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools – run Disk Cleanup<br>  2. Temporarily close Quick Launch:<br>  Right-click on the Taskbar, click Toolbars, deselect Quick Launch<br>  3. Open My Computer<br>  Right-click on C:<br>  Click Properties<br>  Click Tools, select Error Check (check all and fix), when finished click defrag & run.<br>  4. Click Start, Run ipconfig -renew (type ipconfig space renew)<br>  5. Restart. Right-click on Taskbar, click Toolbars, select Quick Launch to restore<br>  <br>  All these things should be done regularly. The more frequently they are run, the less time they take.<br>  -Note: Games and videos are mostly graphics. Graphics create large files. If these suggestions don't help, you might need more memory.<br>  <br>  Last, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Does a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>   <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|xkh4EAKVaa	i think your antivirus is not updated and your computer is comes in contact with virus by pandrive and dvd's which has virus.and these viruses damaged your system files.you copy the data in dvd's from computer and format te whole computer drives than you used quickheal ativirus for system working safely and properly and more fast.you also update this ativirus in limited time also.<br>  <br>  <br>  panmgh@yahoo.com|`|n9JOxJQLaa	Norton will naturally slow down your alot unless u have a good processor and alot of ram but I would scan your pc first get rid of the virus then delete norton and download AVAST antivirus its free and it scan your pc all day in the background without slowing down your pc at all :)|`|hLQa3VtYaa	Easiest thing to do is back-up all your data on disc then reformat. pop in the windows cd and reformat and your computer will be brand new again... only bad thing is losing all your old files, programs, etc.|`|XxhenzC0aa	if you have norton use your full computer scan.  it might take awhile but totally worth it|`|uQjhGpHxaa	First thing need to do is “clean up” junk files.<br>  <br>  1.

Go to start/programs/accessories/system tools/disk clean up and run it.<br>  This is getting rid of files that will cause the PC to run slow.<br>  3.

Run your spyware and anti virus software<br>  5. Empty Recycle bin<br>  6. Defrag your pc.  Go to Start/program files/accessories/system tools/Disk defrager and run it.  This MAY take hours, so suggest you run while sleeping.<br>  7. Run your spyware and anti virus software<br>  <br>  If you have never cleaned the junk off of your PC, these steps will help it run faster.  One caution however, after you run all these things, it will be very slow, for some reason, the first few tasks you run, but than its good.<br>  <br>  Also, Norton itself is known to slow down PC's-much has been written about it.  So if the above does now get it back to normal, than might consider looking into a less overhead anti virus.<br>  <br>  Refrormatting will speed it up, but, in my opinion, should only be done as a last resort.|`|efmaKbfxaa	Use ESET NOD 32.First of all back up ur data and format ur system.<br>  Then install this anti virus.Don't keep all that themes and other softwares which make the system sloe

1Weszvuoaa	I think the guy above is right but it depends if you are in the UK or america. If you are looking to just get a job out the navy in network infrastructure then it is very difficult in the UK. Most jobs want a mix of programming, networking and tech support. If you have your experience, certification in the above said stuff and know a bit of network programming languages then you might get a job. I have a degree in networking and a CCNA ( Cisco certification ), Network+ plus the old microsoft MCDST, and I couldn't get a job. My friend has two years experience on top of those and he still couldn't get a job in Infrastructure. So ive now switched to Comms engineering. So if you are just looking for pure networking then I would think again. But if your willing to throw in some programming languages then you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Take it from some one with both A degree and certification. Certification is by far the best route. Some places dont care if you have a degree as long as you have your cisco and microsofts.|`|AA11284831	I cut my teeth on computers and networking in the Air Force back in the 1980s and 90s.  I got a support position with IBM when I retired that paid essentially what I was making on Active Duty at the time.  I'm up to $65k per year now in a small Midwest city.  I turned down a couple of offers in the Boston area in the region of $100k due to the cost of living there and not wanting to move.<br>  <br>  In the end, it is what you make of it.<br>  <br>  In the civil sector, I'd recommend the following course of study, in the recommended order:<br>  <br>  A+ certification<br>  <br>  Network+ certification<br>  <br>  Cisco CCNA certification<br>  <br>  Either Microsoft MCSE or Ret Hat RHCE certification.. MS jobs are easier to find, but RH jobs will pay better.  Both certs would be a strong plus if you can afford it
3LHsCLVFaa	Yes|`|71blBLQiaa	The FSB on your mobo will cap the ram to 1333mhz, as long as it supports DDR3 then it will still work but just a little slower than it should. 1333mhz ram is still very fast.|`|2vL8wOHZaa	yes I am afraid you are limited to 1333Mhz.

a080af528147c35140e7fc2b527f52a4aa	Web 2.0 has a greater focus on distributed intelligence than its predecessor (Web 1.0).<br>  <br>  Central to Web 2.0 is the idea of building services (may also be referred to as mash-ups) by pulling things from other sites, blogging and its associated RSS (a syndication technology) whereby you can post something to your site and then you can send it out to subscribers.<br>  <br>  The other main idea of Web 2.0 is that users add value. Sites that harness collective intelligence in some way are examples. eBay, Amazon, Google, all demonstrate that in spades, Yahoo also has directories of user generated content.<br>  <br>  Then you look at sites like Flickr, a photo-sharing service. They've done a tremendous job, first of all of getting all the users to contribute their data, share their data, but also they've syndicated it out to other sites and so you'll see images from Flickr showing up all over the net because they made it really easy using programming web services APIs for people to draw their data out of the site.

If the viewer doesn't see it, that's OK. It's still a powerful logo.<br>  <br>          “The arrow is intended to communicate movement, speed and the dynamic nature of our company,” he said.

XXLOMOjeaa	If you were going to keep the hard drives connected an enclosure would be best. Those allow you to connect a hard drive to a computer by USB. However if you merely want to get the information off them, then as the person before me mentioned a simple IDE to USB cable would do. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend the coolmax one simply because it's the one I use (the vantec one looks like a good one as well. It might come in handy beyond your old hard drives. <br>  <br>  It is very easy to use, you simply plug the adapter into the harddrive where the data cable would normally go. The adapter comes with a power connector, which you need to plug in. Once the harddrive is powered on, plug in the USB cord and flip the power button the adapter. Once your laptop has detected the adapter and hard drive it will show up in My Computer like another hard drive and you can drag and drop like normal. Then turn the adapter's power off, remove hard drive and repeat.|`|KNppmXiXaa	Take a look at IDE to USB adapter cables.  Most will also handle other inputs too.  What this will let you do is connect your old drive to your new computer through a USB port.  The adapter kit includes a data cable and a power cable for the drive.  Note, this is for temporary usage unless you get the kit that includes a drive enclosure.<br>  <br>  Link below is for a data cable version (without the enclosure).<br>  <br>  Another option is to hook the disk up as a slave drive inside your new system.  If the drives from the old system and new system both use the same interface, this is really easy to do.  If the new one uses SATA and the old one uses IDE, you may run into problems.  Some BIOS/motherboards seems to have a problem mixing the two.<br>  <br>  ** Edit **<br>  You can also pick up the cable at a local computer shop for the same price (I found it for less than online actually).|`|AosW4IvHaa	I would be afraid.  Watch what the geeks do and never forget.

c007148f402bec6ea0644b58c6fa4411aa	To my knowledge, there are no such websites that you can go to for uploading a picture of a font and having someone tell you what font it is.<br>  Your best solution, though it may take some searching, is to go to your friends page and view the source of the page.<br>  To do this, once you're at the myspace page click up near the  top of the browser on "View" and down near the bottom of that dropdown menu you should see "Page Source"  Click on that and it should open the source up in another window or a notepad or wordpad page.<br>  Here you will then have to scan through all the html and code until you are able to find the text you're wanting to know the font of.  Somewhere near there, there should be a tag that may look something like <font="***">  and the *** is going to be whatever font name it is.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful somewhat, it may have been easier for me to explain or understand since I know alot about computers and how they work.
Q0VSGg4Maa	Are you taking a course on programming, or graphics?<br>  If it's programming:<br>  I don't have a college to recommend, but I'm going to give you the best advice any REAL programmer can give you.<br>  <br>  Don't even bother with these ridiculous 'video game' college courses;  They are simply cash grabs.  Look, you take post secondary education to give you a chance at getting a good job.  A computer game is only one TYPE of program that you can make.  Do you see any 'word processing' courses which teach you how to make a word processor program, or other program-type specific courses?  No, of course not.<br>  <br>  Learn something like data base or network programming.  You can always form a programming group to build games in your spare time.  The idea here is to get an easy, stable, good paying job.  Not everyone can get lucky and work in-house for a large corporation like EA.  Also, even if you're lucky enough to get a job with a small company who sells their work to large publishers, you don't know how long that job will last.  When you look for a job, you should get information on the companies that interest you...unless you fancy the idea of looking for a new job every 1-3 years.<br>  This applies to ANY job, not just computer-related ones.<br>  <br>  I can write a whole lot of other reasons why these computer game colleges are a load of crap, but I'll just explain one more thing.  If you did some research about programmers who have worked in the field for a long time, you will see that they NEVER went to a computer game college.  Of course, these stupid courses never existed years ago, but a real programmer would have scoffed at the idea of wasting their time and thousands of dollars on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to make games in Windows, here's the plan:<br>  1) Learn C/C++.<br>  2) Get Charles Petzold's book on Programming Windows (Microsoft Press - get it from Amazon) and download the Windows Platform SDK.<br>  3) Once you learn about basic Windows programming, you look in the the SDK API reference guide and look at the other API functions available.<br>  4) Once you get a FIRM handle on programming Windows with the API functions, you can learn to use the DirectX API.  You can buy one or two books on game programming too.  Just don't waste money on one's which teach programming with OOP, .NET, or frameworks.<br>  5) Learn Assembly Language and learn how to write optimized AL code.<br>  You'll see how inefficiently you've been making your high-level language programs when you learn this.  Learning AL will give you the knowledge to write programs (even ones made with C/C++) that aren't a bloated, slow mass of crap like 98-99% of the Windows programs out there today.<br>  <br>  Do this in your spare time and meanwhile, spend most of your time and effort on getting a good, stable job.<br>  There.  If you follow my advice, then you can thank me for saving you several thousands of dollars and a lot of wasted time.  <br>  <br>  You should also learn from people who actually know how to program -a rarity these days.  Idiots who write programs with stupid garbage like OOP, frameworks, interpreted languages, and .NET are NOT programmers.  I really doubt that any of those teachers at those 'game colleges' are anywhere near qualified for just simple Windows programming, let alone resource-heavy game programming.<br>  A REAL programmer can tell the difference between decent code and  bloated, slow garbage code...unlike about 98% of Windows programmers these days.|`|Fh3lH8jgaa	Digipen in Washington state is suppose to be pretty awesome.<br>  <br>  www.digipen.edu
jo9p0jBwaa	well, that would be a virus, my friend. to get rid of it you need to install an antivirus program and run its cleaning feature.|`|1c3M6hyXaa	u are haivng a trojan and spyware along,<br>  use ccleaner to help you alogn with a good antivirus and a anti spyware|`|5dHKGkz2aa	Yes that would be a virus most likely. You should run a virus scanner but update it first before scanning, meaning it should be up to date so that it has a better chance of finding the virus. In some cases the virus can disable the ability of a scanner to detect it making it seem like there is none. Try the link below for a secure and free virus scanner if you don't have one, just click the link below then install the active X control if needed, they'll tell you,(perfectly safe)  and they will scan your whole computer telling you whatever may be wrong. Worst case scenario you may have to restore your computer back to factory settings if virus scanning doesn't help, just make sure you backup all important files, pictures, songs etc. before you do.

Just go to Windows>Dockable Dialogs>Tool Options. This should make your missing Tool Options dialog box appear. To add it back to your tool box, just click at the top of your new dialog box where it shows the name of the active tool (so if you currently have the Paintbrush tool selected, it should say "Paintbrush"), and then drag it to your main tool box where it says "You can drop dockable dialogs here."|`|0uSPPAb5aa	Reinstall and then update .|`|wfU5fUYIaa	try updating it... or uninstall and download the new one

2F5XkiHLaa	Vista has a built-in password reset feature. But you have to plan ahead to use it. When you create the password, make a Password Reset disk. While logged into the Administrator account, click Start>>Control Panel. Click Classic View from the sidebar. Double-click User Accounts.<br>  <br>  Select "Create a password reset disk." This will open the Forgotten Password Wizard. Insert a USB drive. Click Next. Select your USB drive from the dropdown menu. Click Next. Enter your current account password, and click Next. Finally, click Finish.<br>  <br>  Store that USB drive somewhere safe. Dig it out if you forget your password. Try logging into your Administrator account with the wrong password. You'll be notified that the password is incorrect. Click OK.<br>  <br>  A new button labeled "Reset password" appears below the password field. Click it.

1sfHCA0yaa	In the over-crowded hosting market, it can be a daunting task to find a cheap and reliable company to host your website. All the companies promise stable service, but which ones are best for you and your needs? There are several different ways to find hosting that suits your budget but also provides great service. Let me answer your question by showing you what you need to know about finding good web hosting.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is do not buy web hosting based on trust from what you see on the web hosts main page. There is nothing worse than spending all your time and effort building a great web site only to find out that your web host is down all the time or you have to wait an hour on hold just to get customer service on the line to help you fix a simple issue. Visit <a href="http://www.top15hosting.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.top15hosting.com</a> and look through the independent and customer reviews. Look at the rankings of the top rated and do some comparison based on your needs. Do a little research before buying web hosting and you can avoid throwing your money away.

Like everything else you get what you pay for with hosting companies but if you want the tools to properly manage your site and a good customer service team to back you up then I would recommend spending a bit of extra money.<br>  <br>  Bottom line a lot of web hosts are around the same price range, you want to look for one with a respectable name and good customer service.|`|5SoI3DPBaa	these people are pretty cheap and very realiable, they have an uptime guarantee, most hosting providers dont bother with an uptime guarantee.Also these people are very helpful and have nice easy to use tools to help you manage your hosting.

AA10539426	MPEG (pronounced EM-peg) has standardized the following compression formats and ancillary standards:<br>  <br>  MPEG-1: Initial video and audio compression standard. Later used as the standard for Video CD, and includes the popular Layer 3 (MP3) audio compression format.<br>  MPEG-2: Transport, video and audio standards for broadcast-quality television. Used for over-the-air digital television ATSC, DVB and ISDB, digital satellite TV services like Dish Network, digital cable television signals, and (with slight modifications) for DVDs.<br>  MPEG-3: Originally designed for HDTV, but abandoned when it was discovered that MPEG-2 was sufficient for HDTV.<br>  MPEG-4: Expands MPEG-1 to support video/audio "objects," 3D content, low bitrate encoding and support for Digital Rights Management. Several new (newer than MPEG-2 Video) higher efficiency video standards are included (an alternative to MPEG-2 Video), notably, Advanced Simple Profile and Advanced Video Coding. MPEG-4 may be used on HD-DVD and Blu-Ray discs.<br>  MPEG-7: A formal system for describing multimedia content.
2a925e32a9cae0ffdd7fd853a2d333aeaa	Yes mpeg1 is actually mpeg. As for others :<br>  Why MPEG4 SP?<br>  A: MPEG 4 SP (studio profile) is a state of the art algorithm that is universally accepted, and provides visually loss-less recording of full bandwidth images. Using both intra-frame and intra-field compression for progressive and interlace recording, respectively, MPEG 4 SP employs both DCT and DPCM (differential pulse code modulation) compression to ensure the best compression application for each type of recording.<br>  Hehe.

5f0dc05da9b73b28a5764c68b7ca876caa	I've noticed many businesses will use a little home router, without thinking about whether it can keep up with the job.  For a small office, with not much bandwidth, this isn't a problem.  However, it's not realistic to expect a linksys, or any other home office router to reliably keep up with a 1.5Mbps internet connection, and many smaller companies are starting to get that much speed, or more.  <br>  <br>  I once talked to a guy who had extra high speed internet access at home, and had gone through 5 different routers in a year.  He pitched the last one when it started smelling like smoke.  He had quite a nice internet connection, 6Mbps and really used it, so his poor little routers, which were designed for about 1 Mbps were just frying.<br>  <br>  Ask the person who bought the internet connection how fast it is. If it's faster than 1 Mbps (they'll probably say "meg" which is just lots easier to say than mbps) you should consider a different router. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, you can trade up linksys equipment for Cisco Systems equipment, which is far higher quality.  <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/netsol/ns339/ns416/ns437/networking_solutions_packages_list.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/netso...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Joe, I'm responding to Topgun's post.  Feel free to skip this if you're not into linux.<br>  <br>   That article <a href="http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3562391" rel="nofollow">http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/art...</a> was pretty interesting.  I've run into people who've moved the WRT54G to linux before, but mostly it's been techies doing it for fun at home.<br>  <br>  Normally, there are 3 advantages of moving to a Cisco.  1 - The hardware is exceptionally high quality.  This one unfortunately can't be changed by just installing new software, but a linksys does have pretty decent hardware already.  2 - The IOS is designed for extremely high reliabity & fine control - linux is also excellent on both counts.   3 Security- that's an interesting discussion by itself, but to keep it short - with linux, the security's what you make of it, and you can make it pretty darn good.  With Cisco, all the small routers come with excellent security that's easy to set up, on the medium / large ones, it's optional.  <br>  <br>    By the price they're mentioning in the article, I'd assume they're talking about the Cisco 870s, which have a list price of $650.  They could be talking about the 1800s, which are worth $1000 - $3500, but are often sold online at a discount.  <br>  <br>  I'd assume that linksys is going to provide help with their own software, if you switch to something else, it's hard to blame them for not helping you with DD-WRT, they probably just aren't trained on it.|`|499f4d7b27b943aa082cca8540819f45aa	The router should be acting as a gateway- which is not its default setting.

Two features to be wary of though are overclocking the routers processor and increasing  the wi-fi output - DON'T OVERCLOCK - You will burn the processor up - and you shouldn't increase the wi-fi transmit above the value of 40. Of course if you are in the United States it is against the Law to increase the transmit power of this device.<br>  Also, Linksys does not support having their firmware replaced by third party software.

AA10464818	I make 5 digits each month with Adsense (and I'm not talking of the lowest which is $10,000 - I make more than that).<br>  <br>  First off, Google Adsense is NOT for everyone. There are sites that will perform well with Adsense and sites that will not perform with Adsense. Adsense may not be for you if:<br>  <br>  1. Visitors are interested only in your content, and nothing else. <br>  2. Your audience is not researching ways to spend their money. <br>  3. Topic does not pay well. <br>  4. Content type not likely to get “actionable business result.” <br>  5. There are few advertisers in your topic. <br>  6. Poor placement of ads on a page.<br>  <br>  To improve your earnings, look to the above potential problem areas with your Adsense. <br>  <br>  Some topics really will not do well with Adsense -- gaming sites will attract very low CTR and even CPM, but if you have gargantuan traffic, then it might work well. <br>  <br>  Someone came over here at YA a few months ago which runs a charity site; while traffic has grown by leaps and bounds after being featured in the TV show 60 Minutes, they can't still earn more than $10 per month. Because their visitors are not looking at the ads and not looking to spend money other than that charity website (e.g. not looking and researching to buy a camera, looking for a business opportunity, trying to find mortgage) but interested solely in supporting their cause. So even if they have tremendous traffic, it still can't make them enough money.<br>  <br>  If the problem lies with ad placement, check with the Google Heatmap <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=17954" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/adsense/support/b...</a> on the best placement of the ads for your site.|`|20856f4dafc13e1033d7dbc0a21f71bbaa	our website has ten hits a day and has been running for over a year the people who then click onto adsense from our site are negligable -  nowhere near getting any money|`|305f986cb88af463a2004247d0fe42c3aa	its depends, how much time you spend on your site.

44229c4087ce69700bdae78fe0ac22bcaa	Spyware is any software designed to collect user personal information and send it out through a background Internet connection without the user's knowledge and consent. Spyware silently tracks user's web browsing habits, records visited web sites and logs taken actions. This activity allows spyware vendors to gather data for marketing and advertising purposes.<br>  <br>  Spyware form and functionality may vary depending on vendor intentions. However, a particular program that uses an Internet connection to transfer data, which can be used to identify the user, is always classified as spyware.<br>  <br>  Some programs mistakenly called spyware actually do not collect any vital information about the user and use a background Internet channel to transfer general statistics. They do not steal your name, contacts or any other details and therefore do not violate your privacy. Lots of legal advertising applications or ad-supported products such as a legitimate web browser Opera fall into this category. Although legal adware programs potentially are able to spy on a user, they shouldn't be accused of privacy violation, as proper use of adware is a legal revenue model for many software companies that allows to distribute complex commercial products for free.|`|f487f18235ac897bddf905cc87e5b19faa	.|`|9c93bfd6fdcaa2231fe832dc19a35a66aa	read it in wikipedia|`|AA10793857	if i am not wrong, spyware is a program that helps detect possible viruses on your computer. i am not sure if they only warn you or will they attempt to remove the virus (if one is found)|`|AA12137306	It's a nasty program that installs itself when you visit an infected website and most of the times fill your computer with adverts and pop-up windows.

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  2. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  3. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  4. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  5. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  6. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #1 and #2.|`|GyRNktegaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  You could compare some of the best Antivirus software in this site - <a href="http://www.antivirusprice.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antivirusprice.com/</a><br>  <br>  Regards|`|Fovx7sVgaa	u can go with avast<br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/AVG-Anti-Virus-Free-Edition/3000-2239_4-10320142.html?tag=contentBody;mostPopTwoColWrap&cdlPid=11006019" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/AVG-Anti-Virus-F...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a>|`|a5d4060d41b8ba3a058e5b8de42068e2aa	<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/</a> <br>  <br>  pg|`|cFflKJtYaa	i personally use AVG free...just be careful where you go and what you open.|`|c0e4a339249debcc7a5ad2bb1ed6300caa	During the past 12 years I've been using them all...

SkpRC2Nmaa	it just read the tags and look for the most used words usually<br>  <br>  You can look for SEO if you want to know more<br>  <br>  Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the volume and quality of traffic to a web site from search engines via "natural" ("organic" or "algorithmic") search results. Typically, the earlier a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.<br>  <br>  As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work and what people search for. Optimizing a website primarily involves editing its content and HTML coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines.<br>  <br>  The acronym "SEO" can also refer to "search engine optimizers," a term adopted by an industry of consultants who carry out optimization projects on behalf of clients, and by employees who perform SEO services in-house. Search engine optimizers may offer SEO as a stand-alone service or as a part of a broader marketing campaign. Because effective SEO may require changes to the HTML source code of a site, SEO tactics may be incorporated into web site development and design. The term "search engine friendly" may be used to describe web site designs, menus, content management systems and shopping carts that are easy to optimize.<br>  <br>  Another class of techniques, known as black hat SEO or Spamdexing, use methods such as link farms and keyword stuffing that degrade both the relevance of search results and the user-experience of search engines. Search engines look for sites that employ these techniques in order to remove them from their indices.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engi...</a>

Virus Cleaner is a tool that will remove selected viruses from your computer. While avast! itself is able to detect and delete almost all known viruses, avast! Virus Cleaner can handle only a small selection of the most common ones. The list can be displayed (in the avast! Virus Cleaner tool) by clicking on the "About" button.<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is built directly into the avast! Antivirus. If you need, however, it is also possible to download a stand-alone version of the avast! Virus Cleaner from the ALWIL Software web pages - for free. Both the versions (the downloadable one and the one integrated into avast! Antivirus) are the same.<br>  <br>  If avast! detects a virus that is possible to remove using the avast! Virus Cleaner, it will show a special button to start the tool. The button (labeled "Completely remove the virus from the system") will be placed directly in the virus warning window - right above the buttons to delete, rename or move the infected file. When the option to start the avast! Virus Cleaner is available, it is recommended you use it!<br>  <br>  Advantages<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is a tool to completely disinfect your system. It repairs the infected files (whenever it is possible) and deletes the virus bodies, so that it is not necessary to reinstall your system or recover it from backups. But it does more! It also removes virus items from the system registry (which is very important in some cases), fixes corrupted configuration files, and deletes temporary files created by the virus (such files do not contain any virus code, so they are not detected by avast! itself - but they occupy space on your hard disk). In short, avast! Virus Cleaner removes every possible trace of the virus from your system. There is no need to perform the cleaning in the Safe Mode - when a virus is found in memory, it is deactivated first.|`|GxXpvNIwaa	You are infected with spyware if:<br>  <br>  * You see too much pop-up advertisements.<br>  * Your browser has toolbars that you haven't installed.<br>  * Your homepage has changed (and you can't change it back).<br>  * Other settings have changed without your permission.<br>  * Your computer is slow.<br>  <br>  To get rid of spyware and keep your computer clean you can use an antispyware or even more. <br>  You can download a antispyware software.

DjGEJfaPaa	Your machine is infected. Pop-ups are mostly caused by adware, spyware, and other malicious and unwanted software and using pop-up blocker won't help an infected PC. No single program can detect and eradicate all spyware and I recommend using Ad-aware and Spybot (they are free). Other great free anti-spyware programs would be Super anti-spyware and AVG anti-spyware (formally Ewido).<br>  <br>  Running these programs in Safe Mode (tap F8 as the computer boots up and choose to boot to safe mode) can be more effective.<br>  <br>  If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one. Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend using FireFox, it's a far better and safer alternative to Internet Explorer. I also recommend CCleaner which is a free system optimization and privacy tool.|`|kYANUuI8aa	Free - For starters, download, update and run a full scan using SuperAntiSpyware (SAS) <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br>  SAS is an exceptionally easy to use application that will remove the majority of difficult Trojans and Worms, not just the easy ones.  In addition it has the ability to remove Vundo and Smitfraud infections.  SAS can lock your home page to prevent browser hi-jacking attempts.<br>  <br>  If possible it is recommended that you load SAS in normal mode but run it in Safe Mode.  Safe Mode can be started by continually pressing F8 during the boot sequence.  If you are badly infected you might need to run SAS more than once to help clean your system.  Afterwards if the only infections now being shown are in System Restore, once you are completely satisfied that you can boot normally, you can either delete the infected restore points manually, or temporarily turn off System Restore to purge the files. <br>  <br>  Assuming you have some real awkward infections that persist even after trying all the above I suggest you download a dedicated Smitfraud removal program from:<br>  <a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/software/desktop_software/desktop_security/smitfraudfix.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.afterdawn.com/software/deskto...</a><br>  If possible run in Safe Mode.<br>  Likewise the dedicated VundoFix:<br>  <a href="http://vundofix.atribune.org/" rel="nofollow">http://vundofix.atribune.org/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck & safe surfing.<br>  <br>  wdw|`|cSYCHMVZaa	You have spyware/adware on your machine.

2LbTrlQnaa	My best (female) buddy died in October 2000 and she happened to be a Jamaican singing star (known as Jamaica's First Lady Of Songs).  Her family invited me to create a website for her as she had had no significant web presence at the time of her death.  While researching the information that did exist on the web, I found heaps of errors - her date of birth, number of children she had, the name of the talent show on which she got her first break, incorrectly identifying her (more famous) brother as her younger brother when he was in fact her older brother.<br>  The worst thing happened on Wikipedia - totally inadequate article, just a few lines.  Her family edited it to make it a little more substantial but Wikipedia "moderators" deleted it claiming "a second bio is not considered necessary" but it wasn't a second bio, it was more or less a replacement bio.  The original entry (put there by a total stranger) was restored and remains to this day.<br>  Therefore the Internet could be said to be inaccurate - and there are instances of people being able to correct the inaccuracies who are prevented from doing so

Electrical threats also come from the noise of unconditioned power and, in some extreme circumstances, total power loss.<br>  <br>  Environmental: Not only do you need to secure your systems from human interference, but you also need to secure them from the interference of natural disasters such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, and flooding, which fall under the realm of environmental threat. <br>  Environmental issues also come from extreme temperature or humidity.<br>  <br>  Hardware: Hardware threats are simply the threat of physical damage to corporate hardware or its theft.<br>  <br>  Maintenance: Maintenance threats are due to poor handling of electronic components, which cause ESD (electrostatic discharge), the lack of spare parts, poor cabling, poor device labeling, etc.

To change the admin password - connect to your network then open a browser and go to 192.168.1.1 then enter the password and get in.

dkpIjt5jaa	Don't forget about the weakest link that most people tend to forget when building computers, the PSU !<br>  <br>  <br>  For the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  The real lowdown on how much power is needed for PC systems !<br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  <br>  So let's calculate a system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including two (high-end) graphic cards), 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+200(2 X 100)+30+25 = 624<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation as I'm not the one building the machine so compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know what PSU you should get. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 700 Watts and get up to 800 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way).<br>  <br>  Best PSU manufacturers at the moment are brands like Antec, Cooler Master, Corsair and Thermaltake.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: My guide is partly based on this link: <a href="http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/powersuppliesGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power...</a>|`|jmq2i59Jaa	compatibility is becoming an issue again as well as what kind or type of cooling you are going to use an I7 processor for example needs more cooling even the lower setting ones so liquid might be in order where as fans might suffice else where
jHuIwZl8aa	Hi    If it is just a little blurry, use Adobe Photshop or Corel. I am a Magazine editor and we use InDesign, Photoshop or Corel to sharpen our photos.  You can blow up your pics 200%, resample them at 600 dpi, then go in the Blur Tool under effects, and sharpen it gradually. Then shrink them to their original size. The pic should be clear in the end.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Unfortunately, if the picture is blurry, you really cannot sharpen it.

You won't get a picture, but the monitor should probably have indicator lights on it that turn on with power or you can hear it turn on. If there is absolutely no response, and the power cable is securely attached to both the monitor and the electrical outlet, then you have a dead monitor. There's no way to fix it yourself. Since you just bought it, exchange it for a working one.<br>  <br>  If the monitor does turn on, but you just don't get a picture (black screen), then first check the cable between your monitor and computer. Make sure they are connected securely. If your monitor has both VGA and DVI connectors, double-check the auto input to make sure the monitor is receiving the signal from the right connector.<br>  <br>  If that all looks good, try booting up your computer in safe mode (hit F8 when you boot up before Windows starts up). Windows will load in its default setting with the lowest screen resolution. If that comes up, then you know the problem is your Windows display settings. So just change it to a resolution that will work.

The Pro series is also the most expensive of the bunch. Unless you have the same needs as I do, I don't think the Pro is necessary for you.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend going with the Air. Not only is it paper thin, it has a good battery life, and has enough power in it to do everything you'd want. I would also recommend going with Apple no matter what. I used windows for years, and ever since switching over, I've been able to get work done faster and looking better. In fact, the new MacBooks' new batteries last up to 5x longer than most other laptops.|`|KH0RGuVwaa	well i would definately customize it on <a href="http://www.apple.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com</a> <br>  you can read about their laptops their and even customize it for the features you want and need most. I think you should go with just a regular MacBook. You can always purchase certain softwares that you want from Apple. But definately order it from the apple website or an Apple Retail Store because they can help you most, i would not trust Y! Answers alone.|`|6dtAmXcAaa	Go with the macbook pro. It can be used for surfing the web, watching movies, listening to music, downloading whatever, torrenting, and doing whatever you want. They can also be used for much more complicated things and do it faster than the AIR and the regular macbook. Get the AIR if you are not going to be using it for much and just want a mac. Or get the macbook regular if you don't want a heavy duty mac and want a medium mac. <br>  <br>  Get the pro though you will love it in the future. The air doesn't have many usb cables or firewire cables also so that is a down and is why i will never get the air.|`|jO1YCneoaa	The first question you would need to answer is - what do I want to use it for?  I noticed a couple of things in your question - but the big questions is do you need to use video editing or heavy graphics?  If so, then a MAC or Apple is by far the best.  But it is much more expensive than a Windows based.  If you just need it for email, watching movies, listening to music - not real heavy stuff, then a Windows based laptop is great.  Just make sure that you get the maximum amount of RAM (usually 4GB) and a large hard drive if you are going to store movies on it.|`|RhpqDA9Kaa	air
5mqWIRPuaa	Dunno.  Somebody at your school should be able to tell you.
4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	your taking it off wrong.    my brothers ipod would always need repairing with itunes when he did that.    once you connect it, dont disconnect it untill you    1 go to (my) computer,     2 right click on the ipod,    3 and select eject. then the screen will change on the ipod and it's safe to disconnect.
jHuIwZl8aa	Hi    Go in control panetl and click on Printer. OPen the folder and double-click on your printer icon. Their might be old jobs in there. Just select them and delete the jobs in the queue.    If you have no job in the print queue, then upgrade your printer drivers. That is the only think I can see.
AA11434633	You need Vista drivers for your printers.    You'll need to go to the individual manufacturer's sites and check in Support/Downloads and check whether there are actually Vista drivers available.    Unfortunately, not all printers do have Vista drivers.  Some manufacturer's expect you to upgrade to a more modern printer ... preferably one of their own.

b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	It's a compatibility issue with the drive & the particular media ..... I've seen it happen many times.    Best you can do is go to the drive mfg site & look for a firmware upgrade to enhance compatibility with certain media types.    regards,  Philip T|`|XVpq4tOQaa	You burned at a different speed, one time 2x probably 4x or 8x other time...there really is no difference anymore. It used to be that only one would be able to play on DVD players when people burned movies but now doesn't matter, like CD+r and CD-r
