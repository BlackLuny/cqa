I'm a freshman in high school and we're applying for our 10th grade courses and I'm torn between continuing playing in band or dropping the class. In college, I'm thinking of majoring in a science or english area and I want to know how it will look on my transcript that I dropped band if I choose to do so. All the guidance counselors keep on telling us that colleges like to see that we continued in band throughout high school because they like to see that commitment but will it matter if I'm not majoring in music? Also, dropping band lets me take the med/tech elective I really want to take.

I put Midwood as my first choice, and Murrow as my second. Is there a definite chance that I will get into Midwood or Murrow?

20060909054723AAno3pB	Education & Reference;Teaching	E' giusto insegnare religione cattolica nelle scuole? Ed è giusto che a farlo molte volte ci siano i preti?	Insomma non siamo più nel medioevo...l'Italia si dichiara un paese laico, me nella realtà non lo è. Siamo nel 2006 e la società diventa sempre più variegata, i cattolici sono la stragrande maggioranza, ma non la totalità. In uno stato laico, nei luoghi pubblici, le persone vanno trattate nello stesso modo e senza discriminazioni. Bè secondo me insegnando religione cattolica si discrimina un po' chi cattolico non lo è. E poi, chi vuole scoprire Dio o chi vuole che il proprio figlio diventi un buon cattolico lo manda in Chiesa.   Dato che le religioni sevono per capire anche la società di oggi io farei più che altro qualcosa tipo "storia delle religioni", in modo da avere una conoscenza di tutte le religioni, non solo quella cattolica. E poi i preti che insegnano nelle scuole sono una cosa sbagliatissima perchè non potranno mai chiarire nulla perchè non sono obiettivi (parlo x esperienza personale).   E' vero che si può fare l'esonero, ma io lo trovo sbagliato lo stesso.   Cosa ne pensate?

I want to study abroad next year (full year) in Germany. But, I have an amazing boyfriend here, in the US, that I love very much. He is 9 years older than me - I'm 19 and he is 28. When he was in school, he had the chance to study abroad. But now that I have the chance to go, I'm thinking I shouldn't. I love this man so much, and would be crazy to leave him for a whole year. I could honestly see myself marrying him, and he has said that if we are still together this time next year, he wants to get engaged.       I guess I'm just not sure if I should throw everything I have with him to the wind, and just follow my dreams to study abroad. In all honesty, I am very excited about the possibility of studying abroad, but it makes me cry to think about leaving my boyfriend. I feel like he got the chance to do things like this when he was younger, and now it is my turn, but I'm just not sure if I should go or not. I would miss him, he is the love of my life. I'm not sure it is a good idea to put my relationship at risk just to follow my dreams.      HELP, opinions please!
