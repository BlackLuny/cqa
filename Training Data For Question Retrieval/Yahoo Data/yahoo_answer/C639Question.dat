20090203132842AAGkKpW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you stop loving or wanting someone?...?	My ex-fiance broke up with me two days after Christmas.  I still love her, but she doesn't love me in that way anymore.      We are still close and we need to be because we have kids together.  She still lives with me, because I want to know she is safe.      I am in no "financial" position to seek out another person I could love, or would love me back.  Not to mention I get horny as hell, and every time I can't have her, I get stressed like hell.      Now there is another guy in the picture that she has said she has feelings for, which I don't believe is as true feelings as she thinks.  Not to mention I know this type of guy to be dangerous, they aren't dating or anything, but I can't stop her from falling for him.      I want to know she is safe, but everyday I see her I feel even more rejection and heartache.  But since I don't have cash to spare, I can't even take a girl out just to have fun, or anything and it is driving me nuts.  She is the only one I have for any compassion or sex, but being without her, without anyone else in my life, still feels worse than just taking what I can get from her.      Any suggestions!?

20090203132800AAxtKkg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, would you feel weird going out with a guy that had smaller feet than you?	I'm a uk 6 (7us mens) so not not really small and 5'8'', and find that some girls have bigger feet than me. My girlfriend of the last few months is two sizes bigger and last week when we went bowling with her younger sister and her bf, her sister was amazed when i ordered size 6. She is a 7, my gf is 8, and she said it was really weird and that she wouldn't like that (her bf being a 12!). My gf just said something like 'he only has baby feet'.      I know it won't end a strong relationship but is it weird for a girl? And are my feet really that small.
20090203132839AA5lR9q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Other than procreations and "fun" does sex serve any other purpose?	My wife states that she only has sex for fun. I believe that sex serves a bigger purpose than fun alone. It offers a chance for connection through intimacy and to show your love. However their are times its all about fun. But if it were only about fun then why only have sex with your spouse? Why not have sex with anybody so long is its only about fun? I do not agree with those sentiments but I would like to here others opinions.

I've known this guy for two years. He's a friend of my best friends brother... any way we talk ocassioanlly and mostly its just me starting the conversations. He does look sorta interested. And at Christmas the day before we got out for christmas break I got him (along with all my other friends) a small but very nice gift. He sort of took a step forward like he wanted to hug me.... and there have been other times where people will make comments to me like "Who are you taking to Prom (nameless)... (my name)?" or others will come up to me after school when (nameless) is standing near and say: "(nameless) wants to take you home." and he'll say "I never said that."... I'm so lost. And I think my best friend told her brother and he probably told him. btw i'm a sophomore and he's a senior. There's a two year difference between us age wise.

How can you have a relationship or date without friendship you know?    P.S.- you don't have to answer this question but:    Do you think I'm ugly, avrage (which means not ugly or cute) or hot/cute?    I'm only asking because I'm taking a survey from girls in school.     Her:    i guess ur cute  is this a survey 2 boost ur confidence?     Me    Not necessarily to boost my confidence. I sent out 2 online survey s and got 39 answers. I just wanted to know what you though of me because...    P.S. Just guess at what the end of the last sentence would say. If not right I'll tell you.    Her:    kick me if i'm wrong but is bc u have a crush on me?     Me:    If I say yes what would you do or say?     Me:    Because I do have a crush on you, but not so much a crush now that it's not secret anymore but you get the point.  Her:    i'd say ur pretty lucky since i've been eyeing u 2     me:  Wait so what does that mean?     If it's an obvious thing I'm just gonna say that I really don't know signs when it comes to girls, not even the obvious ones.    My question is what do i do next ask her out or what?

20090203133044AAUMokW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: When do you start thinking about marriage?	This is kind of hard to explain, but my boyfriend and I are both 23 years old, going out for 8 months. He is an accountant and I am in graduate school. Do you think at this point in his life he is taking our relationship more seriously then he did to others before he was out of school and in the working world?       I'm not asking if you think he may be thinking about proposing, but do you think he takes our relationship more seriously, and that he might wonder if I am in the one who he would spend the rest of his life with?      When do guys usually start thinking about marriage or when do you start to think about if your girlfriend is the one? Does it scare you? Or do you just think youre girlfriend is just another girlfriend added to your list and you'll probably marry someone else?

My girlfriend and I have been talking about having a baby for the past month or so now and we both were very excited.  Then in the past couple days she's been talking about how she can't have a baby because my family would hate her.  I will admit my family are not her biggest fans but I've always told her that I love her and I don't care what they think.  Today we were texting back and forth and talking about how we are both excited about having a baby and how we're gonna try for one valentines weekend.  We've had this thing where when we say I love you we'll add mommy or daddy to the end of it like it was our kid saying it.  I said I love you mommy and then she said that if I say that too her again she'll start crying and I asked why.  She said my family would hate her.  I told her I don't care what they think again and then she said she's never having a baby.  Now she won't text me back and she won't answer my phone calls.  I really need some advice here.  Can anyone help me?

20090203133505AAS8tDy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i get in his car?	I met this guy a few weeks ago and he's pretty cool. He's a bit protective of me and he's so sweet, always holding my hand and carrying me around. I really like him, and he told me he likes me, but i have one problem which is the age difference. He's nineteen and i'm only thirteen... which makes me feel like such a baby. I'm surprised that he's okay with the six year gap, most nineteen year old guys wouldn't give me the time of day and i know you probably think he's a pervert and that he's using me, but he's really not that type of guy. He's never tried forcing me into anything, or anything like that. He's genuinely nice.   Anyway, he drives and he's offered to take me for a ride sometime, we don't even have to be alone. He's a really good driver, but he drives fast and dangerously on country roads at night. I'm up for it, sounds exciting and i'd probably be the first to make a move, incase you're thinking he wants to take advantage of me in his car or something. He's a good guy. I was just wondering if you have any advice or past experiences you'd wanna share with me before i make any wrong decicisions? Thanks in advance : )      x x x

20090203133628AAYDeQY	Family & Relationships;Family	A Tremendous Problem -- Advice Please?	I am 21 years old and am looking forward to beginning my life and raising a family with my fiance. I have followed in my grandfather's footsteps and am a Christian. To set the groundwork for the problem, I feel that I'm a good person and have worked to make myself a good Christian.    My problem is my father. On top of simply being hateful and selfish, he has a string of terrible choices behind him. He has conspired to rape and murder. He smoked weed and is a sex addict. He has admitted to being thankful for not having a daughter lest he be tempted to molest her. He slept around on my mother, who deserved such a thing least of anyone I know, for thirteen years with over fifty women, by his own account, some of them thirteen and younger. He married a fifteen year old and attempted to "cruelly" ditch her when he got tired of her. He is ridiculously judgmental and slanderous, riding on the backs of other's failures to makes his lesser or invisible.    My problem is that I don't want my future family influenced by him. Obviously, by the small portion of his problems that I stated above, it's grounds to keep them away. However, the real problem is that he is a likable person. I hear that many people like that are likable in the interest of covering up their true self. That seems to fit him. He's witty, smart, affectionate, and is respected by those who don't know better.    If I leave him, I lose my family; aunts, uncles, grandparents, my brother... they already believe the slander and lies he has told them against me, but to leave would be to seal the deal.

20080719181504AAF4Age	Family & Relationships;Friends	? No crees que esto esconde una AUTENTICA VERDAD???????	Todo mi patrimonio son mis amigos" Emily Dickinson.          Un verdadero amigo es aquel que entra cuando todos los demás se van.          Un amigo es alguien que está contigo porque le necesitas, aunque le encantaría estar en otra parte.          Cuando te duele mirar hacia atrás y te da miedo mirar adelante, mira hacia la izquierda o la derecha y allí estaré, a tu lado.          Mucha gente entra en y sale de su vida a lo largo de los a?os. Pero solo los verdaderos amigos dejan huellas en su corazón.          Un amigo verdadero es alguien que cree en ti aunque tu hayas dejado de creer en ti mismo.          Un abrazo vale mil palabras. Un amigo más.          Al final, no nos acordaremos tanto de las palabras de nuestros enemigos, sino de los silencios de nuestros amigos (Martin Luther King, Jr.)          Cultivar un verdadero amigo requiere dedicación y tiempo.          La amistad es el ingrediente más importante en la receta de la vida.          Una vida sin amigos es como vivir en una isla desierta, sin agua, sin alim
20080718163345AAzK6J4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Me permiten dedicarles algo?????????????	A mis amigos      A mis amigos les adeudo la ternura   Y las palabras de aliento y el abrazo;   El compartir con todos ellos la factura   Que nos presenta la vida, paso a paso.      A mis amigos les adeudo la paciencia   De tolerarme las espinas mas agudas;   Los arrebatos de humor, la negligencia,   Las vanidades, los temores y las dudas.      Un barco fragil de papel,   Parece a veces la amistad   Pero jamas puede con el   La mas violenta tempestad   Porque ese barco de papel,   Tiene aferrado a su timon   Por capitan y timonel:   Un corazon.      A mis amigos les adeudo algun enfado   Que perturbara sin querer nuestra armonia;   Sabemos todos que no puede ser pecado   El discutir, alguna vez, por tonterias.      A mis amigos legare cuando me muera   Mi devocion en un acorde de guitarra   Y entre los versos olvidados de un poema,   Mi pobre alma incorregible de cigarra.      Un barco fragil de papel,   Parece a veces la amistad   Pero jamas puede con el   La mas violenta tempestad   Porque ese barco de papel,   Tiene aferrado a su timon   Por capitan y timonel:   Un corazon.      Amigo mio si esta copla como el viento,   Adonde quieras escucharla te reclama,   Seras plural, porque lo exige el sentimiento   Cuando se lleva a los amigos en el alma.

Pongan que tienen un trabajo absorvente de lunes a sabado y ademas estan separados hace dos a?os de su ex-pareja y tienen un hijo de 5 a?os al que adoran y van a verle 3 veces a la semana: martes, jueves y sabado por las tardes. Los lunes, miercoles y viernes se quedan en el trabajo hasta tarde.      Ademas de eso tienen una nueva pareja, la que por su tiempo solo pueden ver los martes, viernes en la noche, digamos de 10:30 a 11:30pm, y los domingos toda la tarde.      Pues resulta que no tienes tiempo de ver a los amigos que deseas y debido al tiempo tambien ellos solo pueden verte los domingos en la tarde. Pero tu pareja actual no disfruta tanto de tus amigos como tu y prefiere estar contigo la mayor tiempo a solas contigo. PERO TU TAMBIEN QUIERES VER A TUS AMIGOS!!!      Si le dices a tu pareja para verse algunas veces los domingos en la ma?ana se enoja diciendo que eres un egoista y que el fin de semana deberias dedicarselo unicamente puesto que no se ven mucho durante la semana.

All i can remember for sure is that the girl that i like asked me if i did during the party and i denied it. So this was some time ago, a month ago, and i thought it was done and buried but today my friend asked me if i hooked up with anyone that night. I said u dun remember and he said he heard a rumour i hooked up with that girl.

20090203135412AAmpHtL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I recently found out my wife is into bestiality(sex with animals)...how do I deal with this?	I know it sounds crazy, but this woman is my soul-mate.  We've been together for 5 years.  Each year was heaven.  We live next to a ranch where there are horses.  We have ridden horses together for the last three years.  Anyway, she goes out sometimes to 'tend' to the horses.  We befriended the lady that owns the horses, as you may have already guessed, and she hangs out with the lady some evenings and helps her with the horses.  Well, one night while she was out I had an emergency at home(our daughter was very sick), so I put our daughter in the car and drove to the ranch.  After knocking and yelling and getting no response, I went around back where the stable is and I here commotion and moaning.  I go in the direction of the sounds and there before my eyes was my wife with a pony.  I refuse to go into detail.  I won't bother with what happened next.  We are separated and I'm considering going back because I love her.  She has promised to go to counseling.  What should I do?
20090410184704AAg3Hyz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do teens bother to have boyfriends/girlfriends?	I asked a question earlier about me and this guy about to be boyfriend and girlfriend. And people started answering, "You're really young" and "as if it's going anywhere, you're freakin' 16" and it pissed me off cause kids that are 12 who are in relationships get better answers then that! But then, yeah, I'm not the most romantic person in the world, and I'm not into that boyfriend/girlfriend stuff, so with that guy, I'm thinking now "what the hell am I doing? this isn't me" I was just wondering, Why do teens (13-17 years old) bother to be in relationships that would probably end before graduation, are ruled by hormones, and would end up being painful and a waste of time in the end?

20090203051701AAkbY1t	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Have you had dreams about your perfect wedding? how's it like? or have u had one?	I know it's probably still ages to come or maybe you're already a bride/groom.   But you must have dream about your PERFECT WEDDING before,right?    if not then this is the time to think about that, come share it with the others..      my perfect dream wedding will be in a grand ballroom, very elegant and exquisite,everything white and pinkish also litle bit of gold cream colour,lots and lots and lotsssss of rROSES,chandeliers and candles with live jazz and romantic piano songs.       OKAY this is the unique part. I want this wedding to be a SURPRISE for my hubby!    so instead of us planning together, i'll just plan the wedding myself,of course i will ask him about the decor but just so randomly from time to time, so he won't get suspicious.      there are lots of other details in my head!      Now ur turn...*cheers* for happily ever after.... ^ _ ^
20090203135424AA3Q6rj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex is trying to make me feel bad? ?	I just broke up with my boyfriend a few days ago... I feel bad about it but i know it wasn't meant to be and I wasn't happy with the relationship. I told him as gently as i could I just wanted to be friends and our relationship wasn't going to be possible at this time. He was happy until today and he asked me if i still loved him. I didn't want to lie so i said i love him as a friend and he became very sad and angry with me, more depressed then hateful.       He keeps sending me texts and his siblings are now sending me messages. His siblings are just being plain harassing and theyre being quite rude, and he is acting almost... emo. I don't want to go back with him because I don't like him any more and I really do want to be friends, just not boyfriend and girlfriend. We are only young and he keeps texting me on the computer and phone and he said he wanted to spend his life with me and stuff, and to me its getting really awkward because he follows me everywhere acting sad and he even like blocked me in the hallway today and wouldn't let me go by and he started to laugh because he thought it was funny. He called me 6 times the first day, 7 times yesterday, and he won't even talk to me today because hes so depressed.      What should I do? I know going back would be the worst thing for both of us... It would hurt him later on if the relationship ended and I'm not happy at all. What do I do to make the both of us happy?      Also... I want a boy who likes to listen to music, draw even if he isnt good at it at all, and be very nice to me and put me before any other woman. (I'm going to become a guitar teacher). I'm going to a music college with a lot of performers and such attending, so I don't think it will be that hard to find someone... His sibling told me that I wasn't putting in any effort and that opposites attract so we should still be together... What do I do to get everyone off my back? And do you think my standards are way too high? =( I know most of you will think yes.
20090203135325AA1kR9l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How am i meant to end it if he wont talk to me?	i am sort of seeing someone but i know it is never going to go anywhere even though he has told me he loves me.... so i want end it before we fall out but he wont talk to me.
20080713100803AAnIjzn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	? Disfrutas tu cafe.........???	Un grupo de profesionales, todos triunfadores en sus respectivas carreras, se juntó para visitar a su antiguo profesor. Pronto la charla   devino en quejas acerca del interminable 'stress' que les producía el trabajo y la vida en general. El profesor les ofreció café, fue a la   cocina y pronto regresó con una cafetera grande y una selección de tazas de lo más ecléctica: de porcelana, plástico, vidrio, cristal, unas   sencillas y baratas, otras decoradas, unas caras, otras realmente exquisitas... Tranquilamente les dijo que escogieran una taza y se   sirvieran un poco del café recién preparado. Cuando lo hubieron hecho, el viejo maestro se aclaró la garganta y con mucha calma y paciencia se dirigió al grupo: 'Se habrán dado cuenta de que todas las tazas que lucían bonitas se terminaron primero y quedaron pocas de las más sencillas y baratas; lo que es natural, ya que cada quien prefiere lo mejor para sí mismo. ésa es realmente la causa de muchos de sus problemas relativos al 'stress.' Continuó: 'Les aseguro que la taza no le a?adió calidad al café. En verdad la taza solamente disfraza o reviste lo que bebemos.   Lo que ustedes querían era el café, no la taza, pero instintivamente buscaron las mejores. Después se pusieron a mirar las tazas de los   demás. Ahora piensen en esto: La vida es el café. Los trabajos, el dinero, la posición social, etc. son meras tazas, que le dan forma y   soporte a la vida y el tipo de taza que tengamos no define ni cambia realmente la calidad de vida que llevemos. A menudo, por concentrarnos sólo en la taza dejamos de disfrutar el café. ?Disfruten su café! La gente más feliz no es la que tiene lo mejor de todo sino la que hace lo mejor con lo que tiene; así pues, recuérdenlo

We have been together for over two years.I have a high sex drive (twice a day minimum type) and he's totally not interested in sex. We have a great relationship though, we're best friends, I trust him more than I trust anyone. But not having sex is extremely frustrating for me and its hurtful. I have tried talking to him about it but nothing has ever been resolved( he just makes excuses). So do I stay in the relationship because everything else is great and just deal with the fact I'll be masturbating for the rest of my life or do I end it and hope we can still be friends?

Hi, I have a problem, I just got married a few months ago and finally received all the paperwork from my spouse who is now waiting in India for me to sponsor her.  We had our marriage ceremony done in New Delhi, but afterwards went to her home in Jalandhar, when tey made our marriage certificate they show our place of marriage is in Jalandhar when in fact it should be New Delhi.  I am now back home here in Canada and she says the court will not correct the mistake by no means because of red tape.  I will not be able to return to India for a long while now.  Is it possible to go around this error through means of an affidavit explaining and then attaching to the marriage certificate itself?  thank you.

Anytime I ask this, I always get the same response, "because I love you." Normally I just shrug and let it go, but not this time. I was really curious, because for Valentine's Day I gave him a giant card and in it I wrote down 150 reasons why I love him. When I finally got him to give me a response, all he could think of was, "I love the way you treat me."      So, he loves the way I treat him, but he doesn't love me? Am I crazy here or is he just blinded by the way I spoil him. Does he really love me? Is this just a guy thing where they don't like to be asked these kinds of questions? We're very happy together and we're even trying for our first baby, but what do you think? Opinions please, should I be worried about this? How would you feel if your husband said that to you?

20081028084041AAzghrY	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I have bothered with a white dress?	To start off - I'm talking about HISTORICAL meanings here. If you want to re-define what a white dress means, that's your call, but don't act as if I've done so.       And now the background: I decided against wearing my mom's dress (I'm too big through the waist to wear it, so it was cheaper to just buy a new one, I know that it's a horrible thing to do, but it was a decision made under stress). The dress is ivory (close enough to white), but I'm already looking for occasions when I can wear it again, or failing that, a way to alter it so I can have more occasions where I can wear it. The wedding, by the way, isn't for another 7 months.       Given that I'm going so completely against the purpose of wearing a white dress at the wedding, should I just have worn something other than white? Or does no one care about the meaning of a white dress anymore?

20080926072749AAiaW2T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think about my 6 year olds comment?	Background:  I'm divorced, it's been almost 4 years now, I responsibily always speak nicely/respectfully/kindly about my son's father in front of my son, albeit my ex has alot of animosity towards me. My son is very intuitive, so I watch my words, tone, facial expressions, everything when it comes to speaking of his father.      While waiting for the bus as the bus stop this a.m. I noticed that my son had buttoned his shirt wrong so I had to unbutton/re-button - and did so playfully, with the other Mom's and kids watching/overhearing.  As he mocked being embarrassed/aggravated I jokingly commented 'Uh Oh  - I think Nick is going to kill me!' and he responded clear as day for all to hear: "I think my Dad would rather."      What do you think of his comment.

Una de las veces él estaba con ella y le pedi q la calmara pq me hablaba cada rato pq esa vez yo marq me cance de esconderme, y contesto el, el caso es q el hizo como q no escucho y colgo.

No quiero cambiar mi num. porq ya tengo tiempo con el... porfavor dame un consejo.    P.D 1. PENSE HABLARLE A éL PARA Q YA CALME A SU BESTIA JEJE! PERO NO ME ATREVO, PQ YA NO KIERO SABER NADA DE EL, Y ENFRENTARME A ELLA ES DARLE PIE A Q ME DIGA COSAS Q ME HIERAN O ME LASTIMEN, Y YO YA KIERO CERRAR ESE CIRCULO, FRANCAMENTE AUN ME DA NOSTALGIA SABER Q EL ME ENGA?O...

Dilema sobre regalo de navidad para mi hija menor 5  de anos?	ella tiene tres anos que le encarga ha santa un Violín, y pues santa no había encontrado uno de juguete , así que siempre le trae otra cosa. este ano Santa ya tiene su regalo y otra vez no es un Violín, Santa le compro un dvd portátil , para cuando viajamos se entretengan viendo una película . hoy le dije que santa me había hablado por teléfono y me dijo que si de verdad era tan importante el Violín para ella , y ella me dijo si , que entre el dvd y el Violín ella quiere el violín o ir al Taller de Santa y ella escoger su regalo .    Yo ya encontré un Violín , pero cuesta 125 DLS . y ya compre el dvd. Su Papa todavía no compra nada , seria buena idea decirle al Papa que el le regale el dvd , que me de lo que quiera de $ y yo comprar el Violín , o regresar el Dvd ( que a la que beneficia es ami cuando voy manejando ) y con ese dinero comprar el Violín , o dejarla otra navidad sin Violín , por que no encuentro mas baratos o de juguete , de hecho ella dice que no quiere uno de mentiras quiere uno de verdad, TENDRE UN VIOLINISTA EN POTENCIA Y ME RESISTO A ACEPTARLO.

20090222160212AApYTtc	Family & Relationships;Friends	What will you guys do in this situation?	This guy that I been close friends with has pissed me off today. What made me mad was that every time he brings this female friend to church and he starts to act funny when he sees me. He act like he can't speak or acknowledge me, and act like he's in a hurry to leave so i won't say anything to him. Any other time, he acts like he likes me so much and wants me to meet with him. This is like the 2nd or 3rd time he acted like this to me. She's not his girlfriend, neither am I, so I really don't understand his attitude. After church was over, I text him saying that he doesn't have to act like that when this girl comes to church. I don't know whether I should be mad about it, or just act like I don't care. I would like to know how would you guys react to this type of situation?

Said she was fed up in general but I think it was because the guys she was flirting with began to realise she was just using them to line her pockets filling her car up at the garage, paying for her weekly shopping as well as the usual nights out and all that. She's the kind that looks down on everyone, goes to church of a weekend and then slates everyone off. Butter wouldn't melt. She actually went away because she was pregnant. I saw her the over the weekend talking to a woman over coffee. She didn't notice me although I was actually serving at the coffee shop she came to. The baby looked about a year old. Thing is, I know both the guys she was going with at the time, one is in another relationship with a friend of mine, the other really took the split to heart and has never got involved with anyone else. Should I let on to either of them about the baby, or should I make myself seen next time she comes in the mall so she knows I know her secret?

I never called my wife anything, but nowher lover is very hurt and angry at me, her mother said I am not welcome at her house any longer, and her mother told me that my wifes brother is going to come down and kick my ***.      How do I make ammends after saying such a thing?  Also, was my wife right in telling her lover that would hurt so deeply?  Finally, how do you deal with your wife having a lesbian lover that is half her age?

20090222105459AAY2g7a	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does it hurt your feelings when your friends and family forget your birthday?	Generally my friends invite me out for birthday night but this year everyone shoved me out of the picture. One friend went to see a great band and told me all about it rather than inviting me. My other friends just avoided me - no invitations or pop-in birthday visits that I thought may be coming.    Then I called my dad to chat and he remembered at the last minute what the day was.     My husband actually forgot my birthday all together.       My question is, am I justified in feeling hurt and a little angry at the people in my life?

20090222124738AAe70ve	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Going thru a divorce after 7 months of marriage... What am I entitled to?	Unfortunatly, me and my husband are going thru a divorce after only being married 7 months. This is his 3 rd marriage and he's only 30, he has to kids and he doesnt own up to any financial responisbilites that he "agreed on" at the settlement. His past divorces, they settled "the nice way" and just agreed to terms. I know, he never has followed up on anything. So, here I am.... He lived here in MY house that I own, all the bills, all the late payments, late mortgage and everything!! He's left me high and dry in a financial state that I have NEVER been in. Question: He left the house, leaving me with all the bills. Is he still entitled to pay the mortgage, bills and everything else since we are still married? Or is he just allowed to just walk away like some girl he was just dating? Im getting a lawyer, because I just dont think its fair. Please advise me on anything... thanks ;)
20090222124752AAKnVOt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if you're the husband?	My friend and I got into a fight--both equally responsible for what happened.      The fight died down for a while until something started again that got both of us riled up. This time, her husband got involved. They both made a call to me at 11 PM. Started yelling and calling me names. Husband was very nasty. When he was calling me name, I handed my phone to my husband. He heard everything.      My husband asked what's going on. I told him that it's about the fight that my friend and I had, but this time, the husband is getting involved. Her husband was VERY nasty on the phone and even call my husband names.      My husband is not the type to act like this. He is very calm and does not get riled up. Eventhough most people would have gone through the roof!      He talked to my friend's husband on the phone and got him to calm down. Then he explained how his behavior was juvenile and he should apologize. My friend's husband apoligized to MY husband but not to me. Keep in mind I also got called all kinds of names. My husband is working on trying to get him to apologize to me now.       My problem is..my husband is just handling this whole situation like it's a walk in the park. The three of us are screaming at each other on the phone, yelling and what not. My husband remains calm. This is frustrating because I feel like our friends are being vicious and shouldn't my husband be atleast a little bit upset about this? He is upset but extemely cool. He said he wants to keep his cool because he was a good friend (my friend's husband) and my husband did not expect that he would join in the girls fight.      Is my husband trying to keep the moral high ground or he just doesn't care? I am a little hurt by this that he's not meeting this whole thing head on! If my friend's husband was being so vicious--I feel like my husband should be atleast half as agressive. But he's not. It's frustrating. He tells me that his friend ( my ex friend's husband) is only acting that way because he's been manipulated by his wife (my ex friend) into joining a fight and into tearing me down. Be that as it may..I sometimes wish my husband would go over there and just kick the guy's ***!

There's this girl I used to be best friends with, but I stopped talking to her cause I think she's a *****. She's always talking crap about me to my boyfriend, and it gets me annoyed that she's talking badly about me to MY boyfriend. I told him how frustrated it makes me to know that they talk, and he gave me advice saying "Oh, just lose all contact with her. Block her, don't talk to her."   So today is my birthday, and I get a phone call from her, so I was wondered what she wanted, and I picked up. I figured she was just trying to be nice and wish me a happy birthday, ok, it's not like I'm having a conversation with her, no big deal. Which she did, all she said was "Happy birthday." So I thanked her and hung up.      She just told my boyfriend "I spoke to her on the phone, she sounded like a man." Now my boyfriends pissed at me because I ignored his advice, and enabled her to contact me. He was like "Wtf, does my advice go through one ear and out the other? I care so much, that I don't want you to have any problems, big or small, cause small things can build up, so what's the point of me wasting my breath trying to help you, if you're just gonna ignore what I tell you? Whatever, you want me to care less? Fine, wish granted. I'm not gonna offer you advice unless you desperatley need it."      He's also upset because he's already really mad about work, and this situation is just making it worse.      Wtf, what should I say/do?

He has even hit me before...but it seems he is the only one I love soo much...and when i am with him...i dont understand why. He makes fun of me and he has a very short fuse, last night i apologized for being so lovely with him and he responded back saying how much he loves it and blah, blah,blah...then he called me and i was next to the room where my parents were asleep so i started to talk low, he starts accusing me out of no where and doesnt understand why i am talking so low, i then called him from my house to prove to him that i was indeed saying the truth which i have never given him any reason whatsoever to not trust me..then he says look i dont even want to deal with this, you sound so fishy...and hung up on me...now let me add that he almost always more that twice a day at least hangs up on me...and then when i ask why he even wastes his words saying he loves me he just says sorry and blows off the subject...how can he say he loves me and promise to not hang up on me anymore and then do it? I know i cant expect a perfect guy..but he is my first serious bf whom i lost it too and i have not been with anyone else...so i dont know how it should be...we have been together 5yrs, i am 22 and he is 23...any advice from people with experience would be great...thanks so much!! i dont mind honesty

Okay so, my boyfriend's birthday is coming up and he and his dad are going to Columbus to see a couple NHL games. My boyfriend is OBSESSED with hockey and LOVES the Blue Jackets so I thought since he's going there for his birthday (and leaving the day prior to his birthday) that I'd have a little "birthday countdown" for him and give him a gift everyday. Do these things sound fine?      Sunday - Banjo Tooie 64   Monday - CBJ Rick Nash mini-jersey   Tuesday - CBJ pennant   Wednesday - CBJ Wiimote cover   Thursday - CBJ "street sign" (says Blue Jackets Dr.)   Friday - Framed & Autographed Rick Nash card (favorite player)   Saturday - (his actual birthday; he'll be IN Columbus so I'm going to give his dad a gift and card to give to him from me the day of) ... and that gift is an autographed Rick Nash puck!      Is sending a gift down to Columbus for his actual birthday a good idea or stupid idea?      PS. We've been together for 2 years ... so I'm not being obsessive. I just love making him happy.

20090222165603AAPb3Cx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please read! I would really appreciate it!?	Ok. Soooo... im in 8th grader. And I hate my middle school. I hate it more then anything in the entire world and so i cannot WAIT to get out of middle school and go to high school. The people there...i dont like most of them at ALL. All the people from my school, best friends included, are going to the local high school. Except for me. its a pretty bad school, and my parents dont want me going there, and obviously i dont want to go there either, which im happy about. But im going to a high school thats farther away, with better education,  and i dont know anyone except for my cousin who im not close to at all. So i dont really know anyone. He says hes gonna introduce me to his friends but i want to make my own friends. The high school is on the richer side and im definetly not rich- im able to go there by a a scholarship. So yeah. And im really nervous because i dont know anyone and im afraid i won't make any friends because im not as rich as them. I mean, im sure there are nice people there and not all of them are rich but still. im excited to go there but nervous all the same. Am i worrying too much?
20090222175248AA74jfJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do many people go through life having several different loves?	I was just thinking that I spent years with one man and now thats over. And now I am spending years with a new man. And I was wondering if, for most people, life means not spending time with 1 love. But instead, you end up having a relationship or love affair for years with 1 person. Then it ends. And then you start another relationship with another person.   And so on. And it continues until the day you die.      I think it might be rare for 2 people to meet at a young age, get married, and be together for 50+ years. Do you think it is more common that most people have one relationship after another?      In a way I like meeting new people and it always keeps things new to be with someone else every 5 or so years. So in a way I kind of like the idea of always having a fresh experience every few years. But at the same time it kind of saddens me to think that maybe my life will just be one experience after another with someone different each time. And that I will never have one person I can be with for decades and always count on.      What do you think? Did you meet one person and believe you will be together forever?

For example, they would go out and get some food for 30 minutes but leave the lights on in their room. Or they will leave the TV with no one watching for 15 minutes in their room but they would be upstairs cooking in the kitchen.      I talk to them about this and they apologized, but it doesn't seem like a big deal for them because they keep doing it. Am I over reacting?

20090222183136AAJz0Lr	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why would my best friend act like this?	Well, let's start off with a story: My friend is only 3 days older than me, and our parents have known each other since before we were born. She also lives right across the street from my grandma! (You can see how we met). I've LITERALLY known this girl all my life! We're 14 now.   I used to live with my grandma in kindergarten and we'd play after school almost every day. We were the best of best friends could get.      Well, I moved away since then, only about an hour away. It's also the closest major town, so we go there often, especially to visit my grandma. Well, last summer I spent 2 weeks at my grandma's house and at this point in time I hadn't seen my friend in 6 months. So, her mom has her run an errand over here and she comes in, gives my grandma something, and leaves. She doesn't say "hi" to me or anything. She didn't even LOOK at me directly (like acknowledge I was there) , but I'm sure she saw me, it's not possible she didn't. And no, she wasn't in a hurry, she has no excuses there. When she left she kinda skipped down the driveway a little.    Then the next day her and her mom were cooking dinner. She likes to cook. Well anyway, they were out of corn and my grandma had me run some over there for them. My friend was acting all silly around me now. Talking in a slightly silly tone of voice, and acting goofy. Then when she went to go back inside (we met halfway in her driveway) she kinda did more of a skip then a walk. By now I'm just confused.      We hardly ever hang out anymore because we don't live close by and she's never at home. Between school, homework, sports, after-school stuff, church, church activities, this, that, and more. She's always busy. We used to hang out more than this shortly after I moved, but now it's starting to get were we don't hang out as much... And whenever we do have the chance to hang out we never end up doing it. I really miss my friend and I'm wondering why she's acting like this. When we actually do get to hang out, it's just like the old days when we were best friends. We can talk about anything, but after that we usually don't see each other for long periods of time. We're still friends technically I guess, but it's definitely not like it was.      Now it's been over a year since I've hung out with her, yet we've had a chance to do so last summer, and a few times after that. (By hanging out I mean that I was out of coke to drink, and me and my grandma were outside. Then my friend and her mom were outside, and they were going to the convenience store to get some things. So my grandma sent me with them. When we got back home I grabbed a seat on their front porch and watched her and her mom strip the finish off of a dresser because they were redoing my friend's room. We hardly talked at all, it was pretty awkward.) If you call that "hanging out" then you're pretty lame. I haven't "hung out" with my friend since.      I even asked her if she had a boyfriend while her mom walked away for a second, and she replied, "No." in a VERY quiet voice, not saying anything after that. I did notice she was smiling a little, but NOT out of embarrassment, she was smiling more out of enjoyment. Don't ask me why, I have no idea.       What really gets me is that we've never had a fight. EVER! I can remember only one time in like, 1st. grade. We were playing hide-n-seek. I counted to 20 and she hadn't found a place to hide yet, and I instantly tagged her. So she got mad and we started arguing about what number to count to. When that's your biggest fight, you know you're good friends. That's why I don't understand all of this.         Also, one time when we were like 9 or 10 she came over to play and we went into the playroom. After hanging out for a while she grabs a stuffed toy and starts hitting me with it. It had hard-plastic eyes and I told her it hurt. And all the did was giggle and kept on hitting me.      I know that's like, 100% flirting, but we were only 10 at the most!      So the most recent time I saw her my grandma goes in the laundry room which is were she now keeps the toy chest. I saw the stuffed toy she "beat me up with" and it jogged my memory. So I grab it and confront her about it. I said, "Do you remember this? You beat me up with this!"      She said, "Did I? Are you sure?"      I reply, "Yes, I'm 100% sure you did. Don't you remember? You seriously don't remember?"      Then she says, "Not really, I do a lot of things I don't remember."      She had the same smile on her and the same silly tone of voice as before, like she was happy I brought it up. I thought this was really weird. (but that could be a good thing...)      When we do hang out every now and then we're still good friends and get along fine. She's never said anything about not wanting to be friends, and she's always nice. That's why I don't get it.

And why do "some" women talk down on those women who don't carry a large caboose?

20090222192313AASbczh	Family & Relationships;Friends	School Dance!!!!!! ()-()?	At my school I never go to my school dances because I have no one to go to. I am 13 years old and I am in 7th grade. There has been 4 dances this year so far and I havent gone to one yet. I always get nervous and my friends ask if i want to go with them but I never do. I guess i dont want to go because no boys ever ask me to go to the dance and I always feel by myself or alone. I do want to go to the dance but then i dont because I might be made fun of if i go by myself...I also dont want to go because i dont look good in dresses. I want to know if there is any tips on going to the school dances or ideas to make it more fun. Maybe i can get some help becuase a new school dance is coming up..   Thanks...   *Megggi*

20090222185141AANb0gd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband suffering depression?	After having a baby my husband of 8 years said he needed space and wanted to be alone. He has always had trouble sleeping and still does. He is living on his own and is losing weight. A couple days ago he said he thinks he's been depressed the last week. He constantly says things like he has no feelings and he's numb. He doesn't seem to know anything and he keeps saying it's him not me. He's very negative for the most part. Also his is father was diagnosed with severe depression. So I finally bring it to his attention today and told him that I think that he is suffering from depression and maybe that's why it's getting in the way of our relationship. He laughed it off like I was crazy. Here's the thing he's a police officer and he said that he would know if he was depressed since he is the "Mental Health representative." Something has changed in my husband and I cant' reach him. Could it just be me or is it likely that I am right?? Opinions please.....

20090203101358AAf6NiP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I Have A Problem & I Don't Know What 2 Do About It?	We've been sleeping with each other for almost 2months now.  He didn't tell me he had a gf until a few weeks ago, but we're still each other and we're becoming closer than we intended, and now our mutual friends are suspecting that we're messing around because when we are around each other we can't keep our hands off of one another.   However, he says that I'm about to become a problem he said he can see it coming & may have to ease up on me because I'm starting to act mad.  Like he won't tell me what he does for a living & he's hardly on time when he says he will.  I don't know why he thinks I'm at about to become a problem for him because the way I see it I'm more of a problem to myself.  I think we both know we should walk away but we're becoming attached and addicted to how we make each other feel.  He lies and sneaks off on his gf and sometimes she calls him consistently when we're together.  But he does that because he doesn't want to lose me.  So what do I do about it?  I'm not his problem he's mine and I don't know what to do about it?  I know people will say just leave him alone because he's not going to leave me alone, he's just saying those things to me to keep me in my place.   I told him from now on I'm going to keep my distance from him at the parties & he told me to stop talking crazy.   Well if he thinks I'm about to become a problem isn't that obviously what he wants?

20090203090923AAR7dHV	Family & Relationships;Weddings	HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Should i just move on n forget about her?	i was going out with this girl n she really was in to me n the beginning and then things just went bad. She said she wanted to slow down and she stopped caring about our relationship in my opinion. She didn't call me as much and when i called her to talk to her we would talk for a short amount of time n she would say she would call me back and she never did. Sometimes she acts like she could care less about us and then sometimes she shows me signs that she still cares. She called me up and asked me to go to the movies with her but then she ended up flaken on me.So she really was pissing me off,confusing me and breaking my heart at the same time. So i just said F$#! it and i stopped calling without saying anything. For about 2 months i did not talk to her at all but i still missed her. I felt like the relationship was just unhealthy and i needed to just move on even though i still had feelings for her. I heard from people that some other guy was trying to get at her n they had started going out so i really thought it was over and i have to admit it hurt bad. But not that long after i found out about this some friends of mine called me because they wanted to hang out and when i got to the hang out spot she was there. I was shocked she ran to me and gave me a big hug. The whole time i was just actin natural n jus kind of showing no emotion but when i looked at her she would give me this crazy stare sometimes i don't know why. But when it was all over i heard from my friends she was kind of mad at because i kind of just ignored her and acted like we were never close. So know im just lost i thought this new guy took over but i heard he is mean to her so now i don't know what to do. I think she still likes me but i don't know if its worth risking my heart again but i do love her.
20090222195052AAcLUBN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does he never want to have sex in the morning?	I tried to wake my partner up the other morning to have sex, and he completely turned me down. He rolled over and fell back asleep. I tried to touch him, kiss him, touch myself - nothing worked. I finally got fed up and rolled over angry.      Men: Would you enjoy if your wife woke you up to have sex or service you?    Women: Have you ever had a partner turn you down like this?      It was 8am and we'd had 8 hours of sleep so I'm not sure what his problem was. It's always this way, regardless of how long he's slept.

20090222194653AAP6EgN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I found out that the "boyfriend" I was dating was actually a girl..?	Okay so interesting story here...and it's not so easy coming to Y! Answers and explaining it on here.. so please don't make fun of it because I was completey unaware of what was going on here.      This boy I dated when I was 14, he was 18. Right then and there my parents disapproved and hated it, but being 14 I thought I was always right. He lied about EVERYTHING in his life. He told me he had cancer even.. turns out, he never did. His own mother called my mom and said that he had been lieing about everything and wanted me to stop talking to him.      I was in complete shock that he was lieing to me about all these "little" things, and so we broke up awhile later (we dated for 6 months) because my parents and his didn't approve of our relationship.      Anyway, a couple weeks later a rumor went around my school that "he" was a "she." And no one believed me that we didn't have sex, now that was cleared up. Haha..and no, we never did anything but kiss.       Now, it all came to me. He left his drivers license at my house and it was a girls picture but had HIS name on it. It said "FEMALE." He had plastic surgery pills that had his name on it, and it was for his 'breast reduction' -- it even said. I was so in 'lust' with him that those things completey passed over my head... I was an IDIOT!      Now I'm almost 18 and havn't talked to him in 4 years because I was so upset and felt so betrayed, I never even contacted him again. I am NOT a lesbian whatsoever..this 'guy' definitley looked like a man. Trust me.      This friday I get a text from her/him that said "hi. it's *****" (im not giving out names)      What in the HELL should I do?!?! I don't want to be like "Hey, are you a woman?" but I don't know if I should even text back at all. (I've had a boyfriend for almost 3 years now who I KNOW is a guy, haha, and he says i was messed up when i was younger!) but maybe I should just completely avoid him/her/this person.

20090222195117AAYyNIH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What am I doing wrong?	Every time I try to something nice for a woman, it seems like it gets thrown back in my face.     I buy a flower for V-day for someone once and asked her out.  She laughed and said it was "cute" but no.   I took a date to a really nice restaurant above what I really could afford.  She complained about the place the entire time about she had been to better, more fancy ones.   I was dating this woman once who said she liked this little stuffed dog.  I went back latter that day and bought it for her and gave it to her the next day.  She said, "Huh, thanks."  Never did see it again.   Now my current girlfriend says SHE doesn't like my job because I don't make enough.  I like my job (and not because I HAVE ONE, considering the way things are) and enjoy going to work everyday.  She thinks I should quit and get a hire paying job.  The last two days she has been saying "if you love me, you would do it for me."  It isn't like I don't buy her nice gifts or anything.  We don't live together so it isn't like she wants a bigger place.   What am I doing wrong here?  Why is it no matter what I do, it is not right or good enough?  Your input please?

We both have decided to hold off for a year until I'm eighteen and he's  twenty four to actually be together. We won't see anyone else. Does anyone honestly see a problem with that?       Also Note This before you speak!: I've seen female celebrities who as soon as they hit eighteen go for the 33 year olds! Why do people accept that because their famous, but get so weird about anyone else? Did anyone hear about Paul Walker, he is 35 and dated a girl who was 16 when he was 32 and they staid together! They are engaged to be married. Not all men are perverts or whatever because they find someone young they truly love! I honestly don't think relationships between younger women and older man as a bad thing. Back in the olden days the girls married at freaking twelve to some fifty year old. Why is it such a taboo?
