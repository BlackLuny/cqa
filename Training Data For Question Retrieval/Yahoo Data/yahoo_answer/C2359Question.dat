20090307015456AAPbjgK	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Technology destroying humanity ESSAY!?	I've been asked to explore an idea i have come across in studying the science fiction genre and to reference it with at least two texts.    My idea: We create technology that is so advanced it ends up destroying us.   Texts: Ray Bradbury's 'The Veldt' and also the movie 'The Terminator'   By destroy i don't just mean physically, i mean mentally aswell.   In the essay i'm going to talk about these two texts but also about how technology can impact/destroy our social skills (mobile phones, computers) how we become dependent on technology for entertainment, knowledge, care (TV, game consoles, internet, automated machines) and also how it can affect our health (again TV, consoles, internet)      Is there anything else you can think of that I can add? Do you think I've got the right idea, in terms of what the question asks?   Thanks guys :)

She'd hold my wrists and swing them back and forth(a coach nearby looked away disturbed) or play with the bottom of my track shirt while talking to me. Many times, she'd be talking to me then suddenly get 2 inches from my face, as if to see my reaction, then walk away. She seemed upset when she thought I was avoiding her, she'd asked one of my friends if I was avoiding her...I wasn't, was just going on with my business with my friends. She was rude and ignored me when she found out I was going to another school for the next year. And other things...      There were times though where she treated me like the next student and was pretty rude. She was 39, I was 16, I don't see her anymore.

It was yet another sign of the decline of my academic progress, but that time, the real cost of slacking was in fact tangible.      Granted, my History grades were gradually revived, but I then got less than 90% in a Science test. Admittedly, it was still an A-star, but... less than 90 is rather humiliating...      Soon after, I got 64% in an ICT (information and computing technology) mock exam. Yes. 64. I almost died.       Then, just last week, I got 83% in a Math test. That number slammed into my face like a wall. Lowest Math score I ever got.      Aside from my academic troubles, I've been slacking in training too, and I've lost my place on the school athletics team. I fear I'll soon lose my place on the swimming and cross-country teams too.      What can I do to regain motivation?      Please Help.

20090307033646AAQeK2f	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	College acceptance based solely on gender?	Within this past week I have gone from elated to down right upset, all from one acceptance letter. I am a transfer female transfer student going into a well recognized engineering college. There are 18% girls at the college, so the balance is way off. I sent in my transfer application and was accepted nearly right after I sent it in. I was elated. However, my boyfriend has been fighting with this same school for months. They have partially accepted him, but his grades in the sciences aren't high enough (a's, b's, and maybe a c). My grades are even lower than his in the same classes, but I have had no trouble. He says its mostly cause I am a girl that they hardly even cared about my grades. I wish to believe this isn't true, but no matter how you look, that is only what can be believed. I feel that I cannot morally accept going to this school if I am truly less qualified. What would you say? Is this what has happened? How can I accept?

I'm taking English, Chemistry, Financial Accounting, 2 Period Cooperative Education, and music. Basically, I need 8 courses. That's 6 that I listed. I want to take gym and a computer course. However I don't know which one to pick. For gym I can choose weight lifting, normal gym (1 week = 1 sport and then we switch to another sport), outdoor education (learn how to live in the wild, canoeing, kayaking, etc), or I can choose individual sports (badminton, 3 on 3 basketball, tennis are all part of that). For computers I can either pick programming (Visual Basic) or I can pick animation/graphic design (but I'm not a very good artistic person). So what should I pick for gym and computers. Also, I was thinking of taking physics instead of computers. Is this worth it? Grade 11, by the way. Thank - you in advance.

20090306172209AAypLmU	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	What can I do to not be so bored In class?	High School grows more annoying by the day, because now the burden of being 'top 25 GPA students' is now on my record, and now I'm expected to continue on with those great grades. I keep getting worried for some reason about my grades, even though I try to force myself to accept that I have Bs, because is a fairly good grade, but for some reason, I keep getting depressed.       The problem is, I came up with this crazy idea why I'm so bored in class. That is...Well. We know most people, bored is defined as 'nothing to do'. With me, I think I'm sub conciously ignoring to learn in my classes, because it is just all too easy. I try to pay attention, stare at the board, but never take any of it in. No, I'm not stupid! XD Its just that...I am actually concentrating, but the stuff is just too boring to even bother with it!        Strange, huh? But still, looking back at all those times we did something higher level, I got all of it. I can kind of tell when, and not my brain is actually working. ( For instance, in math, I don't think...And when I do, I question why we are doing what should be elementry school level math).      Anyways, I have a real problem with it. I want to learn, but it just is too difficult when my brain isn't working!       Any ideas at all?

I would be doing college online most likely.  But it would be helpful to know how much I would be making...

Hey, I have a really annoying problem, at my school, I am forced to take spanish, it is mandatory and we don't have a choice of languages.  Problem is well, 1. I hate spanish and 2. I have been studying japanese (pretty actively) before even taking spanish, I really want to continue learning japanese.  As most probably know, it's nearly impossible to learn two languages at the same time (especially when they are WORLDS apart), and because of that I am not doing well in spanish class (and I really need to keep good grades to get into a good high school for next year).  I am afraid that if I stop my japanese study to focus on whatever my school makes me take I will forget a lot (because no high school in my city offers japanese so, thats another four years..)      I really feel this is very unfair to me, is there anything I could do to possibly get excused if I prove that I am in fact actively studying a language at home?      Also, I'm not some anime freak that pretends to learn japanese, I am seriously studying it.  I know both kanas very well, and over 200 Kanji.      This sucks..

20090307011638AAgLIjB	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	School Withheld Full Pell Grant?	I was checking up on my student loans on the NSLDS site, and decided to look through my previous Pell Grant disbursements. I noticed that during my first year 2006/2007 I was awarded $3,000. However, I was only paid $450 by my school. How is that possible?      I've always been a full-time student since I enrolled, never anything less. I've always maintained satisfactory grades. I'm an independent student, 26 yrs. old with dependents. So, I'm confused. Everything I've read says that no other form of financial aid impacts your Pell Grant award, and that the school is to disperse what they award you. Hell, I even had to take out a student loan, and my school decided to decline funds on my behalf. I don't understand, and I'm pretty pissed.       Are they allowed to do this? What can I do?

20090227131356AAIvgYJ	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How do you get around this problem?	I see many, many questions on Yahoo Ask where students and people of school age are asking to a Product Key for Microsoft Office as their 'trial' version has run out of time.   Schools and colleges alike are encouraging people to use Microsoft Office, but they must be aware that it is not free.Yet they offer no alternative.   This is leading pupils and parents (and not all can afford it) to a lot of stress and the temptation to "steal" by looking for the 'pirate' solution, which is very wrong.   What are the Education Authorities doing, if anything, about this? I can see this rapidly becoming a huge problem
20090307042035AAir4iQ	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	A question about the military testing.?	What is the ASVABQMITZ or what ever it is called. Can not this test tell if someone is qualified to serve in the military? Why the requirement for a high school diploma or GED. Is the ASVAB so delinquent that it cannot tell if someone is qualified to serve?   Is four years of wood shop and a diploma more important then a smart individual?   Why should a high school drop out that can score 90 on the ASVAB be kept out of the service because of no diploma?    Shouldn't it be the tests that the military give be able to determine who can serve be enough?    I would think that the testing of your intelligence would be the main factor, Not whether you have a diploma or a GED, by the way the GED test is a breeze, been there done that.   Anyone have some comments?

20090227131636AAAOIzA	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can Someone Edit My Paper!?! Please its due by 4!?	The Ripstik is a Good Invention    Almost everyone knows what  a skateboard is. Many people have had the experience of riding a skateboard or watching someone else riding or doing tricks on one. They have become a very popular exercise, transportation, and sport. The Ripstik is a new type of board that many people don’t know about. It has a resemblance to the skateboard but rides very differently. It looks different and requires different skills than a skateboard. After having experience riding a Ripstik I have come to the conclusion they are a good invention. The Ripstik is a good invention because it has an innovative design, it is a good form of exercise, and it allows people to gain new motor skills.   Innovative Design    The Ripstik is a good invention because of its innovative design. There are many different types of boards on the market today. Many of them resemble the common skateboard.  The Ripstik is like the skateboard but has a very new and different look. It’s body design is completely different than any type of board on the market. The skateboard consists of one board and four wheels. The Ripstik has two separate platforms for standing, and it only has two wheels.  The Ripstik must be powered by rocking the two platforms back and forth, whereas the skateboard has a solid body that cannot be moved.     The Ripstik has an innovative design that makes it easy to handle. Bikes, rollerblades, and scooters are all forms of fun transportation, but sometimes they can be a pain to handle. A bike is hard to store. Rollerblades can easily get separated and be hard to find. Scooters can be large and heavy. A Ripstik is easiest to handle and store. It is light weight, compact, and has a bar that’s makes it easy to carry.       Exercise    The Ripstik is a good invention because it is a good form of exercise. It is a mixture between roller blades and a skateboard. It can easily make you work up a sweat. It takes a lot of energy to ride it. With a skateboard you have to simply push off and the board goes. With a Ripstik you have to sway the board to go. You cannot just get on the platforms and ride, you must put out a lot of effort. This gives you a great work out. Your legs muscles must work a lot just to go straight on the board. It takes a lot of energy, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes really easy and fun!    The Ripstik is a good form of exercise because it takes a lot of practice. Most people can learn to ride the Ripstik very easily if they start off going down-hill. My sister and I started to learn how to ride it by going down the driveway. Just a small slant makes it very easy. After you learn to ride down-hill you need to learn how to ride on flat ground, which can take a lot of practice. It works your muscles a lot harder on flat ground. Going up-hill takes the most practice. You have to sway back and forth vigorously to make it climb a hill. You have to practice a lot to get good at going up.     The Ripstik is a good form of exercise because you will never want to stop riding it. Running is a great form of exercise but running gets old. Who wants to run all day long? A Ripstik never gets old. Once you have learned to ride it you won’t want to stop. It takes a while to learn how to go up-hill but once you can do that you will want to learn tricks. Tricks take a long time to perfect and is a great type of exercise. My little sister said, “My legs were super sore after I practiced all day.” It is definitely a great form of exercise when your body is always in motion.   New Motor Skills    The Ripstik is a good invention because it allows people to gain new motor skills. Like learning how to ride a bike the Ripstik teaches your body new ways to move. Many people are not used to maneuvering a Ripstik back and forth. You must develop new skills to ride a Ripstik. When you first lean how to ride a bike you have to learn how to balance, pedal, and steer, all at the same time. With a Ripstik you have to learn how to balance while directing the board where to go. Balance is one of the most important skills when riding a Ripstik. If you cannot stay on top of the board you won’t be able to go anywhere. You have to be able to balance while turning and swaying at the same time.    Many skateboard fans would say that the Ripstik is not a good invention. The skateboard has been around for a long time and its fan base has grown. Since the Ripstik is a newer type of board many people are skeptical of its abilities. Skateboard fans have a type of bond with the skateboard and will not change their loyalties. Some skateboarders I have talked to say they will not change to a Ripstik. Many skateboard fans don’t see the Ripstik as competition though, and have both a skateboard and a Ripstik.     The Ripstik has become very popular. I see people riding them all over the Harding campus. I bought my little brother one for Christmas because they looked like so much fun. A few days after I gave it to him all the kids in my

20090307030049AAfRYKG	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Having problems with French professor, please help...?	I’m having a lot of problems with my community college French professor.  The class is set-up twice a week, two hours each, for a total of four hours per week of classroom time.  During this classroom time we do not go over the material that we are eventually tested on.  If we ever do go over the material it is only for about 10 minutes per class.  The rest of the time is spent singing French songs, watching videos on French culture, and doing oral work.  This oral work consists of the professor moving from one student to the next, asking her/him a question in French.  The problem with this exercise is that there are over 20 students in the class, which means that after he asks you a question you have to sit there and wait for about 10 minutes while he continues around the class.   The biggest problem that I have is when I receive the chapter test. It looks (forgive the pun) foreign to me.  It is exercises that were not gone over in class, if they were like I mentioned above it was only for a few minutes.  We are required to complete a workbook to be turned in at test time.  This workbook contains app. 30 exercises which are not gone over in class. The students are given the answer key and required to finish the exercises and grade it themselves.  He explained the reason for this being that we are teaching ourselves, and that if we have any questions we can bring it up to him during class.  However, when a student does this, the professor acts as if he does not want to answer, rushes through it, and gives the feeling that we are wasting his time.   Normally I would drop the course and take another teacher.  I took this professor last semester for French 101 and had the same problems.  I met with him to touch base on the class structure, and for him to explain his grading system as he does not give numerical grades. A+, A, A-, B+, B, …and so on.  So with this system I am unable to even keep track of my current grade in the course.    Last semester he was absent and we had a substitute professor teach the class.  She was astonished that we did not know certain things.  She was very active in the teaching of the language, I was impressed with her style and decided to sign up for her 102 course (my current course this semester)  But the community college dropped her class due to low enrollment and put me back with the professor I have had so many problems with (he is the only French professor for 101 and 102)   I understand that this is college and that we are supposed to work independently with our studies, but this professor seems to me to be just lazy.  I study 12-15 hours per week and am blindsided on each test.   I have touched base with the professor on explaining his grading system (which it seems like even he was a little confused about), giving me more exercises to do (which ended up not being on any test), and asking for more information on what will be on the test (which he said he cannot help me with).   I was a straight A student, with a GPA of 4.0 and 51 college credits.  This is the only course that is giving me trouble. I am not the kind of student that puts blame on the professor (I want to teach after college) but I do believe that he is to blame, at least partially.  I live in Virginia and we have a guaranteed admissions program with our colleges and universities where if you earn a certain GPA from an in state community college you are guaranteed admissions to the university.  I am working toward the admissions agreement for UVA and if I have a grade below a C I am disqualified from participating in it.  I hate to admit that I believe, as I don’t even know my current grade in the course due to his grading system, that my current grade is a D.  I need help and do not know what to do.  Can anybody offer me some advice?  The only students that are doing well in the class are the ones straight out of high school who have already had French, in fact, one student I talked with said the only reason he does well is because he had a great high school teacher, and that our current professor is “pretty bad”.  This class is required according to the agreement with UVA and cannot be dropped.      Thank you in advance

Okay, so a few months ago I asked my counselor if I could receive credit for Japanese because I take it outside of school (it's a real class) and do not like the languages they offer at my school. (They only offer Spanish, Latin, French, and German) They say it depends on the school and if they are certified by the county and blah blah blah. This really annoys me; why can I not receive credit for a language that I love, study everyday, and have to have my parents pay for (and it's not cheap) unlike the other people at my school! On the back of the certificate it tells you how many hours you needed to have studied in order to pass the test, and of course I'm going to study more than 150 hours.

This is mine, when Cortez was discovering the Aztecs,      " When we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments (...) on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water, and all built of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream? (...) I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about. " —Bernal Díaz del Castillo, The Conquest of New Spain

All my predicted grades are As and Bs and Distinctions in the BTECs, but in my school, most people tend to perform one grade above their predicted one. So, im hoping to get most As and A*s if not all.    When i went to my college open evening, I really liked the geography department and wanted to take it on A level. I really loved the visual arts department and decided i wanted to take on graphics. For my science related career, i decided to choose biology, chemistry, physics and maths to keep my options open and geography as well as graphics because they were really interesting subjects. They are 6 A levels and im going to drop at least one in A2 year if not 2. But im beginning to think that the workload would be too excessive for 6 As levels and i want to eliminate one from my options but i have no idea which one.    Can anyone help please? i need to decide really quickly!
