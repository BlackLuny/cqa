Based on all that, I suggest you paint the walls white.<br>  I know it sounds stark with the cabinets and all but your choice of carpet is so high contrast that you must do this to preserve the balance of the room and keep it light. This will give it an art gallery feel, then get a clean red sofa, and a chrome and white leather workchair.  See design within reach website for examples. Keep it simple cause youre going to work in this room.  Light it with chrome fixtures all over the place, look for cable or ovoid track lights for the ceiling.

Just trenches (a few feet deep) filled with rock and covered over - will absorb quite a lot of water.|`|p7AT6tDsaa	Your yard, much like mine, needs to be leveled.  Your yard should actually set at a slight grade sloping towards the nearest street or alleyway.  This is so that run off can go to the storm drains easily.  My yard puddles for the same reason.  You can actuall make a small ditch to irrigate the area.  You can have a french drain put in, or you can have your yard leveled.|`|CCSqHVBAaa	The first problem is poor drainage and poor soil. The best way to solve the problem is to create positive drainage. If the elevation of your house foundation is high enough, you ( or a landscape contractor) can<br>  pitch the lawn from the high point at the house to a lower elevation. This creates positive drainage. The soil can also be rototilled to mix<br>  with any new topcoating that may be brought in. You may have to have this new elevation done with a builders level if the existing grade is not workable. Finally, check with local laws governing water runoff<br>  from your property.|`|DxIQJ5m2aa	It depends on a few factors. What kind of soil do you have? Clay will drain the slowest. Is the water pooling in the same area all the time? Check the grade to where the excess water can run off. Do you have a yard next door that their runoff is running into your yard? Can that be diverted. Do you have a septic system or an old one that is full? This could cause flooding. You might want to check out a contractor that can give you an idea of what the cause or causes are. Check with a few of them for an educated decision.|`|AA10979361	It sounds like you have compacted clay-like soil.  Not a nice sandy loam that would take well to lots of rain. <br>  You should aerate your lawn. Call some fertilizer companies to get some quotes. They will want to know about how many square feet of lawn you need aerated. <br>  Or, if you have an equipment rental place near-by, you could rent one yourself & get the job done in an afternoon. Preferably not when the lawn is still saturated. Leave the plugs on the lawn.

gFHTcIc8aa	Its best to apply when soil is moist. You will also want to lightly water after application to get fertilizer to absorb uniformly into soil.<br>  The soil temperature is a driving factor as to the effectiveness of grass growth.  Though the air temperatures are warm, what is the temperature and condition of the soil? Is your grass starting to green? Are you coming out of a cold spell?  <br>  If you apply fertilizer to soil when grass is dormant, you will not get the most benefit from the nitrogen in the fertilizer.  You will get the benefits of any crabgrass preemergent or other nutrients since the soil will absorb these, if not frozen.  If your soil has not yet warmed, you might want to wait a week or two, then apply and water.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	Now, perfect timing.

n560blqraa	Given your wise choices of what you already have in your possession, you have endless options here. Dark brown leather will work against light woods, painted white furniture, a painted color, espresso colored, It really is up to you! I get a lot of questions regarding furniture choices from people. The funny thing is...most people limit their options by way of their original purchase. You have to be the first, that has actually chosen furniture smartly and opened up an array of choices based upon the dark brown leather. The fact that you chose brown leather is what makes it endless also. This goes with glass, marble, stone, painted furniture, antiques, modern, etc. White would be a beautiful stark contrast, while espresso (dark brown) would be a more metropolitan monochromatic look. Something in a maple (reddish/subtle orange undertones in wood) would lend a rich quality to the environment. Glass will bounce light and open up the space visually. If you opt for dark wood, bring in your lighter tones by accent pillows, light colored throw on the couch, vanilla colored candles, etc. to not overwhelm space with too much dark. But anything will work with what you have...depends really on whether you want monochromatic, stark contrast, rich look, country, modern, traditional. <br>  Happy Decorating! P.S.

Brown is a very good base color that can take on any design style you may have - contemporary, traditional, modern, eclectic etc.  With the color being brown, try lighter or darker tones for the new furniture. No matter what the style I would suggest you start with the end tables and a coffee table because these come together as a set. This will help you decide your wood tone or glass. If you choose glass you will have more options in furniture selections - also, it is a good way to open up the floor to show off a spectacular rug or hard wood floors. The next will be a TV stand and then the desk. Listed below is a link for Badcock Furniture for the Coffee & End Tables.

7ZVybmVWaa	Hi<br>  All of the previous answers are WRONG!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  The NEC (national electrical code) dose require a 20 amp circuit to supply the receticles in a bathroom(s).  However that one 20 amp circuit is allowed to supply other bathrooms as well - not just one batroom.  And this circuit should be used ony for recepitcles - not lighting, etc.<br>  But ----- the NEC is not 'retroactive, therfore this reqiurement may not apply to you - depends on when your house was built.<br>  <br>  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO DETERMINE WHAT SIZE OF WIRE IS SUPPLYING POWER TO YOUR BATHROOM.  <br>  <br>  If it is 14 gauge wire then the bigest breaker you can use is a 15amp breaker.<br>  If your wire size is 12 gauge, then you can use a 20amp breaker.<br>  <br>  As for the your GFCI, you can wire other things - including lights and fans the the 'load' terminals of the GFCI.  But I wouldn't.  Just split the power so that a line gose to the GFCI, and then branch out with any subsequnt lines to other loads - as needed.  <br>  Just be sure to follow the code that applies to your house.  If your house was originally was wired with switches, lights, exhaust fan, and recepticle all on the same circuit, then you can redo it in the same way.  However if you were doing a major remodel then you would be required to use the current bulidnig codes.  If in doubt just call the building department - they will tell you what their requirements are.<br>  <br>  As for the tandem breaker - of coaurse you can use one.  <br>  But you are not allowed to have more than 42 breakers in any electrical pannel.  And you may have a issue with the neutral/common (white wire).<br>  This type of problem can arise if you are using a 2 circuit cable, and you don't understand how 'phasing' works.<br>  If you use a 1 circuit cable (romex or MC) you will not have any problems with a overloaded netural/common due to a phasing issue.|`|nD2PwaBLaa	If you want your bathroom up to the very bare minimum, national electric code requires a 20 amp on the gfci. I would not couple that with my lights. This is why: say four 60 watt bulbs for your vanity another in the combo overhead thats 240 watts thats two amps. then another 1.5 or so for the vent. now at 3.5 amps. Small hair dryer is 6-8. thats 9.5. Now add in the threeway you put in the gfci so yourf night light electric razor and your wifes curling iron would all be plugged in while you dry your hair and you are over 85% of the 15 amp capacity. It will also save you money to just catch that two gang switchbox with your hall and attic lights that will be right there. You only need a single pole breaker for the gfci.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	20, minimum.  Consider the useage there, including hair dryer!|`|hZHj0i52aa	Code requires you have a 20 amp GFCI receptacle in your bathroom. You can use that same circuit to power everything else as long as that circuit doesnt leave the bathroom and power anything else.|`|3yV8wUQDaa	NEC (National Electric Code) states that you must have a 20 Amp circuit for your bathroom.  As long as you only use the circuit for the one bathroom, you can run the whole bathroom on the one  circuit.   GFCI is for the outlet.|`|933YqFLNaa	You should check the code for the city/county you live in, best thing to do is that if you do any wiring yourself is that you find a licenses electrician to sign off on it - if you burn your own house down - your insurance may not pay !!|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Electrical code varies by geography.|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	hair dryers use a lot of power 20 amp
goKfNeeOaa	These lady bugs are an imported variety from China.  Native ladybugs spend their winter nestled together at the bases of tree or some other safe spot outdoors.  The imported asian lady beetles are less hardy and therefore must spend their winters in a warmer place like your house.  They will enter your home when temperatures drop in the fall.  When spring rolls around they'll probably have forgotten how they got in and search for an exit.  <br>  <br>  They best you can do is try to seal cracks and crevices that lead to the outdoors to try to prevent them from entering.  You can also get a small vacuum to sweep them up.  You don't even have to feel bad because they're not native.  Come late spring I doubt you'll see any at all.<br>  <br>  Other than being a nuisance, these asian lady beetles won't harm you or your home.  Good luck.|`|diQ0oodqaa	They are inside because they are hibernating, it will pass.<br>  <br>  They were all in my old house when I moved in, I never worried about them, have gone down in numbers since that time, but in winter still get in.<br>  <br>  I didn't think they would hurt me either, till one day I was washing dishes at sink, and one flew toward my neck. I may have hit at it, don't remember, but it stung, bit? me--it hurt terriblly and took about half an hour to stop hurting.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Lady Bugs are consider good luck.

VROdaPOIaa	The best answer will depend on how much saw dust you create in an average hour in your shop. The more you create, the larger the volume needs to be. I shop built mine, and my shop is similar in size to yours. I used a 20 inch fan fit tightly in a plywood box, using two filters, one furnace filter, and a finer second filter for very small dust. I installed mine is a little used corner, on the ceiling, (in my old shop) clean air flow to the wall. I changed the filters fairly often when they looked like they needed it. There are also portable dust collection systems available for between $100.00 to $200.00, but I doubt you can mount them on the ceiling.|`|zM9Lj21waa	i own a jet unit in my shop...  <a href="http://www.cpojettools.com/categories/woodworking/dust_collection/air_filtration.html?ref=ysm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpojettools.com/categories/wo...</a>
0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	I would replace the path, with a path that starts further down the driveway (off the side of the driveway).  The entrance to the pathway should be wide and the path wider than what you have now.  It currently looks like it may be a path to round the back, and this may be your problem.  Make the path curve from the driveway. In the gap between the new path and the door side of the house plant a row of semi shade loving plants (preferably evergreens) and under plant at the front of this bed with a low growing ground cover.  Plant a tall but not too wide tree to the right near your neighbour to block out their house (something like the new tall thin ornamental pears eg pyrus 'capital'.)<br>  <br>  Then put beds (curvy) on the left hand side of the house and the right hand side under the above suggested tree.  make the beds generous in size and the bed on the left side (in picture) will indicate to visitors that there is no entrance there as it will come across to the building with no walkway.<br>  <br>  When you get to the road end of the drive way plant a medium tree on the left hand side (in the picture) at the start of the driveway (but not to close to the driveway) bring the garden bed around to meet it and include it in the bed.  This tree will provide shade to park under and  being close to the front will make the block look larger.  it will also balance the tree on the other side of the garden. <br>  <br>  Be generous with planting, people who design their own gardens usually don't make their beds wide enough (you need a couple of layers of plants - tall at the back and low at the front to make it look good.  Don't pick a lot of varieties of plants just a few otherwise it starts to look 'busy', and don't put in rows of solar lights - nothing looks more ordinary.  Plant the varieties in clumps eg 3,or 5 plants of the same variety and repete the clumps of the same plants around the garden.  This will give you a neat look.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure of the climate where you are so I'm sorry I have been unable to help with plant varieties but your local nursery should be able to sort this out for you.<br>  <br>  If you do the work yourself, draw your plan up roughly on paper, and gradually start to make beds one by one as you get the time to do them.  Lay out the garden hose where you think the edges of the beds should be and you will soon see if they look ok and you can alter if required then mark with landscape marking paint or flour and poison the weed, and grass in the area with something like Roundup.  Leave the required time (Roundup doesn't stay in the soil) and dig when ready.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new garden, nothing enhances the value of your house and lifestyle more than living in a 'park'.|`|FR9HlyYmaa	You have a very beautiful house, and if you lightened up the front yard just a little bit the house will look simply gorgeous.<br>  <br>  It looks like you have weeds in your grass (or is it dirt covered in weeds) and you could maybe just use some weed killer spray and get them gone. Then you could buy a tree (mesquite, dogwood) but it depends on what climate you live in, and you could plant it in the middle of your grass shown in picture 2. You could dig a hole and cover it with fine dirt and put bricks around it. Then line the extra dirt with flowers (verbena, carnations, etc.) <br>  <br>  Then on the house lining, you can put bushes with flowers (but tiny bushes). You could also give your bush on the left a trim, it is very tall and bushy. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5yojyLRRaa	If it were me, I'd take out the green bush at the left side of the front of the house.  It almost seems like the front door should be on that side, and the bush is hiding it.  I'd do a little landscaping on that side (flowers, little plants, etc.).  Then I would have a walkway that went from the sidewalk all the way back to the front door.  It could meet up with the other little walkway.  Then you could landscape around the walkway area near the front of your house.  Good Luck!|`|AA10979361	I would line the walk-way with colorful flowers on either side. Accent them with solar landscape lights.<br>  * Cut out the grass about a foot wide on either side of the side walk.<br>  * Put some edging between the grass & the newly cut out area.<br>  * Enrich the remaining soil with compost, peat, or some kind of humus material. <br>  * Dig in the amendments to a depth of about 12 inches.<br>  <br>  Southern exposure= plenty 'o petunias<br>  Northern exposure= lots'a impatiens<br>  I plant my flowers just a few inches apart for immediate gratification. Plus, the flowers look so full for the whole season! That helps block out weeds.<br>  <br>  Put a pair of taller solar lights at the entrance of your walkway.

fwFmx9kAaa	There are a few ways of doing this, but each depends on the type of lock and how much of the key protrudes from the lock.<br>  <br>  The first method is to superglue or epoxy the key head to the rest of the key and let it set, then gently pull it out. This ONLY works if part of the key is protruding from the lock.<br>  <br>  Another method would be to dissasemble the lock. If the tumbler is the type where the end of the key is visible on the end of the tumbler, then it can be pushed out with a small pin or paper clip.<br>  <br>  The next alternative is to pop the tumbler. If you do it carefully, you can actually keep the lock intact. If not, then you'll have to go through the tedious task of matching up the pins to the key (use an unbroken copy).|`|ibS4vvvgaa	Is this a door lock?  If so---remove the lock from the door---usually there are two screws on the the lock--on the inside of the door.  Unscrew them, remove the lock, take the part that has the broken key in it, turn this part so that the key hole is facing down and tap tap tap the back of that part with the handle of your screw driver.  The broken part will most likely fall out.  Good luck|`|tADSxyqwaa	I pressed blu tack and used it to turn the key and pull but that only works if the key breaks off at the edge - if its overhanging by even a small amount use pliers or even tweezers to pull it out|`|7AUqSr4uaa	Get a locksmith|`|bxlYleZkaa	Pay for the experts to do it for you!

P18qCOtxaa	Steam Cleaning or Dry cleaning alone will not remove urine odor. Urine has salts that are insoluble and cannot be removed unless the right product is used.<br>  <br>  You need an enzyme to digest and destroy the odor. I own a professional carpet cleaning company and enzymes are very effective at eliminating urine odor.<br>  <br>  DO NOT USE ENZYMES ON WOOL OR OTHER NATURAL FIBERS. It will destroy the fibers. 99% of carpet is synthetic.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, water and many cleaning products do not break down the odor causing salts that urine contain.<br>  <br>  Water and many cleaning products often reactivate the ammonia in the salts making it smell worse.<br>  <br>  Urine is a food source that enzymes/bacteria will digest over time.<br>  <br>  TIP: Be careful of what you choose: Many consumer products do NOT contain enough enzymes/bacteria to effectively eliminate the odor.<br>  <br>  We have re-cleaned hundreds of homes that used natures miracle and many others available.<br>  <br>  THERE IS NO BETTER PRODUCT THAN URINE OFF.<br>  <br>  Urine Off is the only consumer product that works very well.

The longer it stays on the more it digests. After about a 14 days it stops working.<br>  <br>  Hot water extraction with a carpet cleaning machine will help eliminate residues that could cause the area to re-soil and turn brown/black. (soils will stick to the cleaning product over time unless it is rinsed out)<br>  <br>  Also make sure you have treated the urine with about the same volume of Urine Off as the animal would pee out. You want to make sure it contacts all of the urine<br>  <br>  For large volumes of urine (medium to large animals) or areas that have been repeatedly revisited you may need to inject the pad with the product. (Urine Off makes a injector for this)<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: use a blacklight to locate the source of contamination. Make sure you treat twice the size of the visible contamination. Urine often spreads twice the size of what you see underneath the surface of the carpet.<br>  <br>  Make sure you read the general instructions and detailed instructions at <a href="http://www.urineoff.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.urineoff.com</a>|`|joiacDUdaa	No, you really can't get rid of urine and pet odors by just spraying it with vinegar, Febreze or any other spray.. You really need to absorb the urine with a thick cloth or even better a wet/dry shopvac especially good for when the stain happens.  <br>  <br>    A small shopvac will cost you about $25 and is great to use all over the house.  Just be sure to remove the paper filter BEFORE using on WET applications... Get yourself a bucket of warm water.. You can add a tiny bit of soap or use shaving foam.. And dab at the stain.. Then use the shopvac as an extraction tool... Dab, rinse and repeat!  Let area dry.. <br>  <br>      Baking soda DOES work IF you absorb any urine before application.. Also, you may want to make sure you vacuum is working in tip/top order.. <br>  <br>      I have a friend and she has 3 dogs with 1 liking to pee/poop in the house... There house smells pretty FOUL... It almost takes your breathe away to enter the house.. Because if one of the animals goes in the house they just spray the area with FEBREZE and they don't absorb the mess.. The carpet looks terrible AND smells even worse... In time the areas that have pee/poop on them crystalize it's pretty gross not to mention unsanitary...<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|vOYyFqxRaa	Use fabreze. They have it with pet oder reducers.|`|zgqAHk66aa	You need to have your carpets professionally cleaned by an IICRC certified Carpet cleaning company. When your pet has an accident, it is not only absorbed by your carpet, but also by the padding and the sub-floor underneath. This can cause bacteria growth in your carpet, padding, and sub-floor. The only guaranteed way to completely remove the odor, is to pull back the carpet, replace the padding and have the sub-floor treated with a sanitizer. The carpet itself can be treated with an enzyme based spotter, that should remove the odor as well as the stain. Your carpet professionals can also use a less invasive(and less expensive method), which is called encapsulation. They would flood the spots with an odor and stain remover and then use a water claw to extract the hot water and product from the carpet and padding. This method is very successful, and very reasonably priced. I would recommend have a stain protector such as Scotchgard or Teflon applied after your cleaning. And be sure to keep an enzyme based spotter on hand for accidents that happen later, it will help prevent the odor problem from happening again.<br>  <br>  And vinegar nor baking soda will help solve the problem. Vinegar is great for removing urine stains that have been sitting and have become alkaline, because it changes the Ph back to acidic, but will not remove the odor. And baking soda will only make it more alkaline (more difficult to remove). Neither will help with the odor, other than to mask it temporarily.|`|AA10979361	You have to try to absorb up the wetness after you spay it with the hope that whatever is making the smell will come up with it. <br>  <br>  Pile on a bunch of dry towels & put something heavy on it.

joiacDUdaa	I live in Ohio and we have hard water... I've never really "looked" after my washing machine and it's been fine.  I prefer liquid laundry detergent as it's already dissolved vs. powder.  I also use 1/2 the amount of detergent and use baking soda.  Which is pretty cheap and helps the laundry soap clean and deoderize better.. So, I get almost DOUBLE the loads from the avg.  detergent... I also find that SOAKING your laundry helps get clothes cleaner as well...<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|alIO8ic0aa	When I lived in an apartment that hard water I added 20 Mule Team Borax to my wash.

If you're looking for a safe method, they aren't it.<br>  <br>  Low hanging branches above your house are commonly used by insect to gain entry to your home.  Trim them back and you may be eliminating the source of these spiders.  Also try distributing some mint sprigs as they are offensive to spiders.

For ink stains you can try the hairspray someone suggested or baby wipes or clear hand sanitizer. For a pencil mark try using a soft eraser to remove any excess stain. Use a clear gum eraser if you have one. Then rub a little liquid detergent into the stain and add a few drops of ammonia. Blot gently, then flush with water to remove all traces of ammonia. Wash as soon as possible. Don't dry in the dryer until all of the stain is removed.|`|cL1K7NHZaa	Is it pencil or marker?

And the two look GREAT together.<br>  <br>  I have a room done in a medium-pumpkiny orange and dark blue, with lots of off-white, and it's a small room ... and I LOVE it.  The orange I used is Behr's "Iced Tea."<br>  <br>  If my colors sound good to you, you could do off-white bedding (maybe curtains, too) and just use the dark blue here and there as an accent ... maybe as pillows, a stripe on the curtains, and accessories.<br>  <br>  Most people think orange will be loud or garish, but the right shade is gorgeous.  Just resist the urge to go too bright, and you'll be fine.|`|MdqFclDbaa	only if you are a pumpkin!|`|vsuXCMqzaa	If you really like the color try painting only an accent wall orange and the rest possibly a light tan or some other neutral color that won't take away from the orange (like sand or eggshell or a really really light orange-ish white). By doing an accent wall it will be easier to "match" your bed and accessories without clashing. Also, it would look really nice if the accent wall was painted in a high gloss, then it will also a shine a bit. <br>  <br>  If you like the brown and orange combo already, you can go with a brown bedspread with orange sheets and awesome orange pillows. If you like the oriental look, you can go with a redish bedspread and then accent with the oranges. Another cool option is a dark purple bedspread with orange accents and orange wall...the dark purple will really make the orange pop.<br>  <br>  Just remember to Have Fun and do the colors that you like! And if it ends up not looking like what you pictured on the walls, you can always repaint it. So, you really can't go wrong.|`|AA10447831	no, go with an off white and accessorize with pumpkin. use pillows, vases even a bedspread instead.|`|mlAFvumUaa	naww, you might not believe this but you wont like it in a few years<br>  go for lighter tones<br>  besides it might clash with your furniture<br>  wwww.styleathome.com will have some great colour ideas|`|PogMq7Pcaa	eh nope!<br>  <br>  idk though wut othr pumpkin ornge is just blah<br>  <br>  choclate?|`|9gMQAWBNaa	I'm an illustrator/designer and work quite a bit with colour. There are problems with picking a really bright colour like orange in that you get sick of it pretty quickly. <br>  Think MacDonald's with their orange seats and wall colour, the idea for that orange was meant to get people eating quickly and out of there fast. It really depends on how often you redecorate, if you are willing to live with that colour for awhile. <br>  If your furniture is an orange brown I would suggest a green that you like, to give a really relaxing feel to the room, sheets could be orange and or green or even whites or pale greenish blues. You want your bedroom to be a place that is a bit calming and stress-free, almost your refuge from the world. I would choose cooler colours with greens and blues.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	not pumpkin orange, that would be way too dark and make the room look smaller.  a light orange on one or two walls would be ok.  Painting all of the walls enclosed the room and makes it look smaller. a orange and brown pin stripe sheet would be good. blending colors without using all solids is the trick.|`|srccpKEhaa	I dunno...Pumpkin orange is a little...much.

Based upon your room size, go for it. It really does give such a rich look against dark woods. I have it in my family room. It gives such a soothing feeling, especially when the sun begins to go down, it reminds me of a beautiful sunset. Pair this against black sheets, chocolate brown. or pure white. Absolutely go for it! This is a very sophisticated rich look. When I did it, people thought I was crazy until after it was done, they loved it, including the guys.

Maybe one of the answerer's suggestion of pin stripes (I'd love to have a pin striped room!)?<br>  <br>  If you are really set on the color and you don't think you will mind your room possibly looking smaller, I say, go for it.

It can be covered."|`|AA11041425	I love that color as well.  However, in a small room, it may be best to paint half the wall that color, then paint the other half in a lighter color, so as to alleviate some of the darkness (which will make the room look smaller).  Try caramel colored sheets or olive green.  Both of those shades look great with that shade of orange.  Or, if you are going to use a border, you can coordinate with your border.|`|p1oKWwsSaa	I like the pumpkin orange.  Milk chocolate would be a good color to go with it.  Who doesn't like pumpkin or chocolate?  It would make a nice sophisticated blend.  Consider adding textures as well (velvets, linen, woven grass blinds, satin, etc.) in those same colors.  Stay in this color pallete and you can't go wrong!|`|vlViRaKFaa	what ever you like... it would kind make the room fell small.. go with a light Orange, or even like a yellow!|`|r5k8Nkreaa	nope cause if ur fat thats bad because the coler orange makes you want to eat,but if ur skinny go for it :]

n560blqraa	I own a home remodeling company, and I am a decorator also who invests in properties and turns them back out on the market. <br>  <br>  When I have done homes that are light grey in color, I have used black shutters b/c it is more timeless and elegant allowing for great curb appeal and greater resale value. .With black shutters you can opt for a red/burgundy door for more striking appearance or stick to a black door. <br>  <br>  The other color I have used is a wine/burgundy color which lends itself beautifully for a more stark contrast against the light grey, and have tied the burgundy shutter back into the house with burgundy, wine, cranberry toned plant life, surrounding the front of the house. <br>  <br>  I love the color plum personally, but for resale value and greater curb appeal I would stay away from it. Instead pick up the plum color through your plant life to enjoy it. Plum colored plantings will work with either the above mentioned colors, while still allowing you to enjoy some of your favorite color without the permanency of placing it on a front door or shutters. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Happy Decorating!   :0)|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Any dark color will stand out nicely against the light grey, so it's really just a matter of what you like best.<br>  <br>  If you love plum, absolutely do that!

gFHTcIc8aa	I had a similar situation with my old Kenmore.<br>  Is the water coming from the top (inside freezer on a top freezer model) and leaking down into refrigerator?<br>  Is there ice buildup along the bottom surface of freezer?  (You may have to remove a plastic cover in bottom of freezer to determine).<br>  <br>  Ice may be blocking evaporator drain hole at the back, central base of freezer about 1" in diameter. You will need to remove a few plastic panels to verify this--should be held in by a couple of screws.<br>  Excess water from the evaporator will drain through this hole.  If it becomes clogged (as with ice or debris) it will back up.  Excess water from the evaporator instead of draining will trickle down into refrigerator area.  <br>  More than likely, either your evaporator is failing, a leaky seal causing the partial thawing of freezer, or your defrost cycle is malfunctioning.<br>  <br>  If you verify that the evaporator drain hole is clogged, you will have to remove as much ice as possible and pour boiling hot water down the hole to clear.<br>  <br>  This will be only a temporary fix if the evaporator is faulty.  If you need to replace the evaporator and your refrigerator is old, you may want to considering replacing.|`|dGRq65eraa	Your defrost drain trough is most likely plugged.

Complementary colors usually go very well together.<br>  <br>  Purple and yellow can look lovely together, but not equal amounts of each.  Better to emphasize one and use the other as an accent.  Also, the lightness or darkness of the colors themselves will affect how good they look together.<br>  <br>  Purple and yellow is a combination often seen in nature ... purple flowers with yellow centers, for example, and mixing purples with yellows is a favorite trick of gardeners and landscapers because the two colors intensify each other, which is interesting to look at.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	It matches for Barney, so it all depends on what you are going for.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	VIKINGS! jaja tjeu suck<br>  <br>  (haha they suck_|`|p1oKWwsSaa	Purple and yellow are opposites on the color wheel.

It is most likely that you don't have water rights. There are many instances where people live near a lake but don't actually own the water. Often times it is owned by farmers or the city or someone else and they can legally do whatever they want with the water and there isn't a think the homeowner can do.<br>  <br>  So check to see if you have water rights.

The rules for bodies of water can vary from state to state. You may find you do not own the lake.|`|l9xnybUMaa	So you are saying that the neighbors are stealing your water?<br>  Or that there are drainage conditions that are diverting the natural flow of water from your lake to theirs?<br>  Check with your county planning department.<br>  Until you know HOW this is happening and can prove it, its hard to address it.  Since you can see it, see if you can mount a measure stick in the lake and take a weekly photo of the measurement to quantify what is happening.  A scientific approach to find out exactly would be necessary, and to decide who will pay for this.  A dry lake is going to devalue your property so you must adress this fast.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Since you said the 2 lakes are basically connected the levels will be the same.

Sure.<br>  It'll be great practice for when you have to do the job a second time after you level it.|`|n560blqraa	Absolutely Not!!! After tile is laid down and you level house, it will cause cracking everywhere in both grout lines and in tiles. Wait until house is leveled for a smoother more level finish for permanency.

ekr7IlX7aa	I removed 7 layers of wallpaper from my dining room last year.  Usually, I use a metal spatula and spray bottle of hot water.  Peel off what you can, spray the hot water, wait a few minutes for it to saturate, go back and scrape (gently, you don't want to gouge the drywall), finally wipe down with an old wash cloth.<br>  <br>  When I did the room with 7 layers, it was so old that I rented a steamer from a hardware rental place.  It worked well, but if you're only removing a couple layers, I wouldn't bother.

y31mee4Faa	There's a pretty good chance cobblejoe's right about the slow drain, but the toilet draining sounds like a siphoning problem from lack of an air vent on your washer drain.  Is your washer drain between the tub, toilet & sewer line to the outside?<br>  <br>  Do you have a relatively new washer?  Some of the newer units pump out faster & with more pressure than old washer drains can handle.  Had a similar problem when wifey decided we needed a newer model a couple of years ago.  Old machine pumped out in 3-4 minutes, new machine takes about 2.5 minutes.  The drain was 18' from the sewer pipe/vent stack that it emptied into...had to have a new vent stack installed next to a new drain line.<br>  <br>  If this is your house, you may have to have your lines checked for blockage & proper venting.  If this is a rented property, it might be a iffy situation with your landlord.  <br>  <br>  If you are in a rental & the landlord is not forthcoming with a solution, you could always get a freestanding utility sink, plumb it into your washer drain & drain your washer into the sink...it will gravity drain & should stop your toilet draining & tub backup.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|d8cEFwmqaa	My guess is that the sewer drain from your house out to the main sewer drain is getting blocked by tree roots.

They are a lot easier to put in than digging and pouring, but they will not last indefinitely.  If this is going to really be a permanent structure, I would go with the concrete slab. Put some mesh in it so you don't have to worry about it cracking, and use PT for your bottom plate and your shed will last much longer.  Another trick, buy some of the "fake" wood decking used for patios.  Its a bit pricey, but you don't need that much. Spend the money, and take the time to rip them length wise, then use the "strips" you cut for your bottom plate.  They do not rot, and bugs are not so thrilled with them.

I would imagine because paper is made from wood and being partly biological (exclude the ink and paper milling process) it would gradually fade and rot. The paper may have been in different environments like smoke and dust. Old books are usually bound by leather or kept locked away in storage so air would not get to them. Plus you never know whats been nibbling them like paper beetles. It probably all adds to the smell or am I just rambling!!!!
joiacDUdaa	We have a DIRECT-BUY showroom near where we live.. Some friends of my in-laws bought into the membership and I belive it was around $5k to join.  It was a total sham... The savings were only about 2%-5% over traditional home improvement stores like LOWES or HOME DEPOT.  The prices that they "quote' on television are full price or suggested retail sales prices... MSRP's ... Also if you have a contractor and they need to order or go to the Direct-Buy showroom they are not allowed in there.  Even if you go with them... Which can cause problems if you need something measured or custom made.  Ultimately, the couple sued DIRECT-BUY to get a portion of their membership back since the savings didn't amount to much...They also said the service at least at the OHIO location was pretty marginal and some of the things they ordered didn't come it right all in all it was kinda a mess.  They would NOT recommend it to anyone... <br>  <br>  My father in law is a contractor he's the one that did the work to their house... <br>  <br>  I work at LOWES and we have some pretty decent prices on "kitchens and bath's" as well as, people that design order and install....

The big box stores can sell you the boxes (cabinets) at a really low price.  Where they get you is the embellishments.  By that I mean the molding at the top of the cabinets, the self closing doors, the hardware, the design on the doors if you want anything other than a flat panel door.  These are just a few of the things that they charge extra for.<br>  <br>  So let's just say you go to home depot and price out a kitchen for $30000 which is not an extremely expensive kitchen at todays prices.  You are probably not getting everything you would like to have in the kitchen, but may be satisfied.  Now say you paid the $5000 to join DirectBuy and they designed your kitchen with the exact same stuff, but the cost was only $20000.  Now the kitchen with the $5000 included only costs you $25000.  You could add another $5000 worth of upgrades, maybe granite counter, nicer doors, anything you wanted and you would still be ahead.<br>  <br>  Also, you are buying DIRECTLY from the manufacturer.  You get the same warranties they offer on everything.  When you go to a furniture store and look in their catalogs, you are looking at EXACTLY the same catalogs in the DirectBuy showroom, except you are paying what the store is paying.  So depending on their markup, you could save anywhere from 20 to 40 percent, or more.<br>  <br>  Granted, if you are looking to furnish one room, it is not going to be worth it to you to join.  But if you are building a house you cannot lose with a DirectBuy membership.  They sell everything you need for the house except the foundation.  I literally mean the nails used to build the house, the framing wood, the electric wire, everything.  And you are saving more that 2 to 5%.  I don't know where the people that are claiming that got their information.<br>  <br>  Please notice that the people that speak against DirectBuy are those that did not join.  You don't hear too many people that are members complaining.  I personally know of one person that built a $500,000 home using everything from DirectBuy and saved probably half that much again. ($700,000 minus $250,000 equals $500,000). Not bad for a $5000 investment.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	The membership fee is $5000.00. I went to check this out for myself as we were building a house and buying almost everything. I went there knowing the prices I could get for several things locally..direct buy could not beat the prices I could get locally, and I am not a contractor. Some of their quality was not as good as what I could get cheaper. They do not deliver for free, they do not install..you must arrange that yourself. It is a scam..save your money..buy locally and you will save yourself a lot of money, and have a company to back your purchase and install with a guarantee. They didn't like it when I told them they were a rip off..I did not join and I would strongly suggest you do not either.
hWd50Lk8aa	Danny,<br>  <br>  You bonsai destroyer.<br>  <br>  The ficus probably had spider mites and they will really knock a plant back.<br>  <br>  Water as usual, and keep in full sunlight if possible. This time of year can be a challenge unless you have a greenhouse. Around May (depending where you live) set it outside for the summer. Let it shoot out as much growth as possible, then start selecting dominate branching in August. It may be that you have to let it go for the entire year just to get some form back.<br>  <br>  I purposely trimmed mine like yours because I did not like the top branches. 6 months later it is looking fine.<br>  <br>  Suggest you get a book or two on bonsai to get a much better idea on what to expect and learn some beneficial tips.<br>  <br>  Now go drink a beer and relax.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	Possibly might be too late but don't give up yet. Keep babying it and put it in some good sunshine and give it some time, see if anything starts growing again. If after a month or two it still looks the same, it's probably gone.<br>  <br>  For the remaining stump, is it green inside or dried up brown? If it's dried up then that also may be an indicator but still don't give up because there may be a bit of life in the roots.|`|KtMpAZ2yaa	I think you should keep trying to save your ficus bonsai. If the plant has been in the same pot for quite a while, consider repotting it, and after repotting keep it under the shade of a bigger tree. Pay proper attention to the watering schedules( you are already doing that ) <br>  <br>  Hope this will revive your ficus bonsai back to life again.

AA11988490	I will try my best to help you! <br>  First of all, I like to put the soap & water in together, and let them get a little sudsy---just enough so the water & soap mix together.

I usually dry them on medium or heavy.|`|D97HkxrVaa	Start your water and add the detergent and let it fill a little bit until it mixes then add the blanket.

So the powder will dissolve. I do the same with liquid for no apparent reason.  You can tumble dry on med. or low heat. To keep them fro shrinking|`|bjSVClquaa	First, check the care tags on your blankets for cycle & temperature (just in case they're wool or dry clean only).  Only wash/dry one blanket at a time.  Follow your directions on the machine for loading clothes.   Usually it tells you to put the detergent in, then load the clothes, then turn the machine on (that's when the water begins to fill the tub).  It is not necessary to let the soap dissolve before putting the articles in- maybe 20 years ago, but not now.  The only time you'll have a problem with the soap dissolving is when you have crammed the washer too full of items & they cannot freely agitate.  Also, machines have a gauge for the water's fill line that is not correct for the load if you let it fill, then put in the items (it is then overfilled).  Follow the care tag instructions for drying.  If you use the dryer & these are relatively thick or large blankets, you'll need to take the blanket out every 15 minutes or so, shake it out, & put it back in, so that it doesn't get all knotted up with the center wet & the outside dry.  Best of luck to you!

7ZVybmVWaa	In your situation, what you have is power feeding into the box , then to the receptacle (supplied by the incoming wires), then the power goes through the receptacle (via the jumpers) to the out going wires - to supply power to your next box.<br>  <br>  Break off the jumper on the hot side (brass colored) terminals.  Then attach the switched hot lead to one of the brass terminals. <br>  Put the constantly hot lead onto the other terminal.  It dose not matter which terminal you attach either of them to - it will work fine.<br>  <br>  Put the neutrals back onto the chrome terminals.<br>  <br>  Do not break off the neutral/common jumper tab (chrome colored).<br>  Remember that the power goes through the receptacle, then across the jumper to the next set of out going wires.  If you break off the neutral jumper the power will not be able to go out to the next box.<br>  <br>  As for the ground - yours is wired wrong, and you should redo it.  The correct way is to take the two ground wires and 'pigtail'  them togrther.   Use a pair of plyers, and a short piece of wire that has green insulation, or is bare (strip the insulation off).  Twist the two existing ground wires and the new short piece of wire together (use the plyers).  Then attach the 'new wire;, to the grounding terminal on the recepticle.  Place a wire nut onto the twisted wires.<br>  <br>  SAFTEY NOTES****<br>  And of course - shut the breaker off.  You might still get a shock from the other wire though - the common/neutral (white wire).  This s because the NEUTRAL is somtimes shared by 2 circuits.  When this happens the neutral is then refered to as a 'common' wire.  Because it is common to two different circuits that use 2 different breakers.  <br>  A shock from a neutral/common can be kinda BRUTAL.  Been there my self a couple of times.<br>  YOU SHOULD USE A VOLTAGE TESTER TO TEST FOR VOLTAGE FROM THE WHITE WIRE TO GROUND (green or bare wire).<br>  If you do not have a voltage tester - the safest way to do it would be to turn off all of the breakers.|`|ywOqliwKaa	You just wired it wrong, or you forgot to break off the tabs on the side of the plug that isolates each receptacle from the other.<br>  <br>  First, open the breaker (Or probably breakers). Sounds like two circuits involved, one for the switched and one for the constant plug.Make sure all wires are not hot.<br>  <br>  By testing from hots to ground, determine if it is two different circuits, and determine which is switched. <br>  <br>  One hot and one neutral will go to top plug. One hot and one neutral to the other. Make sure you break off the metal tabs on the side of the new plug so each receptacle is isolated from the other. Grounds just go to ground together.|`|U5nOLiJmaa	WOW!<br>  You are correct, on switched plugs there are 6 wires!<br>  <br>  I recommend shutting of the breaker, then remove your recieptical (disconnecting the wires) and then turn back on your breaker.<br>  Using a voltage tester or cheap idiot light, test your wires. Put the black lead on a ground or white wire (any of them will work), then put the red or other test lead to the black wires , one at a time. You should get power on one of them, if both black wires have power, shut of the switch, one of the black wires will lose power.<br>  <br>  The black wire that looses power is the one controlled by the switch.<br>  Mark this one "A" and the other  one "B".<br>  <br>  On your recieptical sides, where the screws are, you should see two brass tabs (thin brass metal). On the (hot) side ----this is the side that usually had brass colored screws, you need to snap the thin metal to separate the  recieptical into two circuits. NOTE: the other side is the white wire side and those screws should be silver.<br>  <br>  Once the above is done, it's time to rehook-up the wires. <br>  I always start with the grounds and connect them to the  green screw and tighten them down. Then move to the white wires, connect both of them to either one screw or you can separate them and connect each one to each screw. NOTE either way will work.<br>  <br>  Now for the black wires<br>  Take the "A" black wire and connect it to the bottom recieptical brass screw. NOTE - once this is connected, you can test the recieptical by plugging in the tester into the blade area where you would normally put a plug into., Now turn on your breaker and observe the tester, there should be no light or needle movement. Now turn on the wall switch, you should get a light or needle movement. If all worked ok,  the only thing left to do is shut off your breaker again, then connect the other black wire to the upper brass screw and tighten.<br>  <br>  Now re-install the recieptical back into the box "still with the power off.<br>  Tighten the two screws down.  Now turn back on your breaker and all should be well again.<br>  <br>  Remember to put your faceplate back on the rcieptical and you are done.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3yV8wUQDaa	What happened to the old adage of " HIre a professional?"  Did you take out the blade that joins the two hot sides?  Your switch should just control the top side of the receptacle.  That should be your continuity on your single pole switch.  The bottom side is wired to a hot, neutral and a ground.  Good fire insurance would be in order.  If you call it a jumper, remove it on the hot side.  Turn off the power to this circuit and call an electrician.  The feedback from not having removed the blade (jumper) in the outlet could be the reason the other lights are lighting on this same circuit.  You need help.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	A standard duplex outlet has two screws on each side. If you look closely at the construction, you will see that between these screws is a thin jumper. This can be removed to seperate the top and bottom receptacle. MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THE JUMPER FROM BOTH SIDES . Then wire up each one with the black wire to the gold screw, the white wire to the silver screw, and the grounds to the green screw.( these can go together)

AA12330575	Unless you 'float' every square inch of your job, you will see all joints and fasteners when you paint.  Texture is not, nor was it ever, intended to hide shoddy work and, in fact, it will not hide imperfections in your drywall job.  Texture, with the exception of ceiling 'popcorn', is merely used to give your job a uniform finish.  All drywall has texture and when you apply drywall mud to joints and fasteners you change the texture of the wall at those places while the texture at places that do not receive a coat of mud will have a different texture.  If you float (cover with mud) the entire job you will then have a smooth texture.  Floating the whole job is labor intensive and that's why drywallers charge more money for a smooth finish.  Your best bet is to rent a pattern pistol (texture gun) and shoot the job with a light texture.  Right now, you have two different textures (where you've mudded and where you haven't) and it will absolutely show in the finished job.  I've been a drywall contractor since 1960.  I know whereof I speak.  Good luck.|`|AA10097817	My dry walled walls are not textured. Paint with a primer and then a top coat.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	You still need to prime the drywall.

You must have done an exceptionally good job, though, for your walls to come out so smooth - most contractors charge more for smooth walls, because it takes so much more work to finish walls off smooth - it seems like every little flaw shows on smooth walls, even things like, say, a stud being a little crooked, too.  However, if you're happy with it there's no reason to texture at all.|`|znFpsUTaaa	I will put in my two cents on this one.  The other answers all make sense.  If the seams look good, why should you have to do any texturing?  What you have to do is make sure you do a drywall primer over the drywall and the mud.  Two coats are better than one.  You will get a better picture of any imperfections once you prime it.  If it still looks good to you, great.  Pick a good paint, either flat, satin, or semi gloss (I would never put gloss on verical walls unless it was a kitchen and lent itself to that kind of look and for ease of washing the walls).  I prefer satin since it is a softer look and does not look "dry" to me in sunny conditions.<br>  I have remodeled houses that had existing walls with lots of imperfections that would be too costly to tear out and fix or repair, and I have texured the walls lightly, but I have not done that when the wall looks good.|`|ywOqliwKaa	No. Most are not.|`|ekr7IlX7aa	No, most people don't texture, unless they're looking to achieve an "old style" look.
