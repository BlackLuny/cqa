rZZjj0y4aa	I believe it is a Greek custom. The restaurants here in the United States even have Gyros, and lamb kabob's. I have seen A lot of travel cooking shows that show them consuming lamb in a lot of their dishes. A lot of the family meals consist of 12-16 course meal each consisting of a different kind of lamb product.

k4f7HG8waa	Cam's got a good point.  A regular beer's got about 150 calories, and a basic mixed drink made with vodka, rum, or whiskey will have about 180-200 calories. But beer contains only between 1.5 and 6 percent alcohol, while mixed drinks are basically 50 percent.  So it takes a heck of a lot of beer to equal the same alcoholic punch as one drink made from  vodka, rum or whiskey.  Makes it easy to put on the pounds if you drink beer.<br>  <br>  Remember, it's going to take a good half hour to feel the full effects of any alcoholic drink. <br>  <br>  Health-wise, it's said a glass of red wine a day is good for the heart, because of some ingredients specific to red wine (as opposed to white).<br>  <br>  Last, but not least:  Don't drink and drive. And don't drink and dial (or text). :)|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Red wine contains anti-oxidants.  This is why many nutritionists recommend it. I am a type 2 diabetic and it is the only alcoholic beverage i am permitted to drink.<br>  <br>  If you want to gain weight by drinking, I suggest sugary soft drinks.  However, neither sugary soft drinks nor distilled liquor is good for your long term health. You might want to consider protein supplements to gain weight.<br>  <br>  If you want to get high quickly, you have to consume alcohol quickly and on an empty stomach.  Distilled liquor mixed with carbonated beverages get into your bloodstream a little taste than either beer or liquor on the rocks.|`|0191j9waaa	Wine is more healthy.<br>  <br>  you can sleep more  ( especially after lunch, have a nap.) to gain more weight! try one month!|`|ycRwO0kWaa	none|`|Oor1CJ5laa	I wouldn't recommended drinking just to gain weight, still, it does work. Beer or cider (high sugar content) will probably make you gain weight faster since you can drink more. Wine is better for you (especially red, the tannins are good for the heart - although in moderation). Vodka and white rum may make your hangovers easier to deal with (clear spirits are said to make you less sick than darker spirits), and you should mix them with something - which adds plenty of calories.<br>  <br>  Be careful though - I'd try more food, not alcohol to gain weight..|`|oGCcPQ1Xaa	heyy... <br>  <br>  defantly if your drinking it straight go for vodka or wine,<br>  <br>  wine is the best the vodka and whiskey is best for weight if thats what you want, <br>  <br>  charlea<br>  xx|`|JE8lRn7Caa	Try Captain Morgan Spiced rum with Coke I drink it with diet coke but you want to gain weight.

5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	doesnt make a difference. <br>  hot milk + chocolate sauce, or you mix them first then heat. <br>  i think hot milk then chocolate sauce tastes better though. its also easier and faster to mix.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	heat up the milk first, it helps all the chocolate mix in when you add it|`|f1WPqalUaa	Heat the milk first, then add the sauce. In the European way of making hot chocolate, where the solid chocolate chunks or chips are melted in hot water (ie, your "sauce"), the hot milk is added to it. I think this is a good method, but backwards!<br>  <br>  If you want the perfect amount of chocolatey-ness, why not have your hot milk ready, then add sauce and taste it, adding more if necessary, until it is PERFECT!<br>  <br>  Now, if you go with cocoa (powder), you have a similar problem, which is premixing a set amount of chocolate. You mix your cocoa powder in the bottom of the mug with some *cold* milk or cream, warm the milk separately, then add the hot milk s-l-o-w-l-y, stirring it into a smooth paste, gradually adding milk, ensuring no lumps form (yech!). Notice this gives you less control over the level of chocolatey-ness, because you have to premix the powder in the bottom of the mug, and you can't really add more later, unless you are using something like Swiss Miss or Nestle's, which isn't "real" connoisseur's cocoa (eg Green and Black, Scharfenberger, or Droste's) but instead has been so totally processed it dissolves easier.<br>  <br>  For a tasty difference, try adding a little Ancho chili powder just like the Aztecs did!|`|oGCcPQ1Xaa	heyy ...<br>  <br>  put in 3 teaspoons of hot choc powder and howevva many of sugar it is that you have and a tiny bit of milk (by tiny i mean tiny tiny tiny) and stir it will go like dough and then turn into a paste then add either hot milk or hot water either tastes good however hot milk does have a tendancy to taste better than water. mix and as a added bonus add whipped cream and grated chocalate lol :D <br>  <br>  charlea <br>  xxx|`|8BGehWCoaa	Warm the milk about halfway (either in the microwave or over the stove) and then add the chocolate sauce.  Take a little taste to see if it needs more chocolate added, then heat it up the rest of the way.  The heat lets the chocolate melt in better for a more even consistency.|`|9ZCLZXZyaa	I prefer to add the sauce/powder after the milk is hot.  I think it tastes a bit better but it is up to personal preference.

Peel the onion, cut it in half, chop one half into tiny pieces and save the other half.<br>  <br>  Open the tin of tomatoes. Put the juice into a bowl. Chop the tomatoes while they are still in the can (it’s easier than chasing them around the bowl). Put the chopped tomatoes into the bowl. Use 100g and save the other 300g. <br>  <br>  Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and fry for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the mince, chicken, prawns, mushrooms or vegetables. Fry for another 3 to 4 minutes, until any meat is an even colour, with no pink bits. <br>  <br>  Add the rice and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the herbs and tomatoes. Crumble the stock cube into the water. Add some of the stock to the pan. Mix thoroughly. Add some more of the stock to the pan. Mix thoroughly. Repeat this until all of the stock has been added to the pan. <br>  <br>  Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Continue to cook, stirring as the mixture boils, for another 20 to 25 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked. If it looks like it is getting dry, add some more water and stir. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES<br>  <br>  Substitute 125ml of white wine for 125ml of the water. You can use left-over cooked chicken, but add it at the same time after all the stock has been added.  <br>  <br>  TIPS<br>  <br>  This dish needs an eye keeping on it all the time to make sure that it cooks properly but stays moist. <br>  <br>  * Plum tomatoes can be used either whole or chopped.

53giV6PFaa	Hmmm...think I'll make these tonight myself!<br>  <br>  I love country fried steak or chicken fried steak.  I have tried many recipes, and combined the best of all recipes to create my own. <br>  <br>  I use cubed steak.  If your grocer doesn't have cubed steak, ask the butcher to put some round steak in the cuber.  <br>  <br>  In one dish put in buttermilk, it makes a the coating stick on it the meat much better than an egg wash.<br>  <br>  In another dish, put in flour with some garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and I have put in cayenne pepper for a kick, but you can omit it.<br>  <br>  Salt your steaks on both side.  <br>  <br>  Put about 1/2 cup of oil in your skillet and heat your skillet.  <br>  <br>  Dip steak into buttermilk then flour.  Fry steaks 2-3 at a time depending on your skillet and steak size (don't over crowd the pan) in hot oil.  Fry about 5-6 minutes on each side until brown.  When done put on a paper towel lined plate to get the grease.<br>  <br>  To make gravy, pour out oil except about 2-3 tablespoons.  Add about 2 tbsp of flour to the pan and mix the flour with the oil and the cooked bits - scrape the pan bottom to get all the cooked bits up.  When it gets bubbly, pour in milk (about 2-3 cups) and cook until thickened.  Add more milk, if it's too thick.  Add cracked pepper and salt (if needed).<br>  <br>  I serve this with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob or some good green beans.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	egg wash, and flour pan fried with white country gravy, served with hot biscuits, mashed potatoes (with more gravy on it) and fresh green beans.

You might invest in an oil filter if you deep fry a lot (no longer PC), but coffee filters or a sieve can work.  Slowly add warm milk to the pan remains to make the gravy - don't boil just keep hot.

First, merely rubbing baby's gum's can ease the pain by creating opposite pressure; second, the alcohol in vanilla extract will create a warm sensation that is temporarily comforting. The third way this remedy may work is in the calming properties of vanilla itself. Vanilla is known as a soothing yet energizing agent that reduces anxiety and promotes feelings of well-being. Besides that, vanilla has long been used to cure stomach distress: a baby whose stomach is mildly upset from crying or swallowing large amounts of drool may find vanilla soothing to the tummy as well as the nerves.<br>  <br>  In the U.S. for vanilla extract to be considered pure vanilla extract per the FDA it has to contain at lease 35% alcohol. <br>  <br>  They do have this at most grocery stores in their spice aisles.  I have bought it there many times since I don't use imitation vanilla extract.  Just read the labels carefully, they are at least $5-6 more per bottle than the imitation ones. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oh dear lord!  It's not like your giving the baby a shot of alcohol or a bottle full.  You are rubbing a very small amount on gums.  I did this with my son, and my parents did this with me.  We have all turned out just fine - no alcoholics or long lasting ill-health effects from it.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Never heard of using it for teething.  It's probably the alcohol in the vanilla that does the trick.  Try using some whiskey instead.  Pure vanilla is hard to find.  I used to go to Mexico to buy it.  It was $2 for a huge jar of it.  Comes in clear as well.  I don't have a freaken passport, so I can't go anymore.|`|AA10928232	any grocery store or gourmet kitchen store carries it.

Most "tinctures" and "extracts" use alcohol as the dissolving agent. As far as where to buy that kind... you need to try your local health foods store, or section in the supermarket if you have one.<br>  <br>  If you want to help your teething baby, this works THE BEST: get 4-6 little tiny soft baby washcloths, and make sure they are washed and clean -- no bleach, please, and thoroughly rinsed during the washing cycle. Take the clean dry washcloths, pinch them in the middle and pull them up into a little "ghost" shape. Dip the "point" into fruit juice (apple or grape is usually really good), but leave the bottom of the "ghost" (the edges of the washcloth) undipped. Put them into the freezer and let them freeze.<br>  <br>  Now, when Junior Gerber needs something to chew, pull out one of these little babies. She'll be able to hold onto the washcloth by the undipped part, which will heat up to room temp almost immediately because there's no frozen stuff on it. BUT, the other end of the washcloth has this yummy cold stuff on it that she'll love to chew on!

Fancy/exotic looking ones are all about showing off if they don't also taste great.  Giving great tasting food sends the message that it about making the guest welcome and ensuring they have a good time.  Just my opinion.  Remember - weddings are about sharing the committment of your marraige with people you love. More and more it is about the "wedding" and putting on a good show for people which isn't really the point.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I would say stick to waht everybody knows. For my wedding we just had Chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, green beans and stuffing. Everyone raved about the food- even my dad who tried endlessly to get me to change our menu saying it would be the proverbial wedding "rubber chicken" that everyone hates. He admitted he was wrong. My cousin then served the exact same thing at HER wedding reception (held at the same hotel) three months later 'cause she liked it so much!<br>  <br>  At mine, we also had pizzas brought out around 10:30 pm for people to snack on after drinking and dancing. That was a hit too. My dad also opposed this idea, then afterwards he said that it was the neatest idea.<br>  <br>  Server what everybody knows- it's the easiest way to make guests feel comfortable rather than out-of-place because they don't know what a food is or how to eat it.|`|VcrDOsFKaa	simple it is!!!!!!

You think I’m kidding? There are actually different breeds of chickens (just like how there are different breeds of dogs) that lay different colored eggs. The most common breeds of chickens used for egg-laying are the White Leghorn, the Rhode Island Red, and the New Hampshire. White Leghorn chickens are white and lay white eggs. Rhode Island Red and New Hampshire chickens are reddish brown and lay brown or brown-speckled eggs. <br>  <br>  Actually, both kinds of eggs start off white. But in the Rhode Island Red and New Hampshire chickens, there is an extra layer of brown coloring on top of the white egg, making it look brown.

90bd180dca4e1b8c9c893b718ef0c7f1aa	Hi !!!<br>  Here is a suggestion from a website...it states that you should lessen the amount of Baking Soda just a bit...<br>  <br>  Baking Soda or Baking Powder ?<br>  <br>  Baking powder is alkaline and needs to be mixed with acidic ingredients in order to react. Baking powder is baking soda with an added acidic ingredient, usually cream of tartar. In cookies, baking soda tends to make them spread out more and baking powder tends to make them rise and become puffy or more cake-like. If your recipe calls for baking soda, simply try to reduce it a bit.<br>  <br>  ------------THIS INFORMATION FROM A WEBSITE MIGHT ALSO BE OF INTEREST TO YOU...<br>  <br>  Flat Cookies<br>  <br>  Who wants a cookie that looks more like a pancake? Cookies turning out flat are one of the most common baking problems. Flat cookies aren’t as appetizing in appearance, and they aren’t nearly as good, especially chocolate chip cookies. Chocolate chip cookies are supposed to be thick and chewy, not flat and lumpy. <br>  <br>  If your cookies are turning out flat, make sure your cookie sheets are cool before you place dough on them. If the cookie sheets are warm, the dough will immediately start to melt and spread out. <br>  <br>  If your cookie dough contains butter, try chilling the dough before baking. A warm kitchen is sometimes enough to make the dough too soft. If necessary, while the cookies are baking, place the dough in the refrigerator to keep it well chilled. <br>  <br>  Also, if your recipe calls for butter or margarine, don’t use margarine that comes in a tub. A recipe that calls for softened margarine or butter is referring to butter or margarine that has softened on the kitchen counter, not soft spreadable margarine. Spreadable margarine has a high water content, and if you use spreadable margarine, your cookies will most certainly turn out flat. Use margarine that comes in stick form that is labeled for baking purposes, or use genuine butter. <br>  <br>  Don’t settle for flat unappetizing cookies. Try the tips and suggestions listed here, and chances are your previously flat cookies will turn out thick, chewy, and delicious.|`|xI9n5GfJaa	maybe you add to much margarine or butter..please try to decrease the butter or margarine...or try to add more medium flour until the dough not to soft..

It is a blend of several black teas: most often Assam teas and, less often, other types of black tea.

Wendell, Harney & Sons, and Upton Tea Imports. All of these and many other companies create their own blends of Irish Breakfast tea.<br>  <br>  In Ireland, it is not referred to as "Irish Breakfast tea", but simply as "tea". It is enjoyed throughout the day and evening. The Irish brands, such as Lyons and Barry's, are heavily weighted toward Assam.<br>  <br>  Most commonly, Irish Breakfast tea is drunk with milk, but some prefer to drink it straight or with lemon.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  black tea blend usually described as full-bodied, robust, and/or rich, and blended to go well with milk and sugar, in a style traditionally associated with a hearty English breakfast.

What are some things I can ...    But, number 1 question is WHY THE HECK would you want to eat bacon if you don't really like it?!?!?!    Its terrible for you.    People eat it b/c they LOVE it.    Why would you eat it if you just need to stomach it?|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Put it in a cesar or broccoli salad. The other thing that I like to do with bacon is slice potatoes into thin slices and cook them in a pan with a bit of oil and water, chopped up bacon, chives, and seasoning salt. When the potatoes start to get soft, I boil off the water and oil, and then add 1/2 cup of velveeta cheese. It's probably the most unhealthy, tastiest thing that you can do with potatoes. Oh, or if you have ever had perogies, they taste really good with bacon, cheese, and potatoes in them.

It seems that you are somehow saying that you dislike bacon though.  It has a pretty powerful flavor, so I doubt you can mix it with things and not have them still taste bacon-ey.

But with the crumble topping call it a cobbler crumble.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Cobbler: The fruit filling is put in a deep baking dish and topped with a biscuit dough. The dough may completely cover the fruit or it may just be dropped in handfuls. Either way, a cobbler is baked.     Betty: This baked dessert dates back to the colonial times. The most common Betty is the Apple Brown Betty which is made with brown sugar. A Betty also calls for buttered bread crumbs.     Buckle: This baked dessert dates back to the colonial times. The most common Betty is the Apple Brown Betty which is made with brown sugar. A Betty also calls for buttered bread crumbs.     Crisp: In this baked dessert, the fruit filling is covered with a crunchy topping which is crumbled over the top.     Crumble: Similar to the Crisp, the topping is crumbled over the fruit filling in the pan. A Crumble is baked.     Grunt: A Grunt is a stewed or baked fruit dish. The biscuit dough is rolled and put on top of the fruit. Grunts are also known as Slumps.     Pandowdy: You'll find both spellings in this baked dish. The dough is on top of the fruit and although it is rolled out, it ends up being crumbly.     Clafouti: This is a dessert that originated in the French countryside. It is a dessert that the fruit is topped with either a cake or pudding topping. The Clafouti is often considered a baked pudding.     I'd say it's a Clafouti.|`|W2XyyqSAaa	whatever fruit that's on the bottom, then call it like  Cherry Crumble Cake|`|bqehqlFHaa	Whatever kind of fruit....upside down crumble cake  Like, apple upside down crumble cake!!|`|61f03830cdf19350bd8ba12e0328877caa	Hmmm...

Typically, a recipe will be called a crumble if it has a more textured, crumbly surface.

Eb3SnljMaa	well first things to those who said fast food and mcdonalds would be out. umm lets see if people are poor/low income they cannot AFFORD fast food so thats out ..     KS you are about as ignorant as they come...to say they eat brownish crap because thats all they can aford..and then laff about it. ( you just never know where you will be a month from now or a year from now with todays economy).    and jantas, not all poor people steal or look for handouts....many do for themselves and would rather die before even asking for help.        low income people are less fortunate then others yes, but that does not make them bad people by any means...they may need a little extra helping hand yes..but now look at the world today pay the freakin attention to the news in how many people are losing their jobs every single day, that can be you some damn day. even for those retired have been known to be poor and low income and eating less and not as good quality....      the lower income people can still eat    mac n cheese  hot dogs   burgers  tuna  chicken  rice  pasta  cheese  bread  lunch meat  veggies  fruit  dried beans   lentil  peanut buttter  pastas  soup  grits  oatmeal  cereal    and plenty more of what they can get and may like    there are food pantries that can help people out as well, so they are not without.        as far a middle class...hell all of the above and then some    perhaps able to add more meat and pork to their eating habbits..      the rich of course who have nothing to worry about (yet) can eat all the above and even more...they feel because they have money they can just blow it however when ever...they eat the same stuff and just pay higher prices for what is supposedly better qualities..then they get all that other crap that some people cant even pronounce...and who is to say taht a movie star or a super rich person cant crave a pbj late at nite with a glass of milk??     while money can get you more it does NOT make you a better person. it is you and your pesonality that does that. you can not have a dime to your name and be better then the asshole with a $1000 in his pocket.      in just being here on yahoo for a few days I have noted a few people and how they represent themselves, some I think would be ok to meet and there is some that I think would suck to meet as they give the air about them that they are better than everyone else and that their **** dont stink. its sad, to see how these people put strangers down, while I may be a little sarcastic at times I would never blanantly be mean.|`|XHnpraaxaa	The poor eats whatever they can get there hands on.  Some eat in a soup kitchen and some steal from the store and others look for handouts.      The rich eat whatever their fancy is and the middle class eat whatever is on sale.|`|zawmsUO1aa	McDonald's|`|kkAHzrVFaa	In the southern section of the United States, the poor people eat black eye peas, pinto beans and other dry beans that are a cheap, nutritious source of protein and are easy to prepare and keep.  Many will also eat a lot of the box type generic macaroni and cheese because it is filling.  Poor people eat most of their vegetables from cans because those are cheaper than fresh or frozen and don't require any refrigeration.  Rich and middle class will eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.  The rich will eat more beef and pork, while the middle class eat more chicken  as protein sources.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Lower socioeconomic groups in the US consume a lot of fast food and also cheap foods from the grocery store - highly processed and low nutrient containing items. It is part of the reason that even though we are in a recession, obesity rates are expected to keep rising. If you want examples: check out what is on sale for very cheap in a grocery store ad. You'll see things like bologna, hot dogs, velveeta, white bread, fruit punch...you get the idea. Healthier options that are on sale are: beans, rice and lower grade tuna. Unfortunately, produce is not as cheap and its not included to the extent that it should be. Coupons are almost always for refined foods and that contributes to this problem.     Also, did you ever notice that in poorer neighborhoods in cities, there are way more fast food restaurants that there are in affluent areas? This is not a coincidence. Fast food is borderline predatory in its location planning.     People with more money can eat whatever they want. Dining out in more upscale restaurants and buying a higher percentage of organic goods & produce is common because they can affford it.    Middle class folks are usually in between.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	In Spain there is a dish called "pobre patatas". Translates to "poor mans potatoes".

If they have the money to shop, they buy what's on sale or discounted.  Frozen dinners are usually pretty cheap.  If they get handouts from a food pantry or other people, they will usually get whatever they can stretch the farthest, like rice or pasta.  With most stores carrying generic brands of canned goods, those can be mixed in to make a dish go even further.|`|zxhCy80eaa	Ramen noodles are like 20 for a dollar. We're not poor and I still love the stuff (pregnancy cravings.) I guess a pot of beans, mac and cheese, rice, oatmeal, dollar menus from fast food joints are cheap options. Although a thrifty person would probably know how to shop for some cheap healthy meals like hitting buying some cheap meat and  the local farmer's market for cheap veggies and fruit.   Then again I guess a lot has to do with culture as well. My husband's family is Hispanic and the food is a lot different. I think my husband would be happy just eating fried potatoes, and eggs with tortillas everyday if that's all I cooked.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Poor:  white bread  american cheese  ramen noodles/mac&cheese  ground beef  canned tuna  fast food  kool aid  potato chips  bologna  chef boyardee  hot dogs    They eat these things because they are convenient and cheap and sanitary.

They are durable, easy to clean and you don't have to worry about the coating coming off, plus you can put them in the oven too.  I have 3 of them and I love them and use them more then any other pan I own.  I have seen them at the walmart around me and any store that sells stuff for the kitchen should have them.

LGidAYDwaa	I realize you were told not to put it in the fridge, but it sounds like the fondant is melting as it is.  The reason you don't put the cake in the fridge is so that when you take it out again to serve it, the fondant won't sweat and melt. But that is what's going on right now. If the method I mention below does not work, it's best to call the place you got the cake and they can advise you what is best to do (I hope!).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.baking911.com/decorating/cakes_fondant.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.baking911.com/decorating/cake...</a>  scroll down to "storage".  It says that the reason you usually do not store a fondant cake in the fridge is because of the fillings and frostings underneath the fondant - plus it could dry out the cake and some decorations don't take well to refrigeration. But the place you store it must be a cool, *dry* place. You're having problems with humidity in your room. The "cure" for that is to use an electric fan to blow air onto the cake, rotating it often.  They say it should take about an hour to get the cake in better condition.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

PxJXJKCpaa	Italy  /??t?li/ (help·info) (Italian: Italia), officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana), is located on the Italian Peninsula in Southern Europe and on the two largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea, Sicily and Sardinia. Italy shares its northern, Alpine boundary with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. The independent states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within the Italian Peninsula, and Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.<br>  <br>  Italy has been the home of many European cultures, such as the Etruscans and the Romans, and later was the birthplace of the university and of the Renaissance, that began in Tuscany and spread all over Europe. Italy's capital, Rome, was for centuries the center of Western civilization; it also spawned the Baroque movement and Rome is still the episcopal see of pope. Italy possessed a colonial empire from the second half of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century.<br>  <br>  Today, Italy is a democratic republic and a developed country with the 8th-highest quality-of-life index rating in the world.[4] It is a founding member of what is now the European Union, having signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It is a member of the G8, having the world's 7th-largest nominal GDP, and is also a member state of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Council of Europe, the Western European Union, and the Central European Initiative. Italy is a Schengen state. It has the world's 7th-largest defence budget and shares NATO's nuclear weapons. On 1 January 2007, Italy began a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.<br>  <br>  The modern Italian cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political changes, with its roots reaching back to the 4th century BC. Significant change occurred with the discovery of the New World, when vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, and maize became available. However, these central ingredients of modern Italian cuisine were not introduced in scale before the 18th century.[42]<br>  <br>  Ingredients and dishes vary by region. However, many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the country. Cheese and wine are major parts of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and Denominazione di origine controllata (regulated appellation) laws. Coffee, and more specifically espresso, has become highly important to the cultural cuisine of Italy.<br>  <br>  All from Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  From me:  American food is not traditional in any way.  Since everyone except Native American Indians came here from other countries, everything they used to make in the mother land has been "dumbed down" to American versions.  Italy does not make pizza with ham and pineapple.<br>  <br>  My husband is a pure bred Pollock, my step mother is a pure bred Norwegian and I'm a mutt.  I am Italian, English, Scottish and Swedish.  My daughter has Choctaw in her from her father.  Stick with the Italian cuisine.  It's better in my opinion.|`|AVUbX5IMaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterrane...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cui...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Italian_dishes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ita...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-American_cuisine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-Ame...</a><br>  <br>  I'm Italian, if you have any questions send me an e-mail and I'll try to help you|`|IU3JAWHsaa	italian salad, mix vegetables, nuts, olives, then put some fresh pieces of garlic, black pepper, olive oil, then done, it looks and taste delicious
doz7RIoeaa	Just wondering why you have to tell people you are vegetarian. Maybe they are doing it on  purpose because they find YOU annoying. "Oh here she comes, miss high and  mighty Miss Vegetarian".. Not saying they are right but it could that's how they see you.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to a degree they are right, it is not "normal". Since about 97% of the population eat some sort of meat or meat product, the other 3% can be considered "weird" in that context. Don't bother arguing back. Just say something like" Oh ok thanks, I'll think about it.." No point getting upset over nothing and no point getting into an argument where both sides aren't likely to change their minds. And if you still cannot stand being around these people. get new friends,|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Because people are ignorant. Protein is found in most foods, and the average person eats more protein than they can digest. Iron is found in whole grains, beans, nuts, some vegetables, and other places. Tell them this and hopefully those annoying people will shaddup. Don't let them get to you too much.|`|2RzEaod9aa	I'm a vegan and I'm into bodybuilding. Get into a hobby like that and you get made fun of less because they can see your muscles and know you can kick their meat-eating a$$es. <br>  <br>  When someone asks me how I get protein, I ask them if they know where the f*ck they can find their macronutrients. They usually don't even know what a macronutrient is. If you don't know your three macros, then you have no business trying to tell me that I'm going to be deficient.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I guess they just don't fully understand your choice.  I don't think it's weird to be vegan (requires a lot of willpower!) and it can be a very healthy diet if done properly (replacing the meat with something else).|`|B365rHNAaa	well stop telling people that your a vegetarian then|`|b9uOax0aaa	Perhaps you should analyze how and why you tell people that you are vege.|`|79fcac6e0406e4474b56ccb8bbacad81aa	Because people don't like to contemplate things. Rather than thinking to themselves "Maybe that girl has a point. Maybe she has good reasons to be vegetarian.", they think of all the negative things they can possibly think of. The obnoxious thing is that they're wrong about vegetarians having any deficiencies. It's just not true. Try calmly explaining your philosophies, if they'll listen. If not just remember why you are the person you are and be proud of yourself.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	i dont find it unhealthy, because you can gain protein and such in other ways, however people who are vegetarians generally Look unhealthy and underweight..  i dont understand why strangers would bother you about it, but i can understand how people you have known for a long time wouldn't get it.  if my friend of 13 years told me she is now a vegetarian, i would probably ask her why?, because it's a drastic change in lifestyle.. i mean, we couldnt share a pizza anymore!  lol  good luck!|`|AA11552865	Hmm. Depends where your from. Like if you live somewhere thats very cultured to eat meat. Im from a real small town and although theres not that many veggies where i live it doesnt seem that weird.<br>  I became a veggie when i was in my last year at highschool and my friends said similar things when it was lunchtime. It is kinda annoying but if its something you wanna do then do it. too many peta videos made me veggie and i feel alot happier now i dont eat animals :)<br>  <br>  I dont care if people call us weird. Weird is soooo much more interesting than 'normal'<br>  -peace.|`|BjS8k8Cyaa	Those people are so darn stupid.

We'll show them!|`|tbzVUKcyaa	its called ignorance. i started when i was 8 and i am perfectly healthy. if you feel you need vitamin supplements take them but with a balanced diet then you will be fine. you must eat soya tofu or quorn to help with protein but a balance is good.<br>  dont worry about it, it can be annoying but would it be more difficult for you to eat meat and be unhappy or not eat it and have a few people moan.|`|e319dd7fc367cb467844fd4db759150caa	Well all I can say is to get used to it, but, when they ask you that this is an opportunity to explain yourself. They are probably curious and uninformed about the subject, so give them an idea of why you are and they wont ask you again. If they persist and say 'that's stupid', just ignore them. The animals still thank you|`|9WR2lKBtaa	It's only unhealthy if you're not taking in all the essential amino acids for your body to make proteins. Tell them that you don't have to eat meat to get your protein, but rather a variety of veggies...<br>  <br>  If it keeps up just ignore them and it'll eventually pass.|`|2Av3gIqgaa	I think that some people are afraid of change.  Even though the evidence is there that it is more healthy to avoid meat, people think that you have to have it.  A lot of people are uneducated about vegetarianism or are afraid of it or whatever.  It doesn't matter though.  Just keep doing what you are doing.  I'm a veggie because I think meat is gross.  Its the same reason I don't eat fruit.  I just don't like it and everytime the subject comes up I hear "how can you possibly not like fruit??"<br>  <br>   Just kindly say, "I don't question your motives when you want to order a big steak, do I?"  Tell them you take an iron supplement and B12 vitamins so you're getting all of the nutrition you need.  And leave it at that.  If they continue, just ignore it.<br>  <br>  Also, you're new to being a vegetarian, so eventually the asinine comments will subside and you can eat your vegetables in peace.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  :)|`|cE6stGJEaa	i recntly became a vegetarien myself 5 months ago. Except I am a little more strict on the foods i eat than other vegetariens like not eating things with gelatin in them etc. People that to me all the time and ask  "so why did you become a vegatarien?" and i cant really explain it to them because its like they would never understand. I dont know why people are so annoying about it, i guess they are just interested or are trying to make you go back. i think every vegetarien gets asked the same questions. i think all the annoying questions would get worse if you were a vegan.|`|13df26b401e9deed46293d0263ceb167aa	I wonder if they're just not accepting your decision yet because it is something that is new to you.

A nice little trick is to mix a little pinch of baking soda in with your toothpaste.

21a437ee35c55754a09c8056ed529cb1aa	I read your recipe and no, you cannot substitute milk and flour.  For that matter, milk and flour is a terrible substitute since in all likelihood you will have lumps.  I assume you're concerned about the fat level of the cream?  It's only 1 cup for a whole recipe but nevertheless, you'd be better off just keeping it out of the dish rather than replacing it with something that will ruin the dish.<br>  <br>  Your sister's milk and flour idea hints toward a roux, a mixture of fat and flour, (usually butter and oil).  On my website is an article for making roux.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foodforthoughtonline.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodforthoughtonline.net/</a><br>  <br>  ______________________________________...|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	I checked out the recipe. you can make a roux of butter and flour then slowly stir in the milk to get the desired consistency. It will not taste as rich but should be satisfactory. It won't be runny. Just be careful not to burn the flour, use a medium low heat until you get it emulsified, then turn up the heat a bit to get it thickened. Thanks for the website. Good luck!|`|5cvPPWjEaa	no you can't because it will not give a good taste to your dish|`|217c8796b5373a65275202f935b6fcdbaa	Also..<br>  <br>  If you have a can of condensed milk, give it a try!      If you do use milk and flour, make sure you whisk it really well !<br>  <br>  Good luck!

hwZMijykaa	Eggplant can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. However, it is important to keep eggplant away from fruits or vegetables that produce ethylene, such as apples and apricots. These items will speed up the ripening process. <br>  <br>  Vegetables such as winter squash, garlic, potato, and taro tend to keep well even when stored at room temperature, but most vegetables need to be refrigerated or frozen upon purchase. Though vegetables are stored differently depending on their specific characteristics, a few general rules apply.<br>  <br>  <br>  ****If you want them to store in Fridge then,<br>  <br>  The vegetable compartment of the refrigerator is the best place to keep perishable vegetables, as it’s warmer and more humid than the upper shelves, where the drier air causes them to dry out. For this reason, vegetables stored on refrigerator shelves should always be wrapped in plastic bags.<br>  <br>  ****you can keep them in freezer too:-<br>  <br>  Most vegetables stand up well to freezing, which makes it possible to consume seasonal vegetables throughout the year. When properly done, freezing preserves the color, texture, flavor, and most of the nutritional value of vegetables. For best results, follow these guidelines:<br>  <br>  *Blanching: Though freezing slows down the activity of the enzymes responsible for unpleasant odors and for the loss of color and nutrients in vegetables, it does not neutralize the effect of the enzymes completely. These enzymes can be neutralized only if the vegetables are blanched before being frozen. The nutritional value of a vegetable that has been properly blanched and frozen will be comparable to that of a fresh vegetable. Only vegetables with a high acid content, such as tomatoes, do not need to be blanched prior to freezing. <br>  <br>  *Ripeness: Only freeze vegetables that are fresh and in good condition, and that reach peak ripeness soon after harvesting or purchasing. Before being frozen, unripe vegetables should be stored in the refrigerator until ripe.|`|96eb22f6ee03cc767154af977c438078aa	When they start to get soft and mushy they are starting to go bad. Brown spots are also an indicator on some of these. You can cook the eggplant (bread and fry it) then freeze it for up to 2 months. The lettuce will stay for a fair while if you put it in an airtight container. Tomatoes will last about 10 days. The bananas will turn brown and mushy and then they are overripe.. But some people like them that way. Mushrooms will stay for a bit. They are going bad when they start getting fuzzy and brown..|`|EEqedh7Daa	9 days

FsimZiaXaa	keep em in the water for about 7-10 minutes.  Drain the water and let the eggs sit in their own heat till they cool.|`|PCYjmAX7aa	Hi everyone.  I'm a really good cook who has lots of fundraiser and other type of family parties.  Often recipes call for hard boiled eggs and with cooking for as many as 80 people at one time, I GAVE UP TOTALLY on cooking hard boiled eggs in the shell.  You can die of old age prior to getting them all pealed, and if the eggs are not totally fresh or cooked perfect as far as putting them in the water [hot or cold] taking them out at the right time, hard to judge at times, OR when to take the shells off.  What I NOW DO is use a HUGE pot, get the water really boiling, and I crack the egg directly in the boiling water that has now been turned down where it is still slightly bubbling but not boiling.  You have ZERO eggs to peal, and if you take one out early and it's not quite done, put it back in.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I put them in the pan and cover with cold water.  Then I bring to a boil, remove from the heat, cover the pan and let sit for 7-10 minutes.  Then drain off the water, shake the pan gently to crack the shells, and cover them with cold water. They're always perfect, easy to peel and never have the gray ring.  The time depends on the size of the eggs and the size of the pan.  I use a large pot for a dozen eggs and I use large eggs.|`|ygxM1Zkaaa	i put them in a pot and then fill the pot with water and wait for the water to come to a boil then i time it for 7 minutes and then turn off the burner and let them sit in the water until it gets room temp and they are perfect.|`|f63d45d3d5210c3943461f9d33b2055caa	being a chef....here it is follow:  put eggs in pan with cold water..put on stove and turn on...when the water just starts boiling put a timer on for 6-7 minutes...take off the stove remove the hot water and put lots of ice on top of them...they will be real good and easy to peel...let me know sue:)|`|qsXR5GRBaa	The key to hard boiled eggs is to start them in boiling water, boil for 13 minutes, and let cool under running cold water.  When you use this method, they are perfectly done and are very easy to peel.|`|VhHVjMe8aa	I boil them for 5 min. then cover the pan and take it off the heat, let it set for 30 min. the run cold water over the eggs.

Once at a rolling boil, remove the pan from the heat and cover with a lid.

Canned tuna in caught& canned so there is no lose of nutrition|`|sG5FKmAYaa	They contain preservatives and the canning process cooks them.<br>  <br>  You have to remember the actual purpose of the canning process, and that was to make food last, back in the days without domestic refrigeration. That was before the 'health" aspect kicked in.<br>  <br>  Frozen foods are now packed and processed so fast that often they are better than fresh products.<br>  <br>  Fresh products (particularly in the US) have to travel 100's - 1,000's of mile to get to you and are handled numerous times.|`|AA11394457	I won't say it's bad, but certainly is better to have the fresh stuff. Due to the high temperatures used during the canning process, the food gets cooked or partially cooked, losing part of it vitamins content.  Also in order to preserve the food for a long time, it's kept in acidulated water or brine, which alters the flavour of the food significantly.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Some of the vitamins are destroyed by the canning process, which heats foods to over 400 degrees F.  Most canneries add preservatives such as salt and citric acid.  So no, canned food is not as healthy as fresh food.  Also, the texture is destroyed.  Canned peas bear no resemblance whatsoever to fresh ones, and canned tuna bears no resemblance to fresh either.  Imagine a canned-tuna sushi--yuck!<br>  <br>  The advantage to canned food is that it retains some of its flavor, some of the vitamins, and all of the caloric value.  And it needs no refrigeration, keeps in that state for years.  And canned vegetables are processed when the crops come in--which is more efficient and therefore (usually) cheaper.<br>  <br>  My favorite canned vegetable is the tomato--canned tomatoes can make excellent pasta sauces and are available year round.  The fresh tomatoes available in supermarkets during the winter are vastly overpriced, flavorless, and do not make good sauces.|`|v0596BTeaa	Most canned foods do not contain preservatives - and you can get canned food with no salt or sugar, read the ingredients on the can.  Lots of people insist fresh is best, but, if you take carrots, peas etc. then how fresh are fresh ones?   They are probably days or weeks old before you get them, unless you are lucky enough to have easy access to a farmers' market, and only buy seasonal, local vegetables.  Canned peas are usually picked and canned within hours, and, although they do lose some nutrients in the canning process, are generally of a similar quality to fresh, cooked food.<br>  Same with tuna, sardines etc.  They are processed and canned very soon after catching.  'Fresh' fish is often not quite so fresh and will have passed through many hands on its way to you.  Canned and frozen foods are also convenient.  Canned beans particularly, as dried pulses have to be soaked and then cooked for a long time before they can be eaten safely.  My personal preference is fresh, but canned food does have a lot going for it.  I know this is a long answer, sorry, but some of the previous posters were perpetuating myths that are simply not true.|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Don't be in too much of a hurry to knock canned food.

doz7RIoeaa	Go to a better restaurant.. what kind of cheap restaurants do you go to that the wait staff cannot tell you the ingredients in the food,,,  and it's kind obvious isn't it? Egg based and dairy/cheese dressings are obviously "not vegan". And depending on your own preferences, a honey vinaigrette may not be acceptable to you either,. You can order a salad "dry" then ask for vinegar/oil and other ingredients you prefer and dress your own salad if the restaurant allows it, <br>  <br>  Though you vegans are more aware of what goes into your food and food n general.  Especially with a name like yours. I would have thought you knew better..Sounds like you are all about anti meat PETA propaganda and not enough common sense.<br>  <br>  Contrary to another post, a  lot of vinaigrettes may contain any of the following: anchovies/ anchovy paste, egg yolk, duck fat, goose fat, bacon/fat, butter, beef bone marrow, liver and other meats.|`|2RzEaod9aa	If they don't know, then just ask for some balsamic vinegar. Red wine vinagrette is usually not vegan, FYI.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and the person from me is the most correct, it is not easy as some places may use bottle or bought dressings, and even for those places were the wait staff do actually know what go in the dishes it is not going to be easy, and in most cases as previously stated, most have an ingredient that most vegans will not consume.<br>  <br>  So it may come down to an oil and vinegar choice, ask for a cruet set with the oil and vinegar so you can add to your liking, a vegetarian or vegan restaurant may have more of the choice you would be apt to use, but dairy as in yogurt is quite popular in some vegetarian places, herbal dressing can be the best but be very careful, some have not vegan ingredients in them like stabilizers, gum thickeners and on rare occasions anchovies or other fish products.|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	Too much oil and fat are very bad for your health regardless of whether its an animal or vegetable source. You only need about a tablespoon of oil each day... More than that is too much.<br>  <br>  I'd order a salad and ask for vinegar only.|`|nvH62xo5aa	ask the waiter about the ingredients. he or she probably will not know, but if they think you have some sort of deathly allergy *wink* *wink*, they will go back and check.|`|AA11296044	Ask for balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br>  <br>  Vinegrettes are usually vegan.|`|Z2cbezZDaa	Chose a different restaurant. No, really. If a waiter doesn't know, and doesn't volunteer to find out from the chef, then I wouldn't want to eat there. But then I'm gluten-intolerant as well as vegan, so want that extra bit of reassurance.
VhHVjMe8aa	Set oven to 325. Season meat with salt, pepper, or what ever you like and place it in a roasting pan fat side up. Put about a cup of water in the pan. You can put potatoes and carrots and onions in too if you like. Cover it with foil or a lid and bake it 45 min. for every pound.|`|R8Hm0dFAaa	Mario Batali has a great recipe for garlic-braised pork butt that I made a few months back. My friend said "just google 'Mario Batali pork butt' and you'll find it". And I did. But I just tried googling that, and the recipe no longer comes up.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the recipe involved removing most of the fat from the outside of the pork butt, then coating it with a mixture of mostly crushed garlic, combined with, I think, some olive oil and salt, then slow cooking it in the oven in a covered pot for about 8 hours, probably at around 250 degrees.<br>  <br>  I did find a similar Mario Batali recipe on Esquire.com. That recipe (see link below) actually calls for butterflied pork shoulder, and some additional seasonings, but you could do it with a pork butt, I bet.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Sure you can! toss the thing in the crock, add the syrup from one 2 cup size can of peaches with 2 teaspoons ginger stirrred into it and sufficient water to prevent sticking. I like pearl onions, green beans and celery with this.

7utsLRfyaa	you can make chocolate chips by buying a bar of chocolate, putting it in a bag and smack it a lot with a rolling pin - it works wonders - trust me :D|`|AA12156890	Cooking Tips<br>  Chocolate Chips retain their shape when "melted".<br>  <br>  Some food writers advise not to swap Chocolate Chips in for recipes that call for regular cooking chocolate to be melted, as the chips were meant to hold their shape, and when you force them to melt beyond that the chocolate becomes grainy and hard to work with. They neglect the minor fact, however, that there are a zillion recipes that call for you to melt Chocolate Chips. In fact, most people who've blithely done it haven't come across any life-changing challenges in doing so. To melt, melt over a double-boiler or (easier, less fuss) in a microwave. They melt more easily if you put in with them some of a liquid that your recipe calls for, such as milk or syrup.<br>  <br>  Substitutes<br>  Carob chips; chopped cooking chocolate.<br>  <br>  Equivalents<br>  1 cup = 6 oz by weight = 175g<br>  <br>  Storage<br>  Store in a sealed container for up to 4 months.|`|ZuENZiB0aa	you could make the chocolate chips yourself by buying cooking chocolate and crushing it. you could also get the chocolate chips from a good store. i have lots of them in my fridge cause my mom loves to make desserts and cookies! you could try some good store like dorabjees. they would surely have it! <br>  <br>  it is better to buy them because you won't get the same taste if you crush chocolate|`|hFnUAImYaa	hi friend,<br>  u can just follow the steps given below for easy make,<br>  1.buy some chocolates llike coffee bite or something u love(big one)<br>  2.cut them like chips that is like small pieces.<br>  3.and if u want u can pour milk on it or just put it in a bowl and eat.<br>  really it is so tasty and delicious.<br>  i like it.<br>  thats it.

If you own a cat, you'll have the added con of fighting for the ownership of your sushi. And like anything else, although it is supposed to be a health food, the commercial versions are loaded with added fats and things that are bad for your. And, they do have a lot of calories.

JeE9omqzaa	Wasabi (Japanese: わさび,ワサビ , 山葵 (originally written 和佐比); Wasabia japonica , Cochlearia wasabi, or Eutrema japonica) is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes cabbages, horseradish and mustard. Known as "Japanese horseradish", its root is used as a spice and has an extremely strong flavour. Its hotness is more akin to that of a hot mustard than the capsaicin in a chili pepper, producing vapors that irritate the nasal passages more than the tongue. The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan. There are also other species used, such as W. koreana, and W. tetsuigi. The two main cultivars in the marketplace are W. japonica cv. 'Daruma' and cv. 'Mazuma', but there are many others.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Known as "Japanese horseradish", its root is used as a spice and has an extremely strong flavour.

53giV6PFaa	Papo de anjo ("angel's double chin") is a traditional Portuguese and Brazilian dessert made chiefly from whipped egg yolks, baked and then boiled in sugar syrup.<br>  <br>  Like fios de ovos and several other classical Portuguese sweets based on egg yolks, papo de anjo is believed to have been created by monks and nuns around the 14th century. Laundry was a common service performed by convents and monasteries, and their use of egg whites for "starching" clothes created a large surplus of yolks.<br>  <br>  According to most recipes, the yolks must be whipped until they swell to double their original volume. Some recipes also call for egg whites (1--2 whites for each 10 yolks), beaten separately to "firm snow" consistency and gently mixed into the yolks. The mixture is then poured into greased muffin forms (about 1/2 tablespoon each) and baked until they are firm but still without crust. The pieces are then boiled lightly in the syrup, which may be flavored with rum, vanilla, or orange peel.<br>  <br>   Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method<br>   --------  ------------  --------------------------------<br>      7                    yolks<br>      2                    egg whites<br>      1      tbsp          flour<br>                           butter<br>                           Syrup<br>      4      c             sugar<br>      3      c             water<br>      1                    orange peel<br>      2      tbsp          rum<br>   <br>   1.

Use a slotted spoon to remove from pan and set aside.<br>  <br>  2 Add the rice to the pan to brown. Add a little more olive oil if necessary. Stir first to coat the rice with the olive oil in the pan. Then don't stir too much or you will prevent it from browning. Let it brown and then stir a little to let more of it brown. Then add the onion and garlic.

In my research I have found that the darker honeys tend to be better for you. It also depends to some degree how the honey is processed. Apiaries closer to orchards have honey that takes on a fruity flavor of the orchard and have one set of traits while apiaries in fields tend to be a clover or wild flower based honey which has a different taste and different traits.

The fish was consumed, while the rice was discarded. It was then later introduced to Japan, but the Japanese ate the rice with the fish, which was the birth of sushi.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sushi-master.com/usa/whatis/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://sushi-master.com/usa/whatis/histo...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sushi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a><br>  <a href="http://gojapan.about.com/cs/sushilinks1/a/sushi1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gojapan.about.com/cs/sushilinks1/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sushifaq.com/history-of-sushi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sushifaq.com/history-of-sushi...</a>|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Sushi originated from Japan.  It was originally created as a snack food for people heading to the theater, as it was portable and easily eaten with your hand.<br>  <br>  This original style of sushi was a bit different from what most people see in sushi restaurants today.  The sushi was pressed into large square pans, and then cut into individual pieces.  This style of sushi is now referred to as "kyoto sushi" and can still be found mainly around the city of Kyoto, which is also where the Japanese forms of theater (Noh, Kabuki, etc.) originated.<br>  <br>  The sushi most of us are familiar with today is Tokyo style, where the rice is formed into individual pads, before having a slice of fish or some other topping laid on top of it.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia has some information but you'd be better off going to the library and looking up some books.|`|z25aqkDjaa	japan.but their version is very different from the occidental one.the rice,raw fish-seafood and algae are basically the same but they do not have cheese,or avocado on theirs-and  sauces including ketchup or mayo...............|`|LWmudJYHaa	japan|`|AA11907123	Japan (as poster above said, Tokyo i.e. "Edo" style as opposed to Kyoto).<br>  <br>  But Japanese got the idea of eating raw fish from Koreans (originally it was actually pickled, and the bed of rice on which it rested was thrown out.)<br>  <br>  The Wikipedia article on it is good, just try that.|`|JeE9omqzaa	IT IS A JAPANESE ITEM!|`|d8HwFub8aa	japan|`|YkseyT7zaa	Germany, along with bratz|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Japan !!!

People that are a vegetarian for health reasons generally still include fish and chicken in their diet while those who are vegetarians for animal rights generally will eat no meat.<br>  The types of vegetarians are:<br>  Occasional vegetarian: Eats no red meat but includes fish and chicken in diet<br>  Lacto-vegetarian: Eats veggies, nuts, fruits, vegetarian products (ex: tofu) and milk products (no eggs or meat)<br>  Ovo-vegetarian: Eats veggies, nuts, fruits, vegetarian products and eggs (no dairy or meat)<br>  Lacto-ovo vegetarian: Eats veggies, nuts, fruits, vegetarian products (ex: tofu), milk products and eggs. (no meat)<br>  Vegan: Eats veggies, nuts, fruits, vegetarian products (ex: tofu). Eats no meat or animal bi-products.<br>  Some vegans will also nut eat honey or anything that is made from living creatures.<br>  Now that you are a vegetarian you need to read labels closely, to find out if there are products you don't eat in something, depending how serious of a vegetarian you are. For example some cheese contain 'rennet' which is an enzyme taken from the stomach of a calf.

Those are areas where you can buy these foreign "plants." You can also find grains, beans, and nuts on the inner aisles in the store. <br>  <br>  As a vegetarian, you'll still be able to consume dairy and eggs.

Is found in some cheeses but it is really easy to get cheese without rennet. Most places sell it. <br>  <br>  Tallow. Is beef fat. Can also be called suet. <br>  <br>  Anchovies. Little fish and can be found in some sauces, like Worchester sauce. <br>  <br>  Chicken and beef fat and stock. Used to flavor things like seasoned rice and stuffing mixes, vegetable soup.|`|rrWhhiMEaa	Technically a vegetarian would eat NO meat or products that use animal parts such as gelatin, rennet, etc. This includes fish, they are living creatures too. Eggs are also debatable.<br>  <br>  Since there is supposedly no "harm" in milking cows, dairy products are considered vegetarian, but modern farm methods are in no way kind to animals(same goes for the chickens who lay eggs). It depends largely on your reasons for being a veg.<br>  <br>  My opinion? Dont get caught up in labels. Do what feels right for you. If you want to eat a steak once a year do that. If you want to eat fish but not eggs, do that (but watch out for mercury levels).<br>  <br>  To be vegetarian, you should make sure you are eating balanced meals and including TONS of fruits and vegetables. If you like ethnic foods, this will add lots of variety and flavor. Hummus, veg fajitas, Indian food, etc. Eat different varieties of beans and lentils every day.<br>  <br>  Browse veg and vegan food blogs for great recipe ideas.

King Henry VIII insisted that there was always an imitation at his dinner table.<br>  <br>  In the eary 20th century, food was definatly your meat & 3 veg. That changed after WWII to anything that was French. In the late 60's another fad developed, called nouvelle cuisine. Nouvelle cuisine was popular until the late 80's & thank god it's no longer popular. It was very small meals, with very intricate work on every plate. The common joke at the time was "After dinner shal we get KFC?". In the 90's infusion became popular, a comination of eastern & westers style food. A lot of chefs made mistakes chasing infusoin, very difficult to pull off sucessfuly. Today, what's becoming popular is a style of food called molecular gastronomy, basicaly, breaking food down to the molecuar level & then re-building it. Check out places like El Bulli in Spain & the Fat Duck in England, they are the best at that.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	I have noticed this too. Like cupcakes and frozen yogurt is really out there as well.

N53iI8weaa	They're usually as much good as the proverbial chocolate teapot, using all the usual "get-out" clauses they can come up with just to cover themselves. I use a good guide to meat cooking and go buy the finished weight.|`|KWhKwgsSaa	I don't follow the directions on the packs -- they are not accurate.  And, yes, I do cook them like my grandmother did, and my mom and my aunt who were all my cooking teachers -- and those recipes always turn out great.|`|AA11632160	Never, I always do it my own way.|`|AA11394457	Neither, the instructions are always too short on time and the temperature is way too law, and granny's instructions worked well in a time when meat was produced in a more natural manner.  Meat these days is tougher and leaner, so it requires a new whole set of instructions, mainly more time and more heat, and you have to make sure it doesn't dry, as it hasn't internal fat to baste itself.|`|YZxc3SnSaa	I try to cook like my mother & gran used to but cannot get it right! <br>  After all that was what I was brought up on & can never be replicated these days .<br>  <br>  PS where can I buy dripping?|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Neither - I find different recipes online and try them all!!|`|a18866a5fa9b1011516eec55c6df35e4aa	Cook them like my granny used to|`|BTCtT6edaa	I buy my meat from a market stall, it doesn't have packaging and doesn't come with instructions.

YZxc3SnSaa	It's personal preference, each to their own,<br>  If you have cooked all your life you know how to do it the way you like it , but if you're young & lived off ready meals the cooking instructions probably prevents food poisoning.<br>  That said , It is essential that you get the skin "scratching" spot on ,- crisp & salty & only "old heads " know how to perfect that.<br>  <br>  Now I'm salivating ,|`|72b28834a5d287054c4ed11bd8b49e15aa	Yes, definitely.

Then I'm looking for a quick sear to medium.|`|AA11349881	Yes it does,add sage to it,tastes even better|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	Yes thats just the way I like it.Thought I was the only one,nice to know i am not alone in my tastes|`|8BGehWCoaa	Absolutely, long and slow makes it more tender, as long as you keep an eye on it to keep it from drying out.  If you cook it for a shorter time at a higher temperature it tends to brown on the outside more quickly without cooking all the way through on the inside.|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Either longer in the stove with lower heat or in the crock pot (slow cooker) on low for 8 hours or high for 4-5 hours.|`|2GdZSXC1aa	I agree, lower heat is better.

OKPFeBtYaa	Let's see, drinking a bottle of vodka can make you do things like urinate in the middle of the electronics department in walmart, or try to hook up with your brother's wife, or tell the cops to "eat a dick" when they come after you wreck your car.  Coffee makes you pee a lot and a little jittery. So yes, I'd say they're pretty much the same.|`|bAKbAKdzaa	they both make me off the wall?<br>  <br>  i guess the only similarities i see are how they affect me.<br>  <br>  [xoxo]<br>  <br>  jessica mae|`|6b411d8c2b928cab641819a7b415bc26aa	Lol, when you mix them together.  Separate, they are totally different!|`|kBnpDbGAaa	they both have bad and good effects in our health. :]|`|nOVSf06Raa	Coffee is a diuretic and will make you urinate frequently especially if you drink a lot of coffee, in regard of the Vodka if you have a headache it will either make you relaxed and fall asleep and when you wake up your headache will be gone or make you tipsy it all depends on how much you drink of course.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Guess I never noticed before.  Coffee wires me and vodka calms me down.  Neither work for my headaches, tho.  I'd rather drink beer if I had a choice.

k9IppJ6Uaa	Aw, I'm sorry.<br>  and they say women have PMS...<br>  <br>  Well, just forget it and forgive him - it ain't his fault that he is a guy! :D<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~|`|DchAJvVqaa	the only thing i could think is that since he is working all these hours then he is tired so he in turn is cranky, hence the i don't want that ****, and also you really should have put them in a bag...BUT THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE!!!!!!! he should NOT have spoken to you that way.... my boyfriend would have been wearing the burritos to work!!!!|`|KWhKwgsSaa	Poor guy -- working hard, crazy hours, plus night school -- he has a right to be cranky.  You already knew that he doesn't like to eat when he first wakes up, and if you intended for him to take them and eat later, putting them in a bag is logical .... the little plate was illogical.<br>  <br>  Give the poor guy a break, and try not to take everything so personally.  He is probably exhausted -- mentally and physically.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	He was nasty.  Make sure that's the last breakfast you ever make for him until he apologizes.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	lol....my husband did that ONCE.....<br>  <br>  I never made him breakfast or lunch again until he apologized a million times.  I have found that they love it if you make it convient for them to take on the road and eat in the car.  Next time (if there is one) wrap them in foil so he can peel it back and eat it as he drives.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Awww, that sucks.  I hate it when my man is crabby in the morning.  He never eats breakfast at breakfast time, so I don't have to cook early in the morning.  I'm sure he doesn't realize that you did it to be loving.  When he comes home tonight, pretend it didn't happen.  He's just a guy.  They just don't understand us.|`|53giV6PFaa	He felt guilty which is why he called back.  He probably did not sleep well and is a crankpot.  My husband is like that in the mornings sometimes.  I would talk to him when he gets home and let him know how you feel.  It probably would not change him though, but at least he'll know how you felt.|`|AA10928232	He's taking you for granted.  Move out (or kick him out, if it's your place) and make him cough up a ring and a wedding date within 6 months.  If he won't, sound slike your best rid of him and his attitude.
PCa8jwMuaa	English people probably drink more alcohol than any other countries, as they live in such a cold climate and also there are pubs just about everywhere.<br>  <br>  Population of about 61 million in the UK.

Of these people, 43% are classified as regular drinkers, 39% are classified as binge drinkers, and the remaining 18% are classified as occasional drinkers.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.<br>  <br>  PB.|`|7nJnk2OGaa	5%
LVPNuEsLaa	There are several good comments here already on the difference between them, but I will add one more:<br>  <br>  In general, you will drunk faster on champagne than on white wine.  The dissolved gas in the champagne speeds the absorption of the alcohol into the bloodstream, so it hits you faster.  Sugar has a similar effect.<br>  <br>  Note that it does not hit you any harder - the amount of alcohol is roughly the same.  Also note that this is true of carbonation in general - flat champagne is about the same as wine, and a rum and coke will be absorbed faster than a screwdriver (vodka and OJ).|`|satZYrlkaa	Actually Champagne is not carbonated, it undergoes a secondary fermentation in the bottle. It is made by a process known as "Méthode Champagnoise". It is either made from white grapes (blanc de blancs) or red and white grapes (blanc de noirs).<br>  Sparkling wine made outside of the Champagne region is sometimes carbonated and results in a poorer quality end product.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, Champagne is wine and its ABV usually hovers around the 12% mark.<br>  Don't get drunk on Champagne, it is a waste, especially considering the hard work put into the production.|`|yHk0DWeUaa	Actually it is carbonated. That is what gives it the bubbles however it is not artificially carbonated like soda. The carbonation is a byproduct of not secondary fermentation as that is vented out but final fermentation. Just before bottling they add a bit more sugar (per say) so that the little yeasts have a going away present and continue to produce alcohol and CO2 the bi-product of the fermentation process. Different strains of yeast have different alcohol level tolerances so once the alcohol reaches that desired level, they stop metabolizing and or die off.|`|hwZMijykaa	Both are about 12% (or 24 proof) alcohol. So it really doesn't matter which on you drink ... it really has to do with your level of tolerance (to alcohol).|`|m1cEbzBcaa	champagne is a sparkling (carbonated) wine (usually white) from the champagne region in france.<br>  <br>  white wine is not normally carbonated, but otherwise can be similar.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Chris W, it doesn't matter how it becomes carbonated, artificially by adding CO2, or naturally with a secondary fermentation, they both are the same end-results: carbonation.

UDfJQ3i9aa	The Whole Jar of Peanut Butter Cookies --  This cookie got its name because a whole 18-ounce jar of peanut butter is used to make it. It is the creamiest, moistest cookie I have ever had, and bound to be a favorite with anyone who makes them. Just don't over bake them!<br>  <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  1 cup butter, softened <br>  1 cup white sugar <br>  1 cup packed brown sugar <br>  2 egg <br>  1 egg yolk <br>  2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>  1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter <br>  2 cups all-purpose flour <br>  1 teaspoon baking soda <br>  1/2 teaspoon salt <br>  1 cup chopped peanuts <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  In a large bowl, cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, yolks, and vanilla; mix until fluffy. Stir in peanut butter. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Finally, stir in the peanuts. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours. <br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.<br>   <br>  Roll dough into walnut sized balls. Place on the prepared cookie sheet and flatten slightly with a fork. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should look dry on top. Allow to cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to cool completely on a rack. These cookies taste great when slightly undercooked.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	This peanut butter cookie recipe is the easiest and best-tasting I've ever made, plus it takes almost no time at all:<br>  <br>  Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit<br>  <br>  1 cup peanut butter, creamy or chunky<br>  1 cup packed brown sugar, light or dark<br>  1 large egg, slightly beaten<br>  1 teaspoon baking soda<br>  1 cup chocolate chips (I used chocolate & peanut butter chips)<br>  <br>  Beat together the first four ingredients until mixture is smooth and well blended (I just beat them with a spoon).  Stir in chips until evenly distributed. <br>  <br>  Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. <br>  <br>  Bake EXACTLY 10 minutes.  <br>  <br>  Remove from oven, but leave on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes (the cookies will “set up” during this time).<br>  <br>  Remove from cookie sheets and let cool on wire rack.<br>  <br>  Makes about 30 cookies.<br>  <br>  Aside from peanut butter cookies, make a stir fry and add a little peanut butter and soy sauce for a Thai twist.  <br>  <br>  Or, make peanut butter frosting.  With a hand mixer, mix 8 ounces (1/2 cup) each of butter, cream cheese and peanut butter (spray the measuring cup with nonstick spray and the peanut butter comes right out).  When thoroughly mixed, add in 2 tablespoons milk and 1 cup confectioner's (powdered) sugar.  Add more milk if necessary to get frosting consistency.  Refrigerate the cake or whatever you put it on.|`|AA10928232	Big, Super-Nutty Peanut Butter Cookies<br>  <br>  Bringing the butter, peanut butter, and eggs to room temperature makes it easier to blend the ingredients. Be sure to grind the peanuts, since whole, and even chopped peanuts tend to slip out of the dough. If using unsalted butter, increase salt to 1 teaspoon. Keep finished cookies refrigerated in airtight container. To restore just-baked chewiness, wrap a cookie in a sheet of paper towel and microwave for approximately 25 seconds. Cool before serving.<br>  <br>  2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour <br>  1/2 teaspoon baking soda <br>  1/2 teaspoon baking powder <br>  1/2 teaspoon table salt <br>  1/2 pound butter (2 sticks), salted<br>  1 cup packed dark brown sugar <br>  1 cup granulated sugar <br>  1 cup extra-crunchy peanut butter , preferably Jif<br>  2 large eggs <br>  2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br>  1 cup roasted salted peanuts , ground in food processor to resemble bread crumbs, about 14 pulses (about 1 cup, packed)<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Adjust oven rack to low center position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl.<br>  <br>  2. In bowl of electric mixer or by hand, beat butter until creamy. Add sugars; beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes with electric mixer, stopping to scrape down bowl as necessary. Beat in peanut butter until fully incorporated, then eggs, one at a time, then vanilla. Gently stir dry ingredients into peanut butter mixture. Add ground peanuts; stir gently until just incorporated.<br>  <br>  3. Working with 2 tablespoons dough at a time (see illustration 1 below), roll into large balls, placing them 2 inches apart on a parchment-covered cookie sheet. Following illustration 2, press each dough ball with back of dinner fork dipped in cold water to make crisscross design. Bake until cookies are puffed and slightly brown along edges, but not top, 10 to 12 minutes (they will not look fully baked). Cool cookies on cookie sheet until set, about 4 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely. Cookies will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, up to 7 days.  Makes approximately 3 dozen cookies<br>  <br>  --March 1998, Cooks Illustrated|`|LNeSlzCCaa	You could make bannanas and peanut butter...mmmm yummy|`|sKus5fXraa	Peanut Butter recipe can be found at <a href="http://recipe.thewikiz.com" rel="nofollow">http://recipe.thewikiz.com</a>|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	use a box of brownie mix. make them according to the box. then add 1 cup of peanut butter and then add some reese pb cups after the mix is all mixed and bake like the box says YUMMY!|`|puMU4dIwaa	my sister makes PB&cheese sandwiches. or u could b like Elvis & have fried PB& banana sandwiches

That is where family history comes into play. There is obviously a lot more too it but that is the jist of it.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I don't think it's a specific #.

bv5kbxvUaa	You could have a bagel with cream cheese...|`|sG5FKmAYaa	Baked beans, fried potatoes, sausage rings, bacon, mushrooms and tomatoes.<br>  <br>  (I would have eggs also, but you did say no eggs.)|`|AA10928232	Chicken, Tuna, or Egg Salad on Wheat Toast or stuffed into a tomato half<br>  Leftover pizza|`|ozWi3TJlaa	You didn't say "no fruit."  If you have fruit and a blender, you can still make a decent smoothie.  Put the fruit in the blender, add some honey, a little vanilla, yogurt (if you have it), and presto!  Instant smoothie.  If it's too thick, just thin it with a little water.  Not thick enough, use ice cubes.<br>  <br>  A sprinkling of cinnamon doesn't hurt anything, either :)|`|4mdUJ9LHaa	OK, this is a favorite of mine. Take clean celery, and spread peanut butter on the U shaped side. Then, sprinkle raisins on it. There is also grilled cheese. Put slices of cheese on bread, and fry it in a pan until it gets crispy on the outside. Flip it over and do the same thing. Make sure to put butter, or Pam TM on the frying pan, as yo will not have burnt down cheese sticking to it. The best of luck! <br>                 -Brook
5QicX6O4aa	Yes, but start with a teaspoon.|`|daBtvDv7aa	yes but it wont taste the same|`|tFAKwsv6aa	Yes but use sparingly...fresh is less potent.  I would try a teaspoon  or a little more only.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Sure you can, but you should really keep a jar of minced garlic in your fridge for recipes like that.  Most stores sell them in the produce section.  The jarred version lasts a long time.  I would use less than 1 tsp.  You can always add more.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Garlic powder works just fine and you don't have to pick out the pieces of garlic when you eat the food.  I hate picking out the garlic..bleh.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	Yes you can i know my sister in law uses the galic powder if she does not have fresh garlic|`|jCeylLsIaa	you'll ruin your recipe. leave the garlic powder to fastfoods. also, if you use garlic, get the smaller variety. Those about the circumference of a quarter...(they're more than 100% more expensive than the usual big variety)...now THAT's GARLIC!|`|Hb1CtqUKaa	i wouldnt do it, recipes say that for a reason, so i would just go with exactly what it says and then after the first time cooking it then you can tweak the recipe to your taste.|`|b5IKISHBaa	Using fresh garlic and ginger is a must in most recipe's,as powdered variety do not even come close.<br>  Garlic and ginger are very cheap and keep for ages so why not put them on your shopping list.|`|8BGehWCoaa	You can try but it definitely won't taste the same.  Use 1 tsp garlic powder for every clove of fresh garlic your recipe calls for.
L2Nde54Haa	live dangerously!!!|`|zhk8o514aa	Odds are it's fine.  It will just be dry and brittle.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Usually BEST BEFORE date simply means what it says.  From [in your case] 11th January the product will not be as good as was previously the case.<br>  <br>  Please check the product to see if there is a SELL BY or EAT BY or EAT BEFORE date.<br>  <br>  My instinct tells me NOT to eat anything past it's BEST BEFORE or SELL BY date[s].|`|q4tTabfjaa	It is illegal to have this sent to this country and in the view of the possibility of foot and mouth or mad cows disease etc, no one should risk the diseases of other countries.  Eat it if you want to risk your life, just don't get stuff off your friend again and dispose of it with care.  Apparently mad cow spores are not killed by drying.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	YES! It is technically smoked, cooked meat! It is actually better this way...although I wouldn't go too long, because beef jerky is best when eatten right away-<br>  <br>  hope this helped : )|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	It should have enough preservatives to be safe, though it might be tougher than intended.|`|mkA615Ataa	best before dates are just a guideline that have to be put on by law, you can eat things after this date and beef jerky is likely to be fairly safe. if something had a use by date on it instead then you'd be best advised to stick to it.|`|Mwhclezaaa	Best before relates to quality, use by relates to safety|`|O40b66Lhaa	no|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	I think it should be alright, but make sure there's a restroom nearby!|`|7izZ17ncaa	yeah eat it, it's dry.|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	yer its oks -x
jO3rt1bTaa	Drink more water to help ease the pain and just wait it out. Don't eat too much quickly. This happens to me quite often!|`|2RzEaod9aa	"Doctor, it hurts when I do this!"<br>  "Then don't do that!"<br>  <br>  You complaining about meat pains is like asking us why you get hangovers after a night of binge drinking: it comes with the territory. If you want the pain to go away, stop eating the meat.<br>  <br>  Nothing says "nostalgia" quite like stomach pain.|`|UM8EFzIMaa	No, in your case there isn't. Those are pangs of guilt and your conscience is responsible. Unless you're allergic to a specific meat there's no physical reason it would upset your stomach no matter how long you've gone without. That's just propaganda that the vegers here in V&V who aren't here in an attempt to persuade you will admit readily as such.|`|doz7RIoeaa	If you eat meat only during holidays and festive occasions, chances are meat is not the problem, over eating is. If you eat meat on a fairly regular basis even though its months apart, you won't get any ill effects. The " my body is not used to it" part is probably mostly in your mind.|`|6K1D6Azmaa	You need to eat smaller portions of meat when you do. <br>  <br>  But if you can't stop yourself from gorging on meat when you do eat it, perhaps your body is trying to tell you something. Maybe you are not filling your body's needs with your present diet, or you are not meant to be a vegetarian. ?|`|vGhhoQQkaa	I find meat really hard to digest so that's part of the reason I went vegetarian.<br>  <br>  I get stomach pains when I eat it too...maybe try smaller portions of it...or give it up all together...have you tried the fake meats on sale...some are really nice!|`|xh4LTb6vaa	Then you're not a real vegetarian - try to exclude everything based on someones death. If this is not an option to you - stab a knife in your stomach - the pain is going to extreme but for quite a short time.

INPrlW6Maa	Recipe for Chapati or Roti or Pulka<br>  <br>  <br>    Once you taste these unleavened, unsalted simple breads - a person is hooked.  This is simple, unpretentious home cooking but very satisfying, healthy and easy on the pocket book.   There are also excellent for those with a yeast allergy.  Rotis are made from small balls of dough that are rolled out and then partially cooked on a hot griddle and then finished directly over high heat.   The high heat makes the rotis puff up into a ball.  They are then lightly coated with ghee to keep them pliable until serving time.  Line a tortilla basket with a napkin and keep the rotis in it.  Allow 2-3 chapatis or rotis per person.  This is everyday Indian bread made in most Indian homes daily.<br>  <br>  Ingredients to make about 6:<br>  2.5 cups chappati flour with 1 cup water at room temperature made into a dough<br>  1 cup chappati flour in a large plate for dusting the dough while rolling it out<br>  ghee for brushing the bread<br>  <br>  Method to roll out the dough:<br>  Prepare the desired amount of dough from the Basic Dough recipe. After resting for 2-2 1/2 hours, knead well. Divide the dough into peach-size balls. On a lightly floured surface, flatten one ball of dough with your hand. Using a rolling-pin, roll out the dough into a thin,round patty, about 5 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, turning patty several times to prevent sticking. Try to make the edges slightly thinner than the center. As you cook the chappati/roti, one could be rolling out the next, rather than shaping all of the chapatis at one time.<br>  <br>  Method of cooking the chappati or roti:<br>  Preheat a cast-iron tawa over medium heat. Place the rolled dough on the palm of one hand and flip it over on to the tawa. When the color changes on the top and bubbles appear, turn it over. When both sides are done, use kitchen tongs (chimta) to remove the chapati from the skillet. <br>  Gas Stove: If you have a gas stove, hold the cooked chapati over a medium flame and it will puff up immediately. Turn quickly to flame-bake the other side. Do this several times, taking care that the edges are well cooked. <br>  Electric Stove: If you have an electric stove, chapatis can be encouraged to puff by pressing them with a clean kitchen towel after the first turn on each side. Repeat the shaping and cooking  process until all chapatis are cooked. <br>  <br>  To keep the chapatis warm as they are cooked, place them in a towel-lined bowl and fold over the sides of the towel. Serve hot, either completely dry or topped with a small amount of ghee or butter.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	The one thing about any Indian bread is the right ratio of ingredients to liquids but resting the dough, if you do not allow the flour and water to hydrate the flour particles and make the dough less chewy, and the ratio of atta flour to water is key, plus not over working the dough, atta flour has no gluten structure compared to that of a puri or naan/paratha.<br>  <br>  Add a small amount of ghee or ground nut oil in the dough will help, just make sure to let the dough sit for 20-30 minute after making it to relax and then divide use the roti press or by hand and cook them evenly, plus pile them and cover them up to allow the steam to be released slower.|`|0mNIIpUraa	Hi <br>  The person who answered first has said everything so precisely, there is nothing to answer, but yet, i would like to mention that i had similar problems like you have. what i did, i bought a food processor (cuisinart if you live in the US). i started to make dough with this food processor. all you need is, 2 cups of atta ( wheat flour) one cup water and put salt and a bit of oil before you put water allow it blend for like 10 secs, then put water and blend, within few seconds, the atta will start to roll out, once you see that it is rolling out (like a ball) the atta is done, then remove it, just knead with yr hands once or twice, soak it for 30 minutes.<br>  then you follow the methods of the first person whoa nswered, your rotis/phulkas with be supersoft, you will love it.you will also save your shoulders by kneading. i am so much enjoying with this, my atta is done in 1 or 1.5 mins at the most.|`|yUAChUU4aa	the flour doesnt matter much.but if it is tight then dont use any dry flour or use less dry flour.and if it is loose then u can use dry flour in a sufficient amount but not much.b'coz much use of it wud make it hard.<br>  secondly if u are making chapaties at tawa (pan) then dont make it on low fire or at sim.<br>  thirdly,the way u make it flat(belna) may be not good.it should be flattened equally frm each side...<br>  hope this will help u..
KWhKwgsSaa	This is an answer I provided the other day to someone looking to make their own chocolate chip morsels.  For your situation, you would pour the chocolate into a mold and skip the step that instructs to chop it into pieces for making chocolate chip cookies.  Also, after searching this was the ONLY recipe I found:<br>  <br>  <br>  Homemade Semi Sweet chocolate Chips<br>  <br>  12 oz (340 grams) unsweetened chocolate<br>  1 Tablespoon of Butter<br>  12 Tablespoons of Corn Syrup<br>  1/4 Cup of Milk (preferably whole milk)<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  Set-up a double-boiler (or make your own with 1 large pot, a strainer, and one small pot) with water. Don’t fill up too much water, we don’t want any to splatter into the chocolate!<br>  <br>  Set the double boiler on high heat. Add the butter and corn syrup and start melting it. Add the milk, and stir together until the butter has completely melted, then stir in your chocolate pieces. Once the water of the double boiler has started to boil, reduce the heat to low - or the chocolate will burn. Stir constantly until the chocolate has almost completely melted, then remove from heat and continue to stir until the chocolate has completely melted.<br>  <br>  Pour into a mold. I used a silicon bread mold b/c it’s easiest to loosen the chocolate once it’s hardened. But, I’m sure you could use some sort of other plastic container.<br>  <br>  The chocolate will re solidify with time…I was impatient and put mine in the freezer.<br>  <br>  Once the chocolate is completely solid, press it out of the mold and chop it into chips on a chopping block with a large knife.<br>  <br>  This makes enough for one chocolate chip cookie recipe.<br>  <br>  *** I can't guarantee the success of this recipe using alternative ingredients, but a substitution for 1 bar of unsweetened chocolate is 3 T. cocoa and 1 T. butter or 3 T. cocoa and 1 T. shortening.
jKh5M53Yaa	Nope. Calories is a measure of how much energy you get from food products, I don't think smell gives you energy. Unless you mean mental energy of course! <br>  <br>  Actually you can get slim by smelling? Smell is supposed to make you feel fuller so you eat less....... mmmh..|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	You get fat when your body breaks down sugars and oils and absorbs them into your body, via your digestive system.  Your nose, not being a part of that system, can't break it down and make you fat.  However, as a caveat to that, being exposed to greasy foods on a constant basis (working in fast food) can affect your respiratory system and skin very negatively.|`|DEGClROKaa	haha no.<br>  You need to consume food to accumulate calories.<br>  <br>  I have to admit that is an interesting thought.

NkEHCHsOaa	People develop a resistance to alcohol, and tolerance is different for each individual. The more someone drinks the more it takes for them to feel effects and the more they can "hold".<br>  <br>  Drinking 4 shots every day is doable by most people, but a maintaning of that level of alcohol usually develops adverse effects over time and can ruin health and eventually kill, or sometimes a cerosis of the liver crops up and takes them out quickly.<br>  <br>  You never know when someone can develop the disease of alcoholism. It could be rather quickly and become a bain on their who life, or it could take a while, or some never do develope alcoholism, but it can still harm you because of the effects on the body can be very damaging. Alcohol is a poison a toxin and how much will really hurt you is something you won't know until it does.<br>  <br>  Some people can drink 2 liters a day, which is certainly way beyond normal. Most heavy drinkers who are not just crazed can drink about 2/3 of a liter in a good day of drinking, to a bottle, but that won't last too long before it really starts screwing them up. That much alcohol to someone who is not used to it will really trash them.<br>  <br>  The best thing for health, is to leave alcohol alone.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	lol one handle. ha|`|AP2e90cCaa	'Normal' people don't drink rum Every day.<br>  <br>  That being said, I like to have at least one glass of wine a night with dinner or to unwind.<br>  <br>  If you 'have' to have that drink or are drinking enough rum to get 'drunk' every night, or if your drinking interferes with you being able to do other things, then you've got a drinking problem.<br>  <br>  Also remember that even if you're only having a drink or two a night, as I do, even small amounts of alcohol does damage to your liver over a time and is generally unhealthy (do you know how many calories are in alcoholic beverages?!? blah!).<br>  <br>  Take a week off from drinking and notice if you're 'craving' that drink or not. If you are - call someone for help and nip this in the bud before it becomes a problem you can't fix.|`|7nJnk2OGaa	5 to 6 liters

vvJBtxXHaa	to avoid too much juice, de-seed most of those tomatoes, cut them in quarters and scrape the seeds out...I try to leave some of the meat...oh, and if you're blessed with some cheese cloth, that is perfect to strain away the juice from the seeded portion...then you can add back the nice flavorful meat (and those seeds, sigh)<br>  <br>  ...i usually serve quartered lime slices in a bowl on the side too, for those folks who enjoy "tweeking" the flavors a bit<br>  <br>  ....30 minutes is enough time for these flavors to mingle...to an hour, in the fridge....the acidity mingles rapidly<br>  <br>  ..have you asked the deli/produce guy at the suprmarket if he stocks and chilies?...those are excellent for the "pico" part (and colorful)<br>  <br>  ....as for the avocado, it'll turn black really fast if you add it early....that'd be best added at the very last minute<br>  ....as for sweet bell pepper, that'd be your choice to use (colorful yellows, greens, orange, red...) my personal preference is simply without bell pepper, but with avocado<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Always do the KISS - KEEP IT SUPER SIMPLE!<br>  <br>  Pico de gallo can be made yesterday and placed in a tightly covered container in the fridge.

You want the flavors to blend, and the salt and pepper to permeate through everything.|`|AA10998789	Make it this afternoon but don't add the avocado until you are ready to serve.

The minimum I let mine rest in the refrigerator is 4 hours.  I use the exact same ingredients, except I used a small glove of minced garlic, puree is a good idea.|`|53giV6PFaa	I would keep it the way you have it to have a classic pico de gallo.  Make it in the morning so the flavors blend.  If there is too much liquid when you serve, then just drain off the excess.  Using it the same day and keeping it properly stored it will taste fresh when you serve it.  If you make it right before, it will taste fresh, but the flavors won't get a chance to blend together.

On the contrary, it's the easiest meal you will ever prepare and, in my opinion, the very best. <br>  <br>  Here's my method.<br>  1 6 rib standing rib beef roast 6-8 lbs<br>  Lawrey's Garlic & herb Seasonong (almost the whole jar)<br>  Olive Oil<br>  Preheat oven to 450°F. (if your oven is not calibrated properly use an oven thermometer for accuracy) <br>  Rub seasonings over surfaces of roast.<br>  Coat roast liberally with olive oil. Every square inch do not be stingy. This helps sear and crisp up the outside of the roast. (if you like you can use my trick of spray olive oil it makes it a bit less messy)<br>  COAT THE ENTIRE ROAST WITH A LAYER of seasoning. Be Generous. Keep putting it on until there's a visible LAYER of seasoning. This will melt away a bit and soak in a bit and create an outer layer of goodness that you won't believe. Coat every square inch of top, sides, bottom, bones, etc. (not the ends) The oil will help the stuff stick. Then, add a bit more pepper and salt for good measure.<br>  Place roast, bone side down (the bones serve in place of a meat rack), in shallow roasting pan.<br>  Roast 15 minutes.<br>  Insert meat thermometer into prime rib.<br>  Reduce oven temperature to 325°F.<br>  Roast 20 minutes per pound or until internal temperature is 120°F to 130°F for rare, 135°F to 145°F for medium.<br>  When roast has reached desired temperature, transfer to cutting board; tent with foil. Let stand in warm place 20 to 30 minutes to allow for easier carving. Temperature of roast will continue to rise about 10°F during stand time.<br>  <br>  Serve with a nice salad and a stemed veggie and you are all set.<br>  <br>  Bon Apetit|`|k6hbtPBRaa	you can grill this or not.

I found it easier to remove the cake in one piece from the pan when I buttered the bottom of the pan and sprinkled on flour before putting the batter in." <br>   Let cool (I did this the night before and didn't really let it cool enough... it really should be completely cool before you start) <br>    <br>   If your cake has a bulging center, trim it a bit so it's flat on top (this shouldn't be a huge problem in the 9x13 rectangular pans... I didn't have to trim mine<br>     <br>   Turn the cake out onto a piece of tinfoil.    This is easier than it sounds!   <br>   Make sure you run a knife around the edges first so there's nothing sticking.   <br>   You'll notice from my lovely photo that my cake stuck and tore a bit.   <br>    just pieced it back together as best I could... it didn't seem to hurt anything.<br>   <br>   If you have time to leave it sit for 24 hours at this point, that's your best bet (it's less crumby if you do).  <br>  I, of course, did not have time for this -- I'm sure Martha would have.<br>     <br>   Tips:<br>  <br>  "Instead of just leaving it sit for 24 hours that if you freeze your cake it is much easier to ice and you can just brush crumbs off. "  Thanks for the advice Amber!<br>     <br>   cut out the template pieces and arrange them on your cake.  <br>     <br>   Use toothpicks to hold the template in place (poke them through the paper into the cake)<br>     <br>   Cut around the template pieces with a sharp knife.  Be nice and smooth about it (I did it with the point of the knife)<br>     <br>   This is actually an easy cake to do freehand (without the template)  It's just a big oval with a couple of ears.<br>     <br>   Remove the template from the cake.<br>     <br>   Remove all the scraps and put them aside (try not to rip the cake when you're removing the scraps).<br>     <br>   Arrange the cake on a covered board (we used our cutting board and just covered it with tinfoil).  Make sure all the pieces are touching properly.<br>     <br>   Spread white icing on the cake (I've read that you're supposed to do the sides first, but I always start with the top).<br>     <br>   I added about 1 1/2 Tbsp of milk to the one can store bought icing to make it a bit easier to spread.  Julieanne adds that if you add 1 to 2 Tbsp of corn syrup instead of milk that the icing will spread much better and you won't get as many crumbs!<br>     <br>   If you get crumbs on your knife, get a new knife (it sounds simple, but it took me awhile to realize how helpful it would be to switch knives when they got crumby)<br>     <br>   Use jelly beans or decorator gel to add two eyes and one nose (she doesn't have a mouth)<br>     <br>   Tie the fruit by the foot into a bow and place it over the ear.<br>     <br>   Close the template window after printing to return to this screen. <br>       <br>   Set page margins to zero if you have trouble fitting the template on one page (FILE, PAGE SETUP or FILE, PRINTER SETUP in most browsers).|`|NDvFr6gfaa	watch some videos of  skilled cake makers(people)  or you can buy one from the store|`|53giV6PFaa	Here is a site that has the coolest birthday cakes with pictures and instructions on how the bakers did them.

The refrig always has cream cheese.<br>  I always keep the basic basics, flour, oil, leavening, cans of sweetened condensed and Milnot. Cans of certain veggies, jello and fruit are always there, too. I must have cocoa powder and powdered sugar in the house.<br>  The secret is to build your recipe knowledge base, pick out those things that you will cook with often and store well, and keep them in the house. <br>  I bake, and I keep the spices for pumpkin pie and all my regular recipes. Onion and garlic powder work fine when you can't get to the store for the real thing, I keep the dried onion, too. I always keep pecans, wrapped in multiple layers of foil and plastic in the freezer. <br>  One trick I learned: since we all do so much baking and cooking at the holidays, I have a Xmas stock up list, so I am ready at a moments notice to cook all my fav recipes. It paid off this year, I had molasses cookie and cheesecake recipe stuff on hand, picked up the cream for the cake at the store on a scheduled trip, and I was ready. Look for things that are versitle to keep, like elbow pasta, and egg noodles, those two items are the basis to a world of recipes like tuna casserole, chili mac, mac and cheese, soups, and on and on. <br>  I find that if I have to go to the store when the cooking urge gets me, it takes some of the joy out of cooking. As a young person just moved into my first apartment, I would have thought that shopping then cooking was a real fun time. Not anymore. I plan the menu for one or two weeks, buy it, keep my stock stuff in the house, and that does it for me.

AA12176630	Beer is 90% water.The rest is malt,sugars,yeast and alcohol.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	that would depend on how much beer you want to make.|`|m1cEbzBcaa	beer is mostly water<br>  <br>  so if you were making 5 gallons of beer, you would need nearly 5 gallons of beer (some of the volume is malt, sugar & hops).
yJ31VS79aa	You can't sober up.<br>  The alcohol has to be processed through your system. Your liver can only process so much per hour.<br>  Exactly one glass of beer, a glass of wine, and one ounce of hard liquor.<br>  The only thing that taking a shower does is now you have a wet drunk.<br>  Drinking caffeine makes a hyper drunk.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Yes, Mr Officer|`|axxQzOCHaa	drink less alcohol, and more water|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	As a recovered alcoholic I have plenty of experience in this field, also as an ex medical rep I can tell you definitively that there is no way to sober up faster than your liver can get rid of the alcohol out of your system and that's a proven fact.<br>  <br>  There are things however that will make you feel better, most of which have been mentioned, drinking water and rest, all drinking coffee will do is to make you a wide awake drunk.<br>  <br>  So your best bet is a pint of water, a couple of paracetamols and back to bed.|`|GhETSRdUaa	It's all in your head. Keep telling yourself that you're not drunk. That sounds really stupid, but it actually sobers you up more than anything.<br>  <br>  That's why, unless you're intoxicated beyond belief, you lose your drunkenness (sp?) in serious situations, because you find more devotion in your mind to pay attention to that, rather than how drunk you are. Does that make sense? I hope so.|`|kFlMHSKIaa	not too drink so much alcohol in the first place.|`|BEqAhXBlaa	Water and sleep|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	Shock!! Failing this, try the following;<br>  <br>  ~Black sweet coffee with something with a bit of grease (the grease helps to mix with the alcohol and soaks it up)<br>  <br>  ~Berrocca - this is a vitamin which you can buy from your local supermarket/chemist and it makes you feel better within half an hour<br>  <br>  ~Water/milk (preferably before you start drinking. Drink two pints within half an hour). This will prevent hangovers in the morning<br>  <br>  ~Other than the above, sleep in great.|`|RibcM7TRaa	Drink water and find somthing else 2 do like bulid some **** or work overtime on your job|`|nLy4TcjZaa	They're is no fast way to sober up, you just need to drink water and rest.|`|mdR98GYMaa	Have carbs that will absorb the alcohol and lots of water/juice|`|AA11399396	Eat bread and drink a lot of water.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Don't drink|`|vpN3xdsMaa	I think milk.|`|CceiP7q5aa	sit outside and drink a pint of water|`|3Ks21ASDaa	Nothing but time can "sober you up". Not a shower, not sleep, not bread, not water. I promise.

z25aqkDjaa	no, it does not.<br>  meat should not really be charred though...bummer!<br>  normally you need both raw and steamed veggies.in theory yes,you loose vitamins when boiling or even steamming-depends on the veggie,but the problem is some items can not be digested if u do not cook them.there are things that benefit from others,like tomatoes "act" better when you have them with a little oil-of course go for pored from the bottle olive oil,this is the best way to have it-poured into soups,salads cold from the bottle.we all know that deep frying is not too good......combining the italian dish pasta and beans gets you the full benefit from iron in the beans...lentils have tons of iron..but it is not absorbed in the body,not all of it-i forget the trick for getting all of it though....my gastroenterologyst told me well boiled broccoli is good stomach cancer fighter.<br>  i guess my beloved creamed spinach looses any benefits since it is soooooooo boiled ...so when i eat it,i do not count it as part of my 5 veggies 4 the day!|`|vv2uk9hHaa	No it does not destroy the proteins, it denaturates them: they lose raw conformation. It's just a molecular change. Actually, pretty much the same thing happens when you eat something raw and it gets in contact with the acid in your stomach, it denaturates the proteins. So no worries about the protein content of foods. And it doesn't change a bloody thing nutrition-wise if they are denaturated or not, because what your body uses is the amino acids (a protein is a chain of amino acids). So no matter what shape the protein has, it'll still be broken down in exactly the same amino acids. The only concern is that overcooking can alter the texture of foods and make them less enjoyable to eat. Vitamins, on the other hand, are usually much more fragile molecules that can be broken down with heat. And since a lot of them are water soluble, you might lose a bit by boiling. So cook your meat to your heart's content (although I personally prefer rare red meat) but be careful not to overcook your vegetables or fruits. And don't worry about heating milk either, it'll be just as nutritious. Hope this shed some life on the wonderful world of proteins.|`|yHk0DWeUaa	Yes, vitamins, amino acids, etc are only so heat tolerant before they break down where as minerals are not. To cook the bloody hell out of something renders it pretty useless nutrition wise. The less cooking time the better, staying within safe guidelines for specific foods.|`|P59aCmiVaa	Depends on time of cooking and sort of food.<br>  If you eat raw meat or fish, you will be sick.

That works well for a 8" round cake.  Watch the time, toaster oven cooks faster.  You can buy microwavable cake desserts that are great.|`|InvPKVJ7aa	Make an ice cream cake.  <br>  <br>  Line a pan with plastic wrap, leaving excess wrap hanging over the edges (you'll later use this like handles to remove it from the pan)<br>  <br>  Then line the bottom and sides of the pan with oreo cookies.  <br>  <br>  In a separate bowl allow ice cream to soften and stir (just to make it an even consistancy)<br>  <br>  Layer ice cream on top of cookies - you can use a couple different ice cream flavours to make layers.  You can add crumbled oreo cookies between each layer of ice cream for added interest.  <br>  <br>  Top with whip cream<br>  <br>  Place in the freezer until solid.<br>  <br>  When ready to serve, lift from pan and slice.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Use a heavy cast iron dutch oven.

InvPKVJ7aa	Empanada's.   They are like little beef patties - you can do any flavour too - cheese empanada's, chicken, seafood, veggie, etc.  Make or buy pastery, fill, seal the edges, and bake.   I think it's one of their national foods...  Google Empanada
