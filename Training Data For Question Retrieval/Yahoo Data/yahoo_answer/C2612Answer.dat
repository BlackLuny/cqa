SOfbIOzUaa	Use whatever your owner's manual says to use.<br>  <br>  Oil viscosity requirements use to be determined by outdoor temperature. <br>  <br>  That is no longer how they are figured. Let's face it, once your engine is warmed up it will run at the same internal temperature in the summer and winter.<br>  <br>  Some Honda vehicles now call for a 5W20 oil year round and others call for a 5W30 oil. A lot depends on how the engine is designed and the tolerances of the engine.<br>  <br>  Use what Ford recommends for the Focus. If they recommend 5W30 or 10W30 then you can also use 0W30 but not 5W20 or 0W20. If they recommend 5W20 then you may use 0W20.<br>  <br>  DON'T listen to a good garage, they are only telling you what they know from the old school way of doing things. The car manufacturers have technicians who are much more qualified than any local garages.<br>  <br>  Thicker is Better Myth<br>  The reason that oil viscosities have gotten thinner is because bearing clearances have become smaller. Using thicker oils will interfere with oil flow and the oil pressure will increase. In a worn engine it may be okay to increase the viscosity of the oil because the bearing clearances have become larger.  <a href="http://www.nordicgroup.us/oil.htm#Why%20do%20many%20oil%20change%20places,%20even%20dealerships,%20use%2010W30%20instead%20of%205W30,%20even%20when%205W30%20is%20preferred?" rel="nofollow">http://www.nordicgroup.us/oil.htm#Why%20...</a>|`|DV4xyeChaa	im a fan of 10 w 40 in summer and 5w 40 winter.....todays oils r very good...the 40 gives MORE protection and the first # is thickness... the 5w flowes better in cold|`|Gc8ORtMuaa	Ford in the UK recommend 5W30 for the Focus, for all year round, so I would stick with that. 15W40 will be a lot thicker when cold, so will not lubricate the engine as well. Chances are a 15w40 will not meet the recommended specification (WSS M2C913-B or -C) for the engine either.<br>  <br>  Oil selection has become a lot more difficult in the last few years, as engines get more precisely manufactured and more complex in their design. Even within a particular grade (eg 5W30, there might be 5 or 6 different types). Look at either of the websites below and you can check what oil you car should take.|`|fOmH3wUvaa	The number after the W should always be the same as recommended by the manufacturer. In this case, it is a 30, so leave it at 30. The first number should be as low as possible. For 30 weight oil that is typically 5.<br>  <br>  That is how the manufacturer came to the 5W-30 number.<br>  <br>  If the manufacturer specified engine bearing clearances to be small, then 5W-20 would be recommended.<br>  <br>  The number after the W is the weight of the oil which determines the oil viscosity after the engine has warmed up. This temperature is about the same for any car in any climate unless it overheats.That is why you should keep the number the same. The engine is designed to run with 30 weight oil when warm.<br>  <br>  The number before the W is the weight of the oil at 0 deg. F. Cold oil is thicker than warm oil. The number before the W means that the oil is modified to be thinner when cold than straight 30 weight oil. In warm weather, but much worse in cold weather, the 30 weight oil cannot lubricate the engine as well. Modified oil such as 5W-30 is used to provide thinner oil weight at low temperatures and the regular oil weight once the oil warms up.<br>  <br>  This dual oil weight is done with polymer modifiers. The modifiers curl up into a ball when cold. As they warm up, they stretch out into a star shape. The expanded shape cause the oil to thicken up. For example, take straight 5 weight oil and add modifiers. When it's cold, it is 5 weight oil. As it warms up, it could be 20 weight or 30 weight depending on how many modifiers are added. <br>  <br>  That is how 5W-30 is made.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	Stick with the 5w-30 all season oil. 15w-40 is way to thick for that model/year and for those temp fluctuations. Where I live in the US the temps are from -40 to 100 degrees F. I say to stay with what the manufacture specifications recommend. <br>  <br>  I do and no problems.

d6bUhFnjaa	Black ice is dangerous because you don't see it or even know it's there until you drive over it, what makes it so bad is that when people realize they hit the ice, they tend to over correct their steering by turning the wheel this way or that way and when you hit the dry pavement with your wheels turned a little it will throw you out of aline with the lane you was driving in causing you to swerve and then you may over correct again causing you to really go out of control, If you think you hit some black ice just let off the gas and keep you car straight, Don't turn your wheel even if you feel the car going to the side for a second, just keep it straight so that you can hit the dry road as straight as you can, and if possible give yourself extra time and room. and slow down and don't drive with the cruise control on when the roads are not perfect.|`|AA10672842	Most Canadians are no stranger to black ice.It is so dangerous because it is almost invisible on the road until you are almost on top of it.Even when the weatherman forecasts the possibility of black ice drivers continue to drive too fast and too close for road and weather conditions which makes for  a perfect recipe for an accident.It only takes seconds for the commute to turn deadly.The simple solution is to slow down but many people overlook that .Take care.|`|C1Cobi1taa	It's because it freezes "clear" but is viewed as black because of the road color.

I suspect that the pilot got behind the 'power curve' and couldn't recover - that is airspeed too slow, altitude too low, high rate of descent and not enough power to recover.  The engines were probably at a low power setting and it takes time for turbofan engines to get up to speed from low power settings.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	Jet engines can suffer what is known as a compressor stall, characterised by a "pop" and surge, it's more akin to a backfire in a piston engine than anything else.

When they can't cope or afford to expand, you get the delays and long lines you mention.<br>  <br>  The commercial airline industry isn't cheap, a 300 seater aircraft costs tens of millions of dollars and it costs millions to maintain, not to mention the expense of fuel. Everything on an aircraft costs 4 times more than the non-aviation equivalent. Its way too easy to lose money.

bf5QeTiGaa	my advice to you is keep appealing as long as you can they all try to put you off but up against a judge or magistrate they might look worse off. you don't know what trouble they've been in before the police can't be bothered nowadays and sounds like could be case for racial get free advice from solicitor search till you find one who will accept you and see what they say . Also keep contacting your insurance company speak to different people and supervisor etc. you have to be pushy a bit cos no-one can be bothered, but you'll be surprised once you question them. explain what happened exactly to the solicitor and if they think you haven't got  a chance  then go for 50/50 settlement at least it won't be that much and you both get the blame, but don't give up fighting till your definitely sure you haven't got a chance get 2nd or 3rd opinion from different solicitors if needs be!!! Hope all goes well.|`|XLXncQu9aa	First of all, I seriously doubt that race is a factor in this case.  So we can rule that out immediately.  Secondly, your insurance company is right.  Going to court over this case would cost you money in the process and you would likely lose the case.  So if I were you I wouldn't bother dealing with this.  The report was already filed, so you can't go back and have another report filed even if the person lied.  This is called, "fraud".  The person lied about the accident and in return, you lose because of the other person's underhandedness.  So going to court would be a waste of your time.  Its a sad case of fraud and you unfortunately were the victim.

Not saying you can't, but it takes a lot of money and you still wouldn't have the performance of a modern 4 cylinder sport bike engine.<br>  It will take cams, head and valve work, pistons, rods, ignition upgrades, and new Mapping of the ECU.  For starts.<br>  Here is an example of the limitations.  A Harley engine is a long stroke, small bores, so there is not much room for improvements with the size of the valves.  Modern 4 cylinder engines use large bore, small stroke configuration.  These engines are equipped with four valves per cylinder.  Better breathing which allows more fuel in each cylinder.  Bigger boom, more horsepower.<br>  Not dissing Harleys, just pointing out the saying of Cubic Dollars is very true when it comes to performance from a Harley.<br>  Enjoy your ride and keep the shiny side up.|`|hjDB62VGaa	Screamin' Eagle or Buell parts both available at your friendly, neighborhood Harley-Davidson dealer.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would use the same parts found on the XR1200.

The longest continuously produced vehicle in American history. The Nightster in particular harkens back to a different era when bobbed Sportys were the two wheeled hot rods of choice, in 68 or 69 I believe it was the platform used to break a land speed record. Can you believe it? Those days are gone. Be happy that you have a piece of that history.<br>  <br>  Ride the Nightster with the understanding that you are on something of a time machine, second only to the XL883, that allows you to get as close to experiencing what it was like to ride a motorcycle 50 years ago without buying a vintage bike for half a year's salary. Ride thus and the Nightster will become a source of happiness and contentment known only to a few monks in the high Himalayas. Ride it with the idea that you are going to hot rod your way to some modern finish line and you will be find the Nightster a source of ridicule and derision known only to those few who would admit an affinity toward Barry Manilow in a Mississippi holding cell.<br>  <br>  There really isn't much you can do to a 1200 Sporty but If money is no object drop it off at the dealer, tell them to let 'er rip, and come back in a week. It probably won't cost much because most of what can be done has already been done in Kansas. I'm not sure you would notice much of a difference even with two into one pipes which, on the Nightster, seems antithetical.

tBq6ZDZvaa	You have a short in your gages. Do you have the Digital Dash on that one or is it the analog gages?. They used to have problems with the Digital gage cluster they would stop working. You could also just have corrosion in your electrical connectors. On those old Japanese cars they used regular rubber instead of synthetic rubber so as it ages the rubber gasket will dry out and crack so moister and dust can get into the connector and cause corrosion.

24kFbAdsaa	The 2009 Ford Focus has a mileage rating of 24/35.  Knock off about 10% because you are not driving in a laboratory environment.  Where in Mississippi?  Mileage is more important to your question that driving time.  Even though the speed limit on the interstate is 65, you will not average 65, you'll be closer to 55 because of gas breaks, meal brakes, pee breaks, traffic breaks, etc.  So, let's use 55 mph over 7 hrs, you'll travel about 385 miles @ 30 mpg = 12.8 gallons (call it 13 gallons @ $2 per = $26 in gas.

AA11087517	It's caused be a drop in pressure, which causes a drop in temperature.  The wings produces lift be creating an area of low pressure above the wing and when air pressure drops, temperature does as well.  Air can only hold a certain amount of water vapor, depending on temperature.  This is a how relative humidity is calculated:  the air is holding 70% of the water vapor that it can hold at that temperature.  Once the air is saturated (can't hold anymore water vapor), it has to get rid of it so the water condenses to liquid form, and then you can see it in the form of a cloud.  If it is humid (the air is holding close to its capacity of water), you can see the vapor condensing over an airplane's wing as it flies normally.  If the airplane is turning, the wing is working harder and creating a region of even lower pressure, thereby lowering the temperature and the water vapor capacity.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	The white streaks are clouds, or vapor trails. They are caused by a sudden drop in the air pressure at the wingtip, or some other rapid change in the aerodynamic shape that results in a large drop in ir pressure. When the pressure drops, it can't hold the water any more and it forms clouds.|`|kEjxtQNDaa	the white trail you see is compressed vapors  as the wing tip slices through the air the air under the wing moves outwards towards the tip. under a high G maneuvers that compression forms a visible vapor|`|fZjgIE9Baa	You can refer to this page- <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vor...</a><br>  <br>  The term is wingtip vortices|`|Ttp7dVFqaa	Vapour trails.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Vortices from certain points on the aircraft create unusually low-pressure zones in which water vapor in the air condenses, producing visible white trails behind the aircraft.  Areas like wingtips often produce these vortices.<br>  <br>  Other low-pressure zones you might notice are above the wings and behind the flaps, in the engine intakes, over and behind the stabilizers, and so on.  Certain atmospheric conditions favor these more than others.

0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Uh oh....Your fuel pump is going out on you.<br>  <br>  I own a 91' Chevy 2500, and had to replace mine after running out of gas in it twice.<br>  Running a truck low on fuel is very hard on the pump.<br>  The fuel is what cools it and lubricates it.<br>  <br>  I'll bet you've noticed it's hard to get on the freeway....<br>  Pretty soon you won't be able to do 50 mph.<br>  Then, you'll have a hard time doing 30 mph.<br>  Then, it will just start, run a couple seconds, then die.<br>  <br>  I had an estimate from a dealer to replace mine, as it broke down two blocks from the dealer. They wanted $700 labor plus parts.<br>  <br>  Here is what I recommend.<br>  1) Replace the fuel filter. (below the drivers seat inside the frame rail under the truck)<br>      While you have the filter off, stick a pressure gage on the fuel line from the tank. Turn the key on. See if the pressure goes at LEAST to 9psi. (two second timer) then turns off.<br>  Anything under that will be an indication that your fuel pump is worn.<br>  Try do drive it to less than 1/4 tank. Because the fuel tank is heavy when it's full.<br>  <br>  A new pump should cost a couple hundred dollars.<br>  <br>  If you want step by step help, Email me.|`|IICFEIE0aa	Gotta love spammers like Thomas.               Fuel filter would definitely help. Could also be the Throttle Position Sensor . Have your fuel pressure checked|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	The O2 sensor is not used at wide open throttle, the computer richens the mixture to help prevent detonation which exceeds the range the O2 can monitor. The MAP sensor could be your problem, as it (combined with the intake air temp, and throttle position sensor) picks up the duty of the O2, but should show a code if it's bad, I would say check your fuel pressure, injector pattern, timing, then the MAP.
0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Those are some good answers. However, looking at the dipstick will not always tell you that you have a blown head gasket.<br>  <br>  1) Fill the radiator all the way up and put the cap on.<br>  2) Fill the reservoir half way up.<br>  3) Start the car.<br>  <br>  Now, watch the overflow reservoir for bubbles coming from the tube from the radiator.<br>  <br>  It may take several minutes to pressurize the system to the bypass point.<br>  <br>  If you have a "pressure leak" in one of the cylinders, it will blow past the head gasket every time the cylinder fires which will pressurize the cooling system and therefor pass by the radiator cap after the cap reaches it maximum pressure rating. Usually 14-16 psi.<br>  <br>  There are other ways to check it, but they requires tools.<br>  This way works fine and doesn't need ANY tools.<br>  <br>  Oh, how does the inside of the radiator and the cap look?<br>  Oily?|`|zOIgzIy4aa	check the oil to see if anti-freeze is in it and does it smoke white smoke? if none of those are present then it could be a freeze plug leaking or the heater core is leaking on the floor. it don,t sound like the thermostat.|`|EmgiGg17aa	First off with the leak- I would hazard guessing a leaking hose at the clamps, then a pinhole in the hose or rad, or the water pump seal is gone.<br>    For the temperature fluxuation, I would first suspect the sensor,then maybe there is an air pocket behind the thermostat.   (Is that a top mount unit(on top of the block) or under the block.?  Filling procedures are different.)    Whatever, it is the thermostat I would next look at.  Head gasket way last.   Looking at the oil filler cap does not always give a clear picture as on an older engine, there is bound to be creaminess on it (as the atmosphere has moisture in it, so every time the engine cools down(overnight sleepy time) cool moist air re-enters the crankcase.|`|C2HHfun2aa	Yes look at the oil dip stick or the oil filler cap if the oil is milky white then you have a blown head gasket or cracked head or block. <br>  <br>  If the oil isn't milky white then replace your thermostat because it sounds like it may be sticking and also check that you do not have any leaking freeze plugs. If you car has an electric radiator fan check the temperature sensor that turns it off and on.|`|7ONMCI74aa	first check for leaks,hoses,heater core,radatior cap, anything that water goes through. check engine oil for water it will look milky if head is bad. turn on heat and defroster and if the windshield gets foggy from the inside it could be the heater core. sometimes they go bad and it is hard to spot because the water goes down the firewall or under the carpet.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Check your oil. If it looks foamy or milky, you have a blown gasket.|`|tBq6ZDZvaa	If it was a bad thermostat your engine would either never warn up or it would just over heat. It sounds like it could be a bad head gasket. check your oil if it smells like coolant than you know what the problem is also you can look at the bottom of the oil fill cap if their is white ish looking sludge on it than that's a sign of burnt coolant. If it where real bad than your car would have white smoke coming out the exhaust all the time and it would be coming out like a cloud like you were doing a burn out. if its not smoking than look at the engine to see if you see coolant any were and also check your carpet by the center console if its wet than it's your heater core. The heads gaskets realy don't go bad on 305's.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Seems like a blown head gasket, as you have to keep adding coolant.

If they are wet looking, then that is more and likely the case there as well.|`|yzZchHHTaa	Is it burning out the exhaust, white smoke?

Gravity bleed - do not pressure bleed.  You will observe massive amounts of air escaping.   Close the bleeder, repeat the procedure on the LH side. Pump the brake pedal between bleeds.

The pedal will eventually come up.<br>  <br>  ???<br>  <br>  Be patient, & do not pressure bleed, the pedal will eventually come up.<br>  <br>  ???<br>  <br>  Now that you have changed the Master Cyl. it would be a good idea to allow the rear brakes to flush.  Crack the bleeder on the RR & allow to drain until the fluid runs clear.  Repeat the procedure on the LR.<br>   Pressure bleeding will result in the brake fluid trapping microscopic bubbles. Look at the brake fluid as it drains from the bleeder. You will notice the fluid is not clear.  The bubbles will eventually dissipate, but it takes time.  That's why leaving it for a couple of hours, & then cracking the bleeder, you will see air escaping.<br>  <br>  ???

Since you are under 25.|`|1OmSZUvLaa	All additional drivers have to be registered and must complete and sign an additional driver form at the rental counter.

05f4e2fcc946201fdafdb6dd782f1f79aa	Infarto cerebral o tambien conocido como ictus:<br>  <br>  El ictus es prevenible si se tratan los factores de riesgo y se siguen buenos hábitos de vida. De este modo se podrían evitar el 70% de estos eventos y, en cambio, no lo conseguimos en más de un 40%”, estas son las conclusiones a las que ha llegado el doctor José Larracoechea, representante en Espa?a de la Sociedad Internacional del Ictus (ISS, sus siglas en inglés), tras conocer los resultados del estudio REACH, que ha demostrado que muchas personas con un riesgo elevado de sufrir un ictus o un infarto de miocardio podrían no estar recibiendo el tratamiento adecuado. Tales conclusiones, indican, según este experto, que “no se están haciendo bien las cosas”. <br>  <br>  En esto sentido y bajo el lema “Ictus. Reduce el riesgo ahora y en el futuro”, el ISS celebró este martes una jornada de sensibilización donde expertos de todo el mundo han hecho un llamamiento para que la prevención del ictus se convierta en una prioridad sanitaria, tanto para la población como para los profesionales. Y es que, este sector está convencido de la necesidad acuciante de campa?as de educación sanitaria que mejoren y aumenten el conocimiento sobre esta enfermedad y sus factores de riesgo. “Podemos disminuir significativamente el número de casos de ictus que se producen cada a?o, pero para ello es preciso impulsar la educación sanitaria sobre esta enfermedad hasta que la población identifique los factores de riesgo y adquiera unos hábitos de vida saludables”, concluye Julian J. Bogousslavsky, presidente de la ISS y profesor en la Universidad de Lausana, en Suiza. <br>  <br>  Reconocer los síntomas y acudir al médico<br>  <br>  <br>  Unos 15 millones de personas sufren un ictus cada a?o en todo el mundo, de entre los cuales, cinco millones fallecen y otros cinco quedan con alguna secuela discapacitante. Algunos estudios revelan que esta enfermedad cerebrovascular provoca más discapacidad y muertes prematuras que el Alzheimer y los accidentes de tráfico juntos. En Espa?a, donde es la primera causa de muerte en la mujer, se estima que casi un millón de personas ha sufrido esta enfermedad que, en cierto modo, sigue siendo poco conocida e infravalorada, pese a estar considerada una urgencia médica y una amenaza para la salud pública. <br>  <br>  Los especialistas continúan insistiendo en que la población debe conocer bien los signos de alerta para poder identificar el ictus y acudir a tiempo al hospital, principalmente porque, los mayores logros, en términos de supervivencia y recuperación sin secuelas, se consigue en las primeras horas de haberse producido el infarto: “Es preciso estar muy atento a síntomas, como la pérdida de fuerza o sensibilidad de medio cuerpo, la dificultad para hablar o entender, la pérdida súbita de la visión por uno o los dos ojos o la aparición de un intenso dolor de cabeza” aconseja Larracoechea. Aunque es obvio, que lo más aconsejable es prevenir el primer ictus, algo que está en manos de todos, ya que se trata de llevar una vida saludable, evitando o controlando los principales factores de riesgo de esta enfermedad: la hipertensión arterial, el tabaquismo y el colesterol elevado, junto con la edad, la diabetes, el abuso del alcohol, el sedentarismo y el tipo de dieta. “El control de todos ellos constituye la medicina más eficaz en la prevención del ictus”, concluye el representante espa?ol de la ISS. <br>  <br>  Tales consejos, que siguen pasando desapercibidos, no desmerecen atención, si se tiene en cuenta que, hoy día, el 15% de las personas que han padecido un ictus fallecerá o requerirá ingreso hospitalario en un periodo inferior a un a?o. <br>  <br>  Cómo reducir el riesgo de sufrir un infarto cerebral<br>  <br>  · Abandonar el tabaco.<br>  <br>  · Llevar una dieta rica en frutas, verduras, fibra, baja en sal y grasas.<br>  <br>  · Realizar ejercicio físico cinco días a la semana durante 30 minutos al día.<br>  <br>  · Controlar el peso.<br>  <br>  · Evitar el consumo excesivo de alcohol.<br>  <br>  · Si tiene más de 50 a?os, controlar de forma regular la presión arterial.<br>  <br>  · Cumplir con el tratamiento prescrito por su médico.|`|815263871533781e1194879d14787e31aa	Comiendo ajo.|`|feb90054f5a8e74d62eeba2ccf0544b4aa	Con ejercicio regular y menos stress|`|I6nopGJJaa	1-No comer nada frito(frituras, empanadas, milanesas)<br>  2-Evitar las grasas (Usa moderadamente aceite de oliva)<br>  3-Caminar en la ma?ana y despues de cenar (cena entre las 5:30 a 7:00)<br>  4-Manténte en el rango de tu peso (índice de masa corporal en inglés BMI).

The mechanic doesn't really know, until he has thoroughly examined the trouble spot. Sometimes there is a problem locating the proper repair part, and getting a decent price and warranty on it. If I were you and you are eventually happy with the services performed, I would exercise a litlle grace, and give the mechanic a gift to show your appreciation. Not everything goes as planned, cost-wise or time-wise. You didn't mention what kind of car this is, year, model, or even what kind of repair you are having done. If the car is older, sometimes parts must be heated to assist in removal, there are always surprises. Unless your mechanic has focused his career ONLY on your particular brand of car, he might need just a little more time. Good Luck!!

Und für die Ladungssicherung ist der Verlader verantwortlich. D.h. wenn Du den Container bel?dst, bist Du Verlader und Versender in einer Person. Wird der Container z.B. bei einer Spedition beladen, sind die Verleader (und somit für Ladungssicherung verantwortlich) und Du der Versender.<br>  Aber andere Frage: Wieso Europaletten?

H0IGR6ZXaa	I am an air traffic controller with the FAA. Hard to staff facilities are ones that are in high cost of living areas such as New York, California, Boston, Florida, etc. I believe you have a choice of five states to choose from. My advice, apply for all five states even if you do not want to go. Get your foot in the door then transfer to the state you want in three years. My advice to you, go to a low level facility first........if you have no ATC experience you most likely will get washed out and fired because you are not able to make it if you go to a big facility. Stick with level 7 or lower.|`|f62f84279f66c27518596919f0d61103aa	Atone is right and I'd also add Ohio to that list.  Don't go to a high level facility at first.  Work your way up.  I don't care how well you scored on a test or how good your grades in school were.  Once you get to your facility you have so many training hours and you either "get it" or you get fired.  No ifs ands or buts.  Try and get a smaller facility. learn how to do the job and then after you've checked out you can transfer and try your hand at some hot spot without fear of losing your job.  <br>  <br>  ARTCCs or "Centers" are all high level facilities, but they have all been designed around the idea that they take someone with no experience and they will spend their entire career there.  Terminal facilities like towers and approach controls were designed around the idea that you start out at a small facility then transfer your way up.  It used to be nobody would ever dream of picking someone with no experience for Atlanta or New York approach, but now they are.  And no they aren't succeeding.  Last I heard its been 3 years since anyone without prior FAA ATC experience checked out at Atlanta TRACON.  Probably 100 people have been sent there in that time period and I'd doubt many of them are still employed there.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Try Barbados.

Not from being an ATC.  If a student is good enough, can handle the training and stress they can pass no matter what level facility they start at.   I know ATCs that started with no experience at Centers and are still at it.  <br>  <br>  Again...to maximize your chances of getting hired apply nation wide.
4biGrjPkaa	Speak to the original sales woman and explain the situation to her, and tell her if the car you were promised isnt available for collection on the agreed date that she can cancel the order, cancel the finance and give you your money back. The finance agreement doesnt come into effect until the day you collect the car. Threaten to take your business elsewhere unless they smarten up their act (and be prepared to do so if they don't!). You are entitled to your deposit back if they are in breach of contract (they offered you the car with the extras and you accepted it - thats a contract!).<br>  <br>  You have rights under the law of contract but it's hard to prove what was said between you and the sales woman, you should have got an amended vehicle order form as proof of your agreement.<br>  <br>  You'd think in the current financial situation they'd be trying to keep their customers happy!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Oh and the garage is wrong, if you still want the car you ordered it has to be at the agreed price (again - Law of Contract). I take it you have that agreement in writing? To be honest they sound like a right bunch of chancers and if it were me I would be taking my business elsewhere at this stage.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	If you were told the extra items were to be free, then by all means they should be. Find the person who told you that and bring them into the office of the manager of the dealership. If you cannot settle it, walk away and go to another dealership. I seriously doubt that they will lose the sale over that amount. They are depending upon the fact that you really want the car. If you show them you can walk away and will, then they will back down.

I have a 2006 Honda Accord and I was looking through my manual and skipped across how to adjust your headlights. <br>  <br>  If you want the information on how to adjust your headlights for an '06, I will be more than happy to send you the information.

AA10409227	I would go for the Honda Fit Sport. Very reliable and better gas mileage than the Scion. Also, I think Honda gives you a lot more car for your money than Toyota (Scion). The Fit handles much better & is sportier. That would be the deciding factor for me. Toyota makes a good car, but they do not have the sporty demeanor of a HOnda.

4w4OU9Wjaa	Go to your local parts store and have them check the alternator to see if it is charging the battery.  You can check yourself with a $10 volt meter, red to pos black to neg with car running.  It should be puting out at least 13 volts or more.  If less replace your alternator and go back to the garage and get your money back for a miss diagnosis.

No option to change it into 2WD while driving. Cars and small SUV's.

My mom drives a pilot, and it has a computer that senses when she needs 4x4 depending on the terrain she's driving over....So it goes into 4x4. But, because it's a computer sensor doing it instead of having to manually lock the hubs and shift it into 4x4, I consider that to be more of an all wheel drive.<br>      As opposed to like our F-350 where you have to shift it into 4x4 after you lock the hubs, or for a nicer vehicle, push button 4x4.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	Everyone's got the differences covered.<br> <br> I just wanna add that its all basically the same since its extra weight makes you heavier from the added second drivetrain.  Also, with all the wheels engaged doesn't necessarily give you a bigger advantage in fouler weather, if at all.  Don't assume its gonna save you from a spin-out on slick roads going past 25 MPH.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	all wheel drive is just what it sounds like all wheels drive,four wheel drive you select two high or four high so only two wheels drive or four wheels drive at the same time.|`|DV4xyeChaa	AWD is on all the time...4wd can be on or off and should not be used on dry roads........awd best for road...4wd for off road|`|7mo6rplyaa	As it turns out, "all-wheel drive" refers to vehicles that have permanently engaged or automatically engaging four-wheel-drive capability. "Four-wheel drive" implies the vehicle has manually engaging, temporary four-wheel drive. Your confusion is justified -- the auto industry, in their infinite wisdom, created these seemingly interchangeable terms. <br>  <br>  What is four-wheel drive, exactly? According to a helpful 4X4 glossary* we jumped to from a link on Eliot's page, a four-wheel-drive vehicle has the ability to send power to all four wheels (not just the front two), giving the car more traction and stability. This helps when driving off road or on rough terrain. <br>  <br>  Some current all-wheel-drive vehicles on the market are the Oldsmobile Bravada, the Toyota RAV-4, and the Mercury Mountaineer. If you're trying to decide between the two systems, Eliot suggests all-wheel drive over four-wheel drive: less hassle, better suspension, and better overall design. But he has a lot more to say on the matter.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...
