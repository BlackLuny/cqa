20090226130701AAX1xfY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Unknown illness causing problems?	It's wrecking my eating routine and stressing me out!      Recently my stomach's been all over the place. I've been feeling nauseous on and off to the point i thought i was gonna be sick. Eating something simple like a bowl of cereal can give me indigestion and make me feel abnormally full.      I wouldn't be worried if it weren't for the fact it's been going on for about three weeks now, not all the time, but recurring, and it's starting to bother me.       I've also had breathing problems while sleeping, whether this has anything to do with it i have no idea, but lately i seem to have a strange sensation in my lungs while lying down which makes my breathing kinda laboured.      Thanks for any advice.

I suffer from Emetophobia and fear of germs. I wear disposable gloves for everything and only eat prepackaged food. As you can see the above symptoms cannot be food poisoning as I really not not touch ANYTHING outside the house and only eat precooked, prepacked supermarket ready meals. I have not been around any ill people and everyone else in the house is ok.      I did 3 miles on a bike yesterday (after not doing any exercise for quite a while), could this be the cause?      I have taken Pepto Bismol and ginger and this seems to have made me calmer. I also took a sleeping pill and have just woken up (7 hours later). I feel more relaxed.      I nearly lost a very good friend a couple of days ago which was very emotional, could this be the cause?      Can anxiety really cause this?

20090226145426AAca1fK	Health;Mental Health	Used to have a drinking problem - started drinking again today?	I'm 16 now (almost 17). By the time I was 14 I had been drinking around 3 - 4 bottles of beer every night. I did this on my own, usually while listening to music or chatting online. I wouldn't say I was an alcoholic, but I definately was drinking too often. My mother had no problems buying it for me, she drinks quite a bit every night herself (though not enough to get drunk!) and when I went to my dad's house he'd give me glasses of wine or beers as a ''treat'', not knowing I drink all the time at home.      When I just turned 16, my mother chucked me out of the house and I ended up in a homeless shelter. I started going out drinking every night with my ''friends'' - drinking more than I was before. Eventually, my mum invited me back into her house and I cut down a bit on drinking.      On new year's eve 2007-2008... I drank so much that I got alcohol poisoning. I ended up in hospital for a few days, couldn't leave the house for 3 weeks afterwards and didn't feel like drinking after that...      I stopped cold turkey, but yesterday and today I have started drinking again. I've only had one can of beer last night (2.5 units) and one can tonight... but I can already feel that familiar buzz. I just want to be buzzed all the time...      I'm worried I'm going down a dangerous path.

I woke up Friday morning with a few blisters on each wrist. Throughout Friday the rash spread to my leg then abdomen. By Saturday it had gotten worse so my family made me go to the ER. The ER doctors said it was maybe contact dermatitis or a virus. They gave me a shot, prednisone and stuff to help the itching. It hadn't gotten better by Monday but in fact had spread to my toes so I went to my doctor's office. My doctor couldn't see me so a nurse saw me, freaked out and sent me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist said she thought it was a drug allergy. I take a few medications for my headaches and back problems. She kept saying, "it's so diffuse that it has to be a drug allergy". It hasn't gotten better and I was googling, accidentally came across scabies and it looks like my rash. Now I am freaking out!!!!! I don't want to give this to my baby. Could my doctor miss scabies? I have dogs. I have read that dogs can pass it to humans and have also read that they cannot. We have had all of these squirrels dying in our neighborhood, is there a link? I can't possibly think of where else I could have gotten scabies. I also really want to know; does scabies spread that fast over your body?

I did it a couple of times over the spring, but never did the whole binging thing - just some very small meals. I stopped for all the summer.    But this spring it all came back. I never binge, I simply feel guilty about a bag of chips or a chocolate bar. Problem is, it could happen every day. I've never inserted fingers to induce the vomiting though, nor a toothbrush, not any other thing, I've done it only by adding a little pressure and if the food doesn't come back, I give up.   I have stopped again and have not noticed anything wrong with my teeth or gums or hair or complexion, but I keep wondering - can it show over time? Is bulimia something you add up over the years until it strikes?

Lately ever since june of last year I've been experiencing some problem with my sinus I think it might be an infection.      I think it could have come from the weed I've been smoking because it started when I would get high I would usually start hawking up alot of green phlegm and I would gag on it to the point were I would even vomit because of it.      I use to blow the smoke out of my nose I guess to look cool and I think I have an infection because of it. When ever I'm a sleep I wake up with tons of stinky green mucus in my throat and I'm hawking and spitting it up and blowing it out my nose EVERY WAKING SECOND OF MY LIFE!!      I tried everything from irrigating my nose with salt water, drinking hot tea with honey, apple cider vinager, I've been on 3 different allergy medicines, fluctose, prevacid for acid reflux and some other kind of medication.      Someone please help me I bullshit you not when I say this **** is eating away at my life, I can't do anything because of sinus headaches, fatigue for lack of oxygen and overall being sick and disgusted with this seemingly endless amount of gooey nasty, funky, mucus just pooring out of my sinuses.      I'm not sure if its post nasal drip but can someone please help me if you've dealt with this problem before!!!!!!

He also knows of my problems outside college and inside college, i am behind on work and have attempted suicide, he knows im a quiet lad who doesnt speak much, so when he said are you a bigtime charlie which means gangster or tough guy i think hes mocking me and when he said in the same sentance is it cause the girls always ring you that you never answer the phone, im far from a ladies man and below average looking so is he patronizing and mocking me with the others...........i also know my personal problems and myself have been discussed in the staff room...........PLEASE HELP 10 POINTS TO A GOOD AND DETAILED ANSWER..........THANKS

A few years ago the Ministry of Health delisted routine eye examinations.The exam was still covered for those under age 20 and over age 65. The exam prevented a lot of people from experiencing serious visual problems and prevented possible blindness.A lot of people can't afford health coverage beyond the O.H.I.P. program. .I think more people would be better served by having eye exams paid for than to make available approximately $50000. each for 1400 people to have the Bariatric surgery.I would like your input on this topic.I am not trying to be insensitive to the morbidly obese patient  but I question why this is covered by public money when many private carriers no longer cover it.

Everything low fat has carbs and everything low carb is bad for my cholesterol. What does one eat in this situation?      He said my liver is going haywire too. I asked why but he doesn't know. I have to see a specialist. What kind of doctor deals with livers? What would make someone's liver be working too hard? He said something about a number on my lab work that's supposed to be a 5 and mine is a 9. I don't drink alcohol very often and that's all I know that can hurt your liver.

Today I brought him to the doctor to have his knee checked and everything, and they numbed his leg to do some work on it. Now, he's at home with me and he fell asleep on the couch. He's hardly slept since he hurt himself, because it really hurts him at night and in the morning.

I don't want him to miss out on time that he could sleep, though... I feel so bad for him... What should I do? Wake him? Let him sleep? He needs the meds for his knee though... what should I do?

20090226130721AAZJFxc	Health;Women's Health	I can't be happy anymore?	My friends treat me terribly. The three of us used to be the best of friends. Now, my one friend Marina is sexually active with her boyfriend, and she is literally with him 24/7. I never see her, but when she is available, she invites my one friend and not me. She teases me, and she seems apathetic towards me and sometimes ignores me. My other friend, Jill, she dates some guy and went pretty far with him (for her that is) and he treated her like total crap, then dumped her a week afterwards. They dated a month, but she won't let him go. She broke up with a very good friend of mine, who would have given his life for her, now he's crushed. My family and I are fighting, two people my own age just died from my school...I hate my classes...I'm just so unhappy. I have no friends left. I need something to get me happy again..Sorry for complaining so much.
20090226135409AAABXEF	Health;Mental Health	SUICIDE PREVENTION EMERGENCY. please help me please?	have a lot of stuff going on in my life right now. ive told 2 of my friends whats going on. i dreamed that i killed myself a while ago. and i have depression and i am depressed and i know that. i keep thinking about suicide. and it keeps seeming like a better option everyday. i know how i would do it and i have everything i need. i don't want to kill myself really. like it would be so incredibly selfish and i know. but other than those 2 friends i hide my feeling from the people around me. i need help.i know i need help. but i cant bring myself to tell the people who would be able to help me. and if i did get help i would fight it. i just know how i am and its really stupid. i have like 8 different suicide hotline numbers and i do plan to call them. but i was wondering if there is like a similar thing over aim or some other instant messaging thing. basically its because if someone is talking in one room of my house everyone can hear them. which means i would have to go outside or something to call. but its late at night when i feel the worst, and i cant sneak out because of the alarm system which i don't have the code to. i need a way to talk to someone who can help me even just by listening without telling others and getting me locked up. please help. but it would be best if it wasn't on the phone. please help me i cant go to the hospital or mental ward now. ive got school and stuff and i would just fight the help they would give me

20090226134259AAKiA74	Health;Other - Health	My nose leaks when I bend over?	I'm a 32 year old female in pretty good health, other than mild asthma and some thyroid problems.  Over the last couple of months (at least this is when I started paying attention to this) my nose leaks when I bend over.  It is not snot, it is clear and as thin as water.  What could this be?  I have not suffered any head injuries so I do not believe it is a spinal/brain fluid leak.  When I bend over I feel it leaking into my nose and after a second or two drips of this liquid come out of my nose.  Not to be gross, but I tasted it to see what it was (knowing that it is not snot) and it tasted salty, almost like tears.  Does anyone know what this could be?  Is it serious?  I plan on talking to my doctor about it in the very near future.

20090226132504AAUdXzD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Have I spread Cytomegalovirus (CMV)?	My friend that I kissed about 4 weeks ago and she hasn't kissed anyone else and thinks she had mono because she has all the symptoms, but mono shares the same symptoms as Cytomegalovirus, a herpes-like virus. And I think if I might have herpes (I haven't had any cold sores, so i really don't know if I do). Does this mean that I could have Cytomegalovirus and have spread it to my friend?       The syptoms to Cytomegalovirus are fever, chills, sore throat, swollen glands, body aches, and fatigue. (like mono), but they can go dormant. So could I get Cytomegalovirus without knowing? Do the symptoms of Cytomegalovirus automatically emerge once you get it, because I have never had those symptoms before.      So basically- Do I have herpes or Cytomegalovirus or mono and have spread it to my friend? Because she just may have a sore throat.      By the way I'm only 16 so asking to go to the doctor is a little out of the question at the moment.

I will say it once, and do it again until it reaches ten, then do ten a second time, and begin counting down to zero, do a second zero and repeat.      It doesn't seem to be anything specific that sets it off, my mind just sees something it likes the looks of, and away it goes.

My diet usually consists of:      Breakfast   -cereal with milk      No Lunch      Snacks   - pretzels during the day or granola bars      Dinner   -usually some form of meat   -bread   -frozen/heated up vegetables   -milk/iced tea      How can I shed the weight when I can't really eat that healthy? And I don't necessarily work out all the time, but tennis at my high school will be starting soon meaning that I will be working out 2 hours everyday, 5 days a week. I'm 15 years old, and 5'5 or 5'6 somewhere around there and I currently weigh about 125 pounds. Any ideas??

20090226143634AAtI4yw	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Am I at greater risk for skin cancer? (sunburn)?	I'm 18, and I have always been one who is out in the sun. I played soccer every summer since I was 6, and majority of the time I never wore sunscreen and got many burns (especially on my face). At amusement parks (I had a seasons pass for many years) I would always get burnt. Basically I am very active outside in the extreme heat of the day and MANY times I have forgot to wear sunscreen and definetly paid for it.       I go away to the carribean once a year, and always get really burnt. I am now wondering what kind of burn I had while on vacations. It hurts (obviously), bubbles a bit, peels, chills, sometimes dizzyness/wanting to throw up. I never went to the doctor for any burn Ive got, but Im just concerned about getting skin cancer. I'm not a redhead, but I USED to have a few freckles around my nose when I was young. I have dirty brown hair and fair skinned.       Recently Ive been noticing Ive been getting very small brown dots (look like freckles) in random spots. I assume they have appeared because of sun exposure. I am almost certain they are not cancerous, but Im worried for when I get older.      Anybodys insight would be much appreciated?   Should I talk to my doctor, Im going to get my mumps shot sometime in March, but I feel a little silly asking because Im only 18.

He also knows of my problems outside college and inside college, i am behind on work and have attempted suicide, he knows im a quiet lad who doesnt speak much, so when he said are you a bigtime charlie which means gangster or tough guy i think hes mocking me and when he said in the same sentance is it cause the girls always ring you that you never answer the phone, im far from a ladies man and below average looking so is he patronizing and mocking me with the others...........i also know my personal problems and myself have been discussed in the staff room...........PLEASE HELP 10 POINTS TO A GOOD AND DETAILED ANSWER..........THANKS

It seems like everytime when i'm in a still position it hurts. it's actually hurting now. and it's exactly like my period would hurt like.. but that's the thing : no period... and i also feel rly bloated for some reason, as if i was fat, but i know i'm not. does anybody have an useful idea of y this is happeneing?

One of the medications his psychiatrist has prescribed in the last few months is clonazepam a controlled substance that I've read works on the brain in much the same way that alcohol does.    I thought it was a bad idea when I first heard they prescribed him something that can become addictive now that Ive read that it affects the brain similarly to alcohol I have to wonder if its beyond bad and just plain stupid.      Is this not just like taking away the bottle and replacing it with a pill?      Is there a time limit he should be on this medication or any other considerations etc due to the fact that he is an alcholic who just quit drinking?      To me it seems like the alcohol was replaced with a pill that affects the brain the same way and so what happens when and if the pill is gone what happens to his sobriety?       Should I contact his therapist with my concerns? Should I be concerned? Any information would be great

I drink green decaffeinated tea, and have water with flavor packets to vary up the flavor.      I hear that it's better for your system to drink cool to room temperature water because it's less shock to your system and it absorbs better.      But I also hear the opposite that you should drink cold water because your body actually burns calories heating it up before digestion.        So which is right?  Please provide links or suitable proof.

I am 21 and work in Finance So i recently had an anxiety attack caused by heavy stress, I was given Xanax which I stopped taking as I was becoming addicted to it. (I was on it for 2 weeks on and off) All my shoulders area and above my shoulders on my head near my brain are very like sore sometimes it hurts, just like when you have lots of stress and your shoulders hurt. So I went and got a massage and still the pain is there. I got a Vicks inhaler and every 10 mins I inhale a bit and that seems to relieve the head pain for like 30 mins, then its back up again (near my brain) that is causing my pain on my shoulders (the stress pain)  I came to conclusion that I am not breathing correctly how im supposed to so my brain is not getting enough oxygen which is causing me to have the shoulder pain (stress pain). Is this possible?   Can someone not breath appropriately and cause this type of pain? I’m very confused and shocked at the same time…. ANY help would be greatly appreciated all… ?      Please please ?

Review excerpts from medical books online, free, without registration, for more information about the causes of Kwashiorkor.    Protein-calorie malnutrition: Causes and incidence    (Professional Guide to Diseases (Eighth Edition))    Both kwashiorkor (edematous PCM) and marasmus (nonedematous PCM) are common in underdeveloped countries and in areas in which dietary amino acid    content is insufficient to satisfy growth requirements. Kwashiorkor typically occurs at about age 1, after infants are weaned from breast milk to a protein-deficient diet of starchy gruels or sugar water, but it can develop at any time during the formative years. Marasmus affects infants ages 6 to 18 months as a result of breast-feeding failure, or a debilitating condition such as chronic diarrhea.    In industrialized countries, PCM may occur secondary to chronic metabolic disease that decreases protein and calorie intake or absorption, or trauma that increases protein and calorie requirements. In the United States, PCM is estimated to occur to some extent in 50% of elderly people in nursing homes. Those who aren’t allowed anything by mouth for an extended period are at high risk of developing PCM. Conditions that increase protein-calorie requirements include severe burns and injuries, systemic infections, and cancer (accounts for the largest group of hospitalized patients with PCM). Conditions that cause defective utilization of nutrients include malabsorption syndrome, short-bowel syndrome, and Crohn’s disease.

20090226142441AAdFGx9	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	What is the difference between Codeine Sulfate, Codeine, and Hydrocodone?	I have chronic cough and muscle stiffness and pain often. I have been prescribed everything from Tylenol 3 (30mg Codeine and Tylenol) to Hydrocodone 10mg/1000mg.      I've noticed that codeine seems quite weaker than Hydrocodone. If I take 2 hydrocodones, the same feeling takes 3-4 codeine tablets to acheive the desired feeling.      Recently, someone told me I should try Codeine Sulfate (60MG), they are small white tablets and contain no Tylenol, Asprin, or Ibuprofen. If I take 2 of these, will they be more similar to Hydrocodone or the Tylenol 3's?         What is the difference between Codeine Sulfate, Codeine, and Hydrocodone?

20090226141650AA2ivYJ	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is this enough exercise to lose at least 1 or more pounds a week?	Okay, well I try to eat around 1300 calories per day of relatively healthy foods.      I do interval running on the treadmill at least 6 days a week, and I increase my goal number of calories to burn per session each week. Right now, I do interval running for about 30 min, burning 400 calories (I just adjusted this, it used to be 350 cal 2 weeks ago). So basically I warm up for 2 min, sprint 30 sec, speed walk at 4 mph, sprint, speed walk, etc.      I don't really have much time for any other exercise because I get a lot of homework and have to study, which sometimes forces me to skip a day's workout. I can occasionally go to the gym on weekends, and that'll burn more than 500 calories each time I go.      So basically my question is, is this enough exercise to burn at least 1-2 pounds a week (preferablly 2)? I want to drop 15 pounds (of fat) by April 15. So far I've lost almost 3 pounds (yay =P) so I've got 12 to go. Is this possible with my schedule?      If it helps, I'm 5'2 1/2'' and currently 122.5 pounds (I know I'm a healthy weight, but I just want a better figure).      Oh, and I have another question you can answer if you want to. Does speed walking at 4mph burn as many calories as slow jogging at 4mph? I know it probably doesn't burn quite as much because your heart rate doesn't go as high, but is it close? Like within 10 calories?      Thanks, any and all tips are appreciated also, and will make you more likely to get best answer.

Almost a week ago I was playing indoor soccer when I was sprinting and tried to stop the ball by putting my foot on top of the ball. My foot rolled off the ball and my knee bent outwards and I hit the ground very hard. I have been on crutches until the other day when I started walking around with a limp. I got x-rays which showed nothing and I saw the school nurse who thinks I have tendinitis (I think this a misdiagnosis). The ER told me it was a sprain. I can bend my knee to about 45 degree and straighten it for the most part but I can't lift it or bend it without some assistance. Should I be worried that I tore something or is it simply a bruise and sprain that will take some time to heal?

20090226140153AAxwO1x	Health;Optical	19 years old--Sudden, Temporary Loss of Vision?	I was in the computer lab today just working on some questions. Another computer user kept laughing so I put my headphones in to block out the sound of his laugh. When I got back to looking at my computer screen I noticed there was a little blurry spot on the screen. As I kept working, I would read in my book trying to find an answer and this blurry spot started to double in size until I could only see bits and peices of the paragraph I was trying to read in my book. I looked around the room and I could see parts of the room and the rest was blurry. It was like white/clear fireworks were constantly flashing in my eyes. I left the room and went to the restroom to see if there was anything in my eyes. I closed one eye at a time and the blur was still there. I went outside and walked right in front of a oncoming car because I could not see it from the side it came. After about 10 minutes my eyes were back to normal. It has now been 3 hours since that and I have had a constant migraine/headach behind my eyes, mainly behind my right eye.      I dont wear glasses or contacts. Any ideas??

Her symptoms were  not consitent from day to day-but included inability to recognize family members, inability to talk, believing she was still a little girl, and i was her Mom, and sometimes attacking family members.

About 2 days ago, I noticed that my right lower side hurt, especially when I walked. It doesnt really hurt when I lay down, but seems to hurt for a split second just a tad every once in awhile while sitting or lying down. Im also passing alot of gas, since the time it started hurting. I cant really see a difference like its getting any worse, it seems to be staying around the same. The pain isnt unbearable or particularly real bad either, but Im trying not to move around alot, and I went outside earlier to shoot some basketball, but the pain was annoying so I came back in. Im also still digesting like normal, and I still have my appetite, and no fever. What do you think the problem is? Appendicitus? Pulled muscle in my lower right side abdomen? Or just bad gas for the last 3 days? BTW My mom is going to the doctor tomorrow, so if its still hurting im going to tag along and get checked.  Just wonder what you all thought.  Thanks

I am certainly a man of the world and very open minded but why is it when you offer something like a massage with adverts all you get is weirdo's wanting much more than a massage? I know the deal with the stigma because of certain peoples activities, but when you make it plain and simple you need case studies for a recognized college course, why does that seem to go over these creeps heads to think they can get much more.    Does it boil down to saying i just want to work on ladies? if that's the case then that makes me look like the creep who just wants to get my hands on women in the adverts doesn't it?!

Have you noticed Muslim health workers not using the hand gel?my sister was in hospital recently, and she noticed that some members of staff never used the hand sanitiser gel, when she asked why, she was told that the Muslim workers refused to use it because it was alcohol. Surely this is unacceptable when hospital acquired mrsa etc is such a huge problem      I know they're not supposed to drink it, but  I've been to Muslim countires and  it's used widely, and the benefit of the whole community is important so what's the problem in Europe? Don't their co workers, and the hospital managers take action - either it's important or it's not.

20090226145448AA0z64X	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Blood in mucus, sputum, or spit. Not coughing?	Hi.  Just recently I am seeing blood spots and streaks in the mucus or sputum coming out of my throat.  I have more spit in the morning with the bright red blood.  It has been going on for about 4 days now ever since I traveled from LAX to Amsterdam.  I'm not sure if I want to see a DR. in Amsterdam as I return to the States in only 2 more weeks.  I feel fine though,  no breathing problems, am running 20 mins on the treadmill and doing well.  No coughing or heavy breathing, no nose congestion, no body aches or flu like symptoms....so what is wrong with me to have blood come up?      I was in India about 5 months ago and did catch bronchitis there due to the pollution and got better after all the meds and amoxicilan.  Once I got back to Los Angeles I saw a Pulmonary doctor who ran all kinds of tests and chest xrays and they came back saying nothing was wrong with me and my infection was gone.  Since that (Nov. 08) time till now (Feb. 09) I've had no such problems, no cold, no cough, nothing.      So now all of sudden when  get on a plane and travel for business again I just don't understand why I'm spitting up blood in my mucus again.  This is definitely not bronchitis.  I called my Pulmonologist from the States and he thinks its a broken blood vessel and told me to wait for 2-3 more days.  Any ideas on what you think this is?  Should I be really alarmed, I feel fine though...no headaches nothing.  Had all my shots Tb, hep, all up to date.        Any idea how to stop the blood?  I'm eating alot of honey, drinking lots of water, and continuing to work out to track my breathing.  Any idea how long this broken blood vessel and blood in my mucus will last - how many more days?  (It's been 4 days now)      Any advice would help - email ucsbnikey@yahoo.com      Thanks.  Nikey.

I was just checking out Fresh look Color blends website, and this is what I read      " Will Fresh Look color contacts really change my dark brown eyes?    Yes. Opaque contact lenses are specifically designed to change the color of brown eyes. Currently there are more than 3.2 million Fresh Look wearers who report great satisfaction with their eye color change. Colors for dark eyes are: Fresh Look Color Blends? Blue, Gray, Green, Honey, Pure Hazel, True Sapphire, Amethyst, Turquoise, and Brown; for a subtle, natural change. And Fresh Look Radiance? Autumn, Sunrise, Moonlight, and Eden; to brighten your eye color without changing it."      I know wearing colored contacts makes it look like you have a different color of eyes, but with Colorblend is it true that with extended use your eyes will actually get brighter/change a little form your natural?

I don't have a huge problem with massive overeating in which dieting feels foreign to me.      However, sometimes I feel like a bottomless pit. I eat all the things they say should fill you up--like I can eat bowl after bowl of high fiber cereal sometimes! I eat fruits and veggies, whole grains, etc. I feel like if I don't eat every couple hours, I'm soo hungry! It goes in phases I think -- sometimes I can eat the right amount and be ok, but for a couple weeks in a row I can eat and eat and eat.      Should I just tell my stomach to shut up and eat the "right portion" of food, or keep eating until I am satisfied? Not over-stuffed of course, but satisfied.

My parents back then could not afford to have it filled, and I basically just left it alone.  I'm already 26 years old and the hole has gotten bigger to a point where I can fit the tip of my tongue in it.  It has not bothered me except when I gargle using a mouthwash, it feels very sensitive as though the nerves are already exposed.  I don't have a very good dental plan, so I am planning on saving up for whatever procedure I will need.  The molar is still intact.  Do I need a pupal therapy for this, or will a simple filling solve it?  I need any advice I could get.  Thank you in advance!

However on a Sunday it is usually more like midday. No one else I know sleeps as much as I do and it really annoys me. you are meant to feel fresh in the morning from getting some sleep and I wake up feeling more tired than when I went to sleep in the first place. I sleep straight through and I am not often disturbed. However it really annoys when I can go through lessons at school in a daise because I am slowly nodding off and then when I get home thats it - 6 hours of school, zombie like through the evening and back into bed. I feel like I am a slave to sleep and struggle to get up in the mornings. Before anyone asks, I weigh 8 stone, eat a balanced diet and go to the gym once or twice a week. I am also taking iron tablets but they don't seem to be helping. Also when I go to bed I often get headaches but the iron seems to have helped that.

I wouldn't have like potatoes or bananas or anything. I would just have like carrots and apples and those types of fruits. Is this good? Could I lose 20 pounds on it?

20090225113451AA6FzOF	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	A career in ecology with fibromyalgia?	I was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia and after talking with my rheumatologist and speaking with my student services, I found out that I cannot do the career I originally wanted to do, conservational ecology (I think that was the title, it's usually a monday to friday desk job but once every couple months you go up north to monitor caribou herds and bird migration, one of my friend's dads does it) as it involves a lot of travel on foot/hiking. I still want a job in ecology, preferably working with land animals as opposed to plants or marine creatures, but I'm just wondering what options I still have. My entire body hurts constantly and I'm only 16; I can't lift anything excessively heavy,  can't run or jump, can't walk up an incline for very long, I'm pretty messed up but I still want to have a career with some ecological impact. So the crippled hippie's question in a nutshell, is there any ecological career that can be done by a fibromyalgic?

20090225113402AAqSRKr	Health;Mental Health	Are these things I should watch out for, or am I just paranoid?	I'm seeing a new guy. But something about him just rubs me the wrong way. I mean, I like him. He's gentlemanly, won't let me pay if I take him out. We seem to have a lot in common. Anyway, here's a list of things that kind of...bother me.      I'm becoming reluctant to hang out with him, because he's constantly trying to kiss me. A few times is ok, but if we're at the movies, if we're on a date, or if we're just hanging out talking, it's like he *needs* to be kissing me every 5 minutes. We've been dating about 2 weeks now.      We were just talking, and we were like 2 or 3 feet apart, and he asks why I'm so far away. Literally 90% of the time, he wants his arms around me. Which is nice...in moderation.      When he does start kissing me, if I gently push him to break the kiss, he sometimes doesn't respond.      He said he planned to see me today. But this is how he asked: "I'll be outside your house at 10:30. Ok?" I really didn't like that, and just canceled on him because I have much studying to do. Anyway, what do you think?

Basically, i was training a year or 2 ago on the heavy bag, and i punched the bag and my wrist folded,  since then my wrist has been kind of weak, at first it was kind of painful, couldn't do much, then about a month or 2 it got better but was always weaker, but i could still punch things, so it wasn't too much of a problem.      But when this guy asked me to punch him about 3 months ago (he was a 10th dan goju ryu karate instructor he wanted to demonstrate something), i punched him so hard, but my wrist and my thumb KILLED afterwards, that went on for a week and felt a little better, but felt as if it was damaged afterward.

Also i cant to underhand pull ups, i can do overhand with no problem, but underhand hurts on the inside side of my wrist.      Can someone please offer some light onto the situation?

20090226150116AAEC6r1	Health;Mental Health	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality.       How can the infinite pains of life be justified in comparison to the calm serenity of nonexistence? Has any man in history lived a life so blessed as to outweigh the pleasures of endless dreamless sleep? Is not man's greatest sin to have been born? What duty is there to continue to live? We did not choose to be born.      Why pass on genes, and sentence another generation to hell for the selfish pleasure of sexual desire?      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.      So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

It only last for like a few seconds, but it’s such a stinking pain that it stops me dead on my tracks. And this happens repeatedly in one day.        I did my research and I didn't see anything about cluster headaches doing that. But, I could be wrong.       My question is...   Is this stinting pain due to cluster headaches and if not, what other possible things can it be? Also, what can I do?      Another thing I should add is I have been coughing up blood. Not sure if it's related, but... just thought I would put that out there. It's not a lot though. Just a little spit up of blood when I cough.

My son's babysitter gave my son about an ounce and a half of chocolate pudding around an hour ago now.

He seems sleepy but fine so I did bring him home and lie him down (although I am monitoring him from across the hall). He has no hives or wheezing but I am deathly afraid of food allergies because I have a terrible one to bananas and carry an epi-pen because even the smell can cause some anaphylaxis in me, but it is always immediate. I have called his pediatrician and the hospital and they have both told me they can't give me advice over the phone. Should I take him to the ER or immediate care center just to be safe, or is that overreacting? I mean, I do have an epi-pen in the house and live 5 mins away from a hospital.

20090226154616AARhKGf	Health;Mental Health	Why am I so tired all the time?	I started getting tired around 8:30 when I started soccer in the end of November, and since then (even though soccer ended almost two weeks ago) my bed time has gotten earlier and earlier until it is about 7 lately, and it was 6:30 last night! I am too tired to stay awake and do my homework, so often times I wake up around 2:30 in the morning and finish and go back to sleep (my body somehow knows that I need to wake up as soon as I have enough energy to do my homework) but even when I haven't woken up i the middle of the night and gotten consistent sleep for a few nights, I fall asleep at like 7:30 the next night (I used to be able to make it until around 10:30 or 11:00 easily). What could be wrong with me!?!? All I do is go to school and come home and fall asleep doing my homework! Should I go to the doctor!? thanks so much!!!

20090226094145AAnzRs0	Health;Men's Health	Why am I about the only one around me who gets injured easily, was I chosen by Nature/God to be this way?	I don't know.. i've had many injuries before and i try to learn from it and be more careful but aparently i keep getting injured and almost nobody around me ever has any injuries. i'm not talking abut me being a guy into competitive sports! No.  I'm just a simple person, yes i do exercise but not the risky kind.      this are some of the stupidest, easiest ways i got injured and its like i didn't even do much and i'm injured for life      -1998 tried a back bend..chest ligament snapped and now i can't even do much pushups.. i have to be real careful. I'm ok now but if i try to do alot with my chest( hard punching or pushups) it hurts to death      -2000 ran a little.. my knee ligament badly damaged and it's been 9 years i stil have it bad.. But i'm used to it   -2001 to 2004 Various chestt pains where i felt like dying.   -2004 some serious male problems when i got injured by doing nothing, i just woke up one day from my sleep and i was like dying. took  1 year to heal      -2005 lost my normal hearing just because i played ONE drum sound on the Yamaha keyboard. It's not just tinnitus, it's a worse thing called hyperacusis.         -2006 Ate something and had a terrible stomach ache, went to emergency ...was about to be operated..but luckly they said no and then got better   -2007 Lifted some simple File folders and my shoulder ligament broke.    -2008 Did one slow, just for practice Karate spin kick and my knee meniscus tear   -2009 Just in February 9th, ate a salad and it had to be that bit down and the crouton was hard and it did something to my molar. It's hurting everyday for 3 weeks and i think it's broken.      You see! I get injured by anything even if it's alittle move that almost nobody gets injured by.      Recently with my possibly damaged molar tooth, i've been depressed and always thinking "Here we go another dumb injury"..       I dont know how to stop getting injured easily.. what can i do?      I try to think before i do things but it's like my mind just does it before thinking. i'm 29 male by the way

20090226095531AA4zPAF	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	How long/often should you use an ear bulb?	I went to a doctor because my ear hurt and couldn't hear out of it. He tried to syringe my ear but he didn't get anywhere with it. He suggested I use Debrox and come back in a few days.      I used it as instructed for 3 days and then used the ear bulb that came with the drops. A huge piece of wax came out and I was able to hear again. The next morning I used it again just to be sure and an even larger piece came out! I thought that my ear was fine the first time after I used the bulb, but obviously I was mistaken.      I rather not go back to the doctor because I have no insurance and I had to pay out of pocket for the 1st visit where he didn't do anything, but write a prescription for antibiotics (in case I had an ear infection since he couldn't even see in there).      So how do I know if my ear is fine? Should I try to use the drops/ear bulb again? Or should I just go back to the doctor?

20090226095541AAVU3oi	Health;Diet & Fitness	Help with shin pain - beginning cardio program?	I just began a cardio program this week.  (I'm 40 pounds overweight)       I'm doing interval training on the treadmill (3.2 low / 4.2 high) which I;m walking.  My left shin is heated, painful and feel like it will burst.      If I keep doing this interval intensity, will this shin pain go away the more I do this?  or does it mean I need to stretch more?  Should I begin at a lower intensity and build up?  How can I prevent this awful pain?  It's only bad on my left leg - so I guess I'm walking harder on that side.        Luckily - after doing the cardio I do not feel soreness in the shin - so I guess it is not yet shin splints.        Any thoughts and advice?  Thanks!

Sometimes i try to get more sleep but when i do i am more tired. Last night I went to bed at around 11 and woke up at 7:45 but I am already tired. It just seems like if I get the right amount of sleep I'm more tired than when I dont. Is it normal just because my body isnt used to it?
