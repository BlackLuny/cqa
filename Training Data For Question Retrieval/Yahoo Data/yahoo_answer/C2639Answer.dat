G9fTHtJfaa	Your wrong about the amps. They are the same brand and therefore, essentially, the same quality. However, they are different models, and like you said in the detail portion of your question, they offer different amounts of power. 1300 and 1100 watts rms. The thing you need to decide is which one is the best fit for your subwoofer(s). Hifonics is a good brand for amps though. IMO if your subs can handle it then i'd go with the 2008D. $60 for an extra 200 watts isn't that bad.     On the plus side with a stronger amp. You can always adjust the gain so that it will fit your subs wattage more precisely and you won't risk blowing them.    I hope this helps and good luck!
Bl9zcqxQaa	If you turn the wheel while driving and the noise changes, yes, I agree, its probably a wheel bearing, which is sold as a hub assembly.   Be best to have someone diagnosis it for you to make sure what side its coming from, as they are expensive and you might not want to do both if only one is bad.   Costs can vary, labor is usually around 100 dollars and the part can be around 150-250, per side,depending on the quality of the part, remember, cheaper isn't always better.    I agree, if you decide to do it in yourself, it would be a lot cheaper, but shops like all businesses mark-up the part , selling parts at cost will put a shop out of business real quick,  Good luck|`|skfHV92caa	Front wheel bearing jobs for that car could run about $300 parts and labor for one side.  The wheel bearings usually cost about 90 bucks each.|`|N4IGdJXwaa	That sounds like a bad wheel bearing to me.  You can purchase new wheel bearings for the front at http://mibearings.com/paypalparts/513137...  They are $84 a piece.  Labor (unless you are going to do it yourself) is from $70 to $150 an hour and it generally takes about an hour for one bearing.  I hope that helps!|`|a8m3HdDHaa	You need to take it to someone who knows what  they are listening to before you waste your money on parts that don't fix the problem.

skfHV92caa	Sometimes removing the dashboard can become a tricky ordeal.  But some basic pointers would include disconnecting the battery due to the airbags, removing the kick panel, removing the steering column, center console if equipped, removing panels to access hidden screws, removing bolts that hold the dash to the firewall, disconnecting electrical connectors, and finally removing the dashboard.  This process can be time consuming and may require assistance to remove.  For an inexperienced person, this job could take a several hours or several days.  For an experienced person, it could take an hour or two with assistance to remove.  I would say be careful that you get all bolts and screws or else you could end up with broken pieces.  It can be done if you have the time and patience.  Good luck.
4b38d97174c949f1f13c222090982820aa	ok before doing anything, double check the level in the bottle, after its full smack the bottle with a hammer handle or a short bat like it. then start the car to see if the lights out.|`|Bl9zcqxQaa	Its a common problem on those cars.  You can try one thing, otherwise if the coolant is full, you will need to replace the overflow tank, as the sensor is sold with the tank as one unit, its not sold seprate.    When we get a bottle that is empty and we need to fill it, even after its full, the light will stay on, one trick that sometimes works is to take a rubber mallet, or even your fist and with the fluid full in the tank, bang on it a few times. There's a float in the bottom that sometimes sticks down with crud that's built up in the tank over the years and makes the float stick if empty.  Tapping or banging on the tank sometimes frees it up and allows the float to pop back up where it needs to be.  That trick might save you on having to buy a new tank.  Good luck|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s probably just the temperature sending unit acting up.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	I had that happen on a 94 grand am and the coolant sensor gets dirt in it as it's on the bottom of the overflow tank, try taking a rubber mallet and smack the overflow tank a couple of times and that will free the dirt from the sensor and the light should go out.|`|AA10562288	Try  this , turn on the ignition but dont crank the engine.  Now pump the gas pedal three times then start the car.  The light should be off.  It works for me .|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Could be a bad sensor.  Find the sensor and take the plug out then bridge the plug with a piece of wire and see if the light goes out.  If it does then you have the problem if not it may be a code for some reason, you can try and disconnect the ground on the battery for a few minutes and see if it re-sets it.|`|skfHV92caa	I've found that on GM cars that if the coolant runs low in the radiator it causes the sensor to fail and cause the coolant light to come on.  The coolant level sensor is mounted in the radiator on the passenger side.  If you are standing in front of the car, look down on the right side of the radiator (where the fans are mounted) and you will see a sensor that is mounted in the radiator.  This sensor will have to be replaced.  If you have a temperature gauge, you could unplug the sensor to make the light go out.  If you were low on coolant, I would suggest you check to see if your lower intake manifold is leaking (especially if you have a 3.1L engine).  The coolant had to go somewhere.  Good luck.|`|tlue10gAaa	Another possibility is that air got in the system and an air bubble has caused the coolant light to come on (sensing low or no coolant). Look on the top radiator hose by the engine for a brass bolt. One can loosen the bolt, start the engine, turn heater to hottest setting and allow air to escape from the system. Keep in mind some fluid will also discharge. Do not do this with a warm or hot engine.    I replaced a thermostat on my Buick and that is what caused my coolant light to come on.
499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	you press the clutch and go to neutral , let the clutch out while it's in neutral then press the clutch again and go into the gear you want next. it' s easy when you get used to it.     you take your foot of the gas when you depress the clutch,but i can't remember whether you blip the gas when you're in neutral|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Before vehicles had syncro mesh gearboxes every body had to double d clutch to change gear in order to bring the engine speed--first motion gear into a compatible speed with the other gears so as not to grind them.You youngsters are spoilt today with all your home comforts lol|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Double clutch is exactly that - pressing the clutch two times in a row. It used to have to be done when manual transmissions were not synchronized so that you didn't make a thrashing sound when trying to get the vehicle into gear. Some trucks still have to be done that way because the transmissions are not synchronized. There is absolutely no reason to do it in a car.|`|QomVD1ceaa	It will do more damage than the clutch. Double clutch means you have to shift from a gear to neutral to another gear. possible bad sequencers|`|WAGpAh8oaa	2 different things. a double clutch car is you have to change gears but there is an automatic clutch (ie paddle shifts) dual clutching is when you push in the clucht put in Neutral, rev it push the clutch back in and shift in the next gear then let the clutch go but it should be done as fast as possible it shouldnt mess anything up cause your in neutral when you rev it|`|ImgouTRIaa	Double clutching is actually an anachronism, it hails from the old days before synchromesh transmissions,( when you actually had to know how to drive and handle a machine, not use the cell phone and just point the car.) In the old days , the gears in a manual transmission were not synchronized, and they would grind when you attempted to shift from one gear to another. To shift smoothly and avoid chewing up the gear teeth , what you needed to do was stab in the clutch as you went from say 2nd gear, release the clutch , and then clutch again as you go for 3rd to smooth the transition from gear to gear.  Today's transmissions are all synchromesh type and do not need to be "double clutched", with a little skill, you can shift WITHOUT the clutch by matching engine RPM's to gear speed inside the transmission. To answer the other part of your question( popping the clutch) regarding damage to the clutch , yes you can wreck it, especially factory stock clutches in front wheel drive or econobox type cars, they are not built to take an a$$whipping. You can get beefed up clutches from the aftermarket to install in your car, strong enough that you could blow the transmission before the clutch itself would fail. It's all fun stuff.|`|doeg7JSaaa	Double-declutch gear changing was an advantageous method of gear changing practised many years ago which made the change smoother and quicker in the pre- sincro days, but modern cars have gear boxes and clutches so much more superior as to make the practise completely obsolete.   This method of gear changing was looked on as the hallmark of a good driver but would now be viewed as someone out of touch and lacking vehicle sympathy.|`|VcNkM26jaa	do you mean double declutching if so before syncromesh gearboxes  were invented double declutching was essential.|`|pfIMUMwVaa	i passed my h.g.v class 1 licence way back(!!)in 1995 in a ford cargo with a 8 speed twin splitter box which had to be double decluthched,but you had to do it at the right revs or you missed the gear.The clutch pedal was VERY heavy,so after an hours lesson you were knackered.but the principle of it was  pull away in first get revs upto 1200,dip the clutch,quickly into neutral,dip clutch again and bang it into second.all the time you were driving you were using the rev counter more than anything.on down changes you had to blip the throttle in between to get the revs back up to engage the gear not like nowadays with all this electronic rubbish which selects the best gear for you,and all you do is sit and steer,and who knows how long it will be before thats taken awy from you!!!
AWDW78ESaa	If you have been going to a shop for years and they've treated you well, then go there. Otherwise look for a good mechanic through websites that rate them and friend recommendations. Do not ever take your own parts to the mechanic. Let him install his own. That way if something goes wrong, whether it's the parts or the labor, it's his problem to fix it. If you provide the parts and something goes wrong, he can blame the parts you provided and not do anything.|`|c48nm70gaa	CHB You have many well thought out legitimate concerns that have crossed the minds of many at one time or another.    I would hesitate to advise any person to have dedicated mechanical items and specialized services on a relatively new car no other place than a new car dealer. That goes for regular oil changes also.     Be careful of low dollar suspension, brake and tire care. Read tire reviews on tirerack.com. Make decisions about tires for your average year round driving.     It's not often who fixes your car but the quality of parts.    autopartswarehouse.com, partstrain.com and rock auto.com have quality parts.    Stay away from chain brake shops. They often corner you into brake rotor replacement and hand over inexpensive Chinese junk parts and charge exorbitantly. They gladly have their fat hand out for top dollar prices for off-shore parts when you could have had American or Canadian items.    As a rule private independent mechanics have more on the ball than do chain stores also.    Who gives a crap about restrooms, internet and magazines. I'd rather have more knowledgeable people working on my car and *my choice of parts.    Many new car dealerships allow you to carry in your own specific parts as long as they're not box store junk off-shore items.    Cary in your favorite brand engine oil at any new car dealership. They'll install it for you and the work will be done by trained certified mechanics.|`|wFlObEjcaa	if its minor maintence then i just go to the chain shops like firestone, wal-mart or whatever, if its major i go ASE certified and ones with no BBI complaints, ask the mechanic alot of questions so he knows what hes talking about,|`|4b38d97174c949f1f13c222090982820aa	first 17or18 then 9. ask around look for somebody who's mechanic is well experienced and has a strong buisiness, has a good memory and is borderline OCD. stay away from chains, mexicans, dirty back alley shops, and anyone with 2 or more bad reviews in a year.|`|WlUWpJfPaa	Save your self the trouble take it to the dealership, some people and companies will offer lower prices, but most rance from 80-90/hr of labor, and you can bring your own parts to a dealership, but it never hurst just to get a friend to give it a look, and maybe guide you on the right direction.You cannot go wrong, and try your owners manual maybe it might be something you can do your self, most imporant follow the owners manual suggested servicedates & the proper action for each case. Preventive maintenance is all it takes, happy driving hope this helps.
aqlvIbfHaa	I've also found that larger companies, like U- Haul, won't rent a pickup or cargo van one-way. U-Haul has a 10 ft. size truck that I used once to move across town. I didn't think I would fill it up all the way but I did.  It is probably advisable to rent a larger truck than you think you need. I have had numerous good experiences with our local U-Haul. U-Haul also does truck sales. I've never tried the self-pack container boxes but they could make sense if you have the room to leave the box and you're in a good neighborhood.    Good luck with the job search and your move!|`|dab68154eac09d5ab46a467c8e3bea85aa	I have found that before you decide to pay a moving van to move your belongings you need to evaluate what it is you are packing.  If the furniture you are shipping can be replaced for less than the moving van then it might be a good idea to have a big garage sale and sell off most of what you have and replace it when you get to your new city.  That will allow other options on how to get there, either by flying, driving your vehicle with what you have left, or shipping your vehicle.  If you decide you want to ship your vehicle check us out on the web and I'll give you a good deal

bO0vOyfZaa	yeah you need the cap... it maybe low on fluid...|`|zOIgzIy4aa	yes you need that cap because that,s what controls the temperature of the engine along with the thermostat. just get 1 from the junk yard. it probably won,t cost anymore then a couple of bucks.|`|mckmcmBSaa	The cap seals the system and with out it, the system will not     build up pressure.   Water boils at 212 degrees but under 16 lbs     of pressure the boiling point rises to about 260.  This is why, with     the cap, your car can run at 220 degrees ( which is normal)     without over heating.    ASE Auto Tech  9yrs|`|S9LQsdV8aa	Yes, get the cap back on their or you'll face bigger problems down the line.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	WHY....because you lost the cap and your pressurized coolent system is spilling anti-freeze all over the road so it isnt getting to your engine, instead little bunnie foo foo is licking it up. w2g|`|AWDW78ESaa	When your car is running, it heats up. When the antifreeze gets hot, it expands and needs a place to go otherwise the pressure build up will cause damage. The radiator cap prevents it from just boiling out the top of the radiator and channels it into the reserve tank so the engine can draw it back in when it needs it. If it boils out the top then you get low on fluid and the car overheats. So yes the cap is important and you do need it.|`|bmc8VzTPaa	The radiator cap is needed to keep pressure in the cooling system. The pressure in your cooling system is what keeps it from overheating.|`|6FoiK0bFaa	yes you need a cap to keep air out of your system because the cooling system is meant to be sealed. if not it will over heat.|`|YnXggliYaa	Yes your radiator builds pressure when your engine gets hot and the cap holds the pressure in and w/o it you might be leaking fluid and your radiator cant cool your engine very well

AA10620246	All Subaru models (past and present) have AWD. They handle great, do very well on slick roads, and the new ones seem to be pretty nice.

Bl9zcqxQaa	So the truck will stay running if you keep your foot on the gas?   If so, this may sound strange, but if might just be a weak battery.  On dodges, when the batter y is weak or if the battery goes dead or is disconnected, the vehicles will not idle. When we change a battery on a dodge, when done, we hook up a scan-tool to the computer system and "re-learn" the idle.   If we dont, it will just keep stalling out and have no idle.   Its part of the idle programming in the computer.    The old GM "W" body cars in the early 90's used to do the same thing.    I would need more info on your problem, but that would be my first thing to check, since it acts up more in cold weather when its putting more of a strain on your battery then in warmer temps.  Good luck|`|QW6Q74Vuaa	it seams that almost all problems no mater how different they may be the answer will always come to a bad battery. there may be just enough power to deceive you but likely as not there is not enough umph to start or stay ruining with out the alternator doing its part. just dirty terminals will cause more problems than you think. always check the condition of a battery first to start the process of elimination.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	your distributor cap might be drawing damp from the cold weather. when the motor is cold and check the inside of the cap and see if you see moisture.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	Sounds like a sensor  might be inoperative

The symptoms were at first a sort of whirring noise, which then becomes a rubbing droning noise. It did not affect the feel of the steering, at all, but was very annoying. <br>  If you do decide to change the pump, it is not cheap. I did mine myself, as I was a mechanic for 15 years and I paid ￡300 for each pump! Mine is a non VVTI version (1999) so depending on your car, it may not be relevant?<br>  My reason for spending this sort of silly money, were down to the simple fact, that the car is worth the money, due to overall greatness!
AA11264416	well are you talking about stock rims or aftermarket? but the bolt pattern on the dodge is 8 on 6 1/2 and then bolt pattern on the ford is 8 on 170mm, im not sure if they would match but even if they did you have to look at the backspacing, offset, width and if the rim can clear the rotor and caliper, what you could do i call up a tire shop or custom shop and they should tell you or find out for you|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Why would you put nice quality parts from Dodge on a POS ford? ohh thats right ford already does that from the factory.|`|FFUpnfq4aa	Thats the BEST truck you can buy. ford invented the heavey duty truck so they know what theyre doing.  <br>  <br>  .

5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Not likely.    When the govt. took over the passenger rail service it was with the rail companies blessings- they were losing lots of money on it.    The whole idea behind Amtrak when it was formed was to get rid of passenger rail service within a few years.    The director didn't take his job seriously enough and it survived.   Since then, there have been directors that helped and directors that did their best to drive Amtrak into the ground.    In a recent issue of the magazine Trains, there is an article on how Amtrak could be fixed, along with its history.   When I took the train across the country in the late '70's we went through Salt Lake or Denver, so were pretty close to WY if we didn't actually go through it.   That route has been cut out I think.

r1D9P4Vyaa	It sounds like you are doing your part, but it could be a few things here, The weather, you did not say where you live but colder weather will cause the ECU (computer) to adjust for a more rich fuel mixture and you will loose mileage do to that. also driving habits, are you the only one driving it? Of course the jack rabbit starts on take off will hurt it. It will not have anything to do with the coolant. Bad fuel can effect it some but not as much as yours dropped. I drop about 3-4 mpg`s in the winter here in northern MN just do to the cold. And I do not start the car to let it warm up even do to it is in a heated garage. Are you living in a cooler climate during the winter? If so then that must be it. I hope this helps some. Good Luck.<br>  Ps.  do check it with the tank fills with the trip meter re-set when you get to the next fill and do the math to verify what your panel is saying.<br>  Pss I wish you had stated the year/make/model of what you are driving and how many miles on it.|`|HUluAQM3aa	It has lost 5 mpg over how great a time period. 6 months?<br>  If I drove the car like an old man the mpg's would increase compared to someone who is hard on the engine.<br>  <br>  Fuel filter is not an issue.  If the engine is getting fuel it's getting fuel.  Period.  However, check the recommended replacement interval just the same.  Most vehicles come due around 120k.<br>  <br>  Try driving it a bit easier and see if that helps.<br>  Remove a few plugs to check their condition and to ensure they have equal coloring.  Too dark may be an indication of too rich a fuel mixture.|`|dSojErmBaa	When did you do the oxygen sensor last? because if its old it could be telling the car to throw in more gas with the air. what it does is regulate how much gas to air should mix together.

AA10531094	The first step that you will need to take to remove that old presidential bumper sticker from your car is to soak the sticker with WD-40. Spray a liberal coating and allow it to set for around twenty seconds. Take your finger and try to peel off the sticker, but if this doesn't work, it's time to pull out the big guns.    Take your blow dryer and place it five inches away from your bumper sticker. Turn it on high and leave it there for around two minutes. After you have heated the sticker with the blow dryer, you will take your finger and gently lift up the corner of the sticker. Once the corner has been lifted, take your spatula and slowly move it forwards, lifting up the sticker. You may need to assist the sticker with your other hand so the spatula can affectively remove the sticker. Never use a razor blade, it will only lead to you turning to your friend and saying, "Why didn't you tell me not to use a razor?"    Once the sticker has been removed, take your rag and pour a slight amount of rubbing alcohol onto it. Make sure that the rag you use does not have any lint on it, because the lint will stick to the gum from the sticker. You may need to repeat this process several times to remove the gum completely from your car. Rub your finger over the area, and if it feels soft, than this step is completed.|`|ATrakH9uaa	goo off is really good for that|`|Qswzc6w7aa	I dont put those dang things on my car.

Just make sure that the manufacturer offers a lifetime guarantee as most of them do so that if one breaks you can take it back and exchange it for a new one. Craftsman started this but now most of them offer this.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	best quality SNAP-ON . Best quality for money Craftsman|`|AA12095978	Mac or Snap-on is the best I think..    but you can't rule out Craftsman, Husky, or even Great Neck or Stanley.    think about it like this.. you have all snap-on tools.  Nice!  It's a thanksgiving weekend, 4 days off.  you're wrenching a car, your ratchet breaks, or a key tool you NEED breaks.. you call the tool truck guy to come & swap it for you.  WAIT!   He's off for his 4 days, and forget you!  IF you had Craftsman, Husky, etc.. it's a quick trip to sears or home depot, autozone for greatneck, etc.. and BAM.. you're swapped.  downtime: 30 minutes.  Waiting for snap-on truck.. Monday morning.. AND if his route for that day isn't near you.. you get to go meet him.  If you bought every freaking thing in the world from him, expect to see him the next day if you're lucky.  For the price.. snap-on and mac are not bang for your buck tools.  they're great for bragging.  And also I believe the quality of the tool dictates the quality of the job being done.    I have bits & pieces of mac & snap-on stuff, I'm not wrenching anymore, if I break one of thes,e I have to find a tool truck, I have no phone numbers or schedules.  I can mail the tool back to Kenosha, WI and snap on will replace it.. but I have to pay freight.    so my mac & snap on stuff literally is rusting away. It's rarely touched for my fear of having it break.    my craftsman stuff.. I can now goto KMart and they'll swap a broken tool for me now.  Much closer than Sears, by 10 minutes.   My husky stuff.. honestly just as strong if not more stronger than snap on/mac. Matco is good too, but tool truck time..    I've been using Great Neck / Duralast from autozone.  they have lifetime warranties, and the autozone is minutes from my place. they never argue with me if I abuse a screwdriver or use a socket in my impact gun.  they swap it out and I'm on my way.    Sears for a while was repairing the pawl's on their ratchets.  they stopped that.  snap on, mac, matco, will repair whatever they can before giving you a NEW whatever. Saves the rep money.|`|a8m3HdDHaa	MAC
YnXggliYaa	the idle problem can be fixed by turning up ur idle and the rest idk good luck|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	sounds like an emission control device to me
rj470HDZaa	Some cars gain power when the catalytic converter is removed, others loose it. More than likely, the check engine light will be turned on. Built in the early 1990's, it is unlikely that your ECU can be reprogrammed.    However, an experienced Infiniti aficionado may have some advice for you, start with: http://www.nicoclub.com/    Most importantly, in the United States, Federal law prohibits    any person from removing or rendering  inoperative any emission control device  or element of design installed on or in  a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine  prior to its sale and delivery to an  ultimate purchaser and prohibits any  person from knowingly removing or  rendering inoperative any such device  or element of design after such sale and  delivery to the ultimate purchaser.    including the private owner.     Finding a professional to remove the converter and replace it with exhaust pipe will be difficult. Fines can be $10,000 to the person doing the work in addition to $10,000 to the shop's owner.     It is illegal to sell a vehicle that had a factory-installed catalytic converter without one. There goes your resale value.|`|Bl9zcqxQaa	It is a Federal law  to  tamper or remove emission control parts on your vehicle- leave the converter on the car.    You could look into buying a performance converter, which is legal, yet gives you more flow then stock converters.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	your light will come on if you disturb the 02 sensor. by taking the cat off you won,t notice that much more horsepower besides you won,t get it inspected that way and it will be hard on gas.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Your car will drive worse with out the cat, and yes the MIL will come on if your vehicle has a post cat O2 sensor..    Plus if your in NY or California or any other state with federal or state emissions checks as part of your yearly inspection you will never pass.|`|KChL10Yqaa	you won't gain enough horse Power to be impressive for the time it will take to remove them and if your ride is OBD-II compliant then yes your check engine light will come on and if your in a state that's requires inspections the garage will not inspect your vehicle do smog regulations......SORRY|`|YnXggliYaa	U will gain hp but u will also loose torque because less back pressure, if u live in CA don't do it. It depends on the car if the check engine light comes on, my old volvo didnt have a cat and the light never went off but my friend had a jeep and his did
whOm6msoaa	Ten-four good buddy here's a link that should answer most of your questions and then some,good CBing.73's & cheers|`|VXcp8hvHaa	go to craigslist.com and buy one off there, it will be from an individual and they can tell you all about it. I'm a ham radio operator, you might try that.|`|AA12095978	with CB radio you do not need a license.  You should memorize the 10- codes so you won't feel left out.    the best radio's are Cobra's, followed by Midland (IMHO) then Uniden.    Cobra's are a bit pricier, but they offer a lot of features.  you want to buy a radio that has switchable noise filters, RF and MIC gains, and a built in SWR meter.  Having a single side band wouldn't hurt if you actually travel a whole lot.  SSB is more costly, but you get upper and lower channels (80 total) and your range can be a lot further.    Best antenna is and always will be: 102" whip  But for most people, a firestick works very well.  You can get a magnet mount or a hard mount, either will work just fine.  how long? as long as you want it to be.. but, at least 4' high.  if it's going on a pickup truck and you have roll bars, then a 2-3' will be fine.. you don't want it to look obnoxious.
DQkDQraOaa	Road test - 3 times.
Bl9zcqxQaa	You need to take the door panel off to find out for sure, but from my experience, as we do a lot of window and door repairs, sounds like the window regulator cable broke and the motor is trying to raise or lower the window, but because the cable is broke.   You can buy a motor/regulator assembly from the parts stores at a lower cost then a factory part, but wouldnt suggest that if you plan on keeping the vehicle.  They dont last as long as the factory parts. We used them for a while but because of so many failures, we went back to buying the more expensive replacement parts.     Most of the time, when you buy the regulator from the dealer, its going to come as an assembly and you will get the motor also, even though the motor is ok on your door now.   Be prepared, they arent cheap, they can run in the range of 2-300 dollars .  Good luck|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	The only way to tell what is wrong is by taking the inside door panel off and look inside the door.|`|UKNmZsU5aa	yeah,  the windows probably off the track.  For now, I would put a plastic bag over it.|`|YnXggliYaa	My guess is that it is off track or the motor isnt connected to the window|`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	As stated motor in the window is not functioning properly and it seems if you need to use the window often it's best to contact someone ie mechanic or go to a junkyard to find a decent replacement that isn't so expensive.  Give it a go and hope things work out budget wise.    d

PRx6j6YQaa	the company's insurance will pay off both cars that you hit|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	It depends on which state you are in.  In CA, driving a company vehicle, your company's insurance is going to be on the hook for the damage to the car you hit, AND the car they hit.      The surcharge, will follow your PERSONAL insurance - so you WILL see a rate increase.  And it's highly likely, your company's insurance company will require your employer to EXCLUDE you from coverage.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Yes, of course.|`|5ph5hlDwaa	well your company's insurance should pay for it. the person you hit and it was your fault and took off must have been an illegal immigrant. but your company should be paying for it.

I hate seeing spoiled kids driving $75,000 Cadillac SUVs paid for by Daddy.|`|AA11264416	don't listen to alex, the Q7 looks ugly as hell in my opinion, but as long as its full size truck or SUV with a V8 its fine with me lol, i can't stand cars either but only cars i'd even think about getting would be a camaro but has to be a V8 or a corvette, but if you want the caddy then go for it, but stick with GM or at least a ford or dodge|`|7b2RJq47aa	I'd rather a Q7 than an american piece of junk any day|`|OqNTqEdtaa	escallade is cool do not go with ford ive had a expedition and so many problems. but if u cant decide many look into crossovers they aare pretty cool too|`|H8XpaaPDaa	i agree with chris...|`|jERevyR8aa	how about a Range Rover Sport? .. if you decide to go foreign    the escalade is very nice looking, but how about a yukon denali. i think one of those would be much cooler for a younger guy.

pEIbF9DLaa	I Am Hollywood, I suggest you find a local car insurance agent to assist you. Since I live in Oregon I can't suggest an agent in Ohio, but here is an online resource that can help you. http://www.simpleautoquotes.com/Auto-Ins...   Good Luck.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	That's a loaded question.  Anyone who says, "the insurance follows the car" or "the insurance follows the driver", well, there are ALWAYS exceptions.    One exception is, household members, or people with regular access to the car.  Your mom would have to list you as an operator on her policy, in order for you to be covered - as her son, you'd have regular access to her car.|`|hvjWpq2naa	No, you are driving uninsured.|`|lgoz4bxfaa	Yes, you can if you were to get in an accident you will get 3RD PARTY COVERAGE that means that the insurance company will cover half of the cost. To get full coverage the owner would have to register you under his/her name.|`|tDKuTKG5aa	It depends, you would have to look at their policy to know for sure.    Some policies you would be covered, but others you wouldn't.  You just don't want to learn the hard way and drive their vehicle and not be covered.    Check out their policy!|`|tLO16Kvoaa	Perhaps You could google it first ,nonetheles, if you perfer some direct resource ,here http://www.Autoinsurancepro.info/auto-in...  might be your choice.

lLZqNNUdaa	That is covered in your Drivers Manual. You did read it, didn't you?    A  provisional license means that there are restrictions on your driving such as how many teen passengers you can have in the car, what hours of the day you can drive, etc.  Check your Drivers Manual to see what specific restrictions apply in your jurisdiction.

Vfyi81C5aa	I've always purchased an extended auto warranty for every vehicle I've owned in the last 10 years. In the beginning I used to get them from the dealer, but lately it's less expensive to get them from an aftermarket company that specializes in warranties. http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Wa... They offer free quotes, so it can't hurt to see how much one would cost for your car.
wpgRMjgraa	Yes if its equipped with an a/c and you have it running but no if it is some other type of fluid......
0wZcKn8Zaa	to find the starter on any car follow your positive (red) battery cable. It will go to a solenoid then your starter|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s right by the transmission bell housing.|`|iCgfXY7Naa	While I agree with Adam, if you have the Northstar engine, finding the starter by following wires is not going to be easy. That's because these engines have the starter located under the intake manifold in the middle of the engine. You are going to have to remove the intake to access it.

HpwyYmoIaa	the only way to keep insurance down is to not get any tickets and try and avoid wrecks, insurance will be high but it gets lower after you turn 21 most of the time, a toyota carolla or camry are very good reliable and gas efficient cars and i would recommend one of those, i wouldnt recommend a honda they are decent and i would only get one if its a last resort, i dont live anywhere near vegas but you could probably call the local dmv and they will probably be able to answer your other questions

M7G3MZb5aa	LED healamp fixtures are actually slowly working their ways into cars,  IN performance they fall between incandescent bulbs, and HID lamp, in terms of how much light they produce.    One problem with led bulbs is the tremendous amoutn fo heat they create, it is difficult to manufacture headlamp assemblies that can disperse the heat each individual LED creates because they are all so close to eachother.    Some of the new audis have led headlights|`|kIy2bdiraa	No, get HID if you want bright lights ( also don't break as easy due to vibration)|`|zj91sSsuaa	I don't think you can use them like that because the light is scattered all over from each LED.  You know how you can't see the stars because of light pollution, well the same thing will happen with each LED, sure you'll see them, but not as good as it could be.  If they made a bigger one and focused the light within the LED it would work.
cQqc1Qicaa	Avoid the Supra as it is old enough to be a challenge to maintain and is more likely to have had a hard life.  Ditto the Integra.  I would consider the CRX if it's in really good shape, but the Nissan should be your first choice.  The drivetrain and chassis are well-balanced and if something goes wrong, it is more serviceable than the others.|`|PRx6j6YQaa	whatever car you buy have it checked out by a mechanic well worth the money

Homeland Security requires that driver licence photos are taken with the same rules as applicable to passport photos.  The same rule has been adopted in Canada.

In that price there'd be a few with relatively low miles and so you'll get quite a few more out of it. Anything less and I suggest a Lexus SC400/Toyota Soarer GT Limited.

Here an instruction permit/learners permit is the equivalent of your G1, and most states allow you to get that somewhere between 15-16 years old.

cQqc1Qicaa	All employers want technicians with decent driving records.  You have to be able to test drive customer's cars to verify problems and repairs.  You may also have to drive a company vehicle.  Your employer's business insurer will likely be more picky than your auto insurer.  Even if you don't have enough points against your record to loose your license, they may consider you too risky if you have a poor record.  If the business insurer won't cover you, you're not a good hire.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Technically and legally you don't even have to know how to drive to be a mechanic.

zYqojwLFaa	its simply worn out...  its more noticable in the higher gears at low speed as the engine is revving but the car aint moving...    you need a new clutch...    its hard to notice that the clutch is wearing out as you get used to driving it every day and it wears out slowly, but because you can tell that its slippig in 5th gear, then you know its time for a new one...|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Before you replace the clutch, you need to check whether the linkage is adjustable.  If it is, you can loosen the clutch linkage and it'll be fine.    If you can't do that, then it's worn out. The friction surface wore away.  Slipping in 5th is the sign.

U24VtSlZaa	there is no kind of drivers license that converts from one jurisdiction to a different jurisdiction.    And there is no such thing as a US drivers license (except for the military license).    You have to apply for a license to the state in which you reside.    if you are visiting in the states, your International Driving Permit along with your license from your country of residence will be valid.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Most states will simply exchange licenses from Canada for their own.  A few states also have agreements with other countries, most commonly Germany for some reason.  But in most cases, you will have to take the tests.|`|AA11914369	None of the states recognize a foreign license without being tested.  And there is no "international license", there is an international permit, but that is merely a translation of your valid license into several languages to be carried with, not instead of, your valid license.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	None.  You can't automatically transfer - you have to take the tests.|`|lLZqNNUdaa	The so called International Drivers License is NOT valid in the United States, and in some states, like California it is specifically prohibited from use by law.     If you are visiting you can use the current, valid license from your home country for up to 6 months, and if you have immigrated here you must apply for a drivers license in the state you are residing in.

AA12095978	sounds like you just had a bad set of 70/75 watt bulbs.  It happens.    warning about putting to high a wattage bulb in.. the wires that power the H4 bulbs are designed to allow 60watts to burn.  if you put in 100watts, that's more power to push through the thin wires.  you could potentially burn the wires up and you get to fix that.

8ZmPfacsaa	the CVX has a higher sensativy rating, which means it is louder.. a 12" alpine type-x has a sens. of 83db while a 12" kicker cvx is just over 87 db.. an increase of 3db is equivalent to double the sound so every 3 db increase the sound is double.. so since the cvx has little over 3db more then the type-x.. its a little over half as loud|`|9YT51l8Iaa	Sensitivity does not work that way. for one, you need to know if the sub was measured at break in or after break in.

0Z9jssmfaa	What they said, and a couple other things will help. A big Power capacitor (like a Tsunami 20 Farrad for example) will help take up some slack and reduce the sudden demand on the alternator. ANd upgrade the power and ground wires in your car if you haven't already. Go for 4 gauge wire for both and run them from your battery all the way back to the amp directly. Also upgrade the power wire from the alternator to the battery (4 gauge as well). The factory wire is only a wee little thing and doesn't do well pushing all the extra power out to the battery.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	dual batteries, an ambulance alternator|`|7f1d9gDAaa	First thing i would upgrade is the battery.

qsozRiDGaa	For summer tires, a 235/60/15 would be the max. For winter/off road tires, 235/75/15. You might be able to fit 30/9.5/15 tires but they may rub slightly.  What you are looking for is a tire with a height of no more than 29.5 inches. Best of luck.
D7I6vwHWaa	Its actually called an (IAC) idle air control, sounds like you may have a vacuum leak (?) Try spraying carb cleaner on all vac lines and fittings also on intake manifold where it connects to the engine. If the rpm changes while spraying these areas, this will tell you where it is. Also try unpluging (IAC) connector and see if makes a difference, if not, reconnect IAC and unplug maf sensor and see if it will run. Doing this will set your check engine light, but you can clear it by disconnecting the Neg battery cable for 5 mins. Check the intake and clean around the throttle butterfly, open butterfly and remove any dirt and gunk build-up. Hope it works!|`|zYqojwLFaa	i had a celica which had the same problem is the MAF sensor was dirty.. this was a common problem in the 7th gen celicas    all i had to so was clean the sensor and it was fine (until it got dirty again...) i didnt need to replace it..    so clean it youself and see what happens... go to your local car parts shop and see if they have CRC MAF cleaner... i used electrical cleaner which doesnt leave a residue...

e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Yes, but the permission, is a notarized legal document, called a "power of attorney" form.  She'll have to have a lawyer draw it up.      It's probably easier - and cheaper - for her to just sign the title and mail it to you.    Keep in mind, if your friend doesn't hand you the title, signed over to you, then he doesn't have the right to sell the car.  Cars are sold via TITLE, not bill of sale.|`|AA11914369	No, he can not sign for her.

af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Get another estimate--your insurance company usually wants two, anyway.  I don't think your company can deny your claim by whose fault it is, but they can and will raise your premiums.   You will have to pay whatever the "deductible" is for your policy, and your insurance will cover the rest. If the other driver is determined to be at fault, your ins will go after theirs,|`|AA12095978	Usually a body shop will blow the price way up because they're assuming insurance will pay for it, and insurance companies don't really question the billing policies of body shops.  If you tell the person you are paying for it yourself, no insurance involved, the price will go way down.     No matter what, your own insurance will pay if they have to, your rates might go up, but they should take care of things.  the other insurance company is dragging their feet because they probably don't want to pay out and are hoping you'll go away.    the body guy is right, he could put some pressure on the insurance companies, but it's YOU that could suffer.    if the other person's insurance refuses to pay you tell YOUR insurance this and then make them sue on your behalf.    as for the radiator.. there is SOME truth to what he said, however if your radiator isn't leaking now, I doubt it will leak at all.  You're lucky the airbag didn't go off.. that'd be more money.    what body shops do is buy the parts needed from a dealership, and they don't exactly get good pricing, but the part is guarenteed to fit and that's why they go there, and they charge MSRP on the part to whomever.    If you were doing this on your own dime,you could order a new headlamp assembly for probably $100 and the fender you could find at a junkyard maybe, or craigslist or even ebay. some auto parts stores can order body panels.  you then go somwhere to have it painted.  and you're on your way to repairing it yourself.
G5cBAB2Caa	no it will not run the battery down unless you sit it there for 5 years. the reason the clock is on even when you turn the truck off is because the radio gets a constant trickle of power so that all your presets remain and the closk keeps the time. its still getting the power even when you turn it "off" the display just isnt on to show it|`|L0H4iVHWaa	lol    no.. your clock will not run out..    the only way it would is if the radio/clock stayed on while the car is OFF.. because your battery is used ONLY to start your car.. after that is when the power comes from the alternator.. the battery is used only to start a car and to run the vehicles accessories when the vehicle is OFF only.|`|CFA4KG2Uaa	hopefully not i dont think a clock can ruin your battery but again if your gonna leave your car unattended for a long then just disconnect it from the battery|`|YLncjJ8Caa	yes it will but it would take a year if ur truck was just sitting but the alternator charges ur battery so no it wont run ur battery down..
DydFQ0fcaa	The check engine light error you're referring to, "secondary air injection system-incorrect flow detected", means there is a leak somewhere on the air pump assembly (part of the emissions-regulating equipment).     What you need to do is inspect for damaged vacuum hoses at the secondary air inlet valve (2) to Combi valve (20) and vacuum hose (20) from the secondary air inlet valve (2) to the brake booster vacuum check valve. *refer to this picture http://z.about.com/d/autorepair/1/0/7/E/... *    The vacuum hoses are covered in a braided cloth and are easily cracked or broken due to temperature variations on Saab's and VW's (very common problem). Replace the hose(s) that are damaged. The hoses are easy to remove, just pull on it close to whatever it's connected to and it'll come right off. There's no clamps or anything holding them on.
kIy2bdiraa	How high does it rev?  You might need to get the clutch rebuilt.    I know that sometimes people change the weights so that the sled will launch harder.
VTtka1ubaa	Your Saab has two systems for ice - traction control and what is called Stabilization control (or in GM terms since parts come from the other GM divisions - Stablitrack).  For the front wheels, traction control, it retards engine power to the wheels in the front of the car if you fail to get traction on the ice or snow.  For Stabilitrack for the rear wheels, it works by engaging the brakes on each wheel independently where the computer senses that the wheel is slipping.  The front wheel are powered while the rear wheels are not, so the approaches are different.  So when you see the triangle with the car in it, you also probably see wavey lines under the car (which represents skidding).  It amounts to the display saying the system is in use.    Note that the more often you engage Stabilitrack, the more often the brakes are engaged.  The more often you use it, the more rapidly the rear break pads will wear out.  I just had my 30,000 mile service on my 2006 Saab 9-3, and it was just over $200 to replace the rear brake pads.  Had to do it since I have had a lot of snow in NJ/PA these last three years since I bought the car (and have used the system a lot).  The good thing about it is the Saab is very stable in ice and snow for a front wheel drive car.  The bad thing is that the brakes can get expensive.  Still, I prefer safety over the added cost.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	sounds like your traction control or anti lock brakes are engaging - read your owner's manual for more explanation.
U24VtSlZaa	Race and sexual orientation are irrelevant.    Hard to tell from your question...there are 6 women and one man, and one of the women is driving, and the driver is the only survivor?  Are you asking will the driver get paid for each life lost?    Life insurance proceeds are paid to the named beneficiary, and no one else.  If the driver is named as the beneficiary on all six life insurance policies, then yes, she gets the money.    If you're talking about auto insurance proceeds, the owner of the car gets paid for damage to the car.    If you're talking about a wrongful death lawsuit, generally only close relatives have any standing to sue for wrongful death.|`|fQBfjdz1aa	First off your  questions makes no since.  It makes not difference to an insurance company what your race, citizenship or sexual orientation is.      the rest of your questions makes no sense.  The only ones to collect anything would be the survivors of the deceased passengers.      And who is the SHE that would be paid for each person?    you need to clarify this if you're really wanting a serious answer|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	First off race and sexual orientation have no bearing whatsoever. Unless the driver had a life insurance policy on each person in the vehicle where the driver was the beneficiary she would not receive anything from life insurance. As for the auto insurance, having an improper number of passengers in the vehicle has no bearing on the death benefits payout. What she would receive would depend on what state or province the policy was purchased in. So without knowing this it is impossible to say what, if anything, she would receive. I can say for sure that she would not receive anything for the death of anyone who wasn't a spouse or child.

ZHhi8vSjaa	the remote wire on your amp is running off your antenna power because when you switch to cd it shuts off antenna power you just have to find another source for power that turns off with the key but stays on when the key is on hope this helps|`|4a0Akgieaa	The amp must be wired to the electric antenna output from your head unit. So it shuts off when playing CD's. Your head unit may have it's own accessory wire also, for amps, if not you have to wire it into another power source.|`|AA10906914	The cure:    Run a fused (1 amp, 14 AWG) wire from a fuse in the fuse panel that only has power when the car is ON to one side of a switch. From the other side of the switch run the same sized wire to the REM (remote) connection on the amp.     This allows for full control and you never have to worry about forgetting to turn off the amp. The switch is so you can turn off the amp at will so as not to give grandma a heart attack in the car.    You can find fuse taps and in-line fuse holders at any autoparts store.
dRozk0cCaa	yeah you could get any aftermarket radio but make sure you get the right harness, dash kit, and antenna adapter. for your car you'll need the harness which will be metra 70-7551, antenna adapter metra 40ni10, and dash kit metra 99-7417

nyrXBf6kaa	Well, I would think that if you are going to shop for a new car (because you're parents don't want you driving a used car), then they should definitely go to the dealership with you, to make sure they don't try to take advantage of your lack of experience. Trust me, with the economy the way it is now, they will try ANYTHING to sell you a car. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!    I would first suggest going to www.kbb.com, which is the web site for Kelly Blue Book, which can give you an estimate of what you should be spending on a car. There is also a section for 'New Cars' by going here: http://www.kbb.com/kbb/NewCars/BlueBookV...     I would highly suggest not getting an auto loan... they can be really messy, & if you ever need finical help down the road they'll try to get you to "refinance" your auto loan, which just makes a bigger mess (in my opinion). My mother always taught me that if you can't afford it, then look somewhere else, or don't get it at all. Credit cards & loans are the two main reasons why people struggle with money (because it's just TOO easy to say "I'll pay for it later!").    Something I would also look into if I were you (so you can bring this up to your parents), there are some dealerships that sell cars they call "pre-owned certified". Where they are previously owned cars, they have to go through testing & such to become certified, so the only thing that you could consider 'wrong' with the car would be that the mileage isn't at 0. Also those cars usually have warranties, but majority of the time the warranty is only for 30-90 days. I would try to look into getting the highest warranty (90 days for a minimum), because you want to be able to drive the car long enough to detect if there are any problems, because if you find a problem & it's still under the warranty they have to fix it for free.     Also when shopping for your new car I would suggest looking into how many miles it gets per gallon. Gas prices keep going up & down, so it's best to not spend too much money filling up your tank (if you can help it). Anything in the high 20's or anything in the 30's is a great start!    I hope I was able to help you, sorry for the many paragraphs! =) Good luck, & have fun!|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Just a quick correction, the Corolla is actually Japanese ;)    And the Corolla would be the best on a budget as well. Cheap to run, cheap to repair, cheap everywhere basically.    The terms S, CE, LE etc. would refer to trim levels. If you see an increase in price over the different symbols then thats obviously the higher trim level. Look at the auto makers website (ie. Toyota for the Corolla) or Wikipedia to work out which trim levels are which. I'm not entirely sure myself to be honest, but do a little bit of research and I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.    Hope this helped.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	You need to understand HOW the dealers make their money & that everything is negotiable.    The make money in four (4) key ways:  1 -Price of car (you go to the blue book and find the price range and negotiate)  2 - Low ball pricing your trade-in, they market later and do well on it (know it's value)  3 - Interest rate . . . the lenders give back money to the dealer for sales at high rates, have a pre-approval from a CU or bank to force them to match/beat it.  4 - Add-ons to deal (extended warrenty, features on car you may not need/want    They MUST make a profit and you must allow them to win in some areas but remember . . . if you buy their car, they win. If you pay too much, you lose.    Research (internet) the price/features on the car you want, interest rates, have a bank/credit union in your pocket before you visit a dealer, know the value of your trade-in. Do not accept or be willing to pay for featurees that you do not want to pay for.    ABOVE ALL . . . shop dealers for the car you want and don't be an ' Oh, I gotta have it' buyer, let them have to SELL you (they need the biz, make them work for it by giving you a deal and breaks). ALWAYS maintain walk-away power. and BE willing to walk.    I just bought my wife a nice Cadillac DTS for $13400 that is two years old with 38000 miles - check the book on a fully loaded ride like this. It took five hours to make the deal and the manager followed me out to my car as I walked away in order to give me the deal I wanted. They made money, I got a good deal - everyone won, it was a good negotiation.    Buying USED cars is where the value is found . . . buying new cars is simply not wise - dealers do not have a lot of wiggle room on new cars - they can not come down very well.

379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Real simple. You go there, pick out an overpriced junk car and make the payments to them. When you miss a payment, they repo the car and re-sell it to another sucker.|`|ewbuVeTTaa	If financing a car isn't an option, a Buy Here/Pay Here lot isn't going to be a good idea. The cars there are often marginal to bad quality as stated for one. Two, the finance charges and interest will be near, at or above what your state law allows for usury. Three, say something happens and miss a payment, they will repossess it and resell it to someone else and the cycle repeats.    If you can afford the down payment for one of their cars, $500-$2500 usually at a buy here/pay here lot, you can afford to go on Craigslist, eBay, the local newspaper classifieds or Auto Trader and buy a car outright with cash. That way, it's yours free and clear and you don't make payments to anyone.  The price for buy here/pay here lots are $50 a week and above, which means $200+ a month, since there are four weeks in a month.     If I were you, I'd take your down payment money and put it toward a car you can buy outright from Craigslist, eBay, the classifieds or Auto Trader.  The payments you would make to a buy here/pay here lot could be put elsewhere.    $2500 will buy a decent shape 1990s era Toyota Corolla or Honda Accord and a few others. They won't be perfect, but will be better than the buy here/pay here lots.

TdrgZwnoaa	The Cavalier/Sunfire series from GM are the oldest technology on the road today. They stop poorly, have crappy fuel mileage and handle like a stick in a bucket of "mud".     That said; they are very reliable cars. I have a 1998 model that I want to replace with a better car. Problem is, I can't kill this thing. It is like the Michael Myers of the automotive world. Parts are cheap and most repairs are simple. I have not had a major complaint with this car until this week when the starter gave up the fight at 140,000 miles. I bought a used one for $20.00 at a scrap yard and I can replace it myself.   If you drive this car in a responsible manner you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for a sports car look elsewhere.|`|HtCKBRv1aa	I would recommend the 2002 or later models, they have the ECOTEC engine which has much more power and better fuel economy, it's better than even the best Japanese 4 cylinder engines.|`|AA11458886	It's OK, Depends on the mileage...but its not a bad first car...|`|yCqp0BCLaa	first car worthy but I wouldn't call them nice,dependable though|`|uLLHFiT3aa	You get what you pay for. They're cheap to buy repair and insure but they're not as reliable as a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla. Regardless of make or model take any used car to a mechanic for a pre purchase inspection. And get a insurance quote for the vehicle before buying. You can't believe the cost of insurance on some cars (especially for young drivers).|`|84FT1Kznaa	my wife and i have been married for 12 years.. when we got married she was driving an old cavalier''89 model'' she recently wanted to trade it in on somthing newer..i said to get what ever you whant with in reason! so she came back with another cavalier! its a 2003 model''that she got,but she also kept the old one..she said''the car has been to good over the years just to get rid of'' so i drive the old cavalier back and forth to work each day.and it has 223thousand miles on it and still runs like a champ.. so i would tell anyone to get a cavalier if they wanted a great little  car that is also good on gas!

The oil in the engine lubricates the moving parts inside the engine, no oil no lubricating. The parts get red hot and start to melt together. The first thing  to go will be the pistons which are made of aluminum and the rings. Then the engine will start knocking and eventually seize up.If the engine oil light did not come on or still had oil pressure and you only added like 3 quarts of oil it will probably be ok. But if there are knocks,clicking, smoking form the tail pipe, or blow by form the oil filler cap,engine miss firring then you probably need and engine replaced. hope this helps you good luck|`|V1bsgGP0aa	If you run it long enough you will ruin your engine.

I googled a similar used car search tool in australia, you can put your post code and try to find stuff near where you are.    http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/usedcars/m...    By the way, I have a similar story of experience to tell... I had to move and figured it would be cheaper to buy a pick-up truck than to rent a u-haul.  I found one for $450, and it was a classic 1959 Ford F-100 with a 292 V8.  I went to register it and there was back registration due, $200 to get it registered.  I noticed a wheel wobbling a bit and some lug nuts were loose and apparently stripped.  In the shop about another $200-300 to replace some hubs and bearings that were in unsafe to drive shape.  Oh and it was 1959 so I thought it didn't need to pass emissions, but I was wrong, I had to pass emissions test, and it was not firing on all cylinders and required extremely messed up carb setting, 2 barrel carb and they basically shut off fuel to the right engine bank to make it pass emission running on only 4 cylinders... but it was not drivable in this condition, so I had to un-do the fix I paid the mechanic $200 to make before I could drive it home.  So that cheap truck that saved me money, i spent more for the mechanic than I spent for the truck itself.  I have repeated similar experience several times buying cheap cars for kids and then when an old engine or transmission goes out it still costs thousandish to do something about, and a cheap thing no longer seems cheap.  Just rent the $700 van and you have less risk of unknown outcome.|`|iCKkOWI7aa	no|`|e782afed89cc03df5992da9a17af2969aa	get your neighbour to do it

I used epoxy to get that sucker back on.  Clips would be common sense and the obvious choice, but sometimes the entire area that can be clipped has snapped off for people with our luck.  If it is not too cold (ideally, if you can garage it), you could use some epoxy putty in liberal doses to hold it on there, use clamps to keep it in place since shutting the door would possibly jar it and loosen the connection.  You can then tape your door light switch to save the battery, and let her dry.  Note that it will be ON there for good, and removing it could possibly mean a lot of cracked plastic.  Only an issue if you ever want to replace any speakers or lights.|`|AA12051696	DUCT TAPE!!!!!! haha. usually door panels have those reall annoying barbed plastic clips that hold them on to the door. you can get them dirt cheap at any automotive or even hardware store.

It does not seem to make sense, to do the swap, you can get as much hp out of a 350 chev, as long as you want to make the truck streetable|`|yzZchHHTaa	Sure, I've seen some with them in it.  Chevy actually produced some around that year, but you will need the computer and wiring harness also, depending on what year the motor is.  There may be a few more mods needed for the suspension, gearing in rear end, bigger radiator, exhaust,and motor mounts, but can be done. Not sure if I would go with an automatic or 5 or 6 speed transmission.

After you get the code you can go to sites like <a href="http://www.autoreairs.about.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoreairs.about.com/</a>  or <a href="http://www.obd2-codes.com/trouble_codes?" rel="nofollow">http://www.obd2-codes.com/trouble_codes?</a>   pretty much anything with the obd2 in it. I hope this helps, Good Luck. :^)|`|AA10873763	Try getting it scanned somewhere else.  I have a similar situation with my Lumina where one shop gets nothing and another gets a laundry list of codes.|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	when it's scanned and the computer does not read then normally it could be the computer has failed, or the ground to the computer however it should go to limp in mode and not drive to bad, my guess is the map sensor or mass air flow sensor is defective. Also the battery connection to the computer could be bad.

Specifications and approvals are everything. There are two established testing bodies. The API (American Petroleum Institute), and the European counterpart, the ACEA (Association des Constructeurs Europeens d'Automobiles - which was the CCMC). You've probably never heard of either of them, but their stamp of approval will be seen on the side of every reputable can of engine oil.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	usually 5w-30|`|RiQA4Epraa	5w30
r1D9P4Vyaa	Miss`n mom is right when it comes to warranty repairs, they pay squat for the Techs. I would bring it to a different dealer, (other then Toyota) for the oil change and just tell them I see oil spots on my new garage floor, can you see what may be leaking? (even though it may not leak) And also can you check it over for me when you are doing the oil change for any thing else I need. Do Not tell them this is for warranty reasons. You will sound more like it is for customer pay repairs, (good pay for the Tech) and get a real good check over, and then get the estimate in writing, then say ok, let me run this by my wife or think about it. Then you will have a good inspection done for the price of the oil change and know more about your car. Good Luck. :^)<br>  <br>  You did not hear this from me. lol|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	Yes you can go and get it checked and you can ask to extend the warranty for two years for a low price so do it and don't worry they are supposed to have major maintenance checkups at 60,000 miles. and Most car companies want happy customers not unhappy cause they will not get return business and they now know quality makes more car sales.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	most dealerships won't go looking for problems with warranty work because it is so hard to get paid on from the companies. Just make a list of things that you would like checked when taking the car in. ... any rattles, loose parts, noises.. etc.|`|AAu7NjSDaa	I've always purchased an auto warranty for every car I've owned in the last 8 years.

gwVnvKXRaa	Depends on the style you purchased, if they are not "In Channel" yes on the paint, but on my trucks i personally buy the ones that go in channel and have the 3m tape on them also so they hold good and tight in the channels!
AA11101806	the plugs aren't set properly (possibly bad plug wires).  the putt putting is likely from a cylinder that isn't firing or getting enough power.|`|AA12095978	the spark plug gap should be .054"<br>  also double platnum plugs MUST be used because of the waste spark system, Motorcraft plugs are best for that truck.  The 4.0L Ford motors do not like copper plugs.<br>  the putt putting could be from a spark plug wire that isn't on tight, number 5 plug, passenger side, back of engine is very hard and tight to get to, and pushing plug wire onto that plug is a hassle.<br>  <br>  Also the wires could be out of order at the coil pack.<br>  <br>  your coil pack:<br>  <br>    3  4<br>    2  6<br>    1  5<br>  <br>  engine:<br>  <br>   3   6<br>   2   5<br>   1   4<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	In other words, check the firing order of the spark plug wires. It's not real hard to do. You should be able to find some info at autozone.com about the firing order.
