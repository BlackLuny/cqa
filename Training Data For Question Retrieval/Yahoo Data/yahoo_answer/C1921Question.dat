Alright, Im trying to connect to xbox live with my modem (i just got an xbox) and I hooked it up to my router.  Now, I can get it to the Network adapter but it fails every time for the IP.  The Dhcp is enabled, I have ICS, and I've done all the IP changes for both the 360 and computer.  Someone suggested that it might be a firewall or something, its not a firewall, they also said to changed to a shared WEP key.  Well I don't think I have a WEP key, even if I did, how do I change it to shared. but thats not the main question.        How do I get it so IP doesn't fial the TEST!?       I've also restarted my modem, computer and console several times.

The screen its stuck on is the one with the two arrow circle saying "Connected / Eject before disconnecting"   I would normally tinker with the controls but it froze with the hold button on as well so the turn wheel does not work.      I plan on having it examined by someone at the apple store but in the mean time does anyone know anything to remedy the problem?      P.S. It also says that the USB unit has malfunctioned and Windows no longer recognizes it. (if that helps)

20090202164226AAO7Z0x	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Wii Virgin - what's it all about?	Right - i quite fancy this idea of "get fit in your living room"....alot of people i know, swear by the Wii Fit. So i have NO idea what the Wii is really, okay its basically a games console?? Yes?? If so, it plugs into your tv, yeah?? And if yes (lol) then do you have to have a particular type of tv? And do u have to have like digital boxes, capabilities etc etc?? Cos i have an Old-ish sony - no hd ready malarkey or anything...no digital box etc (yes, i know i need to get with the times!) So would a Wii console WORK on any tv? If so, where is a good place to buy from? I am sure you must be able to buy the Wii and Wii Fit in a bundle - if so, what is the kind of "going rate"...?? Help, people!! (Gosh i am so embarrassed that i know nothing!!)

Now the manual doesnt hold any info that i need. The way i had my stuff setup was tv and comp separately. The computer had the small normal computer plugs for audio, and i was using splitters to hook up 2 different systems, a surround sound set up and just a basic 2 speaker sub woofer setup. So i know how to hook up my tv and stuff. The only problem is my home theatre system doesnt have any of the small plugs, just the regular red and white speaker connections. So i could hook up my speaker, but how would i hook up my 2 sub woofers and be able to switch the sound between tv and computer or both. Ive got a dennon arv-888. Thanks
20090202174238AAGG9rV	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Does it cost to use java?	i want to know if it's going to cost me to play a game using java on my phone. i just downloaded it today (for free) but when i went to play it, it said something about asking to display advertisements, or connect to them or something, and i 'might' get charged. the first time i played, it asked to connect to the internet and when i said no said it needed to. the second time i played, it went straight to the game and instead of the internet icon being displayed at the top of the screen, it just showed the java icon. but i don't know if using java is a charge? i have a sony ericsson w580i and at&t. i have unlimited text, including multimedia messages, and instant messaging. i just don't know if java's included, or if i'm going to be charged at all?   this is only important because i quit my job recently and i don't want to give my parents a reason to take my phone away, as they're going to be the ones paying for it until i can find another job. heh...

I have an LG CU515 on an ATT wireless plan and I am constantly receiving text messages from a person that I don't want to hear from.  Although the messages are not threatening or harassing they are very annoying.  I know that ATT has something that will block certain numbers but it costs $4.99/mo and this is not worth wasting the money.  Is there any way to block the number for free? I don't want to get a new number or pay extra nor can I stop my text messaging service as I need it in my work.

I've got over 2300 songs now, and I was fooling around organizing files and I moved some of the music files. Now, probably about half of my songs have that little exclamation point by them, when you click to listen to the song it says "The song '....' could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it?" and then ya goes and searches for it. Is there a way I can do a whole bunch at once instead of having to locate over a thousand songs individually? Is there a faster way to fix this problem? Thanks in advance!
20090202175046AAgWICA	Consumer Electronics;TVs	What are these digital channels?	Now, I'm a bit confused here. Recently I got a Toshiba LCD TV.

I didn't know about this before. What exactly are these?

20090202175610AA89Hxe	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	What phone should I get?	Alright I've had the SamSung Instinct from Sprint for one month now. I am happy with the phone and everything but I am not happy about texting. It is hard to text on sometimes it is not very responsive and it's just "laggy" when I text fast I'm a fast texter. I am ready to make an early termination fee because I am a major texter maniac in my life I need to move onto the phone for me.      I like Sprint but I found AT&T and I'm ready to try them.      Alright well the first phone I decided to pick out was the LG Vu. My friend has one and it's just wicked sick. I texted on it a little and it seemed to have no lag but I haven't played with it long enough. And I also tried my friends SamSung Eternity. It was very fast with no lag from applications but I never got to try texting.       I want a phone I can text really fast on with the QWERTY keyboard or the vertical keyboard like a normal phone with numbers. With no lag too. I don't care about the TV\Video I played with that on my Instinct. I just care about the texting part and possibly the web browser and email access.       My main needs are a phone that wont lag when I'm texting fast on it, and if it does lag I want the phone with the most minimum lag to do that,least lag.      What should I do Yahoo!      Should I get the SamSung Eternity? Or should I get the LG Vu?      I am not sure I need your help please help me decide for the best texting device of those two. With a great web browser and email access.         Also to go with that, in a call, how do you end the call in either of the phones? Is it like the SamSung instinct where i swipe end call? And do either of the phones have a "mute" button inside.         Thank you for your time,         - Kyle

20090202192753AApGdrI	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why is my iPod freezing?	I have a third generation iPod nano that I bought in October 2007.  It's had occasional freezing (usually only freezing is when I plug it into my computer, and it's always done it) -- I know that restarting it will work once it freezes but for an iPod thats just over a year old, it shouldn't be freezing like this.  When I put it on pause and leave it on pause for a few minutes, I go back to find it has frozen on me, which is kind of weird and i just started noticing it this past week.  Restarting it does work, but obviously there's something wrong with my iPod. I haven't had this problem with my iPod video, which is almost a year older than my nano, so I am a bit worried.   Has anyone had this problem? Is there another way to fix it besides reformatting it? Will reformatting it actually fix the problem?  Thanks in advance guys~

20090202191830AA3ZHw9	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Ringtones for Nokia 5300?	Kayso, I made a ringtone online and formatted it as AAC. I know that my phone plays files formatted as .mp3 or .aac. There are other ones as well, but from what I've heard, I prefer AAC file. Sooo, I formatted the ringtone to .AAC, and when I dragged it into my phone, it won't let me set it as my ringtone. I've actually had a tone, using it for I believe 6 months now, I'm getting tired of it, and I downloaded it using my phone. It's also formatted as .aac, so therefore I tried it with the ringtone I made, but then again, it won't let me.      Erm, can anyone help, please? D':

I want something wayyyyyy more exciting, so I need to choose between the top three phones I like; Voyager, Dare or env2. If you have these phones, tell me everything about it, good, bad, +/-, anything. I'll tell you what I know so far.
