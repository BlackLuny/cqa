Thatcher shied away from privatising  Royal Mail or Liberalising postal services even when it was running a profit.  So although not in power her legacy of self before service, profit before community, and New Liebours policies of market driven public services and target driven policies that detract from the core services, is what has got us into the present mess.<br>  <br>  Cant wait till I can sing "The wicked witch is dead"|`|9d792c6e2da6e5b53a036baec7115b43aa	I do not think so because Cameron is a Thatcherite and it seems that the Tories will probably win the next election. The effects of her reign are still with us and many of the problems facing us are down to her. She created the "I want and I want now" syndrome and "I will get it at any cost" attitude.<br>  She was hell bent on annihilating the unions. This was more to do with revenge over the three day week which bought down the Heath government than for the benefit of the country. Admittedly the unions were getting too strong but she could have negotiated with them rather than crucifying them.<br>  She sold off the energy industries at giveaway prices and let them run riot with prices. It is no surprise that these have now ended up in foreign hands.<br>  She bought in the right to buy scheme but at the same time abolished the building of any further council houses leaving a vast shortage of accommodation.<br>  She kept unemployment high to ensure that those with a job towed the line for fear of losing their jobs. Workers were prepared to stab fellow workers in the back.<br>  It was not only the Scots who Thatcher was against. Look what she did to South Wales.<br>  In 1982 she was the most unpopular Prime Minister of all time and it was only the Falklands War which saved her. She was also lucky that Labour was in a terrible state with no proper leadership and had made itself practically unelectable. Had they been stronger she would never have lasted as long.<br>  I have heard she will get a State funeral when she dies. Why? Whoever decided this? She was just downright evil.|`|NVwmUEgKaa	Fingers crossed, yes!

But in the case of Jade Goody, while I'm certain that she marries him for the right reasons (i.e. love) but I'm not sure about the guy. I think if Jade's days were not numbered this guy would probably have already disappeared from the scene after a short-lived romance between them. Judging by his past, perhaps they would have had a big bust-up and would have split up. He knows she hasn't got long to live so I think he just agreed to this marriage for two reasons: 1. money, 2. because he knows there's no real commitment to her as in a marriage between healthy people who are not facing the death of one of them.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	I don't know hun.

AA11530601	yeah I love rap music but I agree that a lot of time, I have to work hard to ignore how ignorant the lyrics are. I love beats but dont listen to it as much as I used to for that reason As a female, it can hurt. I heard one song that said a "bi*ch you shouldnt even be speaking, just sucking my d*ck" as u can imagine I never listened to it again. Yes rappers are hypocrites - kind of weakens their case for racism when they are so sexist themselves.   Now i tend to listen to rappers who dont say that kind of stuff, but many do, and not just the MTV stuff. NWA were probably one of the most talented rap groups of all time and I do like them however some of their lyrics are very degrading.

Not all rap is self-indulgent references to girls, guns and drugs.     There is Intelligent rap that questions & speaks about the current situation in our world and portray women in a positive light (Mos Def, Talib Kweli, The Roots, etc) but MTV doesn't appear to want to filter this kind of rap to you... they want you to continue to remain dumb and not ask questions.

FO1XCZc4aa	I donated  but am always dubious about giving money as I have heard loads of stories about how donations never get to the cause. I stopped supporting Oxfam when I learnt hardly any (10p in the pound) went directly to the cause. Another example was Barnardo's and I actively complained about it. in the space of a year Barnardo's had successfully relocated to a larger premises and had state of the art surveillance put in and other fancy stuff....I was convinced they would never lose that value in stock  over 3 years given that it was 'donated'. <br>  My ex father in law would raise money for Malawi and go out there himself to see that every penny was spent on new roofs for schools etc. The bigger the charity, the more internal theft that goes on and it stinks.|`|S8RL9lieaa	I learnt a long time ago that if any of the money ever reaches its purpose, it is a fraction of what you donate. That being the case I gave my time instead of money helping others. Sad reflection on the charities that do their utmost.|`|AA12349988	Yes I donated and frankly I am outraged.  Like you I gladly gave to help those local residents rebuild their lives - not for a money making scheme!!<br>  <br>  Now a traditional way of life will be lost and proud fishermen will now be wearing flowery shirts and making fcuking Mai Tai's!!!<br>  <br>  Disgusting!|`|fSdSuMHOaa	Yes, we did...but our Parish thought something like this would happen & so they collected donations in kind...blankets, clothes, biscuits, rice, pulses, bags, sleeping bags and books...which was delivered by a group of volunteers from the Parish.|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	Yep, gave about 1500 euros between my family members...<br>  <br>  But donations of individuals is nothing compared to what countries have given, although people could have given more, for sure|`|KBLr2tzZaa	Yeah I remember donating, never thought for one minute that the money would not go to the villagers:(|`|mndLFdnFaa	No, I didn't<br>  The countries that were hit by the tsunami all had/have corrupt governments, so I knew that the money would have never helped the people that it should have.<br>  It's unfortunate.|`|0db2fa5306d1f944ee81fd7666a0ebf8aa	Yes I did and it just goes to show you cannot trust anyone these days. It was assured by the appeal person on  TV that this money would go direct to these poor people. I am so dissapointed. Thanks for pointing it out|`|X1IHaTKEaa	Yes - I donated ￡20 and I would love to know how and where my money was spent.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	I remember I was really poor at that time but when I saw the devastation I was moved to tears. I donated $100 putting it on my credit card.<br>  <br>  Greed abounds all over the world. Corrupt governments who don't care about their own people are stuffing their own pockets.<br>  <br>  The only thing I know is that my heart was where it should be, when I donated. Those who misused the money will one day have to answer for it. My conscious is clear. The bad thing is I probably won't donate again because I know what you said is true. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just reach thru our TVs and computers and hand the money to the poor?|`|8KdWHcJdaa	No I didn′t but wanted to go and help instead, although I am not a qualified person I really wanted to be hands on. Denied.<br>  <br>  I learned a long time ago never to donate to charity, ads seen on t,.v for example for kids starving etc, because the money simply never, ever gets to the people it is asking for. It is eaten up in publicity, salaries, media........<br>  <br>  It′s a sad fact of life.<br>  <br>  But this report of them spending the monies is being used to create a surfing mecca for tourists doesn′t surprise me either. In many poor but beautiful countries the locals struggle to survive whilst the tourists sunbathe unaware of the poverty around them. If I were to be able to afford to visit I would never go, out of principle|`|ZbG4adQmaa	No I didn't.  And I didn't because time and again money that is donated to overseas charities never makes it to the people whom it was collected for and need it!  More often than not it makes its way into the wallet of some corrupt politician or business organisation.<br>  <br>  I now only give to British based charities because of this - yep I know it sounds harsh but until these "scams" are sorted out I don't want my money lining the pocket of someone who should never have received it.  I can understand why you are fuming!
vkIqaFQ1aa	Many of these youngsters have no father figure, they have terrible role models and follow their very bad examples.<br>  <br>  Respect can only really be taught in the home, and from a very early age.<br>  <br>  Until parental responsibility is met by all parents everywhere, nothing can change.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, the only solution I can see is punishment for offenders.<br>  <br>  This I feel, should be in the form of incarceration that provides discipline along with hard work and rehabilitation.  But for this to work it must be done with fairness and no bullying whatsoever. <br>  <br>  At the present, courts deal all too leniently with offenders who are heading into this kind of violence.<br>  They need to show that they are able to mete out appropriate punishments and then do it .  Many offenders at present walk out of court with a smirk on their faces, that needs to be put to and end.|`|4gZ8FUsoaa	I Mean Teenagers today are Faced With bad Role Models .. <br>  Like Celebrities like ( Eminem - 50 Cent - Amy Whitehouse - .... ) Who Do many Drugs and attempted murder and get away from murder .. Also many Countries like Israel who attacked Palestine without any Cause and killed Over a Thousand and Injured Terribly over Tens of Thousands ..<br>  So there has to be a strong governmental movement to reduce crimes and make the world a better place.|`|AA11799767	It all depends on how kids are brought up. These days neither the parents nor the schools discipline (or allowed to discipline) the children. Nobody teaches kids that actions have consequences and nobody instills responsibility for their own actions into them. <br>  I also agree with one poster here who sais that bad celebrity role models contribute to this too. Celebrities seem to get away with drug offences and assault all the time.|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	Ask yourself this...."Why are there more stabbings and killings in one WEEK now than there were in one YEAR in the 40s and 50s?" The answer is simple....killers were executed then, stabbers were given lengthy sentences in drab, austere prisons. Nowadays they are given a (shortened) stint in one of HM's holiday camps (er, sorry, prisons) with state of the art gymnasia (which many a leisure centre would be proud of), flat screen TVs, DVDs, computers etc. A stint in jail now is not something a criminal quakes in his boots about. People serving a 4 year sentence are out in 2...why?? Even murderers (who, as the 'human rights' lot have banned hanging) are not serving a 'life' sentence....they are even debating whether to let Stephen Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who brutally murdered so many innocent girls, out early.<br>  There is no deterrent....so criminals carry on carrying knives, stabbing people for looking at then the 'wrong' way and murdering people. We all know what the solution is but this government (ruled by Brussels) won't even let us have a referendum on the matter...I wonder why.|`|s8nPN7pVaa	I fear that it is too late!<br>  <br>  The situation has progressed so far now that gangs have become self sustaining by the need of modern dispossessed youngsters 'wanting to belong' or the fear of 'not belonging'.<br>  <br>  The situation is now so widespread that these gangs are becoming 'self perpetuating' in that it passes from generation to generation.|`|52pZj3WFaa	Stricter parenting would go a long way. And a reduction to the exposure of violence. It may not making someone violent watching this trash, but it must desensitise them to it. And if what you see doesn't bother you too much, will it ever be stopped?|`|UGyFH75Paa	Parents have to stop allowing their children become so desensitized to violence which is exactly what Movies, Tv, and even cartoons do. They have to do a better parenting job overall.|`|5GPbumauaa	I supose its abotu where you grow up and who you grow up with :)|`|FM6CVh8Faa	What can be done?<br>  <br>  Parents to start proper parenting - children are the responsibility of their parents or guardians.<br>  (I have used the term guardians to cover the situation when original parents have separated/divorced or died and a new partnership is formed.<br>  The excuse sometimes given - "I not responsible for his/her behaviour because I'm not his/her father/mother" is invalid. If you form a new partnership you become responsible for the whole family.<br>  Single parents don't escape either -  like it or not a parent is responsible for the upbringing of their children.)<br>  <br>  <br>  It is they that allow children to watch violent films. cartoons for hours on end. Why? <br>  <br>  It is they that allow children to play violent video games for hours on end. Why?<br>  <br>  It is they that allow children to use the Internet uncontrolled for hours on end. Why?<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't try to file me under killjoy - nothing wrong with films/games/cartoons/Internet but it is the responsibility of parents/guardians to control access to them and to ensure that their (and any other) children see these things in context with the real world i.e. there is a difference between killing on films/games etc and acceptable life in society.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Why do they allow their children to go out on the streets with a knife.<br>  The excuse "I don't know" will not do - they _should_ know.<br>  <br>  If the the above doesn't work then the next stage:-<br>  <br>  Police to start proper policing.<br>  <br>  The PCSO 'experiment' is a failure. Get the proper police who have full powers of arrest out of the cosy warm police stations and out of their warm cars and start policing the streets.<br>  <br>  <br>  If all of the above doesn't work then:<br>  <br>  <br>  Law breakers to be properly punished.<br>  <br>  Fines and ASBOs clearly do not work<br>  A knife is as lethal a weapon as a gun (it could be considered more lethal as it is a silent killer) - it just has a shorter range - if your caught with a gun you go to prison why not the same rules with a knife.<br>  <br>  Parents/guardians of children caught carrying knives should also be punished.<br>   <br>  Parenthood/Guardianship = Responsibility<br>  (Sub-text is - loving your children doesn't mean always saying 'yes' or bowing to peer pressure).<br>  <br>  Most parents/guardians already know this - the minority need to be taught it and if they don't follow the 'rules' they and their children should face rthe consequences..|`|xU7AaQOdaa	The answer is very simple, but Draconian. <br>  <br>  More Visible Policing on the streets, "Stop and Search", and an automatic 5 year prison sentence for any one caught in possession of a Knife or Blade without good cause eg.Carpet Fitters.<br>  <br>  The Police know where the trouble spots are, and where scum live and hang out, and if applied thoroughly, within six months the problem would be greatly alleviated.  <br>  <br>  Now, whether Jacqui Spliff and the rest have the bottle to do this, rather than just talk, I very much doubt.|`|822a369b8f320e09663fcafb542917aeaa	Frankly I wouldn't know where to start on finding a solution.  I think police should be able to carry out stop and searches whenever they feel the need, and carrying a weapon should mean an automatic sentence, but I don't think that would be enough to stop knife crime.<br>  <br>  The kids carrying knives think they are untouchable, and despite knowing being caught would mean a jail sentence, they think they will never be the ones caught.  Some of these kids carry a knife solely because they know what it's like on their streets and who wants to be in a knife fight without a knife?<br>  <br>  Where I grew up, knife crime was quite rife and we all knew people who'd been stabbed and who carried a knife.  The police tried a knife amnesty where people handed in knives anonymously. They came to our school and showed us pictures of stab wounds and tried to scare us.  I'm sure it worked with some people, but it didn't stop other carrying knives.<br>  <br>  My experiences tell me there won't be a solution found, but I really do hope someone somewhere does, and soon.

lg2RfcrQaa	It's crazy. I didn't even know there was such thing. I just thought it was common sense to have somebody manning the beds. <br>  If a 14yr old can go in there then anybody can, hell even an 8yr old could help themselves to 19mins on a sunning bed and do the same damage that young girl did. <br>  What's next? "Help yourself" pubs. You can walk in and help yourself to whatever you like, just be sure to check that you're 18 though.|`|4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	I agree that the salons should be staffed, but as for banning sunbeds ... you are much more likely to get cancer from smoking and no government has ever banned that, probably because they get so much tax revenue from it.<br>  <br>  Protect minors by all means but otherwise, all you can do is inform and educate. Beyond that, it's a personal choice. Banning choices deemed unhealthy by politicians = a nanny state.<br>  <br>  Edit: sorry, I misinterpreted your point. You are totally right about protecting children. I had no idea before I saw this story (and horrible picture) that there were such things as unstaffed, coin-operated salons - it's crazy.<br>  <br>  Don't they have street f@g machines any more? I bought my first packet of 10 Weights from one,and yes, I was under 16, but that was, er, a long long time ago and I gave up smoking before most of you were even born :)|`|s8nPN7pVaa	Yes I agree, where I live there are several Tanning salons, all regulated and staffed.<br>  <br>  The staff keep a record of those using the tanning beds and are not allowed to exceed recommended times for sessions, the timers are set by the by the staff by computer and cannot be over ridden.|`|81Iglngeaa	you have got to be kidding me, who cares..... we have tanning beds in my apartments that no one staffs, do you want someone in there watching you undress and get in a tanning machine

Like young children not having laptops or PC's in their bedrooms, or letting your children use social networking sites etc.<br>  <br>  But to claim that people need to get a life is a bit over the top.  Most people who use Facebook, etc also have a good social life, and use these sites as a way to share photo's, etc.<br>  <br>  I think people need to have a balance, but it is up to the individual what they choose to spend their spare time doing.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	I think it depends on how you use Facebook etc.  If you don't actually have a life in the real world it's sad, but you can use it to keep in touch with relatives and friends who live far away and it's excellent for that. <br>  <br>  I have a lot of relatives in California and Oregon that I only see once every three or four years, and friends around the world; it's lovely to get little glimpses into their lives, but doesn't replace phone calls, letters and actually meeting up now and then!|`|81Iglngeaa	hahahahhahahaha<br>  naw doesnt sound to wise to me, thats assuming that people who get on social networking sites dont have a life in the first place, i dont agree with that|`|vRAtZSpmaa	You should do what you want with life yuuuup :D <br>  <br>  Its up to you how you spend your life<br>  They dont know what theyre on about half the time ..|`|17c52f4edd6d7f16af927ed4774ff0e8aa	For me it is summed up in "Social networking sites should allow us to embellish our social lives, but what we find is very different. The tail is wagging the dog. These are not tools that enhance, they are tools that displace."<br>  <br>  Those who are hooked on Facebook are in no state to express a view on it. Asking them to express an opinion on Facebook would be like asking a drunk about the effect of alcohol (on the human body). (Is the drunk in a fit state of mind to express a valid opinion?)|`|e32684a77581aa18d840700cb6c46be1aa	It depends, I am on there and as far as I am concerned it is just a bit of fun, I probably visit for 10 mins once a week, but I believe some people spend hours and hours on there, in such a case the words are probably wise|`|20BKec9aaa	Its kinda funny since most people associate Facebook with having a life but its true people who are on Facebook all day are just like those who are on the computer doing other randomness.|`|l9aXZ3poaa	It's common sense that there should be a balance in these things.

Not because I don't believe the person the story is about, but because I know how souless and ruthless the British press can be, and they never print a story without a slant on it.<br>  <br>  These magazines, newspapers, etc that are selling these stories today, are the same ones that ripped her apart a few years ago.  She's no dummy, and she is playing the press to her own advantage.

Are you typing this from yr trailer as you watch Jeremy Kyle or equivalent, on benefits ?   What sort of Q is this ?  Love her or loathe her she has highlighted the need for young women globally to go and insist on a Smear test as many say 20's is still too young !  This proves not.  Jade has done more to highlight cervical cancer than anyone else could have done.  People become "famous" for all manner of reasons - some good, some bad.  Shilpa Shetty has asked for people to forget the past herself and wished Jade well for her wedding.  Jade will eventually be remembered for being the person that "saved" other young women by her own ill plight.  Jade's news sadly is correct - to consider this as merely a publicity stunt is appalling to say the least.  She has weeks/months to live and is trying to generate as much revenvue as she can to secure a solid future for her boys.  I only hope the news headlines in say 10yrs time is NOT about the trustees having their fingers in the till and so sadly there is nothing left.<br>  <br>  If you are fed up with the news then consider next few years with ..... Jade .... a year on.     Jade .... a life without her.  She will still be making millions when she is dead.  Elvis does it, John Lennon does it, Princess Diana does it, Ray Charles, Mother Theresa, Monet etc etc.  They are all making money AFTER their deaths.

He is still a serving prisoner, but has a tag and a curfew. That curfew means that he must be in a certain place at a certain time and knowing that they should have made plans around it. This is as we are all aware is a publicity stunt and is fueled by a desire to get as much cash as possible. No harm in that and I doubt they have made any arrangements. This has been left to a wedding planner who omitted one small detail, the wedding night. We then have Max Clifford pleading on her behalf to let them spend their wedding night together, well nobodies stopping them are they.

Oh and guns should be restricted to MIlitary and Law Enforcement use only, I think we should have specific government owned placed that make individual guns and monitor their usage, but the whole violent society thing does play a part in it. Abortion is wrong, your killing, its not you its a totally different being merely inside of you and just because your mom is a ..... sleeping with everyone she sees and you came at the wrong time doesn't mean that you should have to suffer. (I would set up abortion centers where they collect the babies and put them in artificial wombs therefore they could be easily adopted and if they aren't they become the goverments children) I think Draft Dodging is fun unless necessary (forget the army join the NAvy and explore the sea) if their is a group or nation that is killing off the majority of the population (like if their were to be nuclear bombings and chemical warfare put aginst my nation then I would at least try to defend it, but not use it as an exuse to invade another country, destroy their culture and enslave their people).

With the liberal UN and media in the region, it is hard to get the truth, but based on facts, the adults of "Palestine" place their own children in this danger. I honestly do feel bad for any children that die over there, but the cause is the hatred, and way of life of the fanatics in that region. All the fanatic men in the region should take the fight away from their homes and families, instead of cowering behind them. That's what Israel does. They are smart enough, and thoughtful enough to not place their innocent civilians in danger.

I think a lot of newspapers will go under.<br>  <br>  People like to read good writing and the stories in magazines tend to be the kind of narrative writing we enjoy.  Information is more in-depth, mainly because of the time to produce the magazine.  <br>  <br>  Newspapers have become a travesty in the last few decades.  News is based on a style that provides the relevant information presented in the first paragraphs and the less relevant further down so that the article can be cut if more inches are needed for advertising.  It seems that when you buy a newspaper now, you are paying for the advertising and very little news that can't be obtained from other, faster media sources.  Newspapers have not adapted.  I think the style needs to be changed to provide enjoyable reading material.  I regret that this is the case, as I think newspapers are a part of our culture, and I don't want to see them fade.|`|ZzJmUerpaa	depends on the market.--one thing for sure there will be a lot of ny post cancellations and daily news subscriptions.--why anybosy wwould put a penny in zionist murdoch's pocket is beyond me.--but people are realizing that fox news is garbage and so is the post.|`|NehnjjQtaa	the only shocker i have witnessed regards to all news reporters is the following there use to be a day when news reporters dared to report all the following and trust me i have to use this as an example. it use to be that everything elvis presley ever did was reported via local news. from all elvis was so very capable of doing from 1,drugging his own wife,2,shooting out tv's. 3,visiting grave yards and funeral parlors with one linda thompson,or thompkins)4.playing jokes on his closest buddies,5,from elvis presley's own hospital stays, 6.to elvis presley flying off in the middle of the wee hours of the morning to fly off to washington d.c to meet with former president of the united states of america one Richard R.Nixon just so he (elvis presley could be made an honary f.b.i drug agent, 7.then suddenly we all heard the king had suddenly dies, 8. during the funeral one actress connie stevens was caught by reporters during funeral as saying that is not elvis presley in that casket,9.a week after the funeral why even priscella while at graceland was awoken from her sleep as the horses in the stables were making a ruckus,,any way reporters interviewed her ,as she sawa a bright night ,and laughed and mocked her saying what she saw was a ghost,, 10. former taxi sta/wrestler, andy kauffman was even reported live on television as saying the following :if elvis presely can fake his own death than i can too,,and all that followed yet to date of february 20,09!!  had it not been for the local news now where would you think i would have gotten all this but from local news ,tv,and even radio my friend....so you see as for the furture of printed newspapers and magazines have been quite dim for some time ,as they reported all this but not one sole ever dared to question the king or all that had knew him best..being priscella, his closest buddies, joe espezedo, nor do they to date...it is just so shocking and appalling about checking true facts and information as all reporters use to be more raw and cut throat for having a late breaking news story..!!!  and thanks for asking such an excellent question..hope this helps..as some things regarding elvis presley should never be forgotten!!
