Check the Video out and tell me has he crossed the line?       http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/multime...     50 Cent has released a video with the mother of Rick Ross' son. The woman, identified as Tiallondra "Tia" Kemp, confirmed she is the mother of William Roberts III, the rapper's 2-year old son.      With 50 asking questions, Kemp explains her relationship with her child's father.      "It's sort of embarrassing, as you listen to his raps, you would definitely believe him," Kemp states. "His jewelry is rented, the cars are being leased…It's just sad. I just want to prove the facts."      Regarding the controversy last summer of Ross' stint as a corrections officer, Kemp confirms the story to be true. She claims the rapper lied to her about his previous employment when they lived together. According to Kemp, her suspicions were confirmed after speaking with the Miami rapper's sister and finding resignation documents.      50 also makes a distinction between Kemp and Brooke, the mother of Ross' daughter. 50 alleges the latter is a high-end call girl.      Further in the video, Kemp confirms the recent story of Ross taking back a truck he had given her, which followed a heated child support deposition over the rapper's assets.      "I've been driving it for 2 years. I was very surprised he would take it," Kemp stated. "Right now I have to get someone to pick me and the kids."      Later, 50 proclaims his intentions to show Kemp a great time, stating slyly "we gonna do some shopping, have a good time and then…y'all can't see all of that!"      After further insulting Ross by showing a personal picture of his mother and referring to her as the Nutty Professor, the viral video shows Tia Kemp being taken around to various shopping boutiques to pick up shoes and furs on 50's tab. Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely" is utilized as the soundtrack.

I watched Sailor Moon Classic and Sailor Moon R series, which are episodes 1-89, and those are great. (Well, some are a little silly, but at least they do finally get seriously worthwhile at the end.)      But so far Sailor Moon S has been one LONG commercial for female homosexuality. This bores and annoys me. I feel as if I'm being arrogantly preached at by a politically correct feminist with an IQ under 85.      Each episode takes me 5 hours or so to download. If Sailor Moon S isn't going to get any better, I might as well quit. Advice?

20090202171734AAvDM3R	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	What do you think of the show The Office, especially if you've been a longtime viewer?	I've watched (and re-watched constantly) The Office on NBC. But in previous season and the current season, I just feel as though I'm not getting as much pleasure from it.        Pam looks old and dowdy, rather than young and fresh - I mean, she's wearing black hose and pumps to work, rather than her Keds and button-down shirts.  She seems far less vulnerable, and too often, she's just whiny or annoying when she's around Jim.        Jim seems to be treading in the waters of retarded sexuality, now that his major plotline is resolved.        Dwight is far less sympathetic than he's ever been (and I love his angry, Nazi-esque demeanor in the previous seasons, but he was still a guy to root for back then).        Kelly shouldn't even be on the show anymore - her character has gone through the most transitions since the show's inception, but rather than become a more complex character, she's far more shallow, stupid, and pointless than any other conceivable creature on television.        Finally, Michael: he's floundering around, searching for a decent plotline to keep him from drowning in the asinine drivel that's written for him. His goofs are stale and redundant.       So, after that venting, I'd like to know your opinion of the show. Do you feel that The Office is suffering or has it improved? And please be specific - are there particular episodes or characters that work or don't work for you?

The dolphins they were whispering love songs to the waves,   So I chased them down and asked them to sing me the song.   I sat you down and filled your glass I broke my leg to get you there,   Your the angel that is fended off my nightmares.      I will strum a chord just for you, it's all that I know how to do,   So in the Summertime your skin shines bright.   I want to fold up my past and put it away under my bed,   So I can focus on the future and the time that we have left to spend.

In voice lessons I asked her if I had a talent for singing and she said yes, and then I asked if I had potential, and she said "You'll never be a Christina Aguilera" (which I knew) but kept going on about how I could be in church choirs and SOMETIMES sing solos, and this really hurt. I wanted to audition for American Idol, because I feel like I couldn't really make anything out of my life if I didn't do something like that. I feel like if I'm not famous I won't amount to anything, and wanted to be on American Idol. So her telling me that I could be in a choir and SOMETIMES sing solos, really hurt, how should I handle this?

One of my friends, Elysia, showed me her iPod, and I was a little less upset. Then I got to a song called 30 Minutes by t.A.T.u., and I was completely mesmerized. I went to amoeba the next day and got a new cd by t.A.T.u. called 200 khm/In the Wrong Lane. So I started listening to it on the way to school.. Then at lunch.. Then in every class, all the time. I LOVE that band. I'm happy and mesmerized by AWESOME music. The four main instruments in all their songs is the Guitar, the Drums, the Xylophone (Cool!) and the Violin (these were DANCE and ROCK songs!!). That's when it hit me: American music SUCKS. I never realized what I was missing. This Russian band showed me this. Does anyone know of any sort of foreign band?    I was hoping for a:   -Dance, Pop, or Rock band   -English versions as well as native language versions   -A twist.. Something that makes them unique      NO STUPID LYRICS! My friend showed me this band called CSS.. Ugh. What kind of song is called "alala"? It's worse then american music.. No offense to the fans of CSS out there..

I am a Taurus and I feel I loose points and pride because of this Scorpio guy, but seems if I decide to forget about him, I will and would not come back. But both of us do not want to hurt each other. Maybe he was thinking to forget me too but we end up being weird with each other and does not how to behave. My only reason for not abandoning the friendship is because I am caring for people's feelings which I do not want to hurt and I know he doesn't want to hurt me either. But we constantly hurt each other unconsciously and we even do now know how to behave adequately. If we try to ignore each other, one of us comes back to the other, if we try to get closer one of us rejects the other. I am really wondering will it be a winner and a looser at the end, or just two losers?

I had a dream, that everything wasnt the way it seemed, my vision was clearer and i knew what i wanted to be. I was not dependent on someone or anything. Dreams were doable and in my life i was just a king. But now i had to wake up and face up everything, with sword in a hand and stick in the other, with lie on the tongue and in my mind just another, i never wanted that i wanna relax.

I've been play guitar for 1 year now and I still can't tune a guitar or identify simple tone. i'm not tone deaf, but when I try to tune, the 5th fret and the next open string sound nothing alike to me. I know they have different "tone" but the same pitch, I just don't hear it. And I've heard people say, don't use tuners or tabs. But I disagree, I think if you don't use tuners, then your never gonna know what an in tune guitar sounds like. And you can't not use tabs. I mean I try to figure songs out, but some songs are just too hard to figure. Any help would be appreciated.      Also, any easy songs I could try to figure out would be much appreciated thanks.

What else could I add, or change. Would another prank do better? Some help would be greatly appreciated!

( member since: )   chicago, IL - USA                From: Kirk F. / 0336818    To: Danae D. / 0333505    Date / Time: Jan 14, 2009 - 5:35 PM    Subject: Fox Models Showcase Event Caesars Palace June 7    Message: Hi, My name is Kirk Fox, one of the owners of Fox Models International. We are an international model scouting company holding live model showcase search events throughout the country. Our next live showcase event will be in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace on Sunday, June 7th. We saw your profile on Models.com and we think you have a good look and should consider attending our Las Vegas showcase.       We have been in the modeling business for over 10 years and have placed many aspiring models at the top agencies in New York. Some of our discoveries include Edythe Hughes represented by Elite New York and Leigh Yeager represented by Marilyn. The top agencies know of our reputation as the best for finding great new talent. At our last live model search event in Atlanta on December 7th, 8 attendees were signed to contracts with agencies such as Ford, Wilhelmina and Trump. At least 6 other Atlanta attendees are going to New York this month to meet with agencies such as One and IMG that are interested in signing them.       We are bringing in most of New York's top agencies to our Las Vegas showcase. Ford, Wilhelmina, Next, Trump, Marilyn, Women and Ford are all bringing representatives to our event. We may have more coming as we get closer to June 7th.       Please check out our website at www.fmilive.com. The site will explain more about the Las Vegas event and includes many videos with highlights of our past live events and interviews with the scouting directors of the New York agencies and also with parents and attendees of our shows. Yes we do charge a fee for our showcase events because we are real and there are people that attend our showcase that get signed. The agency directors come to our events looking to sign people as they know we have the best eye for new talent and we are very selective, we do not take anybody and everybody, you must have real potential for a modeling career. There are no guarantees you will be signed, it is very competitive but we know we put on the most credible model search event at the fairest price in the industry and that we give you the best opportunity to be discovered by the top NY agencies.       If you are under the age of 18 we need to talk with your parent or guardian. If you would like more specific information, please feel free to email me at kirk@fmilive.com. We look forward to hearing from you.       Sincerely,       Keith, Kirk and Steve Fox    Fox Models International    www.fmilive.com             I was really excited when I got the message but my mother insisted that it was bullshit because they asked to pay a fee. What do you think? Someone please help me out a bit? Thank you.

There's a scene where this woman wakes up a hibernating fire/lava giant to destroy these multi eyed caterpillar things and the giant ends up dying quickly and all that are left is bones. In the end the girl is injured protecting a baby caterpillar thingy. This caterpillar baby was kidnapped in an effort to draw out the adult caterpillars I believe. She ends up being healed by the tendrils of the caterpillars. And walks across their tendrils and it looks like a golden field. These Caterpillar things eyes turn red when mad and blue when not mad.

I've just talked with a friend of mine, he had just started to pursue a Solo carer , because he loves music very much, just like me, but unfortunately, and rather sadly, just this afternoon, he poured all his heart that , as I quoted from him, "being musician in indonesia is just f*ckin hard & doesn't make sense! it's just so dirty often, and hard to get recognized, and with piracy running rampant, greedy labels, very low purchasing-power from still-poor people in the mainstream, etc etc"  , and he's even thinking of just concentrating in the business-aspect , not the artistic-side anymore in the music "industry". He's planning to just start a label & draw new artists,....instead of following his TRUE passion to become a full-time musician!      so then, i start asking myself this: if career as musician is really hard to make money, then why so many people still want to be a musician ??   why? what do you think?   do you think these people (musicians) are probably just 'naive' people who don't know that it's a cruel cruel world in a music, no, actually, music-business world.  'cuz often there're more to it than only making good & creative tunes.  this i've unfortunately & pitifully learned at least in my corrupt country, Indonesia, where sadly, music is just another corrupt tool. and that's why no wonder a lot of musicians/bands are just poor, & even some really great/talented ones is lacking so much appreciations from mainstream people, instead, many people generally only prefer for 'stupid' songs/music as long with good looks, and many other artificial/fake things!   and i'm sure the situation is no different even in advanced countries like U.S, Europe, Japan, etc.  blatantly-and-honestly speaking, many people are just plain stupid, don't understand 'good music' from 'bad music' , and most big-players in the so-called "music-business" are all crooked and greedy, all they think is only money, not enhancing/supporting their artists/bands!!   and plus, there're just soo many, and damn many competitions in this arena, it's like every week, there are like ten or even twenty bands being born (or more??) !      with all of these sad things above, i've recently often wondered & kept wondering, is there still any point for any person, no matter how talented or even multi-talented or passionate he/she is at music, to pursue career as a musician (and espcially, FULL-time musician) ?   are they just out of their mind?   but the Reality seems to speak differently: there are surprisingly an increasing amount of musicians (ie: bands, usually "indie" bands)!   why is this?  what is the reasons for they kept wanting to be a musician?

20090202190608AAiKmig	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Kyle XY- Why the teenage stereotypes?	Well, I was watching tonight's new episode on ABC... and I noticed two things. First, whenever teens do something "bad", why are they always caught by someone? I know that it is supposed to demonstrate the consequences of one's mistakes but lets face it, the consequences don't always come immediately. Parents calling their kids out on a wild night of partying EVERY time is simply not realistic. I don't believe that Kyle and his friends were caught by parents in the episode, just the crazy tow truck guy-- I didnt see the whole episode. Regardless of that fact, in most teen TV shows like this, the partyers are caught, punished thoroughly, then forgiven. And as a result, they never make the same mistake again. This simply is not always so clear cut in real life. Not that this observation is really that significant, idk... just frustrating. Ha.      But what really bothers me is this- WHY is teen drinking seen as "ok" and as "inevitable experimentation", while usage of marijuana is always taboo? In light of the recent Michael Phelps incident, I was just thinking about how if the kids on Kyle XY had been smoking pot, 1) I'm sure they would have had Kyle say no, as he is the "upstanding moralistic hero of the show" and 2) A cop would probably have ended up bringing the kids home- rather than them surviving unscathed as they did from the drinking incident.   This is despite the fact that it has been clearly proven that consumption of alcohol leads people to be more violent- hence the incidence of bar fights, crazy drunk drivers who think they are invincible, etc. Why is it that its "okay" for Kyle to experiment by drinking, learn his lesson, and resume his role as heroic teen heartthrob?       Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant... The hypocrisy of American culture just really frustrates me sometimes.
