SF1uPJZhaa	Please post it in English, because Google ruined some sentences so bad that I have no clue what they were meant to say.    edit: Ich bin nicht sportlich. Ich wei?, dass Sport fr meine Gesundheit wichtig ist, aber ich finde einfach nicht die Zeit. Au?erdem gibt es in Prishtina nicht viele M?glichkeiten. Ich denke, dass ich Eislaufen versuchen werde. Ich mag es, und man lernt Balance zu halten. Basketball gef?llt mir auch.  Es hat Spa? gemacht, als wir in der Schule gespielt haben. Einmal habe ich Windsurfen versucht und es geliebt. Ich wrde auch gern Surfen lernen. Ich glaube, dass ich versuchen werde zuknftig etwas sportlicher zu sein.
CQo3Y0Jmaa	I saw the last episode.    Mckay was with the Dr    Teyla was standing next to Ronan at the end but he is with some blonde and Wussy was standing with the Scottish Dr and Sheppard comes in and they all look at the golden gate bridge but I do not know if she was with anyone in the end because her husband died by Michael I believe.    I hope that helps some.|`|2TKKTW6saa	No, Teyla's husband (meaning, the father of the child Torren), did not die. She still is with him and his name is Kanaan.    Although there IS the small problem of Kanaan having been left behind in Pegasus in the finale, but I'm sure they're gona fix that in the movies ;)

on6dC4A8aa	That I always have to get my way...discovered at a slumber party where 9 different people wrote in my "slam book" that "She's a lot of fun to be around, but always has to have her own way." I didn't realize it til then, but considering that EVERYONE wrote it, I thought there must be something to it (of course, they'd always let me have my own way, so I didn't realize anyone had a problem with it :)|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Probably that I like to be "Right" too much.

And that, turns into an even bigger problem... jealousy.

Its weird.|`|aIakDSstaa	Because she was subservient to him, I guess that's the idea of white power is it not.|`|aUScPZFYaa	Because, they hated us so much that they wanted us.

AA10181795	Government-backed prevention would be interfering with our freedom, am I right? Was that a trick question?|`|AA12382198	A very curvy road where I grew up had multiple accidents whenever it rained or snowed.....ice forget it.    My brother's fiance was driving on the road one day during a light rain and another car plowed into her and killed her instantly.....she was 26.    After that.....they straightened out the roadway to make it more straight.    We were told she was the 8th fatality and that was the magic number.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Have heard, but can't verify, that it requires a certain number of deaths to justify the expense of installing a light or sign and that in this area, the number is 4.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	You can see why, can't you? It doesn't mean that it's ok or that it makes sense. They might go overboard or make a bad situation worse.     There have been fatalities on a state highway near where we live and nothing has been done. I'm not clear on the speed limit. There is not a sign where our street meets it nor up the way to the first traffic light. I see people going at least 50 mph down to 30 mph. Nothing has been done to lower the speed limit.     I think it should be lowered because of heavy traffic and many side streets. Wal-Mart is in the area. People are stupid where I live. Seriously there was an article in the paper about people driving like idiots, more ore less.     They drive like idiots everywhere but they are really bad where I am. (outside the norm)|`|ZzDdG6yVaa	Bceause we live in a time where the government reacts to what happens instead of could happen.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	That is what usually happens. Next time the governing body should be sued for not fixing the danger. Then they will put up a traffic signal or signs.|`|Q2Iq5RCYaa	Its not really the fatal accident, but rather there goes another tax payerlol|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	It's always that way & what a shame. Once there have been fatalities, then the people are up & arms about getting traffic lights installed. How many deaths does it have to take before the city/county wakes up & takes charge?  The same goes with unprotected water filled ditches along highways, railroad crossings that have no gates & lights, etc.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	That is just the way our government works. . . When something bad happens and the media get a hold of it, then government finally acts. . . They try to push things under the rug as long as possible. . till they are forced to do something.. . I think they are trying to save the money it would take to fix something, and put it in their own pockets instead !|`|G4vFjh0yaa	We have two areas outside of the city that are a constant problem and they do "studies" and more "studies" and nothing has been done.

799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	No, I wouldn't allow it, but he is 18 so there isn't really much you can do.  But what you can do is withold the money for college from him.  Stand firm and tell him that whatever is left of that money is for college only.    Also, I am sorry that your daughter spent most of his college money.  It sounds like your grandson is turning out to be a prodigal grandson.  I will pray for you.|`|6ozmjp3xaa	Wish  him Godspeed and save the money he will need to get back home, when he realize the other life was not what he expected|`|G4vFjh0yaa	18 is a time for adventure. We were all naive at one point in this life.  If he is capable and willing to suffer the life insults when the "know it all"mentality is in jeopardy then I would think that he needs the time to grow up.  He will be calling gram for money so I would hang on to that for sure.  It took thee military to help me to grow up. It isn't for everyone, but it did help me and the futture I was able to have.  Good luck gram.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	No...I would not finance the trip...but I would do what I could to express my concerns, if he were that highly intelligent, print stats on the ratio of crime of internet scams and kidnappings, then send him on his way, with no, NO money.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Tell him good bye, keep safe, keep in touch (often). Keep the money for when he turns 25 and is a little more mature. Unless he goes to college before turning 25.    Also take out a $10,000 term life insurance policy on him for funeral costs. Life is not very kind or nice to the young and naive.|`|7fHsyHYraa	He is ready for adventure and you can't stop him from leaving.  Keep the college money, he may decide attend college one day.  Give him a kiss and a hug and tell him to please call you often.  If he leaves with your blessing then he will free to return home when he has had enough of life on his own.  Who knows, he may find happiness and success on the other side of the country.  One thing is for sure he will soon get an education in the school of hard knocks and will no longer be naive.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I think I would let him go on his way.  At 18 he thinks he knows it all and nothing you say will change his  mind.  Just pray for him.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	Get what is left of the money back that you can. Cut him loose and let him find his way. My wife has a sister who has 2 grandsons and they have milked that poor woman into poverty. And both have gone to prison for drugs. One got out last summer and immediately started  sponging again. She cut him off so he got married and is letting his new wife take care of him. His older brother is still in the pen (second time) And owes so much child Support, he is better off to stay there. If there grandmother hadn't ponied up all her money for them when they were younger, I believe they would have turned out better and she wouldn't be broke! They show absolutely no responsibility what so ever! I believe if someone is going to sink themselves regardless of what others have done for them, they should sink alone. Sad, but realistic.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	All you can do at this point, is to let him try his wings. Don't give him  money, as tempting as it must be. He needs to fall on his face   sooner than later, and learn how tough it is out there. And when he  calls you collect, tell him he's welcome to come back. But he'll have  to live by your rules. Or new rules. In that, he has to get a job, and  produce a decent paycheck, which he will put most of aside in a  bank in his first account. When he's worked at menial labor at fast  food or whatever he can get after several months of seeing how hard  it is to make a few dollars an hour, encourage him to go to a trade  school or take some courses, to better his offerings financially in the  job market. Have him pay you a little rent money for food, as that's  all he'll basically be taking away from you. And either put it aside,  into a savings bond, or spend it for food. If into a bond, then when  they've reached maturity down the road, give them to him to put into  the bank or a savings account, and let him save it for a rainy day.  If he's staying with you, he'll be able to save up to get his own place  and move out on his own. But he won't be able to do that working at  a fast food. He'll have to move up in the job market first. Often we  have to teach our kids and grandkids, that life is hard. It often is a  struggle for most of us. And he has to pull his own weight and help  himself. Nothing will come to you, you have to go out and grab what  you can, by working hard, paying your bills,and learning how to min-  imize those each month, by curbing the use of each utility you can.  Learning to survive without much money will be the hard part until he  can discipline his spending and his wants. There's no need to   sacrifice your money for someone that won't appreciate it. He has to  see how many hours he has to work, to earn the amount you'd like to  give him, before it will teach him what he has to do to survive. And  hopefully, he will learn, and learn fast. As tempting as it will be, let  him learn you are there for him for support, but not financial support.  He's got to have the struggles and rethink what has to be done.|`|4LsF70cjaa	If talking to him doesn't work then I can't stop him but I also don't have to finance his foolishness.  But I would hold onto the money because life does have a way of changing people and chickens usually come home to roost so he may not yet be a lost cause.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	There is nothing you can do , now.  Sadly it is out of anyone's hands.  He is old enough to make his own mistakes, and it sounds as if that is just what he is going to do.  If you feel that you want to give him some money, do it a small amount at a time.  Tell him that you have an emergency fund for him, but will not give it to him, just for anything.  He will have to prove to you that it will be going to a worth while action.    If I were in your position, I would let him know that I do not agree with what he is doing, but that you will always be there for him.   You still love him, don't you?  That is what unconditional love is all about.   Years down the road, he could probably turn himself around.   Or, the decision he will be making soon, will turn out O.K.  One doesn't really know. does one.|`|e619d75c8abe72d3aef67c55cea22841aa	If you're unable to stop him, then, you have no choice.  But, you don't have to give him money.  If he's mature enough to make the move, he's mature enough to provide his own finances.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Unfortunately by the time a person is 18 all we can do is try to reason with them. My step son moved out on his 18th birthday. He ended up spending the last 2 months at different friends homes and wearing out his welcome. He learned the hard way that things weren't really so bad here. He ended up spending a few nights sleeping in his car with an empty belly and has since acknowledged he was VERY naive.  You can't stop him but I wouldn't encourage him either. He's going to have to learn his lesson from the school of hard knocks. It's a difficult time to try to strike out on your own if you're only 18 and not planning on going to college.  I wouldn't give him the money if I didn't agree with his choice. If that money was set aside for college, I'd hold on to it for a while. He doesn't sound mature enough to make good financial decisions. When he comes back in a few years and tells you he regrets not going to school you can tell him there is still time and $ for him to do so. Good luck. I'm sure his intelligence will win over his impulsiveness, just give it time.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	If he was my grandson, I'd have him visit a recruiting office & sign up to join the service. He'll enter as a naive boy & exit as a man. I think all males need to serve their time in the branch of their choice. They can get a great "free" education, free medical/dental care, & learn about life. As for the money that is set aside for college that you feel he won't enter, keep it in a savings account for him to use when his hitch is up. It's a nest egg he'll look forward to while he's saving his money from his service pay.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	This is an interesting question as we too have a grandson we are raising. He is only 9 but in a few years he too may want to leave and not go to college. Any money we save for his college is just that. He must have some sort of job if he wants to 'explore' far from home, save up his own money At 18 you can not hold him back, he is an adult. Just wish him the best, if he won't listen to you. Just be there in case he finds there is no pot of gold at the end of his rainbow.   Good luck, Poppy|`|GrKiEDb1aa	My eldest did that without telling anyone.  He was last seen Thursday morning at work.  Late Saturday afternoon he called to tell us he was in Kansas City, KS (we live in S.E. Virginia).  He was headed to California to 'SURF BIG SUR!'  He wound up in San Diego...much further south.  He came home, went back in 94, came home in 96, went back 6 years ago and is still there, very succesful ( 3 in a new construction plumbing company).|`|nwnILcEAaa	Save the money that is left for when he needs it later. We all have to experience a few 'knocks' in order to grow up. It would be better if he were in the military or in college, but this is the path he has chosen. There are some who never grow up and show up constantly with their hand out waiting for someone to give them help and never run out of excuses as to why they need helping. If he learns to be self-supporting, then good for him.
HK00RPDtaa	I have a 4.0 GPA, and I'm not a nerd.|`|kOMWiTlNaa	Nerds are extinct now, in fact they most likely never existed, only concocted by hollywood and readily accepted as real by society's children.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	There is nothing wrong with being a nerd.  If you can maintain a 4.0 average, I would say that you're doing pretty good for yourself.  If doing good in school and for yourself is bad, then I don't want to be good.    However, Being intelligent can be a pain in the butt at times. Less intelligent people will ask you an  excessive amount of questions irrelevant to why you're intelligent.  Some people just don't understand that you don't know all the answers to life.    Don't let people drag you down, because you aren't a miscreant like they are.      Note:  Nerds are usually the ones that become billionaires, and get lots of women later on in life.|`|fpU8rIleaa	a nerd is someone who actually likes studying all day every day even on the weekends and don't know how to have fun ur just smart if u have a 4.0 GPA if ur good in math then ur just good in math

TGfwEtUPaa	Hola Rachele,    It is a tragedy that your father does not want to teach you to learn spanish.  However, It is never too late to learn.  Take a course in spanish in your school if there is any or in college. Most colleges have spanish classes. Hang out with friends who speak spanish.  Watch tv in spanish.  Read the newspaper from puerto rico elnuevodia.com And use the dictionary to translate words.  Watch TV in spanish. Believe it or not, even by watching novelas you can pick up on some spanish. Watching TV was how I learned english when I was in Puerto Rico.  Ask your mom if you could go on a trip to Puerto Rico to visit your family members over there.  A summer in puerto rico does wonders for you.  I know plenty of people who have picked it up by just going to PR  in a summer.  Get some books in Spanish from your local library. Buy books in spanish or ask your mother to buy you books from Amazon.com and even Walmart has some in spanish.  When you rent movies, watch them in spanish. Most of them offer either subtitles in spanish or a translated version.    So key aspects:  Read books in spanish  Watch TV or Movies in Spanish      Try this websites:  http://www.studyspanish.com/pronunciatio...  http://www.donquijote.org/    Its awesome to know that you are interested in learning spanish. Most kids your age want nothing to do with their roots!  Thumbs up!!!|`|na8ObA5Haa	you dont need anything with rosetta, its an amazing website and thats all you need.|`|bd5c7de49b15ec5ce776bd359797a407aa	Try this website:    http://www.mansionspanish.com  .|`|jC2Nj4PFaa	Hi my name's Marco i'm italian and i'm 15, i study english and spanish in italy, the spanish for us italian is so easy than english! are languages neo-latines, anyway i think that is too late for learn the Spanish! in to the web site you can't learn good! in Puerto Rico don't exist a school that teach the Spanish??if you want my contact of msn let me know..bye    ps: you live in heaven, puerto rico it's so cool! it's beatiful, fantastic!! i live in Caltanissetta in the centre of sicily! For me Puerto Rico it's a dream!

bMuwuAVOaa	Here is the story about the haunting I experienced...http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-GbKj1XQ8e...  Peace&love be with you...~M~|`|JUviY9hoaa	I used to live in an OLD OLD apartment complex in the montrose area of Houston. A few years before we moved in, there was an old couple that was beaten to death in there sleep. Tragic. Well, my mom and I had these two skeleton dolls that were about 3 feet tall and dressed in a ball gown and a tuxedo. The women skeleton was holding a rose and the man held her arm. Almost the day after we had put them out, they started getting moved around. We had them facing into the house, not out the window, as the entertainment center was in front of our window, yet every morning, when we would get up for work and school, both the dolls would be turned around facing OUT the window in the direction of the apartment that older couple had lived in.     Well soon after that, we moved our dog back to our apartment. She had been an apartment dog all her life.. nothing new. Once we brought her into the new house, she started freaking out all the time. She would whimper like she was scared. Always jumpy... would stand at the door and growl. Just acted completely bizarre. One time I came home from school to find she a pee'd herself and was whimpering cowered in a corner... she acted as if a bear was trying to eat her. We moved out of that apartment 6 months after we moved because things would disappear and my mom could swear she heard screaming at night.|`|4CsGde1qaa	I love haunting moments, especially when they're real. One time, I went to a museum, but not just any museum, it was a museum of the holiness. Well, I saw figures, statues, images, and writings of God and other holy people related to him. They were all mostly made of wax. While I was being toured around the museum, I decided to stop when I saw a statue of Jesus being crucified on that "T" shaped piece of wood. That wax figure of him looked so REAL, I even thought it was possible to be real. I stared at it directly in its eyes, saying to myself(this is nothing but an image of what we believe God may have looked like, but it is fake and it is impossible for that wax statue to move.) WRONG!! Exactly 3 minutes, and 33 seconds after staring at him, his eyes changed direction and suddenly faced me directly, but here is the scary part, his eyes began tf drip tears od sadness for like NO REASON!! I was so scared, even though he is the great one, I was so terrified. Since that day, I dare look at another wax person for as long as I live!! Just kidding, I mean the story is True, but I wouldn't mind staring at eyes like those again, and again. The sensation is thermoSonic to my system.|`|vn16f38naa	When I was little my great great grandmother had passed away. Well,  we lived in the house next to hers. It was really weird though, because considering my mother is a witch, and my grandmother knew this, she began to attack the electronics in our home when she passed away. Basically stating she had no idea what the hell was going on. The same happened with my grandfathers 2nd wife, and my grandmother's (my grandfather had once been married to her) 2nd husband. It was very scary. My mom tells me there's an old man living in our hallway, which she can sense. People shouldn't be afraid of these things, so don't be if it ever occurs to you.  Other things that have happened to my grandmother is that her dead 2nd husband continues to turn lights on in her house, but technically, none of these things are considering hauntings. They're considered hellos or warnings.

I would go body surfing every day if I lived there.  And my mom had also rented a convertible for the week and a half we were there, and the sights were just amazing.

But I have to tell you this, you see, I'm a Christian.  Oddly enough, the best day of my life was also one of the most trying days of my life.  My sister had just called me on the phone to tell me that my mother had passed away.  She went into the hospital Friday night, and she was gone Saturday, just like that.      I remember sitting in a chair at home and I was so in shock, I felt nothing, I thought nothing, I was just sitting there.  All of a sudden the spirit of God brought before me John 3:16, "for God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life".  I realized that my mother, a believer, was with the Lord.  I also realized, at that exact moment, if that promise was true, then all of them were true.    That changed my life and I've stood on His word ever since.
elVryMQUaa	I came to the conclusion a couple years ago that it was useless to debate religion. Debates never convince anyone. As a christian I could never be convinced god doesn't exists and my transformation to non belief was a personal thing caused by my own questioning.    This is what usually happens in a religious debate; dead horses are beaten to a bloody pulp and everyone leaves a little pissed off.    Now you may ask yourself, why am I posting in R&S if I think this? well the truth is i'm killing time and have nothing better to do :(|`|2rCZbaEIaa	sometimes it makes me think outside the box a bit....but more often than not it make me more sure of my beliefs    especially when people get "dirty" about their beliefs and start putting people down, claiming their own superiority in an angry gesture....it makes me thank God that Im sure enough in my beliefs that I don't have to shove it at people and insult them in hopes that they embrace it.|`|nTqke90Uaa	It makes me think of whay do I belive, and in most cases it confirmes it.

But intellectual conversation never hurts, but rather should encourage you to know more about your religion - and often helps me grow in my faith.     FWIW, I totally agree with the first poster - as much as atheists don't want to admit it, atheism IS a religion. As per the dictionary:    a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.  2.a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects  6.something one believes in and follows devotedly; a point or matter of ethics or conscience:    Some definitions are more appropriate than others, but as far as I can tell, these seem to fit the definition of what an atheist believes, rather than emphasizing what they 'don't believe.    ETA: Fish, don't give up. Think of the mustard seed ... how that seed can grow even when planted in some of the harshest conditions. You never know. ;)|`|uUCTem2Eaa	It does both for me.

But when we respond to our accusers as the Savior did, we not only become more Christlike, we invite others to feel His love and follow Him as well.    The Savior responded differently in every situation. When He was confronted by wicked King Herod, He remained silent. When He stood before Pilate, He bore a simple and powerful testimony of His divinity and purpose. Facing the moneychangers who were defiling the temple, He exercised His divine responsibility to preserve and protect that which was sacred. Lifted up upon a cross, He uttered the incomparable Christian response: Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do (Luke 23:34).    Some people mistakenly think responses such as silence, meekness, forgiveness, and bearing humble testimony are passive or weak. But, to love [our] enemies, bless them that curse [us], do good to them that hate [us], and pray for them which despitefully use [us], and persecute [us] (Matthew 5:44) takes faith, strength, and, most of all, Christian courage.    When we do not retaliatewhen we turn the other cheek and resist feelings of angerwe too stand with the Savior. We show forth His love, which is the only power that can subdue the adversary and answer our accusers without accusing them in return. That is not weakness. That is Christian courage.    Through the years we learn that challenges to our faith are not new, and they arent likely to disappear soon. But true disciples of Christ see opportunity in the midst of opposition|`|OAqTt0nsaa	I am more convinced everyday that Atheism is a Religion.

It's actually quite fascinating. I've been a Christian basically my whole life, so that's all I know first hand. And I don't personally know any Atheists or Muslims or anything else. So I've never been able to grasp people not believing in God or that Jesus is the Son of God....but I'm beginning to see how other people believe and understand and reason. And that's a good thing; more people should try to understand where others are coming from. It helps you have a respect (probably not the right word) for other people, even if they don't believe the same as you.    I've never been swayed in my beliefs by anything on here, though. I follow Christ with a happy heart and nothing on here can change that, but I do enjoy the rapport. :)|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Both!

But if you're saying that all day long the mall security only stops Native Americans, then yes, that is racist.

AA10488602	I think because they are having difficulty identifying the source of the problem. They haven't pinpointed why guys are having more trouble yet.    Also because guys are still earning more in the workforce. There is a persistent wage gap favoring men.    Politicians are seeing that boys are having trouble in school while women are still struggling to get equal pay in the workforce. It makes those politicians question whether boys being behind in school is really a problem later on in the workforce.

Or if it's going to be BIG- make it a 'stoplight party' which is where people who are in relationships wear red. People who don't wanna be hit on or are in a complicated relationship wear yellow. And all you single ladies and single guys who wanna get hit on (or even hook up) wear green! :]    Have fun! ?

Yw1k1W19aa	A tarot pack will usually have 78 cards. It consists of a regular pack of Latin suited playing cards (with cups, coins, swords, and batons) and a fifth suit of picture cards that function as trumps (numbered 1-21 with an unnumbered card called The Fool). They were created for playing card games and the four regular suits fuction in the same way as those in Poker/Bridge cards - the extra suit is, as I've said, a suit of fixed trumps.<br>  <br>  You can learn more about how to use them in game play:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tarocchino.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarocchino.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pagat.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pagat.com</a><br>  <br>  On the other hand, many English speakers like to try and tell the future from them, just as they have done with tea leaves, dominoes, knuckle bones, etc, etc. If you want to try this look at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeclectic.net</a><br>  <br>  And if you find that you can tell the future, Google James Randi - because he has a cheque for one million dollars for anyone who can do just that. Oddly, no one has claimed it yet.|`|4TX26viFaa	It sounds like you got one of the Marseille decks, which don't have illustrated minors.  They're harder to read, you have to memorize the meanings.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	If you do not have nay idea what to do with the cards why did you buy them?<br>  <br>  Otherwise you play with the set and get used to it.  Many now have pictures on all cards which makes it more interesting and also gives you ideas when reading them as something should take your attention.  If not, see if you can get a book which gives you the meaning that the originator of the set thinks should be applied to each card, upright or reversed, and should give you sample spreads (how to lay out the cards) and sample readings.  <br>  <br>  Some do read cards according to the book, but this is just a guideline as to what type of meaning this card or suit has.  Cards are best used to point you in a direction and  to distract your attention till the meaning just pops into your mind.|`|ddae81176a45fb68a40708536cdf1038aa	Well, the Major Arcana will have Roman Numerals on them, and the rest should be arranged in 4 suits (cups, wands, swords, pentacles) and numbered Ace thru ten plus Page, Knight, Queen, and King. Regardless of their numbering, you treat them all the same - - - you concentrate on your question while shuffling, lay out some of the cards on the top of the shuffled deck in a particular pattern, and 'read' them as the answer to your question. <br>  <br>  If you are into numerology, you might take notice of the card numbers in the reading.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	What do you mean that just have numbers on them?<br>  <br>  You'll have a major arcana, each of which has a number on the card as well, and Ace - King of 4 different suits.<br>  <br>  All your cards should have numbers as well as pictures which contain symbolism on them.<br>  <br>  Which deck did you buy?  There are literally tons of different tarot decks to choose from.  Or is it some sort of oracle deck you bought, not actually tarot?  (Because a standard tarot deck should have 78 cards.)<br>  <br>  Your question is confusing, you need to provide a little more info here.|`|JMOLRKRraa	the numbers determine where you are on a particular journey or process.<br>  Metaphysics. the location and expulsion of the energy<br>  Since you seem to have no interest in metaphysics, why buy cards?<br>  They are to provide insight into your soul's journey, more than minor divination.|`|vhlORK4Waa	tricky unless you are an experienced reader - why did you buy them, the ones with pictures on the numbered cards are easier to learn...can you take them back?<br>  <br>  It take it you mean the minor arcana? These numbered cards are just like the ace-10 cards in a deck of playing cards, they have the same meanings as the numbered cards with pictures on in the four suits, they are just more difficult for beginners or inexperienced people to use. The pictures help to jog insight, and to tell a story about the reading and the card itself.  <br>  <br>  Try this website for a look at a lot of different card types<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeclectic.net</a><br>  <br>  The first set I ever bought were the Classic Rider Waite cards, now I tend to use Liber T - the Stars Eternal, basically copied from Crowley's Thoth tarot, but the artwork is nicer. The Greenwood Tarot and the Witches Tarot (not the tarot of the witches) are popular too.  Find one with pictures on, there are some reproduction renaissance ones from Italy that have numbered cards, is it one of these that you got? <br>  The Major Arcana are the Tarot cards with the most symbolic and divinatory importance. There are 22 Major Arcana, numbered from 0 to 21, each of which is individually named and illustrated.<br>  <br>  The major Arcana are also known as the "trumps" (from "triumphs") of the Tarot deck. Some call them Atu - hence "Atu XVIII" refers to The Moon.<br>  <br>  People often ask what the cards "mean". That's an impossible question. Each individual Tarot deck has its own imagery and symbolism which must then be filtered through the psyche of the reader and the context of the question. Understanding the meaning of Tarot cards is ultimately a very personal thing. That's why it's important to try several different decks before settling on one - even then you'll probably find that different decks are best suited to different questions or just different moods.<br>  <br>  While the major arcana expresses universal themes, the minor arcana brings those themes down into the practical arena to show how they operate in daily events. The minor arcana cards represent the concerns, activities and emotions that make up the dramas of our everyday lives. <br>  <br>  There are 56 cards in the minor arcana divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles. [Note] Each of these suits stands for a particular approach to life. <br>  <br>  Wands<br>  The Wands are the suit of creativity, action and movement. They are associated with such qualities as enthusiasm, adventure, risk-taking and confidence. This suit corresponds to the yang, or masculine principle, in Chinese philosophy and is associated with the element Fire. A flickering flame is the perfect symbol of the Wands force. This energy flows outward and generates passionate involvement. <br>  <br>  Cups<br>  The Cups are the suit of emotions and spiritual experience. They describe inner states, feelings and relationship patterns. The energy of this suit flows inward. Cups correspond to the yin, or feminine principle, in Chinese philosophy and are associated with the element Water. The ability of water to flow and fill up spaces, to sustain and to reflect changing moods makes it the ideal symbol of the Cups suit. <br>  <br>  Swords<br>  The Swords are the suit of intellect, thought and reason. They are concerned with justice, truth and ethical principles. Swords are associated with the element Air. A cloudless sky, open and light-filled, is a symbol of the mental clarity that is the Swords ideal. This suit is also associated with states that lead to disharmony and unhappiness. Our intellect is a valuable asset, but as an agent of ego, it can lead us astray if it is not infused with the wisdom of our Inner Guide. <br>  <br>  Pentacles<br>  The Pentacles are the suit of practicality, security and material concerns. They are associated with the element Earth and the concrete requirements of working with matter. In Pentacles, we celebrate the beauty of nature, our interactions with plants and animals and our physical experiences in the body. Pentacles also represent prosperity and wealth of all kinds. Sometimes this suit is called the Coins, an obvious symbol of the exchange of goods and services in the physical world. <br>  <br>  Each minor arcana suit has a distinct quality all its own. Our everyday experiences are a blend of these four approaches. Your tarot readings will show you how the different suit energies are impacting your life at any given moment. <br>  <br>  <br>  Halcon<br>  <br>  Crystal clear - there ARE decks without pictures, the original decks didn't have pictures, and playing cards are said to be derived from tarot decks, without the major arcana except for the joker (The Fool)....piccies on the suit cards are a relatively new innovation in the scheme of things!|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	all tarot cards are named by numbers. don't throw them out. the major arcana are numbered. what deck are you using?|`|na8ObA5Haa	The deck should come with instructions, <br>  all are different so i wouldnt know unless i knew what type you had

Bb6fQtl0aa	The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|QIgrBrFdaa	Hmm, would be nice.<br>  <br>  Inshallah we learn to accept and support our Muslim brothers and sisters rather than picking out our differences and insulting them.<br>  <br>  @ Eviwahhabi - Leave Allah to judge who the Muslims are. You are a mere human still learning about this life, the right path just as much as we are. You have no idea which is the true path, so avoid the sins and stop trying to insult others as though you know - for your own sake bro.|`|lvWqfnfpaa	You're right.<br>  <br>  [6:159] Those who divide themselves into sects do not belong with<br>  you. Their judgment rests with GOD, then He will inform<br>  them of everything they had done. <br>  <br>  But when I want to show people that I dont follow any Imams or a 'prophet' or pray in some mystical way, I have no choice but to say Im Sunni. Sunnis follow Quran and Sunnah. After Prophet Muhammad came, Islam was complete, we dont need anyone else to lead us|`|6L4n6CFaaa	Yeah i just say Muslims now anyway.<br>  but will continue it.|`|YU5ke1fOaa	Wazzup twin<br>  <br>  yes i agree with using the term muslim.|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  to be honest, i look at myself as a muslim before anything else.......<br>  .........and then i look at myself as a person who believes Imam Ali (As) was chosen and etc etc, and follows the Shia teachings<br>  <br>  @Eviwahhabi<br>  <br>  sunnis are muslims bro..........<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|UibsALccaa	Yh, I class myself just a Muslim. But yh, sunni and shi'a need to settle the difference. We all muslims after all right?

Homosexuals hiding behind the Catholic Church as priests are responsible for that. The Catholic Church has no more or less % of homosexuals molesting adolescence than any other mainstream organization. Are you a victim of this indecency?|`|Z049OX67aa	I never got where this rumor came from, i mean how many kids go to church by themselves? And if its in Catholic schools then its schools not church. I get why Catholic priests are easy targets i mean they have very faithful lives and most people today are promiscuous to say it nicely without remorse unlike catholics and especially the priests. Its like in World War 2 The Germans picked on the Jews simply so they could have someone and say "Ay those are the people that are the cause of your problems" The same thing now. I mean you look at Michael Jackson, obviously raised strangely and strange looking and im not saying whether he did or did not do it but hes a easy target.

Ann Coulter is an uninformed belligerent who makes money by catering to the lowest common denominator. That quote she made was absolutely ridiculous; the media are the ones who refer to Obama and Halle Berry as black. Know why? Because it's obvious they're at least partially black. I've already heard Obama tell tons of stories about the white side of his family.<br>  <br>  "But instead of seeing themselves as half-white, they prefer to see the glass as half-black." What does that quote say about her, when she uses an analogy about optimism and pessimism and puts race into it?

6E3BlN9Gaa	I used to be like that. Now I am not that way. I didn't have any close friends, so everything I felt was just bottled up inside. Try to meet people. The ones who care are the ones who will yell at you and be harsh so you will change. Make a close friend, if you haven't already. Be honest. I also started going to school (college)for something I really really love. It helps me to get out of my own head. I also started working out. If you are in high school or aren't interested in going school, try to learn about something that is your passion. <br>  You don't always have to feel the way you do. Many people are the same as you.

i6Mi8uWIaa	It depends upon the "rights." There are alienable and inalienable. Inalienable rights come from God. Alienable rights come from the people.<br>  <br>  Inalienable rights, those rights which God has endowed us with, include the rights to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness (that's the PURSUIT of happiness, not happiness itself), dignity, justice, and the everyday needs that every person requires for survival, including shelter, clothing, and nutritious food.<br>  <br>  Alienable rights, those rights created by man, include the "right" to live as you wish, the "right" to murder your unborn child, the "right" to marry someone of the same sex, the "right" to euthanize those who are elderly/sick/weak, the "right" to drive, the "right" to own a home/property, etc. <br>  <br>  Whether or not liberty is an alienable or inalienable right is debatable, to be honest. While we are all born with a right to freedom and liberty, to not be enslaved, I do believe that this same right can be taken away if you commit a crime and deserve incarceration.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	They arise from the social contract and are mutable.<br>  <br>  We regularly modify the rights of others.  In many states in the USA, for example, felons lose the right to vote.  Criminals lose their rights to self-determination when we lock them in jail or prison.<br>  <br>  If these rights are endowed by a creator, that creator has a moral obligation to enforce them -- yet there is no enforcement other than that allowed under a social contract.<br>  <br>  To assert that rights arise from a creator is to assert an impotent creator.|`|jR8mclWIaa	The constitution guarantees the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<br>  God don't guarantee the right to life.  He killed lots of people before their time<br>  God don't guarantee the right to liberty.  Slavery is endorsed in both the old and new testament'.<br>  And He purposely made Job's life miserable.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	Our rights come from our Creator.  Otherwise, "rights" would be a matter of personal/popular opinion, which that can quickly become dangerous.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|PcNzgisHaa	haha you said..'little thing'...|`|v7G1dmgXaa	Our creator says we don't even have the "RIGHT" to guide our own feet.|`|wukXoRCMaa	we obtain our morals from philosophy|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Current decisions of the people, which should be apparent if you think about what the authors of the US Constitution were making sure wouldn't happen -- theocracy.<br>  <br>  Look around the world governments where there is some religious aspect to them, such as the king/queen of England also automatically being the head of the church, and rulers who are or had been believed to be divine, such as was the case in Japan.<br>  <br>  In the US, the first (and I think the only) to include separation of church and state as a fundamental tenet, placed primacy on individual liberty and government ruled by the people.<br>  <br>  The conflict between people over such hot topics as abortion, euthanasia, same-sex marriage, etc. is over individual freedom vs. social conscience. The same was true of slavery, where people saw those owned as property as deserving of the same individual rights as everyone else.<br>  <br>  It is up to the people to defend the Constitution, and amend the law to support both liberty and justice. Not always easy, of course, but the government cannot arbitrarily rewrite the Constitution, but can create laws under certain circumstances, which can be challenged in court. The legal branch is a powerful check and balance for government.|`|6qBG1xrsaa	Not from the current decisions but more from people in the past - yonks ago, laying down basic morals, and the current population or people in more recent times elaborating on them. Rules can change but morals stay the same - not from our creator, but developed in our minds when our brains grew to reason and empathize. For this reason, things like euthanasia of the useless will never be acceptable, if anything rights like that will become more despicable as our ability to empathize and moralise grows with evolution.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Current decisions of the people.

Question answered!|`|ORmrJXRxaa	There are two kinds of rights, those coming from God and those from our society. The latter depending where we live. In fact what is right in one place can be no right at all at another place. But those endowed by our Creator are right to live,to have liberty, for food, education and also to be loved. <br>  Some of these are recognized by our society or governments but others are not, unfortunately. Then society put some rights as we find in the various laws, which all means our right in society. <br>   However, I do not agree that it is a right to abortm even though it is accepted by society. By this you would be taking away the liberty of the unborn. God gave life and only He have the right to take it away. It is no right to euthanize. God has His plans and we have no right even though we think it is good that we cut short other's life. We decide for him. It is not good and we have no right to it. <br>  If the rights that people gives us do not  follow the principles of God then they are no rights at all.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Our rights have always issued from the people that govern and/or control us, including the church (especially in older times).

Criminals (once proven guilty) wave their rights and privileges at the time they commit the crime; and therefore, criminals should not have right to decide how we spend tax dollars or demand certain foods or none of that stuff.  You want to demand your life style then you do not commit crime and you work to support whatever life style you wish to live.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Rights either come from the Creator or they are a verbal fiction.

Also the fact that the symbol of the cross was used in pagan worship for centuries before Christ died for us. <br>  Its just another one of those "traditions" that people cling to without knowing that they are actually angering the only true God.<br>  Matthew 15:6-9<br>  John 17:3|`|AAGW4kAhaa	This is actually a good question.  I too, have wondered if Jesus is pleased with people wearing a cross in honor of him.  <br>  <br>  I know if my loved one were killed by a drunk driver, I wouldn't start wearing a small beer can around my neck to honor them. <br>  <br>  But in the end, I admit that it's what's in the person's heart that matters.

Loads of people were crucified in those days.  The cross did not become a holy symbol until Jesus was crucified on one.  The cross beams were just a means of stretching out one's limbs and torturing them until death.  Good news though: Jesus is still alive today!<br>  <><|`|tBlLxH5Kaa	Many Christians actually were hanged...sorry to give such a serious answer...<br>  <br>  <br>  You'd be depressed if you actually thought about reality and that death is inevitable.|`|vfhbs3qPaa	Wow, why do people ask questions on here that they obviously don't care about the answer to, first of all I think you know the answer, and second of all why bother posting this question.|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	No.  They'd wear noose pendants however.

Is gazillion a word ? because if gazillion is a word I should use it when referring to how many times this silly, childish, idiotic question has been ask....so, I guess I will change from zillion to gazillion then..... but to answer in all seriousness : I would wear a riding mower around my neck if that was the means of His dying, or maybe even a weed whacker... Or, ohhhhh, let me think here, maybe a bar-b-que pit .. or a chain saw, yup, I would wear a chain saw around my neck I think..... maybe, just maybe a drill ??

yO0HFCxvaa	I would say Spanish, I can't find a good job in LA without them wanting me to speak Spanish.|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Spanish is most useful, Italian is the prettiest and most flowing.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	If you live in Arizona, you'll have the most opportunity to practice Spanish - the only way to get really fluent.  This would open up most of Latin America for you.  From there, it's relatively simple to learn Italian and Portuguese due to the similarities (a university here has one class called Italian for Spanish speakers, after which you are qualified to take Italian literature, instead of the normal 3 courses of Italian)|`|1d3be905c594dfa5842eec70072bbee6aa	If i was still in high school i would choose italian, because italian is similar to Spanish<br>  <br>  And, i already know Spanish, but for you i would suggest that you take spanish first then Italian,<br>  <br>  Spanish of course, is more helpful in american society, and that went into my decision to take spanish in high school|`|blxlNHeCaa	Spanish would probably be the easiest to learn, and since you live in the southwest would come in the most handy. After you learn Spanish you can learn Italian, because they are very similar :)|`|NFyQWFoGaa	French. The language is so beautiful, and France is so nice. The language is pretty easy.|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	Spanish comes more in handy, as it spoken more in America.  However, German is the most fun.|`|DJfAVCwuaa	German and French are two languages of international business, but living in Arizona, Spanish would be very useful... Take whatever language you want.  They will all be useful if you pursue them, but you will lose your knowledge of the language if you don't practice.  So, find a language you want to pursue, and practice it for the rest of your life if you want to use it in a practical situation!<br>  <br>  BTW Portuguese is also spoken in nearby Brazil, Spanish is spoken in the rest of Latin America except some of the islands and Belize, and French is spoken in nearby Quèbec, a province of Canada which has the major business centre of Montrèal in it.  In Europe it is self explanatory, but almost every one  there speaks several languages, usually including at least one of English, french, or German.<br>  <br>  I personally am now learning German but would love to one day be fluent in several languages.|`|cAHyEAI7aa	French is beautiful and so is Italian but where else will you use them besides France and Italy? I would reccomend taking spanish. <br>  <br>  Take spanish because we are getting more and more people from spanish speaking countries coming over to america. Wouldn't you like to talk to them? Take spanish because it is similar to english, so it is not that big of a leap with pronounciation and learning things. It get's tricky, but after a while you'll get the hang of it. If you really like spanish and get good at it, then you should consider taking Italian due to the same romance language influence. You said you wanted to work somewhere internationally, then take spanish because there is an entire continent right below us that could use your help!|`|TkCoWru9aa	Since you live in the states, then probably spanish because it's most common and would be more useful to you. If you plan to move somewhere like another country when you're older, or you plan on going on vacation soon, you might want to learn that language so you could talk to the people. It would be fun to talk to the villagers in Germany, or speak to the people of france. Hope i helped!|`|w3plOs6uaa	spanish.

One about a flood, one about eruptions from volcanoes, winds blowing people away, and I can't remember the other one (sorry). But they thought the fifth one was the final one, and everything would be wiped out. But I don't think this will happen. They sacrificed many people to appease their "gods in the underworld"  and they got so desperate as to sacrifice innocent babies, because of a possible drought. (Thats what a few people believe happened to them) I think that they were just natural disasters, and they blamed their gods for these things to happen.

He was a fighter and a soldier. But he was also a gambling addict, and lost everything he had. When he converted, he humbled himself and learned to read in a classroom full of small children. He was an adult, but voluntarily studied with kids so he could educate himself. He eventually became a hospital organizer and a pioneer in battlefield medicine.

AND  St. Anthony, the Patron Saint of Lost Things.<br>  I personally asked St. Francsis to intercede and ask God to heal my sick Hamster when I was a child and have asked for St. Anthony's intercessory help to help me find things when I was a kid.  -- In case of my Hamster, he survived and lived a couple years past that. <br>  <br>  From the St. Stephen Wiki page:<br>  <br>  "Acts tells the story of how Stephen was tried by the Sanhedrin for blasphemy against Moses and God (Acts 6:11) and speaking against the Temple and the Law (Acts 6:13-14) (see also Antinomianism) and was then stoned to death (c. A.D. 34–35) by an infuriated mob encouraged by Saul of Tarsus, the future Saint Paul: "And Saul entirely approved of putting him to death" (8:1). [2]. Stephen's final speech is presented as making an accusation against the Jews of continuing to persecute prophets who spoke out against their sins"<br>  <br>  I chose him because as a High School Student.. I wanted to STAND UP for what I thought was right.  I wanted to have courage to follow my faith, even if it meant death. <br>  <br>  Since then, while I've struggled with my faith, myself,  I have always defended the Catholic faith and stood up for them. I have recently began to learn a bit about Apologetics - "which is defense of the faith using logic and reason" - The word apologetics comes from the greek word,  "apology" which unlike how we use it today, back then, actually meant the case which a lawyer would make to defend his client. The Lawyer's "apology" is where Catholicism gets its term "Apologetics"

If it's an issue of jealousy, than there are things you need to work out.  But if you may be thinking you don't want him to be friends with your friends b/c you two won't last then it may be time to move on. <br>  I think it's great for people to be friends with their bf/gf friends.  It's better than the other choice - not get a long.  I don't see any harm in it.  You need to dig deep about w hy you don't want him being friends with your friends.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Hard to say.

You dont really have the right to restrict or your partners or your friends contact with other people. That said, its natural to want a bit of a separation between your friendships and your relationship as you might not feel comfortable bring certain aspects of one into another.

nQvcqVkNaa	Matthew 2:7-16<br>  <br>  This is where we learn that the 3 people from the east followed a star to Herod who wanted to kill Jesus and that Herod calculated from the 3 easterners that Jesus would be about 2 years old at that time. So Herod had all the boys 2 years and younger killed because of the star that led the 3 from the east to him first.<br>  <br>  hmm... who could've sent that star?<br>  2 Corinthians 11:14|`|DZCFD0p2aa	when the wise men came...they instituted the practise of giving gifts on birthdays.

The fact that He started out just about as poor as anyone could get shows me that His love carries everyone! if he started out rich, poor people would probably feel inferior to him and his grace.

Also, i can't take my children not recognizing the 14 infallibles.  If a Shia guy marries a sunni girl, its still ok because the kids usually have a bigger influence of the dad's beliefs.

They will call the psychiatric services to help you. Why do you think the gym teacher is a vampire? Why do you think your friend is a vampire? Have you been taking strange drugs?  Having you been watching vampire based films? <br>  <br>  This answer will help you because if you're serious you do need help and you do need to talk to someone. If you are a troll, well I don't care, because vampires are not real. No, they are not. Black clothes, an bad/emo attitude,  a few zips and pale make up do not a vampire make.

If it was you that decided that they where both vampires ask your friend if they are a vampire, and confirm they are not messing with you, again if they say they are you should both see a doctor, if the teacher told you they where a vampire then they should see a doctor, and you should speak to the most important teacher you can find, and if they said that they where a vampire in a threatening way that could be counted a a death threat then you could probably get the teacher sent to jail, as death threats (i think) are illegal. And you should speak to your parents.<br>  <br>  Also once this problem is resolved please do post what you did and what happened because i would love to find out.|`|ANPv0ZcMaa	use garlic,,, wear it put it under your fingernails.. vampires cant stand it... that should detier her for a while. your friend the vampire should be able to fill you in on the teachers weakness and if all else fails, let the 2 vampires go at it.

z4Yeofq8aa	2- yes they should be taught- one in religious education class and the other in a science class.|`|AA11297267	What's a "detal?"<br>  <br>  1) which "church?"  Catholic, mormon, baptist, episcopal, muslim, scientology, jehovah's witness...?  <br>  <br>  2) no.  This goes back to my "which church" above.  Which one are you going to teach in school?  To be fair, if you teach one you have to teach them all -- and that wouldn't leave any time for reading, writing, math, art, etc.  So the only other fair way to do it -- and the one that the framers of our constitution chose -- is to teach NO "church" or religion in public school.  Religion is up to the invidivual.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	1) Yes, one runs on faith and the other runs on evidence. They are not mutally exclusive though, you can have both in your life.<br>  <br>  2) Yes, but don't mix them up. Of course we need to teach science, kids need to know how the world works. I think religions should be taught in a social studies classes, they have a big effect on culture and it is important to have a basic understanding of what the major religions beleive (though it is impossible to cover all of them). Stuff like intelligent design isn't science though, so it shouldn't be mentioned in science classes.|`|pYimIJAWaa	1) absolutely 2) science should be taught in science classes.

Science is based on things we can test and see and touch. The church is based on a faitytale book.<br>  <br>  2) Yes they should both be taught in school. We should let children choose what they want to believe in. From there we can see whose smart and who isnt.|`|FKN8Rmu6aa	This is a very stupid question. I guess you are Christian?<br>   Home schooled? Science is a vast and open subject for the enlightenment of mankind. Church(as you say) or Religion is a dim closed ended dogma of absurd myth, and Hokey, dubious morality. Many people would not teach that filth to children at all. Only to teach them that religious people are like any other mentally ill people. They should be treated with medicine,therapy and restraint. They should not be allowed to further harm society. Obviously if you can't restrain them or treat them medically, they must be put down like a rabid animal.|`|LCZChP7Maa	Because religious beliefs vary, I don't think science should be taught in school. Likewise, I don't think evolution should be taught in schools - especially since most religions teach creation. The people who created the evolution theory didn't respect the bible.|`|907eccf187a1d01eb469d6a0a106913eaa	the church of.. scientology? which religion should get the privilege to replace science or be taught alongside science?

You're human just like the rest of us. We all go down the wrong road from time to time.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	There is a time in everyone's life that they think they've grown up enough to say whatever they want to say.  Then they learn (hopefully) that what they say effects others and realize that freedom and responsibility go together.  It seems you've learned that lesson (at least partially).  The guilt will go away slowly, but the lesson never will.<br>  <br>  We all make mistakes, only the people who don't learn from them are hopeless.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	What makes a person "bad", is not always what he says or does, but most importantly, what is in his heart.

GtJYDEayaa	Because they enjoy inflicting fear and pain? There are people like that.
Wwkk87Igaa	In my school people of that religion are allowed the day off. But I agree, why should everyone get Christian days off? I think considering the USA/Britain Christian countries is an old-fashioned view. There are all types of cultures here. Not, of course, that I want to be at school for Christmas (Atheist - I wouldn't get any holidays... T-T) but I think we should be let off school for religious holidays of all faiths.|`|iwIKK2nEaa	Schools have off  because the majority of the country is Christian. In areas with a large Jewish population i.e. Cherry Hill, NJ schools have the Jewish holidays off. It just depends where you live.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	Christmas and Good Friday are federal holidays. The school public school system is governed by local, state and federal government regulations thereby making the public school system a government institution. School is also off for New Years Eve, New Years Day, Labor Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Presidents Day and Dr. MLK jr's Birthday. All of these are federal holidays. Also there is no summer school on Independence Day. Religion plays a big part of of why these holidays were chosen as federal holidays. The obvious fact is the founders of this country we also Christians. For some of the Christian faith has been incorporated into the Institution of this country. Countries where the majority of the people are of a different faith celebrate their own holidays.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	What do you mean? Christmas is a wholly Christian celebration. The reason that we get days off for christian holidays is because Britain is a christiian country, and also because the holidays are very conviniently spaced out|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	lol depends which country, if the country has a christian majority, why would they let people of for a muslim holiday?|`|Me8JEgzpaa	Christianity is one of the most dominant religions in America. Most school administrations are racist, sort of, in religion... religionist??|`|nXxtBkguaa	well, number one, Christmas is a Christian holiday, it's when we celebrate the birth of jesus    number two they do get off for most of hannukkah    number three, there are only two Christian holidays and about a million Jewish ones.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Christmas is also considered a secular holiday, a legal holiday where government workers are off that day.  The Jewish holidays and solely religious and occur at different times each year.  You can't compare.|`|hnhb119Laa	It's really just a practicle matter.  In areas with heavy Jewish or Muslim populations, they close for those holidays, too.  If school was open on Christmas, how many kids would show up?|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Actually . . . . depending on where you live . .. schools are closed on Jewish holidays.    I live in Miami, Florida . . . stores have Hannukkah cards and we have great respect for our Jewish neighbors.    Muslims ?       When they stop killing people all over the world . . . I'll care about them, too.    Dan in Miami|`|731e61cebec438f48fbf84f60ff2687aaa	We have holidays like Christmas and Easter off from work/school because even though they are Christian based, a lot of secular people celebrate them too as a way of being with family.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Because America was built on Christian values. They just havent made the choice to make such changes. If they did, we'd have to please EVERY religion and it would take too much time and energy.|`|jERevyR8aa	because most people are christians.  celebrate on your own time if you aren't.|`|3972dcebce6b2f1b72be1c48572bf2a5aa	well i live in Saudi arabia and we dont have holidays for christians and jews do we? ^_^|`|AA12018110	I guess it depends on what religion is most dominant. You can't really go to an Islamic country and demand that you get an Easter holiday just because you're Christian, I suppose it's the same in the states but I'm guessing that depends on the most dominant religion at a particular school.|`|JOuaXkP8aa	I get off for Hanukkah. You know, winter break. And Yom Kippur and Rosh (I'm about to butcher the spelling) Hashanah. I think there are too many holidays for us to get off for all of them. So they just picked a major one (Christmas) and let us off for it. (Though there are exceptions, like how I don't have school during Yom Kippur)|`|dZ0UhBfeaa	Good question, I would love that.     I guess it's because of the foundation of which the country is found. I mean, if you go to a Muslim country, most would not get a day off for any non-Muslim holiday. So the same rule applies to Western society.    It would be cool though.|`|a9084cd799d4e9e97ce3f563f3715d19aa	depends which country you live and dominant belief of that country, you just got to adapt to the mainstream. and if need the time off, just bunk off, i had to all my life, as i am the minority.|`|VHka0aHFaa	they do let kids go on those Holiday's it just depends on the student population like if you have 60% Arabic / w.e in a school they give that holiday Eid off..   Like b.4 in my city they never even gave martin luther kings day off until more african americans came.  it all depends|`|SikKKiSXaa	The gigantically vast majority of Americans are Christian.   For example...  At my high school, there is a Muslim student association and a Christian student organization. The Muslim student organization has only twelve members, and only about eight regularly come to meetings. By contrast, the Christian student organization meetings fill up more than half of the school cafeteria, sometimes more.|`|6rOMqxPHaa	Yeah we should take off Muslim and Christain holidays off, not jewish though
sE94HgDBaa	Small things can add up to big things.  You can't let every little thing get to you but you also should not ignore all the little things.  One should always use their mind and think what needs attention and what can be forgotten.

That is one of the things I need to improve about myself. =)|`|6L4n6CFaaa	Yes, they do.<br>  a lot of small things can add up,too.|`|SzqeeUxgaa	yes.... because I have a heart~!|`|zBqt99avaa	No.  People are usually upset at other things in their life, or at themselves.  They don't stop to consider others.  If they do something intentional, it says more about themselves than it does about you.
Kl56NSmLaa	Because it's not true. People who think it is are making the classic mistake of 'confirmation bias'.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	The Secret was a top-seller; you're flat wrong saying people don't believe in the Law of Attraction|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Because its total bollocks. Basically. Seriously, how egotistical does one have to be to think that the universe cares, in its infinite majesty, about we puny creatures? Not least, does us favours if we ask nicely?    Give me some mechanism by which it works and I'll think about it. It would be nice, too, if you say something like "The brain gives out these waves", if you provided some source on that.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	do you mean romantic??? sure we all do....be specific...|`|N3BXYCYUaa	Prolly for the same reason you're sitting alone at your computer|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	I have enough refrigerator magnets to be high priest|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Some people aren't intelligent enough to comprehend what it truly means.. and as a result of that, we don't believe..|`|nJatWOhsaa	Probably because when people write books on it or talk about it they generally sound moronic.    I think that "law" makes sense... but only because when you concentrate on what you want, you subconsciously (and consciously) find ways to get it.|`|CQo3Y0Jmaa	What do you mean exactly?    I believe in the law of attraction and also soul mates.|`|q8vILEpfaa	Who says we don't ? and who calls it new age?      You got to quit that smokin|`|JjRo67Moaa	I can't say I don't  neither I can say that I do    but I'll try it out someday    at least it's not something like Islam or hell and satan|`|bticQDIhaa	Because it flies in the face of reality.|`|6aIuZZi7aa	Actually, the Law of Attraction is new age. I have read a couple of books on the Law of Attraction, but I have not seen the movie The Secret. I don't put emphasis on the Law of Attraction than any other new age belief and practice. But if you believe in it and it works for you, that's great.|`|AA11668191	Achieving your goals has everything to do with the effort you put into achieving them; that's not a Secret, it's common sense. The Secret takes the idea way too far. By pretending the "Law of Attraction" is a universal truth, you ALWAYS get what you deserve whether good or bad, much like the concepts of karma and divine justice. It's simply idiotic. Are victims of war or natural disasters subconsciously self-destructive? It's ridiculous, but the "Law" would have you believe they are (though when confronted, supporters get evasive). People call the it new age because it is bad logic masquerading as life-affirming spirituality. Of course, there's nothing new about it. Both Christ and Buddha (among others) did their best to get rid of it, but it keeps popping up to fool new generations of well-meaning people.|`|Lc8hkjHPaa	If you mean the law of attraction from the book, "The Secret", then the answer's simple. The idea that our brains are sending out waves of energy based on our feelings and thought, and the universe - upon receiving these waves - magically gives us what we want, is a little crazy. The force of chaos is very complicated and yet very simple. When things happen to us that are chaotic and mysterious, we sometimes try to associate these things with some divine force. It's almost the same brain function as the one which imprints older memories with the feeling commonly called deja vu. Unfortunately, we have to live with the fact that everyone has similar, mundane coincidences.|`|vnSskmVRaa	I think it may be because most people can easily remember one or more times in their life when they really really wanted something and they thought good things about it - and then didn't get it.  Or, they remembered loads of things that they received that they most definitely did NOT want.  And therefore of course they thought the law of attraction was a load of rubbish.  Well, asking for what you want and thinking positive things about it is just one part of the equation.  Without knowing and implementing the whole equation (the believe and receive part), you continue to not get what you want and also probably get things you don't want.

V2jhfnGVaa	Because most African Americans are not always full African. Like other cultures we are mixed with other things. Besides people who are "black", as u say, like Rihanna she is from the Caribbean, however people still consider her "black" even though she's not from Africa. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, being African means you are REALLY from Africa. As though you still had family there and that is what you identified your home as. African Americans identify their home as America. <br>  <br>  "Black" people come from all over.

ZOFM0g9haa	He didn't have any child with Aisha.    Prophet Muhammad had five children from his first wife Khadijah. One son, Al qasim died when he was still a baby. His four daughters: Zaynab, Ruqayah, Fatimah, and Om Kolthoom.    The last child, a boy Abrahim was born 628 A.D. He was the only child born to the Prophet after Prophet Muhammad (may Peace Be Upon Him) knew that he was to be a Messenger of God. His mother was Maria, an Egyptian whom the king of Egypt sent to Prophet Muhammad (may Peace Be Upon Him) as a handmaid servant and Prophet Muhammad married her in 627.|`|mOWyzwubaa	Ayesha was never 6-9 yrs old when she married Prophet, this horrible ,horrendous belief is sunni belief

So, all those people (maybe even you) who were wondering where their mail was.....? Yeah.
na8ObA5Haa	Every once in awhile you should act like your young teenagers again, Go out clubbing, get waisted, try new things, have fun together, Then get home and enjoy some steamy passionate love making ;)     Life is too short to feel unhappy, or bored you need to get out there in this big world and do things you never thought you would do, you may be married and probably olde but that doesnt mean you guys cant act like teenagers again. Join clubs, find hobbies, meet fun friends and go out together!

Do you have any? It does not sound like it because I would not downgrade my life to what you describe. That's surviving and it's not a life.     I'm teaching myself to play the piano. I love to read. I love music. I love working out. I love fashion.     What interests you? What inspires you? That is what makes life beautiful and interesting. It requires work and effort.    My husband's ex is the type of person that doesn't have any hobbies and thinks life is supposed to be a fairy tale with no effort from her. That type of person drives me crazy. But really she does because she is not a good mother to her kids. She's too selfish and stupid.    The passion comes from within you. You have to find it. It takes work. I've always been interested in a great many things and consequently, I have a great life. I'm very happy.
ncdTxID9aa	The Malagasy, who are of mixed Malayo-Polynesian, African, and Arab heritage, include 18 distinct groups differing in regional and ancestral affiliation. Although there are some linguistic differences, nearly all speak a dialect of the Malagasy language. None of these groups constitutes a majority of the population.

iqZUd5Fdaa	Im sure a few intelligent individuals would have fun with it and get along fine, but the majority of the world is full of idiots that dont know their limits. If you want proof, take a look at the people that are so fat they cant get out of their house without being lifted out by the fire brigade, just because they like eating. The thousands of people getting their stomachs pumped every saturday night from alcohol poisoning. The millions of people dying of smoking related lung cancer. Legalisation doesnt stop people from doing it, so why make it more widely available for people to wreak their life with. It could be regulated, not that it would make a lot of difference, it would still be sold illegally underground, and people wont abide by the age restirctions, just like they dont with drink and smokes|`|HvIS1Mk1aa	I'm all for it.    We have a legalised drug in the form of booze, and another in the form of tobacco; I fail to see how or why other substances can be outlawed.    I would be particularly pleased to see weed lagalised.    And no, I don't do drugs. Not even weed - I just like the smell of that stuff.    Drugs aren't a problem, what people do to get drugs is the problem. By legalising the chemicals we stand a chance of reducing the threats drug use presents to the non drug-taking society.|`|NVUngN45aa	theres no such thing|`|XeaC5UZhaa	I guess that would depend on what sort of drugs you were talking about.

As for harder drugs, I lean toward decriminalization with more emphasis on drug rehab as oppossed to locking people up.

People are always going to do it anyway and making it illegal only drives these things underground to the hands of the gangsters who run their business with guns and people trafficking.  I don't think one single person would suddenly go - oh drugs are legal now, lets all go and get high on heroin.  It does not condone or promote drugs, only controls them.    For example when prohibition came into effect in the USA, it did not stop people drinking, it merely meant that the gangsters / mafia set up speakeasy bars and illegal stills which made some people blind from drinking it.
wwNkO28Xaa	Being seventeen, I am in no position to begin any relationship. Yet, I am courting the girl I will one day marry even though I haven't met her yet..I think. I do so by keeping my thoughts and body pure and preserved for her and her alone. I will not date, kiss, or show intimate, bodily affection to any girl other than my wife, when she's my wife. I delve into scripture and study so to be of better judgment to lead the house I will one day protect and provide for. I strengthen my prayer life, character, and skills, and attempt to find success in whatever I put my hands to do. I strive to grasp, understand, and know the greatest of all commandments, "Thou shall love the lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul, and with all your strength."<br>  <br>  All for my wife. Because I love her. That is courtship, and I trust God to bring her to me when I am ready for her. Until then, I'll wait.|`|lJUyhMceaa	Many of you would be surprised to know that many families have gone back to the "courting" idea as opposed to dating.  <br>  <br>  When growing up, I was free to date from a young age.  As a result, I ended up a daddy at the age of 17.  When my kids were growing up, I decided that things would be different for my kids.<br>  <br>  I decided that my kids would not date, but would go through a "version" of the old courtship process.<br>  <br>  I am happy to say, both my son, and my daughter are married now and have started their own family.  They have both thanked me for taking a stand and not letting them get involved in the "dating scene".  Many of their friends had their lives almost ruined because their parents let them run around and date.<br>  <br>  Both my son and my daughter plan to do the same thing with their kids, which number five right now.<br>  <br>  My advice as a Christian counselor to parents is to "be parents".  Take charge of your kids life.  They do not have the mental aptitude to make good sound decisions.  That is what you as a parent is suppose to do.  Yes, courting is an old concept and is called "outdated" by many today.  But,  I would rather be called "outdated" then to let my kids ruin their lives just because "it's the thing to do".|`|pqveENjUaa	I do both. Start with courting and move to dating. The no touching thing is kinda crap though. I personally don't believe in nor follow a no-touching policy. I do believe a hug is perfectly appropriate, as is a kiss under certain circumstances.|`|O9omaIDAaa	Yes, essentially, but then it was the 1930s.<br>  <br>  I did date a catholic girl, a couple of times.<br>  <br>  It didn't last.  <br>  <br>  She couldn't wait to get me into her knickers, and hence, up the isle.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	What the hell?|`|5eSJpYbMaa	No touching thing? Psshh...That is like so 1800s<br>  <br>  I was down in the 3rd base by the time I was 15.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	No. It isn't 1865.|`|TzY9vkinaa	We hung out, and what exactly do you mean by no touching?<br>  we didn't touch private parts, but there sure was a lot of passionate kissing...|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Courting how? As in looking for a mate instead of dating for the fun of it? When I date, I date to find someone to spend my life with. I've only had one boyfriend. It didn't quite work out. The only touching we did was hugging each other and he held me when we watched a movie. It didn't get any farther than that.|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	Actually, we met every weekend in Oregon, because I lived in Washington and he lived in Idaho. We had sex on our second "meeting." I guess that's not courting. We were both in our 40s, though, so not exactly kids doing this for the first time.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Uh, no. This is 2009. Supposedly, people are getting less shameful over expressions of love. "Courting" is a nice word for choosing your life partner the same way you choose which cattle to buy.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Dating and courting are the same thing. And my husband was totally respectable the entire time and remained a total gentleman. He still is the most wonderful thoughtful man I know.
QqxZzvbAaa	heavenbound was right,saying any amount of "hail Marys" will get you no where.<br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|D9lMg7A2aa	It doesn't. As St Teresa of Avila said, following the Desert Fathers, better one prayer said with compunction than a hundred otherwise. <br>  <br>  Her teaching is in 'The Way of Perfection'.<br>  <br>  War by the way is most often called 'punishment for sin' so there is a connection there too.|`|AA11008046	Saying a continuous string of hail Mary's is in violation of Scripture.  Jesus taught to "..avoid vain repetitions.."  and praying to Mary does nothing to prevent wars.  You pray to God the Father and the Bible says through Jesus Christ our Lord.  1Jn 2:1,2  "..if any one sins they have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous and He himself (none other) is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the whole world..."|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Those are not prayers but vain repetitions that mean nothing to God.<br>  <br>   Matthew 6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	I also think the 'ones' who are into the 'hail mary' stuff need "Saving Knowledge" as well!!  I don't think 'they' can help you either!|`|93galWG1aa	1 hail Mary could be enough to save the world from war.|`|xKthWOGtaa	Prayer = you ask the heavens for something, and they either give you it or they don't.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to prevent wars, saying a hail mary is probably not going to achieve much, because that prayer is not dedicated to preventing wars. Pray for what you want. Not to say a hail mary is useless, but it serves a specific purpose. It isn't a one-size fits all remedy for everything, it is asking Mary to pray for you.<br>  <br>  Is all prayer successful? No. For a number of reasons. But primarily because the Heavens are not at the disposal of individual human beings. If they were, there would be chaos. Imagine how people would use prayer for selfish and destructive reasons. So maybe one has to reach a higher spiritual plane to have their prayers answered consistently - that is achieved through good behaviour and thoughts and other ascetic acts such as fasting, dedication and worship. Someone told me that anyway.|`|pqveENjUaa	Prayer is simply a plea to a higher order for some type of salvation or favor. People who believe in prayer, just as superstition, look for proof of the prayers being answered and when it is found, even if it isn't out of the ordinary or if it was guaranteed to happen in the first place, they consider it the answer of the god/s to whom they were praying.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	The "hail Mary full of grace..." words are catholic, and possibly some Orthodox church people do that as well. It's probably linked to the belief that saints in glory (i.e physically dead believers  in heaven) can intercede for one with God. Protestants don't generally do that as they like their prayers to go direct  to Jesus and God the Father. In fact it can seem a bit vain from our viewpoint since Mary is just one human spirit, and we humans are not really made to be able to deal with the individualised interactions of millions of other humans, although God who is infinite can do so easily. But if it makes them feel good, well it has some merit, as anything soothing does; I think it may be used  a lot as an act of penance when catholics confess sins to their priest in confession, although I got that  impression from various films and haven't ever confessed my sins to a catholic priest.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should have addressed the question to catholics since protestants don't do this particular prayer !|`|ede03e3f3d0f9724bf8ab35b7949daafaa	Prayer is talking to God.<br>  The Scripture Union used to  have(and maybe still does) a wee list suggesting a way of composing a prayer. It was helpful, but as in any conversation, our conversations with God depend on what we want to say.<br>  Nevertheless it went something like this.<br>  Address God, saying who he is/magnify him<br>  Thank /praise/glorify him for his goodness, and what he has done.<br>  Repent of your sins, and ask him to forgive you and help you to live as he wants you to..<br>  Bring your requests to him for those you are concerned for, for the world, for those who need to know Him, that God's will be done in your life and in the world.<br>  Pray in the name of Jesus.<br>  You will see that this outline also roughly folllows the pattern of the Lord's Prayer that Jesus taught the disciples.<br>  Oops I never answered the question! You can say the prayer audibly or in silence-God hears it either way. God hears and answers prayer. However there are conditions, so we don't always get what we pray for. It may not be God's will, or God's time, or we may have things to resolve first that God is waiting for us to deal with, or that we did not believe he would answer the prayer.. If we don't see an answer, it does not mean God did not hear the prayer, or that he does not answer prayers.<br>  The Bible says our prayers should be sincere, we need to believe that god answers prayer, and that we should be righteous (good). It also talks about persevering in prayer if we are serious about something-not to do a quick prayer one day and then dropping it. <br>  If I remember correctly the Bible says that the fervent (heartfelt) prayer of a righteous (good) man availleth much(succeeds)|`|PWankIUpaa	You have chosen a bad example. <br>  <br>  Prayer at its best is a time of Worship , Praise and Fellowship with the God who made you. We all should be in Constant prayer every day in every situation.|`|AA11207604	if repetiton is bad then why does a priest tell you to say 14 hail marys<br>  or 10 our fathers when you go to confession<br>  yet another contradiction in christianity|`|CEQpDpnPaa	i don't hail Hitler and I don't hail Mary<br>  <br>  i pary to the Lord|`|jD1JY0BJaa	Haha good point. Maybe prayers would work better if, say, god actually existed?|`|ciUjxhFlaa	Hailing Mary won't do you any good. Praising God will do everything. God is the one who has done everything for us, and was spat on for us. Mary just served him for him. Prayer is talking with God, us speaking to him and God speaking to you.|`|cF4fAj6jaa	I'm not familiar with "hail mary"s and Catholic customs and stuff.<br>  But generally, prayer is how we talk to God.<br>  That's exactly what it is, a conversation with God.|`|5ef9a88b72fdef3c34ff828c4027752faa	Sigh ... please ask at least a question that shows even a slight understanding of someones beliefs or religion before expecting such an answer.|`|vfhbs3qPaa	Prayer is talking to God.
pqveENjUaa	Because they are comedians. Comedians make jokes to entertain, and usually to the religious people the jokes are made "out of ignorance." Unfortunately, comedians aren't taken seriously as public speakers, so even if the comedian has a great point the public is going to ignore it because of the fact that the point was presented as a joke.|`|m1AXfDX0aa	90 percent of Americans aren't christians.

He is one of the 4 horse men.<br>  <br>  "People don't actually believe in God, they believe in a belief in God.  If they actually believed in God literally, they would be taking serious risks that would be extremely dangerous to themselves, like giving away all their possessions, living on the street, constantly evangelizing, even if it means their death.  People don't do that."<br>  <br>  I paraphrased it.<br>  <br>  Anybody who is a believer or unbeliever all agree on 99% of things.  They all agree that 99% of all gods and beliefs are retarded BS.  The christians / believers just happen to continue to believe in their one God.  The atheists just went one step further and believe in no God.  Many of the American Christians or believers probably will tell you that they see the Bible / God as a moral teacher, but they don't actually believe all the fairy tale stories that science has proven to be wrong.<br>  <br>  I also think that people laugh at the anti-religion jokes, because they have vaguely thought of all those concepts themselves.  But like the sheep they are, never finished their thoughts, articulated them, stood up for them or brought them to any serious conclusion.  When a comedian speaks it and puts it together in a clever way, they can laugh because they recognize that that garbage is such obvious non-sense.  It is like they are enjoying their own de-conversion as the comedian helps facilitate it.|`|TzogAxLFaa	How many Christians does it take to change a light-bulb?<br>  Three - but they're really only one.<br>  <br>  How many Buddhists does it take to change a lightbulb?<br>  Four; one to change it, one to not change it, one to not not change it, and one to do none of the above.<br>  <br>  How many Jewish Grandmothers does it take to change a lightbulb?<br>  None - "Don't worry, I'll just sit here in the dark."<br>  <br>  How many Muslims does it take to change a lightbulb?<br>  One.

I don’t know for sure; I can only speculate.<br>  <br>  Sometimes comedians make jokes about things they don’t actually believe in, but pretend they do for the sake of the joke.

They pay lip service to faith because they think all their friends and family are faithful, and are afraid that they'll be socially ostracized if they are honest about their doubts and lack of faith.  They indoctrinate their kids, not because they believe in what is being taught, but because they've been taught that it's the "right" thing to do.<br>  <br>  They laugh at George Carlin and smirk at Bill Maher because they secretly agree, and wish they had the guts to say the same thing.<br>  <br>  I think the actual number of faithful in America is probably much, much lower than any poll indicates, it's just that everyone's too afraid of what the neighbours might say - never realizing that all the neighbours feel exactly the same way.|`|AA12194228	Just because people laugh does not mean they agree with the joke.

George Carlin was a contemporary of my father and both went to Catholic school.  I know from speaking to my father that the things Carlin describes in his act pertaining to catholic school are dead on target.  So is your problem with his jokes that there is no truth to them, or that there is too much truth?|`|80JBvRdFaa	You don't have to agree with what they say If you can't learn to take satire or criticism you will be a miserable person.

ru5qKN4eaa	Well, actually, I have a situation that is not unlike your idea...    When I met my boyfriend, I was thin, then I gained some weight (I'm not tlaking a little, either lol)...    Well, now I'm just getting back to where I was and I feel great about myself.    He never changed.  He told me I was beautiful when I was thin, fat, and in the middle.  The only thing that ever changed was me.    Now that I'm thin again, we can do more things that we could never do when I was fat... I suppose that's the only thing that's changed.    I can't tell you he's not happy that I lost the weight because I know he likes to go out with me more, but he's never said anything bad to me or been mean to me... ever.    And if anyone ever is... dump them.    The fact of the matter is, that if someone tries to change you, they simply aren't good people.  You change for yourself, like I did.  I knew I wasn't healthy, so I made the right moves and changed my lifestyle.  NOw I'm happy, healthy and I have a life again.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I'm confused. Do you mean say your crush didn't like you before but now likes you because you made an improvement in your appearance? Would you go out with your crush?     No. I did not. I had one guy who was a jerk (never crushed on him) tell me I was ugly and when I made some changes - said how did you get to be so beautiful? I tolerated him. A jerk is a jerk.     There was a guy in high school that I crushed on. But he did like me and I ruined it. I was so insecure and nervous that I couldn't really talk to me. I was all weird and stupid. He liked me as I was as far as I know. If I found out that he liked me because I became hot then I would not have gone out with him because I have self respect.|`|jbDTsZyBaa	As long as he wasn't mean to me before.
Yl9gFLTZaa	WTH is a subjuntive irregular verb?? :S :S    Oh ok ok, the subjuntive irregular verb, means something that you are wishing, or willing or it is not a complete true statement.    i.e.    Quiero que me traigas algn regalo.  i want u 2 bring me a gift.    Dudo que llegue hoy.  i dont think he arrive today.        Os digo que me escribis.  i want that u write me.      Te prohbo que fumes aqu.  i denied u to smoke here      Te aconsejo que estudies ms.    Me extra?a que no est aqu hoy.    Me gusta que lo hagas as.          You could make it visual with some sentences.    Like    Lo besare en cuanto lo vea.    I will kiss him just when i see him.    And you could put a draw with a girl waiting for her bf or something like that.    Good luck

ahBKJaVpaa	I think that our society has deluded kids to think they can have every thing without lifting a finger. Times have changed alot since I was a kid and back then you were encouraged to work for what you wanted. Now that our economy has really been hit, I think that kids will see what work really is, if they can find it. Kids also need some life learning to see that not every kid like them has what they have.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	I think the media is forcing them to grow up much faster then they should. I think that they are being cheated out of having having a childhood because advertising agencies want to make a quick buck off of their insecurities. I also think they are the most neglected in our society. Child molesters get less time in jail than drug dealers. Bastards who touch a child should get the death penalty, but instead they get slaps on the wrists. Our public school systems are inadequate, and children in the supposedly "best" country in the world are homeless, starving, and neglected. In a nation that produces enough food to feed seven times the current entire human population three square meals a day every day, there is no reason, especially in our society, for any of our most precious resources (our children) to go hungry.

Why can't pastors come to that same realization?<br>  <br>  You're welcome!|`|hiRYCT2Haa	He was picked on a belief that he was , "close to God". This happens when the old Dalai Lama dies. They actually searched for over a year before several monks choose him to be the next Dalai Lama. And he is a very unconventional monk to say the least. He himself doesn't believe he is anything special, only that people believe he is.<br>  <br>  But I guess in the position he's in, that kind of modesty IS special.<br>  <br>  He is a huge history and science buff, and spends most of his day reading these 2 subjects and many others. His library looks my old High Schools, except probably better.<br>  <br>  He is also one of the most open minded and liberal religious person you might ever find.|`|KR3AYA7faa	He explains himself better than anyone else can. Why don't you try reading some of his writings? He is an interesting and thoughtful man, even to an atheist like me!<br>  <br>  p.s. He need not have achieved enlightenment to be the Dalai Lama

Given that the event is not an eye-witness account (the Gospels were all written after the events described in them), and the fact that the magi ("wise men" or "astrologers" -- those who could read signs in the sky) visited after the birth by as much as a couple of years, then the nova is very likely to be the star.<br>  <br>  The movement (or lack thereof) of the star really seems to be immaterial to the event. The fact that a nova occurred substantiates the story of a "Star of Bethlehem" and is reasonable.

HI0GitEYaa	Get him something he wants... I got a new Carhartt Jacket last year. I love it.|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	it doesn't really matter (as long as it's not matching sweaters...ew) he's no going to break up with you over a box of chocolates if that's all you get him. You could get him something that he's interested in, only you know what that is|`|y8jIXgOdaa	get something for you ;)  he will love it later on that night...|`|SbZ71ME4aa	I'm not sure what sports he likes- but customized things are always cute. For my boyfriends birthday I got him golf balls with "Happy Birthday John! Love, Eleni" on them. He loves them! You can customize a lot of different sports equipment at customink.com    Also I've always found wonderful clothes for guys at Express and Ralph Lauren. Express has great jackets, and Ralph has the sexy polos. They also have great cologne. Like Ralph Lauren Black, It's my favorite. You could also try something cute like red heart boxers at American Eagle.     Or if you want to go all out Kay Jewelers has great Citizen watches for anywhere between $100 and $500. He might really appreciate that, especially with a romantic message engraved on the back! And of course he'll appreciate a card decorated with hearts telling him you love him. The last place I want to suggest is soapcard.com. It's adorable, you can customize bars of soap!     Good luck!    P.S. Try personalizationmall.com|`|LXEqtNlbaa	just make something yourself like a scrapbook of pictures of ye and Design it with colourful colours and stuff, best presents are ones you make yourself|`|KLU2fp1Haa	http://www.findgift.com/gift-ideas/pid-1...    tons of great ideas here ! hope this helps !|`|mIRHRdS4aa	Your question was a grammatical disaster. I'm not even sure what you were trying to say. You want to get him something you already have? Befor. You should get yourself frickin' grammer lessons. Oh, get him a dildo. Bet he doesn't have that.|`|e6NisIC9aa	I had the same problem last Christmas.    Just try getting him some CD's or movies he's been wanting. If he likes video games, get him a few of those. DON'T get him clothes. Maybe you could do something special. Pick something that's very close to him and find a way to make a present out of that. Guys say they never want anything, but I'm sure he'd still appreciate it. :)|`|12IRO36Vaa	my boyfriend and i will have been dating for a year and 8 mths when valentine's day rolls around. i got him some really nice clothes from express, a bottle of cologne (my favorite kind :) and an ipod adapter for his car. i'm also decorating his car with foil balloons, streamers, etc. the morning of the 14th so he can wake up to a big surprise!    is there anything the two of you like to do together? for example, my boyfriend and i love to go to concerts together, so i could get us concert tickets to see his favorite band. and we love i-spy books, so i could make a basket of i-spy books.    you and i probably don't share the exact same interests, but mine are meant to maybe spark some ideas for you!
6GU7JwNAaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto Jewi...|`|uuHDQr1paa	I got mugged and beat up in one.  The Jew was HUGE.|`|CzBNTeLAaa	There were three types of ghettos: closed ghettos, open ghettos, and destruction ghettos.     In the closed ghettos they were surrounded by barbed wire and walls, and armed guards. They were allowed little food, medical care, and inadequate living quarters (very crowed which caused disease). Except for the walls and wire, the conditions in other ghettos were similar. Little food, medical care, and unsanitary conditions.    In the "open ghettos" the houses were marked, but still guarded and conditions very poor.    In destruction ghettos, Jews were in temporary "housing". Which inside they were stacked upon one an other like sardines in rows and rows of bunks, that were small and hard (wood, no mattresses, etc.). The Jews were either shot and placed in mass graves or deported to the "killing centers" to be murdered. These ghettos where shortly destroyed after the Jews were killed or deported. (Germans covering their tracks)    The largest ghetto in Poland was the Warsaw ghetto, where over 400,000 Jews were crowded into an area of 1.3 square miles.  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lan...    Read this too: http://www.rossel.net/Holocaust07.htm|`|NofRnN61aa	If your talking about the ones Nazi Germany made Jewish people live in then they must have been;  Scary!  Intimidating!  Hungry!  Nervous!      Imagine being made to live in a town whilst knowing one day soon you would be killed.  An awful time in the history of the world.|`|MQ1QVNXbaa	They were forced out of there homes and into a small congested neighborhood where they had to live for a while until they were ready to be sent off the the concentration camps. The ghettos were horrible living conditions. Not much water. Babies cried. Children whined. But the living conditions in the Jewish ghettos were not half as bad as the living conditions in the camps where they were transported to.

B52KNW7Haa	Hug him when he makes a joke.  When you start to pull back from the hug kiss him.  No tongue just one of those parted lips ones.  Then say "sorry I just have been wanting to do that for a while now."  And then ask "was that okay?"    I know I would go crazy if a girl did that to me.|`|DH0CcjGiaa	Well I know this might sound goofy. But when me and my b/f started going out he would always ask before doing something. Like when he wanted to kiss me for the first time he asked if it was ok. Just when yall are alone one day just ask him if it's ok for you to kiss him. If he says no then he's not ready. That don't mean he don't like you. it's just means he don't want to go that fast and when he's ready he will let you know. I promise good things are worth waiting for. and when you get that first kiss you will know that was the right time.|`|3972dcebce6b2f1b72be1c48572bf2a5aa	if you listen to any one's answer, it wont be fun neither will it be something to remember.     do it your own way. discover it with him. share the decision with him. make it worth a while. trust me it will contribute to the life time of your relationship.|`|KLU2fp1Haa	maybe he's more shy when he's around u, he's probably hoping you'll make the move because he's probably nervous that you'll turn him down....give him a big one !|`|UY6mkCk2aa	Just slowly lean in at the right moment and give him a peck on the check or lips, he might be shy so you have to start slow. And don't do it in front of all yours' or his friends, he might think that you just want to show off, and besides being alone is a lot more romantic.|`|ktqroat6aa	just go for it. it sounds like this guy likes you so there is no way he wont be into a kiss
JO8YzDNVaa	Because they are easy targets in the public eye.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	part of it is there refusal to testifying .someone makes an accusation and you have to prove your not guilty. show biz types have always been strong defenders of the first amendment and the witch hunt was definitely a violation of it
stAeoUeSaa	Here are three ways to prove it to yourself.      I. First: You exist.   If matter-energy can NOT be created, but here we all are 'existing'. This implies the very hand of God leaving every atheist staring in the mirror asking themselves, "But how?"      II. Second: Big Bang and other cosmological evidence.   If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence      The Bible also alludes to the Big Rip:   Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip      III. Third: The fulfillment of hundreds of Biblical prophecies.  For instance here is one that was prophesied almost 2 millennia ago, yet has manifested itself now. Revelation 13:16-18   http://www.verichipcorp.com/|`|PDJjy0bPaa	Nope|`|BKJEJWV5aa	Yes absolutely He died on the cross for you so that if you repent of our sins and follow Him you can spend eternity in heaven!|`|tuULGJS6aa	No, they're all fiction.|`|2dxJjh6faa	Duhh|`|Kru3PZbkaa	I believe in the existence of many gods.  What it all boils down to is which one(s) do I chose to worship.  I work with Odin, Freya, and Loki at all times.  I've also worked with Thor, Balder, Ostara, Sif, Frigga, Forseti, and Uller to name a few.  If you speak of the Christian god, I believe that there are at least two of them, if not more.  What the Catholics worship, and what the Baptists worship are two very different things.|`|AA11604319	Yes.|`|UVeT0nmTaa	most definitely|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Yes!

I don't believe in them, but I enjoy reading their myths.|`|rFtdWGjSaa	yes i do.|`|pbabXHd2aa	Yes, I believe in God. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died for the sins of the world and has opened up heaven for those who believe in him and try to follow him.I believe that God is the author and sustainer of all life. I believe that life and love are eternal and that they go on forever. When a man and a woman fall in love and have a family, you can see the presence of God. God works through them to bring new life into the world. Only God could do this. So, yes I believe in God.|`|AfX3gjBTaa	yes i believe in The GOD ALMIGHTY and JESUS CHRIST with all my heart and know that he created all live on earth.|`|3fPm0eeOaa	Yes I Do!

And by the way, being a Christian isn't just praying a prayer one time.

93c878b05606a22f5b62decd4c13ecc9aa	I think we should feel extremely cautious and self-distrustful to see what depths we might also be capable of sinking to under the influence of others.  Knowing that other, apparently good citizens, were capable of participating in such horrendous acts should make us feel humbled and guarded against making similar mistakes.    Specific lessons we can learn from the holocaust include the following:    1) Our leaders may not always do what is right; therefore, we should not follow blindly.  2) The majority may not always do what is right; therefore, we must think for ourselves.  3) We may not, ourselves, understand what is right; therefore, we must be cautious and guarded against our own ego and pride.  4) Only God has the power to protect us from evil--both from its harm, and from the doing of it; therefore, we must seek to know Him.    "There, but for the grace of God, go I."    Blessings.
TDLdVmqEaa	If diversity was gone, the world would be soooo dull and boring!   I mean, everyone being the same is no better than everyone being clones or grey blobs or something.  And you know, it'd just be a matter of time before something else caused wars, hate, and violence. Its typical human behavior for something like jealousy or something to spark those types of things, even if everyone looked exactly alike.|`|YupMCYHlaa	If everyone was the same race, yes there would be no racism.  But in order to get to that place we'd have to kill 5/6 of the world's population, so maybe racism is better. 8^)    Also, if everyone was blonde and blue-eyed, people would still say they were more blonde and blue-eyed that someone else, so racism would start all over again.    In Africa there's been a war going on between the Hutus and the Tutsis for about a century.  Both tribes have been in power at one time or another and have done their best to wipe out the other tribe.  To your or me they look pretty much the same, but they can tell each other apart and each tribe doesn't believe the other deserves to take up space on earth.  And the thing is, they lived together in  harmony for centuries until the Belgians took over their country. The Belgians began measuring the width of noses and the height of foreheads to show them the differences between each other, so one of the tribes could be enslaved.  And they've been at each other's throats since then.    Biologists tell us race is artificial.  We are all so alike that it's impossible to tell us apart once the skin is off. We even have interchangeable parts--you can get an organ transplant from someone of a different race and never tell the difference.  So the whole idea of race is man-made.  If race didn't exist, we'd come up with some other artificial means to separate people into 'us' and 'them'.  It's just our nature.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	ok but full of hatred.....no it wouldnt|`|rUDMEyf1aa	Sure but let's be real, this is PURELY academic.|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	it would have never worked you do you honestly think hitler could have killed off every race instead of the blonde hair bue eyed people this world would be boring an stupid hitler was a pshyco|`|305noKSXaa	All of jews would be dead.

oMF6bXCZaa	When the second world war ended, I was a young teen.  I had met a P.O.W. in Church, just talked to him when Church ended and continued a correspondence with him for many years when he was returned back to Italy.    We wrote back and forwards for many years.  In those days one didn't even think of travelling from England to Italy, unless you were quite rich.   I immigrated to Canada and about a year after I had left,.he turned up at the house I used to live at, and my father would not give him my Canadian address.  He had just come to see me he turned around and went back to Italy empty handed.    All the years that we corresponded he asked me to correct the English in his letters and return them.  In otherwords,  teach him how to write in the English Language properly.  I did that for nearly four years.    40 Years later, I travelled to Italy and visited him and his wife (after much searching I had found his address).  He was married with a child.  I was married with six children.    He told me that because I had helped him with his English, he had become a Professor of English language at the local University.  He thank me profusly and said if it hadn't been for me, he would never have become a Professor.   I think he died a few years ago, and I was unable to re connect with his wife and child, so I just left it alone.    We never know  when we are younger, if the things we do, the things we say, or our actions,  will influence  someones life in a way we would not even guess at.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	When I was in Jr. High, my Geography teacher got the class interested in having a pen pal as a class project. He had their names in a box & one by one, we chose a name. He had a little bit of info on each person, & we had to get in touch with that pen pal, then share that info with our teacher & class. My pen pal was from Melbourne, Australia. We stayed in touch for a while, then for some reason, we fell out of touch. I still remember her name, street, hobbies, etc. I don't think kids have pen pals anymore since they were introduced to MySpace, Facebook, Classmates. com, etc.|`|8G42oyydaa	Yes a young man from Texas who went off to Vietnam and we lost touch.  I was younger than he was and too young to appreciate the significance of the war.  I was 13.      Never head from him again, I have checked the wall to see if his name is on it, it isnt. I have tried to google him and come up with the name of an author who has written books on the Vietnam war. Is it the same person?

So much laughing at all our life up and downs and good and bad.  It is a good thing.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	I had a pen pal in 7th & 8th (1959 & 60) grades from a small island in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius.  In 1978, I reported on board the Flag Ship for the Middle East Forces, USS LaSalle AGF-3.  In 1979, we went to Mauritius.  Her address was so easy to remember.  Number ONE on her street.  I caught a bus out there and got directions to her street.  When I got there, the person said she was at work (she had moved back home after her husband died) and would be home around 5.  He asked who I was and I told him to tell her "Her American friend stopped by."  I got back a little after 5 and the house was full of people. My CO didn't believe I knew someone on Mauritius.  After our 3rd day there, I got permission to bring her and 2 of her friends to the ship.  They got to meet my CO and he was really surprised.  She and I wrote for several years after, then she wrote to tell me she was getting married again.  I told her it might be best that we didn't write because I didn't want to cause problems with her and her new husband.   They are of Chinese decent, speak a dialect  of French very close to the American Cajun (one of my shipmates was Cajun and he said it sounded just like it...and he spoke Cajun to a waiter and the waiter understood).  She has a French first name and a Chinese last name.  So does her husband.  Occasionally we will send a card to each other, and we exchanged pictures of our families.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	Yes I did, a girl in MA and a guy in England.

Mine were from Germany (both West and East), Poland, Czechoslovakia, the USSR (when those two countries were still called those names), Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Guatemala, Mexico and Canada. I practiced my foreign languages and traded stamps with most.  The most interesting of my correspondents was a guy from East Germany who I didn't hear from for close to a year at one time. Then all of a sudden, a letter from him arrived....postmarked from West Germany! He had escaped, using some of his knowledge of the border and the laying of the land mines which he had learned while serving in the East German army, and made it safely to the West!  One of my Polish penpals learned French fluently and somehow wangled an invitation to stay with a French family, travelled there and never returned to Poland.

GuBF5xhDaa	I know where you are going, but people like him are too blind to see anything that can't be repeated in the lab. Perhaps he has forgotten that a few hundred years ago, everything he knows as "medical fact" was considered mindless drivel invented by heretics looking to overthrow the church. Those people had to endure being mocked, ridiculed, and threatened, and had work really hard and die to prove they were telling the truth. Just because something is not accepted by the general public, does not mean it is not real.    In my opinion, the nurse should take his "real education" to the medical section, where someone might actually care what he has to say.|`|ykeCqwfoaa	YES!!!

WMrNa3Doaa	I don't see us as being better than animals, because I think we are animals. I know people, with their intelligence and mortgage payments and churches like to think that these things set them apart, but really, each species has it's own characteristics that set it apart from the others.  I mean, biologically speaking, we're just another mammal.<br>  <br>  As far as the food chain, yes, I eat meat. But other animals eat meat as well. I don't feel good or bad about it, I just consider it nature. I believe that they should be killed in the most humane/painless way possible, however.<br>  <br>  That being said, I am 100% with you about the ethical treatment of animals, and I think people who abuse them should be SEVERELY punished. Animals depend on us, since we seem to have declared ourselves rulers of the world, and as such, it is our duty to protect them, not torture or abuse them. Or even give them away because our new landlord won't let us have a pet. Move somewhere else,  then. You know?|`|6uFaP2OAaa	Honey, we don't even have the 'eye for an eye' motto for when humans hurt and kill other humans.  What chance to you have applying that for animals?  <br>  You're right about animal abusers needing harsher penalties.  Most seem to get off with a fine and a ban on owning animals in the future (which isn't really policed well enough) but the people who make the laws usually care about themselves and people more than animals.  Animal activists are seen as nuts, and their opinions and requests/demands usually ignored because of that.<br>  <br>  I love animals, I'm going to study to be a veterinary nurse after I complete my current degree.  But I don't find people killing animals to eat them disgusting.  It's the natural order of things; animals eat other animals.  We are built to eat a varied diet including meat; hence canine teeth.|`|Qlpj04L3aa	We are better. We are set apart because we can reason. Its just nature. I'm sorry but if people didn't use animals for food, there would be many starving. I would kill an animal to feed my family and it would not be wrong in my mind.|`|o1Qmp8Hhaa	ANIMALS ARE WAY BETTER THAN HUMANS!!!!!!!!!!|`|33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	Animals better than people? No, animals may be better that shi**y people, but not better than people in general... and what animals are you talking about? Domestic animal abuse? hunting?.... cause if you're against domestic animal abuse, i agree, pretty disgusting. If you're talking about hunting I completely disagree, humans are indeed intended to kill animals and eat them. Hence why you have canine teeth. Canine teeth are only found on animals that have meat as a part of their diet. Carnivores and omnivores alike.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Do you know what I think when I see those PETA propaganda pamphlets with cute little piglets being slaughtered? I think of bacon or pork chops and I think of how yummy they are! <br>  <br>  I eat meat! I also wear fur and I like it, I've even gone hunting and fishing, I love meat and eat it with every meal. By the way I love Shark Fin soup!|`|LRHjirzhaa	I think that we should respect all life, but when it comes to the eating meat part I think it's completely natural as long as you're not using any inhumane way of killing the animal. Eating meat is part of our natural process, just like it is for other animals. I mean, we're animals too aren't we?|`|PR28wVHzaa	I think that I am better than other animals because I CAN think I'm better.<br>  <br>  Abusing any living thing is wrong and should be illegal.|`|8saJmjm9aa	i completely agree. <br>  we're all animals. we're all equal.|`|BhEsZMG8aa	Mmmm...cows are delicious.|`|115f83270b61c101db1fc9c9dc8644cdaa	I don't think YOU should consider yourself better than an animal. Like your sister the cow would say "mooooooron".|`|GrqsnWtiaa	I like Beef Chicken and Seafood, does that make me a bad person?|`|hXQnR2Scaa	There are laws protecting animals.<br>  <br>  And being at the top makes us more successful.<br>  But, how is our killing of animals for food or other uses any different than lions killing antelope for food?<br>  <br>  Or are you saying that every carnivorous creature is also "disgusting"?
bAbZMg0oaa	he just screams paranoia. he was probably waiting for the insults to come streaming in, so his mental defense was to think everyone around him is gay.|`|QklWVYbLaa	Yeah, next time you hear anyone make fun of anyone or even if you hear other people call you gay or queer, that means they're seriously gay.<br>  It has been proofed by scientist, that people who are always trying to make fun of gay people are gay themselves.

b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	It's a proven fact that legalizing prostitution lowers sex crimes in that area.|`|2fZKpW9yaa	The average age for a rapist is 31 years old, meaning they aren't teenagers with a pent up need to have sex. If prostitution were legal, i believe it would cut the number of reported rape in half because most rapist are not serial rapist they are serial criminals. So the way i look at it a criminal who has not had sex in a while is thinking, "i'm a good criminal and i want sex. well when i want money i just go and take it. maybe i can do the same with sex." but the question is about crimes of a sexual nature, which would also include molestation. assuming roughly the same number of people are victims of the two crimes that would reduce crimes of a sexual nature by roughly 25%.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	It don't ~ details are alreaady given.|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	Maybe sex crimes would decrease, if these men had somewhere to go for sex.|`|BNPywlwnaa	prostisution is legalized!?! i didnt no dat,,,, dese ppl hav no respect 4 women|`|8G42oyydaa	Sexual violence is VIOLENCE against women, it isnt about sex at all. It is either a hate crime or the offender is seriously mentally unbalanced.    There are prostitutes now, it doesnt stop these men from preying on women.     There are men who believe women are not equal human beings,and who cant control the rage they have over women being treated as equals and not their chattels to abuse as they wish, and enslave.    There are violent offenders who are never kept in prison and thereby prevented  from re-entering society to harm more women and/or children.     IMO any man who commits a sex crime and there is undeniable proof should be declared a violent offender and never released.     In some countries he would be put to death, and that works for me too.|`|vd1YIMbaaa	I know I will get a thumbs down for this but I think it would be beneficial to potential rapists to act out their rape fantasies for a price...   idk for sure    the girls above have a solid point though|`|2R3iJnFPaa	Sex crimes are about power, control, and humiliation, not about sexual desire.  Legalized prostitution has no effect on sex crimes.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Crimes of a sexual nature usually take place because of a lack of other available sexual outlets. This could be at the time of the rape or due to attitudes created in the rapist earlier in life. If prostitution is legalized I think it would lessen the crime only about 25 %. . . You would still have the frustrated teenager, who wants it now, or cannot afford a prostitute. . A visit to the house of ill repute is planned in advance. . . and I feel most sex crimes are of a spontaneous nature. . . It may reduce it some. . . but not all.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	would have no effect what so ever!!!|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	This question has been tossed around for years and many studies done in it.

It might put a person in a more vulnerable position to be victimized...but not because of said profession.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	It doesn't.|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	I agree with Autumn and those who say much the same. Rapists don't go to hookers, there kick comes from the violence.|`|AA10181795	If you are talking about crimes such as rape, which is not a crime of sexual passion, but of rage, legalizing prostitution would make no difference.   If it's a crime to sell or buy sex in a particular city, then by legalizing it, it would cease to be a crime. That would be a change.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	It doesn't, Wiseman  and a few of the others are right.

JMOLRKRraa	free into, www.tarot.com|`|YXGdwwTJaa	There is a book to go with this, the classic set may now count as an antique!  But it is still a good guide for beginners, only I would suggest finding a 'prettier' one that you enjoy.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Okay.  The 22 cards that are numbered 0 - XXI (21) are the Major Arcana:  The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess, The Empress, etc.  The Major Arcana describes the ongoing journey of "The Fool", each card holds its own symbolism, but ties into the others as well.  The rest are the Minor Arcana - suit cards, of which you have Ace thru King in each of four suits: Wands, Pentacles, Cups, and Swords.  The one you describe here is just that - the 3 of swords.  With tarot, the type of card/suit, the number, and other symbolism on the card all play into interpreting its meaning.<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking a tarot course.  Your question of "what do I do with the numbered cards" can't be answered here.  It takes quite some time to learn the cards in depth and become adept at reading/interpreting tarot.<br>  <br>  Here is an online taorot course based on the Waite decks that will help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.learntarot.com/</a><br>  <br>  There's also an excellent book that is helpful for learning this deck (IMHO, much better and easier to work with than the one that comes with the Waite set.) - though the name of the author is escaping me at the moment, so I will add that info here when I get home and can look at my own copy.<br>  <br>  Added:  The book I was referring to is "Easy Tarot Guide" by Marcia Masino.  Great descriptions of each card as individuals and how they relate to each other, and numerous exercises to help you get to know and learn to interpret your cards.|`|vhlORK4Waa	You need to go on a tarot course, as it will take more time than I have or Yahoo! Answers permits to go through some possible interpretations of you Waite deck.<br>  You could buy books and learn the set meanings, and then work out your own.<br>  <br>  Why did you buy them?<br>  <br>  Read my earlier answers to you on these topics!!<br>  <br>  The Major Arcana are the Tarot cards with the most symbolic and divinatory importance. There are 22 Major Arcana, numbered from 0 to 21, each of which is individually named and illustrated.<br>  <br>  The major Arcana are also known as the "trumps" (from "triumphs") of the Tarot deck. Some call them Atu - hence "Atu XVIII" refers to The Moon.<br>  <br>  People often ask what the cards "mean". That's an impossible question. Each individual Tarot deck has its own imagery and symbolism which must then be filtered through the psyche of the reader and the context of the question. Understanding the meaning of Tarot cards is ultimately a very personal thing. That's why it's important to try several different decks before settling on one - even then you'll probably find that different decks are best suited to different questions or just different moods.<br>  <br>  While the major arcana expresses universal themes, the minor arcana brings those themes down into the practical arena to show how they operate in daily events. The minor arcana cards represent the concerns, activities and emotions that make up the dramas of our everyday lives. <br>  <br>  There are 56 cards in the minor arcana divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles. [Note] Each of these suits stands for a particular approach to life. <br>  <br>  Wands<br>  The Wands are the suit of creativity, action and movement. They are associated with such qualities as enthusiasm, adventure, risk-taking and confidence. This suit corresponds to the yang, or masculine principle, in Chinese philosophy and is associated with the element Fire. A flickering flame is the perfect symbol of the Wands force. This energy flows outward and generates passionate involvement. <br>  <br>  Cups<br>  The Cups are the suit of emotions and spiritual experience. They describe inner states, feelings and relationship patterns. The energy of this suit flows inward. Cups correspond to the yin, or feminine principle, in Chinese philosophy and are associated with the element Water. The ability of water to flow and fill up spaces, to sustain and to reflect changing moods makes it the ideal symbol of the Cups suit. <br>  <br>  Swords<br>  The Swords are the suit of intellect, thought and reason. They are concerned with justice, truth and ethical principles. Swords are associated with the element Air. A cloudless sky, open and light-filled, is a symbol of the mental clarity that is the Swords ideal. This suit is also associated with states that lead to disharmony and unhappiness. Our intellect is a valuable asset, but as an agent of ego, it can lead us astray if it is not infused with the wisdom of our Inner Guide. <br>  <br>  Pentacles<br>  The Pentacles are the suit of practicality, security and material concerns. They are associated with the element Earth and the concrete requirements of working with matter. In Pentacles, we celebrate the beauty of nature, our interactions with plants and animals and our physical experiences in the body. Pentacles also represent prosperity and wealth of all kinds. Sometimes this suit is called the Coins, an obvious symbol of the exchange of goods and services in the physical world. <br>  <br>  Each minor arcana suit has a distinct quality all its own. Our everyday experiences are a blend of these four approaches.

Excluding Sundays, it is 40 days long and it is a time where we fast and sacrifice something as we prepare for Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross and his resurrection on Easter. <br>  <br>  It is 40 days long to signify Christ's time in the desert in which he fasted and prayed. <br>  <br>  Sundays are excluded because this is a day of rest and for God, thus we lay down our sacrifices so that we may focus on God, but many Catholics continue through the entire time. <br>  <br>  We give something up because Jesus gave up His life for us. Thus we feel that once a year, we should also be able to give something up for God. It is usually something that is hard to give up, i.e. I'm giving up biting my nails, it's almost impossible for me not to. <br>  <br>  Others give up soda or chocolate while some will fast for 40 days. It depends on what is a sacrifice to you, but it also has to be something you can keep, though difficult.<br>  <br>  Saying something like, you're giving up homework isn't something you can keep because you'll fail your classes and it isn't that difficult. Or giving up sugar when you're a diabetic is a cheap way out. <br>  <br>  During these forty days, Catholics contemplate Christ's Passion, death and Resurrection while offering our own sacrifices to God throughout Lent. It is also a time of forgiveness and penance, it is why during Lent many Catholic churches offer more Confessional times so that we may prepare for Easter and receive worthily.|`|PWankIUpaa	This is not Christian however for Catholics they think that you can buy God's favor by good Works when we are clearly told in the Bible that Good Works are as filthy rags.<br>  <br>  Titus 3:5 Not by the  works of righteousness<br>  Galatians 2:16  Not justified by works <br>  Romans 3:20  deeds ...no flesh shall be justified<br>  <br>  Go back and read the whole verses the meanings will come through even better.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	The observance of Lent began a century of so after the Resurrection of Christ. The earliest references to a lenten type observance can be found in writings of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria from 248 - 265. It wasn't called Lent yet, but from his writings it is obvious that it is already a traditional practice, so we know it was observed even earlier.<br>  <br>  It's about preparing for Easter. Just as we prepare for Christmas during Advent, we prepare for Easter during Lent. <br>  <br>  We give something up as a way to do penance and make sacrifices. Christ made the greatest sacrifice of all. When we make small sacrifices, it helps us to remember what he did for us. Lent is 40 days long. The 40 days remembers the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert before he began his public ministry. Also, the Jews wandered in the desert for 40 years before being delivered to the promised land. In both cases there there is sacrifice and self denial before realizing joy. So it is with Lent, 40 days of penance followed by the great joy and glory of Easter. <br>  <br>  It begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Easter. Technically Lent ends on Holy Thursday but at that point we enter what is referred to as the Triduum. Then comes Easter.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Lent is the 40 days leading up to Easter, and starts on Ash Wednsday.<br>  <br>  The giving up of something is in spiritual preparation for Easter, which is the highest holy day in the Catholic liturgical calendar.|`|rRVzWFYZaa	Lent, strictly speaking, is the 40 days before Easter.  Christians are supposed to prepare for Easter by praying, alms-giving, self-denial, and penitence  <br>  <br>  Catholics give up something and refrain from eating meat on Fridays and Ash Wednesday as self denial.  They fast on Ash Wednesday and get ashes as penitence|`|zvafRreyaa	here youll find it in the original KJV 1611 <br>  <br>  Lent<br>  Septuagesima Sunday<br>  <a href="http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=kjbible&PagePosition=29" rel="nofollow">http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/pri...</a>|`|bRBZ5KX3aa	jesus abstained from food and water for 40 days and nights while he was tempted by the devil in the dessert. for lent you are ment to give up something to experiance what jesus went through to bring you closer to him<br>  <br>  or so the story goes|`|B6r56Nr7aa	It's a custom in which for 40 days we abstain from meat on Fridays (fasting), work on bad qualities even harder, and pray more. <br>  <br>  Matthew Chapter 6|`|93galWG1aa	Catholics have lent yes, It's about a time of reflection on where we are going in life are we on the right path, are we doing |God's will, a time to walk with Christ in contemplation, a time to put ashes on our heads to remember we are but dust, and a time to seek forgiveness of our sins.<br>  we give up something because Jesus fasted 40 days in the desert, this is our way of following his example<br>  It starts today Ash Wednesday and ends at easter.

kdvy8Woqaa	Hispanic refers to Spanish speaking people no matter what background.  Latino basically refers to a person from Latin America or who has background that originates from Latin America.    Hispanic and Latino are not mutually exclusive.  For example, Brazilians are Latino because Brazil is a part of Latin America but they are not Hispanic because they do not speak Spanish, they speak Portuguese.    edit: @Yes We Can(below me)---People from Spain are Hispanic because they are Spanish speaking people. Being Hispanic has nothing to do with the fact that racially they are white.|`|hkvWDU3xaa	Ok people from Spain are not hispanic. They are Spanish.

I told you I loved your outlook,  I hope that is me some day! I guess we have to meet them over again at different stages?  My beautiful 5lb12oz is now 11 and 120lbs! and very full of himself!  It has been a bit of an uphill battle lately.. I'm  looking for the silver lining!  There is still hope, My 5 year old said he wishes he could stay 5 for ever, so he could stay with me!|`|o6MQWMo5aa	If when the phone rings and a quiet voice says " Daaaad."They are daughters.|`|80lWqRFiaa	Well, my oldest is 34 and the youngest is 12, and we have 6 grandkids, how did that happen I wonder every day.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I agree with wise man, I am ok with who I am until I look in a mirror and actually am shocked. I see my Mothers face not mine, and wonder when did that happen.  I used to look 15 years younger than I was and now, 15 years older since my health dumped on me.  My kids as grandparents has surprised me in ways I can't explain, my son David is a grandpa, my daughter has 4 grand babies.  OMG where has the time gone?|`|XEbrGfZuaa	My children are 43 and 45. We never hear from our son, even after  locating him after a silence of 18 or so years. He chose to become  who he is, and doesn't need his birth family. Only the members of  his currant JW family and friends. Luckily our oldest grandson had  the stubborness to not remain a follower,and is now in the service  and married with a stepson.      Our daughter is self absorbed in herself and family. She will call  about once a month to see how my husband is doing. And she lives  on the other side of town. Distance seems to be the key at staying  in contact with one, and not overdoing it. And distance is the rule   with our son as well. But for different reasons. Perhaps, it pays to have  a large family so you can actually have a normal relationship with one  or two children and grandchildren as well. Either that, or making sure  you don't have children in the first place. The pain from being hurt  never slackens. So I try to not think of them too often.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I am shocked and amazed that I could have daughters 38 and 42 when just yesterday they were 2 and 5 and I was only 25.

We're such  good friends now.  I'm sure they used to hate me, in their teen years. It was a constant battle, and I made many mistakes. Now that they are all married, and have children, they've told me that I did a wonderful job. I think they're just being kind. And, if that's the case, then that's good too.  They really are nice people. They've got nice friends, and they seem very happy.  How much more could anyone ask?
G4vFjh0yaa	After all his years in the organization the man nodded and blinked a gesture of recognition to the President of The United States on a day of great celebration, and after having been engaged in eye to eye contact with the man.  He not only deserves his position back but an apology.

What a price to pay for respecting the President's acknowledgment!!!  That's going a little too far!!!|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	I don't think it is because the guy winked and waved at the President. I think it is because the Pipes and Drums, would cover up the sound of a gunshot.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Bit much|`|tSlMSY9Qaa	I am probably going to be in the minority on this but I think he should have been suspended. He was suspended from the team and not from his job. Yes, 6 months is harsh though. My reasoning is that he never should have been looking at the President. He should have been looking straight ahead. That is his job. Also, everyone was warned prior to the event to not wave. He did it anyways. Maybe he had other infractions which caused the 6 month suspension. We don't know the whole story.|`|UllYFJgjaa	I did hear about that. I sure would wave, wink and nod at the President especially if he did it first......it's sad that you can't do something nice without getting kicked in the teeth.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	Obama should speak up in this man's defense(if he hasn't, I'm not familiar with this incident).|`|AA10181795	Was he waving a gun?

I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of 'Ali, 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of 'Abbas.

If you think Shia's aren't Muslims, you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Your questions sounds rather ignorant, even by Quranic standards. It's like asking "How dare non-Muslims not worship Allah?"    Giving you the benefit of the doubt, they have a different definition of 'Ahli bayt'. And they often point to a Sunni hadith that says Muhammad only allowed certain family members to 'come under the cloak', if I recall correctly.  They find it convincing. You don't. So we have no option but to go back to the golden words of the Quran. To you your religion and to them theirs.    But then the purpose of this question is to attack, not to converse.    Edit:    I don't want to sound impartial. I don't mind if I sound impartial or not. You may want to stop Ad hominem attacks and mind the content. Also, your attempts at humour are painfully terrible.  Remind me of the old user "Love from Iran" who was equally terrible at this.  Still, I haven't come across any anti-Sunni attacks by Shias yet. I'm not on that much.|`|MhbEQoJYaa	Sahih Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 316    Narrated Anas:    A banquet of bread and meat was held on the occasion of the marriage of the Prophet to Zainab bint Jahsh. I was sent to invite the people (to the banquet), and so the people started coming (in groups). They would eat and then leave. Another batch would come, eat and leave. So I kept on inviting the people till I found nobody to invite.    Then I said, O Allahs Prophet! I do not find anybody to invite.    He (the Prophet) said, Carry away the remaining food. Then a batch of three persons stayed in the house chatting. The Prophet left and went towards the dwelling place of Aisha and said, Peace and Allahs Mercy be on you, Ya Ahlel Bayt (O the people of the house)!    She replied, Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you too. How did you find your wife? May Allah bless you.    Then he went to the dwelling places of all his other wives and said to them the same as he said to Aisha and they said to him the same as Aisha had said to him.

Tranquility then descends and our hearts become soft. To get optimum benefit, remind yourself that Allah is speaking to you. People are described in different categories in the Quran; think of which one you find yourself in.   Realize the greatness of Allah. Everything is under His control. There are signs in everything we see that points us to His greatness. Everything happens according to His permission. Allah keeps track and looks after everything, even a black ant on a black rock on a black moonless night.   Make an effort to gain knowledge, for at least the basic things in daily life e.g. how to make wudu properly. Know the meanings behind Allah's names and attributes. People who have taqwa are those who have knowledge.   Attend gatherings where Allah is remembered. In such gatherings we are surrounded by angels.   We have to increase our good deeds. One good deed leads to another good deed. Allah will make the way easy for someone who gives charity and also make it easy for him or her to do good deeds. Good deeds must be done continuously, not in spurts.   We must fear the miserable end to our lives; the remembrance of death is the destroyer of pleasures.   Remember the different levels of akhirah, for instance when we are put in our graves, when we are judged, whether we will be in paradise or hell.   Make dua, realize that we need Allah. Be humble. Don't covet material things in this life.   Our love for Subhana Wa Ta'Ala must be shown in actions. We must hope Allah will accept our prayers, and be in constant fear that we do wrong. At night before going to sleep, we must think about what good we did during that day.   Realize the effects of sins and disobedience- one's imaan is increased with good deeds and our imaan is decreased by bad deeds. Everything that happens is because Allah wanted it. When calamity befalls us- it is also from Allah. It is a direct result of our disobedience to Allah.

Sure they aren't the most expensive but they are still pretty!  As for the tablecloth, maybe a friend has one you can borrow?  or a plain white sheet could work too.      Otherwise, just do the candles without the roses, it will still be pretty and romantic.  Happy Valentines Day!|`|qrOuQudZaa	Just go to the happiest place on Earth: DOLLAR STORE!

If you take your classes online, well, yeah, that keeps you out of having to deal with social situations like peer pressure, bullies, problems with various social groups, but it also keeps you away from opportunities to meet people and make friends and stuff, do you have activities to go to outside the home?  Has your therapist ever met with you and your parents together, or do they just drop you off there to meet with her on your own?  It sounds like your therapist really needs to get them more involved if you're having that much trouble talking to them...<br>  I will tell you, it's going to be ok, don't do anything drastic, ok?  How do you get to your therapist, is it possible for you to call her for an emergency appointment?  Some antidepressants can have an adverse effect on young people, and you definitely need to tell your therapist that you feel suicidal.  You may need a change of meds.  If you really feel you can't hang in there until Tuesday, and your parents won't here you, here is a web site that posts suicide hotlines across the nation:<br>  <a href="http://suicidehotlines.com/" rel="nofollow">http://suicidehotlines.com/</a>  Good luck LTN, whenever you feel like reaching for a knife, try reaching for the phone instead, and try to remember that if you can make it through the day you will have another chance for things to get better tomorrow, but if you don't, you won't have that chance.  Hanging in another day to try again gives yourself another chance.<br>  Look at this, you've got 27 strangers so far rooting for you, and more to come, I bet, so if that many people who don't even know you come out to tell you to keep your chin up, then try to keep the faith that it's a hard world, but it's a good world...now if you can just get it out there to some folks in the real world....Good luck...|`|93galWG1aa	I hope you can see that soon enough you'll be married with kids and life will have so much meaning, you'll learn from the mistakes your parents have made and your children will have the benefit of your experience.<br>  Have you told your parent's how un happy you are?<br>  There is a growing sense of loss in the world it's teenage suicide, why do you think that is?<br>  It's written in the last days Love will grow cold in people because they will reject God.<br>  There's also 60 million abortions every year and even ones that survive are left to die.<br>  Satan knows his time is near up and is running rampant in the world destroying Hope Love and Charity the 3 virtues of God all to depress and drive people to despair you need to stand up and be strong, Get to know God and pray for grace to protect you against this feeling of dispair.<br>  God bless, there are people in the world praying for all God's children to be protected, Blessed Mary will help Call on Her.|`|AA11503457	Everything will be okay if you give it time.

It's a combination of the hormones, societal expectations and the medication you're taking.

I know that everything seems bleak right now, but there is ALWAYS light at the end of the tunnel.  I've been where you are, I can understand how you feel.

They're only worried about your future, but at the same time, they don't understand that it's IMPOSSIBLE to care about school when you feel this way.

This isn't even near the best time of our lives. It WILL get better. I was the same way awhile back. I've just learned to chill out and not worry so much. My grades? I don't care anything about them, and I've learned to deal with that fact. School? It isn't the end of everything if you don't pass some classes. School isn't for everyone. There's alternatives if you can't get into college. Navy/Military (personally that's what I'm going to do). As much as I want to make my folks happy by putting a good report card ont he fridge, it's not what makes ME happy. I'm not busting my a ss off for a few A's. Bah, I'm rambling. Point is: Don't worry. It will work out. Give it some time.|`|SflneyGEaa	Oh hun... I've been there. Just remember, you're parents don't know everything. They're only human too. Sometimes we have to go through crappy times so we'll really appreciate the good ones. My best friend and soul mate committed suicide 2 years ago. I was devastated. I felt like nothing would ever go right again. I even considered joining him, I missed him that much. Even though I cried a lot, a lot a lot, I slowly began to see the people around me again and remember that, even though he wasn't here to hold me at night, I was loved. I tried the antidepressants also. They worked, for a while, but I just felt empty inside, like I couldn't have emotions. I left those behind and started seeing a therapist. That helped too. Even though I miss him, I'm glad I didn't join him. I wouldn't have the wonderful man I'm engaged to now. He may not be my soul mate, but he loves me and I him. Like I said, sometimes we have to live through the bad to see the good. It will get better. Keep your chin up.|`|WjA46Qg6aa	It's gonna be alright. Hang in there.^_^<br>  <br>  As bad as it may seem, it's nothing to get crazy over. There's nothing more important than life in this universe. You need to fight it out. To live is to fight. lol. <br>  <br>  As for your grades, don't worry so much. People make mistakes. I was one of the top students at my high school, and yet during my first year at University I'm doing terrible. I messed up. But now I have the chance to make up for that, and I'm doing my best. You have to decide what you want out of your education, and what's preventing you from achieving that. If your dad or whoever gets mad, that'll only be a temporary thing. If you want to get the best out of your education, you have to stop whatever's preventing you from doing it, and you will do better. If not, maybe that's a discussion you can have with your dad or whoever. But whatever it is, it's certainly not something worth losing your life over. The bad times will pass.<br>  <br>  Well anyways hang in there! :D|`|esXp2ENEaa	Well let me first be the one to say that your not alone,i once felt that way and sometimes you just feel like you are the only one that feels like that and no one understands. Your parents do care they just dont know how to help you because if you have never felt that way how can you help. They care! There are a lot of people that care about you and alot that dont. Some times you will feel better and sometimes it will feel like it will never get better! But you know like when you get a cut when you are a kid and your parents tell you it will feel better soon and you think it will hurt forever and it goes away and you had already forgoten about it well thats how life is soon you feel better and you wont even notice the process so keep on truckin. you will feel better!|`|gTGuTfh0aa	Really try to think of the bright things in life > in the situation your in it's so hard trust me i know a lot of people who have had nervous breakdowns due to stress and deppression. You life is sacred. Really pray that you'll be helped in this time of need for God will help you ouit of this situation and guide your path. Just pray sincerely and he will answer and grades don't matter its mainly about your health.|`|mvxn2Bhvaa	Your situation sounds so familiar, guess cuz I've been through some of the same stuff...depression-wise and feeling suicidal.  Suicidal thoughts are something I've been struggling with for the past eight/nine years, and I'm actually, honestly happy to say I'm still alive :)  and even happier to say, that I'm happy where I'm at right now.  <br>  And I promise, no matter how bad it gets, if you hang in there, you're gonna get through--there'll come a day when you really are happy to be alive, and you'll be even happier knowing that you chose to live.  <br>  I know it's hard to imagine right now.<br>  The one thing that strikes me about your question/story is that you're panicking cuz you feel like killing yourself.  If you really wanted to die, you wouldn't be panicking--you'd be going and getting that knife.  Just simply asking for support on here proves that you don't want to die--whether you consciously know it or it's deep down, almost doesn't matter.  But once you discover that you truly do want to live, that you really do want to get through this, and you really do want to be happy again--you're on the road to recovery.  Simply making the decision that you won't kill yourself is the first step to getting strong enough to overcome this.  At least, it was for me.  And it's gonna be hard, but don't give up, because things have a way of working out, no matter how bad it gets.  <br>  I have to admit, that praying sometimes doesn't work for me--sometimes I feel completely alone, like maybe He's not there either.  But He is--Psalm 94:9 says, "Does He who implanted the ear not hear?  Does He who formed the eye not see?"  <br>  God does hear you, and He is listening.  He sees every tear you cry, and He knows every hurt in your heart, and He cares so much about you.  It's hard to find Him when everything and everyone feels so distant and you're lost in depression and pain, but there is a way out, I promise.  <br>  Just don't give up, there are so many people who love you.  You will get through this!
QIgrBrFdaa	Interesting! I was wondering the same thing really.<br>  I'm not sure exactly why, but i guess it's kind of a way to be fully involved, anyone can recite a few words at a bedside, but praying the way us Muslims do takes more concentration, dedication and involvement. It differentiates Muslims from non-Muslims in prayer. I think that the position when we are put our hands and heads to the ground (i forgot the term for it) is a sign to show that Allah is great and powerful and that you are kind of giving yourself up to Allah.<br>  <br>  The positions/motions of prayer are also beneficial medically...If you think about it, you're using alot of your joints/muscles etc especially doing this 5 times every day... a nice little workout without you even knowing :D lol. I heard that it's good to help arthritis too.<br>  Check this website out about how it helps our bodies...very interesting! <br>  <a href="http://uiforum.uaeforum.org/archive/index.php?t-7539.html" rel="nofollow">http://uiforum.uaeforum.org/archive/inde...</a><br>  <br>  Hmm i agree  hope - why bother answering if you're just going to be rude.|`|8lthg3OQaa	Wallahu alim, we do it because Allah swt has prescribed it for us first and foremost. Salah does have physical benefits and can effect much of the body on the inside and out, i have seen some stuff on youtube, but we do it because Allah swt has ordained it. It is a form of ibadah inshaAllah highly liked by Allah swt. "wa maa khalaqtal jinn wal ins illa liya abidun." "I did not create jinn and mankind but that they should worship (me) alone." The still standing allows for concentration, the sajda(prostration) is closet we can get to out lord inshaAllah, the bowing(ruku) is a form of worship. We could go on inshaAllah. We shouldnt worship Allah just to get into jannah or to be free from jahanam, illa (but) because he swt is worthy of being worshiped, his glory is unparalleled.|`|kDUBuBxnaa	Allah commanded the Muslims to.

Duh.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	I will talk about Sujood as I am sleepy and will edit 2mro Insha'Allah: <br>  <br>  The Sujood is done on a total of 7 body parts: The forehead (including the nose), the two palms, the two knees, and the two feet (toes)… All firm upon the ground till every bone and joint is fixed in place with peace and calm. <br>  <br>  He (saw) said, “The closest a servant ever is to His Lord, is when he is prostrating (in sujood), so make in it much duaa.” . <br>  <br>  <br>  Sujood is significant  since one can/is thanking the Creator, for preventing a crisis, for healing sickness and diseases, for eliminating a problem, a Muslim prostrates, makes Sujood, to Allah (swt). A Muslim thanks Allah (swt) daily and regularly. A Muslim's methods of thanks and appreciations could be the minimum, saying verbally: "Subhana Rabbil ah'lah (Praise be to Allah)," (swt) or the maximum, i.e. of prostrating to Allah. During prostration, a person glorifies Allah, exalts Him, praises Him, and surrenders to Him.|`|1ZVtTII8aa	I think it's to differentiate our way of praying to other religions way of praying and also to show we care enough to make the effort. :Pxx|`|Do6NfeACaa	"We got to pray just to make it today"-MC Hammer|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	we can't question that... it is his command<br>  <br>  in a prayer we ask for things, ask for forgiveness, praise Allah

Most White men go for Asian women because we're the most educated group in the world and are not as wild or slutty as the other women (not all of course). But then again, many are infatuated with us due to our cultural beliefs, morals and the way we value relationship.     Petite? I'm really not sure about that. I'm pretty tall and have curves, yet guys of every race hit on me ALL the time. In fact, a lot of the women in China and South Korea are very tall; average 5'7". So I really think this petite nonsense isn't true for some White guys.    As for anorexic, it's true. In Asian culture and society, women are suppose to be thin. For instance, an average weight American is consider fat in Asian standard.    P.S. Two things I realize from my personal experience is that many guys love the way Asian female's hair and skin look like. Weird, huh? It seems like when guys hit on me, they always compliment how beautiful my Asian hair is.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	I'm white and I don't find asians attractive at all.

GxQyvrv4aa	well, I am American and am certainly not stupid.<br>  I am sure you probably get loads of shows and movies from the United States so you know that at least we are smart enough to entertain other nations. As to where it originated from, it's the fact that we are under immense scrutiny because of our general popularity. We Americans also make fun of ourselves and our stupidity with shows like Family Guy and The Simpsons, thus others take advantage of the knowledge we offer about ourselves through television and movies. This doesn't mean we are all stupid. We invented many things, just like other Europeans, we have some of the best universities (like Europe). Perhaps it happens to every highly industrialized nation that the general public becomes lazy and feels no need to better themselves because everything is already good enough. As far as Americans being intrinsically stupid? That would be an ignorant assumption, who is anybody to measure intelligence without a biased operational measure??<br>  Another thing, do you wear blue jeans, do you have a refrigerator, do you have a microwave? do you listen to rock and roll?<br>  <br>  These are all American inventions. I am not saying we are all smart or that the world owes us something. On the contrary other nations have invented great things, but please...do give us Americans a break.|`|ncdTxID9aa	It's not that we aren't smart, it's how important education is to you or your family. Schools from other countries ( who get WAY less funding) are just better at teaching, schools resulting with smarter students. Students aged 15 years old from 40 different countries took the exact same tests, and America placed 25th out of 40. It's not that Americans are dumb, it's just that other countries tend to take education way more serious. But again many Americans aren't "dumb"  lol|`|yUG7OUblaa	they aren't stupid.just miss informed.only told what they need to know.i live in Northern ireland an it funny when you see American people visiting.they got the american flag on them.in their clothes.looking around like wow i cant believe this country exist.americans watch lot's of tv.an if all your seeing is war torn country's an that america is the best country in the world an no other is better.an that they are always being attacked an that their violence every were so never leave your house during the night time stay in an watch tv.an we will entertain you.i was their a while back an i was getting ask if i had the Internet if id heard this song seen this movie if we had this or that.i was like stop, to be honest with you Northern ireland is a little more advance than america.we don't rid horses to get around.we have everything that you have.an they were like wow really.just in schools we learn about the world.an the place we lived in.so their not stupid just naive.kept miss informed an afraid of the outside world.so maybe it started when tv started getting bigger.an more an more bull crap start showing.an its happening in the uk too.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	Were a bit behind other western democracies when it comes to our social policies.

syIp6d2Naa	Sometimes people get in a hurry and their fingers will hit the wrong key so it creates a miss-spelled word. Having a spell checker handy and using it is only shows your consideration to others. Using proper grammar is nice also. I do understand english is not the first language for many and the fact they are using it to their best abilities speaks well of them. They will learn better if those of us that has english as our first language uses it in the proper way. As far as being the Yahoo police, some people are less tolerant of questions that are offensive to them or they perceive it might be offensive to others, therefore they are quick to act. Sometimes we need to be a bit slower reporting things. I have only reported two questions the whole time I have been on here one was way to prejudice the other a slam on someones religion. "Now I Wasn't Asked", (and I'm not being hateful) but, just to help you in the sentence "When no one ask them to" the word ask should be plural as "asks" if your using it in the present. Presented in the past-tense  it should be "asked". the punctuation needed is a period at the end of the sentence.  Don't get mad, can't you see the humor in worrying about this?|`|m1V5ws73aa	You're under arrest!|`|AA11296212	I was deputized last night...tron.quito, you forgot to capitalize "english"...just remember, people make mistakes.|`|jbDTsZyBaa	Nothing better to do I suppose.

If someone is expecting ME to take MY TIME to answer THEIR question.. then they can at LEAST RESPECT  ME ENOUGH to write it in a version of english that is generally understandable by most people who speak english.    I should not have to TRY TO UNDERSTAND their posting.. because THEY CAN'T SPELL or WRITE AN INTELLIGENT SENTENCE... that is NOT MY FAULT that THEY CAN'T LEARN HOW TO SPELL.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	Probably the only place that little wimps can have power.

It provided national conservation work primarily for young unmarried men. Recruits lived in semi-military work camps and received $30 a month as well as food and medical care. Projects included planting trees, building flood barriers, fighting forest fires, and maintaining forest roads and trails. It employed a total of 3 million men during its existence.  With modifications,  it could still work today.

44eaCT4Zaa	I teach my children my experiences.  I have experienced the baptist, catholic and jehovah witness type religions.  I have found that I am truly an atheist - however my husband (not my childrens father) is a jehovah witness.  My children see the differences between the two beliefs.  They know I support them in any belief they have even if it differs from mine, just as I support my husband and his belief that differs from mine.  It really bothers me when children are raised to believe as their parents instead of given a free will to choose for themselves.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	I've always answered their questions honestly.  That's what good parents do.  And of course they've asked about religion and church and all that.  And of course my replies always reflected reality...|`|SoY4IiYBaa	I let them figure it out...I only share my opinion when they ask for it...|`|AA11058044	I don't talk with my kids about anything.  They never laugh at my jokes, and can barely string an entire sentence together.  It's like they're retarded or something.<br>  <br>  Of course, the fact that I don't actually have any kids might have something to do with it.<br>  <br>  Which is why I compensate by finding Christian kids, and telling them that there's no god.|`|4sUek7ugaa	I taught my kids that people believe different things.  I talked about what I believe and what various other friends and relatives believe. They've managed to sort things out for themselves.|`|NrzxtivLaa	I don't have kids to teach.....if I did, I'd teach them critical thinking skills and let them choose their own beliefs|`|klfvmIEXaa	we sent are children to sunday school and let them make their own minds up|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Do you teach your children that there's no Santa?<br>  <br>  Being an atheist is really, really simple. There's no god. Life continues. So what's there to say, really? Would you sit down and lay out the reasons why there's no Santa? Of course not. It's a given to any reasonable human being.<br>  <br>  Most people who are not raised in a religion won't believe in god, because the only way to make someone believe in god is to brainwash them to do so. So there's no need to "teach" anything. If the kid asks, tell them. But otherwise, what's there to say?<br>  <br>  There's always a chance that they'll grow up to be religious, no matter what you raise them with. They are independent human beings.|`|AA11946554	My dad tried to take my kid to some brainwashing Bible class...I rolled my eyes until my kid came home with this bs document that was FULL of verses and statements that basically said he was nothing 'but for the glory of God'. Have you read the horrendous bs that ****** pulls in the OT?! 'Glory of God' my eye!<br>  So, I tried calmly to point out opposing verses. He went a few more times, I kept pointing out contradicting verses...He quit going and tried to read that insanely boring book himself but he's since given up on it. I just got a DVD in the mail that's an instructional course on the Greek myths. We'll be studying that together.<br>  I suggest exposing your child to that and other religions....there is no one more susceptible to their trap than those who are ignorant to their dogma. When your kid is older, I would suggest a comparative religion class. You might like taking one, too.|`|shcnDVHsaa	No. Buy him a buch of books simplified for children about A LOT of religions.

Just because I'm an atheist doesn't mean they have to be. They can believe whatever they want if it makes them feel better.|`|FKN8Rmu6aa	A good parent supplies the child with guidance and truthful answers. When one of my children is ready for that topic, I teach them what I believe but encourage them to use their brain, sort through the facts and evidence based on logic and reason. Guidance is the key. To many so called parents leave these questions and many others unanswered. The kids then go out to find answers on their own from some punk or morons on the street. There is no factual evidence for God or religion. Many people are disturbed with this mental sickness. Fairy tales like leprechauns,tooth fairies and goblins are just the same as Jesus Christs,immaculate conceptions or heaven and hell. They are not real and unnecessary for a thinking modern person.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	I would do the same thing my parents did to me:  Explain that the belief in god is a large part of life for many people and teach them about different religions.  Then I would explain to they why I don't believe in god and let them choose for themself.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	I tell them, it's their call. I just present the objective parts about religion and its history.|`|NlnM6diMaa	Yes I tell my son that I'm an atheist and answer any questions he has but try to do it on a level he can understand.|`|bRBZ5KX3aa	my children are nonexistent so i dont teach them much really|`|LUiiAlsJaa	of course, i dont want my kids involved in the occult

I've included a link of a company that is fairly reputable if you want to purchase a set.<br>  <br>  For specific workings to draw love to someone (without focusing on anyone specific) - go with a bind rune.

stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

WuhIoS1laa	What do you normally do for Easter? I have no idea about you, but regardless of the holiday my family either plays games, talk in the kitchen, watches movies or go shopping. <br>  <br>  If there is a reason for all this stiff tension, might as well air it out and ask. I mean if you don't like them, don't know the reason why, and are about to quit them anyway, whatcha got to lose? <br>  <br>  I agree with the Start A New Tradition theory. My family doesn't really do Easter as a big family get together, they way we do other holidays, so I'm not sure what all you might do.<br>  <br>  Why not hold Easter at your own house? Have your other family, and friends over and do what you want to do. For giggles, invite them! It might have nothing to do with you and your cousins might welcome the change and unwind a little.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	If you don't enjoy your family's company, you shouldn't feel obligated to go every year like you have been becuase it's become a tradition.

You don't have to make excuses or explain yourselves, you're adults. Call up your aunt and tell her you won't be coming. Then start doing it every year around Easter time. By the description you gave, nobody is going to miss you and everyone will probably have a better time.<br>  Enjoy your holiday!|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Don't go.  I have the same thing with some relatives.  I often go way out of my way to see them, each time stupidly thinking that things will change and they'll appreciate the fact that I've come out.  They don't.  Plus they act as if it's my fault that I'm not out more often.<br>  <br>  The one problem I do have is that my sister is in their town, so since I'm there, I can't really avoid them, so I see them anyway.  I've just learnt not to take them so seriously.<br>  <br>  Your situation seems more clear-cut.  Just don't go.  They might even be more relaxed about it if you do so.
CQz8dMzFaa	The long pilgrimage is called the hajj, which is mandatory for every Muslim, and it must be done regardless of health or personal problems. The shorter version is known as the Umrah, which is not compulsory.   If a person is seriously ill, its best to wait until they are better. I've heard that the hajj can be done on behalf of someone who is too ill to ever go(like old, bedridden ppl ), but I'm not too sure on the validiy of that.  A person needs money to go for the pilgrimage, to pay for any expenses, and must settle all debts before leaving. Women need to take along a male companion, (for the purposes of protection I guess).  There are too many verses, I can cite a few, but its best you consult the Quran itself, or websites:    [2:196] 'You shall observe the complete rites of Hajj and`Umrah for GOD. If you are prevented, you shall send an offering, and do not resume cutting your hair until your offering has reached its destination. If you are ill, or suffering a head injury (and you must cut your hair), you shall expiate by fasting, or giving to charity, or some other form of worship. During the normal Hajj, if you break the state of Ihraam (sanctity) between `Umrah and Hajj, you shall expiate by offering an animal sacrifice. If you cannot afford it, you shall fast three days during Hajj and seven when you return home - this completes ten - provided you do not live at the Sacred Masjid. You shall observe GOD, and know that GOD is strict in enforcing retribution.'    [2:197] 'Hajj shall be observed in the specified months(Zul-Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, and Rabi). Whoever sets out to observe Hajj shall refrain from sexual intercourse, misconduct, and arguments throughout Hajj. Whatever good you do, GOD is fully aware thereof. As you prepare your provisions for the journey, the best provision is righteousness. You shall observe Me, O you who possess intelligence.'|`|3E2EQH12aa	a married daughter? what??? u shouldnt have any debt but having a married daughter or a sick wife that doesnt make any sense..anyone can go to hajj at any age even if they have No daughter or wife|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	you need a passport and a visa for saudi

But before asking her if she wants to stay with you, dump the girlfriend. If you really are in love with your girlfriend, tell your wife and file for divorce. But make sure your girlfriend knows that you have a wife first. (Does she know?)  After you do that, its pretty simple.

But if not than think about it this way, your wife married you because she loves you, she made a commitment to you. YOU made a commitment to HER. If you choose your girlfriend, how do you know you're going to love her in ten years? How do you know SHE'S going to love YOU in ten years?

If you doubt counseling will resolve your marriage issues, it is time to let her mend, heal and move on. Otherwise you are postponing the agony for this poor woman. You are also not being fair to the girlfriend, knowing she will always be the " Other woman".   Valentines day will never be the same :(|`|YEGDdBgkaa	Neither.

Does that mean his dad was half gay, but that his grand-father was full-blooded gay?  He's likely bi-sexual.  I know what you mean, I just find the wording funny.

Ask him and confirm that he does play around with guys at times.<br>  <br>  If he says yes, just let him know that you have thought about it at times, but the opportunity never came up, but you would if you ever had the chance.<br>  <br>  If he's interested at all, he should realize that you are open to the two of you playing around.

dzqxQmpFaa	St. Gabriella<br>  Feastday: September 29<br>  Patron Communications workers<br>  <br>  <br>  Gabriella is the feminine form of Gabriel. Angels are spirits without bodies, who possess superior intelligence, gigantic strength, and surpassing holiness. They enjoy an intimate relationship to God as His special adopted children, contemplating, loving, and praising Him in heaven. Some of them are frequently sent as messengers to men from on high. The name Gabriel means "man of God," or "God has shown himself mighty." It appears first in the prophesies of Daniel in the Old Testament. The angel announced to Daniel the prophecy of the seventy weeks. His name also occurs in the apocryphal book of Henoch. He was the angel who appeared to Zachariah to announce the birth of St. John the Baptizer. Finally, he announced to Mary that she would bear a Son Who would be conceived of the Holy Spirit, Son of the Most High, and Saviour of the world. The feast day is September 29th. St. Gabriel is the patron of communications workers.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Sept. 29  Gabriela,Gabriella, Gabrielle, Briel <br>  <br>  "God's strength" <br>  <br>  God had given us archangels to assist us during our pilgrimage on earth.

emvIYyufaa	Not really, I think. I know that I am japanese american, with english being my first language so I don't know japanese well and I dress differently, more like americans and when around japanese people from japan, I have been stared at, thought of as stupid or retarded because I can't speak japanese that well, and been talked about behind my back. I think japanese are more critical of fellow japanese people than of obvious foreigners.    However, I can't really say that white girls are any better in general. I've been teased and discriminated against by white girls because I don't look like them and/or they assume things about me because of my looks. There are women that are too critical in all races just like there are nice women in all races as well. Also, if you happen to fall into the otaku look, I do know that in Japan, that is considered a horrible look, while in america, it's not as big a deal.    I'll just say don't base all your romantic decisions based on race. The longer you stay in America, the more people you'll meet, good and bad.|`|yS9a9jk5aa	whites and asians get along....too well.|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	LMAO no white girls arent nicer...well maybe because ur japanese idk.

AA10636233	It means you are aware of some major differences in the way you have been raised in comparison to the people raised in this new country. For example, many children from other parts of the world are shocked at the way american children behave disrestectfully toward their parents and other elders. Another major difference is their eating habits, children I have met from the middle east are shocked at the way american children refuse to eat certain foods(like peas or broccoli lol). In their culture, food is a gift, and should be accepted in that spirit. They wouldn't dream of turning down a meal just because they don't enjoy the taste of some part of it, they are just happy to have food to eat. One more major difference would be attire/physical appearance. The children from most of those other countries aren't as into fashion and coolness as american kids are. They dress more for comfort and necessity than style. Of course, women want pretty clothes, but they bear in mind that the outfit they choose will have to be practical too. If you can't do laundry or pull feathers from a chicken while wearing it, then why would you want it? In the U.S., culturally you know that men have underarm hair, and women do not, right? Well in the middle east, Men often shave their underarms to prevent odor, and they don't use deodorant either, but they do us a certain type of crystal that they rub on their skin. It prevents bacterial growth, and helps prevent body odor. Here in the states, most men would be laughed out of the locker room if they shaved their pits lol!

READ THE BOOK!
nQvcqVkNaa	Yhshua/Jesus said that there would be an abundance of false 'christians' calling him "lord, lord" but that a true Christian is one who does the will of his Almighty God YHWH/Jehovah. See Matthew 7:21-23 for that statement and then see Deuteronomy 18:10-13 and 2 Chronicles 33:6 to understand the will of Christ's Almighty Father regarding foretelling the future as horoscopes attempt to do.|`|BRNNVcMOaa	as a Christian i put my faith in the one that created the stars. only through God can you be a true prophet if God has given you the ability to see the future through means such as the stars then it is fine but horoscopes today mean nothing it is a parlor trick if you will. ALL THINGS are possible with God and only He can give you true wisdom.<br>  Note:over the years the months and days have changed so many times that we really don't know which sign really belongs where anymore. not a good way to read your future when everything is so misplaced.|`|SUBKGSQNaa	No, it's called "divination". It's trying to find out about your future instead of simply trusting in God.<br>  If you are not particularly interested in the predictions but like the astrological signs,there is something similar which IS compatible with Christianity,and that is the Enneagram. This divides people into 9 personality types and studies their characteristics. It is accepted by Christians and by the catholic church in particular.|`|WZsP5Xcbaa	Astrology is not a part of what it means to be a Christian.  God wants you to find your identity as a child of God in Him, not in some warped perception of the stars.|`|47GdgGKIaa	haha im a christian and i look at horoscopes... but its a part of wtichcraft... but i like the "evil" so,,, yeah|`|TzY9vkinaa	it's part of witchcraft|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Why would you even believe in horoscopes?

Remain vigilant_ alas, me lad, there is no cure.|`|hCsAHDjNaa	I honestly cannot tell if this is supposed to be a sexual metaphor or not, or at least the part about hitting balls with sticks into holes. Like I'm sorry if my mind just went to a dirty place or something...<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's what's wrong with your friend: he's Scottish. You obviously know that and I really don't see the point in this question. Unless of course that sexual reference was intended.|`|4HUZJdVNaa	If he is Scottish and wears a kilt there is nothing wrong with him|`|B0GujA9Aaa	Is your friend Scottish? Because if he is then he is probably trying to get in touch with his roots. <br>  <br>  If he's not Scottish then he:<br>  <br>  Might be drunk or high?<br>  <br>  Is starting a new fashion trend and game?

I would prefer that you took whatever you were planning to spend on me and donate it to a soup kitchen, the Salvation Army, or some other worthy organization that helps folk in true NEED.

If in the future you reject the JW beliefs and refuse to raise your children as JW's, you will be cut off from all JW's and in the case of divorce would mean your husband would not associate with you. If your children reject JW beliefs, your husband would refuse to associate with them also. Not a good idea.<br>  <br>  edit: here are some facts about JW's and how they treat those who leave the faith that you should be aware of before you marry one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jwfacts.com/index_files/disfellowship.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jwfacts.com/index_files/disfe...</a>|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No I don't think so.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	No, you will be unevenly yoked.

Lesbian porn shows women like you getting it on, so it may appeal more to you for that reason.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	yes

AA10810835	I am a werewolf, but I don't know if 'fully fledged' is the right term for what I am.<br>  I have been living for so long, I can't even remember my age (yes, I can suffer from memory loss over long periods of time, just as well really).<br>  I am a spiritual werewolf, but anybody would think I was human, I do change into a wolf-hybrid (you can call me a monster at that point) when I'm in a difficult situation, where it is needed, and I take liberty to change on the full moon (just for fun usually), but its not some mandatory trigger.<br>  Being a spiritual werewolf means I am a spirit who turns into a werewolf, in my case, I interact with physical bodies, I emulate my self-spiritually controlled body so well I sometimes forget I am not alive, the term given to our kind is a half-life, but that's the same for any earthbound spirit really, but I am part-alive, and part-dead.<br>  I have lived since the Assyrian age (from what I remember), and lived in Scythia and for Greece for much of my life.<br>  I have died a few times between, and my current age is 105 (pretty impressive, heh?) still looking young, I suppose its all the carnal-?thereal transmogrification I do when I turn into a werewolf.<br>  I have only been a werewolf (known by documentation I left) in the lifetimes since slightly before the Ancient Greek period.<br>  I am a spiritual descendant to my other lifetimes before my current one, and still keep my own curse to be a werewolf.<br>  I am also a very powerful spirit, and more specifically, a demon (because I take away other spirits' energy, to make myself stronger), yes I am an evil spirit, but I am not twisted, I do what I want, I am a free spirit, I have never left Earth to my knowledge.<br>  The amount of spiritual energy I have gives me the power of becoming a therianthrope, etc, I have to say, my mind in human self, cannot take the information of rhythmical algorithm and/or spell. So I just use my energy to turn into a werewolf when I want, its easier. I believe the others can change when they feel like it, but most of them leave this boring planet, leaving me to it.<br>  I hope to rule the world some day, but may be never.<br>  Thanks for the anonymous interview.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Im not, but I think they are hot, was just checking to see who was.|`|xOcfOy1vaa	i am not one but i know one. here is his myspace. check it out. <br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=112478406" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a>|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	It's called porphyria.

AA11172918	Here's what I would do, and the good news is that it's inexpensive.    I would go to CropMom at http://www.cropmom.com, and upload a photo of the two of us. I would create a digital scrapbook layout using that photos and CropMom's graphics, and maybe even add some of my own text.    Then, I  would purchase the high-resolution JPEG file of the layout (it's under $2). From here, I would have the layout printed on a spiral lined notebook at Shutterfly or Snapfish. It's not that expensive but looks professionally done. He'll be impressed. If you don't want to give him a blank notebook with the layout on the cover, you can use the layout on a coffee mug or a travel mug. But I think the blank noteobook is the best because he could use it as a sketchbook for his anime.|`|FplTPoAyaa	I think a scrapbook would be a great idea.  Using cut-outs from magazines, pictures of you together, stuff like that.  Good luck !|`|rqlLTEKzaa	If he's overly loving.. and a little corny...  then making him a scrapbook type thing would be awesome!!    Time and time again i've seen people make boyfriends scrapbooks. And don't worry about the age difference.. my boyfriend is 2 years older than me and it's never mattered.    Just make like a scrapbook of what you both love together.. what he loves.. what the relationship means to you.. anything that u relate to him.. it will show him how important u are to him.. and its not that expensive...    And you could then get him something silly like his favorite chocolate.. or something you both love.. as long as there is ltos of thought he wont care.|`|d3pDQ7Wwaa	Scrapbook is a great idea|`|s827R4ataa	first of all the age doesnt rly matter...im a sophmore and my bf is a junior but he rly should b a senior and no1 rly cares and my friend is a junior and he dated a freshmen and no1 cared then either. but a scrapbook is a great idea if u dont have much money to spend and you could put some of the songs in it and some pictures and also maybe some random things you like about him. you could also get maybe a cute mug that says i love u on it and put some hershey kisses in it|`|rI664Kybaa	Make a personalized pictured of the two of you, and then put it in a frame.    You could make a cool one with the site http://www.mirbit.com    If you go into the 'dragz' section, you can upload a photo (would be good to use one of the two of you) and then add stuff to it such as decorative frames (lots of good V-day heart ones), graphical items and text..and then it lets you turn it into a printable greeting card, email it, or save it to you computer (great for uploading to Facebook, etc.)    The sites free and really easy to use--and the personal touch always means so much more!
DZCFD0p2aa	get him a car, a PS3 or a 52" TV. If you can't afford any of those, then get him a 3some    EDIT: you already done the 3some? Awesome. If you want something to wrap, then why not wrap your entire body with red velvet ribbon. Only cover the intimate parts and wear a coat over it. Then when you take it off, all he has to do it pull on the part you ties the bow and everything else will fall off.|`|4L0aB1Zraa	uhm... probably the best thing is free lol it includes your mouth and makin him extremely happy... sorry i know its crude but it makes any guy happy... or a videogame if hes into that stuff...
17orTrcRaa	I think her co-workers would still be blown away, those are gorgeous bouquets, I like them both.  They are like bridal bouquets, so that makes them even more romantic.  Good idea!  Something new rather than the traditional vase of red roses shows that you have put more thought into the gift.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	Why not do both? Send her roses at work earlier in the day and then show up at her work later, give her the purple rose hand bouquet and then take her out to lunch.  On Sat cook her breakfast and be romantic.|`|Hrgp1oC5aa	Personally...I like the purple ones.|`|dNUnG9ITaa	the second one is very pretty but I would say the hand bouquets are definitely more for weddings.  Get her a nice arrangement in a vase or something easy to put on her desk.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	I personally like the second one best. It is not that I don't like the purple roses (beautiful), but I don't like the filler babies breath that is with it. Still, I do like red roses too and the others mixed in the second bouquet are just sooo beautiful and really do make this a nice, romantic alternative to the usual dozen red roses. Regardless, yes she will love getting these at work. Good job! Oh, I just noticed the part about the hand bouquet. She will need a vase for whatever you get. I prefer a simple clear one that she can reuse.

5frOVAgSaa	most of my dreams come out to be true. i usually keep them to myself unless i see it right to discuss with someone else. like once i saw a friend in trouble, and about a few month later something invoked me that i must tell her about it. she was going somewhere the next day and i told her that be really really careful tomorrow and i told her about the dream (i wont go into the details of it). she thought i was overreacting and that everything would be okay but instead she fell seriously ill the very next day because of food poisoning.    there have been other dreams that i had, those that came true. most of them are sad (in fact i dont remember a good one coming true). while there are other dreams that just let me know of something, not that it mattered much but it still is amusing. like i had a vague dream about the empty house that is in our neighbourhoood... that someone got killed there and they are leaving. the next day i inquired someone why doesn't anyone live in that house and it turned out that someone was actually killed and later the family left the place.|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Dreams- No    Nightmares- Yes|`|YHE6JTxvaa	I have had dreams that have come  true, but I don't know what it means.

Like once I dreamt that I looked up at the sky and the clouds were moving super fast, then a few months later when I was on the plane I looked out the window and I saw exactly what I saw in the dream. When things come true they tend to be like that. I'm sure I have had some that came true though, but I can't remember them. There's some I wish came true, but they don't :(     But most don't, coz my dreams are STRANGE. Like tortoises trying to convince me that I'm not dreaming, or those naked ones I HATE those. Except I don't wake up after that. I have to find my way home - naked :O They're so horrible! lol.     But a lot of things that I can remember lately recurring in my dreams is me being in a plane going somewhere nice, except I'm terrified in the dream, like of the height for some reason. I DO really want to go on holiday and I haven't really gone anywhere for like 6 years, so I'm hoping that means I'll have the money this year to go on holday inshallah lol.|`|UxlL89rHaa	Many of my Dreams come true, some even years later.|`|Mw7v9A64aa	Well once I had a dream where ma bezz matez Ryan and Cloe went wiv me to da cinemaa and den it came true!

CCf6Y7DIaa	take japanese; you're more interested in it! -also, it's harder, since it's totally foreign, and harder efforts usually garner better rewards.    it is very easy for mainland chinese who only know han-yu (mandarin) to understand cantonese and i'm sure you can easily pick up the national language in turn. once you get into college, consider taking an advanced chinese course there. in my experience, college foreign language courses >>>>>> high school courses; they go far more in depth, and the professors are usually far less buggered about things like homework or getting the teacher's exact chosen answer when two or three equally appropriate answers exist (ie: the wrong teacher can really fubar your grades -even if your comprehension and delivery are otherwise excellent-, especially since chinese teachers usually don't give extra credit).    just one tip: if you decide to take an advanced chinese course in college, make sure you get a professor who is actually a college professor and not a high school teacher moonlighting in college. it makes a HUGE difference in what is taught as well as well as the teaching style of the professor. -trust me, you don't want the high school professor; you want the real, college level professor who will give you the most information, and the most useful information, while being non-condescending and lenient about things such as homework. you will have a far better time -and also learn far more- with a college professor accustomed to dealing with the interests of working adults.    happy language mastering!|`|a6JZjRG1aa	Chinese...|`|rVQnoOMbaa	Mandarin Chinese for sure - because it's not widely studied here, it's more desirable.|`|0PVp8Okoaa	Hmm I took japanese for two years, but just dropped it for this year. I actually like japanese, but i dropped it cause i didn't like how the teacher taught it haha.    I actually kind of regret it now but oh well. I think you should take Japanese at school, and in your spare time you could teach yourself Mandarin cause it's easy.     At school your teachers should have resources that can help you with Japanese. The thing with japanese and Chinese is that Japanese has more than one alphabet writing language, and there's one called 'kanji' and it's from Chinese characters, so japanese could help you learn mandarin or vice versa. I speak Cantonese too hehe.  I know for certain that where I live you can learn mandarin outside of school, but its rare to find somewhere to learn japanese outside of school.    Do your parents know Mandarin? You could ask them to help you!|`|L8hU0sZbaa	japanese!!!!!!!!!  its the best you could choose|`|LMQ9bgK4aa	maybe chinese ,i suggest.

AA12369527	This is not a silly question at all.  In fact, I congratulate you on your observtion.  British pronunciation is very different from American pronunciation...you already know that.  To further complicate matters, even in the UK, pronunciation differs from one place to another.  The standard, therefore, is taken as the BBC English.  Specifically to your questions....Leisure in British English is pronounced the way Lennon does.  In American English it is pronounced both in the manner that Lennon does and the way you say it.  Here, I must mention that in both British and American English, many words have more than one acceptable form of pronunciation.  One of these is preferred over all others, but all are correct and in usage.  Moving on to Migraine, the "preferred" British pronunciation is Meegrein.  The second pronunciation is Maigrein and the third accepted pronunciation is Migrein (shorter e).  The same word, however, has only one accepted pronunciation in American English and that is Maigrain.  (notice my final "ain" for American English and "ein" for British English).  There is a pronunciation dictionary by Daniel Jones that gives all these nuances.  It is indispensible for broadcasters (or at least I believe it is).  If languages interest you, you should buy this dictionary.|`|f46eba9a44febf54f21dfe556dc25040aa	yes , the pronounciation is the british type of english,  and american english is somewhat  different , ,  yes the correct pronounciation is MY-graine.  bye!!!|`|51b12a8c8942afaac14b7c9668186be0aa	I use the Lennon style pronounciation.|`|AA11453066	I'm Irish and i pronounce it "ley-sure", i also say my-grain too!! I dont think you should follow English pronunciation cos they dont really pronounce stuff right, they say "fink" for think, and someink for something, and also they dont pronounce their R's at the end of words, they say "rida" instead of rider...    Some English that is...|`|AA12399618	I personally think migraine is a localised thing in England there are many words people pronounce differently depending on which part of the country we are in. I for one would never say fink instead of think!   I say "mygrain" my mother always calls them "meegrain"   As for Leisure - I do not know of any other pronunciation in England for the word apart from the one that sounds like "pleasure"  There are quite a few Americanisms which make me wince :)   Saying that migth cause controversy - now how do you say that one!!|`|d82c39e98ba13a19462e0c52c3290cb4aa	Yeah over in England we pronounce leisure as "leh-sure". and you've pretty much perfected migraine, as we also pronounce it "my-graine"|`|606bd6e268a7597fa099346bd8012a99aa	This is the correct English way of pronounceing the word.  Leh-sure|`|ef4da24f522a255ef0d011f1290449baaa	The way John pronounces it is the way it pronounced in England and basically everywhere else...and so 'MEE-grain' is how we, the rest of the world say migraine.

AA11476749	No.  Cremation merely does in a couple of hours what it takes decades to do through burial.

Op81lhjuaa	Can Atheists be ethical?    The answer to this question is a definite, "Yes." Atheists are people who, whether they like it or not, have the law of God written on their hearts (Rom. 2:15). They are subject to the same laws of our country (and other countries) and they have a sense of right and wrong. They often work with people who are religious and have ethical standards as well as non-believers who are don't.  So they are exposed to all sorts of moral behavior.  In addition, they often form their own moral standards based on what suits them.  Besides, robbery, lying, stealing, etc., can get you imprisoned, so it is practical and logical for an atheist to be ethical and work within the norms of social behavior.  How ever you want to look at it, atheists, generally, are honest, hardworking people.    Nevertheless, some Christians raise the question, "What is to prevent an atheist from murdering and stealing? After all, they have no fear of God and no absolute moral code." The answer is simple: Atheists are capable of governing their own moral behavior and getting along in society the same as anyone else.    At the risk of labeling the atheist as self-centered, it does not serve the best interests of an atheist to murder and steal since it would not take long before he was imprisoned and/or killed for his actions. Basically, society will only put up with so much if it is to function smoothly. So, if an atheist wants to get along and have a nice life, murdering and stealing won't accomplish it. It makes sense for him to be honest, work hard, pay his bills, and get along with others. Basically, he has to adopt a set of ethics common to society in order to do that. Belief in God is not a requirement for ethical behavior or an enjoyable life.|`|AA11058044	Good = doing something which benefits other people, other living organisms, or the universe as a whole.    Evil = deliberately doing something which harms other people, other living organisms, or the universe as a whole, even if it benefits you in the short term.    It's as simple as that.    Killing babies = harming other people = Evil.    Raping old ladies = harming other people = Evil.    Dumping toxic waste into the ocean = harming other people and other organisms = Evil.    Stealing a candy bar from the corner store = harming the store owner and other customers = Evil.    Smoking a substance that makes you feel funny, act like a moron, and waste the day playing Playstation = doesn't actually harm anyone = not evil, not good, and thus no one else's business.    Loving relationship between two dudes = doesn't actually harm anyone = not evil.    Sexual relationship between a minor and an adult = harms the minor, who cannot make an informed choice about their relationships = Evil.    It's all pretty simple, and no bearded skydude needed!|`|uUCTem2Eaa	I determine Right and Wrong by a moral philosophy called consequentialism. It basically states if an action leads to more harm than good, it is immoral, and if an action leads to more good than harm, it is moral.

True morals are about not hurting others physically or mentally.|`|2h8tqOeFaa	The Atheist view of good and evil is just the same as how a Christian refers to it..|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	Good, evil, right, wrong - they're social constructs.|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	Morality is relative.  That isn't an opinion, but a well demonstrated fact.  Take homosexuality for example.  Never mind the fact that it is completely natural (as people are doing it and if it weren't then they wouldn't be), but it is also demonstrated in other non-human animals.    Now, two people loving and caring for each other should, in no way, be viewed as immoral, but many religious people do, simply because a book that decrees that it itself is not only moral, but morality itself says that it is wrong.  There is no intellectual justification for this belief whatsoever, it is just written in the Bible, so I'll suspend all critical faculties and call it immoral, as an example.    In my opinion good and evil, morality and immorality are simple: if you take pleasure in the pleasure of others, and displeasure in the displeasure of others, you're moral.  If you take pleasure in the displeasure of others, and displeasure in their pleasure, you're immoral.|`|AA10556726	Perhaps you should take the Philosophy course "Ethics" which is the study of moral systems.  Studying anthropology and social  sciences will help as well.    The abbreviated version is that humans are social animals and like other social animals, we have acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.  People consider acceptable behavior to be right and unacceptable behavior to be "wrong/evil".  Additionally there are other factors that influence what behaviors are acceptable or not, for example we have a sense of self survival, the survival of our family and survival of our group.  We also have varying degrees of empathy and realize that by working together we can accomplish more than by working just for ourselves (part of being a social animal).|`|nXxtBkguaa	okay, not athiest, but my idea of what is good and what is evil doesn't come from god so I'll still answer.    yes, that would be wrong of you.  Evil I can't be sure of, it depends on alot of factors, one being your upbringing, I believe that there's a definate division between being wrong and being evil.  Your actions can be wrong, you, yourself can be evil.    good is treating others and your environment in a more then respectful manner.  Good is doing everything for others that you wish they would do for you.    My idea of good came from my parents, I geuss, but there's a difference between learning what is right and deciding what is right.  So I chose to believe what I believe, so that came from thinking, and what started the thinking was... everything, my entire environment.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	Just because someone is Atheist doesn't necessarily mean that they don't understand the difference between right and wrong.|`|czf6uhIraa	You got it all wrong.  Killing babies and raping old ladies isn't wrong.  It would be wrong if you didn't eat the baby and old lady afterwards!|`|mansEgYQaa	if it hurts one person to me it is evil, unless the hurt was an accident or very minimal|`|UL6FcEliaa	We can define morality as a value system where we value freedom and feelings and other rights EQUALLY, whether it involves yourself or anyone else.  Then, we can recognize immorality.|`|tW86bOMNaa	Broadly, that which harms is evil; that which does not, is good.    And our sense of good/evil comes from intellect, from an evolved sense of virtue, and from social pressure along with laws.|`|ow2gVYeqaa	you might be sincere in your question; and  nothing against you; but this type of question especially when it comes to atheist usually brings out the fact that they have a double standard; absolute morals when it comes to others;relative morals when it comes to themselves.|`|X548yCR6aa	My parents taught me what's right and what's wrong. If they had taught me killing babies is good, that's what I would do, killing babies all day long. However, one must ask himself whether a society in which baby killing is considered good can last in the long run.    The answer is nope, it cannot. There are many evolved altruistic traits, and many cultural altruistic traits for that very reason.|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	good and evil are the same for everyone..      good is kindness and compassion    evil is hurtful and destructive|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	There is no such thing as "good" and "evil" objectively, these are purely subjective opinions.  People generally see things that benefit them personally as "good", and things that harm them as "evil".      If you killed babies and raped women, that would be illegal.  I don't care if you consider it "good" or "evil," because you'd be going to prison, so I wouldn't have to worry about you being around my children or mother anymore.  I wouldn't consider it "evil," I'd consider it a serious crime, and I'd be more than happy to testify against you if given the opportunity.|`|YYsldZcYaa	"good and evil and right and wrong" are all human concepts- Your concept of acceptable behavior and unacceptable behavior is an agreement with society- if you don't go around killing people and stealing, the rest of society will accept you- if not, they may kill you or exile you.  The labels put on these concepts (good evil right wrong) are determined on a "per group" basis... which accounts for variation among cultures.      This concept can be seen with the varying foods we eat, treatment of animals, treatment of criminals and the handicapped and the elderly, treatment of the terminally ill, capitol punishment, cannibalism, Women's rights, Racial issues, Slavery, Gay rights, etc...    It all depends upon your upbringing and what the people around you will accept.    No, Maurice- we look with our own eyes- not the ones shaded by the rosy red tint of your fairy tale goggles.|`|TGIQtgsWaa	Labeling something good or evil is a judgment.|`|Kl56NSmLaa	'Good' is short for 'what I want' and 'evil' is short for 'what I don't want'.  This is true for everybody. We try to persuade other people to agree with us, by example or by discussion. Or sometimes we try to force people to agree with us, by making 'laws' and punishing them and putting them in prison if they don't do what we want. Or sometimes we kill them if they won't do what we want - the death penalty.    There is no need to think there are some 'metaphysical' realities called 'good' and 'evil'.|`|fZLqh2nHaa	Anything that hurts no one is good.  Anything that hurts someone else is bad.  The grey areas between determine whether your action is mostly good or mostly bad.  The area so good it's beyond not hurting anyone and actually helps others becomes great, wonderful, amazing or whatever adjective you wish in the circumstances.  The area so bad that it helps no one and does nothing but hurt takes you on to evil.|`|AA11864826	Personally, I view the whole "good and evil" question as something purely subjective. For every action that someone can do that is evil, that exact same action can be used for good.     Murder is evil, but some people just need to die for the collective good of our species. Mass murderers, rapists, child molesters... you know... evil people... I view killing people like that as a good thing.    On the other hand, that which is good can also have evil counterparts or become a "force"of evil through abuse or unintentional means. For instance, the Gatling Gun was invented as a method of ending a war so less soldiers could die. You know, peace through greater firepower... Anyway, the Gatling Gun went on to become one of the most important military killing machines in history. Good idea, evil execution.    However, good and evil are extremes. The world is not really an extreme sort of place where  good and evil are concerned. It's a middle of the road, wishy washy kinda place. Life is  mostly varying shades of gray.    -SD-|`|98XPkvSqaa	I'm not sure I understand what believing in god has to do with understanding or not understanding the difference between right and wrong.      The concept of god was invented by man to teach morality and to hold the peons in thrall.  If an individual is 'inner directed' and understands the essentials of humanness without having to refer to god, then one understands the difference between right and wrong.      The people who benefit from a believe in god are those who, for some obscure reason, can't understand 'rightness' and decency without reference to god.|`|LF2t9DPZaa	Yes, that would be wrong of you. That's called common sense.    My concept of right and wrong comes from common sense and human cultural evolution, just as everyone else's does. The fact that some people think their morals come from a supernatural deity or force doesn't make it true.|`|JqHkgWROaa	If your hurting someone other than yourself, then yes you're wrong. (Obviously only under the pretense that hurting your causing is on purpose).    This is my opinion.     You are more than welcome to cause all the pain and suffering to yourself you want. You control your own life.    I would say my concept of "good" and "bad" comes from my natural instinct to survive as well as for survival of the race.

See the movie "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"     It really ties the links between evolution and religion quite nicely and exposes the shortcomings and fallacies of the theory of evolution.....it's quite lacking.   One of the best movies I've enjoyed...|`|4Za1utmCaa	Absolutely! Why not?     People misunderstand Evolution and think that it deals with Creation. It DOES NOT! Creation without God is what some astronomers and quantum physicists believe. Darwin doesn't address it. Evolution only speaks of how life evolved on Earth AFTER creation. I believe God created the Earth and life evolved according to the principles of Evolution after Creation.     In addition, as long as you understand the Bible is figurative at times, Evolution is reconcilable with the Bible as well.|`|ij5Sv6staa	If a day to God is actually millions of years on earth, isn't it plausible that when God created life, that that process of creation included evolution?  Perhaps on the 5th day when he created the creatures of the sea, it started with small organisms that evolved into larger creatures over that day (millions of years) ?    The same with the creatures on land that were created on the 6th day. Perhaps they started out as dinosaurs that during the course of a God day, died out and smaller reptiles and mammals, and eventually man came into prominence?    I think the ability of life to change to adapt to it's surroundings is a very intelligent design, don't you?|`|tg9Wj5Bpaa	i believe that God made the world and the universe, that doesn't mean that there is not a scientific explanation of the process.  as the years go by, less and less is actually a mystery.

Hey, If God is God, why couldn't he make the world in 6 days?|`|a9rVonHJaa	Watch so-called theistic evolutionist cockroaches come out of their hiding...      The only way is as a Deist.    yeah I guess all you Catholics wouldn't be catholic if you didn't believe the Poope was infallible.    Because the Poope says they are not in conflict does not make it so. Christianity is not compatible with evolution PERIOD.    If you think it is, then please explain the environmental impact of Jesus' life to cause speciation., or explain how speciation in primates produced a so-called 'infallible' human who never reproduced, regarded as a smug ****** in his time( much like many regard atheists today) did not survive death and was only about only 4'9" tall by most accurate conjecture, assuming he even existed.    morons...      that goes for jews and muslims as well...|`|zefFTf8Aaa	yes, catholics do.  http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/04...|`|eeqgk5ytaa	yeah i do. im jewish and don't believe much of the stuff in the bible but i listen to it and it's good stories with good lessons. you can believe that god created evolution, which is what i think. well, when it comes to this stuff, in i go with their stuff and in science i go with evidence. kinda like two personalities but not really. oh back really back in europe way back there was a group (i think deism or something) that believed that god created everything and then left. so that's a possibility. either way you go, support religious tolerance. it's the only way we can survive, and evolve.|`|a2ad85279bdbdf860b0895b8fbeb7b30aa	i believe in god. marvel at ALL around you. do you really believe that this can all come to be from a tadpole that wiggled onto land?  i think not.      "every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that jesus christ is lord"  amen.|`|KnZ0FpkFaa	Yes  I do    I just do.  God can exist, and so can evolution.  The only real reason that people see otherwise is probably because of a tightly knit theory they have from the religious text they read.  They then just become too stubborn to consider other possibilities that what they read, may have in fact meant something else.    For example, man was created from dust.  Life originated from amino acids and such, which could possibly be an god's attempt to explain the best way he could amino acids.    Another possibly is Spinoza's idea of god, which is kinda like a pantheistic /panentheistic approach to it.  God is The Universe|`|R5MW3BSsaa	No! I only believe in god!|`|y8p5GHaZaa	Though it would not appear that way on YA, the vast majority of christians believe in god and evolution.|`|E9chZY74aa	The two are diametrically opposed.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Not me.

Not everyone takes the two Genesis creation myths as factual reports.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Sure, it's possible to believe in both God and evolution. I'm a Roman Catholic, and Catholics have always understood that God could make life any way he wanted to. If he wanted to make it by the playing out of natural law, then who were we to object? We were taught in parochial school that Darwin's theory was the best guess at how God could have made life.    I'm still not against Darwinian evolution on theological grounds. I'm against it on scientific grounds. I think God could have made life using apparently random mutation and natural selection. But my reading of the scientific evidence is that he did not do it that way, that there was a more active guiding. I think that we are all descended from some single cell in the distant past but that that cell and later parts of life were intentionally produced as the result of intelligent activity. As a Christian, I say that intelligence is very likely to be God.|`|nzHtrczVaa	A radiocarbon year would also not equal a calendar year if, for example, the half-life of carbon-14 has changed, if carbon-12 or carbon-14 was added to or leached from the specimen being dated, or if the formation rate of carbon-14 in the upper atmosphere changed.    . In 1952, when Willard Libby first published his work on radiocarbon dating, he called attention to the critical assumption that the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 has been constant. He tested that assumption by making various measurements and calculating how rapidly carbon-14 was forming and decaying. Surprisingly, he saw that carbon-14 was forming faster than it was decaying. That meant there was much less atmospheric carbon-14 in the past. If we did not know that, we would incorrectly conclude that the lack of carbon-14 in dead animals and plants was because much time had passed and the carbon-14 had decayed.|`|TKZAYJokaa	i believe in both. however my idea of God is not that awful guy from the bible. but i definately believe all this has meaning and there is a greater power out there, and i call this God. so yeah i can believe in both.

If you ever did accept Jesus free gift of salvation, you would never give that up. So I doubt that you ever were a Born Again Christian. A lot of people claim to be one and aren't. They think that all they have to do is just go to church, quote a few scriptures and poof... your a christian.     Being a Born Again Christian takes sincere dedication and only God recognizes a true repenter of sins. If you go through the motions with out your sincere emotions, God knows this. I do feel sorry for you though, and I will keep you in my prayers that someday you will truly find your way to Jesus. Because when you do, you will never want to walk away from such a wonderful merciful friend, protector, guide in life, and Lord.|`|Lc8hkjHPaa	Hopefully, your bravery has inspired at least one of them to reveal their own possible disbelief. The problem with religion in families is that even with loving relationships an individual may still have fears of being disowned, and therefore stays in the fold, eventually succumbing to total placation or blind faith. This is more powerful in some religions than others.|`|oVail6aAaa	it's not hateful and close-minded.   they would probably treat you differently, but not out of disgust.   if they really care for you then they would want you to be saved, and would do everything they could to bring you to Christ|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I doubt your family, if they are Christian, will do anything but love you and pray for you.

AA10067344	Psychological studies indicate that there are many differences between  young boys and girls (and even full-grown men and women).  Of course, there are always exceptions to every rule.  The nurturing instinct is usually stronger in girls so it makes sense that they are more often inclined to play with dolls.    There are also very real physical differences.  Men are generally better at spacial recognition while women tend to have sharper proximal senses.    Like anything else, it is all a mixture of biological inclination and learned behavior.|`|gGd3v3M5aa	It is because people encourage gender specific roles, that most people end up that way. It's not a choice, its not natural, its constructed.|`|bPAgHvZnaa	Growing up I played video games, wore boys clothes, played with action figures, played with cars, had dolls, had barbies, loved watching action movies, reading, so on and so forth.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	I agree with the answers above, it's a learned thing, taught by parents and society. My parents didn't care that I wanted to be a bit more boyish than most girls. I still played with barbies but I played with toy cars as well. They let me, but only so far; I think it's because they didn't want me having a remote controlled car in the house ;) I would say that parents that let their children choose are being better parents because they are looking out for the child's interest; isn't that what part of raising a child is about, making sure their interests are taken care of too?    There are many men out there that are just as nurturing as a woman and there are women out there that are just as tough as a man and don't fall into the role of nurturers. So I believe it can be learned but a majority of us fall into the basic gender roles.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Boys and girls know what they like. Its up to the parents to reenforce gender roles. Its not a bad thing in any way. Girls playing with dolls gives her tools she will need to be a good mother latter in life. Boys playing with cars can help him with working or making or designing cars latter in life. What is wrong with that? If a girl wants to play with cars with her brother or if her brother has a tea party with his sister does not mean anything. let them play. Good luck.|`|V5lxDoIRaa	When I was very young I always wanted to play with my sisters dolls and my parents, tried to make me play with cars and boy things, but about the age of five I started acting out. When I started telling my parents that I was a girl and not a boy they tried even harder to make me like boy things and the more they tried the more I acted out.     With that said I do agree that there are some truths  in gender stereotypes. But when a transsexual such as myself wants to play with dolls and dress like a girl, their parents can not except the fact that their little boy is actually a girl. So they enforce the stereotypical gender roll on the child. Which if not corrected could cause the child to grow up with life long conflicts about who and what they are.|`|FqiA5BRraa	I used to make clothes for my cousins barbies. Most kids parents teach their child what too play with. Some other parents just let the child do, what interest the child. (those are good parents).
UibsALccaa	Regent Park Mosque is huge!! But beautiful masha'Allaah.    I suggest that you cover your hair if you are going to walk in but it may be hard to find the Imam straight away because he is very busy. So I think that you should phone up first and book an appointment with him. That way, you can see him and you will have enough time to brace and prepare yourself. When you go, give him the Islamic greetings but don't shake his hand. And dress appropriately so he knows that you are serious. But if you don't wear jilbaab all the time then you don't have to wear it to meet him. Wear a long skirt and long sleeve top. Go with someone as well so you don't feel alone and they can't help you.    If your parents are dead set against you marrying the man, then you will have to have the imam or your brother as the wali. And they reason that they are again the marriage isn't valid in Islam so the Imam should understand.    Also, pray Istikhara and seek guide from Allaah. Insha'Allaah, it will all work out for you    Hope I've Helped|`|TbPcMYkfaa	yes you should wear your abaya and hijab or niqab. When you spproach the imam, make sure to be modest and kindly tell him about your situation. After you tell him you can make dua and ask allah swt to help you with your decision. Your parents are tribalists which is not apart of islam. you should really talk to them.|`|UpIjgNV5aa	Imam's advise is not necessarily a precise outcome meaning a clear cut answer, and of course will be from personal perspective, and hence the necessity to talk to different Imams, and also don't forget Female Scholars (no idea what is the equivalent of Imam for female).      You're in London which is good as it is very multicultural. Of cousre I'm assuming you've thought of every aspect you can think of from A to Z. To meet an Imam you simply have to me in modest clothes doesn't necessarily mean cultural, of course you'll be in the mosque and is preferable that your head is covered not necessarily Hijab.     Here's what I would advise you. Do Istikhara Allah(SWT) knows best. You'll have an idea and from there you can proceed however you want to. Inshallah if it is Lords will you can go ahead and proceed regardless. Inshallah your parents would come around sooner or later. So I would really encourage you to Istikhara, if you insist on meeting an Imam, do it even before meeting him. Inshallah everything will workout!!|`|mOWyzwubaa	think twice think all your life its worth it,but what you want to do,could ruin you.i dont need to tell you why|`|vMAEeh66aa	Yes , wear Abaya and hijab all black .  and don`t wear any gold or something like that .

Becuase they think that Biracial people calling themselves black is somehow "disrespectful" of the white parent. Anne Coulter is the leader of these idiots.     2. And plus everyone wants to claim famous and successful people. They can't accept that Barack and others have lived their lives with racism and as a black person until they become famous. These same white people are then shocked when Halle Berry refuses to rewrite her personal history for them. How rude of her. lol If Halle Berry and Barack had done nothing with their lives and were average people and/or criminals we all know nobody would be trying to cry how white they are. They would be black people. End of story.    3. As another ignorant answerer (clearly a white person) has pointed out- they think it's all a publicity ploy or attention getter or in order to get a scholarship. They do not see the truth. I have put up with racism from whites who think I'm black and certain blacks who did not fully accept me in their world. I got my numerous scholarships and full rides on merit- because I am smart and a good student (a perfect score on my verbal SATs). I don't need affirmative action. Plus who would go out of their way to be a black person unless it was truly their identity? lol I'm just saying, a few scholarships does not make up for the omnipresent racism against blacks in our society. Whites still have it better. But you can believe whatever you want, we are not "pretending" to be black for some paltry scholarship. I AM black and black is me.    EDIT: @ Shawnie. No if I biracial person who looked more "white" wanted to call themselves white I would not care and I don't think most black people would either. As long as they weren't trying to hide being biracial and their black parent. That's called self hatred and "passing" which is another issue altogether.|`|398p9O07aa	Because people are ALWAYS gonna put things to race, and it's stupid. It really shouldn't matter at all.

I'm not sure because I don't know them but it is definately possible. Especially in that part of the world.    Secondly, skin tone is not an indicator of race if it was than Asians and some Hispanics would be classified as white.   Race is based off of genetic makeup, not what you and your friends may think he looks like he has 50% white ancestry and 50% black ancestry, and I don't care what he calls himself, he is mixed.    Calling yourself a certain race doesn't magically change your race.

God bless.|`|m2jeeo4Laa	As a biracial person, I would prefer that other multiracial/biracial identified with who they are instead of what the world sees them as.  And it would be nice if society didn't judge or classify based on race.  But I don't have a bone to pick with anyone who chooses what "race" suits them.  Edit.    If you would to randomly select two blacks and two whites, it is very likely the whites have more in common genetically with one of the  blacks than each other, and the same for the two blacks.  I'm biracial and my skin color is white.  Anyone that meets me thinks I'm white.   If I identified as white because the world viewed me as white, what would you think?   That is the point.  If you are judged based on the skin color, then why are blacks upset with mixed race who don't identify as black?  It's a double standard.  We live in America and as much as we try to stand apart from each other by culture, we all have a similar American culture. If you took race out of the equation, culture is based more on  geography and "class"(income).  I think alot of the comments stem from ignorance though.  And I agree if Obama or Halle were unsuccessful, noone would care what race they identified as.|`|AA11210405	because they are only "black" when it's to their advantage to be black. If it gets them the minority job, or vote, or sympathy then they are black....  plus many of the all black community shun the ones who are only part black becuase they are not all black.....but as soon as they become famous then they seem to magically fit into their definition of black.     but we are not allowed to comment on this because if we do then we are racist.|`|r1BycC7Xaa	Because they are accomplished.

It's all down to the person, obama has called himself black because of experiences he suffered and Halle berry has because her mom raised her to identify as black, I mean she does look blacker then the average biracial. If it's any constellation Obama has called himself mixed race or 'mutt' how he put it. But both these people still honor and respect their white side, they just choose to involve themselve in their black side more.    About the pics you put up, sometimes skin color doesn't matter, because those Nigerian women who are full black have stronger features then Halle berry anyway.|`|XQZEa7oOaa	You need to honor ALL of your heritages (that you are aware of). It is a disrespectful to all your family if you don't. There would be probably be a larger outcry if they went the opposite and only focused on their white heritage.But then again, I don't give a crap about race just citizenship.|`|kdvy8Woqaa	I have to agree with the other poster who said people only want to claim them if they're successful or beautiful.    Both Barack and Halle have stated numerous times that they consider themselves black.|`|oOR511mFaa	In America during the slavery days and for many many years after, if you had a drop of African blood in your veins,  you were considered black. It didn't matter. So that kinda stuck with people. I myself am black American, Native American & Puerto Rican. I look mostly black, so i identify myself with black people. Now people want to be all PC as if they really care. They just want something to talk about.  And please stop calling us African American. We are not African and haven't been so for a long time. And also, most black Americans have very little African blood in their veins. You would be surprised at the DNA tests that prove that. Very few people in America are 100% anything. Thats what America is all about. I am black, Puerto rican and native thus i am American.    Mariah carey is Mixed with black and white.  She looks white tho, so people see her as white. Nicole Riche (not sure if i spelled that right because i dont pay attention to celebrities) is part black, but she doesnt look like it, so people see her as white. Its all about what you look like and that is what people identify you as. A lot of the times white people will ask me if im mixed. I ask them why and they will say stuff like "Well you really pretty for a black girl" . So ignorant. Just for that i tell them no, im 100% black.|`|c9b39ba1619a86eb939cf1b78c3d4a15aa	Because in the past they have tried so hard to promote the false, racist, idea that black people & culture is ugly, unintelligent, and untalented, basically inferior. Now that it is obvious that these ideas are racist and barbaric, and there are a host of people of color proving those ideas are false. They want to think that white culture is  a part of their success, or think that the fact that they may or may not be mixed is a credit to white culture.|`|AA11556445	The last link of the cutie with the braids wearing the white dress?

Focus on racial identity more than accomplishment, achievement, and integrity bespeaks fundamental Jim Crow construct.      There are far more important and significant generic concerns or issues in need of attentions than the lingering idle distractions regarding color of skin.

I've never heard of anyone getting upset over Halle and Barack calling themselves black, everyone accepts it. Their titles were first black woman to win an oscar, and obama is the first black president.    If they did I guess it would just be a product of racism, whites wanting to take credit for halle berry's beauty, and whites taking credit for obama or not wanting to accept a black president.

The one-drop rule was a tactic in the U.S. South that codified and strengthened segregation and the disfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites from 1890-1910. After Supreme Court decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson and related matters, White-dominated legislatures felt free to enact Jim Crow laws segregating Blacks in public places and accommodations, and passed other restrictive legislation. Legislatures sought to prevent interracial relationships to keep the white race "pure", long after slaveholders and overseers took advantage of enslaved women and produced the many mixed-race children.|`|e01b865c0771c47a4d22d3a9ad54d2efaa	I just wonder if it was switched around and the biracial person looked more white would the african americans be offended if  they did not identify there african roots?

Example: If Obama only called himself white or black, then the other race would get angry. Makes sense, they want credit too.    I think it's all pretty lame though.  I mean, Obama and Halle both look more black than white.    What they mean on the whole "first african american president" thing is he's part black. But, the media wants to make it more hypey, so he's only black, because that's never happened before.    But I don't get why people give a crap in the first place.

ur3vgbXoaa	Oh now you've done it, let me go dig out my dollar bill.   You have spent 14 cents.      Life is just like a dollar!  A hundred cents.  If you're lucky you have a hundred years.     When you get the dollar   you are anxious to spend it.     You spend a dime, or 21 cents   and you say, ' I still have plenty left.'     Then you've spent 32 or 41 cents   and you say, 'Gosh it is almost half gone!  Where did it go. This could get scary!'     But you know you still have lots left.   Then you've spent 50 cents,  you've spent 59 cents - 'Oh my goodness  can this be happening to me?'     60 cents - 65 cents   Now each penny seems more   and more important.     You keep trying to remember  each and every penny you spent  in the past what was it you spent it on?  Where did it go?    You have a hard time  remembering, but you know it is   gone and there is no way to get it back.     There is a longing to have the   whole dollar back and to start all over again.     This time you would be more sensible   about what you spent the pennies on,   cause NOW you realize they add up   and they add up quickly!     You have now spent 75 cents or 78 cents.   There is a feeling of panic. You don't want  to be broke.     You vainly try to think of something   worthwhile to spend the last few cents   on and you even start to wonder if you will   really have a whole dollar to spend.   You worry that maybe you really only have   79 cents or 82 cents, and then you will be broke.     There is no way to stop it and no way to   get it back.     Spend it wisely, because every single human   on this earth has the same chance to spend   their dollar and then it is GONE!     A lot of people live a hundred years today-   that is what I based the dollar on,   but a lot die in their 60s 70s 80s and 90s too,   so spend your first 50 or 60 years to   really make them COUNT!!!     Because life is like a hole in your pocket!   One minute you have it and the   next minute it is gone!     You dearly want it back, but it is gone forever!   What year are you in life.

I am a cynic, I see a missing half, it was mine before it was stolen and I want it back.  If the legs of the thief are broken in the process, so much the better.    Take care of yourself first and foremost as no one else gives a damn about you.  If you assume the worst from people through your life you will be pleasantly surprised two or three times.  You will be prepared all the time.    Live long and prosper...|`|AA12383371	Never take yourself too seriously.  To be able to laugh at yourself and others is a good thing.  What really matters are not things (such as a car) but the people you love, things can be replaced, but people cannot.  Pick your battles, some things are little and not really so important, so save the fight for those things that are really earth shattering, that really do make a difference.   Live life so that you stop and smell the roses, dance as if no one is watching and love as if you have never been hurt.  Do the things you love and do them with passion.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Learn early on to do your own thinking and listen to your self -  example: if a thing feels wrong it probably is.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	The answers here are just so good.  How refreshing!|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Learn from your mistakes and be a leader not a follower. Set realistic goals and don't let your peers negative attitudes affect your goals. Read the bible and keep prayer in your heart.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	The most important thing is to always think before you act, esp. as a teen.  Take a few moments to think of consequences that could result from an action.  Likewise sometimes the  action could bring rewards.  This rule can be applied to just about anything in life, esp. SEX.  Don't give in to peer pressure unless it is Positive Peer Pressure--friends encouraging you to succeed, to do well, to advise you on the right paths of life.  Also,always remember that a true friend is there for you in both good times and bad.  Always try to be a good friend and you should have them in return.|`|8G42oyydaa	You arent too young to learn that being completely honest is the best way to live your life.  Don't pretend to be someone you arent so another person will like you, be yourself at all times, and stay true to who you are.    Love and respect yourself and others will too.    As soon as you can, start investing for your future, when you get your first job start putting away $25 or $50 a month and you will be a rich lady someday and wont have to rely on others. For women money in the bank is freedom. Freedom to love someone who loves and appreciates you. Freedom to be happy in your life because you do have choices.    Dont let peer pressure cause you to make bad choices.  When you are 20 the people you may want to impress now wont even be a memory.     If you want a friend, be a friend, and visa versa. Pick a friend who is a friend.|`|jjt2enntaa	Plan ahead.  Don't take for granted things will turn out for the best.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	Respect everyone,put your school and studies first and always always save for a rainy day. I think young kids should learn to tithe to their church too but that's another story altogether.Your young for a much shorter time enjoy it but respect yourself  and don't compromise your beliefs and values.You have nothing to prove to anyone else but your self.Print all of this off and read it every month. It will lead you down the right path.One last thing rent the dvd The Secret and watch it. Good luck young man.God  be with you|`|AA12194228	Be honorable. Educate yourself to be skilled in whatever field you hope to work. Wake up each day giving thanks for the new day. Do not expect everything to go as planned, have backups. The best laid plans of mice and men oft times go astray.|`|85Aa4NHsaa	Don't be in a hurry to be an adult.  You are a child for 20 years max and an adult for 50 or more.  There is a reason all us adults wish we could be children again.  I was in such a hurry.........now I am bored.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	To thine own self be true.  Do not give yourself away, just to be "liked".  You have to like yourself, in order for others to like you.|`|AA11767291	Study hard , save your money , stay in school ; and choose your friends carefully  .|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Some of this advice will be tough to follow at your age but here goes.    For money, do whatever you can to stay out of debt. That means when you rent or buy a home, make sure your payments stay under one fourth of your bring home pay. When you are married and both work, keep in mind getting pregnant changes that figure. Stay away from credit if you are not willing to pay the whole bill off every month. It's amazing what they can charge you when you don't.    Sex: I am pretty old fashioned so I'd say at the least, save it for the one you are likely to marry and make sure you are in a position to take care of a child even if the other person does not stick around.    Peer pressure is easy to fall into. I did and it never went all that well. Yeah, some of your friends maybe didn't get caught or did not get into trouble but it doesn't mean you wont.    Relationships: Just take your time. There will be plenty of time to get married and start a family unless you start around age 70. Make sure you LIKE the person and not just love/lust for them. Some of the best relationships start with being good friends and getting to know one another. Even then, when you get married, that's when you REALLY get to know someone.    Cooking" Well, personally I think everyone, male or female should know how to fix some basic meals. When you get on your own, you'll learn or spend a ton of money going out to eat. ( see the part about being tight with money)    Beauty: Many girls I went to highschool with were wall flowers compared to the cheer leaders and pom pom girls. At my 20th re-union, the wallflowers were absolutely beautiful and the cheer leaders and poms look like they had been rode hard and put up wet as well as being pretty heavy. They also only relived their "glory" highschool days.Pretty much same with the "jocks".    You'll do fine if you trust your gut instinct and ,believe it or not, listen to mom and dad and Grandma and grandpa. We all screwed up somewhere along the line. Just dont make a habit of it. Time is fleeting so appreciate what you have now and just take it easy and dont try to get " grown -up " too quick.    Best I could do for now but I had to take my lumps so I had to pass them on.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Mymost important piece of advice to you is listen to your inner-voice you know that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when something or someone just doesn't sit right  & be who you are as a person  I want  to wish you good luck in all your future endeavors & just  stay true to yourself OK  You have a good head on your shoulders  you are going to go far  Take care

Then to top it off, get him a t-shirt of that band or singer........oh and be super nice to him while it's valentine's day time.|`|9osY93Tcaa	Well, first of all u guys are in love and u don't like to draw attention.But this is a big day for loverz.so do what u have to do i suppose he knows u are not a big fan of attention so the last thing he will expect is for u to do something big.

QCYad4jUaa	No,you should not be offended. Hopefully you love and appreciate your own father more than the guy you are with. Your father is attractive, for he created a black queen...enough said.     YOU should evaluate the people you consider friends. There are few people that are deserving of that title. Its good to have friends with an "open" mind and its another thing to be down right insulting to an entire race of men. There are a plethora of beautiful black men. "Too many 2 list." Perhaps they are telling you something about yourself indirectly. I hope you found me helpful. The Relationship Guru!|`|hHjPFxEdaa	Well for every one of your friends who says they aren't I can show you 5 who says they are. Everyone has a right to their own sexual preferences but don't paint all with the same brush as the few.|`|oYVxMmbQaa	What Black men do THEY look at everyday?!    I wouldn't be offended because I know everyone has different tastes, but it would definitely leave me baffled.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	then my question for them would be then, why are soooo many of them jumping their bones? all 3?     And then I'd show them these pics ...    http://www.imeem.com/groups/hTQMiK3f,if_...    add: it's so hilarious how you get thumbs down for telling it straight...haha! It's lonely when you dont follow...what I stated was absolutely true...Black men get all 3 of these type of women---all day! and you can stop hating on the beautiful pics. we all have eyes. they are built beautiful, they have beautiful skin and the most testosterone.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	lmfaooo    they're either racist, stuck up or just full of sh*t...i know COUNTLESS of my dudes that bagged women of ALL races.     And yes, you should be offended...unless im wrong, im pretty sure your father is a black man. Just as i would be offended if some of my caucasian/asian or latino dudes said that black ladies were unattractive.|`|DfDss68haa	It depends on their phrasing.    "Black men are not attractive/they are ugly"  That is racist and incredibly self centered and stupid comment    "I don't find Black men attractive."  That is preference and perfectly acceptable.    I just find it annoying when people decide their preference is reality. Get over yourselves! Just becuause you don't find a type sexy doesn't make this everyone's reality.     Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.  But still I would consider them a little insane. I mean really black men aren't attractive?! Whatever, more for me, Lol  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IPH5F2pt...|`|98wFqBwSaa	Huh?  You know how many Latin Mamis I let ride the magic stick.  And shyt, I've stabbed a couple of Asian Hoez in my day too.  As for the Sarah Lee's we all know they live to suck off Black athletes.  I think you're trolling.  GTFOH!!!|`|JOdlqhQwaa	You gals are fine as long as your lips aren't too thick.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	You're not a black man, so don't be offended. And even if you were a black man, that is your friends personal preferences.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	Some black guys are unattractive just like some latinos, Asians and Caucasians but to say all black men are unattractive in general is false. I wouldn't get offended though it's their ignorant opinion, just tell them to stop announcing it everywhere.|`|34ef9b5db01d0490398c0b739c7ef078aa	don't be offended. more for us.    but seriously... to find an entire race of men unattractive. that doesn't sound right to me|`|OTnSwNwZaa	Don't be offended. If it hurts, just avoid those "friends".  They're not blind,t hey just have their own opinions. Most non-Blacks do not find Blacks attractive. That's just the way it is.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	If they always tell you,and constantly bring up that black men are not attractive to them, then they are trying to offend you and you do not need to be around that kind of people, anyways. If they said it once or every now and then than just accept them, no big deal, everyone has their own idea of beauty.|`|OZjlW5utaa	You probably get offended because your black, I don't blame you, because I would if someone said that to me, but if it's only a preference there's nothing wrong with it. Although some people should broadern their horizons.|`|AA10866651	If your caucasian/asian/latina friends don't find black men attractive, then they don't have to date black men, and they should therefore quit b*tching and mind their own business.      If you frequently find your friends' comments offensive, you should perhaps find less douchebaggy friends to hang out with.|`|mMm0INjfaa	you should find out the reason why they think so if it offends you then be offended,,,if it doesnt thats more people to not be scared that they would take away your man|`|ecFH28Yyaa	Nay! Everyone has their own preference!    Plus I'm sure they haven't seen my crush! Every girl agrees that he's attractive! In ratings, he's never gotten less then an eight! And this comes from woman of all races! He's a hottie!     In my eyes he's beautiful!    Edit: Why did I get thumbs down?|`|7sgJuukQaa	I'm an American Indian dude......so I wouldn't know, but hey everyone has their taste..|`|V7iRigVJaa	I do not think you should be offended. People just have different taste is all.    It is possible they may be blind, too LOL.|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	if they are your "friends" they would not tell you that. I dont tell my other race of friends that their men are ugly even if they look like the bottom of my shoe. its just rude.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	Asian speaking, I find a lot of black men more attractive than other races...I don't know why. I also know plenty of women who have a thing for black men. Even if they don't, it's probably because they're not "taught" that is whats good looking, or its just because of preference.    I like darker skin/tan, I can't help it.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	A persons colour or race should not be a consideration in judging a persons attractiveness.   Many other races are jealous of the myth that all black guys are well endowed, they are sadly mistaken and bigoted.  I actually prefer males or females with brown skin colour, I find them very attractive, that includes some asians and latins!|`|dyFRchmtaa	i think you should be happy cause, its more 'white women with black men'... ive never seen a white man and black woman.. in ages..     in the uk it is a fact that black half of black men in relationships, are in relationships with white women here..     only a third of black women are in biracial relationships..|`|UAFn5v0Vaa	Not all caucasions/asians/latinas think that. My boyfriend is black, puerto rican and white. Before I started dating him, I only found a couple light skinned black men attractive. In my opinion, I'm not trying to offend anyone, I just don't like dark skin. Tan looking skin is what I prefer, just not too dark. But then another reason why I never really looked at too many black men is because most of the ones I know are complete jerks lol. But thats just my opinion. My best friend is black and she actually doesn't like black men, she likes puerto ricans. But I don't think you should be offended because everyone has a different opinion.|`|ejo0CQkuaa	Nope, I don't care and beside from experience its the complete opposite.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	I think it's interesting how people make a point of saying that black people aren't attractive. Racist much?|`|QTJhmClRaa	I would have a problem with that. I'm in your boat with the interracial thing. But you will never hear me side with a non-black person against a Black man. Never.

So . . . wealthy white guys . ..  . they share the wealth AND power with lots of other folks there days.    Dan in Miami    P.S.  You might want to ask your shrink to up your meds . . . and you  need to TAKE your meds every morning.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	so whats your question?    but u know what they say, that with immigration comes a great knowledge and who has immigrated more then jews?|`|4BQXYxPYaa	As I walk past the lavish mansions in the rich part of town...many of them owned by jews, I often stop and wonder....why the hell don't I own one?    Oh yeah, I'm NOT RICH.    So there goes your theory.    And by the way, jew isn't a race.|`|yS9a9jk5aa	Jews are just very close and believe in helping each other thats all.|`|jbDTsZyBaa	You may just have a point. But you can't blame average Jewish people with normal lives for what some of them are doing. There are Jews and there are Zionists. They are not necessarily the same thing.    http://www.jewsnotzionists.org/differenc...|`|jiMAtaCraa	This is silly conspiracy.|`|YeWl5L0saa	do i smell an anti-semite?|`|hkvWDU3xaa	I am not Anti Semite, but I am Muslim and believe that alot of the problems we have with the Middle East is a result of the Jews. America basically took the Land away from the Palestinians and made them refuge, and gave it to the Jews so they would have Israel a Nation to call their own. I say we let them fend for themselves. Middle Eastern Countries would like America more for it and we wouldn't have to deal with all the problems the Jews create over there.
f5FmJRfIaa	Well, perhaps what you attracted has to do with what you are sending out.  What sort of energy are you sending out?  If you have low self esteem, or low confidence, and things like that, then that is likely to affect the energy you are sending out, and you would then attract someone who is looking for someone like that.  You have a trust issue with the ex, if you aren't emanating trusting energy, then you will attract someone who can't be trusted.  If you are emotionally whole, and feeling good about yourself, then the energy you sent out will attract someone who is likewise.  If you are sad, depressed, low in confidence or self esteem, then the energy you send out will attract someone who responds to those sort of qualities.  Unfortunately, people who respond to those sort of qualities are not generally someone you want in a mate.  Maybe instead of focusing on the lack of a mate in your life, you should take a break from that, and focus on making sure that you are whole, confident, and emotionally healthy.  Whatever works to help you feel better about yourself.  I am picking up that the main thing you are sending out is a sense of "lack", a desire for a mate to "complete" you, and the response you are getting is because you are motivated by lack.   To use the law of attraction to attain a suitable mate, it is not enough to send out an idea of what you want in a mate.  The right mate is looking for someone with certain qualities as well. You need to project qualities that the kind of person you want to meet would appreciate.  If you want someone who is confident, then you need to be confident.  If you want someone who is trustworthy, then you need to be trusting. If you want someone who is happy and centered in his life, then you need to be happy and centered in yours.  If you aren't any of those things, then when you send out energy tinged with low self esteem, you will attract someone who preys on women with low self esteem, and if you send out energy without trust, you will attract someone who is not trustworthy.  If you send out energy based on "lack" you will not attract someone who is happy and whole in his life, but someone who is also looking for a mate out of lack.  Maybe you should just give the looking for love in all the wrong places thing a break, and find something else to throw yourself into for awhile.  Start a business, or take a class, or build something.  Get your confidence up, find something to get a sense of achievement from, then try again later.  It's when you stop looking for someone to complete you, when you become complete of yourself, that someone will appear. Good luck...  (Never read "the secret" myself, if this book has anything to do with it.  Don't know how the book in question goes about explaining it.)|`|H4rrbOW5aa	Why would you want to be with someone who don't trust and who treated you badly?     Your ex may felt the energy that you used to have tied up in him waning when you met the man you visualized.     Trust what is in your heart, not what you think the past obliges you to do. Perhaps you can take some time to figure out what you really want, and maybe you don't need to take any action at this time at all. Just be certain you are making a clear choice that will support you, and trust that it will be the right decision.|`|vnSskmVRaa	This might be an issue of you not feeling like you deserve anything better than your Ex.  Consciously you may be affirming that you want a person with these wonderful qualities, who treats you this wonderful way, etc.  But subconsciously you have thoughts like "I don't deserve someone like that", "I'm not good enough", or "Why would someone like that be interested in me?".  The sad truth is that what we believe is stronger than what we affirm or want.  Therefore, it's crucial to address your limiting beliefs around having a quality mate.  Once those are out of the way and you feel like you truly deserve a great new person, the path is cleared for him/her to come to you.  There are many great tools out there to help you identify and clear your limiting beliefs.  I have taken advantage of several that I found at http://www.lawofattractiontoolsite.com.  Good luck!|`|T5ztIAZbaa	IT MEANS THE LAW OF ATTRACTION ISN'T REAL.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	I'D FIND A NEW PERSON TO BE ATTRACTED TO, AND THEN GET MY KEYBOARD FIXED BECAUSE THE CAPS LOCK BUTTON STICKS.|`|qbelhflAaa	IT MEANS THE LAW OF ATTRACTION DOES NOT WORK AND YOU SHOULD TURN YOUR GODDAMN CAPS LOCK OFF.

I see several of us are in agreement on this point.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	please don't turn your brain off just because you read a book about the so-called law of attraction.    if he's bad for you, he's bad for you.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	just cause he's still alive doesn't mean you're suppose to let him hurt you again...|`|6aIuZZi7aa	It means you should turn the caps lock off.|`|KrdOKdJcaa	How do you "use" the "law of attraction" to find a mate?|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	It means you shouldn't believe in every New Age bogus theory you hear.  If your ex treated you badly, they're likely to treat you badly again if you get involved in another relationship.  Stop talking to him and throw out your copy of "The Secret".  Then do us all a favor and turn off your caps lock.|`|3a3e942c6ad42563faecc58bad4ee235aa	Have you never changed?  Maybe he feels different now that he has been away from you.

I was shocked, appalled, disgusted, and outright enraged while watching it. Not only did the show ruin my mood, all my bitching about the show ruined my special lady friend's mood. You may not be gay for watching it, but there are for sure severe psychological or biophysical issues with a guy who enjoys it.
ki0tOVUYaa	I am a deist because I believe in God but do not believe God interferes with human affairs because it would put God in a position that would make God unable to be consistent in loving everyone with agape love. Say God had something to do with the highway accident that made me late to the airport and I missed my plane. It blew up upon impact with the World Trade Center and I attribute my being saved to God: what am I to believe then about God's nature, having treated me with partiality but did nothing to save everyone on the plane? It doesn't work to believe God is an interventionist. However, God is personal and present in the form of universal life force and spiritual law, by which all can connect and find order and guidance in a troubled world. This is the Tao, the Holy Spirit, the imminent side of the transcendent God who is deistic in nature.|`|8pQrIL90aa	I am not a deist. God is active in my life through Jesus. The Lord of Lords.|`|mSFjbetxaa	As I was growing up I thought I was an open minded Christian.  I never bought the my way or hell mentality.

His studies in history, religions, and anthropology convinced him that religions are all culturally man made.|`|AA11729666	Yep, though it's not "tonight" anymore in my little corner of the world :)    Well I can say it just comes naturally I guess, my story isn't that dissimilar from yours.  I attended Catholic school and was an alter boy at church converted to Methodist- always uncomfortable at church though- something was constantly telling me that something was amiss and even derrogatory about the portayl of God and the way the world works.  At any rate I started looking around at different religions and different philosophies, never went down the atheist/agnostic road though as I had seen enough in the natural world for me to say that God definitely exists, and stumbled across a Deism website.  Lo and behold there I saw my own beliefs on the page laid out in words.  Been one ever since.      Here's a link to a group you may be interested in:  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Deism/

Its to make her feel safe or secure or with you.    Reading you question....   I dont know anybody that would hold your hand maybe they would be signing the restraining order against you.    Wow.

J3erdQCIaa	I'm a full blooded Oglala Lakota, we believe in something similiar.  We don't cut our hair either.  Its an old tradition but it still stands.  It represents tradition, strength, beauty, and when we lose someone we love dearly, we cut it and burn it.  My grandpa died in 2000, my mom, dad, aunts and myself each made one long braid and cut it all off, first time I had a bob haircut, its burned to signify a great loss, its not cut for just anybody.  Today my hair is now past my butt.    I hope this helps answer you question, though I'm not Apache.|`|Ty3NiCIWaa	Man with long hair look pretty, get more girls.|`|qpCUvqq8aa	After several years of folklore classes I've never heard of any.

xtKEToLHaa	I don't understand what's the big deal, what's the point of saying Mr X is Black and Mr Y is White, when they have only a small part of another heritage.  If someone that is 3/4 black and 1/4 white is considered Black, then why wouldn't a 3/4 white 1/4 black person person be considered White?  Is it not ok to say that Beyonc is biracial (1/4 white), but is it ok to say that Vin Diesel is biracial (1/4 black) ?   What is the reason for this double-standart? The "one-drop-rule"?  Hmm, I think I will never understand this american mentality...  I am White European ( 1/2 Belgian,1/4 Greek,1/4 Portuguese), so maybe I would be considered as biracial, or even Black, when I come to the US?...|`|oYVxMmbQaa	They all look mostly White to me. You can kinda tell Wentworth is multiracial when he lets his hair grow a little long. Vin Diesel is hit or miss. Sometimes, you can tell he's half Black, other times you can't. Carly Simon...I knew she was a quarter Black, but honestly, you can't tell by looking at her.    God, what I wouldn't give for a shot at Wentworth Miller!|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Vin Diesel actually looks mixed, you could see it in the nose and mouth     Carly Simon & Wentworth Miller not so much....though if all three of them let their hair grow natural it would be a different story lol|`|EmOnt7FIaa	All of them look white.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	I think its obvious, but then again I myself am multi racial, so I have been raised with a trained eye...like i have noticed for some reason, that men with mixed african-white dna tend to be more muscular prone then men that are either just of european descent or just african descent (my husband is really tall and muscular, but still has narrow hips and waist, like most of the african men I know do, but his little brother, who is half african half arab, is big and beefy, like a lot of africa american men and bi-racial american men) sure, there are very muscular men that are one raced, but like I said, for some reason the mix tends to make a guy more muscular prone. As for the women, I know about 15 women in my tribe who are 1/16 black, 1/16 native, and you can see traces of our tribe's genetic sterotypes in some (short, flat butt, round face, tans easily, etc..), and traces of african american sterotypes (tall, athletic, large bottoms, tans well)  in the others. They are all very distantly related, comming from one common ancestor from our tribe, but you'd think they were sisters if you stood them next to each other. As for Vin Disel, he is a perfect example of the beefy mixed guy I was describing, Carly Simon, with her athletic build (muscular yet still curvy, and you cant ignore the booty...) and lovely thick lips reminds me of my cousin kelly (one of the 1/16 black-native girls I mentioned) yeah, I can see it.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	I knew Vin Diesal, I always thought prison break guy looked "different" but did not know he was mixed. But,see how they automatically would identify as white? It is cause of how they look.    add: good observance salishlady.     and I agree with the other ladies about wentworth. yeah, he's nice.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	I always knew Vin Diesel was biracial but carly is a quadroon so she really doesn't count that's why she looks so white. Wentworth Miller looks white because he's mixed with a whole bunch of stuff not just black and white.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadroon|`|azKH25wZaa	Wentworth Miller is fine. No wonder!|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	Appearance does not matter, what matters is what they are|`|kdvy8Woqaa	Carly Simon looks white  Vin Diesel looks mixed  Wentworth Miller to me looks mixed, he has a very exotic look to him. I think it depends on what pic you see of him.    I knew Wentworth and Vin Diesel both had black ancestry but I didn't know about Carly Simon.|`|UmpJ0UCfaa	carly simon just looks like an ugly white woman with native or something....but now that i know i guess..  vin diesel definitely look half black. wentworth miller looks as white as the wall..so no i dont see it in him at all. didnt even know til now..|`|u8WyN7cHaa	holy shite!!! Michael Scofield has some black in him???    dayum! Dat's kool; had no freaking idea be4    now i kno|`|OZjlW5utaa	You can instantly tell with some if they are mixed just like me, my heritage Is like wentworth millers and people have always commented on how I don't look full white or I must have black in me etc. At first I would think vin diesal was white but he does have mixed ancestry. But the other lady just looks white, although she might get her lips from her black side.    Edit: true about the hair, when I grow my hair long it turns really curly.|`|DQKiWoUPaa	I think they all look mixed to me. People who say White are only looking at the color of their skin and not their features.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	I knew about them. Oh that Wentworth Miller. Oh the things I would do...|`|mMm0INjfaa	they are prolly irish or some white ancestry mixed but in a nutshell they are all white|`|T1beLIQqaa	Carly Simon is 1/4 Black,3/4 White- biethnic, Vin Diesel is half Black, dependinig on source 1/4 White, 1/4 Indian-either bi- or multi- ethnic, and Wentworth Earl Miller III is 1/4 Black and 3/4 White(includes Semitic(Arab and Jew) and Indo European Aryan)- biethnic.Biethnic and multiethnic are terms I created to more accurately portray diversity-use them and help me get them into popular usage. I would have guessed they all were mixed-the eyes, cheekbones, nose and lips are the most telling, then skull shape. Carly Simon resembles the late Dinah Shore, whom had some Black ancestry(another very interesting story-she and her husband had a Black baby in the late 1940's-gave up for adoption -husband accused her of an affair with Black men she sang with-not true-turns out she had Black ancestry her parents never informed her of-sued her father over it-mother was deceased).    EDIT-Nigerian-Wentworth is ONLY a Black/White mix- nothing else.    His FATHER is: African-American, Jamaican-BLACK, English, German-INDO European Aryan WHITE, and Jewish(Semitic WHITE) ancestry.    His MOTHER is: is of Russian, Dutch, French-Indo European Aryan WHITE, Syrian, and Lebanese-Arab (Semitic WHITE) ancestry.    Beyonce Knowles is multiethnic-Black/ White/Indian(Cherokee)

People I know who are going through rough times, and particularly those with kids who are having trouble buying enough groceries to feed their family.    When I don't know someone, I usually go through a local charity organization (that I know I can trust will actually use my money for good). Usually a food bank or local homeless shelter.    I am weary of organizations I have not heard of, and I would have to do a lot of research before I would feel comfortable giving them money. I have donated to the red cross before though, and at least at certain times they allow people to donate to specific people who are in need.    I would be willing to donate to the people of Afghanistan, but it would have to be through an organization I felt I could trust to give or spend the money directly on those who needed it. Maybe it would help if you posted links to those types of charities.|`|n49i9t6paa	My country|`|vMAEeh66aa	My country .|`|U5zcbHuZaa	The U.S. government is not out to end poverty in the world. If it were, it would spend billions of dollars per month on that rather than on war and it would not have a single enemy in the world.    The U.S. has millions of poor within its own borders, about 750,000 of them homeless, though that is an undercount, many of the homeless do not get counted in the census. Many stave off homelessness by moving in with relatives or friends, sleeping on couches or in extra rooms or on the living room floor.    Here is an interesting excerpt from National Homeless Coalition in U.S.,  http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publicat... ...    "In 2003, children under the age of 18 accounted for 39% of the homeless population; 42% of these children were under the age of five (National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, 2004)."    I experienced homelessness as a child, to use American terminology, it sucked big time. I've seen eviction sales in my neighborhood (that's when the landlord puts all your stuff on the sidewalk for everyone to go through after the sheriff has evicted you and you have no place to move your stuff to and so you lose nearly everything you own), one time, my daughter and I were walking past a house where one of her little friends used to live. We picked up her friend's coat and a sweater and later gave them to charity. It was hard not to cry then just as it is now.    InshaAllah, the situation for all the poor in this world will change soon. Allah hears our cries but still tests our endurance.

When he goes to the other room, unplug it and tell him you're trying to cut the bill down and he can't be on the wii all day.

And when your husband arrives, he can say, "Are you STILL here?" Don't make this guy too comfortable, or he'll be with you much longer, I'm afraid.

t0mb150gaa	Because you have made such an issue out of the word being used. It has gotten to the point that is a white person calls someone black they are being racist but you never hear us white people getting bent out of shape for being called white. You say the "n-word" is a sign of solidarity and brotherhood so it is funny that the meaning of that word changes when someone not black uses it. You tell everyone to stop whining and complaining about this issue but here you are doing that exact thing. Stop being double standard and maybe that word won't be taken so racist. Maybe us whites should make up words that have one meaning to us and call it racist when used by anyone else|`|RgymoiIQaa	It's not an issue for me. But I know a lot of white people who feel put off for not being "allowed" to say it. As you mentioned its a sign of brother hood and some white people want to feel that close to black people I guess. Personally, I am a lesbian. My gay friends joke and call me a fag*ut. But let a straight person call me a fag*ut and jokes over.|`|DWeGV8Akaa	true true ..|`|qvycijbOaa	I'm confused on that word and try to avoid at all costs but sometimes it slips out in the middle of a joke and i regret it (I am black by the way).

I dont know, they must really want to use it, but they like being able to taste their food so....    btw I never say that word, personally.|`|oOR511mFaa	Why are black brits using that word anyways?    Talawah, The Great.- I just noticed that this is Y!A UK and Ireland. I dont see why black brits (or anyone else) uses that word because the word was an insult used by white slave owners. Thats all.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	I think your rant is bullshit. I'm black and I don't use the word, nor do I see it as a term of endearment. If black people can be ignorant and say the word, so can anyone else. I can't stand hypocrites.|`|ecFH28Yyaa	Frankly, I don't think that the word should be used at all! It's an insult! There are some woman that go around call each other B words! That doesn't make it less offensive! Even though there is a silent agreement that when two people say the word it's not meant as a negative term doesn't mean the word is appropriate!|`|kHx1upOpaa	Because they want to still call us it. I wouldn't care if they called each other cracker. Its like when women call each other the b.... Its called false victimization to make them feel better about themselves.|`|c9b39ba1619a86eb939cf1b78c3d4a15aa	Because black people use it as a  term of endearment, and that is something they can obviously not be a part of.  They want us to stop using the word because it makes them uncomfortable, and they cannot use it in front of us so they rather we not use it. Oh well, ni99a ni99a ni99a i said it. lol|`|dyFRchmtaa	anyone can say it, it just matters how u use, it.. Im black myself, I think its ignorant hearing people say it all the time.. the same for ghetto language, but it does sound cool in urban music.. But i think its double standard to say whites cant used it    white people by more black music, than black people.. so i doubt white people dont say it while their singing along to kanye west..|`|4lHJEq5Haa	I don't get mad, I just think it sounds ignorant and juvenile.|`|OZjlW5utaa	BS! That word is derogatory and No one should say it! It doesn't phase me but I do get offended if someone calls me it, black or white or if I hear it. No self respecting person should use it unless they have a good reason or are using it to empathize.|`|mMm0INjfaa	no its not it has nothing to do with solidarity and brotherhood. I am black and i get offended when i hair other black call themselves ****** or *******...the word derive from slaves and what the white men use to call us bac in the day the word means ignorant and dumb do you really want to be called ignorant i dont think so...mayb you got your information or your understanding wrong but ****** or ***** is not a good word and no race should say it...|`|VpZ4QKn5aa	i said it once by accident and felt awful for it cos im not black.    yea i can totally understand that its 'ure thing' to address ya peeps like that.|`|V7iRigVJaa	I agree with Alex.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	I'm black, and I get mad when other blacks do it. It's not a sign or solidarity, it's a sign of stupidity. If you want to show solidarity, call each other brother like we always have.|`|VKz4OC3Laa	they get mad cuz they are jealous.....they wanna say it too because they wanna be like yall..just sayin|`|oYVxMmbQaa	Because they can't say it. They feel it's a double standard.    Never mind how I feel about the word (I hate it and don't say it), but I understand why some Blacks do say it. We took it back from it's intended meaning. When Black people address each other with that term, it means something COMPLETELY different than what it does to non-Black people.
OiAl6w48aa	Because the government doesn't like being deprived of tax revenue and big companies don't like to give up consumers without a fight.|`|a172ded814c17e4957eba16acd8888d7aa	thou shall not kill|`|AA10873763	Probably for the same reason it's illegal to be in a car without a seatbelt or on a motorcycle without a helmet.  The government wants to babysit us.  A failed suicide attempt, like an unprotected vehicle accident, potentially puts a burden on society to care for an incapacitated person.   I think it BS, personally.|`|HMOIB7Mtaa	last time i checked, it wasn't illegal in any criminal code i'd seen|`|WF085j2Daa	I believe the laws making it so were repealed in most of the civalised countries many years ago, so you either live in amerca which is xtian or one of the moslem countries which are unfortunate.|`|hcu9wBFmaa	It's not illegal is it? My sister attempted suicide and it's not like they tried arresting her for it. They just gave her anti-depressants.     It would be pointless making it illegal, I agree with you.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Suicide is caused by mental illness those people need to be taken care of by doctors, they are rarely jailed for the crime.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	I guess it's to deter anyone from trying, lest they fail and are prosecuted (it CAN be quite hard to kill one's self effectively).|`|KrTkyc9Faa	I think everyone who commits suicide should be arrested and given the death penalty.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	attempted suicide is illegal. The reason is that that way if Police find out someone is trying to commit suicide they can stop them and take them to a hospital. If it weren't illegal they wouldnt be able to do anything.    Its not pointless at all, its actually very very important. It allows the police to HELP them.|`|JqHkgWROaa	Because those who fail at committing it cause tax payers a bunch of money.    A: If your going to commit suicide; do it the right way, and do it in a manner where it doesnt take a ton of public service people to clean up the mess. Don't make it a 3 hour closure of some bridge for you to eventually step down from the damn thing.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Assisted suicide "today" is illegal because of the number of those that have attempted it and had survived.....later regret it.      I personally think that those will late stage of terminal illnesses should be allowed to decide when they want to go instead of living the rest of their life in physical pain.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Actually, suicide itself was once deemed "illegal". I suspect it still is in many places, though the existing laws are being struck down left and right.    Nothing at all to do with morals, though. Sorry all you self-righteous church folk.    It's all about "the money". Since insurance companies have payout exclusions for criminal activity, they were the ones who pushed for formal illegalization.    Modern insurance has been forced to recognize the true "human condition", however, and now offer time-tiered payouts for suicide. This protects people who have played the game most of their life and have come to a brick wall, while also protecting insurance companies from quick-turnover abuse.    "Attempted suicide" also isn't "illegal" per se. Although under certain conditions an attempted suicide can be used by the state to take control of your welfare ("ward of the state") and have you forcibly institutionalized for treatment.|`|AA11703455	It is one of those "it sounds good to me" laws that only politicians can come up with.     Now, the "assisted suicide" laws might have meat to them, though on the level of man-slaughter, rather than first degree murder. If you are helping your old mum out of the world to collect her property, the state has an interest in cutting that out.|`|Iva8drdfaa	WRONG    Suicide isn't illegal.      ATTEMPTED suicide is Illegal.|`|wzU9VUt2aa	Yea, would seem kind of...pointless.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Suicide is not illegal. It is immoral. They wont try and take you to jail for attempting suicide they will put you in the psych ward for it.|`|opjgggqnaa	Is attempting suicide technically illegal?  I don't think anyone has been officially charged for a crime have they?  Is it really illegal then if nobody is ever brought up on charges?|`|UD7d70awaa	It's not attempting suicide is.|`|MQBKnbSFaa	Yes it is. In some states the penalty is death. But the government wants to do something to prevent suicides.

Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law.   Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide.|`|4LYasBGXaa	whether we are talking about the us or the uk- the theory comes from teh same common law presumption and law philosophy.    basically the law holds life to be the most sacred of things-    so therefore any person who is contemplating or attempting to take thier OWN life, must not be thinking clearly and must be mentally unbalanced.    thus it is a crime becasue it is inconceivable under the law (which comes from the same basic western european source in us and uk) that a person would want to end or destroy that which is precious to them. namely thier OWN life.    EDIT:     as for your word-play on suicide and attempted suicide- thats actually a fun brain-teaser riddle to ask people- people aren't usually going to get it becasue it is the kind of thing that is so simplistic it borders on stupidity-    ask: "what kind of crime can you be prosecuted for if you attempt it, but not if you complete it".    EDIT2: "suicide" charges are struck down because it is the same as charging a corpse with grand larceny- what are they going to do throw your rotting carcas into a jail cell or give it probation? your coffin can't leave the state for 5 years?    "ASSISTED suicide" is not the issue here because those people are charged with some form of murder. except in the case of assisting a scientologist with killing itself then it is animal cruelty.|`|AA11104965	Suicide is illegal because our government does not believe that people have a 'right to life.'

Can you bring anyone back to life and put them in jail?    Now it is different if they attempt. Now they can be confined in a institution. For safety sake.    I would think it would be to late. God said do not be concerned with the body after death.But after one can do no more be concerned with the one that can cast that soul in hell. What is the fear of God?    THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM.

Jumping off of a bridge (traffic)    If you are dead set on killing yourself you can do it without harming anyone else.  Most people hesitate and wait for an audience to talk them down from doing it.  If they make it illegal (which they did) you can now take this step a little more serious.  You will either kill yourself very fast without an audience and does it matter if it's illegal then?  Or you will be arrested for possible harm to others or disturbing the peace in general.

fb7ff06e84dd7a20f48e489ef758444eaa	I questioned my uncle (a preacher) about this as well. Here's what he had to say:    "I believe that Jesus and God were two separate beings."    I understand how anyone can come to the conclusion that Jesus and God are two separate beings.   In fact, when you read the Bible it seems like The Old Testament is about God and the New Testament is about Jesus. So it only makes sense to think of them as two separate beings. God the Father  and Jesus the Son. But in the Bible - Jesus says in John 10:30 "I and the Father are one." and in John 17:22, Jesus says, "I have given them the glory that you gave me that they may be one as we are one."  So the Bible teaches that Jesus and God are one person with two separate roles.  Just as you are a "daughter" but are also my "niece". You are one person in two separate roles but there is only one you.                 In the physical world - an egg is a good example of The Trinity  The egg exists as a shell / the white / and the yolk  - they can be  observed and experienced separately but all three as one make up an egg.    So, the Bible is teaching us about God the Father, and God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit who are one and the same. So, because God and Jesus are essentially the same being but  portrayed as separate personalities. It was Jesus the God/man who died for our sins so it really wasn't like God sent the son to do the dirty work it was God (the being) through the personality(role) of the son.  Listen, I know this sounds like I'm doing a play on words. But I have a really great book called "The Case for Faith" written by a journalist named Lee Strobel who set out to prove that Christianity could not stand up to hard journalistic questions.     (I'm currently reading this book and it seems like a good one.-AV)|`|e4297ce7d4edce32f4278ebbd2408c39aa	The Divine Trinity is not a philosophy  but a truth.  I think this is a very good question but be careful of the answers you get from others.  It's a good idea anytime you have questions about the Bible to get evidence as you requested by asking where you can find it for yourself.  The very first evidence of the trinity can be found in Gen 1:1-3.  You'll find it again in the scripture Gen 1 verse 26 when God says let US make man in  OUR image, according to OUR likeness..... If God was indeed one then there would be no reference to US and OUR it would simply state MY instead.  You can also read these scriptures that refer to the trinity, 2 Cor. 13:14, Eph. 1:4, 7, 13.  There are several others in the Old and New Testament and I can send them to you if you want.  And as far as the response to Jesus being impure that it also untrue.  Jesus was born in the most purest form, through a virgin.  He never committed a sin, and there was no wrong doings found against him before his crucifixation.  Simply saying, Jesus left the throne to die for the sins of His children.  But through his defeating death through the resurrection, we now can have everlasting life.  When Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden, death entered the world.  There was no one perfect enough to defeat death, but the Son.  Its an amazing subject and I can't say all that I've been given through the Holy Spirit and through studying in this post,  but if you have any questions or comments, I'll be more than glad to share my beliefs with you.|`|cd7f839170e2d8854ae17679d5b41bffaa	This is not a question that can answered in just a few words...    GOD - HIS EXISTENCE      1.    Taken for Granted by the Scripture Writers    It does not seem to have occurred to any of the writers of either the Old or the New Testaments to attempt to prove or to argue for the existence of God. Everywhere and at all times it is a fact taken for granted. A God capable of proof would be no God at all (Jacobi). He is the self-existent One (Exod. 3:14) and the Source of all life (John 5:26).    The sublime opening of the Scriptures announces the fact of God and His existence: In the beginning God (Gen. 1:1). Nor is the rise or dawn of the idea of God in the mind of man depicted. Psa. 14:1: The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God, indicates not a disbelief in the existence, but rather in the active interest of God in the affairs of menHe seemed to hide Himself from the affairs of men (see Job 22:12-14).    The Scriptures further recognize that men not only know of the existence of God, but have also a certain circle of ideas as to who and what He is (Rom. 1:18, 19).    No one but a fool will deny the fact of God. What! no God? A watch, and no key for it? A watch with a main-spring broken, and no jeweler to fix it? A watch, and no repair shop? A timecard and a train, and nobody to run it? A lamp lit, and nobody to pour oil in to keep the wick burning? A garden, and no gardener? Flowers, and no florist? Conditions, and no conditioner? He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh at such absurd atheism.  THE NATURE OF GOD (Vs. Agnosticism)      1.    The Spirituality of God (Vs. Materialism) God Is Spirit.      a)    STATEMENT OF THE FACT, JOHN 4:24: GOD IS SPIRIT.    Meaning: The Samaritan womans question, Where is God to be found? etc. On Mt. Zion or Gerizim? Christs answer: God is not to be confined to any one place (cf. Acts 7:48; 17:25; 1 Kings 8:27). God must be worshipped in spirit as distinguished from place, form, or other sensual limitations (John 4:21); and in truth as distinguished from false conceptions resulting from imperfect knowledge (4:22).  THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD    It is difficult to clearly distinguish between the attributes and the nature of God. It is maintained by some that such a division ought not to be made; that these qualities of God which we call attributes are in reality part of His nature and essence. Whether this be exactly so or not, our purpose in speaking of the attributes of God is for convenience in the study of the doctrine of God.    It has been customary to divide the attributes of God into two classes: the natural, and the moral. The natural attributes are omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, eternity; the moral attributes: holiness, righteousness, faithfulness, mercy and loving-kindness, and love.    The Person of Christ    The close kinship of Christ with Christianity is one of the distinctive features of the Christian religion. If you take away the name of Buddha from Buddhism and remove the personal revealer entirely from his system; if you take away the personality of Muhammad from Muhammadanism, or the personality of Zoroaster from the religion of the Parsees, the entire doctrine of these religions would still be left intact. Their practical value, such as it is, would not be imperilled or lessened. But take away from Christianity the name and person of Jesus Christ and what have you left? Nothing! The whole substance and strength of the Christian faith centres in Jesus Christ. Without Him there is absolutely nothing.Sinclair Patterson.    From beginning to end, in all its various phases and aspects and elements, the Christian faith and life is determined by the person and the work of Jesus Christ. It owes its life and character at every point to Him. Its convictions are convictions about Him. Its hopes are hopes which He has inspired and which it is for Him to fulfill. Its ideals are born of His teaching and His life. Its strength is the strength of His spirit.  The Scriptures Distinctly Teach that He had a Human Parentage: That He Was Born of a WomanThe Virgin Mary.    Matt. 1:18Mary was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 2:11The young child with Mary his mother. 12:47Behold, thy mother and thy brethren. 13:55Is not his mother called Mary? John 1:14The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. 2:1The mother of Jesus was there. Acts 13:23Of this mans seed hath God raised Jesus. Rom. 1:3Of the seed of David according to the flesh. Gal. 4:4Made of a woman.    In thus being born of a woman Jesus Christ submitted to the conditions of a human life and a human body; became humanitys son by a human birth. Of the seed of the woman, of the seed of Abraham, and of line and lineage of David, Jesus Christ is undeniably human.    We must not lose sight of the fact that there was something supernatural surrounding the birth of the Christ. Matt. 1:18On this wise, and Luke 1:35The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. On this wise indicates that this birth was different from those recorded before it. Luke 1:35 is explicit about the matter. To assail the virgin birth is to assail the Virgins life. He was of the seed of the woman, not of the man. (See Luke 1:34How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?) No laws of heredity are sufficient to account for His generation. By a creative act God broke through the chain of human generation and brought into the world a supernatural being.    The narrative of the virgin birth need not stagger us. The abundance of historical evidence in its favor should lead to its acceptan|`|26896be25b9fe83bcef7859a07b98f01aa	In Roman Catholicism, what you are asking about is known as "Trinitarian Theology."  The short answer is that "God" is three persons, each unique in character, yet one and the same.      Longer answer... there is only one God, but God the Father (the God of the Old Testament) is the creator.  Jesus is the son of God, human and divine (a question for another day) who is the incarnation of God.  Some will say the "self-realization on the categorical plane" of God the Father, who is transcendental.  The Holy Spirit is often named "the advocate" or "the spirit" of God.    You will not find Trinitarian Theology in the Bible... this is a theology that developed in the early centuries of the church and they struggled to understand their experience of God, the meaning of Jesus, the relationship between them, etc.    NOTE - this is considered a mystery (and I don't mean the Perry Mason kind) and cannot be imperically explained by science.  So no, this will not make logical sense.  It is something that you have to either be willing to just accept and move on or buckle down and do some serious theological and philosophical study/research/thought.|`|AA12128114	don't fu*k with a don?|`|AA10027931	Matthew 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

The understanding of this does not come very easily.  It has come through a divine revelation.    God is all powerful, he is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. He is everywhere all at the same time and he can show himself in any form he pleases.    I will try to explain it like this.  My name is Kim and I perform many functions.  I AM SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER, I AM SOMEBODY'S SISTER and I AM SOMEBODY'S NIECE.  That doesn't mean that I am three different persons! I am one person serving many functions.  It is the same with God, he is one person and he chose to show himself in three different functions.    The FATHER is God the spirit. (the bible says that God is a spirit)  The SON speaks of God in the flesh, and his name is Jesus (to redeem man he had to put on flesh in order to shed blood to save us, spirit cannot shed blood)  The HOLYGHOST is the spirit of God. (when he left earth he told his disciples since I am going away and won't be with you in the flesh any more I will send the comforter, that is the spirit side of him, to be with us; he is no longer here in the flesh, he is here in the spirit)    Also we must realize that the name of the Father is Jesus, the name of the Son is Jesus and the name of the Holy Ghost is Jesus.

Also, there's a passage where Jesus tells his followers that he has to leave so that the "helper" can come - which is the spirit.

aGRJ6MPdaa	It just changed starting this year. I'm not 100% sure of the order, but after an opening song from their own song book and a prayer, they have their "ministry school", which is where they practice what to say to people at the doorstep and how to circumvent comments from people who disagree or who don't want to talk to them.     Then they have their "congregation book study" which they now call the "congregation Bible study", even though they aren't studying the Bible at all (and never have)! They always study one of their own publications which is nothing more than a commentary on their interpretation of the Bible.    Then they have another song followed by announcements. These announcements include naming those who should be shunned because they have left the cult. They announced my family and I last week. You should see how they react when they see us. It is quite a tragic sight to behold. After fighting off the urge to smile and wave, most of them turn away quickly or look to the floor, probably due to the fact that deep down they know it is un- Christian to shun us like that when they know perfectly well that we did nothing wrong!    Anyway, after the announcements, they have their "service meeting", which is outlined in their private newsletter called "Our Kingdom Ministry". This meeting discusses the more intimate goings- on in the organization, with a focus on their preaching and expansion efforts. They even have more in- depth discussions of the Governing Body's interpretation of the Bible with a "quiz" every few months to make sure everyone is staying properly brainwas- er, I mean, indoctrinated.     After that there's another song and prayer, followed by elbow- rubbing and butt- kissing.     I might be mistaken about the order of things. The book study might be after the announcements, I'm not sure. I think this is right, though.|`|W3ptH1JCaa	Most importantly, this is the meeting where disfellowshipping announcements are made, and the shunning process begins. Interestingly, their announcement was changed a couple years back in order to avoid more lawsuits.     Now they simply say "so-and-so is no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses", instead of saying whether that person was disfellowshipped or disassociated themselves. This is good for their morale, since more people are leaving of their own free will than are being kicked out.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	I want to know, too. There is a Kingdom Hall 10 mins. away. I think it's called a public speaking class or something.  I will be watching for your answers.  I wonder how  it goes on sundays, too.|`|9Dq2176oaa	Typically "Tuesday Night meetings" go like this  Song  Prayer  Book Study  Bible study  Bible school  Song Prayer  Announcements   Article Study  Song   Prayer      Bookstudy (which is no longer conduct, but, put into our "tuesday night")  Was a small gathering where a disscussion on a bible based publication was discussed in detail using the bible.  But this arrangement is no longer available. Now, you will have to attend the Kingdom Hall meetings.|`|HTXsEms9aa	orgy  maybe............har har har  maybe they get naked under their clothes  maybe they play twiddles winks  no don't you do it don't you dare don't you delete this answer  you better not I mean it if you do you will be sorry  just try me oh noooooooooooooooo noooooooooooooooooo  you did it darn you I warned you nooooooooooooooo
K6fasl6kaa	whatever blend of genes from the parents surfaces.  all babies are beautiful.|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	IDK, but I do know that you may need to change your thoughtsa of what beauty really is.|`|hkvWDU3xaa	your baby will look like a baby mixed with White and Black. Besides that your boyfriend probably looks white because he IS latino and Latinos have alot of White in them. After all The Spanish Conquistadors (Conquerers)(who are a white race) who came over from Spain they integrated with the Natives of the Latino countries that they took over and forced them to live by their laws.

vheLCVFmaa	It is Polish  It means, I love you  I think
ea4WciVvaa	I think there is nothing wrong with not knowing spanish being a latina or latino. I can speak spanish and english , spanish was my first language but i rarely speak it now . Its nice to know it though because sometimes it comes in handy but other than those odd times i run into someone that doesnt speak a word of english , theres nothing wrong with just speaking english. its not bad ;)    *** P .S   Its nice to put bilingual on your resume though.. lol|`|L1HVLylMaa	It is like a beautiful girl with only one leg|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	I would think it no different than any one else who speaks only English if they are Americans. I myself don't know a lick of German|`|vkeuaEHiaa	There's nothing wrong with having a heritage but not being able to speak it. there's no real reason to learn Spanish if you live in America unless you are pursuing a career that involves Spanish. I'm Italian but I don't know how to speak it.
b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	You cannot go to heaven going against what God has created.  If they die without having truly repented (repent doesn't mean i'm sorry, it means to change your mind about the situation AND to be sorry you ever did it), they will go to hell when they die.|`|KnZ0FpkFaa	He made that person a specific way as a test.  TO OTHER PEOPLE!!!    he was trying to get them to tolerate and be more friendly, instead of being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.  Its an agree to disagree but still be good friends kind of lesson.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	A soul has no gender but a character or nature.|`|Wr09qsYMaa	Why would God feel anyhthing? You are associating pety human emotions with something that supposedly created the universe. Cmon you are smarter than that. Notice how the bible depicts God as jealous, angry, loving, etc. These are all human emotions. Its like saying we have the same emotions as a bacteria. Lets get real. If there is a God he doesnt give a **** about trannies. Trannies are cool, and if there were a God, a Christian God, there would be no trannies at all. Long live the crying game|`|BNHocZaiaa	Unfortunately, his followers believe he is intolerant, hence they are intolerant.|`|7S0ore8Caa	He would be very disappointed. He made you a boy/girl for a reason.  You shouldn't change that.|`|tg9Wj5Bpaa	God tests us in our own ways.    By that i mean, maybe God wanted them to realize that they identified as the opposite gender.  as people evolve and grow, doesn't God also?  I bet she is fascinated by the people that have gender reassignment surgery.      I am all for transgender people doing what they think is right for THEIR body!|`|qMf2SaYQaa	Well since there is no "God", it doesn't really matter.|`|0JE41mXsaa	God Loves all of His Creations.      To wit - He provided us with a "handbook" or "manual" on how to get closer to Him.  Cross-dressing as a lifestyle, typically has the connotation of sinful behavior e.g. sex outside of marriage, drug use, homosexuality, etc.     (I'm positive that not all the examples cited above apply in all cases!)    We called to perfection, as this brings us closer to God.  Matthew 5:48: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."  i.e. the freedom of choice that we have as individuals - irrespective of our inclinations - will either bring us to freedom or to bondage to sin.|`|E0uRBwWtaa	"Ew"? You're very immature. Some people are born with them.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Which hypothetical god are you thinking of?    There are thousands to choose from and anyone can make up more.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|IqqaA2wIaa	He is disgusted....its wrong....we should be grateful for the life we are given...|`|DQjAGWXQaa	You suppose that god exists, and that he made everything as it should be. Then wouldn't he also have made the mentality of transsexuals?|`|UujliMsCaa	How does God feel about them? He loves them, just like he loves all of us. God is love. Sin is death. Making that distinction first is paramount.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	He would say, "That poor, confused girl. Can't she see the organs I gave her?"     Personally, if God were to take away my female organs and give me male ones, without changing my personality or feelings, I would say, "Well, looks like I've got a p e n i s and testicles now. Time to go after women." It's that simple.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	The assumptions themselves make no sense.    Learn as much as you can about reproduction and human development both physical, and psychological.    Read some more adult and open minded books about theology.    Remember: NOBODY KNOWS what "God thinks".    re: Additional Details.  All humans start as female in the earliest stage.  Genes cause Hormones which affect the growth and development of the reproductive organs and the brain.     If you have gender identity questions find someone you can trust to talk to.  Good Luck|`|AA11987172	If "god" made them like that, it was his decision...|`|N3BXYCYUaa	When you die and meet god how about you ask him?|`|iX0CoNkXaa	Amen!    Romans 1:28   "And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient"|`|9XAqnmOQaa	What if you show up with a tattoo?|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Nothing. He doesn't exist!|`|8tF9Py9Daa	God would think you're being incredibly simple.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	God apparently loves all his children., so that means he loves transgendered people..    Anyone who disagrees with this statement.. disagrees with "gods word".|`|pW9KhTFvaa	I am pretty sure that the Christian God, as I remember, loves everyone.  For us to wonder, or even care what he would think about someone else's decision is a sin.  Judge not, lest ye be judged.
e3NKl6Chaa	You can name your kids whatever you want. I have a suggestion though: you should name your daughter "Isabella" instead of Bella cos that's not really a name in itself. In Italian, it means beautiful and some may find it weird.|`|qQu57aWdaa	i love those names.  and isabella yes then you can nickname her bella or bell   because bella is short for isabella. but either way itss goooooood.|`|d3YToW4Aaa	nooo.i'm black and my name is latin and my middle name is english.my grandma is black and her names are hebrew,persian,and arab(1st middle and last name-lol)....beyonce is black and ghetto but her name is french and no one has a problem|`|RuiCdL5Aaa	no but its just weird and you look like a wannabe cultural person|`|OtgLLpn5aa	Name them George and Isabelle if you feel uncomfortable.  But, I wouldn't have a problem with those names...
AA12147343	Religion by definition is faith. Without faith religion is simply words. However, science is often based on theory and it is to prove the theory to be fact is what spurs on the scientist and researcher. Often they find that they are proving religious belief to be correct. Archeology is our best example. Many of the places in the Bible were considered myth until ruins were dug up in the desert.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	There is and its called Humanism, which as I understand it is a search for a natural social order without an God creating the rules. Of course it would have to ignore the possibility of a dimension which may be out of the realm of the physical. Like anything else it would run the risk of being proven right or wrong.|`|AA10451912	There is no need for religion in that case.  Tammi Dee|`|ce394cc3237a1b9e9ba8b97e22c195dfaa	Actually, with the megatons of evidence that scientists have gathered, I'm sure it would be VERY difficult to disprove science.|`|AA10797215	A science-based religion is a self-contradictory idea. Science results from careful observation and repeatable testing under specifiable conditions. Religion is a matter of faith, of physically untestable theories.|`|AA10066367	Not really, you would still have to have faith in Science wouldn't you?|`|7c53db50473719d5ce5cac583eca7ffeaa	A religion based on science would be kind of dull, since religion is about answering the big questions, and science is modest enough to acknowledge it doesn't have an answer for everything.|`|3300214feddc0ce2edbe758a5e6c8fb1aa	then you'd have the first intelligent cult on earth.|`|161ccae8b68ccac64375b35741be0cb9aa	Yes, but religions that run on faith can be scientifically proved wrong as well.  But I see what you are saying.  If a scientific religion with scientific-minded members was proved wrong, it would fall apart.  If a faith-based religion was scientifically proved wrong it could still survive because its members would be brainwashed and indoctrinated.  How else could religions like Christianity survive through the ages?|`|fdae2db8c1949234eabb30a2f60818ccaa	I don't think so... If it was based on science, then it would change as our understanding of science changed. For a religion not based on faith, try Deism!|`|3922b4013e611a76c39940b0895356f2aa	Druid, Tianic and Ricci are all scientifically based faiths. They all have medicinal, herbal,Metallurgic and other similar sciences at their roots.|`|AA11579751	If its science ... its not religion anymore ....     Thousand years ago , people used to think that the rain were the tears of God ... it was religion , because they don't understand it.  Once they understand how the rain is made , its science .    so religion is an explication of something that you don't know. and when you will understand it , it wont be religion anymore.It a science.(Every theory must follow the scientific method to became valid as Science ).    I don't think that we will know everything in the universe , we won't find the absolute truth ...That's why there will be always"Religion "  however,i am sure that we will answer billions of question , and what is concerning religion today , will be considered as scientific fact in the future .

fxzjgUKCaa	What would you do, If you have family and the big wish of having everything for them, but It is imposible because the own goverment limits you to have a descent life?.  Inmigration is not something new, and this country has been made of Inmigrants.  If We were solid as one human being as your anti_inmigrant comments, trust me, that this country would be the best example for the rest of the humanity, but unfortunally, we have a President that is just focus in killing instead teach his oun people to be better humans!.  It is a lot of bad people out there I know, but bealive me. i am a legal inmigrant that would give my life for this country, it has given me so much happines that i can give my opinion to you and anyone How beatifull this country is!  Man.... you are lucky of having everything (schools,a car, a job or even simpler a glass of clean water anytime you are thirsty) you should enjoy it instead of thinking how much you can lost. It a waste of time, from the bottom of my heart, share more and you will get more back... It is call KARMA or whatever concept works for you!

I think everyone complaining about them, needs to realize that were in the year 2007, and immigrants have been coming all over the world for years and years now, and they need to accept that people come here for better lives and opportunities, or simply trying to find a better life and leave stuff behind. I think many people don't realize that here in America, we have a lot of chances, and many advantages to live peaceful and safe lives, and have a good dependable job at least, but imagine if you weren't living in a country like this. It would be reasonable for you to want to go somewhere with more freedom and opportunities.     I don't think our country would be the same.|`|AA12148794	Yes. The last thing America needs right now is illegal citizens leeching off of our welfare.|`|c33b73b06f1fe17127c084ed086b73fdaa	To be honest yes, cause you know the most of the Illegal Immigrants were caught smuggling drugs into the United States.|`|9c664f10eb3e6ce103117183298a3179aa	Think? I gave up thinking about things i really don't understand. Hell, I don;t understand why my F150 is dripping oil around all the seals so I am paying $2500 to rebuild the 4.9 l six and hope i am lucky. But it takes luck. Who can you trust? Live with risk and try not to let the risk get you down. May bet lucky? How is that like deciding whether we weould be better off without illegal immigrants? Well, I am not omniscient, I barely am sure if i am buying the best kind of toilet paper that doesn't give me a rash. Immigrants, beats the hell out of me. I do know some things. I know I like being with my own kind. You know, likea tribe or a community where trust is a little higher. Speak the same language and understand all the the little inuendos and subtle phrases that makes life richer. Immigrants work hard, i guess, they need to work and money but i now see they aren't just coming here  to be farm workers. They compete with my son who spent a long time learning to be a good journyman electrictian. They haeve doctors and dentists and good programmers coming over and competing and lowering the income for traditiional americans. is that good? if so, for who? but i know dfamn near nothing.

tKhatP8naa	Yea, you should just go to the mall and eat dinner there (if they have nice restaurants in your malls) then just go back to your house and party! :D go swimming in your hot tub. before the day or your slumber party you could take a friend with you and have her help you pick out some movies for your party to watch. then go to the store and buy a huge thing of ice cream and all kinds of toppings for it, so when you come home from the mall and everything you guys can make your own sundaes. its really fun thats what i did for my 14th (last year) just have fun and dont plan out every little detail because its not going to work out trust me. just go with the flow and if things start to get boring just start acting crazy or go outside and play hide and go seek in the dark (its fun even though it sounds stupid) Good luck and happy birthday ;D|`|IHsuI8mJaa	Do a formal dinner! Like reallllllllly dressed up!! High heels and all. Like if you have a nice basement set up a nice decorated table. With really pretty plates and stuff, and drink out of wine classes! Have your mom make like a fancy italian dinner for you girls. (Tell her she can't come down though- it just you and your gals!) Or even better just have her drop you guys off at Olive Garden or something and have her pick you up when its time to pay the bill! :] Then go back to your house and have a scary movie night! ? Have fun!
3sHjhMgxaa	The overall mature opinion is that they were very important in founding and building the country and state, and still are.   They are just like any other nationality culture here. We are made up from europeans mainly anyway. Missunderstood at first and discriminated against but now accepted as an important aspect of america.    Charactor wise i think from those ive met and know - proud, rebellious, funny seem to laugh at themselves alot, sceptic, mystical (not just the myths etc) but in the way they look at things, faithful to religion but can disriminate against religious minorities, outgoing, dilligent yet lazy when off! , know who they are. Generous.    My opinion they're alrite pretty cool.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Barefooted Colleens dancing on every crossroads.  Little people.  Pigs in the Parlour.

Alright the drinking part is slightly true...  I know not all think that way, any Americans that have bothered to learn about other countries wouldn't have that opinion.  It's a pain in the **** when someone asks on the ireland section : Are there any leprechauns in ireland? or is ireland in scotland?    Also irish accents are NOT sexy, you wouldn't think that if you were unfortunate enough to hear a thick dublin accent.
aHLnNrOGaa	I see and also thought what you meant.  I was somewhat disappointed with the first half.  The characters seemed more like caricatures.    However they had to get a lot done in such a short period of time.  We not only had to learn about them and their lives.  We also had to learn of Bobby's being gay and trying to blend that with his family.    Next we had his death and the family dealing with that.    Also Mary, the mother also had to do a complete & complex 180 in her bigoted views on homosexuality and the truth.  (Which I feel they did a good job showing).    Keep in mind this was also only from the point of view of the living and what they got from Bobby's journals.    All in all it was a good movie though.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	I liked the whole movie, especially when bobby moved out|`|GJFBsG62aa	The point of the movie was not to dwell on his important moments about when he was happy(like when he was David, or his cousin in Portland) but the times of trail with his mother when she said those nasty comments about homosexuality. It was those remarks that built the foundation for the movie, being when he killed himself; tired and unable any longer to cope with the pain.|`|AA10665732	I think the idea of the movie was to focus more on the negatives of what happens to people who are not accepted by the people they care for most. Not so much of the story being focused on Bobby but the change in the Mom.    To send a message that everyone should be accepted.|`|EK7mJWPZaa	i totally agree with you but you know maybe they wanted to stick to the facts of what really happened and they really dont know what went through bobby's head and they probably dont know half of the things that went on with him and david....so maybe they didnt wanna ad to much B.S. to the actual story because they didnt know....idk....just a thought|`|3yNvJ30jaa	OMG I WANNA SEE THAT MOVIE.
2R3iJnFPaa	I haven't but I think it's possible.|`|8G42oyydaa	Certainly but its sooo hard to trust again. Mine always had a presence on dating sites and chat sites throughout the relationship, and a few spares in the closet just in case.     I have since learned he is a habitual cheater and probably a sex addict.    HOW do you trust again? You have to take people at face value, and believe they are honest and are who they present themselves to be. After my experience I cant do that.     I dont trust my judgement anymore.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Yes, I have loved and lost and waited a long time to love again. . . but yes it is possible !  If you push love out of your life, how can you be happy ? ?  I was divorced for 30 yrs.before I found someone else I would even remotely want to have a relationship with. . . I knew he would have to be special for that to happen. . . believe me there are still nice ones out there. . . just keep your heart open. . .|`|a4LWildhaa	I have. Lost the second time as well. Doubt very much it will happen again, I think I've been fortunate.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	I have and its possible.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Yes, absolutely.  I have never forgotten the first and never will but life moves on and to be truly good for myself and my family I had to be open to change as well.  Easy? Heck no. Possible-yes. Probable if one can get past the trust issues that others may have dumped on you.  Well worth it though.|`|nwnILcEAaa	No, once was enough.|`|acaJSqW6aa	Yes I have loved and lost, and loved and lost, and loved and lost, and loved and lost .. and I'm going to try this routine one more time if I ever get the chance.|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	Patsy Cline, Did|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Nothing is as devastating, as losing or turning loose your first love,  due to a falling out, a betrayal or an infidelity. You learn from that  experience as much as any other failure in life. That's how we grow  and become wiser for it. There should always be that plan to fall in   love. It should not be a matter of how but when. Sometimes it takes  more than a couple of failures at loving someone, before we find the  right someone, who loves us back. There's no mistaking who your  perfect soul mate will be. You will see a bonding early and feel the  chemistry of bonding. And you never seem to be looking for anything,  when the realization, hits you, that this has got to be true love. I  don't think you can't fully know, when it's the person who will matter  the most in your lifetime. But it's up to you, how you help to manage  the relationship.  To allow it to progress to a wedding ring, or some  other committment. Sometimes, people have the need to become  friends first. Getting to know the other person, and their moods and  interests, and how they think, before allowing yourself to get totally  involved with them. Some say a marriage will outlast any other, if you  do become long standing friends first. And aren't merely attracted to  a lustful relationship. Sometimes people can mislead themselves,  thinking that a srong lustful attraction is love. But that burns itself  out soon enough. And when that subsides, there has to be somethng  more concrete to stabilize a union of both souls and minds. Some  people are exceedinly lucky to forge a bond with the first person they find attractive and is truly into them and visa versa. But no relationship  should be drawn up hastily. Always plan to be absolutely sure of  the person you want to be engaged to. And make sure you have  several reasons for marrying and not just physical. As down the road,  you will need to be able to reach out to the person they are inside.  And when two hearts bond as one, there's no denying you're in a  loving and being loved state. Life is complete at that junction. And  life has fulfilled you, to live in a state of harmony with the mate you  have chosen. And he has chosen you. You can overcome any ob-  sacle from that time foward, if you always have love to keep you  together forever more.|`|klfvmIEXaa	ive loved and lost,but got two great sons out of it.  but after 37yrs.have never met anyone i could live with full time|`|JIATcwW6aa	Yes I have.  After 27 years of marriage, I never thought I could love again.  I did, lost again...but never say never.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Yes . . . . divorced after 25 years of marriage . . . .     I'm now loving (and living with) a Cuban-American woman and we are very good for each other.    We dance more than we ever did . . . .laugh more than we ever did . . . and I do love her.      Dan in Miami|`|VWAl3tcnaa	Yes but I have not found it again even after remarrying.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Absolutely.    Every love is different, of course.  At first, you might not recognise it, especially if recovering from a broken heart.  But I have come through heartbreak to be, a few years later, engaged to someone wonderful, and believe that so can anyone who chooses to try.|`|uOVepBl8aa	Yes I think Its totally possible.    Its just that when you fall in love again, you may be skeptical about it and that may affect how you feel about the person- what I mean is that you may start to remember what went wrong in your last relationship (or the last time you fell in love) and then you'll start to think the same things will just happen again and it may feel like you dont really love that new person, when in reality its just your mind being pessimistic and clouding your feelings.    Also if you arent completely "over" the last person you fell in love with then you may start to compare your new love interest with your ex.   It could also work conversely- as in, your new love may remind you of certain qualities that your ex had and it will make you feel more close to them, like you've known them forever/ they are your match.    But overall I do think its possible to fall in love again. I believe that some people fall in love multiple times in their lifetime, but sometimes the person whom they fall in love with just arent they're perfect match (soulmate) so they move on until they find the right one (if they can.)|`|bDPU6qWiaa	yes,it takes time for wounds to heal but i found a wonderful man and i am in love again|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	I think this is a very personal question. Some people may be able to do it, others not. There is no wrong and no right answer. All you can do is jump in with both feet and hope you land on soft sand rather than rocks. But keep your eyes open when you are jumping.|`|OXuhjS0jaa	I lose all the time, but that doesn't stop my loving others. I only hope they love me sooner or later.      Forgive others as I have forgiven you.|`|khJBfboRaa	Yes, I loved my husband for 24 years and then it all ended in tears (for me).  I spent 3 years alone and then I met a man and fell for him "hook line and sinker".  Sadly, after 14 years, that has also ended.  I am now resigned to being alone and quite philosophical about it.|`|AA10565336	For me, only the first two.    I am satisfied in my marriage of nearly 40 years but...

zYYrdg44aa	If theirs no future regarding the relationship then basically it was simply simmilar to a one night stand for the man:(    Leave him defonitly, if you do decide to stay with him then just remember its a temporary thing, and plan to leave him in the future when your more serious.    It's up to yourself really , are u looking for something serious? then I suggest that you leave him.    In future when you start any relationship discuss what you are looking for before hand a long term relationship possibly leading to marriage, if both are looking for the same thing then give it a go, and if not then its not worth it.|`|AA10381258	Neither of the answers you offer. My opinion is that marriage is simply a piece of paper. If you have a good relationship, then leave it alone and be happy.|`|ceeNqETqaa	How long is long?    Personally, I'd show him the door, well I'd like to think I would.    That's quite disrepsectful.|`|Nk1CiR0Vaa	Have you found out his reasons for not wanting to marry you?  I don't think it's fair to leave him without discussing this properly with him. It may be that he has been married in the past and has had a bad experience and would rather just keep your relationship how it is, if it's going well. I think that you should only leave him if his reason for refusing to marry you is because he 'doesn't love you enough' or if he's 'planning on leaving you and doesn't want the hassle of a divorce'.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Would I leave him or would I show him the door?  It pretty much amounts to the same thing doesn't it?|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Well, if you are really in love you wouldn't need the state and/or church to sanction your love.  And at my age if the relationship is good, the married part would be pretty irrelevant EXCEPT (and it is a big except just as the gay community has pointed out) without that legal contract you are limited by law to be there for each other in dire situations.  And if for some strange reason I suddenly really really really wanted to be married and my lover refused my proposal, I'd make sure to point out that no "I do" means I leave my massive wealth to the cats.|`|bDPU6qWiaa	why get married i live with my man 17years,isn,t that commitment|`|VWAl3tcnaa	Depends on your own self confidence, and since this was asked in Senior Citizen I am assuming that you are asking this as a senior citizen.

FACTS:  It has no long term effects, it naturally grows on earth, non-addictive, better for you than drinking, no recorded fatalities, the bible doesn't come right out and say it but it has references to the use of marijuana and if your going to do a drug it has the least risk factor.

Everyone in this world is guilty, so you or me are no better than any mugger, or any other sinner, for that matter.     It's not good to hate anyone. Also, a mugger isn't just someone who goes out, hits people over the head, and takes their money. Okay, maybe that's what you see, but what is the story behind this person? Do they have children? A drug habit that they can't overcome? In the end, these people need help and love, not hatred.    And the term "normal" is broad. What is normal? I've never met something normal so I don't know. But the average person does not want to mugged, for any reason at all, so it definitely isn't average.|`|Lm3JBhfzaa	That's a very weird idea which you should discuss with a mental health professional.|`|DIEih5asaa	It's like luring a rat into a trap.|`|bnPPrJY1aa	No|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	i think its normal but dont do it|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	no its not normal and you should get help|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	It just makes you worst than the mugger.

Some one needs to put the fear in these Fu*king sons of ******s. B ring back the death penalty. Lets smoke em out and bring em to justice YEE HAWW!|`|a445b4ce719ad72ef4d9e94a4eb60724aa	The law states that a person may use ""reasonable force"" to protect themselves or others. Going out with the intention of killing the first person who tries to mug you is not going to put you in the right frame of mind to mete out "reasonable force". It is quite possible that if you try to kill someone who intends to mug you that you will end up dead yourself. Have you got at death wish? Or perhaps you see yourself as the vigilante played by Charles Bronson in the film "Death Wish"?  In most cases of mugging the mugger intends to separate you from your cash & possibly your credit cards too, is it worth risking your life for the sake of money?  You may or may not have a reason to hate muggers, you have not provided enough info to allow us to determine that but it would be better for you to deal with your anger, (perhaps getting some help professionally) than to go around with the intention of killing a stranger & exposing yourself to the danger of serious injury or death.  You should also be aware that carrying a weapon is illegal in the UK, You can receive a five year prison sentence & a fine of 2500 just for carrying a fixed bladed knife, if you don't have a lawful reason for doing so & "self defence" would not be considered a lawful reason.  Your desire to "kill a mugger" is not the norm & therefore on the face of it is not normal. If you have had a loved one killed by a mugger the desire becomes understandable, possibly normal, though not desirable & ill advised. Don't do it.  For the second part of your question, "Do muggers deserve to be alive?" What's deserve got to do with anything? You don't have a right to kill, so as I said earlier, don't do it!

Z4avhg3eaa	I haven't heard atheists say a word about persecution.  However, I hear evangelical zealots go on all the time about how they are persecuted for Jesus' sake.    EDIT--Of course, I'll come out and say that Super Kitteh is either willfully ignorant, or lying through his teeth about atheists being responsible for the atrocities of the 20th century.  The issue behind those atrocities is replacing one nihilistic, death-worshipping, irrational belief system with another.  Christianity replaced by Marxism or Communism.  The victims of atrocities in Communist regimes weren't killed because they were believers.  They were killed because they posed a threat to the political power of the dictator in question. Invariably, the victims were political dissidents and were murdered as such, or they were simply the target du jour of a paranoid despot.  Stalin had no rationale whatsoever in his purges. Religion and its lack were utterly irrelevant.     These atrocities were committed in the name of "the Revolution" (as propounded by Lenin--or Robespierre if you go about 100 years earlier), and wherever religious suppression occurred (as in the USSR), it was because the religious establishment was part of the old political establishment (as it was in Pre-Revolutionary France and in Tsarist Russia). It was about politics and power, not about religion or atheism.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Let's take out of the religious arena, which makes sense because that is the alleged problem anyway.

How does (Fn  -  Ff) relate to the Earth-Moon separation distance (R)?  Using similar triangles,        where y is the misalignment distance of each tidal bulge, m is the Moons mass, mb is the mass of each tidal bulge, and G is the gravitational constant.  Solving for (Fn - Ff)       Equation 1b showed that the mass of a tidal bulge, mb, is approximately proportional to 1/R3, that is       where C1 is the constant of proportionality. Therefore       The velocity of the Moon (or any body in a circular orbit) is       where M is Earths mass (or the mass of the central body).  Differentiating both sides with respect to time (t) and solving for  gives       Because the Moons tangential acceleration, , is equal to , which is known from equation (2)       The slight displacement of the tidal bulge (y), as mentioned earlier, is proportional to the difference in the Earths spin rate (w) and the Moons angular velocity (wL). In other words,       Substituting (4) into (3) and replacing the product of all constants by C gives       C is found by using todays values (subscript t)       Keplers third law shows how (w - wL) varies with R:       Applying the law of conservation of angular momentum gives       where the constant L is the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, and P is Earths polar moment of inertia.  Combining (7) and (8) gives       Substituting (6), (7), and (9) into (5) gives us the final equation. Because it has no closed-form solution, it will be solved by numerical iteration. The steps begin by setting the clock to zero and R to its present value of 384,400 km. Then time is stepped backwards in small increments (dt) until the centers of the Moon and Earth are only 15,000 km apart. Had this happened, ocean tides would have steadily grown to a ridiculous 12.8 km (8 miles) high and left marks on Earth that would bebut obviously are notvisible.8       The QuickBasic program that solves this system of equations (shown on page 427) gives 1.2 billion years as the upper limit for the age of the Moon. (If the Moon began moving away from Earth 1.2 billion years ago, the Earth would have rotated once every 4.9 hours.)  Two complicated effects were neglected that would further reduce this upper limit for the Moons age.9  1. Evolutionists believe that the Earth formed by gravitational accretion of smaller bodies. If so, the impacts would have left a molten Earth. The Earth, throughout its history, would have been less rigid than it is today. Therefore, tidal bulges would have been larger, causing the Moon to spiral away from the Earth even faster than we calculated here.    2. Internal friction from tidal stretching of the solid Earth reduces Earths spin velocity. A greater value for w in the past would have increased the tidal misalignment and the Moons recession over what we assumed above. This would have been especially severe if the Earth had been less rigid in the past.    Incorporating these effects into the above analysis would make the upper limit on the Moons age even less than 1.2 billion years.  One might argue that 1.2 billion years ago the Moon was captured by the Earth or blasted from the Earth by an extraterrestrial collision.10 These events would have placed the Moon in a very elongated orbit. Today, Earths Moon and most of the almost 200 other known moons in the solar system are in nearly circular orbits.11 So many circular, or nearly circular, orbits are difficult for evolutionists to explain with any rigor.12 Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the Moon (1) was captured, (2) was blasted from Earth by an extraterrestrial collision, or (3) somehow began orbiting Earth 1.2 billion years ago.  Its orbit is too circular. (Other problems with evolutionary theories on the Moons origin are discussed under Origin of the Moon on page 28.)  Besides mountain-eroding tides, what other implications would a 1.2-billion-year-old Moon have for organic evolution and the age of Earth? Evolutionists claim that certain fossils are 2.83.5 billion years old. Had the Moon begun orbiting Earth 1.2 billion years ago, such fossils would have been pulverized by the havoc of gigantic tides. Evidently, the Moon did not originate near Earth. This further reduces the maximum age of the Moon.  All other dating techniques must assume how fast the dating clock has always ticked and the clocks initial setting. For example, radiometric techniques assume, with much less certainty, that each radioactive isotope has a constant half-life. This analysis on the Moons recession assumes that only the law of gravity has been constant. Neither assumption can be proven, but there is no doubt which assumptions scientists would favor. If Newtons law of gravitation did not hold in the past, our scientific foundations would crumble. However, if the Moon is less than 1.2 billion years old, a few evolutionary preconceptions must be discarded.  But thats p|`|a2ad85279bdbdf860b0895b8fbeb7b30aa	they get what they believe in :  NOTHING.      every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that JESUS CHRIST is lord and savior.  amen|`|KbpOGYvfaa	Yes please :)

However, you are not correct.  Obama will not set himself up as the Anti-Christ.  reasons:  to start with the Anti-christ will come from the European Union (we believe).  the anti-christ will creat a peace pact with Israel;  after which they will abandon the peace deal and war starts.  the Islamic nations with the anti-christ and the bear of the north (Russia) will form a large military presence to war against Israel.  the great army of the east (China) will also get involved at a later time.  This Islamic - russian - european Union  mass of military might will be defeated by King Jesus as He returns to earth with the Chruch that was raptured prior and will destroy 5/6ths of the armies.

M7o5lejQaa	if sexual orientation is an emotion, does that mean you can turn your straightness off whenever you want? prove to me that you can.|`|9CCtt077aa	You aren't necessarily "born" gay, but you don't choose homosexuality either. It depends on the individual. Personally, I think there is a mixture of nature AND nurture in most cases. There can be many reasons for homosexuality - hormonal reasons, childhood experiences, "exotic becomes erotic" etc. What about bisexuals? How can they be attracted (physically and emotionally) to both sexes? I think there are many gays who are actually more bisexual than what they would like to admit (and the same goes for straight people) - not all, but some. Some people (perhaps the majority) can have a very fluid sexuality. That doesn't mean that they're aware of it or act on it though. Sadly, we live in a world where you're only "allowed" to be either straight OR gay. Sad.|`|nkUPPmTCaa	No one knows what we feel, I always say, if you're not gay you don't know what the hell you're talking about, I myself am a lesbian, and trust me it's not by choice, why would I choose to be someone that society doesn't except?.....i tried to love a man before, it doesn't come out of me to do that, I feel nothing for a man, don't get me wrong I love everyone, but a woman is for me, it comes from birth.|`|yBXLgHbmaa	Why would we choose to be discriminated and ridiculed against?|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	Why do 'we' have to prove anything? Why do lesbians and gays have to analyse, agonise and pick over every aspect of our sexuality? What is the purpose? There used to be a slogan in the 70's/80's when gay and lesbian rights activists were clear what they were fighting for which read " We're here, we're queer, get used to it!" Oh! I long for those days to come around again.  Straight people do not question, don't actually think about it at all.  I'm tired of my sexuality being trivialised and/or pathologised...whether made, choice or a combination of both, I don't care, my lesbianism is as natural to me as breathing!  So not 'emotional' response...confident, unapologetic and liberated from heterosexual obsession with finding a reason!  Thank you manimal..and also for reminding me how old I am...lol 90's indeed!|`|6ELSwKKvaa	For some people, I believe it CAN be a choice (Bi-sexual that decides to only date the same sex) but for most I don't believe it is. I KNOW for my daughter it is not. Everyone is on and on about there is no gene for gayness. However, it does not have to be in a gene. They are learning that a fluctuation in the mothers hormones while pregnant at a specific time during the pregnancy can alter the way the brain is wired. The same time this brain wiring happens in a pregnancy is also the same time that the fingers are being formed. My daughter has the cutest little thumbs and I believe this must have happened because of the same hormones that caused her brain to be wired to be attracted to females. This does not mean that all gay people have odd fingers, it is just an indicator that my daughters particular desire for the same sex was most likely set at the time she was still a fetus.      There are some people who make the choice to call themselves homosexual when they may not have been born this way. I don't see them in the same light as people who were born that way. The subject gets tricky because anyone, to fill their sexual urges can float between male and female partners. But what people have to understand is we are not talking sexual desires all the time when we say homosexual. We are talking desires for commitment from the same sex.... not just intercourse.     My daughter has not been intimate or even kissed anyone yet. She just knows she can not see herself being married to a man or any of the sexual stuff either. It has absolutely no appeal to her at all and we tried our best to raise her along the "Christian" rules. Since having understood my daughters orientation, I have had to adjust my thinking about God and homosexuality. I am happy to say that I can now understand how God approves of homosexual committed relationships just as he approves of heterosexual committed relationships that we call marriage and that God does not condemn people who have not been given a choice.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	You go and choose to be gay for a day.  I guarantee you won't be able to do it.  Or you could look at a little gay porn and choose to get a *****.  Again, if you're truly straight, you won't be able to do it.  I can't get a hard on for women.  It won't happen for some reason.  Also, I would definitely rather be straight and "normal" and have a wife and kids than gay and fearful of everything my homophobic family says and of my future in that homophobic family.|`|P2kL3apWaa	Your argument seems flawed because you are basing this on emotions.  It would be like saying heterosexuality is a choice as well  or is that your point ???|`|RedEGIfZaa	Homosexuality is not an emotion.  It is a sexual orientation.    It is an innate and immutable psychological characteristic.  This is instantly demonstrable to anyone through an attempt to change your sexual orientation.  Any such attempt will prove futile.|`|J0h1TKkxaa	just cause you can control yourself doesn't make it right  i guess i could have sex with a chick..but it wouldn't be me and i wouldn't like it|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	Ha ha.  I'm really going to engage in an intellectual debate with a person who not only says "gayness," but also uses wikipedia to back up their claims.  Um, yeah.  GIANT waste of time.|`|kavhzTXgaa	Jonah awesome answer!!! *hugs*|`|VUK77SrXaa	I guess you wouldn't take my assurance that it isn't a choice in my case?      Anyway, if being gay were a choice there wouldn't be physical differences between gay men and straight men.  If being gay were a choice there wouldn't be correlations between gay men and not with straight men.  If being gay were completely genetic all identical twins raised apart would have the same orientation.  If there weren't a genetic component then the number of identical twins where one is gay would be between 0 and 10 percent.  The latest identical twins studies where one twin is gay (where the twins were raised apart) show that about 50 to 60 percent of both identical twins being gay.  There are other physical characteristics that statistically correlate with being gay (ie gay men's amygdala is smaller than straight men's amygdala, or in a study where men and women were asked to smell men's sweaty t-shirts, gay men's brain scans were very similar to woman's brain scans, where straight men's brain scan showed a completely different pattern, etc).  The strongest correlations seem to be in gay men, and far less so in lesbians.    Bottom line, it isn't a choice, but it's probably a combination of genetics/hormones in the womb/nurture.  The reason for being gay in men is likely different from the reason for being a lesbian.    Lastly, why would anyone choose to be gay in a society where they are discriminated against, gay bashed, and told they are an abomination in church?  Not very rational is it, to think anyone would chose to be gay?|`|NwXnzARwaa	Discover Magazine has shown that "Two of the most convincing studies have proved conclusively that sexual orientation in men has a genetic cause."    New Scientist has shown that "geneticists may have explained how genes apparently linked to male homosexuality survive" and "Mothers' genetic skew linked to gay sons."    LiveScience has shown that "The arrangement of a mother's genes could affect the sexual orientation of her son, according to a new study."    Scientific American has shown that "Having Older Brothers Increases a Man's Odds of Being Gay."    WebMD has shown that magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal key differences in the brains of gay and straight men and women that could add to the understanding of the biology of homosexuality.|`|TGIQtgsWaa	Homosexuality is in many species no earth, proving it's natural instead of a choice.|`|U6gz8qUcaa	well if gayness is a choice so it straightness.... so prove to me that straight aint a choice while i wink at u and say "come here....omg what is that?? is that your penis! lol!! my pinkie bigger than that!!"|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Yeah, I have one. I remember seeing a clip from a gay documentary shot in a rural part of the Philipines in the 70's. This guy from a town of like seventy was talking about how he wanted to see Manilla, but had never really been able to leave his area. He looked swishy as all heck, but didn't seem to understand homosexuality as an identity or anything (rather, something some people do,) and said he only knew a few people who liked men. I'm curious to know where he picked up his desires and his camp affect in such a place, but I think that genetics are implicated. Not to say there isn't a choice component and an environment component, but I think biology is also a determinant.      UPDATE:  I also agree with Louisebro and the 90's Queer Nation chant, "we're here, we're queer, get used to it!" Defending identities with biology puts queer people at risk of being pathologized, and in any case, essentialism may be just as false as the queer by choice argument.|`|TYQOafA8aa	I say it is a choice, I took the choice of being bi.|`|AA12006309	The Catholic church believes it's not a choice.  Taken from the Catholic Catechism:    2358 The number of men & women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. They do not choose their homosexual condition; for most of them it is a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfil God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Attraction is an instinct not an emotion. You cannot control or choose who you are attracted to...acting on that attraction could be the choice, but it is a basic human need to be sexual, so the need to act on who you are attracted to is also not a choice. I do not believe that being gay is a choice. Who would choose to be ostracized and ridiculed by the majority of the world?|`|qEdu65shaa	wikipedia isn't a reliable source|`|ui8D3m1Gaa	2 points!!!!

Turns out, Gay men physiologically respond the exact SAME as straight woman to the scent (or pheremones) of men.  This is SCIENCE saying there is biologically reasoning for "gayness."  How does an emotion explain that their brains actually respond as a straight woman's would to pheremones from men?    please, please...explain to me that.|`|7yDgYOkGaa	Being born gay, I had so choice when it came to being sexually active.  I knew from an early age who and what turned me on and who I found myself attracted to.  That has always been men.  I'm proud of my homosexuality and COULD never switch hit.  I've never wished I was straight because I'm having too much fun being gay.|`|AA11374522	You're confusing sexual orientation with sexual behavior. Choosing to not engage in sexual activity makes sex a choice, not sexual orientation. A homosexual man would still be attracted to men even if he were celibate. Abstaining from sex does not magically alter one's sexual orientation.    http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/ar...

PeQ40WcWaa	I was 13 when I came out and was in my second year of high school / Year 8 (UK).    I randomly told a friend one day just to test the waters of her reaction. Ten minutes later, she told another friend, who asked me and I admitted it. By the end of the day, most of my year knew, and by the end of the week, pretty much the entire school knew.     I actually didn't care that everyone knew and I was the only person at school who was so openly 'out'.     I never really told my Dad, we just had a kind of acknowledgement. My mom has never disowned me, but doesn't really feel 100% comfortable. I'm 24 now and my Dad is really sweet and accepting of it. It doesn't seem to bother him at all. My sister is the same way.    I live in a big city and I feel completely comfortable being open about my sexuality.    I never got bullied at school after coming out. I had a few comments and questions but I just let it wash over me and I think this helped.    The more open you are about something, the less people have to wonder about!|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	Mine was kinda funny, I've been worried about it for ages even thoug I've known I want to 'come out' and eventually I wrote a letter, went to college and worried all day... got home that afternoon asked my mum if she got the letter... she replied "what letter?" and I said "ahh....

I don't think she told me dad about it though, I think she's just hoping we will break up and I'll go back to guys, that will never happen.  But right now she never asks about my girlfriend or mentions her (and we've been together for 6 months) and when she knows I'm with her and she calls me she never asks who I'm with. So it's pretty hard right now...but I'm so happy and love my girlfriend so much.

So what you are going threw right now is probably just accepting yourself. and it takes awhile to do so.   But I know how your feeling and my advice to you and this is exactly what i did is just dont deny what you feel. dont try to like girls. if you liked a girl it would just happen. so just let whatever happens happens.  its tuff but youll get used to it.  as for the growing up gay part almost everyone who is gay realized they are gay as a child. theres nothing you can do about it no matter what. So rele the only thing you can do is just forget it and let things happen they way they are suposed to happen.|`|qbb9YiRsaa	Try not to fear what you cannot control.

I am a bit bi but in a lesbian relationship and yes she knows I am bi.|`|WFYtrtRmaa	being gay is hard period.    most of society doesnt accept gay people. they have an image of them. an image that brings on feelings of disgust and even hatred. there is lots of ignorance    BUT!...things are changing and love is spreading more and more...even if media and others focus on negative aspects of life.    listen to Rainbow Veins by Owl City. it always cheers me up! =D ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EsMHFXdL...    good luck!|`|LwoOdSycaa	its people who make you afraid. you are gay... so what? only your opinions matter. don't be scared. you will be fine.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	just be yourself, and you have no reason to be scared,|`|TkPJYlaMaa	With everything going on and how society's been such a ***** to gays, I can totally se why you'd be freaked.  Take it one steo at a time. Time gives experience and soon you'l be able to deal with it and even be happy with it. Just go on being you and everything will fall into place.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Well that's good that your not a suicide risk. I think your worried about coming out to your friends and family and the social stigma that comes with being gay. It sucks but its true. Good luck to you.|`|bhyVC2mtaa	your just worried what other people think and worried that others will judge you. there is nothing wrong with being gay and there are many support groups out there to help you. you might be worried that it will be hard finding girlfriends. you might be bi too.. who knows! you may take some time to figure yourself out.|`|FqiA5BRraa	Your probably that way,because the way society treats people who are different. You should't be afraid, live your life the way you want too.|`|GJFBsG62aa	I remember when I was in your situation(even though its been only2 years haha) but yeah. Realizing that your gay, you definitly start havin a lot of thoughts as to how life will turn out, whether people will accept you, what will your family think, etc.. All these questions I've had answered, in positive to. My friends and family love me all the same. Now my only dilemma is finding a boyfriend, but being in high school makes everything so bloody difficult. It'll take time, but in the end remember everything will turn out aight.|`|zwNaZbKlaa	Give it time.

But in all most people are intolerant of muslims because they are taught hate and have classified all muslims as terrorists. Different lifestyles,beliefs,religions and culture can all be attributed to the intolerance but have you ever thought of reversing that question to why muslims are so intolerant of americans? It works both ways and that is why we have that problem.|`|oSME7B23aa	People of the book? What?

Humans and Conflict go together. Humans are by nature aggressive and violent. especially to other humans.    Religion is but a mere excuse to justify violence. If it was not religion it would be something else.    the world is like a high school. Even if everyone was the same color and religion. People would naturally separate into groups and the next step after groups are established is to look down upon all the other groups and solidify the dominance of your group.    It is psychology, not religion    I say we of the world unite with the common goal of eradicating from this planet the scourge that is EMO.    is it better to hate or love? Neither it is better to be left alone|`|uYuaCyKaaa	Because Muslims supposedly believe that what we see as the trinity is like believing in many gods to them. The also believe in the same (one) god, just not in a trinity sort of way. And since they are willing to murder over it, the "book people" feel threatened.|`|fZGEVA1maa	Because their Qur'an demands that all good Muslims are to declare a holy jihad against all believers, including atheist, gays, jews, and so on. If they refuse to convert to Islam they are to smite (cut off our heads) our necks.     However, they seem to be changing a bit, now they're Crucifying Christians, as of Christmas of 2008.     A Christian says, "I will die for what I believe"...  A Muslim martyr says, "you will die for what I believe."    Why don't you ask if they'll renounce their [death scriptures].     And one more thing. They claim that these scriptures deal with them defending themselves. That's not true.     If you read their Qur'an, you will learn the truth. I've read the Qur'an, thus educating myself. Have you read it? Or just a book making this assumption that Islam is a religion of peace...it isn't!|`|v38WXjbFaa	The image of Muslims that the media presents us is that of Middle Eastern theocracies (also known as the asshole of the world.)    Also, Muslims tend to be recognizable as outsiders in society. They don't drink, they pray at noon like clockwork, etc.|`|4swYFtsSaa	people have different views of the same god each thinking there's is better then the other when really it dosnt matter cuse these people are idiots|`|zEBVYxcEaa	Of what book? Do you mean the Bible? If you do, then that's because they describe Jesus as just a prophet for their Messiah.   (Which I don't understand because Isaiah 9 describes Jesus as the one to come, not Mohammad)|`|3YfYWpAsaa	Wait, was it Christians bombing Muslim towers?  ...Or was it Muslims bombing the twin towers on 9/11 in a predominantly white, western, Christian nation?    For a second, you had me confused! Haha but I get it now- you simply had your question backwards.  You meant to say, "Why are Muslims so intolerant of Christians?"     And for THAT question, it is a very simple answer: The Qu'ran itself tells its followers to "kill the infidels" and slay those who don't believe in Islam, Allah, Mohammad, etc.  that is UNLIKE Christianity, which teaches to forgive, to peacefully love and try to persuade those who don't believe in god/jesus, and to turn the other cheek to violence.    Also, I would like to point out that it has been Muslims who have done over 30 major terrorist attacks on the western, christian world in the past couple decades.  MAJOR attacks- like on airlines, cargo ships, etc.    ===========    In conclusion, I know you are going to say that some Christians are violent.  You will point to the abortion clinic bomber who was a Christian. stuff like that.    The difference between those people and muslims is this: christians who do violent acts because of their faith are extremely rare, because their faith tells them NOT TO be violent!  Muslims who do violence because of their faith are much more common, since the Qu'ran approves of it.

Isa 14:12   12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! [how] art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!    The name Satan comes from a Hebrew root meaning "to oppose, be adverse," hence "to attack or to accuse" (see Rev. 12:10). On this earth the role of Satan and his fellow devils is to attack the working of righteousness and to destroy it wherever possible    ABADDON, ADVERSARY, AGENCY, ANGEL OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT, APOLLYON, BEELZEBUB, BELIAL, CAIN, CHURCH OF THE DEVIL, COMMON ENEMY, DEMONS, DESTROYER, DEVILS, DRAGON, EVIL ONE, GOD OF THIS WORLD, HELL, LUCIFER, MASTER MAHAN, PERDITION, PRINCE OF DEVILS, PRINCE OF POWER OF THE AIR, PRINCE OF THIS WORLD, SATAN, SERPENT, SON OF THE MORNING, SONS OF BELIAL, SONS OF PERDITION, SPIRITUAL DEATH, TEMPTER    Satan's influence is also manifest in the world through governmental powers, particularly those in which dictatorship and compulsion are the rule. Political philosophies, as those which spread communistic and socialistic ideologies, are his propaganda vehicles. Those educational philosophies which deny Christ, and the divine origin of man as an offspring of God, are spawned and sponsored by Satan. Secret combinations, evil oath-bound organizations, criminal gangs, and groups of every sort which run counter to the principles of the gospel of salvation are organizations founded, sponsored, and used by the devil.       Unfortunately, because even the worst and most evil organizations have some truth and good in them (otherwise they could not continue to prosper even under worldly conditions), even some of the "very elect" are deceived to the point that they support aims and programs of these devil-born groups. But "God hath said a man being evil cannot do that which is good; For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water; neither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water; wherefore, a man being a servant of the devil cannot follow Christ; and if he follow Christ he cannot be a servant of the devil,"|`|zEBVYxcEaa	I read the The NIV.

0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Well the key to answering this question is to listen to the job description. Ask for further details on something they say. It shows you have been listening and are interested in finding out more. Basically ask questions about the company or the role you are applying for that they have not covered. E.g. ask about promotion opportunities.    If you get really stuck, and can't think of anything just ask when they expect to make a decison and when will you hear from them.|`|AlCfnJKYaa	Generally when I interview people I don't "mark" that part of the interview.

zgL6vMCiaa	Praise be to Allaah.     Firstly:     We were saddened by some of the phrases in your question, which we would not like to hear from such a wise believer, but when we thought about how many people there are who block the path of goodness, and how many there are who lead people astray and propagate corruption, we felt that such things are to be expected, but we are sure that they will soon cease.       1  With regard to music:     It is forbidden and is not permissible to play musical instruments or listen to songs and tunes. The majority of scholars say that it is haraam, including the four imams of fiqh: Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafai and Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on them all).     The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Among my ummah there will be people who will regard as permissible adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5590). See also: al-Silsilah al-Saheehah by al-Albaani (91).     Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:     This hadeeth indicates that musical instruments are haraam; this includes all types of instruments.     Majmoo al-Fataawa (11/535).     And he said:     It is well known that during the best three generations of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The best of generations are my generation among whom I was sent, and the one that follows them, and the one that follows them, neither in the Hijaz nor in Syria nor in Yemen nor in Iraq nor in Egypt nor in Khorasan was there anyone among the people of goodness and religious commitment who would gather with others to listen to this innovated type of singing for the purpose of purifying the hearts. Hence it was regarded as makrooh by the imams such as Imam Ahmad and others, and al-Shaafai regarded it as one of the innovations of the zindeeqs (heretics) when he said: In Baghdad I left behind something that was innovated by the zindeeqs who called it taghbeer (a type of singing) and diverted the people from the Quraan thereby.     Majmoo al-Fataawa (10/77).     Ibn al-Qayyim said: If the zamr (a kind of pipe or flute),which is the least evil of musical instruments, is haraam, then what about those which are worse such as the oud (a stringed instrument), tambour (drum) and yaraa  (a reed instrument)? No one who has had the slightest whiff of knowledge should hesitate to regard them as haraam, and the least that can be said is that they are the symbol of corrupt evildoers and wine drinkers.     Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/228).     2  What about the Quraan? What about the hadeeths of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? How can you prefer the words of man to the words of Allaah, may He be exalted? How can you think that musical instruments are better for your heart and soul and mind than the words of Allaah, may He be exalted, and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?     Remember  may Allaah guide you and enlighten you  that the Quraan of the Most Merciful and the recitation of the Shaytaan  namely songs  cannot be joined together in the heart of the believer. You would not say that music and songs are the best thing in your life unless you have been deprived of the Quraan of the Most Merciful. Remember that the Shaytaan cannot make songs and music attractive to you in your heart and in your life until after he has turned you away from the Book of Allaah, may He be exalted. So you have to hasten to set your heart aright and turn back from what you are doing, so that you can strengthen your heart by obeying the Most Merciful and His words, and humbling yourself before His rulings.     Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:     What is meant is that forbidden songs are the recitation of the Shaytaan, because when the enemy of Allaah wanted to bring together these wrongdoers, he resorted to making music and musical instruments attractive to them, and if it comes from a beautiful woman or a handsome boy, that is more likely to make his recitation attractive to them, and to replace the joy of the Glorious Quraan with the joy of listening to music.     Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/254)     Did you review yourself and your mistakes with music and then offer prayers on time, or observe voluntary fasts, or pray at night when people are sleeping, or uphold family ties, or spend your money for the sake of Allaah, or seek Islamic knowledge? We are certain that music did not help you with these things and that whatever you did of them, music was not the cause behind them.     Remember that thinking of death, the grave, the meeting with Allaah and what Allaah has prepared for the sinners is what makes the Muslim review himself time after time, and improve his life for the better, and erase his sins and mistakes from his life. You should be certain that if what you say had any shred of truth, you would see the musicians and those who listen to music among the best and most moral of people, but is that in fact the case?     4  You have read what your Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, and you know what all the scholars, including the four imams, have said. So all you have to do is be obedient to your Lord, may He be exalted, and respond to the command of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), following the way of goodness, knowledge and obedience that was followed by the Sahaabah, Tabieen and those who came after them. How can you compare between the ruling of Allaah and your own reasoning? How can you spurn the way that was followed by the best of mankind and follow a different way that none of the righteous ever followed?     Remember that the religion of Allaah does |`|4aveC2aaaa	well, if i was going to tell you it is haraam, you will tell me that you know    but here are soms good ones:    www.nogomi.com  www.mazikana.com  www.youtube.com|`|MhbEQoJYaa	Youtube and Imeem.|`|FB2YS9fjaa	this is not the right place to ask    :)|`|e8PpsqbKaa	Agree with the dude with the gay mask.

fdMKpXCHaa	You've made the first two steps already.  One, you realize there's a problem.  And two, you know that it's caused by your own insecurity.  That said, I'll give you advice as my dad gave it to me.  I'm a guy, but it's still applicable:  "There's always going to be someone else out there with a bigger dick and a fatter wallet.  But, if you choose a girl you can trust to not cheat on you, you have no need to fear anyone else".      If you met this girl through texting while she was dating someone else, I can see why you're uneasy.   If that's the case, she cheated on someone else with you.  And lots of people believe "once a cheater, always a cheater".  If she's interested in preserving the relationship, she should understand this and curtail her flirtations.  Good luck to you both.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	You do sound jealous, to an extent, but your girl also sounds like a total flirt.

bc71a227b5c04dd53d58c757ab9159a0aa	Cette expression remonte aux environs de la Renaissance et,  cette poque, elle signifiait :   Comment allez vous  la selle ?

Il tait donc fort poli de se soucier de la forme de son interlocuteur ou de son interlocutrice, en lui demandant comment il, ou elle, avait fait ses besoins le matin.

Everyone is complaining about hating school but I wonder what they would be saying if they got NO access to an education at all (like the case is for millions worldwide).  School was not set up for you to make friends/expand your social network but to replace empty minds with open minds and to maximise your chances in the future    If only some poverty stricken kids could hear you all complaining about kids 'teasing you.' This seriously disgusts me.

Thus, i go to an american school, obviously. People there are such jerks! (Only in my school) They scream and its like a rule, that someone has to get injured, Like every freaking month.

As long as she still considers her your friend then just give her a rose and a little stuffed bear. Be casual and then tell her that you like her. But don't do it in front of the class.

uS5b2QyQaa	At your age, hormones can do quite a bit to alter the body's shape, but like any other girl, it largely comes down to genetics. If your body's been altered by testosterone, there's a decent chance that starting hormones soon enough will counteract the damage. If you have cankles, well... that probably just means you're a bit overweight, and you can take care of that with sensible eating and getting more exercise. If you're not overweight and that's just how your legs are, hormones may or may not do anything for you. Look at your female relatives and see what their legs look like... this is a good indication of what you can expect if you start hormones before puberty really sets in. Don't worry about surgery or lipo at this point... wait until you've been on hormones for a while (years) and see what they do for you first.    ---    As for starting hormones at your age though... this is a controversial issue for some. I personally think it makes sense to get on hormones and antiandrogens as soon as humanly possible, but if you or your parents are the cautious type, there's special medication (specifically a GnRH agonist, usually goserelin) you can take that basically shuts off your puberty indefinitely. The upside is that a) it's safe, and b) you won't get any more masculinized while waiting to turn 18 or whatever time is decided to go with hormones or not. The downsides are that a) you're still stuck without a girly figure, as it won't really do much if anything to feminize you, and b) it's expensive and probably not covered by insurance. (Neither are hormones, though they're generally a lot cheaper.)    The first thing you should do is find an online support group to help you out. I highly recommend http://www.trueselves.com as it's mostly younger transitioners. Next thing would be to come out to your parents, but only if you're reasonably sure it's safe and you won't be kicked out. If your parents are cool, find a gender therapist (via TrueSelves or some other trans resource) and start seeing them. If you want hormones or blockers ASAP, make sure they know this. If they try to dissuade you or otherwise put up roadbloacks or lie to you, find a different one... it's not their job to do that. They should guide you, not lead you.    That should get you started. In the meantime, you can work on eating a healthy diet, getting exercise, and taking care of your skin and hair. This will go a long way towards feminizing your appearance. Again, may or may not do much for your legs, but it'll be good for you in general.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	First off, when you turn 18 I'd go see a gender therapist. After seeing them for a minimum of 3 months, they will give you the letter you need to get hormones legally (please don't do this illegally from the streets, many die this way, and plus the results will not be as good unless you go to a doctor). Then from there I'd really recommend you research for an endocrinologist that is trans friendly, why, because they know what they are doing better than a general endo. (If you google transgender or transsexual friendly endocrinologists you'll find them) Depending on where you are, I'd recommend the Hamilton Center in Los Angeles, CA. The endo there is extremely knowledgeable and has many MTF clients.    Hormones won't really alter your bone structure but they will definately give you a feminine physique. They redistribute where fat is placed on the body. They will help your body slim down, so your legs should go down after awhile but every person is different. You may need to workout to get your legs into shape. Swimming, running and biking will all do that for you over some time. Hormones will change your face to be feminine but depending on your face before hormones surgery can be required  for some MTFs later down the road.The earlier you start hormones though, the less likely it is that you will need facial feminization surgery.    When taking hormones I'd opt for the pellets that are injected because oral hormones are bad for your liver and won't give you as good as results as the injections will.    Good luck with your transition!|`|7Z3hWNewaa	I'm not trans, but I do frequent a wonderful website called Oasis Journals. It's a website for LGBT youth where you can post journals, forums and chat with other LGBT youth. Check it out, it's a great resource and everyone there is really friendly.

yAXNUiodaa	Well, its pretty simple. Basically in "your" perspective you will never actually be dead.  According to the laws of our universe, time goes on forever. Therefore there is an infinite amount of time for particles (molecules, atoms, quarks, whatever) that make up your identity (your brain and changes to it that have undergone through your experiences) to reform in some way to the state they were in right before you died.  So dieing is just like a long nap without dreams.      You may say, "the laws of our universe may not be exactly what we perceive".  To that... I would simply... "shrug" and add, why does anything exist in the first place?|`|67EaIAvbaa	we go to heaven and be with GOD|`|0ujQ0zl2aa	we go to heaven to be judged about our actions when we were alive.  and if we were good and believed in jesus christ then we go to heaven.  and if we were bad and didn't believe in jesus christ then we go to hell.|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Nothing, orrr, if I'm having a dreamy day,   I really wish I'd go to Kanto and train pokemon all my life.

Like you don't remember your sleep. It is just black. It's nothing you don't feel anything anymore. You don't know what's going on your just in peace.  I don't know why I think like this. My twin died and you know how they have connections? Well i think I feel her this way. Like I know what she is doing just in peace.  I'm an atheist so you won't hear me talk about god sorry.  But this is my belief and I respect the religious beliefs so please respect my belief.
5ofS2qQYaa	well, first of all, there shouldn't be pressure coming from him or anyone for you to make a decision too quickly, okie? I'm sure you're fine...just making sure    next, so you can't forget someone...the best way is to be practical and rational. Remind yourself why it didn't work out, if it was a good reason, and remember that everything happens at the will of Allah(swt), so if there is no solution to the problem, then accept it and move on slowly if you need to.    and this guy, he seems great, but you're not happy with him.  don't go through with it until you can clear the other one from your mind  maybe you just need some time, but you should not go through with this one if you have unresolved business. it would not be fair to him or yourself    remember that you can't always get what you want b/c we really don't know what we want, besides to be good Muslims. Only Allah(swt) knows what we want, and what our truest intentions and feelings are, so you should try to accept that and take some time to do it    give some time for the Isthikara (that's what you did, right?)...give some time for a sign...maybe there's already a sign, keep your mind open to it and constantly pray and keep Allah(swt) in your mind      Good Luck, insha'allah      Allah(swt) knows best|`|7zo0ZOThaa	There shouldn't be doubts when you like a person.|`|zDf186Xyaa	What you need to do is look for the qualities which makes that person unique and different to the other person.

Getting to your other part compatibilty is very true, The previous guy you liked may be okay for the short term but not long term. If this current guy your with has more to offer to you, to your family, and you are able to present him to your parents, and be the father of your children then he is a better choice. You should look at the qualities he has to offer which will help you in the long run, not the short run.

It is not wrong that you still have feelings for the first guy you thought you were going to marry, but if the new person is a good fit for you, consider that when you actually are married and can develop your relationship on a deeper level, your heart is likely to re-arrange the feelings you have for the first guy and you will heal from it.|`|e8PpsqbKaa	You said you dont love that guy yet you were willing to marry him.. am i missing something?

UibsALccaa	Start of by reading a reliable translation of the Qur'an. Then read Hadiths. Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are the most reliable. In the Qur'an and Hadith, you will find out what the fundamentals of Islam are. Oh, and here's a site that gives pamphlets and the translated version of the Qur'an out for free. But, you do have to pay for P&P. They also deliever outside of the UK but I think you have to pay.    The Pillars of Islam are:  Shahadah (declaration of faith)  Salah (5 daily prayers)  Zakat (charity)  Sawn (fasting)  Hajj (pilgrimage to Mekkah)    The Pillars of Imaan (faith) are believing in:  Allaah  The Angel  The Holy Books  The Day of Judgement  The Qadr of Allaah (the Divine Decree)  The Messengers of Allaah    You may want to research what Shirk is too. You can also go to your local mosque and ask the imam or you can ask a scholar/sheikh.    The site is:http://www.idci.co.uk/home.php  If you need to know anything, just email me.

They'll also be a section for Islamic events and you can check if there any where you live and go and have a look.     Hmm a plan of study. Where do you live by the way? Maybe you can find a local mosque that does certain courses. Like in East london, in Tayibbun, they have Fiqh studies and aqeedah studies which might help you increase in knowledge about Islam.

There really isnt a list of things...but I'll try.  The main things are the five pillars of Islam-Shahadah(profession of faith-the declaration that there is only one God, and Muhammad is His prophet-this one line makes a person a Muslim) , prayers, charity, hajj(pilgrimage), and fasting during ramadan.    1. Buy an English translation of the Quran. It is THE source of Islam, and is quite easy to understand on its own. If you do require reference, you can look them up online(like maybe AllExperts.com), but I'd advise you to not buy any Tafseer/Commentary, as they were not written at the time of revelation, and are haram(unlawful). You could however, look up the history of Muhammad's(saw) life/time.    2. The next source is the sunnah/hadeeth, which are the teachings of the Prophet(saw). You can buy them, or look them up online. I would advise you to take them with a pinch of salt(as some verses are contradictory to the Quran), and remember that it is always Allah's word which is final, and not man's , even it was the Prophet(saw) himself. Whether the Prophet(saw) also narrated everything in the hadeeth may also be debatable.  3. Are you a convert? You have to undergo the Shahada. If you want to, but dont know how to pray, go to a local mosque and see if they have pamphlets on how to pray(5 times a day), or ask someone to teach you. Alternatively, you could check out youtube.    I dont mean any offense either, but yes, please dont follow any Islamic 'laws' other than that which are written in the Quran. Sectarianism is haram, but its best to follow sunnis, as we follow Islam the way the prophet(saw) and his followers did. A name was only give to us for the sake of differentiation. Shias came into existence after the Prophet's (saw) death, and Islam was already established by then, so Allah could not have ordained it, no matter what they claim.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Start with your heart.|`|vMAEeh66aa	You can read Shia Islam Books :    Shi'a Islam (book)  by Allama Tabatabai    Fatemeh Is Fatemeh  by Ali Shariati    Then I was Guided  ? by Muhammad al-Tijani    The Shi'ah are (the real) Ahl al-Sunnah (book)  ? by Muhammad al-Tijani    Mafatih al-Jinan  collected by Shaykh 'Abbas Qummi.

The effects of these unique properties are presently being critically evaluated in terms of types of diseases treated, modes of therapy, and mechanism of healing.    Rich in life-enhancing minerals, the Dead Sea waters and mud have been acclaimed throughout the ages. This unique body of water is situated on the Syrian-African fault, a geological phenomenon that came into being some three million years ago during a great natural upheaval. Many ancient layers of mineral-rich earth were exposed. Salt water springs erupted, forming a valley and a lake 1300 feet below sea level, making it the lowest place on earth.     An evaporation process continuing for thousands of years resulted in increased levels of minerals and salt in the lake, which is known as the Dead Sea.    The composition of the Dead Sea is considered unique, containing the highest levels of magnesium, calcium, silica, sodium, and potassium in comparison to any other body of salt water in the world, including the oceans. Since ancient times, millions of people have come to the region to relax, to enjoy its beauty and to experience the healing, beautifying, and rejuvenating powers of the Dead Sea.    These visitors soak in the famous waters and coat themselves in the celebrated revitalizing black mud. Medical research and multiple studies have proved beyond all doubt the efficacy of these minerals in treating and preventing various diseases such as psoriasis, acne, and rheumatism. As in the past, the Dead Sea continues to attract tens of thousands of visitors annually to its many resorts and treatment spas.|`|PPFonRYdaa	Oh yes. It happened in King of Prussia, PA.

However, that does not mean that we will never sin again after we are saved.  Some people think that repentance means to be sorry for your sin.  That is not even close to the biblical meaning. People can say over and over how sorry they are, but that does not necessarily mean they will change their behavior.  It does not just mean to feel bad about your sin either.  What true repentance means is to make a complete turn from the sin that you are committing and turn back to God and follow Him. We will want to sin less and less if we are truly born again= but we can still sin- and when we do we must put to death everything that hinders us.  What Jesus expects from us is to love Him with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength and when we do fall into sin, to immediately confess (agree with God that is sin) and repent (turn immediately away from the sin, not to just feel sorry).|`|IqqaA2wIaa	to be sorry for sinning....we will still make mistakes....|`|WF085j2Daa	Repent means, sh1t I got caught better tell them I am sorry|`|Op81lhjuaa	Repentance    The Bible tells us, "...God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent," (Acts 17:30). But, what is repentance according to the Bible? Biblically, it can mean anything from sincere regret to altered behavior that results in a moral change. God desires that we repent. He desires that our behavior, deeds, and words be molded to the image of His Son. As Jesus said, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," (Matt. 4:17). Okay, so we are supposed to repent, But repent from what? What is it we are supposed to stop doing? What are we to change?    Sin is breaking God's law. The Law of God is best exemplified in the Ten Commandments which is a reflection of the perfect, holy, and pure nature of God's character. God cannot lie, or steal, or bear false witness because these things are against His nature. God is good. Therefore, the Law is good and it is the standard of moral perfection. But we, on the other hand, are fallen creatures who cannot keep the law perfectly. Those of use who are redeemed constantly fight with our fleshly desires (1 Peter 2:11) in an effort to obey God and be conformed to His holiness: "Be holy for I am holy," (1 Pet. 1:16). That is, we continually fight against our natural tendency to do that which is often contrary to God's will. This is why Paul said in Rom. 7:19, "For the good that I wish, I do not do; but I practice the very evil that I do not wish." So, we are to repent of any and all things contrary to God's revealed word which means we need to study the Bible so we might be better conformed to what He desires. We also need to face the reality that even though we Christians are redeemed, we are still battling our sins and, unfortunately, we fail too often to live up to the standard of God's holy perfection. This is why we need Jesus.    Jesus is the One who stood in our place and fulfilled all of the Law of God perfectly. He never sinned (1 Pet. 2:22). When we become Christians, the righteousness of Jesus is imputed to us; that is, it is reckoned to our account so that God sees us as being righteous because of the work of Christ. This means that our repentance from our sins is not without purpose or value. You see, we know too well that we repent of sins that we commit over and over again. But we must ask how can God forgive us if we have asked for forgiveness for a sin(s) and yet we continue to fall back into it? Does not our failure condemn us and prove that we have not repented? Not at all. Jesus bore all our sins in His body (1 Pet. 2:24), not just some of them, not just the ones we are able to repent of, but also the ones that we struggle with and continually fight against. The important truth is that we are not redeemed by our efforts at holiness and we do not maintain salvation by repenting and not sinning. All our hope and security is in Jesus and He loves us and forgives us as often as we need it. Of course, this does not mean that it is okay to sin just so we can be forgiven (Rom. 6:1-2). But it does mean that we are secure and free in Christ to not have to beat ourselves up in our efforts to please Him.    Beware of a pitfall. Sometimes, penance is part of our problem. Penance is a repayment, a way of fixing a wrong. Sometimes we try and make things right with God through an effort or self inflicted guilt. Of course, there is nothing wrong with making things right with someone you've sinned against and guilt is the right response to a wrong deed. But, there is absolutely no penance that we can do that can ever please God in anyway. If there were, then Jesus would not have needed to die for our sins (Gal. 2:21). The simple truth is that if we try and do something to suffer in order to make ourselves right with God, we are insulting God and the very work of Christ on the cross by attempting to please God by our works. This must be avoided at all costs. Let me restate this yet again. Penance is sinful when it is aimed at making ourselves right with God. The only way we can be right with God is by throwing ourselves at the cross and asking forgiveness from the Lord Himself.    Do you have sins you need to repent of? Are there some old habits, some new sins, some people you're not reconciled with, or something else that is contrary to God's word that you have not turned from? If so, then confess it to God and repent. Don't try and please God through your efforts to make up for a sin against Him. Please God by completely and totally relying on Jesus -- and turning from your sins. You need to know that God is there to forgive you and to love you. He is good and kind and patient with you. "Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?" (Rom. 2:4, NASB).    Repentance is a holy command of God. It is something He can give to you (2 Tim. 2:5) through the grace of His Son Jesus. Seek God's holiness and turn from that which is unholy.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	It's been likened to a grenade.  You throw that grenade one way and run the other.

To "repent" means to feel sorry for what you did and ask forgiveness. That's what Christ asks of us. And yes, it means that you should try (with Christ's help) to stop doing the sin that you've been doing. If it is a sin that is habitual and out of your control, you should definitely seek help from the Lord, because there are some sins that we are just too weak to overcome by our own power. We need the strength of Christ.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Repent does NOT mean "to turn away" or to "turn from your sins".     Repent is METONEA in Greek, which means to change your mind.  Change your mind from unbelief in Jesus, to belief in Jesus.     You cannot be saved by "turning away from sins", and "turning away from sins" is not required for salvation.  If it were, then NOBODY would get into heaven, since all saved believers are still sinners.     So ignore any answer you got that said to "turn away from sins".  They are wrong.     The truth is that Jesus paid for our sins IN FULL on the cross, all sins past, present, and future, and then Jesus rose from the dead.  If you believe this, then you are going to heaven NO MATTER WHAT!  That's how great the salvation from Jesus is!  :)|`|AA11188574	*** it-2 p. 770 Repentance ***    The verb repent means change ones mind with regard to past (or intended) action, or conduct, on account of regret or dissatisfaction, or feel regret, contrition, or compunction, for what one has done or omitted to do. In many texts this is the thought of the Hebrew na?cham. Na?cham can mean feel regret, keep a period of mourning, repent (Ex 13:17; Ge 38:12; Job 42:6), as well as comfort oneself (2Sa 13:39; Eze 5:13), relieve oneself (as of ones enemies). (Isa 1:24) Whether regret or comfort, it can be seen that a change of mind or feeling is involved.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	It basically means to feel sorry for and regret your sins.|`|Cqr1sffjaa	The real question here is "What is sin?".  Back out of the "NT" momentarily and read the "OT", and the answer will be clear.  By the way 1 John 3  "sin is the transgression of the Law", the 'Law' here is the Torah/penteteuch.  The word itself does not imply LAW but INSTRUCTIONS.  You will, from time to time, break an instruction but sinning is purposely do so, over and over.|`|g1QckbIBaa	Here is a verse from Proverbs (sorry dont know the exact paramters) that really hits at the hearts at true repentance.  "He who covers his sins will not prosper but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy."  So yes confessing the sin to God and forsaking it would be repentance.|`|0JE41mXsaa	The Greek word for Repent is "metanoia"    Meta = Change (like the Metamorphosis of a Butterfly)  Noia = Soul or Mind or even Life.    So when St. John the Baptist or Christ said "Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand" what were they saying... for us to CHANGE our lives!    We are sinful and fallen, so when we fall short of the perfection to which we have been commanded in Matthew 5:48  "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" then we must _again_ repent.    A man that falls down into the mud, doesn't just lie there until he dies, but gets up, brushes himself off and continues walking towards his destination... spiritual life is the same.    Each time we repent, we begin anew our Christian struggle and we have the opportunity to overcome our sinful inclinations (or Passions).  Through a lifetime of struggle and by God's grace we can become more "Christ-like"!      So... the bottom line is if we sin and remain in our sinfulness - then we never advance spiritually and remain estranged from God.  i.e repentance is NOT a once-in-a-lifetime act, but a lifetime choice that brings us closer to God.

The only written evidence is that an Arthur and Medraut were killed at the Battle of Camlann in the early 500s AD.  This is now seen as being at Slaughterbridge, near Tintagel in Cornwall, but this is a guess.     Camelot could be Cadbury Castle, an iron age hill fort re-used as a large Hall at about the correct  date after the Roman empire failed.     Tintagel is Arthur's birth place in legend and film.   It was a rich person's residence, also at a time when any Arthur would have lived, but proof is missing as to who lived there, despite Artognou being inscribed on a slate.     Strangely enough there is a man, now living in Britain, who has changed his name to Arthur Pendragon and claims to be King  Arthur.

QM2UqZmuaa	Keep in mind a lot of homeless are in a catch-22 (that is, a dead end situation).    Need a job? Well 1st you must show a birth certificate or state I.D.    In the U.S., in order to get a social security card, you must 1st have a mailing address. Don't have a mailing address? Then I guess you can't get 1.    A homeless could love to have an apartment if he got money. But what landlord would allow a homeless a 12-month lease?    So you see how corrupt society is?    Society is arranged such that anyone that is willing to work can? Pure bull ****.    This is why I sympathize with the homeless. A lot of them would love to get a job, but most of them can't.    So as to answer your question, if you're asking for a number, I'm afraid I don't have 1. But all I can say is - if some rich man came up to homeless people and offered them money in exchange for labor, I bet a lot of them would be willing to get started on that.    Of course, the I.R.S. or equivalent wanting to receive taxes from the homeless will be another story...|`|WNWKDw4uaa	They don't get presents because they're homeless.|`|REC4YgOuaa	you mean what percent right?|`|2urD4NtEaa	you're hot, can we date?|`|UBS4jIAcaa	do you mean percent?    homeless people are going to be a very difficult group from which to gather empirical data, for a number of fairly obvious reasons.    what is more interesting is your motivation for asking.    heres some related questions for you to ask;    what % of homeless people suffer from mental illnesses?    what is the average life expectancy of someone that has a history of homelessness?    compared to a housed person, how many homeless people are victims of violent assault?    out of the above, are there some people that just reject the social norm of wage slave/bill payer? and are they happier?

You jump up to the next and most severe level when you commit murder, fornication including adultery, false testimony that leads to the demise of others, etc, etc.    For those sins, you have to do a lot more 'footwork' to retain forgiveness.

Competition fuels innovation, and innovation creates all the things we enjoy.    Pride - who would deny a man his pride?  Being proud of your accomplishments is what makes us human!  If we were all submissively humble that would be a horrible, horrible society.  Repression is BAD.    Anger - anger is as natural as breathing, and trying to suppress it will literally kill you.

This it it!|`|Op81lhjuaa	The statistics say that 10 out of 10 people die. Its true  we all have an appointment with death. A question each of us should ask is What happens after I die? The Bible says that God has a standard that he will judge you by on your appointed day of death. Its called the Ten Commandments. Lets see how you will do. Have you ever told a lie? (Including white lies and fibs) Have you ever stolen anything? (no matter the value) The third Commandment is You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. Have you ever used His name as a curse word to express disgust? The seventh Commandment is You shall not commit adultery, but Jesus said If you look upon a woman to lust after her youve already committed adultery with her in your heart. Have you ever looked at another person with lust or desire? If you said 'yes' to these four questions, then by your own admission youre a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer-at-heart, and weve only looked at four of the Ten Commandments. On Judgment Day, if God were to judge you by those standards, would you be innocent or guilty? Would you go to Heaven or Hell?    The Bible says that you would be guilty, that means hell. Know that God, the just judge of the universe, is also rich in mercy. He sent His Son Jesus to suffer and die on the cross on your behalf to take the punishment for your sins. He paid your fine with His life's blood. That means God can commute your death sentence. He can allow you to live because of what Jesus did on the cross. Through His death and resurrection, God can now dismiss your case. He can forgive your sins and allow you to live. So what must you do? You must repent - turn from your sins. Don't just confess your sins to God; confess and forsake them. Don't just believe in Jesus - trust in Him, like you would trust in a parachute to save you. You don't just believe in a parachute, you put your trust into it! That's what you must do with the savior.

Christians are looking forward to have a lot of fun in Heaven...!!!    By believing in Jesus and being saved the Bible writers tell you that you will get one of the first seats in Heaven to watch how the vast majority of all the human beings perhaps into the TRILLIONS including your unsaved family members and old acquaintances will be especially tormented one by one in a sulfuric lake of fire or what have you for ever and ever. You will be encouraged to poke fun at them showing a wet big finger for them to lick to quench their thirst because in Hell there is no fresh water and you can tease them all you want for ever and ever! Thats HEAVEN! No wonder Jesus said that you must hate your father and your mother and everybody else to follow him, especially if they are "unsaved" and go to HELL! You will hear a lot of I told you so from Sweet Jesus! He thought of everything even some low IQ teasing games that WE CAN ALL PLAY with the damned in Hell! Heaven is for the childlike poor and uneducated so please bear with me in this story right out of Gods Holy Word, the Bible!    Luke 16:23-25-NIV (Jesus is telling us) AND BEING IN TORMENTS IN HELL, he* (*Not a gay person, or a Godless Atheist, or and abortionist, but a rich Jewish person whom Jesus knew personally! In those days to be rich was the fad sin of the day.) lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom* (*If you go to Hell you will recognize EVERYBODY in Heaven especially your family members, and vise versa!). Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME. (and Jesus all excited and turned on like mad continues the story telling) But Abraham said, Son* (*Abraham was an ancestor of this rich man! Notice how little compassion any member of your own family will have on you if you end up in Hell!), remember that in your lifetime you received your good things* (*again. in this story to be rich is a sin! Christian preachers now use it to make it applicable to ANY SIN!), and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted* (* for all eternity, for ever and ever, and ever! billions and trillions of years!!!) and YOU ARE TORMENTED! Believe it or not, there is hardly any other specific description in the Bible of what else any Christian will be doing in Heaven except for worshiping this narcissist Bible God for ever and ever and ever!!!    The Bible God promised the Jews to be rich lenders not borrowers like this rich man in Hell, otherwise IF THEY DONT OBEY they will be poor slaves and borrowers like Lazarus in Heaven! This story is more proof that nothing in the Bible makes any sense or can be taken seriously! Thats why I get a lot of email telling me that not everything in the Bible is factual! Especially the silly teasing words that the Bible writers dreamed up Sweet Jesus aka Creator of the Universe will personally enjoy hearing and watching the Christians POKE AT ALL THOSE IN HELL FOR EVER AND EVER for not believing in Jesus, or for never hearing about him, or not having the mental faculties in order to accept Jesus, or not being obedient to the clergy, or not being respectful at all the Christian religious displays in public places, or not paying the tithes and offerings ON TIME! It will be a long time before anybody in Heaven can possibly get bored! Christians hate homosexuals, atheists, abortionists, and what have you. Only Jesus knows what other torments await for those in HELL!!! Low IQ people will love to be entertained for ever and ever like that or wouldnt they? Thats about the only hope that they have on being right on anything! What the heck! It is all in the Bible that Christians hardly read!    Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this other story, too!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here AND KILL THEM IN FRONT OF ME!* (*Not even the Mafia measures up to Jesus! Christianity surely is a slaughter house religion and the preachers know!)    Revelation 14:10-11 (NIV) [Jesus says] "he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. HE WILL BE TORMENTED WITH BURNING SULFUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS AND OF THE LAMB* (*i.e. Sweet Jesus Christ, and the Christians who managed to be saved in spite of all the hurdles that Jesus set up -John 17:24 will enjoy watching!) And THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT RISES FOR EVER AND EVER. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name."     On a second thought I give you my personal view on Heaven and Hell that some of the most honest Bible writers share with me. There is no Heaven and Hell. The whole idea is a religious people control device and a money making scheme banking on human religious gullibility! The Bible writers had God certify King Solomon to be the WISEST MAN ever to set foot on this Earth, and he has this to say...     Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 (NIV) For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward* (*The grave is the final reward!), and even the memory of them is forgotten* (*Not true in all cases, but what the heck this is Gods word!). [10]   WHATEVER your hand finds to do, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT* (*without any restriction just be wise!), for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.    Ecclesiastes 3:19 (NIV) Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is vanity.

The meaning of the stories is contained in the truths that conclude them; each story is like an allusion pointing to its concluding truth. Therefore, they are not mere fictitious tales, but veritable truths.]       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.     Look, then, to the signs of God's mercy - how He restores life to the earth after its death - verily He it is Who quickens the dead, for He is powerful over all things.1       Brother, if you wish for a discussion of resurrection and the hereafter in simple and common language, in a straightforward style, then listen to the following comparison, together with my own soul.     Once two men were travelling through a land as beautiful as Paradise (by that land, we intend the world). Looking around them, they saw that everyone had left open the door of his home and his shop and was not paying attention to guarding it. Money and property were readily accessible, without anyone to claim them. One of the two travellers grasped hold of all that he fancied, stealing it and usurping it. Following his inclinations, he committed every kind of injustice and abomination. None of the people of that land moved to stop him. But his friend said to him:     "What are you doing? You will be punished, and I will be dragged into misfortune along with you. All this property belongs to the state. The people of this land, including even the children, are all soldiers or government servants. It is because they are at present civilians that they are not interfering with you. But the laws here are strict. The king has installed telephones everywhere and his agents are everywhere. Go quickly, and try to settle the matter."     But the empty-headed man said in his obstinacy: "No, it is not state property; it belongs instead to some endowment, and has no clear or obvious owner. Everyone can make use of it as he sees fit. I see no reason to deny myself the use of these fine things. I will not believe they belong to anyone unless I see him with my own eyes." He continued to speak in this way, with much philosophical sophistry, and an earnest discussion took place between them.     First the empty-headed man said: "Who is the king here? I can't see him," and then his friend replied:     "Every village must have its headman; every needle must have its manufacturer and craftsman. And, as you know, every letter must be written by someone. How, then, can it be that so extremely well-ordered a kingdom should have no ruler? And how can so much wealth have no owner, when every hour a train2 arrives filled with precious and artful gifts, as if coming from the realm of the unseen? And all the announcements and proclamations, all the seals and stamps, found on all those goods, all the coins and the flags waving in every corner of the kingdom - can they be without an owner? It seems you have studied foreign languages a little, and are unable to read this Islamic script. In addition, you refuse to ask those who are able to read it. Come now, let me read to you the king's supreme decree."     The empty-headed man then retorted:     "Well, let us suppose there is a king; what harm can he suffer from the minute use I am making of all his wealth? Will his treasury decrease on account of it? In any event, I can see nothing here resembling prison or punishment."     His friend replied: "This land that you see is a manoeuvering ground. It is, in addition, an exhibition of his wonderful royal arts. Then again it may be regarded as a temporary hospice, one devoid of foundations. Do you not see that every day one caravan arrives as another departs and vanishes? It is being constantly emptied and filled. Soon the whole land will be changed; its inhabitants will depart for another and more lasting realm. There everyone will be either rewarded or punished in accordance with his services."     That treacherous empty-headed one retorted rebelliously: "I don't believe it. Is it at all possible that a whole land should perish, and be transferred to another realm?"     His faithful friend then replied: "Since you are so obstinate and rebellious, come, let me demonstrate to you, with twelve out of the innumerable proofs available, that there is a Supreme Tribunal, a realm of reward and generosity and a realm of punishment and incarceration, and that just as this world is partially emptied every day, so too a day shall come when it will be totally emptied and destroyed.     o First Aspect: Is it at all possible that in any kingdom, and particularly so splendid a kingdom as this, there should be no reward for those who serve obediently and no punishment for those who rebel? Reward and punishment are virtually non-existent here; there must therefore be a Supreme Tribunal somewhere else.     o Second Aspect: Look at the organization and administration of this kingdom! See how everyone, including the poorest and the weakest, is provided with perfect and ornate sustenance. The best care is taken of the sick. Royal and delicious foods, dishes, jewel encrusted decorations, embroidered garments, splendid feasts - all are to be found here. See how everyone pays due attention to his duties, with the exception of empty-headed people such as yourself. No one transgresses his bounds by as much as an inch. The greatest of all men is engaged in modest and obedient service, with an attitude of fear and awe. The ruler of this kingdom must possess, then, great generosity and all-embracing compassion, as well as, at the same time, great dignity, exalted awesomeness and honour. Now generosity|`|APvWqIoXaa	One of the main things you hear when people die is that they've "gone to a better place."  This cannot be further from the truth.  It really is a false teaching as St. Paul writes in the Holy Bible that "the dead in Christ will rise first."  Basically, no one gets into heaven until the second coming of Jesus.  Alive or in most cases, dead.|`|3YfYWpAsaa	The all-knowing wrestler says:    Although the chance of any religion (or even A religion) being true are very small.... the chance of inventing a religion from scratch and then saying it will be true makes the chances even smaller!!    Even with religion, you should base it off eyewitnesses and facts and testimony- for example, many people saw jesus rise from the dead, his miracles, and his ascension into heaven, and his death on the cross.  That is why the most people are Christians out of any religion- we are comfortable that it's true, since so much evidence points to it!|`|H85cncciaa	I'm not a Christian, yet I not only believe there is an afterlife, I know there is.  Some people are blessed with paranormal gifts that show there are spirits. It's logical to think if there are spirits there is more after we die.  I don't understand why people would even want to think this is it, we live we die.   The theory of cant see or touch it makes it not real...well can't see or touch love, but I dare anyone to say it does not exist.   Gypsy

ULC3nOSbaa	Well, essentially, rice is a staple food in Asia. Western Europeanised civilisation has evolved around bread. Toasts, rolls, baguettes, sandwiches, croutons, etc. We need to have it as Westerns generally. Potatoes can be included, but not all cultures eat it.     For example, we have expressions in English like "Breadwinner" or  " He makes a lot of dough".     In Korea, a friend can ask you if you have eaten your rice today, which is another way of expressing how are you?     Rice has integrated Asian culture to the extent of not only being a staple food, but that it is an essential part of their identity?    Now go out there and be the rice-winner!|`|jgpYS0oEaa	I wonder why people think only Asians eat rice. So many Latinos and Africans eat rice also. Why would you think they eat just rice? There are so many different varieties of food within the culture.     I eat rice a lot too, it's filling, it goes well with food. Just like Americans eat a lot of bread with their meals (toast, bagel, biscuit, dinner rolls, sandwhiches)    It's funny you say it's cheap! It isn't. rice has gone up so much! So many people are complaining...the rice at wal-mart and krogers is really cheap though...but the quality sucks. Haha I know my rice.|`|AA10463356	Only and always?

Further, the passage you quote is Jesus talking about HIMSELF.  He was admonishing the people who never believed the prophets but believed every other rumor they heard.    Finally, Jesus never mentioned Mohammed, EVER.  The Comforter is the Holy Spirit, and Jesus Himself said so.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	I don't hit links on Yahoo Answers because the one time I did, it was malicious.

John 5:     43 I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.     44 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?     45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.     46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.     47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?  When he says Father, it means protector???  Twisting the words of Christ does not make you a believer in Christ.      It says if you don't believe the words of Moses (Torah)  How will you believe his words ( Gospel)  Both of which you call corrupt.  When it says another will come in his own name it refers to one like Muhammad you are correct he does  prophesy Muhamamd's coming and how you will beleive him rather then the Son of God    If Jesus only meant protecter rather Father..Why was he accepting worship?    So Jesus is saying he came in the name of the protecter not the Son of God..do you believe in the one who is protected and the man worshiped him?    John 9:     35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?     36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?     37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.     38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.       Does Son of God mean protecter in this verse?    Isa is not Jesus Christ.    When Jesus said those who don't believe in the words of Moses don't believe his words...he must surely have meant Muslims huh?    How could Son of God mean protecter? It means you don't believe his woirds as he said..imagine that Jesus meant what he said. The fact that you insist on twisting his words proves his point.|`|AEqOczcCaa	It's very beautiful. I hope one day I can listen to it in person.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Yeah, all the time - I spend 2 months each year in the middle east. I like it (except the first one at 4.30am).  I particulary love it in Bahrain where the Majority are Shia and the minority Sunni, the mosques seem to battle at prayer time, particularly cos they can't even agree on the correct time to bang your head on the floor, so you get a delay of a minute or two beteen Sunni and Shia mosques.     However, I despise it when I hear in in England - it makes me feel under attack, a bit like air raid sirens during the war.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Thanks for the link.  His love for God is beautiful - i can hear it in his voice.    I have heard the call to prayer in Cairo - i was visiting my brother who was working there and living close to a Mosque.    I must say i feel it belongs in Muslim countries and wouldn't like to hear it in the UK where i live - it just doesn't belong here. (no offense meant)      blessings    : )  ~~~~~~~~~~    I agree with Scotgirl and Djmantx !|`|57ceddb785d960ae7ee37f6562986527aa	No.|`|54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	Yeah i have, the noisy beggars!|`|bVsRXAapaa	no|`|AA10711210	Yes|`|kh6Qh9Usaa	Yeah i'm a Muslim and I have heard it in Pakistan and in England many times =]|`|AA11225089	Yes, in Malaysia.|`|8NqQvOqQaa	yeah  part of my family are muslims  i hear it all the time on telly    and if people haven't heard it  why answer this question?|`|K1iUzewyaa	yes, everynight and morning.. call to prayer... in Iraq.. over a loud speaker, the whole town can hear the call to prayer..|`|n7jXAQFWaa	I heard it daily when deployed to Afghanistan, same as jj240.|`|lXcH7ekkaa	I havent actually heard it live but i think it is a beautiful sound when i hear it on TV.|`|tjXOuw2Zaa	Yes, I have heard it many times and I feel it is eerie.  I do not like it.|`|JCnSm91uaa	You bet!!! late in the evening and again at about 4:00 AM in the morning... the loudspeakers were blasting the prayers practically next door to the hotel that I was staying in Bahrain...  I opened the window of my hotel room and the whole city was on that prayer call...!!!|`|10z4YDd7aa	On a short cruise in Egypt a few years ago, there were around 4 or 5 mosques in a row just back from the Nile.   The call to prayer started just as we approached the first one.   It was really impressive to hear as the PA's started up all at once (who knows they may even have been joined up!)    Also heard it in Morocco!|`|c4355bd0ba89e8bedb0136a8c6f64cb2aa	Many times - The most beautiful call I ever heard was the Imam singing a prayer from the minaret for a funeral - not the loudspeaker drone, but a single solitary voice over a the quiet evening old city of Jerusalem in 1993. It was so beautiful and fragile it made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck - not bad since I am an Atheist.    I think Islam has lost so much beauty with the introduction of loud speakers and tape recordings - but they have to compete with the cars and radios now. I heard two singers in Samarkand, do a duet without microphones, which was nice, as they were on opposite minarets.    The worse call was in Egypt, so distorted, it sounded like a car horn.|`|Ys5fxV1faa	I hear it every day on my way to work. I work in the shadow of the Empire State building and the Food vendors have become predominantly Muslim in the last 3 years. The call to prayer is commonly heard as well as other Islamic music coming from their stands. We all due respect to you and your faith we do not accept the teachings of Muhammad. Jesus told us the next big event would be his return. He and his Apostles did not speak at all regarding a prophet. In Islam Jesus is a prophet that failed his mission and it required Muhammad to fix it. For us prophets don't fail missions. Muhammad's teaching are not compatible with Christianity in any way. Under no circumstances do we consider ourselves polytheists. For us that the descriptions of Christian theology found in the Koran are false. The Koran describes the Trinity  concept as Father, Son and Virgin Mary. As you know this is not correct. Fragments have been found of the Christian and Jewish scriptures going back to the first century. Complete texts still exist going back to 300 AD and they match modern texts. At the same time the variations in Islamic texts vary greatly adding concern for us regarding your scriptures. I hope the God blesses you and guides you but we cannot accept your beliefs.|`|c5c157de44722b3201c46ab6e2a00078aa	yeah i kinda have considering i am... what of it?|`|aI1z8bQeaa	Huh I watched something similar to this in my Global Connections class on Islamic culture....Are you in my class?....STOP STALKING ME!

6ac1e229192b9d8283e40e971052ecc5aa	Hitler was a Roman Catholic, baptized into that religio-political institution as an infant in Austria. He became a communicant and an altar boy in his youth, and was confirmed as a "soldier of Christ" in that church. The worst doctrines of that church never left him. He was steeped in its liturgy, which contained the words, "perfidious Jew." This hateful statement was not removed until 1961. Perfidy means treachery.       Hitler was not sure who his paternal grandfather was, but it was probably either Johann Georg Hiedler or his brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler. There have been rumours that Hitler was one-quarter Jewish [1] and that his paternal grandmother, Maria Schicklgruber, had become pregnant after working as a servant in a Jewish household in Graz. During the 1920s, the implications of these rumours along with his known family history were politically explosive, especially for the proponent of a racist ideology. Opponents tried to prove that Hitler, the leader of the anti-Semitic Nazi Party, had Jewish or Czech ancestors. Although these rumours were never confirmed, for Hitler they were reason enough to conceal his origins. Soviet propaganda insisted Hitler was a Jew, though more modern research tends to diminish the probability that he had Jewish ancestors.|`|3227e97d4fa9bdf539da3fce222c0318aa	The big question is, on what did he put his faith?  1.

Encontrando O Poder na Fraqueza  Quero falar hoje sobre a palavra que se encontra em Filipenses 4:13  Quantas vezes ouvimos esse versiculo em momentos de dificuldade ou de desejo de conquista " Posso todas as coisas naquele que me Fortalece"  Hoje foi um dia especial na minha vida na presen?a do Senhor. Estava em busca de cura para algumas feridas da minha alma com rela??o a coisas do meu passado que ainda queriam refletir no meu presente. Em um momento em que meu cora??o queria gritar de t?o dificil que estava o meu confronto. Ao mesmo tempo que eu sabia que esta area precisava ser exposta, ela me doa muito. Comecei a orar, ent?o o Senhor come?ou a tirar do meu cora??o toda aquela dor. Senti como se o Senhor em abra?asse e me dissesse, eu estou te restaurando!!!!  Logo a noite fui para a Reuni?o de Jovens, em uma dinamica que foi feita chamada " a frase que nos une" As pessoas iam aleatriamente at a mesa e pegavam um papel com uma frase. Ent?o veio a minha surpresa. Dei de cara com Filipenses 4:13. Quando li o papel,fiquei pensando: S-nhor, o que quer falar comigo?  Muitas vezes limitamos o poder de Deus? na nossa for?a. Ficamos no "Tudo podemos" e nos esquecemos de quem? precisa agir para que possamos realmente alguma coisa. Este versiculo ele fala da limita??o humana, onde podemos crer que se Ele n?o?estiver a frente nada podemos fazer pq n?o haver for?a.Tudo que fazemos n?o  pq?temos for?a ou poder?para realizar. N?o  algo humano. Nossa for?a esta no sobrenatural. Vem de quem nos criou nos formou. E para que possamos receber a excelencia desse poder de D-us em ns , precisamos diminuir. Precisamos compreender Sua Grandeza, precisamos nos esvaziar da nossa for?a humana.  Enquanto achamos que podemos fazer, ou que quem est fazendo somos ns, o S-nhor n?o agir.  Como Paulo disse: "Seu poder se aperfei?oa na minha fraqueza". Paulo compreendia que para que ele pudesse realizar ele precisava desse poder vindo do Alto. O Poder Realizador de Deus  Que ns possamos a cada dia diminuir, para que realmente possamos todas as coisas Naquele que nos fortalece.

A execuss?o de um prisioneiro n?o representa um ato brbaro de judia??o, mas o cumprimento de uma lei.  Foi tambm oferecido a ele um capuz preto cujo qual ele recusou.  O condenado n?o deve ser menosprezado, insultado ou denegrido durante a execuss?o da pena capital. Um dos carrascos infringiu a lei quando conversou com ele e o mandou para o inferno. Isso  proibido n?o s pela lei islamica, mas por todos os pases que adotam esse tipo de puni??o.  Assista o filme "A espera de um milagre" e voc ver o procedimento adotado pelo estado americano nos casos de eletrocuss?o.  Todos os pases tambm adotam a leitura da senten?a, do motivo da puni??o e a descri??o do processo de execuss?o antes da execuss?o e isso foi feito com Sadam.  Muita gente pensa que no enforcamento, o ru  colocado confortavelmente sobre um cadafalso e depois a corda estica matando-o por asfixia, mas na realidade  dado um espa?o de corda e o cadafalso  alto ou profundo. Quando abre, o ru cai um tomb?o at ser freado pela corda que n?o est atraz da sua cabe?a, mas sim ao lado porque assim o pesco?o quebra no tranco da queda do ru e a morte  muito rpida.  As vezes o tranco  t?o forte que a cartida ou a jugular (veias do pesco?o) esplode impedindo a passagem de sangue para o crebro e se n?o ouver uma prote??o para o couro do pesco?o, o sangue pode esguichar para fora. porisso  colocada a prote??o.  Note que o rosto de Sadam estava com manchas avermelhadas. Elas s?o o resultado do rompimento de veias (provavelmente a cartida por causa da posi??o da corda ao lado esquerdo) que provocaram hemorragia interna e isso apressou a sua morte impedindo assim um grande perodo de agonia antes de morrer. Aparenta ser um ato brbaro, mas  um ato de compaix?o do carrasco.  Com a corda de lado, o Sadam deve ter demorado uns seis a sete minutos para morrer, Com o n da corda atraz do pesco?o, teria demorado pelo menos uns 20 minutos e sofrido muito mais, mas a lei o condenou  morte e n?o ao martrio.  Lembre-se que a famlia do condenado pagava para que os soldados romanos quebrassem as pernas dos crucificados para abreviar o seu sofrimento e que os centuri?es, quando ficavam de saco cheio de esperar o condenado agonizar por dias na cruz, espetavam uma lan?a em seu cora??o para "verificar" se ainda estavam vivos terminando assim de mat-los (provavelmente aconteceu com Jesus).  , meu caro... S?o macabras tcnicas de eutansia, mas ainda s?o aplicadas em muitas partes do mundo, inclusive na Inglaterra que  tida como um pas civilizado e aplica a forca como modo de execuss?o.  Se voc pensa que a inje??o letal  um processo "mais humano", saiba que ela est temporriamente suspensa em alguns estados americanos porque come?aram a haver falhas que fizeram condenados agonizarem por horas antes de morrerem.

Marta, boa tarde!!!    O Brasil  um dos paises mais multi-tinicos ou multi-raciais que existe em todos os continentes, pelo fato de termos herdado particularidades de ambas as culturas: A Amerndia, A Africana e a Europia. Por isso o Brasil tem uma cultura t?o rica, devido a diversidade tinica presentes na sua forma??o. Da podermos afirmar que o Brasil n?o apresenta uma cultura homognea, e sim um mosaico de diferentes vertentes culturais que juntos formam a cultura de nosso pas.    Obs:Embora seja um pas de coloniza??o portuguesa, outros grupos tnicos deixaram influncias profundas na cultura nacional, destacando-se os povos indgenas, os africanos, os italianos e os alem?es. As influncias indgenas e africanas deixaram marcas no ambito da msica, da culinria, no folclore e nas festas populares do Brasil.  evidente que algumas regi?es receberam maior contribui??o desses povos: os estados do Norte tm forte influncia das culturas indgenas, enquanto certas regi?es do Nordeste tm uma cultura bastante africanizada.

En cuanto a Jesus , indudable mente ,es un hijo muy especial, pero el nunca dijo que fuese el unigenito , ni mucho menos que fuese Dios, fueron sus seguidores los que urdieron esta patra?a ,incluso su ida al mundo espiritual en cuerpo y alma ,algo burdo e ilogico por cuanto Dios es espiritu y para estar en contacto con El , hay que ser espiritu tambien .Esta falacia es la culpable de que los cristianos le rindan culto al cuerpo material , pensando que la vida eterna sera material y no espiritual.  El demonio , simplemente no puede existir por cuanto es imposible que Dios haya creado a un ser que no solo le haga la competencia, si no que ademas, le de la contra ;como almas espirituales  somos :eternas ,perfectas y puras ,pero por estar ocupando un cuerpo material ,este la condiciona, al punto que llagamos a pensar que somos el cuerpo,pero cuando morimos ,nuestra alma queda liberada de ese cuerpo material entonces ,nuevamente decide entre :reencarnar o regresar al mundo espiritual ,aunque esto no es tan sencillo ,pues esta regido por la ley del karma.  El mundo material no es nuestra verdadera morada ,pues tan solo es un remedo de lo que es el mundo espiritual :eterno ,real y perfecto ; mientras que el mundo material es efimero , imperfecto y dual (luz-sombra;hambre-hartazgo;amor -odio y asi muchas mas dualidades) ;lo que nos debe preocupar no es como la pasamos mejor aqui ,si no que debemos hacer para regresar a casa, regresar al mundo espiritual.|`|95b7fb9d51e4f3c45940ace50faf6337aa	Jess es el Hijo preferido de Dios y por eso est sentado a la derecha del Padre.

El que sigue pecando es del diablo, pues el diablo siempre ha pecado, por eso el hijo de Dios vino para destruir las obras que hace el diablo. Ninguno que sea hijo de Dios contina en el pecado, pues tiene la nueva vida que Dios le dio y por esto no puede seguir pecando. Hay una forma de saber quin es hijo de Dios y quin es hijo del diablo: todo el que no pone en prctica el bien y no ama a su hermano, no  es de Dios.    Ahora mi pregunta para ti es: ?Te gustaria ser llamado hijo de Dios? si tu respuesta es "si", solo tienes que hacer lo que dice la Biblia, por medio de una peque?a oracion en donde reconozcas de corazon que eres un pecador pero que estas arrepentido de todo lo malo que haz hecho y que estas dispuesto a recibir a Jesus, creer en El y hacer lo que dice en su palabra (la Biblia).  Creeme es el mejor regalo que puedes recibir, y te aseguro que tu vida sera transformada.  Que Dios te bendiga.

God created man and woman to become one flesh which is consummated in the act of marital love.    Gen. 2:18  throughout the creation story, God says it is good seven times. But when God pointed out that man was alone, God says it is not good. God then created woman. Man and woman therefore belong together by Gods design, according to His natural and supernatural law.     Gen. 2:24  God created man and woman so that they could share communion. This communion is consummated in the marital act (which must be between a man and a woman). This communion is also a reflection of the eternal communion of the Blessed Trinity, who created man in His own image and likeness.     Gen. 19:24-28 - the Lord rained fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah as punishment for the sin of homosexuality. Homosexuality perverts Gods covenant with humanity.     Gen 13:13; 18:20: while homosexuals argue that the sin in Genesis 19 was the sin of inhospitality, these verses show that the Sodomites were evil and wicked people before the alleged sin of inhospitality. That is because the Sodomites were guilty of homosexuality, not inhospitality. In fact, 2 Pet 2:6:8 says that Lot witnessed their evil sexual practices day after day. The Sodomites sin was daily and pervasive.     Gen 19:5: this confirms that the Sodomites sin is homosexuality. Here, the Sodomites mistaken the two angels for men and, surrounding Lots house, ask to have sex with them. When the yell to Lot bring them out that we may know them, the Hebrew for to know (yadah) in Gen 19:5 means having sexual relations. See, for example, Gen 4:25 where yadah refers to sexual relations between Adam and Eve.     2 Pet 2:6-10: Peter also proves that the Sodomites were guilty of homosexuality. He says God condemned them for licentiousness and lust of defiling passion, which is where we get the title Sodomite for a homosexual. The Greek aselgeia anastrophes for lustful behavior is also found in Rom 13:13; Gal 5:19; Eph 4:19 and Jude 4.     Jude 7: Jude also confirms the Sodomites sin is homosexuality. Jude says they indulged in unnatural lust (Greek, ekporneusasai) and went after strange flesh (Greek, sarkos heteras) in reference to their homosexual sins.     2 Peter 2:4-6: Peter also reveals that the Sodomites are suffering in hell for their sins by comparing the Sodomites punishment to the eternal punishment of the evil angels. Just as God did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell, so He did the same with the Sodomites when He condemned them to extinction and made them an example to those who were to be ungodly.     Jude 5-7: Like Peter, Jude confirms that the Sodomites are in hell by saying that they had the same fate as the evil angels. Jude says just as the evil angels were condemned to hell, the Sodomites likewise (Greek, hos) acted immorally and are undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. Undergoing (Greek, upechousai) is a present participle which means their suffering is ongoing. See also the clear polarity between those who are saved (v.5) and those who are condemned (vv. 6-7,11,13).     Lev. 18:22, 29 - God commands a man never to lie with a male as with a female, or he will be cut off. This refers to supernatural death which is eternal separation from God. While the Old Covenant laws have been abrogated by the New Covenant, the Church has adopted their moral principles. Thus, the moral prohibitions on homosexuality still apply in the New Covenant, as Peter, Paul and Jude demonstrate.     Lev. 20:13 - God says that if a man lies with another man, he shall be put to death. From the very beginning, God has revealed that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered, unhealthy, and mortally sinful.     Deut. 22:5 - cross-dressing is also considered an abomination before God.     Matt. 19:6 - after referring to God's divine plan for man and woman, Jesus says a husband and wife become one flesh, which ultimately reflects God's union with humanity through the Church. Homosexual unions pervert this divine truth of Gods love for and union with the human race.     Rom. 1:26 - also, when a woman lies with another women (lesbianism), this is unnatural and a perversion. God wants His children to be pure and holy as He is holy. Paul condemns all homosexual acts, whether committed by men or women.     Rom. 1:27  Paul calls the practice of homosexuality shameless, unnatural and a perversity. It is contrary to the natural law, as it eviscerates the life-giving aspect of human sexuality and reduces it to a selfish, pleasure-seeking end.     1 Cor 6:9: Paul teaches that sodomites will not enter into the kingdom of God. The Greek word for sodomite (arsenokoites) literally means male copulation or male sexual relations. The Greek arsen means male and koites means coitus or |`|UBJkmXVhaa	Let me ask you this: what about homosexuality isn't "right" for you?      Do you believe it is immoral?  Something that is immoral is an act in defiance of morality, and is therefore a choice that is made.  You should ask your friends if they think their family member has chosen to be gay, knowing s/he will be discriminated against in society and ostracized by strangers.  Being gay is not a choice.  If it were, that would mean that each day, a person "decides" his/her orientation.  Did you decide to be straight?      But, that aside, remember that prop 8 is asking voters to define the governmental definition of marriage, and defining it in a way that discriminates.  This legislation has nothing to do with your church or the rules of your church.      As a Christian, it is your duty to treat others the way you would like to be treated, to be respectful, humble, unconditionally loving and forgiving.  I think God is more concerned that you show compassion to your fellow man--regardless of his orientation--than with you voting to make sure that a man can't visit his life partner in the hospital or get a tax break.  Prop 8 is not a proposal to legalize gay marriage.      Just saying. |`|gGmMw2vDaa	Don't be a hater, and you will not be seen as one. Hiding behind christianity as a justification for hatred will not work.|`|4jOi2KETaa	Jesus warned us in His word that the world will hate his followers. You can't change that. Vote Yes on 8 - that is what your conscience is telling you to do because that is right according to Christian faith. Your vote is private and if anyone asks what you voted you simply say that it's private. Voting Yes does not make you prejudice or hateful. No Christian obeying the Bible hates homosexuals we are to love them. Sin is sin whether it's a sexual sin or murder. The  only sin you go to hell for is the sin of rejecting Jesus and his salvation. But marriage since the beginning of time and in all cultures and languages of the whole world has always meant the union between a man and a woman. Homosexuals can have civil contracts and make up a word to describe the contract however they want - but they do not have the right to change the whole world's and God's meaning to suit them. It's hard to be the only Christian in a family. Your job is to love them and show by the example of your life God's love and forgiveness. If they asks questions about your faith answer them in love and leave it to the Holy Spirit to work on their heart. Stand firm in your faith, sister, even when it's hard. You are no threat to anyone - it's God's word. "For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through Him might be saved." Read John 3:16-21 you'll find what you've been talking about there. God bless you|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	Hey 2nd Commander,    God bless you, and His peace be with you.    Being Christian does not mean that you are a hater.  It never could because to be Christian is to be of love, to be of Jesus.  You're struggling with the same thing that I struggled with for a long time.  I used to worry and frustrate and guilt-trip myself to death trying to figure out if I'm doing the right thing with regard to my faith and what I see other people doing.  How do I share my faith with others and yet not offend them?  How do I show them Jesus when I know they won't like it because of the way they live and/or believe?  Am I supposed to hate them or love them?  If I love them, am I then condoning their behavior?    The answer is we are to love them.  Here's what I mean.    All people are God's children, even homosexuals.  We are to love and respect each other as God loves us.  What we don't have to love or accept is a person's sinful behavior and/or lifestyle.  We are not hating the person, we are hating the action.  There is a difference.  And we're supposed to hate any action that is sinful because God hates it, as those actions are unloving to each other and to Him.    Some of your friends are homosexual.  Fine.  Love them like you would anyone else on any normal day.  However, the line in the sand is drawn when it comes to accepting homosexual immorality.  It would be no different for drawing the same line for heterosexual immorality (adultery, fornication, incest, etc.).  Hate the sin, not the sinner.    For Prop 8, you are 100% correct that you should support it.  Gay marriage is a moral evil and you are showing great courage and faith in Jesus for standing up for Him and the sanctity of marriage with your vote.  God bless you.    You commitment and desire to keep God in the center of your life makes my heart smile.  Never stop.  You should pray to Him and pray often, hopefully everyday.  Draw on His love and strength.  Then bring that love to others.  That's our job as Christians - to love each other as Jesus loves us, even those who are not Christian.  Does that mean that sometimes love can hurt?  Yes.  Think of a parent disciplining a child that was disobedient.  The child broke a rule, the parent corrected them, and it hurt.  The parent correct themed, though, because they loved the child.  Even though it hurt, it was for love.      That's why sometimes people will not like us and say or do hateful things to us when we try to correct them, either by word or example, or we might even do the same to those who might correct us, but the thing to remember is that, above all, we must have love in our hearts.  Even if we're trying to help someone see Christ or correct a moral wrong, we must do it with love.    It was my education in my faith that taught me this.  I think everyone needs a solid education in their faith - learn where the bible came from, how to live a moral life, the Ten Commandments, etc.  That education has answered so many questions for me and is why I'm able to offer some hopefully helpful information you.  I encourage everyone to learn their faith.    I hope my answers were helpful.  Write anytime if you need.  God bless, take care, and keep the faith.          |`|kyTDQEWaaa	First, follow your conscience on gay marriage and prop 8, not your religion.    As far as your family go, relax, its family.

"Do not fear what they fear[a]; do not be frightened."[b] 15But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 16keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.        ADD 2:   I edited the line about biggotry because I realised it was too harsh a judgement on those who disagree with me on prop 8.  I guess I should have considered more carefully the line about "gentleness and respect". So ya see, we all make mistakes from time to time and no one can be a perfect Christian. But just continue to keep trying. God is still working with us all until we are perfected when we see him face to face.      So I say God bless you to all those who disagree with me about prop 8 and God bless you to the individuals who gave me  a bad rating... even if you can't see this. Acknowledge when you are wrong and bless those who are against you. I believe that is how to do right in God's eyes.|`|74N9S09aaa	Be thankful you are not living in Jesus' time when those that believed could not openly express themselves like you just did. What does God think? Show kindness and christian love towards everyone no matter what they do or say.  Do not let it affect the way you want to do things for God. Do not worry about your family. Ask for God's advice.|`|TBZK5q78aa	No matter what the person is... Gay, Satanists, Serial Killer, etc. You love them! But you hate the sin! God loves them all, but hates the sin. It's that simple. Love and forgive friends, family, and enemies.    And if it is disrespect to them, then just respect them by not throwing it in their face. That won't stop you from having a relationship with the Father though.    God bless!|`|MXX2q4aWaa	I understand your dilemma. John tells us in Revelation    And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.    He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.    And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.     It's time for us to turn our eyes to heaven, for Jesus is coming. All men have had plenty of opportunity to hear God's word and offer of redemption, but they will continue in their lust, so let them go. Do not even vote on this issue. Let it be known that these people freely elected to follow after their own lusts, but we didn't endorse it, nor will we prevent them any longer. They can deal with the Lord soon enough, but we must watch for the coming of Jesus Christ.   |`|XI1YvLDgaa	You have got to stop believing that everyone sees you as a hater.  Stand by your convictions and don't get caught up in the accusations against you.  Do you love people who are gay,straight, all races and social levels as we are called to do as Christians?  If so, then refuse to listen to the negative and tune up you response with scripture and your honesty.|`|612f63e9175a526652c97a470fd55b3faa	First you can't be a Christian and be a "hater".  If you read my posts I often slam those who would call themselves Christian and are overly judgmental and hateful.    However, that has no relation to being able to calmly articulate your beliefs.  The  Bible clearly states that homosexuality is sin.  The kicker is that it also says that being disrespectful to your parents is sin and gluttony as well.    See, we are all equal before God.  This fact keeps us humble and keeps us from feeling that we are better or worse.    You never have to excuse sin or pretend that it is not wrong.  You are not looking for people to attack like some on here might do.      Read my questions and you will see how I feel about this.  If someone sees me as a "hater" they are simply ignorant and judgmental about me.  I am a staunch defender of any group that is oppressed.      That said I am not going to vote for any law that violates biblical tenants.  This would be asking you to become something you are not and to be dishonest regarding your beliefs.|`|AoyC3Xi9aa	Without Christ, souls will perish. That is not my mere opinion. It is what God Himself said in His Word. If you hold the Word of God as true, then you know that the only way to salvation is through Christ. That means that if you love your parents, you will share the good news with them. Would it be loving to see someone walk off a cliff and not attempt to warn them? No. Well, lost people are walking off into hell. The only loving thing to do is to warn them.     Does this mean we have to be nasty or cruel? No. We are always to plead with people in a loving fashion but not compromise the truth. We are not here to condemn. We are here to simply explain to people what the Bible says about their spiritual condition. We are messengers. If people get angry with the message, their main problem is ultimately with God, not us.     Families are going to be divided (Matthew 10:34-35). We are going to be persecuted for our faith in Christ. Matthew 5:11 is just one such passage. "Because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." - John 15:16-19 Scripture has a TON of similar passages.    Paul calls the message of the Gospel foolish and offensive to those that are lost in 1 Corinthians. In other words, when we tell people the truth, they will hate it and hate us for telling them.     As far as voting, we do have Biblical principles to guide us which state homosexuality is wrong. I too have many gay friends and lost friends and family, but we are obligated to lovingly tell these people the truth. Without the truth, they will perish. We cannot be selfish and keep it to ourselves.|`|AA10945101	You can't...some people are going to view you as a hater no matter what you do.  Some people did (and still do) view Jesus as a hater...why should you be any different?  Didn't Jesus promise that we would be hated for following him?    Having said that, let me make it clear that knowing you'll be hated does NOT give you a license to be hateful!  More importantly, you should not allow you fear of being hated cause you to "hide your light under a bushel".      I've never been afraid to let someone know I'm a Christian...and I've had many homosexual friends in my life.  I think the real issue is how you view "sinners"...through the lens of your own perception or through God's eyes?     ...and then ask yourself this question...how did Jesus respond to "sinners" (keeping in mind that he already knew what sins EVERY person committed before they revealed them to him)?      Did he confront them all and tell them what they were doing was wrong?  How many times did he run after someone that walked away from him trying to convince them that they needed to turn away from their sin? How many times did he condemn someone to hell when they confessed a sin to him?    The answers are "no", "never", and "never"...and if you remember that, it is a lot easier to be open about your Christianity without provoking others to hate!  I have had many homosexual friends...and they all know I'm a Christian...and because I treat them with love and respect both before AND after I learn about their sexual orientation, none have hated me because of my faith.  Most have, at some point after learning I was a Christian, asked me what I thought about homosexuality and I always strive to speak the truth in love...just as Jesus did.      I think the way they chose to act on their sexuality is wrong and that they have and will continue to suffer for that choice...just as I have made (and continue to make) poor decisions that cause me to suffer...and while I would spare them that pain, it is is not my place to judge them for anything.  ...and then I continue to treat them with love and respect!    Re: Prop 8, after reading the specific wording, I think I would choose NOT to vote either way.  I couldn't cast a vote to support denying the right of gays to marry because that is discrimination and it is wrong...the way I see it, God didn't give me the authority to enforce his laws on others and I can't in good conscience do so.  On the other hand, I couldn't cast a vote in favor of extending marriage rights to homosexuals because I believe that is a vote in favor of continued discrimination in favor of married people.  As a single person, I object to the ways our government discriminates against me because of my choice to remain single...and I can't see how it would be in MY best interests to increase the number of people that already benefit from that marriage-related discrimination I'd like to see eliminated entirely!    I think the solution to your problem is to feel completely free to let others know that you are a Christian and testify to the ways knowing Jesus has changed YOUR life...and wait until you are asked before you start offering your "Christian opinion" about their life!      ...and even when you are asked, always remember that their sins are NOT the problem!  Convincing someone to stop doing something you view as sinful will NOT lead to their salvation...keep pointing them to the love of God poured out on the whole world through Jesus and trust that when they can accept that they need that love, HE is perfectly capable of working to eliminate the sin in their life!|`|7aef327916869354b0b11717998fe8b8aa	*** REAL ANSWER ****    What you are feeling is the feeling of persecution, making you feel like your beliefs are not welcomed, that you some how are evil or a fool for believing them.  But be strong God told us that this was going to happen.  Christians arround the world are persecuted some to death, by those who want to impose their beliefs on us.  Impose their beliefs on us? Yes.  Think about it, how about them feeling bad for offending you by their lifestyle? their sinful ways? Their ungodly beleifs?  But that never happens, shouldn't they be the ones feeling like haters for flaunting their homosexuality when they know you don't agree with it? owhy should you be silent and they not?   It is a double standard, they want to impose their liberal lifestyle and views on us by intimidating us, making us feel like we are offending them... nest time try to tell them their choices and their beliefs offend you and you will soon see liberals tolerance is a one way street.    You are not a hater, as long as you hate the sin not the sinner, as long as you don't want to kill them but save them, not belittle them but enlighten them.  They will acuse you of being ahater, narrow minded, brainwashed fool.  But question their beliefs and soon their mask will fall off and you'll know they just wanted to impose their beleifs on you.    Cheer up Jesus loves us, we are going to heaven, so what if the world hates us, Jesus told us so from the begining and its worth it.|`|GiePTBmjaa	Just because you disagree with others, it does not mean you hate them.  The Bible tells us to love all mankind, even our enemies, but it also tells us to hate sin.  You aren't hating the person, you are hating the sin.  Only the liberals who follow satan will call you names and put you down for taking a stand for what you believe is right and pleasing to God and they will be the first ones to twist what you believe to make you look like a hatemonger.   My question is why do they have a right to believe what they want and they can be outspoken about it but when you do it, it is suddenly wrong?  Double standards don't float with me.  If they have a right to their opinion, why shouldn't I have a right to mine?  The difference is I never call them a hater because they disagree with me.  Liberals always will.    Do you think murdering another person is ok?  Do you think it's ok for someone to go rape another?  Is it ok for someone to be a pedophile and rape or harm children?  Is it ok for someone to steal from others?  Is it alright for someone to get drunk?  Is it ok for a person to beat up another person?    Are you afraid to say no to any of those?  Does that make you a hater of the person because you believe all of them are wrong?  Of course not.  They are all sins and all things God wants us to avoid and take a stand against.    Support Prop8 and know you are pleasing God for following His commands.

Si lo que buscas es algo personal con Dios, no te deberas de preocupar tanto en que religin, creencias o costumbres seguir, el no te pide que seas miembro de ningn "club" para llegar a el, solo busca un corazn sincero, ya que ests bien con el, tu vestuario y forma de vivir se acoplaran a lo que el personalmente te haga sentir.|`|M3V39s13aa	LOS QUE SE CAEN CUANDO EL PASTOR LE PONE LA MANO ALGUNOS FINGEN CAER PARA NO QUEDAR EN VERGUENZA CON LOS OTROS RELIGIOSOS, ALGUNOS SE CAEN PORQUE LOS ESPIRITUS DEL ERROR HACEN DE LAS SUYAS Y HACEN FOCO PARA QUE LA PERSONA SE CAIGA O EN TODO CASO LOS DEMONIOS SE METEN AL DECODIFICADOR(CEREBRO)Y HACEN QUE SE CAIGAN Y COMO TU DECODIFICADOR (CEREBRO) NO SE ABRIO AL PASTOR POR ESO NO TE PASO NADA CUANDO LA GENTE SE ABRE AL PASTOR ES MAS FACIL DE QUE LOS ESPIRITUS DEL ERROR Y LOS DEMONIOS HAGAN DE LAS SUYAS Y LO DE LA CARNE TE DEBIERON HABER RESPETADO NADIE PUEDE VIOLAR EL LIBRE ALBEDRIO DE NADIE|`|FQn4pdBHaa	cita:  luego puso su mano en mi frente con la intencion de que me cayera y no paso nada, no senti nada, el siguio empujando hasta que no pudo conmigo y se fue        JAJAJA TOTALMENTE CIERTO|`|BlGEwqZPaa	En realidad todo este asunto del diablo se deriva de un pasaje de la primera carta del apostol juan que mas o menos dice as:  "No amis al mundo ni las cosas que estn en el mundo. Si alguno ama al mundo, el amor del Padre no est en l;  porque todo lo que hay en el mundo -los deseos de la carne, los deseos de los ojos y la soberbia de la vida- no proviene del Padre sino del mundo. 17 Y el mundo est pasando, y sus deseos; pero el que hace la voluntad de Dios permanece para siempre".  De esta manera, si algo no es explicitamente cristiano, significa que es del mundo, y por ende no es de Dios sino del diablo, el punto es que todo convierte en una especie de caceria de brujas al tratar de encontrar nexos diabolicos o mundanos en algo que muchas veces nisiquiera es pecaminoso o diabolico;  incluso algunos sectores cristianos condenan el rock cristiano (aprovado por otras congregaciones) solo por el hecho de que el rock tiene ritmo marcado y que ese ritmo fue tomado de la msica etnica africana que en esencia se elaboraba para adorar dioses paganos. etc ,etc, etc, en fin, lo que los cristianos debemos entender es que en vez de andar condenando y juzgando las cosas a nuestro alrededor simplemente debemos enfocarnos en aplicar las ense?anzas de Jess y no hacer de la religin un yugo y mucho menos presentar a Jess como no debes, no puedes, esta prohibido, cada cual leyendo a conciencia la biblia sabr que es bueno y que es malo; y sobre todo desconfiar de quien se autoproclame como el verdadero poseedor de la verdad.  La verdad esta en Jess, pero siempre hay que dudar de quien presuma poseer la verdadera interpretacin de lo dicho por Jesus, en otras palabras no hay que comer entero, los cristianos tambien deben aprender a tener un pensamiento crtico, pues como dira Einstein todo es relativo.|`|VS1XTwFpaa	que feo pero eso ya rebasa el fanatismo|`|ZUUi15c8aa	Porque es mas facil echarle la culpa al tarado del diablo, y no reconocer que uno es tentado CUANDO de nuestra propia concupiscencias (deseo,apetito,placer) es atrado y seducido (Stg 1:14), y uno peca;    En cuanto a lo material Juan 2:15 dice: no ameis al mundo ni a las cosas que estan el mundo, aqui mismo te lo dice, lo errado es amarlo,  pues estamos en este mundo pero no somos de aqui.

La ciencia no necesariamente refuta a la religin, pero s nos permite dar a la religin su lugar adecuado y no confundir creencias religiosas con verdades objetivas.

El papado ms corto en los tiempos modernos fue el de Juan Pablo l, predecesor del actual Pontfice, quien slo estuvo 33 das al frente de la Iglesia.-  Durante su pontificado, el Papa Juan Pablo II ha:  -- viajado un total de 1.247,613 kilmetros,  3,24 veces la distancia de la Tierra a la Luna, en viajes papales dentro y fuera de Italia  -- realizado 104 viajes fuera de Italia  -- visitado 129 pases y territorios diferentes  -- realizado 146 viajes en Italia  -- realizado 301 visitas a parroquias en Roma  -- pasado 822 das, o ms de dos a?os y tres meses, fuera del Vaticano.  -- ledo ms de 20.000 discursos  -- ledo casi 100.000 pginas de discursos  -- celebrado ms de 1.160 audiencias generales en el Vaticano a las que han asistido ms de 17,64 millones de personas.  -- emitido ms de 100 documentos importantes, incluyendo 14 encclicas, 45 cartas apostlicas y 14 exhortaciones apostlicas.  -- beatificado a 1.338 personas, ms que todos sus predecesores en los ltimos cuatro siglos juntos  -- canonizado a 482 personas, ms que todos sus predecesores en los ltimos cuatro siglos juntos  -- nombrado 231 cardenales, de los que 183 siguen vivos y 119 tienen menos de 80 a?os y pueden participar en el cnclave que elegir a un nuevo Papa. De estos 119, 116 han sido nombrados por Juan Pablo II y slo tres por Pablo VI, cuyo pontificado fue de 1963 a 1978.-  -- reunido con ms de 1.590 jefes de Estado o de Gobierno.

Esto por un lado... por el otro estn aquellos que, al ver que no creen en El Se?or, reaccionan as por intolerancia, como diciendo "maldito ateo, por qu ca**jo no crees en Dios?, ?es que acaso no quieres salvarte?", o sino porque antes le hayan tratado de cambiar su F para hacerlo creyente pero la persona fu muy dura, entonces se ve nuevamente la actitud de entre comillas ms arriba :S  Yo en lo personal suelo dar indirectas inocentes a un profe mo de dibujo que es ateo: El caso es que somos cinfilos, y pues como se viene Transformers solemos decir "ojal que est este robot, ojal que a este lo dise?en de tal forma" y as, y cuando alguno de estos deseos sale a nuestro gusto suelo decir intencionalmente en su presencia "Uhh, gracias a Dios lo hicieron as", y le llevo siempre la contra, slo que de buena onda claro, es slo para molestarlo con la verdad :P.

Muchas personas en este afn de evangelizar atacan y "satanizan" a todo aquel  que tiene una creencia o no creencia diferente y es lgico que si un ateo (y tambin un creyente) se siente atacado va a reaccionar de la misma forma.

Esta actitud sobre algo fundamental de su credo, indica un desconocimiento total del espritu que lo anima, con lo que se incapacitan ellos mismos como cristianos y como portadores y comunicadores de su religin.

He venido a poner al hombre contra su padre, a la hija contra su madre y a la nuera contra su suegra; de modo que los enemigos de cada cual sern sus propios parientes.    Con esto Cristo se refiere a que por seguirlo a El y a sus doctrinas va a haber divisiones en familias y en la sociedad porque sus seguidores van a encontrar oposicion de mucha gente y quizas con mayor seguridad de parte de su gente mas cercana que le dira que deje de lado esas ideas cristianas.    Para ver claramente esto, lee este y otros foros de discusion sobre religion y veras que se cumple...

De partida , citas un pasaje del nuevo testamento y estas ms perdido que Chino en la Antrtica, ds pena, de verdad , siempre lo mismo "los necios"el papelon lo hacen ellos.  Peor an si vs ms atrs, al antiguo testamento, si no eres capaz con el N. T. Ante todo debes ubicarte en el tiempo, cronlogico, hitrico, religioso y poltico, esa es solo una parte, despus hay que considerar, tradiciones, costumbres e   idiomas, y para que voy a seguir si esto no es para ti y por lo dems no ests preparado para semejante cosa ,  ?vs a decir que , no ?. Si realmente supieras algo no hablaras tantas estupideces, pero el necio habla, lo contrario del sabio ese observa y guarda silencio, espera el momento que le corresponde para abrir la boca , muchas veces dice poco  , pero encierra un tremendo contenido.  ?por qu no te frenas y tratas de cambiar, intentas aprender?  antes que nada debieras saber que es bueno ser siempre un aporte y buscar la sabidira, dije sabidura , no tener conocimiento.los que prevalecen son los tipos sabios, ellos se quedan los dems solo pasan."no existen".    Crees t que esas naciones o pueblos con rtulos de creyentes religiosos o cristianos segn t, eran tales.  me refiero a que eran  personas convertidas ?sabes lo que es eso? ?convertidas? osea para que entiendas, as como,  Pablo, Pedro, y otros , a estos los mataron , ellos no mataron a nadie.  Antes de seguir y de terminar tambin te aclaro , que no estoy defendiendo a ninguna religion en especial, al contrario, estoy en contra de toda costumbre y tradicin religiosa, incluso en el presente ni siquiera me reuno con ningn grupo religioso, pero me molestan los estpidos impetuosos, imprudentes, prepotentes y absolutos que se sienten due?os del mundo, no niego que soy creyente y quizas a mi manera por decirlo de alguna forma, pero t con esa actitud, perdoname si perdoname, a otro perro con ese hueso.Bueno por ahora me quedo aqu, coloca empe?o ,intenta revertir t actitud, mira que no existe ciego ms tonto, que el ciego , que sn serlo, no quiere ver.-    corleone.-|`|hRFKGCEaaa	no no sabia y tu?|`|bBLiaSpNaa	Tomaron el nombre de cristianos, pero no significa que lo eran.

5B0LMGHHaa	Il n'y a aucune justification  la galanterie. Elle ne devrait mme pas exister. Si l'homme -tout comme la femme- fait preuve de respect envers l'autre sexe (ou mme envers son propre sexe), il n'y a aucune raison objective pour que l'un soit trait d'une fa?on diffrente de l'autre si ce n'est (n'tait ?) pour "gommer" certaines ingalits.    Toutefois, certaines recettes ressortant de la "galanterie" (ouvrir la porte, monter ou descendre les escaliers, ouvrir la portire d'une voiture...) peuvent re assimiles  des mesures de scurit. Une mre (et un pre aussi, je l'espre) aura les mmes attitudes envers son enfant, par exemple. Toute personne peut appliquer ces "recettes" aux personnes ages quel que soit leur sexe.    La femme serait donc une personne "faible" ? Est-ce bien si s?r ? Je ne le crois pas.    En conclusion,  la place de la "galanterie", je rclame pour tout le monde les marques de courtoisie que chacun mrite.|`|4AmpJgSEaa	Tout a fait d'accord, je porte la femme au mme niveau que les hommes et donc je considre que je n'ai pas a faire plus preuve de galanterie pour une femme que pour un homme.

Aqui en Colombia la gente cuando se ven expuestas a una situacion extrema dicen "virgen santisima", en cierta forma me parece similar al "oh my god", pero por obvias razones la equivalencia no es aplicable en todos los casos, seria innaudito que en la cama como expresion de placer uno dijera "virgen santisima", eso no seria erotico, mas bien seria como comico y de mal gusto.|`|Y2j11GA0aa	Una vez me acost con una chava que se puso a llorar en el acto, me saco de onda, me puse la ropa y me fui.

La superficie interior est ricamente vascularizada y debido a que su base est unida al pie, permite la ventilacin. Tienen una concha globulosa helicoidal y 2 pares de tentculos retrctiles, 1 par provisto de ojos y el otro tctil. La concha de la mayora de los caracoles terrestres se arrolla casi siempre en sentido dextrgiro, es decir en el mismo sentido que las agujas del reloj, aunque en algunas especies su concha lo hace en sentido inverso, levgiro.    Helix aspersa caracol comn de jardn.   Achatina fulica caracol gigante africano: fue presentado como comestible en la II Guerra Mundial. En el momento actual se le considera una plaga para la agricultura y tiene algunos efectos da?inos para la salud de los humanos.   Helix aspersa maxima.   Helix pomati.   Helix lucorum.      Caractersticas fsicas  [editar]Los caracoles se mueven como los gusanos alternando contracciones y elongaciones de su cuerpo, con una proverbial lentitud. Producen mucus para ayudarse en la locomocin reduciendo as la friccin. Esta mucosidad contribuye a su regulacin trmica, tambin reduce el riesgo del caracol ante las heridas, las agresiones externas, notablemente las bacterianas y fungicas, ayudndoles a mantenerse lejos de insectos potencialmente peligrosos como las hormigas. El mucus sirve adems al caracol para desembarazarse de ciertas substancias como los metales pesados y entra tambin en la composicin de la cubierta.    Cuando se retrae en su concha, secreta un tipo especial de mucosidad que se polimeriza, para cubrir la entrada de su caparazn con una estructura llamada oprculo. Es similar en algunas especies de babosas, algo parecido a una cscara debajo de su piel superior para prevenirlas de desecarse por completo. El oprculo de algunos caracoles tiene un olor agradable cuando es quemado, por eso a veces es usado como un constituyente del incienso. Este oprculo suele ser fino en las especies terrestres y en otras como las marinas, muy mineralizado.    Descontando los caracoles marinos, en invierno o en estaciones secas, muchas especies terrestres o de agua dulce, hibernan en su concha sellndose con el oprculo, que le sirve de proteccin para la hibernacin y que es destruido en la primavera o cuando el entorno se hace ms hmedo. Algunas especies se renen e hibernan en grupos mientras que otras se entierran antes de la hibernacin.    El caracol de tierra ms grande es el Caracol Gigante Africano (Achatina Fulica) que puede medir hasta 3 dm; Pomacea maculata (Familia Ampullariidae), o el caracol de Manzana Gigante es el caracol ms grande de agua dulce, con su tama?o que alcanza los 15 cm de dimetro y ms de 600 g de peso. El ms grande de todos los caracoles es el Syrinx aruanus, una especie marina que vive en Australia.    La concha del caracol es un ejemplo de la representacin de Fi en la naturaleza. Las formas de las conchas de ciertos caracoles de mar (Conus, Cymbiola) estn constituidas por la versin biolgica de un autmata celular.    Como el caracol crece, tambin su caparazn . Un caracol cerrar una seccin de su concha y a?adir una nueva cmara al crecer, cada cmara ser ms grande que la anterior por un factor constante. Como resultado, la concha formar una espiral logartmica. En algn momento, el caracol construye un reborde alrededor de la apertura del caparazn, deja de crecer, y comienza a reproducirse.    La concha del caracol y las cubiertas de los huevos estn compuestas principalmente de carbonato de calcio como los caparazones de otros moluscos. A causa de esto, requieren una buena cantidad de calcio en su dieta y ambiente acuoso para producir una concha fuerte. Una carencia de calcio, o una fluctuacin en el nivel de pH en su entorno, probablemente har que su caparazn sea fino, se raje, o tenga agujeros. Por lo general un caracol puede reparar su da?o de la concha con el tiempo, si sus condiciones de vida mejoran, pero algn deterioro lo bastante grave podra ser fatal para el caracol. Es por eso que los caracoles se desarrollan mejor en las zonas calizas. Donde el Carbonato Clcico escasea, algunas especies faltan y otras, las ms adaptables, tragan piedrecitas que contienen cal, roen huesos o pintura caliza o plantas ricas en calcio.       Hibernacin  [editar]Los caracoles hibernan durante el invierno (normalmente desde octubre hasta finales de abril). Tambin pueden hibernar en verano en condiciones de sequa, a esto se le conoce como estivacin. Para mantenerse hmedos durante la hibernacin, sellan su apertura de la concha con una capa seca de mucosidad llamada epifragma.       Reproduccin  [editar]Los caracoles son hermafroditas, producen tanto espermatozoides como vulos. Deben acoplarse porque no pueden autofecundarse. Estn equipados de un pene y del rgano receptivo correspondiente. Otros, como los Caracoles Manzana o Ampullariidae, son macho o hembra.    Los caracoles de jardn, por parejas, se inseminan el uno al otro, para internamente fertilizar sus vulos. Generalmente en la primavera y el oto?o de las zonas templadas, mientras el tiempo permanece caliente y hmedo. La reproduccin se hace generalmente de noche y dura de promedio 4 horas. Se lanzan el uno al otro una saeta espiral de carbonato clcico, que desaparece en el interior del receptor, donde se disuelve y libera el esperma.    Despus hacen un agujero, enterrando sus huevos algunos centimetros bajo la superficie de la capa frtil. Pasados 12 das (hasta 1 mes segn las condiciones climatolgicas), estos huevos eclosionan y surgen las caracolitas. Cada puesta consiste en|`|cba1a9b483be00ef27421d9131c764efaa	?Sabes la diferencia entre lstima y lastima?  20 centimetros jeje.

Paz amigo|`|8bebb9a101c3507169b0f401517f098faa	Jesus de Nazar esteve na Terra h quase dois mil anos atrs, deixando-nos seu Evangelho como roteiro de ilumina??o interior. Sua tarefa junto a ns, contudo, n?o se resume queles poucos anos de sua prega??o; ao contrrio, como responsvel pela educa??o dos Espritos que habitam este mundo, enviou, em todos os tempos e a todas as culturas, mensageiros com o propsito de esclarecer e orientar os homens.    Dentre esses emissrios, destacou-se Moiss, incumbido de dirigir o povo hebreu nos primrdios de sua organiza??o social e poltica, preparando o terreno, para que, mais tarde, ele mesmo, Jesus, viesse trazer sua mensagem. Moiss consolidou a cren?a no Deus nico (1a revela??o), base sobre a qual Jesus edificaria seu ensino de que esse Deus  Pai de todas as criaturas, ama-nos a todos igualmente e nos reserva futuro glorioso de plenitude e paz (2a revela??o).    Seria um grande erro, pois, pensarmos que a tarefa do Mestre se limitasse queles tempos da Palestina. Ele esteve atento aos destinos humanos desde o princpio e sabia que n?o seria fcil para os homens o caminho da evolu??o espiritual, por isso prometeu que enviaria mais tarde um Consolador (Jo?o, cap. XIV, vv. 15 a 17 e 26),  para relembrar o que Ele dissera e nos ensinar todas as coisas que n?o poderiam ser entendidas naquele tempo. O Consolador prometido por ele seria, pois, a 3a revela??o.    Em sua promessa, Jesus menciona o Esprito de Verdade que o mundo n?o v e n?o conhece, mas que viria para estar eternamente entre ns. Analisando o texto da promessa, percebemos que Jesus j antecipava os descaminhos do homem em rela??o  mensagem que estava deixando. Se algum seria enviado, para lembrar coisas que Jesus dissera, isso ocorreria, porque os homens teriam esquecido esses ensinos; e se viria para ensinar todas as coisas,  porque Jesus n?o pode ensinar tudo quando esteve aqui, por faltarem aos homens os pr-requisitos para o entendimento mais profundo da realidade.    Se o Consolador viria para estar eternamente conosco, ele n?o poderia se apresentar como um ser encarnado, porque o corpo fsico  perecvel. Deduz-se, portanto, que o Esprito de Verdade precisaria de outra maneira de estar conosco, sem ser pela encarna??o em um corpo material. A Histria mostra que as religi?es institudas pelo homem com base nos Evangelhos cometeram muitos desvios interpretativos e desenvolveram a??es que est?o muito distantes da fraternidade pregada por Jesus. N?o precisamos lembrar aqui as guerras religiosas e os tribunais da inquisi??o que derramaram tanto sangue. O fato  que institui??es t?o afastadas do roteiro tra?ado pelo Mestre n?o teriam condi??es de receber o Consolador, motivo pelo qual ele teria que aparecer nos cenrios do mundo fora das igrejas edificadas pelos homens. Todo esse raciocnio  importante para nos possibilitar o reconhecimento de que a promessa de Jesus j foi cumprida e o Consolador est entre ns.|`|VJJhFOLeaa	Gra?a e Paz meu irm?o.  Gnesis 1.26 (   FA?AMOS o homem a nossa imagem e semelhan?a  )  Gnesis 3.22  (  Eis que o homem se tornou como um de NS, conhecedor do bem e do mal  ).  Gnesis 11.7  (  Vinde, DES?AMOS e CONFUNDAMOS ali a sua linguagem  )  Isaas 6.8  (  A quem enviarei e quem h de ir por NS  ).  Podemos observar que as passagens supracitadas nos d?o a  entender que ou at implicam que Deus existe como mais de uma pessoa.  N?o sabemos quantas pessoas s?o, mas no Novo Testamento fica bem mais claro ao tocante do numero de pessoas.  Mateus 28.19 (  Ide e fazer discpulo por todo o mundo, batizando-os em nome do Pai, Filho e do Espirito Santo  ).  2  Corntios 13.13  (  A gra?a do Senhor Jesus Cristo e o amor de Deus e a comunh?o do Esprito Santo sejam com todos vs  ).  Mateus 3.16-17, fala claramente do encontro da Santssima Trindade, ao se referir ao batismo de Jesus Cristo.  A palavra trindade;  "tri-unidade ou trs-em-um,  n?o se encontra na Bblia Sagrada.  Podemos definir a doutrina da Trindade do seguinte modo: Deus existe como trs pessoas, Pai, Filho e Esprito Santo e cada um e plenamente  Deus.  O fato de Deus ser trs pessoas significa que o Pai n?o  o Filho; s?o pessoas distintas. Significa que o Pai n?o  o Esprito Santo  , mas s?o pessoas distintas. E significa que o Filho n?o  o Esprito Santo.  Podemos observar que s?o trs pessoas distintas entre si, mas com as mesmas essncias Divinas.  Feliz 2009.  Paz do Senhor.|`|wCDn1ZmXaa	A histria eclesistica (isto , da igreja) prova que a trindade N?O ERA crida pelos crist?os primitivos, seguidores de Jesus, nem pelos seus apstolos.    A trindade foi uma doutrina que foi desenvolvida MUITO TEMPO DEPOIS, somente quando adentrou os territrios tomados pelas filosofias gregas e doutrinas mitolgicas dos romanos.    E Roma, no intuito de conciliar todos os seus povos dominados, TEVE de fazer vrios conclios para PADRONIZAR a doutrina.    Na prpria Bblia tem um exemplo de povos que acreditavam que Deus poderiam se fazer homens, e idolatraram Paulo e Barnab!    Se os seguidores de Jesus eram endeusados, imagina o MESTRE deles !!!!    E assim se espalhou a ideia entre algumas comunidades crist?s de que Jesus era Deus.    E como a maioria seguia a doutrina original, que era na realidade, apenas uma discidencia judaica, eles criam num Deus NICO, da mesma forma como os Judeus sempre acreditaram, ent?o, isso gerou uma polmica. Se Jesus  Deus, como pode existir dois deuses se na Torh diz que Deus  um s???    E ficaram nesse impasse teolgico.  E nem tocaram no assunto Esprito Santo.    Precisou mais um sculo para eles discutirem se o Esprito Santo era Deus ou n?o.    E depois de muito debate, e bate boca, bate cabe?a, funde cuca, etc... os caras acharam que o Esprito Santo fosse Deus tambm.    A ficaram numa situa??o incomoda, pois na Torah, e nos ensinamentos de Jesus e de Paulo, Deus era um s!    A tiveram de recorrer a filosofia grega pra buscar apoio intelectual pra sair desse dilema.    E ent?o, depois de muitas elocubra??es, eles conseguiram uma sada para a crise.  E desenvolveram a doutrina da trindade, em que n?o eram trs deuses, mas sim, UM DEUS S, porm trino.  Seria um OVO s!  Mas dentro desse ovo, haviam TRS gemas!    N?o s?o trs ovos, mas UM OVO S.  S?o trs gemas, da mesma natureza, da mesma substancia, da mesma origem imersos na MESMA CLARA, DENTRO DO MESMO OVO.    E assim estabeleceram que a Trindade estava IMPLCITO nas escrituras, e foram buscar em Gnesis a frase "Fa?amos o homem a nossa imagem e semelhan?a", bem como no episdio da torre de Babel, onde Deus disse que desceria para confundir a lngua deles: "Eia, des?amos e confundamos a lngua dos homens"...    Em Isaas, eles buscaram o texto de Isaas  6:8 onde diz assim:  "A quem enviarei, e quem ir por ns? Ent?o disse eu: Eis-me aqui, envia-me a mim."    E afirmam que esse texto significa que Deus  trs pessoas formando uma nica divindade, em que o Deus Pai pergunta entre os trs, qual dos outros dois ele enviaria, e no caso, a segunda pessoa, que seria o Filho, ou Jesus, aceitou ser enviado a terra, para nascer como homem chamado Jesus, e se sacrificar para salvar a humanidade de seus pecados.     essa a interpreta??o dos BURROS CATLICO E MAIS AINDA DOS BURROS EVANGLICOS.    Usam um texto de Mateus onde diz que o Messias seria chamado de Emanuel, que significa Deus Conosco, e assim entedem que isso  uma declara??o da divindade de Jesus, porque ele seria DEUS CONOSCO, o Deus feito homem. E associam com Isaas 9:6 onde o texto diz que o futuro messias judaico seria chamado de Pai Eterno e de Deus Poderoso ou Deus Forte, conforme a tradu??o bblica que se usa.    E deturpam os outros textos do NT para apoiar essa cren?a.  Desvirtuam Jo?o 10:30, onde Jesus diz que ele e o Pai s?o um.    Dizem que  declara??o de trindade, porque ele e o Pai s?o um Deus s!    Mas Jesus n?o disse "somos um" nesse sentido.  O que Jesus disse com a express?o "somos um"  o sentido que ele explicou em Jo?o 17:22.    Ele disse:  "E eu lhes dei a glria que a mim me deste, para que sejam um, como ns somos um;"    Ele disse que os discpulos DEVERIAM SER UM, ASSIM COMO ELE [Jesus] ERA UM COM O PAI.    Ou seja, nicos em propsitos, nicos em objetivos, em comportamento, em ideal, etc...    Paulo deixa claro o sentido de ser UM S, repare:    Romanos  12:5   assim ns, embora muitos, somos um s corpo em Cristo,    I Corintios  10:17   Pois ns, embora muitos, somos um s p?o, um s corpo; porque todos participamos de um mesmo p?o.      Paulo apenas REFOR?OU o que Jesus disse em Jo?o captulo 17.  REPARE no que Jesus disse:    Jo?o  17:23   ... para que eles sejam perfeitos em unidade...    "Eles" a quem Jesus se refere no texto em quest?o s?o os discpulos.    Em Efsios  4:3, Paulo fala para TODOS OS CRIST?OS GUARDAREM O MESMO ESPRITO, ou seja, se manterem no mesmo mpeto e conduta inicial, sem se desviar dos propsitos.    Disse ele: "procurando diligentemente guardar a unidade do Esprito no vnculo da paz."    Note que nesta tradu??o Jo?o Ferreira de Almeida, os tradutores escrevem "esprito" com letra inicial MAIUSCULA !  Pretendem dizer com isso que o esprito mencionado seja o Esprito Santo, a terceira pessoa da trindade, sendo que o contexto n?o  esse !!!    Ainda sobre a UNIDADE a que Jesus se referiu que os discipulos deveriam TER, assim como ELE MESMO TINHA E VIVIA EM UNIDADE COM O PAI, Paulo explicou:    Efsios  4:13   at que todos cheguemos  unidade da f e do pleno conhecimento do Filho de Deus, ao estado de homem feito,  medida da estatura da plenitude de Cristo;      Repare que nesse texto, alm de dizer que se devem todos estar unidos na MESMA F, que seria a unidade a que Jesus se referiam em Jo?o Cap. 17, o texto disse ainda que TODOS os crist?os deveriam atingir um dia a MESMA ENVERGADURA ou a MESMA ESTATURA espiritual de Jesus.

Elas possuem a mesma natureza divina, a mesma grandeza, sabedoria, poder, bondade e santidade, mas, em algumas vezes, certas atividades s?o mais reconhecidas em uma pessoa do que em outra. As fun??es, as suas principais atividades desempenhadas e o seu modo de operar est registado nas Sagradas Escrituras e claramente resumido no Credo Niceno-Constantinopolitano, o credo oficial de muitas denomina??es crist?s.    Pai  N?o foi criado nem gerado.  o princpio e o fim, princpio sem princpio da vida e est em absoluta comunh?o com o Filho e com o Esprito Santo. Foi o Pai que enviou o seu Filho, Jesus Cristo, para salvar-nos da morte espiritual, pelo sacrifcio vicrio. Isto revela o amor infinito de Deus sobre os homens e o n?o-abandono aos seus filhos adotivos. O Pai, a primeira pessoa da Trindade,  considerado como o pai eterno e perfeito.  atribudo a esta pessoa divina a cria??o do mundo.   Filho  Procede do Pai e  eternamente consubstancial (pertencente  mesma natureza e substancia) a Ele. N?o foi criado pelo Pai, mas gerado na eternidadade da substancia do Pai. Encarnou-se em Jesus de Nazar, assumindo assim a natureza humana. O Filho, a segunda pessoa da Trindade,  considerado como o Filho Eterno, com todas as perfei??es divinas: a Ele  atribuda a reden??o (salva??o) do mundo.   Esprito Santo  Procede do Pai e do Filho, sendo por estes espirado. Esta pessoa divina personaliza o Amor ntimo e infinito de Deus sobre os homens, segundo a reflex?o de Agostinho. Manifestou-se primeiramente no Baptismo e na Transfigura??o de Jesus e plenamente revelado no dia de Pentecostes. Habita nos cora??es dos fiis e estabelece entre estes e Jesus uma comunh?o ntima, tornando-os unidos num s Corpo. O Esprito Santo, a terceira pessoa da Trindade,  considerado como o puro nexo de amor. Atribui-se a esta pessoa divina a santifica??o da Igreja e do mundo com os seus dons.

Primeiro s os apstolos participaram da ceia, ou seja de toda a multid?o que seguia jesus s doze puderam participar do corpo e do sangue_isso nos mostra que somente os convertidos fielmente as boas novas podem participar. Segundo, quando Deus tirou seu povo do Egito e lhes deu o dia de comemora??o a isso que era a Pscoa. A Pscoa era comemorada no dia 14 do ms de Nis? que celebrava a alian?a de Deus com o povo, e tinha o intuito de ser lembrado entre o povo, como Deus libertou a terra de Israel ( leia xodo 12:1-28). Contudo em uma das profecias do livro de Jeremias Deus no diz que Ele n?o mais seria lembrado como o Deus que tirou o povo do Egito, mas como O Deus que resgatou Israel (Jeremias 16:14-15) De maneira que quando Jesus veio ao mundo para resgatar Israel de seus pecados ele instituiu a nova alian?a de Deus com o povo, assim a Santa Ceia entrou em lugar da Pscoa dos judeus, deste modo ela deve ser comemorada uma vez por ano no dia 14 de Nis?, que foi exatamente neste dia que Jesus celebrou a ceia com seus apstolos. O p?o deve ser asno ( xodo 12:8) como Jesus o fez (o p?o asno foi um dos poucos caracteres que Jesus usou da pscoa da Lei, alm do dia ...). Deve ser um s p?o e na frente de todos deve ser repartido, alm disso ali tambm deve ser ele aben?oado. Deve ser um s clice , com o vinho repartido entre todos, mas antes deves dar gra?as, e aps a ceia deve-se cantar um hino.(Mateus 26:17-30)            Devemos fazer tudo do modo como Jesus fez:          "Porque eu vos dei o exemplo, para que, como eu vos fiz, fa?ais vs tambm." (Jo?o 13:15)               Parece-me que nenhuma segue todos estes prncipios, exeto os testemunhas de Jeov              Realmente n?o sei porque os catlicos n?o tomam o sangue, contudo n?o desconhecem as escrituras, pois estudaram-nas, todavia negligenciam a justi?a de nosso Deus. Contudo desconhecem o poder de Deus          "Porque melhor lhes fora n?o conhecerem o caminho da justi?a, do que, conhecendo-o, desviarem-se do santo mandamento que lhes fora dado;" (2 Pedro 2:21)|`|mu7EeWWDaa	Eu tomo santa ceia|`|kEFBLJb2aa	A Igreja de Jesus Cristo dos Santos dos ltimos dias.|`|65c0760d3571c340f3da599574bd64a5aa	D um tempo...  ltimo dia do ano...um pouquinho de tolerancia faz bem...|`|tWsKLlQIaa	Amigo Carlos M,      A nica prtica, ensinada por Jesus, a  qual Doutrina Esprita segue com muito fervor  a da caridade.

Also see George W Bush this man was VOTED to be the leader of the country despite being a tool, I cannot think of the reason behind this other than his stance as a born again Christian.

They just like to think that because America was originally settled by Christians fleeing persecution by the nations in the middle ages, that its a Christian nation even though none of the Constitution as stated by the Founding Fathers and agreed upon by all founding states agreed with that, and in fact, made sure that religion had no impact on the gvt at all.    The Founding Fathers realized and understood the trouble religion had caused everyone so they created laws guaranteeing the freedom of all religion, and did not restrict it to just one.    They were smart men. The Christians just like to deny it because it doesn't suit them.    What they don't seem to get is that the nation was founded on freedom for all, it was NOT founded on freedom for only Christians. If it was founded on freedom for only Christians, them the Constitution (and all other government papers from that time) would state it.    Its called denial.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Ignorance...|`|AA11149006	what reminds me where I live is the fact that everything closes early and lots of stuff isn't open on Sunday.|`|231296b9ebdeed24570b8ca6978948c0aa	Holy See has made a point here that I've brought up several times:  Benjamin Franklin mentioning God.

Sure, Ben Franklin believed in God, but he also pointed out, "about His (Jesus') divinity, I have my doubts."      The Founding Fathers most certainly were religious and believed in God; but Christians, many were not.  It is quite possible to believe in God and not be a Christian.    Benjamin Franklin, along with Thomas Jefferson and very likely George Washington, were Deists, and were NOT Christians.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	I really don't get why people say that.

De todos modos, voy a aportar algo. Pese a tu conmovedora redaccin, los testigos de Jehov llevamos una forma de adoracin ms flexible y dinmica de lo que expones.    No nos oponemos al trasplante de tejidos, (yo fui sometido a una intervencin quirrgica y me fue aplicada una nueva tecnologa utilizando tejido vivo para suturar (cerrar) la herida, esto para reducir al mximo la prdida de sangre... fue todo un xito).    La "justicia del hombre"... en este mbito estoy muy involucrado y la "justicia del hombre" (llammosle mejor Derecho) apoya COMPLETAMENTE la decisin personal de un paciente a aceptar o rechazar CUALQUIER tipo de tratamiento mdico o teraputico. Pero si te refieres a la "sociedad humana"... prefiero mil veces obedecer a mi conciencia entrenada por la Biblia que un montn de conciencias confundidas.    Cuando mi alma muera (si esto llega a suceder) tengo FE (confianza plena basada en conocimiento) de que no voy a experimentar una mitosis espiritual y voy a ir a vagar eternamente a un mundo insubstancial.    Si vieras que me da mas miedo que un familiar NO-Testigo de Jehov se vea en la necesidad de un rgano que en el caso de un TDJ.  Salvo el temor normal y correspondiete que se experimenta en una situacin de esa naturaleza, el TDJ sentir la confianza de saberse rodeado en todo momento de un Comit de Enlace de Hospitales que se encargar de que tenga la mejor atencin posible. Se le aplicaran tcnicas pre y post-operatorias con el fin de reducir el riesgo al mnimo. Se utilizar tecnologa de punta para evitar la prdida de sangre al mximo, y de ser necesario se le aplicar sangre artificial y expandidores del volmen (no sanguneos).    He visto muchos casos degente de otras religiones (curiosamente los ateos y agnsticos, emulan a los TDJ en los hospitales) que han fallecido debido a complicaciones en un procedimiento medico 'simple'. Y he visto a hermanos mios TDJ sobrevivir operaciones de alto riesgo y complejidad, de una manera que los mdicos han calificado simplemente de "milagrosa".    Finalmente dejar clara mi postura con palabras de Josu, "Ahora, si es malo a sus ojos servir a Jehov, escjanse hoy a quin quieren servir... pero en cuanto a m y a mi casa, nosotros serviremos a Jehov.

mRG7FqRnaa	Como debo responder partiendo de una suposicin, entonces creo que ya la opinin es subjetiva y depende ms de aquello que me ha tocado vivir.    Me atrevi a calificar de mala la respuesta de celene, pues concluye diciendo que si no es por la gente de arriba nosotros no podemos hacer nada aqui abajo.    Primero que nada me gustara saber si el origen de la maldad en una persona que roba ?es producto de la fuga de su realidad?. Es decir con la narracin que haces donde hablas de falta de cari?o, de abrigo, de techo, de apoyo, de una infancia perdida por culpa de la ausencia de alguien en quien guiarse, y es ese alguien quien te asalta para consumir despues con ese dinero drogas. Pues creo que es obvio que la persona quiera estar ausente de su realidad, que no desee saber nada de un mundo que lo maltrata desde su nacimiento y que mientras mas tiempo se encuentre ausente de l mejor ser para l, pero al terminarse el efecto de su fuga regrese a una realidad donde delinquir para seguir fuera de.    Pero son fenomenos tan complejos como lo es cada caso en particular.     Si analizamos una por una a las personas que son victimas y victimarios, podriamos esperar quiza este mismo escenario, uno que ataca y otro que defiende.    Por eso es menester para mejorar la convivencia y las oportunidades que se emprendan programas de apoyo para igualar las oportunidades de quien nace en desventaja del futuro abogado o de la futura dise?adora.     Pero vuelvo a un principio y creo que la Educacin es la solucin. Aun en carencia de oportunidades no me incluyo entre quienes desarrollan ese sentimiento de ayuda al projimo, pero si los hay, para quienes somos concientes debera ser una obligacin ayudar a quienes dedican su tiempo y su vida a ayudar a salir adelante a los que menos tienen.|`|KjBAJVTbaa	es obvio que si, si no conoces otra realidad, seguro que caes en eso.     es un buen punto el tuyo, pero hay gente que se sintio iluminada y pudo salir.       yo estuve un tiempo viviendo en una villa a proposito, y te puedo asegurar que muchos de los que son pobres e ignorantes, tienen television, dvd, audio, etc.    y asi como tienen tele, pueden ver como se maneja la sociedad, por ese medio pueden ver que es lo que esta bien y lo que esta mal.    aunque no lo creas, todos en la villa tienen una tele, aunque sea en blanco y ***** y tienen acceso a informacion.  no hay excusa, pero si tomamos de ejemplo el entorno, siempre estaran presionados por los mas fuertes y caen facil en la droga y la delincuencia. no tienen salida.|`|jiZ6hTieaa	lo mas injusto que hay es decir: hay igualdad de derechos y no hacer nadaa ni por un solo chico de esos...  en fin..coherencia..no digamos nada y hagamos un trueque a alguno de ellos..  calle por empleo..  bolsita por...idea de otra forma de vida..  lugar donde quedarse hasta lograr su recuperacion..sentiendose util y querido..mas un poco respetado como persona..  a veces los perros...tienen peluqueros..???que verguenza!!!|`|XX4glaYSaa	Hola Leona,  Yo tena un profesor de antropologa q siempre deca que eso de "Ser o no ser, solo depende de vos" es una gran  MENTIRA.

Claro esta que para que eso sea as la persona tiene que querer salir a delante con esfuerzo y constancia.  Comprendo que ay gente que les cueste ms salir a delante que a otros, y quien le resulte mas atractivo estar todo el da colocado y la libertad la vean en las calles haciendo lo que quieren.

eAcvRJl3aa	animo, a veces la vida nos manda pruebas muy fuertes que son dificiles de superar, tantos problemas que creemos que el mundo se nos acaba, pero no es asi, no son mas que obstaculos para ser mejores personas, tal vez has perdido algunas cosas que realmente no te hacian bien, y otras tantas que te hacian bien, pero a lo mejor no eran lo mejor para ti. yo se que te has de estar sintiendo horrible, pero trata de salir adelante para que todo vaya saliendo mas bien.  lo que si, es que eres muy afortunado y tienes casi todo a comparacion de otras personas: tienes dos pies para caminar, tienes dos manos para tomar las cosas y trabajar, tienes dos ojos para ver, tienes una boca para comer y para hablar, tienes dos oidos con que escuchar, tienes tanto a comparacion de otros que ahorita estan en coma, o sin alguna parte de su cuerpo, o son sordomudos, etc.  animate..saludos|`|WOPvCNDLaa	Los problemas que pasan en tu vida no son culpa de Dios.   Al permitir Dios el libre albedrio en el mundo, el hombre con su pecado trajo problemas y dificultades al mundo.     Si en verdad crees en Dios debes entender que pese a los problemas y las injusticias el te ama, tal cual eres.   Debes reconocerte debil, necesitado de El, y que el es capaz de ayudarte.    Yo tambien tengo problemas me he peleado con mi mujer que no quiere casarse conmigo por religioso, no me llevo muy bien con las personas, tambien tengo problemas con el resto de mi familia, tengo una enfermedad no muy grave pero que requiere muchos sacrificios para curarla, tengo un corte en mi mano derecha que no me permite mover bien un dedo y tampoco tengo un trabajo fijo.    La diferencia esta en que yo creo en Dios, y confio en que el me va a ayudar, por que el permite que me pasen esos problemas para que mejore y me acerque mas al el.    Dios es sabio, no te va mandar una prueba que no puedas superar. porque en verdad te ama. Aunque ayudaria si en verdad dejas de preocuparte y confias en que El te va a ayudar.|`|SOXPgxIBaa	Y porque pensas que es el que te saca las cosas?   Hay algo que nos dio el que se llama "Libre albedrio", y es justamente la capacidad de elegir, estamos eligiendo constantemente en la vida. Nosotros somos los artifices de nuestro propio destino.   Yo antes me preguntaba siempre que me pasaba algo ?Porque me pasa esto a mi?, hasta que entendi, que hay cosas que no tienen respuestas y no es que Dios, nos deje solos, sino que es necesario para nuestras vidas, tener que pasar ciertas cosas o necesidades y siempre me acostumbre a mirar atras y darme cuenta que hay gente que esta mucho peor, que siempre va a haber alguien que le falta algo mas. Y como el ser humano es debil, es logico que tengamos esa reaccion, pero despues que veas las cosas mas a la distancia, vas a entender que todo pasa por algun proposito que no tiene que ver con Dios, sino con alguna necesidad tuya o a veces alguna actitud que debes cambiar. Lamentablemente a veces la vida nos toca duro para que reaacionemos y una vez que reaacionamos decimos, no era necesario esto, pero es que antes no lo veiamos.  Dios va a estar protegiendote siempre, le hables o no, siempre va a estar dispuesto a perdonar y a dar una nueva oportunidad. Pero nosotros tenemos que saber que tenemos que aprender a vivir sin reproches. No te olvides que estamos en esta vida para aprender lecciones y poder a traves de los errores corregirnos hasta llegar a Dios.|`|M3V39s13aa	DIOS NO TE ESTA QUITANDO NADA Y LOS PROBLEMAS SON NADA MAS QUE TUS CIRCUNSTANCIAS Y NO DURARAN SIEMPRE|`|e97aaa713f98e3eaf9bd0be45f770f04aa	Si perdiste todo eso es muy simple... el sr. quiere guerreros...y gente que salga adelante... deja todo y sigueme... es claro el mensaje..... o eres muy tonto  y no sabes retener las cosas contigo... sal de tu depresion y trata de ser feliz.|`|08uCoMZjaa	Dios no tiene culpa de tus decisiones........quizas con estas experiencias aprendas a tomar mejores deciciones......La vida no es facil amigo...........a Cristo lo mataron en la cruz,pero antes lo azotaron, le escupieron y le dieron antas casi quitarle la vida......despues lo mataron ......El pecado no es facil........pero Dios nos ha prometido algo mejor.........enfocate y comienza a luchar por lo que quieres..........con la ayuda del que vecio la muerte y resucito.......................El te comprende ...nosotros no|`|e707b6e6868b20d91aad07ab30ff8d06aa	Epa  Jernimo, que te pasa , tu las pierdes , no te las quita Dios, o acaso , tienes en cuenta a Dios en tu vida diaria , vives como el te lo pide en las Sagradas Escrituras, ?Que le das a Dios, para reprocharle los resultados negativos que te suceden?, es muy fcil buscar en otros la responsabilidad , cuando quizs , no se tu caso, el resultado sea producto de malas desiciones- Se cosecha lo que se siembra - por lo general - Santiago 1 : 13 dice "Al estar bajo prueba que nadie diga Dios me somete a prueba.Porque con cosas malas Dios no puede ser sometido a prueba , ni somete a prueba el mismo a nadie" Adquiere el conocimiento de Dios, EJERCE la fe y ya no pensars igual y lo que es mas , te ir bien, logrars la salvacin  y con ella la vida eterna.nimo.|`|1sOkZC2oaa	Jernimo: tu nica culpa, es creer que existe un ser superior que te va a arreglar la vida.

Yo se y comprendo, porque lo he pasado, que cuando uno est sumergido en un problema,  nadie lo puede percibir con la intensidad de la persona con problemas, pero.hay un GRAN PERO a esta situacin y es que t puedes cortarla cambiando tus pensamientos sobre lo que te est ocurriendo. te PUEDO DECIR QUE ES FCIL, PERO NO LO ES. pero QUIZS S, SI TU SIENTES INTERNAMENTE QUE TIENES UNA FUERZA QUE PUEDE OPONERse A TODO LO QUE EST SUCEDIENDO. esa FUERZA ES Dios, DE QUIEN T ESTS DESPOTRICANDO, DICINDOLO QUE TE ESTA QUITANDO TODO LO QUE T QUIERES. amigo, NO TE ENOJES CONMIGO POR LO QUE TE ESTOY DICIENDO Y TRATA, AUNQUE SEA POR UN MOMENTITO  DE COMPRENDER LO SIGUIENTE: ESTS SEGURO DE QUE Dios TE EST QUITANDO LO QUE T MAS QUIERES? no SER QUE INCONSCIENTEMENTE T LO HAS DESEADO CON PENSAMIENTOS COMO :estoy aburrido de esta casa, mi mujer me tiene harto, el trabajo ese cada da mas malo y no puedo ni pagar la casa. No te conozco pero algunos , o todos estos  pensamientos los debes haber tenido o incluso, hablado. Como puedes pretender salir de tu aflictiva situacin si no pones de tu esfuerzo? Anigo : DEBES TRATAR,: Dios no le desea el mal a nadie ni le quita nada a nadie. Para qu hara eso? Por tu forma de pensar, supongo que perteneces a una de esas religiones que te meten miedo con el castigo de Dios si no haces esto o o lo otro, o si haces lo otro o sto.  Librate amigo y mira y piensa en Dios como un Ser que solo desea lo mejor para t, que EL NUNCA te castigar ni a t ni a nadie, porque es puro amor, compasin y todo lo bueno en grado mximo. Me sentira feliz si he logrado hacerte ver una peque?a lucesit de esperanza, la cual tu puedes agrandar a voluntad hasta que esa luz de esperanza se transforme en fe.

Actitudes que llevarn a cabo siempre que vean dentro de su territorio -o acosando a alguna de sus hembras- a otro macho rival.       En un gallinero, espacio por lo general de reducidas dimensiones, cualquier gallo nada ms despertar se ve en la obligacin de demostrar a todo el corral que sigue siendo el macho dominante-, y si el silencio no contesta al desafiante cntico, vendr una pelea, fontica en primer lugar y fsica a continuacin, con los gallos aspirantes al puesto de honor.

En realidad canta a cualquier hora del da, y repetidas veces. Lo que ocurre es que se oye con ms fuerza y claridad en el silencio del amanecer.    Los gallos son aves territoriales que muestran su podero mediante el pavoneo, la coloracin e hinchazn de su cresta y los desafiantes cantos. As, nada ms despertarse con los primeros rayos del Sol, siente la necesidad de demostrar su condicin de macho dominante a todo el gallinero.

Por ello no es frecuente encontrar varios gallos en un mismo gallinero, pues rivalizaran y se pelearan entre ellos. A no ser que haya suficientes gallinas para repartir y los animales se sientan satisfechos con su dominios.      Nota sabionda: En la iconografa cristiana el gallo cantando representa la resurreccin de Cristo y es uno de los elementos que acompa?an a las representaciones de San Pedro. El papa Nicols I ordeno la colocacin de la figura de un gallo en la parte ms alta de los templos para simbolizar las tres negaciones que San Pedro hizo de Jess tras la ltima Cena.

Esto no es del todo cierto pues, si bien es en esos momentos cuando entonan su cacareo, esta conducta se produce por el hbito sexual de la especie, y no debido exclusivamente al resurgir del astro rey.     De hecho este canto es repetido a otras horas a lo largo del da, aunque es por la ma?ana cuando lo hacen con ms intensidad, ya que entre los gallos existe un alto grado de jerarqua y debe de ser el macho dominante el que realice este alarde el primero y con mayor fuerza.     |`|jiZ6hTieaa	porque duermen con los ojos abiertos..aaahjajaj  no..si tienen parpados..  debe ser..porque el amanecer es hermoso pero no canta, y el gallo s para despertar a los dems animales de la granja..entre ellos al marido ..jeee.|`|65abed56d50dda35b1fd7c588b03434caa	La mayora de los gallos cantan porque presienten que el nuevo da esta por presentarse que para ellos significa trabajo y proteccin a  sus embras y cra, en este caso sus gallinas y pollitos respectivamente.|`|AA12344285	Es por una cuestin de territorios, al cantar ellos dicen "Ac estoy yo, este lugar est ocupado".

ZF7Gu2kEaa	Les femmes ont des capacits pas infrieures mais lgrement diffrentes...    Il semblerait qu'elles soient mieux adaptes  certains mtiers que les hommes et rciproquement.

Le probleme cest que les femmes portent leurs enfants pendant environ 9 mois dans leur ventre et du coup l'enfant n forcment avec l'handicape d'avoir une partie de son cerveau qui ressemble a sa mre. cest pire quand cest une fille.|`|4b6b23bf337d9e8f6d3e5fcb502f33cfaa	Moins intelligentes ?

893D2NDYaa	En France, a-t-on le droit de manifester pour que les gens se mettent  pratiquer une religion ?  Oui, on peut manifester aprs avoir eu l'autorisation. Mais bon, demander le droit de manifester afin de "faire du proslytisme", c'est pas trs malin. Par contre, on va pas te mettre en prison si tu distribues la Bible ou le Coran, par exemple ou si tu prches la bonne parole. Notons que mme les sectes en ont le droit !      En fait, @propaganja, tu fais une confusion que pas mal de musulmans font (comme le fait @oiseau bleu). Tu as totalement le droit de porter des signes "ostentatoire" de religion dans la rue. D'ailleurs, en France on interdit pas les femmes de se promener voile ou mme burkanise.  La la?cit n'est pas d'interdire la religion ou de la cacher. La la?cit est que l'tat soit neutre, qu'elle n'est pas de religion ou qu'elle n'en favorise pas l'une par rapport  une autre.  Dans les coles, on ne doit donc favoris aucune religion. Et la rgle veut que tout le monde enlve leur couvre-chef. Mais des musulmanes ne voulaient pas le faire au nom de leur religion. Il tait impensable que certains musulmans aient une drogation spciale pour le voile. Sans compter que le voile est un sujet qui fait dbat mme au sein des musulmans, alors ce n'est certainement pas  la France d'y trancher.  En dehors de l'cole publique (jusqu'au lyce, et donc jusqu' environ 18ans), tu mets ce que tu veux sur ta tte: un voile, un chapeau, un sac poubelle,...Mais  l'intrieur, tu n'as pas  avoir des rgles spciales pour toi sous prtexte que tu sois musulmans ou autre.    En thorie, on peut l'interdire dans une mairie. Et une mosque a le droit de lancer un appel  la prire.      Petit message  @oiseau bleu :  Le Hidjab est autoris en France. Et rappelons que le hidjab est un habit dict par les hommes pour oppresser les femmes en leur faisant croire qu'il vient de Dieu et que c'est bien pour elle.  :D|`|h0dqAoL9aa	Manifester pour pratiquer une religion au nom de la la?cit ... t'as tout compris, mon pauvre ami !!|`|7a8395c94c2cac06e3f97f6c000d6273aa	http://veille-education.org/post/2008/07...|`|b71oZkGgaa	Est-ce qu'il y aura une contre-manifestation ?

Por ejemplo, a los 24 yo ya me vea como alguien que viva independientemente, titulado de su carrera y trabajando en lo que a mi me gusta, y hablando de la carrera, pues me imaginaba que estara estudiando lejos de casa y pues viviendo ya un poco de manera independiente.    Y pues la realidad es: que actualmente vivo en un lugar un poquito lejos de mi casa, pero mis paps practicamente viven conmigo y me siguen sobreprotegiendo un poco. De la carrera todava me falta a?o y medio para terminarla. Esto es porque cuando iba en primaria me atras dos a?os y no porque fuera mal estudiante sino porque en mi familia nos mudabamos mucho de casa (y de estado) as que en cada cambio perd un a?o escolar. Y pues todava falta ver si consigo trabajo cuando egrese de mi carrera.    Tambin debo admitir que me vea como alguien sino guapo pero si no feo. Je, y pues la verdad tengo unos kilitos de ms que definitivamente no me gustan (bueno, me pregunto a quien le gustar), debido a mis nervios me he causado da?o yo solo, por ejemplo la cara la tengo con algunas marcas de espinillas, adems tena la costumbre (y a veces todava me pasa) de cuando me enojaba morderme la parte inferior del labio y pues ya lo tengo un poco hinchado.

Ser que ?    Naturalmente, fala-se muito na poca do Natal sobre paz na terra, e boa vontade para com os homens, mas a realidade  que as contendas e as discuss?es familiares se tornam comuns nessa fase do ano. O jornal Sunday Oregonian, dos?EUA, veicula que, antes do Natal, alguns pais e parentes est?o instigando brigas que tornar?o a Noite de Natal um dos piores turnos do ano para os policiais. Explica um vice-delegado: Os parentes se renem e bebem, e come?am a discutir problemas passados que tiveram, e ent?o come?am a desenterrar hostilidades que j tinham sido sepultadas e deveriam permanecer sepultadas. E, entre as famlias de baixa renda, o estresse de prover um bom Natal para os filhos aumenta as tens?es, e come?am a ferver os maus gnios, afirma o Oregonian. s vezes, o Natal num lar pode ser destrudo numa briga conjugal, os pacotes sendo usados como projteis e a rvore do Natal ficando reduzida a destro?os.    Com respeito  paz numa escala global, conta-se, amide com olhos embaciados, uma histria sobre a Noite do Natal de 1914, quando uma sentinela inglesa ouviu o som de vozes que entoavam Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht das trincheiras alem?s, a cerca de 90 metros de distancia. As tropas inglesas cantaram, em resposta: Vinde, Todos Vs, Fiis. Da, ambos os lados abandonaram suas trincheiras para entoar juntos vrias can??es natalinas por algumas horas. Mas, rapidamente voltaram depois  matan?a, sendo todos supostos crist?os! Ser que este evento revela qualquer esprito do Natal verdadeiramente pacfico?

El ser humano an no se ha podido explicar muchas cosas (no quiere decir que nunca logren explicarse) como ?porqu estamos aqu? ?cmo surgi el universo?, etc. y encuentran una explicacin "fcil" en la idea de un ser todopoderoso.

Algunos le colocan nombres y dicen hablar con l.    En primer trmino la Bblia no se?ala un angel personal o particular, lo que dice es:    salm  34:7  El ngel de Jehov acampa alrededor de los que le temen,    Y los defiende.    Los ngeles son incorpreos, es decir no tienen figura humana por su naturaleza espiritual, aunque algunas veces toman "apariencia" de seres humanos.    Tampoco se les puede hablar, rezar  ni pedir nada, porque ellos reciben rdenes directa de Dios salvo que traigan un "mensaje" ( de ah su nombre) para una persona o comunidad.    LOS NGELES EXISTEN, SON REALES,TIENEN SU PROPIA PERSONALIDAD, NO SON VISIBLES POR NO TENER CONFIGURACIN HUMANA, A VECES ADOPTAN APARICIONES COMO VARONES DE LUZ.PARA SER VISTO POR LOS HUMANOS.  Los ngeles son espritus ministradores al servicio de Dios hacia los hombres, no de los hombres a Dios.  Tienen inteligencia, poder y estn al servicio de Dios y son mensajeros a los hombres, cuando Dios quiere revelar una verdad.  A LOS NGELES NO SE LES DEBE PEDIR, LLAMAR O INVOCAR. ELLOS NO RESPONDEN AL LLAMADO HUMANO, PERO A VECES LOS DEMONIOS SE HACEN PASAR POR ANGELES.   2CO 11:14  Y NO ES MARAVILLA, PORQUE EL MISMO SATANS SE DISFRAZA COMO NGEL DE LUZ.  Hay que tener mucho cuidado con eso de invocar o llamar a ngeles porque muchas veces los espritus malos enga?an a las personas.  En estos casos es mejor invocar el nombre de Jess.  .  Heb 1:7 Ciertamente de los ngeles dice: El que hace a sus ngeles espritus, Y a sus ministros llama de fuego.  . 2Pe 2:11 mientras que los ngeles, que son mayores en fuerza y en potencia, no pronuncian juicio de maldicin contra ellas delante del Se?or.  No se deben invocar ni arrodillarse delante de ellos ni pedirles nada.  Apoc 19:9 Y el ngel me dijo: Escribe: Bienaventurados los que son llamados a la cena de las bodas del Cordero. Y me dijo: Estas son palabras verdaderas de Dios.  Apoc. 19:10 Yo me postr a sus pies para adorarle.

Clases de ngeles: ngeles, arcngeles, querubines y serafines.    No son aliens, pues estos no existen.    No hay angelitas,  porque los ngeles no tienen sexo, por consiguiente no se pueden reproducir tampoco, ni pueden tener sexo con los humanos.      |`|UAV1iDIqaa	tiene las alas rotas, pero consigue bolar, su rostro es parecido al de una cabra ensangrentada con largos cuernos, en su delgado y costilludo pecho tiene una cicatriz con forma de  estrella de 5 puntas en un circulo rojo. en una mano sostiene un faro que opaca toda luz que lo rodee y en la otra una AK-47. si ve a tu angel terminara destrozandole sus emplumadas y bellas alas dejandolo indefenzo para despues deborarlo    lo olvidaba... si es mujer tu angel, primero la viola despues se la come    --------------------------------------...|`|6T7rWkrFaa	Segn la Biblia, los ngeles son espritus, tal como Dios es un Espritu (Salmo 104:4; Juan 4:24). Forman una gran familia compuesta de millones de miembros, todos los cuales son poderosos en potencia (Salmo 103:20; Revelacin [Apocalipsis] 5:11). Aunque son semejantes al hombre en el sentido de que estn dotados de personalidad y libre albedro, no?existieron primero como seres humanos. De?hecho, Dios los cre mucho antes que al hombre, incluso antes de formar el planeta Tierra. Cuando Dios fund[] la tierra, se?ala la Biblia, las estrellas de la ma?ana [es decir, los ngeles] gozosamente clamaron a una, y todos los hijos de Dios empezaron a gritar en aplauso (Job 38:4,?7). Dado que son creacin de Dios, se les llama hijos de Dios.  ?Nos protegen los ngeles en la actualidad? Si adoramos a Jehov tal como lo indica su Palabra, se nos garantiza que sus poderosos ngeles invisibles nos protegern. La?Biblia asegura: El ngel de Jehov est acampando todo en derredor de los que le temen, y los libra (Salmo 34:7).    Sin embargo, hemos de reconocer que los ngeles estn primordialmente al servicio de Dios y no?de los seres humanos (Salmo 103:20,?21). Obedecen las rdenes de Dios, no?las peticiones de los hombres; de ah que no?debamos pedir ayuda a los ngeles, sino a Jehov Dios (Mateo 26:53). Claro est, dado que los ngeles son invisibles a nuestros ojos, no?podemos decir hasta qu punto Dios los utiliza para ayudar a la gente. No?obstante, sabemos que Jehov desea mostrar su fuerza a favor de aquellos cuyo corazn es completo para con l (2?Crnicas 16:9; Salmo 91:11). Tenemos la seguridad de que no importa qu sea lo que pidamos conforme a su voluntad, [Dios] nos oye (1?Juan 5:14).    Las Escrituras tambin nos dicen que nuestras oraciones y adoracin deben dirigirse solo a Dios (xodo 20:3-5; Salmo 5:1,?2; Mateo 6:9). Los ngeles fieles nos animan a hacerlo as. Por ejemplo, cuando el apstol Juan quiso adorar a uno de ellos, este lo reprendi, diciendo: ?Ten cuidado! ?No hagas eso!?[...] Adora a Dios (Revelacin 19:10).|`|MEJGqf2Uaa	ni idea... ojala siempre me este acompa?ando sobre todo por que ma?ana tengo que hacer un examen de admision de la universidad y de mi puntaje depende si entro a una carrera... chao!!|`|tYcZ6zriaa	para mi no existen|`|MpaTS1F8aa	esas malditas drogas, como hacen da?o !!!!!!|`|ebh0wotsaa	LOS NGELES NO EXISTEN |`|kH3KxWYMaa	EL DEL  FECAL  ,BORRACHO , ENANO, MESINICO, TRAIDOR  Y VENDE  PATRIAS, ACOMPLEJADO Y RATA ADEMS  DE  MUCHISIMOS  ANTIVALORES QUE  TIENE.|`|u4zWbVFKaa	yo me imagino una angela. rubia de ojos verdes, cuerpo de vedette, simpatica, de rasgos perfectos. me la imagino esperandome en el cielo para que le de matraca toda la eternidad.    pero es una fantasia, nada mas|`|H1l8zaZGaa	hay ps yo me imagino a mi angel mujer con pelo amarillo largo hasta la cintura ojos azules y con unas alas bellas de plumas blancas con una ammmm como se llama tunica blanca con toques dorados qe siempre tiene una palabra de consuelo en su vocabulario y esta ahi para cuidarme bueno eso es todo adios |`|1pOKxm7baa	Dicen que los angeles son asexuados pero para mi el mo es ms ni?o que ni?a, se llama LAU y una vez le pregunte que como quera llamarse por que pues en verdad que es maravilloso conmigo.    y de pronto empece a ver... abarrotes Laura, peluquera laura... en el radio se escucho ese nombre tambin y asi... entonces como no tiene sexo es lau a secas...

Crees que siendo brutal con tus palabras haras entender la equivocacin de las personas. No aportas nada insultando. No ayudas a nadie criticando. Puedes ir y regresar y nadie se dar cuenta. Si no respetas a los dems no esperes lo mismo. Si quieres ayudar responde con objetividad, no insultando y palabreando sin argumentos validos. A nadie le importa lo que a ti te paso, importa que de ello hayas aprendido y si ves que alguien est pasando por lo mismo lo orientes a salir adelante. Hablas de paises tercermundistas, como si tu vivieras en uno que no lo es. Ubicate, cambia de actitud. No me interesa atacarte, tu solo te encargas de ello. Solo te digo que a mi parecer, no solo no aportas nada, sino que haces de este un lugar de asco queriendote imponer con discursos llenos de coraje y de furia, muy lejos de ser lo que tanto pregonas.

Si decimos que Dios revel religin distinta a Moiss y otra  diferente a Jess, y otra totalmente diferente a Mohammed  eso quiere decir que nuestro Dios es un Dios contradictorio, y claro que no lo es ?Glorificado sea!   Por eso nosotros los musulmanes creemos en todos los mensajeros y profetas de Dios, sin hacer ninguna distincin entre ninguno de ellos ya que todos recibieron  el mismo mensaje que es la adoracin a un solo Dios y evitar la adoracin directa o indirecta a su  creacin, Por eso decimos que Moiss y Jess ( que la paz sea con ellos) eran musulmanes tambin porque la palabra Islam en rabe significa  la sumisin total ante la voluntad de Dios  por lo tanto, ser musulmn significa ser sumiso a un solo Dios o  adorar a un solo Dios, y por eso creemos en la Tora y en la Biblia , tambin ya que llevaban el mismo mensaje y proceden de la misma fuente que es Dios (pero la Biblia fue alterada varias veces.. y si no lo fuera..?porqu existen varias versiones diferentes? ?Quizs hubiera muchos Jess?).   "Y por cierto que a todos los Mensajeros que envi antes de ti [?Oh, Muhammad!] les revel que no existe ms divinidad que Yo, [y les orden:] ?Adoradme slo a M!. (Sura 21:25).  Jess mismo asegura y corrobora lo mismo, y tambin la Biblia:  17 No piensen que vine para abolir la Ley o los Profetas: yo no he venido a abolir, sino a dar cumplimiento. (Mateo. 5)    Este concepto de unicidad  de Dios que pregonado por Moiss (que la paz sea con l) en el pasaje bblico conocido como Chema o el credo de fe de los judos Escucha, OH Israel El se?or nuestro Dios es un solo Se?or (Deuteronomio 6.4)   -          Este credo fue repetido por palabra 1,500 a?os ms tarde por Jess ( la paz sea con l) que lo dice muy claro aqu:  28 Un escriba que los oy discutir, al ver que les haba respondido bien, se acerc y le pregunt: "?Cul es el primero de los mandamientos?".     29 Jess respondi: "El primero es: Escucha, Israel: el Se?or nuestro Dios es el nico Se?or; 30 y t amars al Se?or, tu Dios, con todo tu corazn y con toda tu alma, con todo tu espritu y con todas tus fuerzas.    31 El segundo es: Amars a tu prjimo como a ti mismo. No hay otro mandamiento ms grande que estos".    32 El escriba le dijo: "Muy bien, Maestro, tienes razn al decir que hay un solo Dios y no hay otro ms que l, 33 y que amarlo con todo el corazn, con toda la inteligencia y con todas las fuerzas, y amar al prjimo como a s mismo, vale ms que todos los holocaustos y todos los sacrificios. (Marcos.12)  -          Mohammed (Paz y bendiciones de Allah sean con l) vino aproximadamente 600 a?os despus de Jess trayendo otra vez el mismo mensaje  Vuestro Dios es un solo Dios, no hay otra divinidad sino l) (Corn 2:163)  Si eres lgico lee este debate y contempla muy bien en l:  Un da el ex rey de Egipto invit a 3 personas a un debate: judo, cristiano y musulmn y les pidi que cada uno demostrara que su pueblo es l quien  entrara al paraso.  El gestor del debate pidi al judo que empezara primero pero l rechazo y pas la palabra al sacerdote pero l tampoco quiso empezar primero y la pas despus al musulmn.   El musulmn dijo: Si los judos entraran el paraso, entraramos tambin porque creemos en Moiss.  Y si los cristianos entraran al paraso entraramos igual porque creemos en Jess.   Y si nosotros los musulmanes seamos los que entramos  y lo entraremos si Dios quiere, entonces no entrarn ni los judos, ni los cristianos hasta que ellos crean en Mohammed.    ???Un debate se acab solo por tres frases!!!     Di: creemos en Allah y en los que nos ha revelado, en lo que fue revelado a Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Jacob y a las doce tribus, y en lo que Moiss, Jess y los profetas han recibido de su Se?or, no hacemos distincin entre ninguno de ellos y nos sometemos a l, quien siga una religin diferente al Islam ( el sometimiento a Allah) no se le aceptar, y en la otra vida se contar entre los perdedores (Corn 2: 84,85 )  Y eso es lo ms bonito en el islam no tenemos nada que perder o que temer ya que creemos en todos los profetas de Dios. Y adems, nuestra religin incluye a todas. Por lo tanto, el paraso esta garantizado.  |`|5b41c4341ac5eda3b68d38a212585988aa	mentira|`|uKwUDo1raa	  inexistente.|`|EiykBMHIaa	Conocida frase, pero no por eso deja de ser verdad o cuando menos mi verdad: Dios es amor.|`|VCCprKVoaa	Dios es Amor.|`|TqzH517daa	aleluya|`|fIeTy89aaa	imaginario =)|`|K6RCO5W6aa	Amor.

La PASIN es un sentimiento de deseo que se siente hacia otra persona, ya sea deseo de cuerpo a cuerpo o ya sea psicolgicamente.  La OBSESIN es una "enfermedad" que sufre alguna personas cuando se centra en una sola idea y siempre la tiene en la cabeza.|`|SKwYit2maa	El amor es todo aquello que despierta un sentimiento. amor a algo o a alguien, es un sentimiento muy bonito que se siente en el corazon.     Pasion es algo que se desea, que despierta interes por descubir u obtener.     Obsesion, es un sentimiento enfermiso. es algo que la persona desea tener en contra de la voluntad de otros u obligar a alguien a que lo acepte. La persona que tiene sentimientos de obsesion deberia de recibir atencion medica inmediatamente, por que puede llegar a comer sucuicido o volver locos a los demas. |`|iHMA0se8aa	amor es un sentimiento puro que un ser humano  siente por otro , tenemos el amor de madre,  que se dice que es  un abismo sin medida ,  el amor filial el que se siente por un amigo , y el amor  carnal el que se siente por la pareja o con aquella persona que queremos compartir la vida. La pasin es un sentimiento  a veces  pasajero que  nos induce a querer  tener a una persona con nosotros  solo por satisfaccin personal no comprometiendo nuestros sentimientos ms profundos . y la obsesin   como la palabra lo indica queremos tener a esa persona a toda costa  ya sea porque no es fcil  o porque  en realidad no nos d ni pelotas  o simplemente nos ha dicho que no le gustamos  y  llega a nosotros una rebelda  y  queremos salir  a toda costa  con nuestra idea adelante y nos decimos  Ser lo que yo quiero  auque ella diga lo contrario esa es una  OBSESIN . |`|QjZfdLqyaa	AMOR: Fuerte afecto hacia otro, sentimiento intenso de atraccin, vinculacin afectiva propensa al sacrificio. En su funcin social de simpata, el amor fomenta el espritu de solidaridad, y existen tantas formas de afecto como sus correspondientes de superioridad, subordinacin y proximidad.    PASIN: Impulso afectivo indomable por la razn. Afecto intenso, deseo vehemente ( pasin del juego). Entusiasmo. La psicologa moderna utiliza en su lugar los trminos emocin y pulsin.    OBSESIN: Preocupacin intelectual o afectiva que acosa a la conciencia. Puede ser un pensamiento obsceno o un problema absurdo; a veces, es el temor a realizar un acto odioso o criminal. El sujeto padece con su obsesin, y se agota luchando contra ella. Pueden aparecer pensamientos obsesivos en sujetos normales, despus de una gran   fatiga.

8qjEZRIxaa	Estoy de acuerdo con el cruzado en ambas cosas, me desagrada mucho los homosexuales superficiales que toman su forma de vida como un juego y la usan para levantarse su propio (y degradante) ego, yo soy homosxual pero no ando por la vida gritandolo y sintiendome orgulloso de serlo, no digo que me de pena o que sea un reprimido simplemente que soy lo que soy y punto no tengo por que alardear de algo que yo considero que es muy comun, es como si los heteros de pronto decidieran hacer sus marchas heteros y sentirse orgullosos de serlo, digo es simplemente los gustos sexuales de los humanos, es por eso que opino que la homosexualidad es solo un gusto y preferencia mas de un mundo cada vez mas complejo jejejeje, no hay que rompernos la cabeza intentando descifrarla, saludotes :)|`|ZeeQkiuQaa	que son anormales, desde el punto de vista natural  es como si alguien decidiera comer con el ano :S  ojo no soy religioso, ni tampoco digo que sean mejores o peores personas|`|Rde0X7jbaa	Yo me considero bisexual pero , confieso que da  un poco de miedo las relaciones formales|`|ySr4rEk9aa	 bien por ellos no crees??|`|d5347046c74701265f6b862515ddbe08aa	Yo opino que no existe persona genuina ya que todos estamos sujetos a nuestro medio de vida, me refiero mas que todo a la familia, escuela y sociedad, eso sin importar nuestra orientacin sexual.|`|XYBamrgfaa	mira los homosexuales y lesbianas antes era complicado ver a uno solo sin ser madreado, pero ahora yo tengo amigos que son homosexuales y amigas que son lesbianas, tengo mi pareja y salimos con ellos al cine al baile, no se le salen sus sentimientos a  relucir pero siempre estan juntos, respeto eso, por que uno no es nadie para juzgar.

UwBxMW63aa	In Oz, Charity organisations, Football clubs, Returned servicemen's clubs, etc, all have some sort of tax free status.    I think churches must have additional advantages cos I know Oz is one of the few places that Scientology is 'recognised' as a church.    Now, if Scientology can get the tax breaks I reckon any other organisation should too.  Of course Buddhism is recognised in most places - they don't do InvisibleSkyChappies - there must be a way.    I know Richard Dawkins has registered two Foundations* running in synch.   One in US and one in UK.    Go on to his website and have a browse.  The company is more upmarket in general.

Esto se aplica especialmente a Alemania durante el comienzo del siglo XIX, cuando los judos de Galicia y Polonia aprovecharon cada oportunidad para ir hacia el oeste. Arturo Ruppin, escribiendo a fines del siglo XIX, cuando medidas drsticas fueron tomadas para evitar que los judos rusos se asentaran en Alemania, demostr que el crecimiento de la poblacin juda en Alemania haba cesado casi enteramente, debido a la cada del ndice de natalidad y, posiblemente, a la emigracin.|`|jiZ6hTieaa	debo decirte mi querido amigo Alberto que esta pregunta ya la respond tres veces..y vers que no en igual manera..o sea soy mltiple  porque le dijeron: vengan y vern ac la Vida es Bella.  fueron y cayeron en el gas.  es terrible que se hayan credo superiores, (ahora pasa con el pas americano...y humm)
4nGMA6hkaa	Samuel Gonzlez Quiroz,mejor conocido como El Changolen (1941) es una celebridad mexicana, famoso por su participacin dentro del popular programa de Toma Libre e Incgnito. Su nombre real es Samuel Gonzlez Quiroz, como l lo menciono en un episodio.    Vida y Carrera     Changolen entrevistando a una joven en CoyoacnChangolen estudio la licenciatura en psicologa en la UNAM, pero el alcohol lo transform. No se sabe con exactitud los motivos que indujeron a Samuel a cambiar su vida estudiantil, por la de la calle, aunque se dice que fue por una desilusin amorosa.[1]    Salt a la televisin mexicana, por un descubrimiento del programa Toma Libre como un borracho, de mano del conductor, Facundo. Usualmente era mostrado ante la TV en un estado de intoxicacin severa, actuando espontneamente en cualquier lugar que visitara, como por ejemplo: mercados, centros comerciales, avenidas, y calles concurridas. Durante algunos episodios disfruto de la fama, junto con algunos jvenes, asiduos del barrio de Coyoacn, donde, l usualmente sola residir.    La gente de la produccin de Incgnito comenta que Changolen, a quien para grabar un episodio, lo buscaban por ms de dos horas en todo Coyoacn. Deca tener hijos y una madre [2]. Y fue Facundo quin fue uno de sus grandes amigos y protector en sus ultimos a?os.    Algunas de sus frases ms famosas son:    Nada es absoluto...Todo es relativo   La charanda es algo grandioso   Que se mueran los guapos   Hola princesa mucho gusto, me pongo a sus pies   Soy ms coherente cuando callo.   Oiga si?or...aste no sabe onde vivo?   Oiga si?or...que aste no sabe quen soy yo?   Se cree que el apodo se lo pusieron los demas indigentes que se juntan con el, y simplemente es por su fuerte olor, que implica dormir en las calles, y por la gran barba que lo caracteriza      Cultura Popular  Tal ha sido la fama que ha tenido Changolon que gran cantidad de personas que llegaban a visitar Coyoacn, lo buscaban para platicar y tomarse una foto con l. El actor Herson Andrade actualmente imita a Changolon en el programa de televisin La Parodia, as como en la obra de teatro El Tenorio Cmico.      Rumor de su Fallecimiento  El 3 de mayo de 2006 se dio la noticia de que inesperadamente muere a causa de un Paro cardiaco, a pesar de que estaba recibiendo atencin mdica a su grave alcoholismo. Esa fue la noticia que dio el mismo Facundo, conductor de Incgnito, sin embargo desminti tal noticia unas semanas despus, y el mismo Changolen reapareci en el programa.    En una entrevista que dio Changolen a una revista de espectculos, dijo que su ausencia se debi a que estaba internado en una clnica de Alcohlicos Annimos, pero que no tolero el ambiente que viva ah, y se fugo para volver a las calles.    Existe la especulacin de que Facundo invent el rumor de su fallecimiento, para no llevarlo a las transmisiones del programa Incgnito que realizaran desde Alemania por motivo de la Copa Mundial de Futbol de la FIFA del 2006, sin embargo esto no est confirmado.|`|CkVJnCQqaa	El changoleon es un bagabundo ke el programa de incognito iso famoso busaca en www.youtube.com  sobre el y alma mejor encuentras algo o tanbien puedes entrar a www.incognito.tv y le mandas un correo electronico a Facundo y ya esta resuelto|`|jiZ6hTieaa	si es lo que pienso..me hace mal que algunos lo hayan tomado en broma..antes me llegaron preguntas que lo nombraban..ahora miro el link para saber si es lo que pensaba...huy..no cre que era tan conocido..  me molest que se burlaran en vez de ayudarlo a salir de su adiccin...en fin..hay de todo aqu. un besote.    o sea..la "psicologa" es un camino ..difcil y si no encuentras otra salida..puede convertirse en un camino sin retorno.|`|tQHyMGawaa	mmmm... la verdad no s. :o|`|n7VIdDhiaa	metete a youtube y ponle changoleon incognito y va a salir  x cierto es un teporocho te vas a echar el reva con el

Putting naked babies on the screen, in theory, isn't supposed to cause sexual excitement (except for people who are sick).  As children get older, they obviously begin to mature physically and start to resemble adult figures, in which sexual connotations are more easilly made. In this situation, pornographic material can be made because its intention to arouse (unfortunately and disgustingly). And if we are going to get technical, they only show the baby's butt (crack) at most. If nothing else, Victoria Secrets and other lingerie commericals definitely show more and are made to arouse.  So, by definition anyways, they would be considered more pornographic (basically, what I'm saying is there is worse stuff on TV).|`|qeXzmhD2aa	because in child porn they make the childern do bad things. And in commercials the baby are just being cute and running around.

Algo que nunca estuve de acuerdo, con el Santo Rosario sobre que cuando un hijo se nos muere hay que tener gran resignacion Cristiana ante la voluntad divina.

Their symbol was a fist, hence the name "Boxers".|`|ix6DrRJjaa	In the 19th and early 20th Centuries few westerners had any idea what Kung Fu or martial arts was, besides boxing, their own sport.

So millions of "Boxers", as they were called by the west, tried bare handedly to oust the westerners from China, but millions were slaughtered in the process, and  so it was put down.|`|AA10691483	The Boxer Movement (Traditional Chinese: ; Simplified Chinese: ; Hanyu Pinyin: Yhtun Qy; literally "The Righteous and Harmonious Society Uprising") or Boxer Rebellion ( or ) was a Chinese rebellion from November 1899 to September 7, 1901, against foreign influence in areas such as trade, politics, religion and technology that occurred in China during the final years of the Manchu rule known as the Qing Dynasty. In traditional Western histories, the Boxers were condemned as a product of uncivilized, irrational, superstitious anti-foreignism among the common people. However, controversy still exists about the significance of the movement, and even today the Boxers are praised by the government of the People's Republic of China as patriotic anti-imperialists. Subsequent reforms implemented after the crises of 1900 laid the foundation for the end of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the modern Chinese Republic.

Here is information i found sure hope it helps.    Mutilation or maiming is an act or physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of the (human) body, usually without causing death.       Two Ugandan women whose lips have been cut off by Lord's Resistance Army rebels socializeThe term is usually used to describe the victims of accidents, torture, physical assault, or certain premodern forms of punishment. Acts of mutilation may include amputation, burning, circumcision, flagellation or wheeling. In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy. The traditional Chinese practices of lngch and foot binding are forms of mutilation that have captured the imagination of Westerners, as well as the now tourist centered "long-neck" people, a sub-group of the Karen known as the Padaung where women wear brass rings on their neck.[1] The act of tattooing is also considered a form of self-mutilation according to some cultural traditions, such as within the Muslim religion.[2] [3]       Sepik River, PNG. Tribal male initiation through excruciating scarificationSome tribes practice some ritual mutilation, e.g. scarification, as part of a rite of passage (e.g. initiation ritual).    Maiming, or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many races with various ethnical and religious significances, and was a customary form of physical punishment, especially applied on the principle of an eye for an eye    The concept of the "sacrificial esthetic" introduced in Eric Gans's Chronicle No. 184 entitled "Sacrificing Culture" describes a situation in which aesthetic forms remain sacrificial but have evolved from a necessary feature of social organization to a psychological element of the human condition. Gans concludes that art's sacrificial esthetic is essentially exhausted as a creative force and argues that the future lies with simulations, virtual realities in which the spectator plays a partially interactive role. His most significant claim is that "This end of the ability of the esthetic to discriminate between the sacrificial and the antisacrificial is not the end of art. On the contrary, it liberates the esthetic from the ethical end of justifying sacrifice." The consequence of the liberation of the ethical justification of sacrifice is the main concern of this essay.     Throughout the history of art we have encountered images of blood, from the representations of wounded animals in the cave paintings of Lascaux through century after century of brutal Biblical images, through history paintings depicting scenes of war, up through the many films of war, horror, and violence. Blood is now off the canvas, off the screen and sometimes literally in your face. It is no coincidence that this substance has intrigued artists throughout history. Blood is fascinating; it simultaneously represents purity and impurity, the sacred and the profane, life and death.    There are many expressions of the aesthetic that manifests itself in blood and flesh. The most familiar examples are evident in the current popularity of tattooing, piercing, branding and body modifications. These comprise the basic prerequisites for entry into the worlds of Modern Primitives, Vampire Culture, and The Fetish Scene. These highly ritualized subcultures evolved out of various aesthetic genres such as: Happenings, Body Art, Performance Art, Ritual Art, the Gothic Movement, and Hollywood. Originally the goal of these artists was personal transformation and attempts to reclaim the spiritual. The result was unconventional forms of the sacred manifested in art that attacked fundamental values of Western culture, provoking censorship on many levels of society. The culture war began. In this essay it will be argued that aesthetics now ideologically freed from ethical responsibility to society has evolved into an authentic sacrificial culture inclusive of ritual murder.    The Flesh    A phenomenon in contemporary art has been occurring in which blood is no longer merely represented but is actually being utilized for various art forms. Performance artist Chris Burden did not paint or sculpt a crucifixion; in 1974 in a work entitled "Trans-Fixed" he had himself crucified to a car. In the 1970s Burdens art performances also included having himself shot with a gun, punctured, burned and run over by a car. Burdens body became the ultimate sculptural material, the ultimate object. [images/interview "Interview with Chris Burden" http://www.artnode.se/burden/] Artist Gina Pane does art performances that consist of self-inflicted cuts to her body including her face. In 1971 she performed "Escalade non-anesthsie" in which she climbed a ladder that had blades attached to the steps. In 1972 in a performance entitled "The Conditioning (part I of "Auto-Portrait(s)," she laid down on an iron bed with very few crossbars that had fifteen long candles burning underneath. In 1974 in a performance entitled "Psyche" she kneeled in front of a mirror, put on make-up and proceeded to cut into her face with a razor blade. In 1975 in a performance entitled "Le corps pressenti" she made cuts between her toes with a razor blade so that the blood would create permanent stains on a plaster cast that her feet were resting on.

Of course  politicians and others will use Religion to gain power and money. Why? Because its an avenue that works; however, in what way does the lack of integrety, honesty or character in man suggest that God does not exist? If anything, that should make you  hope with all your heart that there is a God  because unless you are blind and deaf, or just asleep, the World is being flushed down a proverbial toilet - yes, certainly by those  who do wish for power and money, but also  by those who so desperately need to justify their vices and validate their disgusting lifestyles.  If you are a bank robber, the last thing you are gonna want to see is the blaring light being shone onto your deed by  the police; in the same way, a person cannot stand the glaring light of truth that  the Word of God shines on them - they wish to kill that light in order to feel "free" to continue with carte blanche. Get rid of that light; get rid of that God; we can now call our sins "right" and "legal" and "justified".  We can suggest that since there really is no God, there is also no consequence.  Feel free to continue in your delusion if it is what you choose; as a Christian, I would want it no other way.  Certainly, we do not want everyone to "act" or "pretend" to be  Godly - no, it is God's plan to allow each soul to show their real, honest and true colors. This will make the separation of wheat and chaff much easier and ever so  much more efficient, don't ya think?  This is why God does not reveal Himself;  as a teacher of the manuscripts, I'm asked that question several times per week: Why doesn't God just show himself and then we will all know He is real, and He is God, and then everything would be fine.   If God were to do that, you wouldn't be quite so blatent about showing your true colors now would you?  No, things are proceeding along the path of Gods plan and it is working very well, and moving forward at tremendous speed.

Desde la antigedad, el hombre siempre ha usado pintura, figuras, dibujos y esculturas, entre otros, para darse a entender o explicar algo. Estos medios sirven para ayudar a visualizar lo invisible; para explicar lo que no se puede explicar con palabras. Cuando el hombre cay por el pecado y perdi la intimidad con Dios, comenz a confundir a Dios con otras cosas y a darles culto como si fueran dioses. Este culto se representaba frecuentemente con esculturas o imgenes idoltricas. La prohibicin del Declogo contra las imgenes se explica por la funcin de tales representaciones.    Sin embargo, an cuando muchas personas piensan que el primer mandamiento prohibe respeto a las imgenes esto no es necesariamente as. El culto cristiano a lo que representan las imgenes no es contrario al primer mandamiento porque el honor que se rinde a una imagen pertenece a quien en ella es representado. Es decir, al que se venera no a la imagen sino a lo que sta representa.    En ese sentido, Santo Toms de Aquino en su monumental Summa Theologiae se?ala que "el culto de la religin no se dirige a las imgenes en s mismas como realidades, sino que las mira bajo su aspecto propio de imgenes que nos conducen a Dios encarnado. Ahora bien, el movimiento que se dirige a la imagen en cuanto tal, no se detiene en ella, sino que tiende a la realidad de la que es imagen".  Incluso ya en el Antiguo Testamento, Dios orden o permiti la institucin de imgenes que conduciran simblicamente a la salvacin por el Verbo encarnado, y como ejemplo de ellos tenemos la serpiente de bronce o el arca de la alianza y los querubines.    Ahora bien, las primeras comunidades cristianas representaron a Jess con imgenes del Buen Pastor; ms adelante aparecern las del Cordero Pascual y otros iconos representando la vida de Cristo. Las imgenes han sido siempre un medio para dar a conocer y transmitir la fe en Cristo y la veneracin y amor a la Santsima Virgen y a los santos. Prueba de ellos, son las catacumbas -la mayora ubicadas en Roma- donde an se conservan imgenes hechas por los primeros cristianos, como las catacumbas de Santa Priscila, pintadas en la primera mitad del siglo III.     Sin embargo, con la encarnacin de Jesucristo se inaugur una nueva economa de las imgenes. Cristo tom y rescat las ense?anzas del Antiguo Testamento y le dio una interpretacin ms perfecta en su propia persona. Antes de Cristo nadie poda ver el rostro de Dios; en Cristo Dios se hizo visible. Antes de Jess las imgenes con frecuencia representaban a dolos, se usaban para la idolatra. Ahora, el verdadero Dios quiso tomar imagen humana ya que l es la imagen visible del Padre.     Sobre tu posicin es similar a que yo te asegurara que eres homsexual y por ms que me justifiques con toda clase de pruebas Yo siga diciendo que para m eres homosexual, la comparacin parecer poco amorosa pero esa es tu posicin.

6db594b65b6117a480077dcbcbd7f3e8aa	Jesus did not give up being God, He merely began to obey the Father as though He were a creature (Jn 12:49-50). This is called "Biblical subordination". Think of the concept of subordination this way: The President of the U.S. has a role that is functionally greater than my role in society. But, both the President and I share the same position or essence (ontology) on the humanity scale: we are both human beings.     Christs functional subordination does not mean He gave up his ontological equality with God the Father or God the Holy Spirit. A subordination in roles is within acceptable Biblical and creedal parameters, but a subordination in POSITION or ESSENCE (the "ontological" aspect) is a heretical (non-Christian) view called subordinationism. One cannot downgrade Christs ontological equality with God the Father or God the Holy Spirit and claim to be a Trinitarian. One cannot claim to be a Christian and not believe in the doctrine of the Trinity.    This ontological downgrading of Christ is a mistake made by both Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses. The JWs align with the ancient Arian position of Christ as a "created being" -- differing from Mormons mainly on the point that Jesus was not in some sense eternal. JWs say Jesus was created before the universe, but was not eternal. The JWs rightly recognize Jesus' **functional subordination** to the Father; but for some reason don't understand that Trinitarianism recognizes it as well. Trinitarianism has always allowed for **functional subordination** in the Trinity. But JWs deny Jesus' **ontological equality** with God the Father. Christ is, the JWs say, a completely separate being from the Father and that the Trinity is a construct of Greek philosophy! Unfortunately, this is what the Mormons say, too, although they come to a different conclusion ultimately about the solution. This in spite of the fact that their own view, essentially Arianism, was far more dependent on Greek philosophical categories which had problems ascribing divinity to anything material.    Whom do Men say that I am?    Authentic Trinitarianism may be viewed as a delicate balancing act between modalism and tritheism.    Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints/Mormons   * Christ is the product of a sexual relationship between the Father and a goddess. Satan is his brother.    Jehovahs Witnesses   * Jesus (also known as Michael the archangel) is a creation and the Holy Spirit is a force.    Muslims   * Christ was a great prophet.

vgDsEwqTaa	Haha, being a "FOB" is definitely coined by Asians. New Asian Immigrants tend have such distant and funny quarks therefore it's very obvious when someone is a FOB! I think it's a funny and endearing term, when used correctly.    But I am sure if you know how a Sweddish Immigrant can have funny quarks, I am sure you can call them a FOB too.|`|vNnsOyKBaa	I've only ever heard the term applied to Asians. It comes from the acronym "FOB" which stands for "fresh off the boat" indicating that that person has only been in the US for a short time.

In 1929, Einstein told Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein "I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind." (Brian 1996, p. 127)    Einstein defined his religious views in a letter he wrote in response to those who claimed that he worshipped a Judeo-Christian god: "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."[37][38]    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstien|`|S7E3MnHNaa	the god of the bible doesnt exist. end of story    I do believe the possibility that god is the set of natural laws that govern the universe|`|BEkx77abaa	You insult us with "I know not half of you will understand this" - and then expect an intelligent response??

An atheist, on the other hand, even though he may belong to a religious family, uses his intellect to deny the existence of God; what ever concept or qualities of God he may have learnt in his religion may not seem to be logical to him.   My Muslim brothers may question me, "Zakir, why are you congratulating an atheist?" The reason that I am congratulating an atheist is because he agrees with the first part of the Shahada i.e. the Islamic Creed, La ilaaha - meaning there is no God. So half my job is already done; now the only part left is il lallah i.e. BUT ALLAH which I shall do Insha Allah. With others (who are not atheists) I have to first remove from their minds the wrong concept of God they may have and then put the correct concept of one true God.  LOGICAL CONCEPT OF GOD   My first question to the atheist will be: "What is the definition of God?" For a person to say there is no God, he should know what is the meaning of God. If I hold a book and say that this is a pen, for the opposite person to say, it is not a pen, he should know what is the definition of a pen, even if he does not know nor is able to recognise or identify the object I am holding in my hand. For him to say this is not a pen, he should at least know what a pen means. Similarly for an atheist to say there is no God, he should at least know the concept of God. His concept of God would be derived from the surroundings in which he lives. The god that a large number of people worship has got human qualities - therefore he does not believe in such a god. Similarly a Muslim too does not and should not believe in such false gods.  If a non-Muslim believes that Islam is a merciless religion with something to do with terrorism; a religion which does not give rights to women; a religion which contradicts science; in his limited sense that non-Muslim is correct to reject such Islam. The problem is he has a wrong picture of Islam. Even I reject such a false picture of Islam, but at the same time, it becomes my duty as a Muslim to present the correct picture of Islam to that non-Muslim i.e. Islam is a merciful religion, it gives equal rights to the women, it is not incompatible with logic, reason and science; if I present the correct facts about Islam, that non-Muslim may Inshallah accept Islam.  Similarly the atheist rejects the false gods and the duty of every Muslim is to present the correct concept of God which he shall Insha Allah not refuse.     (You may refer to my article, Concept of God in Islam, for more details)  QURAN AND MODERN SCIENCE   The methods of proving the existence of God with usage of the material provided in the Concept of God in Islam to an atheist may satisfy some but not all.   Many atheists demand a scientific proof for the existence of God. I agree that today is the age of science and technology. Let us use scientific knowledge to kill two birds with one stone, i.e. to prove the existence of God and simultaneously prove that the Quran is a revelation of God.  If a new object or a machine, which no one in the world has ever seen or heard of before, is shown to an atheist or any person and then a question is asked, " Who is the first person who will be able to provide details of the mechanism of this unknown object? After little bit of thinking, he will reply, the creator of that object. Some may say the producer while others may say the manufacturer. What ever answer the person gives, keep it in your mind, the answer will always be either the creator, the producer, the manufacturer or some what of the same meaning, i.e. the person who has made it or created it. Dont grapple with words, whatever answer he gives, the meaning will be same, therefore accept it.  SCIENTIFIC FACTS MENTIONED IN THE QURAN: for details on this subject please refer to my book, THE QURAN AND MODERN SCIENCE  COMPATIBLE OR INCOMPATIBLE?  THEORY OF PROBABILITY   In mathematics there is a theory known as Theory of Probability. If you have two options, out of which one is right, and one is wrong, the chances that you will chose the right one is half, i.e. one out of the two will be correct. You have 50% chances of being correct. Similarly if you toss a coin the chances that your guess will be correct is 50% (1 out of 2) i.e. 1/2. If you toss a coin the second time, the chances that you will be correct in the second toss is again 50% i.e. half. But the chances that you will be correct in both the tosses is half multiplied by half (1/2 x 1/2) which is equal to 1/4 i.e. 50% of 50% which is equal to 25%. If you toss a coin the third time, chances that you will be correct all three times is (1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2) that is 1/8 or 50% of 50% of 50% that is 12?%.  A dice has got six sides. If you throw a dice and guess any number between 1 to 6, the chances that your guess will be correct is 1/6. If you throw the dice the second time, the chances that your guess will be correct in both the throws is (1/6 x 1/6) which is equal to 1/36. If you throw the dice the third time, the chances that all your three guesses are correct is (1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6) is equal to 1/216 that is less than 0.5 %.  Let us apply this theory of probability to the Quran, and assume that a person has guessed all the information that is mentioned in the Quran which was unknown at that time. Let us discuss the probability of all the guesses being simultane|`|IjYWi3VEaa	if you don't know then you know now thanks to the 2ed answer|`|GhTkAWERaa	god created earth. he picked mother mary to give birh to his only son jesus by the holy spirit .he loves his people so much to the  point that he sent his only son to fie on the cross  to help us from devil's sin

12b0d2dde2aed3ea638f23fda7efdc96aa	Pruebas FEACIENTES??    hasta ahora no le ninguna,   no creo que alguien la encuentre  en ninguna respuesta,    Todos saben que no,  las sensaciones personales no sirven como prueba.    Ninguna prueba aportada por la iglesia y sus telogos nos prueba la existencia de dios, mejor (de sus tres dioses mejor dicho). Son pruebas contra la razn, la lgica y la verdad, que nos dan la tranquilidad necesaria para decir nuevamente y con toda seguridad esta verdad:   DIOS NO EXISTE.   Lo cual obviamente no es un dogma de fe: si a pesar de ello usted quiere seguir creyendo en dios, rezndole, manteniendo a los vagos que se dicen sus representantes y echndole la culpa de no ganarse la lotera, esta usted en libertad de hacerlo... le aseguramos que dios no se enterara.    Los que tienen que demostrar que existe, son los creyentes ya que sobre ellos recae el peso de la prueba.    Es lo mismo que yo tenga que probar que en la galaxia de Andrmeda, hay un televisor encendido en el canal Discovery Channel. Yo no lo creo entonces,   ?qu tengo que demostar?    La evolucin est comprobada, por numerosas ciencias:  Qumica, Gentica, Biologa, Antropologa, Paleontologa,   Geologa, Fsica, Astromona, Embriologa, Fisiologa comparada, etc.  El Australopitecus (3.000.000 de a?os) es el eslabn perdido pese a quien le pese.    La ciencia de la lgica dice que:  "todos lo cuervos son ******, hasta que aparezca el primer cuervo blanco" (Corroborar). Entonces dios no existe hasta que aparezca. OK??    Si fuimos creados, en lugar de ser producto del proceso evolutivo ?cmo explica que tengamos la misma frmula dental (2123/2123) que los grandes simios, si con esto tenemos problemas con las cordales? ?Por qu tenemos los msculos extensores y flexores de los dedos del pe con una estructura propia de los grandes simios que trepan a los rboles?

Tu cres que todo ese orden, esa complejidad, inmensa, por no decir infinita, que reina el universo, es producto de la casualidad. Pues no. Todo orden, tiene que haber una fuerza superior que lo creo. Nada es producto de la casualidad. Si ves una caba?a en una isla, a poco piensas, que bella es la naturaleza, mira ha creado una caba?a, verdad que no. Sabes muy bien que esa caba?a es obra de una inteligencia, muy probablemente humana. Es obvio, tuvo que ser alguien con herramientas. No la pudo haber construido un mono, o un gato verdad. Asi mismo al ver el orden de la naturaleza, sabes que hay un Dios creador. Por pura lgica e inteligencia.    Aquel que viendo la naturaleza, no cre en Dios. Es un necio.     Como ejemplo te cito, que 2 de los ms grandes cientficos que ha tenido la humanidad, pioneros en sus reas. Albert Einstein y Louis Pasteur. Entre muchos otros hombres de ciencia. Han sido creyentes.     Albert Eintein dijo; "Dios no juega a los dados".    Louis Pasteur dijo; "Un poco de ciencia te aleja de Dios, pero mucha ciencia te acerca ms a El."    Hubo otro cientfico, que no me acuerdo el nombre, dijo; "El hombre encuentra a Dios, detrs de cada puerta, que la ciencia abre".     Ser ateo es una necedad.

Si estudiamos un poco de historia universal, encontramos pruebas de que todos los dioses fueron inventados en su momento por los pueblos quienes  los adoraban.  Ya no creen en Apolo, Zeus, Odin, Manitou, Quetzalcoatl.  Por que?  Por que las personas que creian en ellos ya no existen.  El dios judeo cristiano actual tambien existira mientras existan creyentes, de echo ya empieza a decaer la creencia,  por principo estamos los ateos, agnosticos, y otras religiones.  Despues estan los resentidos con su dios, estos creian tanto que al pedir algo como la salvacion de un enfermo y este muere, no lo aceptan, (conozco varios casos), incluso supe de una persona que quemo una iglesia de los testigos de jehoba.  El dios judeo cristiano, si se ponen a investigar, encontraran que derivo de una amalgama de otros dioses, que tenian otros nombres y provenian de otras culturas.  La misma biblia dice que el pueblo judio necesitaba un dios en que creer y moises no encontraba la forma de aplacar a su pueblo.  Claro que al principio el dios era muy malo y vengativo, con el tiempo lo fueron humanizando, segun se fue civilizando la poblacion.  Actualmente hay infinidad de creyentes que ya rompieron con las religiones, por una causa u otra y se aferran a la creencia de un dios, pero este no es el dios de la biblia.  mensajes como "no creo en las religiones pero creo que existe dios y mi dios es asi: El es amor , el me ama y yo lo amo, etc.    Finalmente un dios a gusto y manera del creyente o a su libre albedrio, no es un dios,  Y que de   su contraparte el dios del mal, satanaz, que en realidad jamaz ha echo da?o a la humanidad, primero porque no existe y segundo , documentado en la biblia.  Segun esta el dioscristiano ha echo mas da?o a la humanidad que que nadie.    Atte.

En principio, la cesrea se utilizaba slo en situaciones extremas, cuando se prevea la muerte y era la nica forma de salvar el feto.

Suele practicarse cuando un parto vaginal podra conducir a complicaciones mdicas.    No se debe confundir con la episiotoma, que es una incisin en el perin para facilitar el parto. La cesrea se hace por encima de la pelvis.    Hay muchos elementos que contribuyen a una explicacin lingstica de la palabra ?cesrea?:    El trmino podra derivarse del verbo latino caedere, ?cortar?.   Posiblemente haya tomado su nombre del gobernante romano Julio Csar, de quien se dice vino al mundo de esta manera. Histricamente es improbable, porque su madre estaba viva despus de que ste llegara a la adultez, pero la leyenda ya se contaba en el siglo II dC.   La ley romana prescriba que el procedimiento deba llevarse a cabo al final del embarazo en una mujer moribunda con el fin de salvar al beb. La ley se llam lex caesarea, y este trmino puede ser el origen del nombre.   Muy probablemente es una combinacin de lo anterior. El inicio de la historia es casi con certeza el verbo caedo: la frase ?a matre caesus? (?cortado de su madre?) se usaba en Roma para describir la operacin. La etimologa real del nombre Csar (un apellido mucho ms antiguo) no est relacionada, pero una etimologa popular muy temprana invent la historia del nacimiento de Julio Csar por este procedimiento para poder sugerir que su nombre se derivaba del verbo. El ttulo de la lex caesarea debe de estar influido por esta leyenda, porque la forma caesarus no puede ser derivada directamente de caesus sin alguna interferencia de Caesar. En alemn se dice Kaiserschnitt (literalmente, ?el corte del emperador?), sin duda proveniente de forma directa de la leyenda del nacimiento de Julio Csar.       Tipos  [editar]Hay muchas clases de cesreas:    La incisin clsica es longitudinal en la lnea media, lo que permite mayor espacio para el parto. Se usa rara vez, porque es ms susceptible de complicaciones.   La ms comn hoy en da es la del segmento inferior, en la cual se hace un corte transversal justo por encima del borde de la vejiga. La prdida de sangre es menor y la reparacin ms fcil.   Una histerectoma cesrea es el parto mediante cesrea y posterior extraccin del tero, que se puede realizar en casos de sangrado intratable o cuando la placenta no se puede separar del tero.   Algunas veces se han practicado otros tipos, como la extraperitoneal o la de Porro.      Cesrea en progresoActualmente se insta al padre para que presencie la operacin con el fin de apoyar y compartir la experiencia con su pareja. El anestesilogo usualmente descubre temporalmente el campo cuando el beb est saliendo para que los padres puedan verlo.       Indicaciones  [editar]Los gineclogos recomiendan la cesrea cuando el parto vaginal puede ser arriesgado para el ni?o o la madre. Algunas posibles razones son:    trabajo de parto prolongado o distocia   sufrimiento fetal aparente   sufrimiento maternal aparente   complicaciones como pre-eclampsia o eclampsia   nacimientos mltiples   mala colocacin del bebe, (cabeza hacia arriba en lugar de hacia la pelvis)   presentacin anormal   induccin del trabajo de parto fallida   parto instrumental fallido   beb muy grande (macrosoma)   placenta muy baja o placenta previa   pelvis contrada   evidencia de infeccin intrauterina   algunas veces, cesrea previa   problemas de curacin del perin, derivados del parto o de la Enfermedad de Crohn, por ejemplo.   Sin embargo, diferentes especialistas pueden diferir en cuanto a sus opiniones sobre la recomendacin de una cesrea. Un obstetra puede sentir que una mujer es muy peque?a para parir a su beb, pero otro puede estar en desacuerdo. De forma similar, algunos proveedores de cuidado pueden determinar que el parto no progresa ms rpidamente que otros. Estos desacuerdos ayudan a explicar por que las tasas de cesreas son diferentes entre hospitales y mdicos.       Riesgos  [editar]Las estadsticas de los noventas sugieren que menos de una mujer por cada 2.500 que tengan cesrea morir, comparado con una en 10.000 para el parto vaginal[1]. La mortalidad sigue en descenso, y el Servicio Nacional de Salud del Reino Unido declar que el riesgo de muerte es tres veces el de un parto vaginal [2]. Sin embargo, no es posible comparar directamente las tasas de mortalidad de los partos vaginales y por cesrea porque las mujeres que tuvieron la ciruga tenan mayor riesgo.    Los bebs nacidos por cesrea suelen tener problemas iniciales para respirar. Adems puede ser difcil la alimentacin porque tanto la madre como el beb estn afectados por la medicacin para el dolor.    Una cesrea es una ciruga mayor, con todos los riesgos y eventos que conlleva. El dolor en la incisin puede ser intenso, y la recuperacin completa de la movilidad puede tomar semanas.       Prevalencia  [editar]La Organizacin Mundial de la Salud estima que la tasa de cesreas entre todos los nacimientos en los pases desarrollados est entre el 10% y el 15%, comparado con cerca de 20% en el Reino Unido y 23% en Estados Unidos. En 2003, la tasa de cesreas en Canad fue de 21%, con variaciones regionales.    En a?os recientes se han generado preocupacin porque la operacin se realice frecuentemente por otras razones diferentes a la necesidad mdica. Por ejemplo, a los crticos les preocupa que las cesreas se realicen porque econmicamente dan ms utilidad para el hospital, o porque una cesrea rpida es ms conveniente para un obstetra que un largo parto vaginal.

Voici la version intgrale:    Ab? Nujayd `Imram ibn al-Hunayn al-Khuza'? rapporte qu'une femme de la tribu des Juhayna vint voir le Prophte Mohamed alors qu'elle portait en son sein un enfant adultrin et lui dit :    "O Envoy de Dieu, je me suis expose au chatiment en commettant l'adultre. Fais appliquer la peine."     Cette femme a t voir le prophte spontanment car elle tait rong par les remords...    Le Prophte fit venir son tuteur et lui dit :    "Montre-toi bienveillant envers elle et lorsqu'elle aura mis au monde son enfant, amne-la moi." Celui-ci s'excuta.     Le prophte ordonna qu'on la ligote dans ses vtements, puis qu'on la lapide. Ensuite il dirigea la prire funraire pour cette femme...Urnar l'interrogea    "O Envoy de Dieu tu diriges la prire des morts pour une femme adultre ?    - Son repentir tait tel, rpliqua le Prophte qu'il aurait suffi  obtenir le pardon de soixante-dix Mdinois et qu'y a-t-il de plus mritoire que le don qu'elle fit d'elle-mme  Dieu ?    Donc cette femme s'est elle mme sacrifie pour la cause divine et sa mort equivaut a une repentance...    Le pardon de Dieu vaut mieux que toutes les richesses de la terre non??      je ne fais que te citer l'intgralit du hadith que tu mentionne il en va de la probit de ta question    MON AVIS : c'est que tout d'abord le hadith que tu cites est contest par de nombreux docteurs en sciences islamiques, La question de la lapidation est vraiment problmatique en Islam parce quelle nest jamais mentionne dans le Coran comme chatiment possible des adultres. Elle est cependant pratique sur la base de Hadith tenus par le prophte dont la vracit pose problme  de nombreux exgtes. Dans le Coran, texte fondateur de lIslam, il ny a aucune trace dincitation  la lapidation. Ce sujet nest pas voqu. Mme si le Coran,  plusieurs reprises, rpte que ladultre est un acte mauvais, un crime dont il faut sloigner, vous ne trouverez pas la lapidation cite comme chatiment de cet acte pourtant fortement rprouv.

He has one goal: to communicate with spirits. Not all who play are aware of the evil they do not necessarily have the desire to offend God, at least in our culture that many do not have Christian formation. But not for that reason ceases to be the spiritual Ouija a serious danger.    Maybe the player does not believe in spirits and think the game works by coincidence or otherwise, as energies of the mind, and so on. But usually when you know at least what the course objective and play it anyway, perhaps as a challenge, for ridicule, for challenge or out of curiosity. In any case it is meddling in the murky area of the occult. It is not on the board if the problem but the heart that makes use of it.    The evil has its consequences but is in between their networks by ignorance, blindly led by the flow of the atmosphere, by deception or difficult situations to avoid. Many young people who get into drugs or prostitution, for example, were not fully aware of the evil that fell. Why not stop ruining their lives. I do not want to condemn, but rather seek warn of the danger and, if it has fallen into, announce that in Christ there is forgiveness and new life.    Many good Christians do not understand the harm of the Ouija because they do not understand the reality of the spiritual battle and the action of evil spirits. That's why it must be alerted to the danger without clutches, but also the infinite mercy of God who wants to liberate us and forgive us.    Should I ask if anything bad happens to you  First I must tell you that something does happen in your contact with the Ouija.  The devil has managed to poison your soul and make you believe that it is better to be on their side. Having achieved that does not need more. It is precisely why I say that the Ouija is not a game but a malicious tool of the devil.    Dear __, God is your Father, you created out of love for you to be happy with Him all eternity. Everything good, beautiful, loving God is. The only loves us infinitely. The devil invites you to renounce God and you promise things. Rather invites you to abuse what God has created. But what is worth having the whole world if you lose your soul?. Nothing in this world worth if we deviate from God.  We must renounce the devil  Why renounce the devil?. Because he is a murderer with his lies that we want to remove the love of God. You want to buy things when they belong to God. You want to reduce their selfishness and perversion when you were created to love and be loved.    It provides for the love of Jesus that we died on the Cross. These time. Renunciation of the devil and open your heart to Jesus Christ's mercy.    You say that nothing bad will happen with the Ouija. I'm telling you if: Every time you play will be away from the truth to adhere more to look at the Ouija. This seems to say nice things. Is the strategy of the devil, because you know that talking about "nice" is the best way of deception. The devil is still has to make good if you can fool with it and earn your trust. Later, having done good to go through, it will be easier to guide them to sin and trapped souls. Understand that the devil is clever and is like a roaring lion looking for who to devour.    It is God whom we must seek with all their heart. No to the Ouija. Why go to the Ouija? Because curiosity that gives them talk of spirits beyond. But know that God has communicated with us and continues to communicate by the way that he has established. There is no other. The talks to us through His Word, The Holy Bible and Apostolic Tradition. Shows us the whole truth in the Church, gives us good people who respect and obey God. The gives us His Body and Blood in the Eucharist, forgive us our sins in confession. He is alive and if we really open our hearts, we will know each other, to love and communicate with him beautifully. Read the lives of the saints and you will see that you too can be good.

If you use a Ouija board, and ask questions, you will get answers. Who, or what is answering you is up to you to decide. Even if it is just a construct of your own mind, your subconscious taking an opportunity to talk to you, that doesn't mean that the communication is without value.     Sometimes in order to get some communication with other parts of your personality and mind, you have to use a trick of computer programmers, and access it in indirect means...

Yes, some of the time it is fake, but a lot of the time it's downright devil-worship, so I wouldn't recommend it.  I've never used it before, but I've heard stories from people I trust about such things.      to the poster above me:  what do you mean "it doesn't matter who sends the email, it just matters what the email says" (or something like that)?  If the devil told you to do a good deed and an angel told you to kill someone, what would you think???|`|cXXJVz64aa	No. One or more people that are at the board are moving it.|`|UU6xMVBmaa	no they don't. they work on mind power. the power of your mind to make stuff up, like monsters in the closet|`|f0dd8e92e5f4fd4207cd0c49e42ce6beaa	I've seen experiments conducted where the Ouija board "players" used a Ouija board and got some coherent messages, and then were blindfolded and attempted again. The messages were nonsensical and were essentially random letters and numbers.

So, in short, no, unless a Ouija board is supposed to say whatever you expect it to say.|`|nVmntfwUaa	Yes they are BUT if you don't know what you're doing, they can be quite dangerous to use.

Did you realize that it doesn't say "God will kill them?"    That passage in Deuteronomy has nothing to do with sons, it talks about finding dead and measuring them to the nearest city, then breaking a heifer's neck and....      I'm going to just quit now...    and remember, the Bible was written inspired by God, who knows if these are his actual thoughts.    Also, Homo is derogatory and God didn't kill Satan because God loves Satan just as he loves everyone else.|`|I11BEwi5aa	Examining Christianity is like trying to make sense out of a B-movie.

Yes that is correct  Those who rebel against God and reject him go to hell  Those who accept him and follow him go to heaven    Why does he need 2 test us so badly?   We are choosing in this life with are free choice to either follow god or reject him. Those who accept him will live on a new earth in a eternal body anda eternal soul. Those who reject in a eternal body and soul in a eternal lake of fire.    He doesn't have faith in what he has created?   Yes he does. he gave man the choice to want to serve and follow him. He did not want mindless robots.      He order deaths of his children but not Satan?   Physical people die.  Satan a spiritual being has eternal life and a eternal body as do the physical beings have a eternal soul. Their physical body dies but the eternal spirit lives on. The physical body will be changed into a spiritual body one day.    God gave made his creation eternal as he is eternal. The angels he made with eternal bodies already. mankind is given eternal spirit with physical body to choose to serve God or reject him.|`|UU6xMVBmaa	idk what bible you got your scripture from, but God chose not to kill Satan because he's not a real threat|`|txlYyZO1aa	Why couldn't he kill Hitler by having him get hit by a stray bullet during WWI? How hard would that have been. He's god so he should be able to wave his magic wand and make anything happen, right?|`|XvQLktmMaa	Im NOT a christian but think about this...     If God had killed satan or put him away for good, where would that leave God? As a supreme being God would naturally have to have an enemy. If he is all good and holy he would need something or someone to show the world what he is not in order to compare himself. No one can call themselves perfect at something until they have proved that they are without blemish. In order to do that they would need someone who is not perfect to compare themselves.   Perhaps you should consider finding something else to invest your time in, other than dead "gods". |`|GjmyByw0aa	Well the verses you got from the Bible are the "OLD TESTAMENT" -- That is the "Torah"    The Torah (Jewish Holy Book) and the New Testament combined = Bible.    But Chrisitianity is concentrated in the "New Testament" not the Old, the Old is the Jewish one.
OfRITFHAaa	You get to heaven by being born again . Basically that means that , we are not separated from God anymore , our sin separated us from God . Once Christ is believed and accepted ,as the lamb of God for our sins , we then have no sin and God we once again can be connected to God , and He put his spirit in us , which then makes us born Again .     Because when adam and eve sinned , they not only died physically but sin separated their spirit , in which God breath into man , that was the life of man , and what made man Intelligent and not just a ape .     That spirit of God that God put in man , was then separated from God , almost like if you took a glass of water and separated it from the ocean , it would evaporate and die .     So man apart from God was going to die physically , and the spirit of man was not going to return back to God (like water to the ocean after if evaporates ) But was going to be separated from God and die .     But when are sins are removed , are body still dies , but the spirit being born of God and is connected to God again , is then able to return to God , who is life , and without him we have no life , just like a glass of water separated from the ocean would be no more .     So once we acept Christ and are born again , then to have life all we have to do for the rest of our life is stay connected to Christ .     That means not to walk back into sin . If we walk back into sin , and stay there , we then can't be saved .     But if we sin , and ask Christ to forgive us of our sins even after we are saved , he forgives us and we stay connected to Christ .     So to get to heaven you have to alway repent of sins , and ask forgiveness of sins .     If we give up and walk back into sins , God will not stay with us , because he can't dwell with sin and we will die .     But if we don't quit and ask for forgivness of sins , we keep ourself joined with God and his spirit and we have life . |`|euo0j3NTaa	When you are dead, you can see God when you are being killed.|`|NXQHQ9z2aa	 Take I 7 north then go strait up.|`|UU6xMVBmaa	a- its in every version of the bible|`|IcbSS6dQaa	You must confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and that he died for our sins.

Getting to heaven doesn't make sense and all people don't follow 2) that i have...      1) Luke 18:18-21 says "And a certain ruler questioned him saying: 'Good Teacher, by doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?' Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good, except for one, God. You know the ten commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.'"      But in Luke 14:26 "'If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own soul, he cannot be my disciple.'"      In order to be "saved" u have to follow Luke 18:18-21 but then wat he says in Luke 14:26 just doesn't make sense! One doesn't go wit the other! So u can be his disciple but won't have everlasting life or go 2 heaven?      2)In Luke 18: 21-30, the ruler said he does honor his father, mother and blah blah blah so Jesus said he hasn't done one thing which is "sell all the things you have and give it to the poor and you will have treasures in heavens; and come be my follower..."      So in order to get to heaven, you have to sell all your possessions as Jesus said? What priest or pastor sells all his stuff 2 the poor? Some r rolling in money... such as the Pope! Sure he give stuff 2 the poor but not EVERYTHING as the Bible says!|`|XvQLktmMaa	How can you "ask" a supposed God into your life? Either they are there or their not.

However, police from our history have been cruel and unjust. Remember the suffragettes?

Depends on what you hear.|`|AA11599959	When I was a teen on the edge of life and barely clinging to make it to adulthood, I was blessed with a neighbor that was a Watch Commander for our local PD. He took me under his wing, I met allot of cops...most were cops for the same ideal reason, to care for those who needed help and to keep the community safe and a good place to live.   The stuff they see and deal with tends to harden them, otherwise how could they survive the abuse they see perpetrated upon  so many innocents. How tough it is to see people destroy their lives and others lives...then try to stop the destruction...it's brutal. Being a cop is not unlike being a soldier...they risk their lives for all of us so that we can enjoy freedom, safety and peace of mind. They sacrifice a normal life, sacrifice friends, and get allot of negativity for their giving of their lives. A cop is on duty to protect society 24/7...always in combat, always ready to serve and defend YOU and ME!    Do I like the Police...Damned straight I do! And furthermore I give them credit for me being who I am today; a Mom, a wife and a decent hard working person. Cops are unsung hero's.

Without them, we would live in chaos and danger, every single one of us. You couldn't walk in the city or drive on the streets. The idea that they "abuse their power" is an exaggeration, at best. 90% of people, I'm willing to bet, who say they do are simply lawbreakers and are making excuses for their bad behavior. The other 10% are too gullible with their anecdotal examples. Yes, there are corrupt cops, and you see them in the news all the time. But I have worked with law enforcement in the past, and my experience is that for every corrupt cop, there are 100 good ones that are risking their very lives every day to keep us safe. Unfortunately, those ones don't make it into the news. I think people who refuse to recognize this fact ought to be ashamed of themselves. |`|KunTVFmUaa	like|`|DxbaEPbUaa	i appreciate everything they do for the community! they put their lives on the line every day!|`|LmaGaIosaa	In general love them.

" E disse Deus: Fa?amos o homem  nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhan?a; e domine sobre os peixes do mar, e sobre as aves dos cus, e sobre todo o gado, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo rptil que se move sobre a terra "                        Gnesis 1.26               Meu amigo, o homem n?o veio a existir por evolu??o do macaco e nem de nenhum  do seu ancestral; Quando algum afirma que o homem  descendente do macaco, est blasfemando contra Deus e ofendendo-O, porque a Bblia Sagrada nos afirma que o homem  descendente do prprio Deus; o macaco  uma criatura criada por Deus, assim como todos os animais. Mas o homem  a semelhan?a de Deus, fora criado igual a Deus. A doutrina que ensina que o homem  descendente do macaco,  terrena, carnal e diablica, e nessa mentira, muitos se tem embrenhado e se encontram perdidos. A Bblia Sagrada,  a nossa nica bssola que pode nos ensinar o caminho de volta para o cu, pois o esprito que em ns habita provm do cu. Veja:          " E formou o Senhor Deus o homem do p da terra e soprou em suas narinas o f?lego da vida; e o homem foi feito alma vivente "  Gnesis 2.7          Veja que o o homem s passou a ter vida depois que Deus soprou em suas narinas; esse sopro  conhecido como esprito de vida, ou seja, n?o vivemos sem ar, e esse ar que Deus soprou nas narinas do corpo do homem  uma fagulha do seu Esprito ( Pai, Filho e Esprito Santo ); o esprito de vida que est em ns, pertence a Deus. Veja:            " E o p volte  terra, como o era, e o esprito volte a Deus, que o deu "                        Eclesistes 12.7                Esse esprito, mencionado acima,  o f?lego de vida que vimos l em Gnesis 2.7               " Disse Jesus: E conhecereis a verdade, e a verdade vos libertar "                      S. Jo?o 8.32             Quando voc come?a a ler a Bblia Sagrada e come?a a dar lugar a tudo que est escrito nela, voc come?a a descobrir a verdadeira paz e o verdadeiro amor.               " Examinais as Escrituras, porque vs cuidais ter nelas a vida eterna, e s?o elas que de mim testificam "                     S.Jo?o 5.39                 " Se, pois, o Filho vos libertar, verdadeiramente, sereis livres ".                         S.Jo?o 8.36                 Talvz voc pergunte: ser livre de qu ?                Livre das mentiras, da hipocrisia, da prostitui??o, da fornica??o, dos adultrios, do dio, da raiz de amargura, do vcio do cigarro, do vcio das drogas em geral, livre do fracasso na vida, enfim, jesus Cristo, s Ele, tem o poder para nos transformar totalmente por dentro e por fora. Por que o pecado separa o homem de Deus, veja:         " Mas as vossas iniquidades fazem divis?o entre vs e o vosso Deus, e os vosso pecados encobrem o seu rosto de vs, para que vos n?o ou?a ".                        Isaias 59.2  Deus te aben??e e que o Esp[rito Santo te esclare?a melhor. Leia a Bblia Sagrada todos os dias e procure uma igreja evanglica de sua preferncia.|`|M2LkD0Mraa	Que tenha vindo do macaco ou de um ancestral comum ao macaco... Mas evolucao...

8urFS6RMaa	There's nothing inherently wrong with judging -- we wouldn't have a criminal justice system to punish felons if there was.|`|oDR80CiSaa	Christians are "fast to throw the don't judge card" because that's what their god/bible tells them - not to judge, because the situation is not for them to judge. (Or at least, I think so.)<br>  <br>  Atheists are "fast to throw the don't judge card" because Christians judge Atheists (as well as people of other religions) and Atheists are just showing them how they're not following their own "laws".<br>  <br>  Personally, I usually use my own judgment of the situation.|`|2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	Pointing out a person's flaws or faults is judging and if you don't want people pointing out your flaws, you shouldn't do it to them.  You can call a person on a lie.  That isn't judging them.  Ask that they tell you the truth or let them know you know they are lying.  Better yet, proof is even better!|`|Rj34Cur3aa	if you catch someone in a lie, of course, judge them.  they are doing wrong.  <br>  <br>  if someone doesn't believe...that's a whole other story. <br>  <br>  a) its none of your business<br>  b) who are YOU to say they are doing wrong?  <br>  c) butt out.  nunya.  skedaddle.  if someone doesn't believe, you cannot make them by judging them.  and that's exactly what you are doing.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	The trick is to demonstrate that they would benefit from behaving differently, but also establish that you don't consider yourself "better" than him just because you make different choices.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	You already judged.  You called them faults.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Telling some one they are lieing is not judging them.  It is a simple fact.  Just like we tell fundies they are not thinking - it is a simple fact.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Telling someone that stealing is wrong is fine but you cross the line when you tell them they are going to burn in hell for doing so.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	The idea that we don't judge people (or that Christians don't judge people) is complete crap!<br>  <br>  It is a lie and a cop out.<br>  <br>  We should all admit that we do... and need to... judge people.  Then we can finally have the discussion about what we should judge people for.<br>  <br>  MLK - judge a man by his character!|`|wwdllMzYaa	you dont tell them their faults<br>  its not your job to do is it?<br>  isnt that gods job, and their own job?<br>  <br>  <br>  if soemone lies to me, i have no idea if they lied or not, unless they are proven to have lied to me personally, and what can i do, lecture them?<br>  shout at them, demand they nto do it?<br>  no<br>  its entirely up to them to change<br>  not me, not you, no-one, but themselves|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	I don't tell my brother all his faults.  If my brother lies "to me" I talk to him about that.  I'd not judge and say why lying is wrong or why he shouldn't do it.  I'd simply talk in "me" messages.  "It hurts me when you lie to me.  I feel like this..."  etc|`|3QWGdZlAaa	where did you hear that Christians arent supposed to judge? we are supposed to judge each other so we can be convicted.|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	first remove the log from your own eye, then the splinter in his eye won't bother you|`|uFAoq4idaa	Rebuking a person in a loving and friendly manner is not judging. In fact an open rebuke is better than backbiting. When you say loving manner you are careful not to hurt his feelings. If you love somebody you don't want him to have heartaches and pains. Friendly manner is to have a closer relationship with him. Make him feel secured so he could trust you.<br>  Trust is an important factor in a friendship. People sinned because they do not have someone to trust and to lean on when they have problems. We are here to give them what they lacked for so many years. Make people see that we are trustworthy Christians then they will believe the things we may be sharing to them.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Atheists and Christians how can you tell your brother his faults without judging?<br>  <br>  One need merely read the bible to understand what is meant by the verb "to judge".  Throughout the biblical period, it was a judge's duty to<br>  a) determine innocence or guilt<br>  b) pass sentence<br>  <br>  It was not a judge's duty to realize that his neighbor was a fornicator, or that his other neighbor was a thief.  If he did so, it was not his duty to "judge" unless it was brought to trial with the required number of witnesses.<br>  <br>  So, informing someone that some sin they are committing *is* a sin is not judgment.  Quite the contrary, that is giving warning as demanded in Eze 3.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|M3sVQm2Maa	The only way you could call someone out on lying is if you have proof they are lying. Otherwise it is an accusation. <br>  If you simply have an opinion that what they are doing is wrong, then that is making a judgment. In that case you'd have to be good enough friends that the person would take your opinion into consideration. But it's still a judgment on your part. For instance, a friend of mine was spending many nights at her boyfriend's house and a friend of hers from her mother's church told her she was doing wrong and "sinning", etc. That was a judgment on her part, and while she thought she was being sincere, it was an unwelcome opinion.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	It's all in your wording...I caught my grandson stealing...I say, S, You know, when one steals they are taking something that does not belong to them. I saw you take this piece of candy without paying for it. What do you think we should do to correct this. <br>  <br>  This is the same for adults, children....if you think before you speak, you can say things that are not putting someone on the defensive yet you can get your point across....It's all in the wording....|`|PKULDaC7aa	Its impossible, for you to come to the conclusion that the person is lying to you that in itself is a judgement.|`|AA11987172	I think the key is in minding your own business.  Live and let live.<br>  <br>  Even if this other person is "sinning," just stay out of it and let your god take care of it...|`|n55igpCUaa	I am an atheist, and therefore I don't get punished for judging =D<br>  <br>  However, I try to take it easy on labels.|`|AA10067344	Personally, I find exercising good judgment to be beneficial.

I went to a beautiful place, a forest, meadow ad there was a beautiful stream, but it must not have been the river of forgetfulness because I began remembering past lives more clearly and reviewing my current life before I was interrupted and had to return to this world.

I'd assume Hermes or Hekate would lead me to the Underworld, but I doubt we'd be going to the River straight off. :) I think we get a little time to rest in between lives, and wait for the rest of our "group" to join us before we take another turn.

YIAZmSW7aa	No because they'd just close their eyes during the bad parts and pretend it was something happy and glittery, similarly to when they put their fingers in their ears and go LALALALALA anytime you try to educate one on the atrocities contained within those pages.|`|176PIYNVaa	Yes.

How is that any different from what people do to one anothe?.  At least God does it out of love.  People take life for no reason but you don't seem to have a problemo with that.  You got some nerve!  BTW - all will live again, death is not the end of life.|`|gj6rpPjYaa	Yes; and even now, there are so many christians in name only. Very few are practicing christians.

This is mainly due to the fact that Catholics interpret only parts of the Bible.|`|frFCT3H7aa	I feel that there are questions in your mind regarding the differences between what the Bible preaches and christian practices! And in fact your question is quite valid. I will give just passing references from Bible to think about:<br>  <br>  1) Jesus went to mountain to worship! Who is he worshiping if he himself is God?<br>  <br>  2) Devil raises Jesus very high in sky, shows him all the kingdoms of earth and says if Jesus obeys him all kingdoms will be given to Jesus!<br>  Can Devil say this to God?<br>  <br>  3) Jesus comes to his disciples and asks them for food; they give him fish and honey! Does God requires sustenance?<br>  <br>  4) Jesus on cross cries out: "Eli Eli la ma sabachtani" (O God! O God! Why have you forsaken me?)! Can these words be said by God?<br>  <br>  5) When Jesus returns after being crucified (as per Bible), his disciples are astonished and are in a state of disbelief! Did his disciples considered him to be God? If so then why were they amazed when he came back?<br>  <br>  6) Does God dies? If not then how can he be crucified?<br>  <br>  Does not all this indicate that there is something which has gone wrong after Jesus Christ (may peace and blessings be upon him) left?<br>  Is it not that the original message preached by Jesus is not same as that preached by Church today? If so then where is the original message? <br>  <br>  Can we find the original message of Christ, The True Message?<br>  Answer is YES<br>  <br>  This is true message of Christ:<br>  <br>  "He (Jesus) said: Verily! I am a slave of God, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet; <br>  <br>  And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me prayer, and charity, as long as I live. <br>  <br>  And made me dutiful to my mother (Mary), and not arrogant nor unblest.<br>  <br>  And peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!<br>  <br>  Such is 'Jesus, son of Mary'. This is a statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute). <br>  <br>  It befits not (the Majesty of) God Almighty, that He should beget a son [i.e saying that Jesus is the son of Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted be God above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, "Be!" and it is. <br>  <br>  Jesus said: "And verily God is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (Alone). That is the Straight Path. (God's Religion of Islamic Monotheism which He did ordain for all of His Prophets)." <br>  (Qur'an 19:30-36)|`|qSHO1wQtaa	I am betting there would be.  Although, reading the bible AND intelligently thinking about the statements therein would be required.|`|ryOti9v0aa	Well, IF they actually OBEYED the Bible...<br>  <br>  Yes.|`|GchuqcCaaa	If christians critically read the bible they would certainly think it is a crappy book.|`|79f5a220cbaeaee23f7053e20846799faa	For cryin' out loud (LMAO!), don't encourage 'em.  ... There's enough thumpin' and humpin' going on already, without you calling for comprehension too.<br>  <br>  .|`|s1zitZMOaa	I think if they sat down and read it starting at the beginning instead of skipping around, yes, a lot of them would realize just how ridiculous and outlandish the whole thing reads. <br>  <br>  My mother has said several times (this is a conversation we've had many times) that she thinks most people are adults by the time they get around to reading the whole bible and when they do they are so embarrassed by how what the bible actually says vs. what they've taught all their life they just put it down and pretend it didn't say those ridiculous things. So if factor in those types of reactions (and I think that's a valid point) then perhaps not so many.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	This know also, that IN THE LAST DAYS perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

Christians read the bible dutifully all day long and seek understanding of what they read.  Of course that doesn't mean the Christian comprehends what they are reading, but some imagine they do. <br>  <br>  A lot of it is selective reading. Read what enforces what you believe and ignore the rest. Gloss over what is not understood and embrace the familiar. Deny the obvious contradictions and explain away any negative verses.|`|AA11521494	maybaby isn't right - catholics ARE encouraged to read the bible these days.  What is more apparent is the way Christians tie themselves into mental knots to explain away the inconvenient bits of the bible when it is perfectly clear what they say.  That is, if they have actually read all of it.  I did and it really doesn't make sense.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Hmmm yeah and understood the time place and people that wrote it for the disciples a hundred years after Jesus' life.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Maybe.

Evolution is easily falsifiable, ex. rabbit in the Cambrian.  ID cannot be falsified.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	In my opinion Intelligent Design has very little to do with science.  It has everything to do with dressing up Creationism in "Scientificy" clothing in an attempt to smuggle it in to a secular education system.  <br>  <br>  The problem is that anyone can propose a hypothesis.  For example I can hypothesize the Sun is filled with a rich dark chocolate center.  However, if the hypothesis is untestable, then it is not scientific.  In that sense I am actually for having Intelligent Design taught in schools.  It will show people what an example of what a complex yet a flawed untestable hypothesis looks like so they can avoid making the same mistake in their scientific endeavors in the future.  <br>  <br>  I also think that evolutionary theory should be taught in any church that supports Intelligent Design.  If they want to use science, then they should be shown a working tested theory on which to base their next attempt.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|macZI2dzaa	Your logic is faulty.  The existence of the wedge document neither confirms nor denies the validity of ID.  It may or may not bring suspicion upon those that wrote the document only.  <br>  ID is real.  It is so basic, an elementary school student can grasp it.  Those that cannot grasp it and acknowledge that it is a legitimate alternative are prejudice against any possible alternative to Darwinism.  <br>  Truth is Darwinism is not falsifiabe.  When geologic or other data conflicts with Darwinism it is dismissed as an anomaly, and ignored.  Darwinism is not science although it is the monolithic view of many.  <br>  Darwinism is the creation myth of the 20th century.

2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	Who needs proof?  She lays in a grave and awaits the resurrection.  There is nothing Holy about her.  She was handpicked by God for a specific purpose.  Jesus said, “No one has ascended to heaven but He who has come down from heaven” (John 3:13)  So where does Mary fit in this if Jesus own words say no man has ascended to heaven but himself?|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Paul obviously either hated, mistrusted, or feared women. His ignoring of the two most important women in your god's life is evidence of that hate or fear. His writings are full of vitriol spewed toward women. He is more hateful of them then he is of those of us who will not or cannot believe in the religion that he marketed.|`|AA11364538	what does it matter?  why would he speak of mary?  are you trying to prove a point of some type?  paul doesn't speak of mary because there is no need to speak of mary.|`|7CWwd8H2aa	He never mentions the Pyramids in Egypt, either, is that proof they weren't there? Oh, wait, they were.|`|Blajij6iaa	You throw that word "proof" around pretty carelessly.|`|qPzxKhrlaa	Why on earth would it even matter? He didn't speak of Fred the Plumber either.|`|ybFg4umCaa	Could be that she didn't exist|`|zRyI5CMGaa	No it's not proof!.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Well, my mom's dead & still talk about her so I don't think that would preclude him from mentioning her.  Since all the Epistolary accounts are different, I'm guessing each wrote about things from the perspective they were trying to communicate.  Perhaps Paul felt no need to mention Mary.  Just like Luke, being a doctor, felt the need for more analytical writing than the other 3 gospel accounts.  But I like your question b/c it never occurred to me that he failed to mention her.|`|664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	I am not sure what your point is, but I am sure Paul did not write about a lot of people that were living at the time he wrote.<br>  <br>  Unlike the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) which were written specifically about Jesus & His teachings, Paul's writings (letters) were concerned with Christian living, BASED on the teachings of Jesus & what Paul received from the Holy Spirit to write.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  Figure it out.|`|0986bc76a0c64849cd314d95d205ad54aa	Bad logic dude.<br>  <br>  Paul did not speak of many people in his writings, does that mean they were dead.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Maybe he just didn't like her that much...|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	Wow.  Excellent logic.  He also didn't speak of Caesar Augustus.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Not necessarily, but she may have been.  What's your point?|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Probably..|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Um...no. <br>  Maybe he just didn't feel like talking about her.<br>  Why would it matter whether she was dead or alive at the time anyway?|`|o4UrRbTvaa	Jesus was already dead too.  But that didn't stop Paul from writing about him.|`|AA10067344	No.

It provides the means of superceding and subduing the flesh.  In heaven there will be no sin because all the causes of sin - the world, the flesh and the devil - will be eliminated.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Nobody cares that you don't believe in the Christianity aspect of Heaven. There is no sin in heaven because God dwells there and cannot tolerate sin at all. Humans only received 'free will' because they disobeyed God at the beginning of creation by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Nobody knows if we get to keep our free will after we die.

kPOUBBSQaa	The sentence structure sure is similar. <br>  For example, in the Korean language, the direct object is put in the beginning of the sentence.<br>  <br>  Turkish is also the same: Kitabi aliyorum = I am taking the book.<br>  O kizi g?riyorum = I can see that girl.<br>  <br>  The Turkish word for tea is ?ay, Korean = cha ?<br>  The Turkish words for 'don't go' is: ka?ma<br>  Korean = kajima ???<br>  <br>  The 'ma' behind a word gives the meaning of not to do something...<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you!|`|ScR5xUM4aa	That's what is controversially called the "Altaic family". <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_lang...</a><br>  <br>  It's very debated because the similarities are called too weak to be true, specially for Japanese and Korean.|`|9IrdMFX7aa	When I studied Japanese at university, I had a fellow student from Turkey. He said that Japanese and the Turkish language is very similar.|`|P5AgKF9Yaa	No. japanese has no connection to turkic languages or korean.|`|015UIOXlaa	I think Japanese and Korean got a lot of language influence from China.  And I suppose it's not impossible that China got some influence from Turkey via the Silk Road.  But even the grammar between Chinese and Japanese and Korean is so different, it's hard to figure that what you suggest, really is the case.|`|TaIQHuV2aa	yes, it is true they are connected in many wayz there languages|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Japanese and Korean are supposedly language isolates (distantly related to each other) but it's also debated that they could be part of the Altaic family (which is where the Turkish part is from). There are grammatical ties, but it's still debated.<br>  <br>  Many people think they're related to Chinese, which they're not. I say that they're pretty much isolates, with distant ties to Turkish and stuff.|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	You'll probably get a lot more useful information by consulting academic works. Vowel harmony in archaic Japanese is one telling feature. It's such an unusual characteristic that it has to be either a genetic or a Sprachbund feature. Since it was lost, I would think that points more to a genetic link as Japanese clearly hasn't been in the Altaic Sprachbund sphere of influence in historical times. You could argue that the continental Yayoi were speakers of a non-genetically Altaic language in an Altaic-dominated Sprachbund, but I'm not sure how you'd tell the difference. If a language is so deeply tied to a Sprachbund that it borrows a feature as pervasive and morphologically significant as vowel harmony, the line between borrowing and replacement is pretty thin. I personally think that the idea of genetic language relationships is overrated, and that at some point there isn't really any fundamental difference between extensive borrowing and genetic inheritance in languages. Japanese has and historically had Altaic features, so however it got them, it's at least partially Altaic.<br>  <br>  Viz. inter alia <a href="http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/japanese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling4...</a>

Most are 4 sessions with an 8 minute video and discussion / leader's guides. These cost about $28US each, but divided out per session it isn't that much.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you talk to others who are already leading groups and get their input. Topics should be catered to the needs of your group, so, without knowing the group it is difficult to give you any meaningful guidance in that area.<br>  ======================================<br>  <br>  <br>  Co-ed young adult...

They have home study guides on various topics that will make you task easy as someone else has already done the work for you|`|gj18ySAWaa	I would start at the beginging of Genisis and have a study on how everything started, after that it doesn't mean you have to go in order with the books, but start off in the beginning, or look up the topical indexes in the back & follow scripture that way. Depending on what the group is couples,men,women, youth,  ask the people what they also think and work together.|`|AA10198840	If this is a group thing, perhaps you should get together and pray about it. The Holy Spirit has a way of leading into our needs. Go for the general topics that are brought up while the group is sharing and praying... delve into the areas that come up during group conversation.<br>  <br>  Pray that the Spirit will give your group insight, wisdom and knowledge as you research these topics in the Bible and other sources, and as you each share what you find as a group.<br>  <br>  I have been involved with home groups for years. The closeness and sharing with others in your community simply can not be found in a larger church setting. The worshiping, sharing a meal with one another and other group activities... and caring together about others outside the group... these people become like an extended family and support network. This is more in line with what the early church was all about. Sure beats just being a quiet member of a mega-church.<br>  <br>  I agree that discipleship is a great topic. I've also used an book and study guide by Bob George called "Classic Christianity" which is a great guide to find out who we are in Christ. Simple, straightforward and a good starting point. Just a study of Romans will keep you in discussions for awhile. You can obtain guides at a Bible book store.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Here's a great idea:  Teach all the verses of the Bible, one chapter at a time, and eventually you get to teach the whole Bible, as Paul said to do in Acts.  <br>  <br>  Here's a website that teaches the meaning of every verse of every Book in the Bible:  <a href="http://www.soniclight.com/constable/notes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.soniclight.com/constable/note...</a><br>  <br>  Start in Romans, and go a chapter a week, and then do the next Book, and the next, in that pattern, when you're done with Revelation, start in Genesis.

Un hombre es fundamentalmente su mente|`|yzL8hPN2aa	Hace ya algunos a?os que he sostenido, contra viento y marea, que la calidad de inteligente en el ser humano, solo le ha servido, en trminos generales, para su propia destruccin porque hemos aplicado la inteligencia para hacer uso de nuestro libre albedro y ste lo hemos aplicado tan solo para abusar de nosotros mismos, de nuestros semejantes y de nuestro entorno.

9b25119676cb60c00708b15f0c12ac6eaa	I believe in freedom of choice, because God gave us all free will, that's why he create all of us with our own brains so we can think for ourselves. Sometime I have to remind myself that, because I can be really bossy sometimes.|`|pfke6Jieaa	i always look at both sides of the road. i never look only one way. when ppl argue or disagree with me i look at their point of view as well. i dont have to have every single person completely agree with me or completely disagree. but there are quite a few ppl that its either their way or no way. that attitude screams arrogance.|`|5sP8ZO76aa	I let people have their freedom of choice put it doesn't mean i agree with them if i believe if something is right then i will argue my case but if someone made a good point then i would go with it|`|u8C7GNLcaa	I think you should acknowledge other's|`|Bcy79VGXaa	No, I appreciate that others are entitled to there say and to express their own views and way of thinking and understanding things. And that if their expressing an opinion there is no right or wrong.<br>  <br>  But sometimes it's a nice feeling when you find out your choice/s are the more suitable and correct ones!:D|`|aQVQUgIaaa	Depends what your talking about, but just because you think you are 100% right, doesn't mean you can't respect the other person's right to choose for themselves. <br>  If it's something that affects you in a big way, compromise is the way.|`|09NY2BMKaa	With regards to what? in general i think people are set in their ways. I think if people see something different than what they are used to, they assume it is odd or wrong.|`|AA10106002	I'm glad people in the U.S. have freedom of choice, but my way is right.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	My way is the right way for me.  Other people can do what they want as long as they don't interfere with what I am doing.
ryOti9v0aa	I know...<br>  <br>  IF I believed in Heaven, I'd already be there, via Seppuku!<br>  <br>  T o Hades with this miserable, "PC" world!|`|CnqGu1Taaa	no,that is the destroyer the Satan............God is a savior|`|kkSyz6aoaa	Yes, now go to Clearwater, Florida and drink from the Church of Scientologys Kool-aid XD|`|AA11992885	yes and no.........one must understand, the whisper of "return to me" does NOT say "violently kill yourself"...............ascension, the Buddhist concept most closely speaks of it......to ascend beyond the physical body, and return........but to violently take one's life, this intales destruction, destruction is not good|`|89MKzLl3aa	What this means is that the person has lost all hope. God wants all to receive life and to nurture it as well as to give it and help those in need.|`|cdd57d1b18b8d82168928705079633ecaa	No-God loves us but not our sins. satan and his demons attack God's creation(US) because we are made in God's image. Didn't you know that this Earth we live on is satan's playground? he plays a deadly game and we are his targets. Our only protection is by turning to and accepting Jesus Christ.|`|AA12194228	No!|`|PWankIUpaa	NO!  Most emphatically NO!<br>  <br>  Suicide is a Sin against God ! If these thoughts are coming into some one's mind then be sure it is NOT of God! <br>  He has said      Thou Shalt NOT Kill !<br>  <br>  To go along with this He said that some one who lies are the same as a murderer! <br>  <br>  You need God ! Satin is out to destroy God's Creation ! YOU!  He wants you to die in your sins and be lost forever!  He takes Comfort in the fact that he has caused yet another soul to be lost forever from God! <br>  Ezekiel 32:17, 25-31<br>  <br>  Don't give the Hater of your soul comfort by allowing him to blind you to salvation! <br>  <br>  God Loves you ! Depression is a spirit and you can be free from this Demonic influence! Give your life to God! Ask Him to over come this evil spirit !|`|a4CJYsH9aa	God is not the God of suicide.<br>  God is the "giver" of life, life more abundant. John 10:10<br>  It's the "enemy" that desires to steal, kill and destroy you, not God.<br>  Your biggest enemy is the deceiver the Devil..<br>  <br>  God is a good God, not evil, so if you are hearing voices that suggest you cut your life short, you can believe it's coming from out of the darkness to deceive you into  making your way into the pit of hell.<br>  It is a sin to take your own life, it's called murder.<br>  One of the 10 commadments is Thou Shalt not KILL....<br>  <br>  If you are joking about this and you think it's funny to joke about<br>  suicide, then you certainly need help.<br>  Because if you send yourself to hell because of suicide, your whole life was in vain and there was no point of you being born.<br>  If you are depressed there is medical help out there.<br>  <br>  Shirlely|`|gj6rpPjYaa	No, that is not right. God has a purpose for everyone he created on earth. It is his desire that we all achieve the purpose. Suicide is always the cheap and cowardly way out. Suicide is a foolish way to chicken out of God's plan.|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	i dont think it is God. i think it is the devil. but that is my opionion. idk what other people think. but i personanlly think it is the devil whispering in ur ear telling you to give up all hope, and to not wittness to people. but that is just what i think. ide ask a preacher if i was you|`|19PgkkFWaa	LOL to rowan's comment and are you that stupid and blind that you think that people who have severe depression who want to kill themselves is actually a whisper from god? holy science!! you know its people like you that makes me hate christians thats a disgusting thing to say. what so those poor people have to suffer till your fake magical sky fairy tells us to kill ourselves? god this is so wrong someone delete this question please|`|bEQe1bNmaa	No, it means you want to get some proper help, and fast.|`|nwdwKnS7aa	If God was whispering to me I'd want to kill myself too.
2AkngfXwaa	No that is not necessarily true. Though there is an increase. This has been done for centuries in other country's. <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss" rel="nofollow">http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/fea...</a> It is mainly the US that has an aversion to this. There are many countries to this day that still do this. It is against the law in about 35 states but even in those states double first cousin marriages are not allowed for instance both parents siblings to the other parents. There are two different views among scientist about this. <a href="http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/cousin33.html" rel="nofollow">http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/cousin3...</a>   <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/331/7528/1292" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/331/7528...</a>|`|f7bcycfgaa	why? are planning on it?<br>  ummmm............ i've heard that too... idk though|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	25 or so states allow first cousin to marry.  The chance of cousins having a 'messed up' child are far less than that with a parent/chiils or brother/sister case of incest.<br>  <br>  Statisitcally iti s a little higher than for non-realted people.<br>  <br>  From 2nd cousin on there is no greater risk at all.|`|xv8CjbXEaa	Yes, I have heard that. It has something to do with the genes and stuff like that. <br>  I wouldn't advise you do that. <br>  I could cause problems for the child and it is gross.|`|OaG81wkPaa	Yes is true , it's about 75% sure that the kid comes messed up out.
Rj34Cur3aa	the concept of god, definitely.  the whole "soul" thing i don't buy either, but its not as far fetched a theory made by people who don't understand how the brain works.  (not that we do completely yet, but i can see how people long ago decided that there was a "soul" because they didn't.)<br>  <br>  <br>  for example...if i were more gullible and less interested in the truth, it would be easier to buy the theory that our inner "self" was some intangible thing that resided in us until death than it would for me to accept the story of a zombie jesus, talking burning bushes, etc.|`|vVka4ZA0aa	Concept of God. I simply don't believe that there is a person-like entity hanging out in a cosmic heaven-like place watching everything that we do and judging us. Also, the idea of God came from people YEARS ago and the bible has too much contradictions and interpretations. <br>  A soul doesn't necessarily mean a god, it just indicates something to the effect of energy. Like each creature has within them energy, energy =soul...<br>  My problem with religion is that each religion stems from another religion and was ultimately created because someone or people didn't like the base religion, so they changed what they didn't like about it, and created a new religion.|`|ryOti9v0aa	Actually, they are BOTH mutually incomprehensible to me.|`|o0BdXbwpaa	They're supposed to be incomprehensible. They're not ideas but living truths. Once you start living them then they're no longer a problem.|`|kyeYqqVfaa	I can grasp the concept of both easily. But that doesn't validate the existance of them either.|`|tccazVZ8aa	They're pretty much on par with one another.|`|kkSyz6aoaa	I find both to be as unreasonable, since they both need each other.|`|wwdllMzYaa	concept of a god, especially of the religious desciription<br>  beause its unrealsitic, illogical, implausible and has no evidence what so eer to back it up or evne support it in simple theory<br>  <br>  souls i beleive to be possible, because, they DO stand up to logic, possiblity, plausibility, and i think maybe the evidence is in the things about oru biology that we cant explain, i cant say it is for sure, but, i think its possible|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	The concept of soul.  The soul is so poorly defined that I can't get a grasp on what it's even supposed to be referring to, and people who believe in souls don't seem to have a very concrete idea of what it is, either.  At least people who believe in god have a pretty firm handle on what they think god is.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	They're both comprehensible to me, in that I accept the idea that either one or both may exist.  Do I understand them?  Not a chance, but I'm open to new ideas :-)|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	My conception of both requires they be the same thing.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	All things are possible.
MSHxYrLEaa	heeeeey, thats not nice, just coz we have red busses :p|`|wwdllMzYaa	what?<br>  dont you man why does every country treat people liek dogs in the past, and some now?<br>  why pick our britain from teh many hundreds of countries?|`|M3sVQm2Maa	That's what happens when you think god chose you to rule over other people.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Generalize much?....<br>  The British Empire was resource and power hungry and took over 3/4 of the globe, mostly by peaceful means and tact but if they couldnt get a foothold in the country they would send missionaries first to soften people up and gain alliances.<br>  <br>  The Germans, Dutch, Spanish and French also exploited foreign countries and some were more brutal than the British.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	The English did it for England and the King.|`|4qj98nhdaa	They did it in the name of christianity.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	The church told them to do it, it is god's way or the highway......|`|bEQe1bNmaa	Not just British people, we were actually quite tolerant compared to many nations and still are.
D4jZM26Paa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Robertson_controversies" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Roberts...</a> - This.|`|AA11923447	"Good Christian moral values" do not include spreading lies and hatred. This is the man who said that gay people caused Hurricane Katrina. He said that the Episcopal Church contains the "spirit of the Antichrist". He called for the assassination of Hugo Chavez. He has also made false prophecies, such as saying that God would judge the world in 1982, and that there would be a massive terrorist attack on the United States in 2007. I'm a Christian, and I have no use for him.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	I think he is an ignorant jerk.  I don't know if that means I hate him.  Hate is an emotion... and I don't feel hate when I think of P.R.<br>  <br>  I just think... he is an ignorant jerk.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	who hates Pat...give me names ..give me names  :)|`|nhGIZE71aa	Maybe the fact that he agreed with Jerry Falwell when he said that liberals, gays and abortionists were responsible for 9/11.  Maybe the fact that he frequently calls Hinduism a religion of demons.  The fact that he shunned the residents of Dover, PA when they voted out the creationists from their school board and told them not to call upon god when they experienced a catastrophe, because they had just rejected god from their town.  And the list goes on.  He is nothing but a hate-filled bigot, and he should be treated as one.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	All I know of Pat Robertson is that is hates Hugo Chavez and wants him ASSASSINATED ASAP...!!!|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	I don't hate Pat Robertson. I simply believe he is an opportunist who has made millions of dollars by convincing people like you that he speaks for God.|`|ItjUfDplaa	Just a few of the many reasons why people may hate him...<br>  <br>  1. He agreed with a fellow televangelist when he said that pagans, abortionists, feminists, gays, lesbians, the American Civil Liberties Union and the People For the American Way caused 9/11, which was punishment from God for America being a sinful nation full of homosexuals and liberals.<br>  <br>  2. He thinks gay people are the cause of earthquakes and hurricanes.<br>  <br>  3. He has suggested, several times, that Washington DC should be nuked.<br>  <br>  4. According to him, the people who live in the city of Dover, Pennsylvania,are wicked people who will all go to hell ... because they voted for local school board members who support evolution teaching over creation in their county school board.<br>  <br>  5. Did I mention that he hates gay people?|`|KILFoc6kaa	I dont believe God hates America.  God may hate some of the things that happen in america, and all over the world, but remember God Loves the Sinner and hates the Sin.<br>  <br>  As far as Pat Robertson, I have no feelings towards him either way, because I have never bothered to actually listen to him.|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	I don't know the guy. From the mentions he got in Y!A, though, it seems to me that Pat Robertson hates a lot more people than the people who hate Pat Robertson, and from your description of him I realize that is true.<br>  Pat Robertson probably hates: non-christians, liberals, socialists, democrats, blacks, mexicans, immigrants, foreigners, arabs, gay & lesbians and all those who support them.<br>  Seems like he hates a lot of people, don't you think? That's about 90% of the US population! :-)|`|spbqfjvbaa	Sure, he's a good Christian man who is splitting this country apart.  He uses God's word to make the US into 2 categories:  everyone who is with him, & the sinners (those who don't believe how he believes).  <br>  <br>  He was the same man who said that God brought 9/11 to the US because of how this country treats the gays.  Our God in a benevolent, loving God.  He is making everything he believes into a "your with us or against us" crusade.  As a member of the military & a Christian, it just shows that he wants to divide this country & have us hate our fellow man.  <br>  <br>  Last time I checked, it is the PERSON, not their sexual orientation, that affects their personality, character, integrity, work ethic, & how they treat their fellow man.  I would LOVE to have the 2nd coming happen so people like this would no longer have to interpret/twist the Word of God to their own warped beliefs.|`|UxooffHZaa	yeah, he's a 'good Christian' but he hates everyone that's not him, and said he wants to "blow up" and "assassinate" people he disagrees with. (his words, not mine) People don't tend to like that.|`|vL8JErXNaa	Because he's a sexist, homophobic asshat|`|dmCAiuMGaa	You just answered your own question in the details.  Sad, but true.|`|URO3gDXcaa	hahahaha!!  read up a little on him and you will find out.|`|7hpXsYOCaa	I don't hate  him, that man gives me the creep.|`|2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	Personally, I don't hate anyone but we are talking about a man that hides behind God and takes money from people and use it for his own selfish purpose, right?  Well, enough said!  It doesn't look good when a man claiming to represent God is living high off the hog while others are going without.  Men like him don't know the true God and are really ministers of the devil.  To be fair, he isn't the only one - look at Joel Olsteen, Creflo Dollar and many others.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	He's a televangelist.<br>  <br>  Like it or not, there is a stigma with that label, as most televangelists seem to be more preoccupied with appearance, and money, than they do with actually spreading the gospels.<br>  <br>  He also tried to grab power, by trying to run for political office. He failed in that bid.<br>  <br>  He also keeps making doomsday predictions, that NEVER come to pass. <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  "On the January 2, 2007 broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson said that God spoke to him and told him that "mass killings" were to come during 2007, due to a terrorist attack on the United States. He added, "The Lord didn't say nuclear. But I do believe it will be something like that."<br>  <br>  I'm tired of religious fanatics, no matter what the religion, constantly trying to add more to their fold, or keep them, by using fear.<br>  <br>  Why is it that all those who claim to see the future ALWAYS seem to predict terrible things? No one ever comes forth saying anything good awaits us in the future.<br>  <br>  He desires nothing but power and wealth, and will use fear to get both. <br>  <br>  Shameful.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Oh and I don't waste my time and energy on hating him. I just don't pay much if any attention to him at all.<br>  <br>  Remember, the opposite of love isn't hate. It's indifference.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I guess that you don't listen to the hate and evilness that spews from his mouth! The worst, however, is the fact that he wishes to control what the rest of us see, read, believe, and worship. What could possibly be more evil than that.<br>  <br>  God does not exist, and even if he (she, it, or they) did he would abhor the thought of such people as Robertson.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	He says a lot of goofy stuff, and has spoken many false prophecies that never happened. <br>  <br>  Personally I think he is controlled opposition, which is why I refuse to listen to him.|`|GGGmoyNeaa	I'd expect you to like him,you are just as if not more ignorant as him,If you love him that much why don't you go off and suck his c ock? It might stop you spouting hateful nonsense.|`|7K2HVodhaa	Pat Robertson doesn't have good morals. He may have Christian morals, and therefore by definition, NOT good morals.|`|jAPBNtMKaa	For me its because he has twice advocated the detonation of nuclear bombs in Washington DC. Since members of my family live there, he essentially wanted to kill them.<br>  <br>  That's enough to make my you know what list.|`|dDprsKZYaa	Because he's a raving psychopath that should be behind bars, mainly.|`|AA11503457	The mainstream media have labeled him as double-plus-ungood, and their viewers are acting accordingly.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Really?  Good Christian moral values teach you to hate homosexuals?  Or atheists?  Or people different than your religion?  <br>  <br>  Well, yeah I guess the bible does say that but Jesus never never did.|`|kEWknILEaa	Because Pat Robertson hated a lot of people, first.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	I thought god was love|`|G2tnn5yjaa	It could be because he's a hatemongering hypocrite, but that's just a guess on my part. Why do you think it is?|`|Tj0A8f8Taa	Who the heck is Pat Robertson?|`|5dfvRSumaa	"Hes a man with good Christian moral values and he doesnt put up with this left wing BS thats destroying our nation and causing God to hate America."<br>  I think you just answered your own question...
47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	Everybody is "the real Christian", even Fred Phelps. According to him, he and his gang are the only Christians. It's not conceivable to most people that they could even possibly or remotely be wrong. It's not quite fair to pick on them alone though, as Muslims and many others  are just as incapable of seeing themselves objectively. This does not apply only to religion.<br>  <br>  I've been reading a book called "Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me)" about how we as humans justify our beliefs. Its scary and its embarrassing when you see yourself in its stories!|`|hVVALFAPaa	Christians believe in Christ.<br>  <br>  If you believe in Christ, you are a 'real' Christian. It doesn't mean you necessarily act like what others believe Christians are supposed to act.<br>  <br>  Putting aside whether you believe in Christ... <br>  --if you believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, then you are a 'real' FSMian. <br>  --if you believe in Satan, you are a 'real' Satanian (?)<br>  --if you believe in tree spirits......|`|zRyI5CMGaa	I agree with you on this question, in my experience I have had is that people who believe they are the 'True Christians' gave themselves that badge and so did some of the rhetoric from the pulpits of their Church's. Conveniently forgetting some of Jesus message such as 'judge lest ye shall be judged'.|`|gj6rpPjYaa	A real christian is one who believes in Christ and does what Christ says. Obedience to all of God's commands is christianity.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Some who claim to be true christians attack other Christians and call them pagans.|`|500b0fe5bfd90198931c2235e47b33efaa	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.<br>  -Romans 8:14|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Faith is based on Jesus statements. Emotions are irrelevant.|`|0XR15Dbuaa	Elvis appeared to me in a vision and told me I was one.  :)|`|azazvgxIaa	To answer your question, I believe that anyone that accepts Jesus their Lord and Savior is a "real" Christian.  As for those that go around and claim they are superior to any other Christian sect I can not answer, since I do not claim to be the only "real" Christian.  I, personally, believe that it is simply a case of one person branching off, beginning their sect, and in an attempt to gain members and prevent them from leaving they possess a need to take the stand of being the only the true path to God.  <br>  <br>  Peace in Christ|`|pSfW0ROmaa	I can't explain it. That's why it's called the peace that passeth understanding. You can have it too. It's not just based on emotions but on Biblical truths and other evidence (like the way my life has changed).

Their cheapness rivals that of the stereotypical Jew. They don't seem to understand capitalism. You cannot expect to walk into a retail store an then try to haggle. If I ever hear the the phrases "How much for me?", "How much if I buy today?" or "No, no, that is far too costly." It will be too soon. I even had a Indian roommate at a military boarding school, he was quite annoying, His family was so cheap that they rarely came to visit on account that they didn't want to put extra miles on their car because it would hurt the resale value (Keep in mind the round trip from the school to where they lived was a whopping 120 miles.) When I sold cars nobody would want to deal with Indian customers because they would piss and moan about the price of everything and want to negotiate for hours, only to leave when the sales manager of the dealership would have enough and give them an ultimatum. <br>  <br>  With that said the younger Indians that were born in the U.S. and have been indoctrinated with what the public expects of them are much easier to deal with, most of them know what is socially acceptable and what is not.|`|npA75Obvaa	Republicans, because I've never met one that cared about anybody or anything that didn't have to do with their wallets.|`|y3eY9x0kaa	You thats little answer you left on my last question was disturbing. wierdo.|`|AA10106002	Ben Laden, he started this world wide mess.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern.

IFQFt25naa	The best biblical example I can think of that indicates that the people who have passed away still have memories of what happened here is: Luke16:19-31<br>  <br>  In this case it was a person asking that someone be sent to his family that is still living so that they will not suffer the same fate.  Which would indicate that the people that have passed on do have a memory of the people that are still on this earth.<br>  <br>  Ultimately we don’t know what happens to us once we get to the other side.   While I am not going to list all the sections of verses where the dead are speaking about something or trying to warn us of something, I find it difficult to believe that one could biblically show that our soul “forgets” everything especially after Jesus Our Lord and Savior came.<br>  <br>  For what it is worth I am sorry that you lost your aunt.  But I do believe that she is able to remember you and perhaps even watch/visit you from time to time.  Someday (hopefully many many years from now) when it is your time to pass, I think the two of you will see each other again, as well as other friends and family.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	Memories are created through trillions of synapses in your brain,   these synapses are formed from neurons, which upon death start to decay.  The neurons are positioned in such a way together that their physical placement is what is responsible for your memories.<br>  <br>  Memories are very material dependent, without the neurons there would be no memories.  So yes, after biological death there are no longer any memories, as the medium to store them has been destroyed.   Just as if you were to destroy a record album, the contents would have likewise been destroyed.  Unless you have a backup of your brain somewhere, which is not possible in this day,  they are gone.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	Yes, it is true. When we die, we forget everything.<br>  <br>  You aunt, who died, has no idea who you are, because she is dead, she is not conscious at all. It is not like she is wandering around somewhere, and sees you here on earth but just does not remember who you are. She is dead; she is unconscious. She cannot see you. She is buried and awaits the resurrection just like everyone who has died.<br>  <br>  In other words, the dead are truly dead.<br>  <br>  But she will know who you are once she is alive again. If she was saved, she will be raised at the resurrection of life which is at the Christ's second coming.<br>  <br>  It is written in God's Holy Word:<br>  <br>  Psalm 6:5 - For in death there is no remembrance of You;  In the grave who will give You thanks?<br>  <br>  Psalm 115:17 - The dead do not praise the LORD, Nor any who go down into silence.<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5<br>        For the living know that they will die;<br>        But the dead know nothing,<br>        And they have no more reward,<br>        For the memory of them is forgotten.<br>  <br>  <br>  "So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep." "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, BUT HE  PERCEIVETH IT NOT OF THEM." Job 14:12, 21<br>  <br>  His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. - Psalm 146:4<br>  <br>  <br>  The dead await in the grave for the call of their Lord (we do not go to heaven upon death):<br>  <br>  "All that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth." John 5:28, 29. "David ... is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day." "For David is not ascended into the heavens." Acts 2:29, 34. "If I wait, the grave is mine house." Job 17:13.<br>  <br>  <br>  We receive eternal life at the second coming:<br>  <br>  "Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be." Revelation 22:12. "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, ... and the dead in Christ shall rise ... and so shall we ever be with the Lord." 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17. "We shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, ... and the dead shall be raised incorruptible. ... For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality." 1 Corinthians 15:51-53.<br>  <br>  After the resurrection of life, God's people will never die again:<br>  <br>  "They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, ... Neither can they die any more." Luke 20:35, 36. "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away." Revelation 21:4.|`|n7mVqA3Raa	Ecclesiastes 3:11 & 15 says.......<br>  God has made everything beautiful in it's time. Also He has put eternity in our hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end.<br>  That which has already been, and what is to be has already been; and God requires an account of what is past.<br>  verse 21(a) says<br>  Who knows the spirit of the sons/daughter's of men, which goes upward<br>  <br>  God is going to bring those that did not except His Son Jesus into judgment after we've died and are raised to life again to eternal damnation (separated from God). In Matthew 24 Jesus taught that there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth because all their sins will be brought up and they won't be able to pay for them because they missed the chance here on earth when they were alive to receive  salvation. <br>  <br>  So yes I believe that we will remember. Those that excepted Jesus as their Savior now to cover their sins with His blood, and then die will be caught in the air to be with the Lord on the day of resurrection and will miss judgment.

We ARE the Universe. Our thoughts and memories are the Universe trying to understand and get to know itself. If you let your memories die with your body, the Universe will forget them. What you need to do is share your memories with others, and hope they share them too. In that way, they will remain within you, because you are the Universe.|`|6AMq1mhTaa	There is no proof at all that there is life at all after death. <br>  If there is... then it's very unlikely that are subconscious minds will even be intact at all. <br>  Everything when it ceases to exist the energy does keep going but it changes to something else<br>  The fact that someone could possibly believe that our  subconscious will stay in tact after a drastic transformation like that... is just fairy tale none sence, and very improbable<br>  And your Aunt who died probably doesn't even exist at all anymore.|`|2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	First of all, when you die, the body returns to dust from which it came and the life spirit in man returns to God since he is the one that gave it to us.

The 'good times' in any relationship are easy, it's the 'difficult times' where we invest of ourselves and our time and that's what makes the relationship 'worthwhile'.  It seems the 'key' to any relationship, whether it be a friendship...or...committed, is COMMUNICATION...and, it doesn't 'just happen'.  It takes caring, commitment, LOVE and LOTS of hard work.  Provided the two people in the relationship LOVE each other completely, try this...ALWAYS think of the other person ALL of the time...that way you're ALWAYS thinking of them and they're ALWAYS thinking of you...watching each others behinds, so to speak...  But, sadly, if anyone thinks relationships are all sweet and rosy...I'd suggest they take off their 'rose colored glasses' and grab a whiff of 'reality'.|`|AA12158476	Being single only makes you wonder "what if" as in a relationship, if there is trust, there shouldn't be, necessarily be,any stress.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	Relationships are like parties...<br>  <br>  Those who are not in the party, are always wondering what they're missing.

I'm 26 years old, I've had 11 relationships, of those 11, only 7 meant something to me and of those 7, only 2 are who I remain talking to to this day. As for now, only one of these guy was I truly in love with, well still am on love with him. As you get older you learn the difference between in love and liking someone and all of the grey areas in between. Examples are loving someone but not in love with someone, infatuation, crush, trust, trick, need....It just takes time, experience and trust.<br>  <br>  Yeah, it's stressful but if you look at it that way you'll never be in a good relationship. Relationships are hard work, you are taking another person who grew up differently than you, who thinks and does things differently than you and trying to find common ground with this person, a connection. You're not always going to agree with that person, you'll fight and spat but the point of the relationship is growing together learning each others' buttons and finding that resolution together.<br>  My ex and I have been through so much together and it helped us understand each other, it helped us love each other more. In our situation it wasn't the fact that we didn't love each other, it's just love wasn't enough when we tried so hard to make it work. It's complicated and it hurts and it's the best feeling in the world, that's love.<br>  If you want to stay single, that's fine but people need that intimate connections with someone, it goes beyond friendship and it's beyond meaningless sex. It's human nature, we are by nature social creatures.|`|cVewVL0Taa	Well both have their goods and bads. <br>  <br>  I'm single right now and will probably remain single because I'm just not into dealing with the drama that is associated with another person at this current time in my life. <br>  <br>  Although I do get lonely- I just have other things to focus on right now.|`|BuyzuOEjaa	You have to have the trust in a relationship.

My husband and I did not exchange wedding rings at our wedding (because we do not wear jewelry) and we have been married for over 17 yrs.   My parents have been married for 46 yrs, and they did not exchange rings, they have never worn wedding rings or any type of ring for that matter.<br>  It is a tradition that started many years ago, when men kind of "bought" their brides. Here is a little info from Wikipedia:<br>  In older times, the wedding rings did not only signify a sign of love, but were also linked to the bestowal of 'earnest money'. According to the prayer book of Edward VI: after the words 'with this ring I thee wed' follow the words 'This gold and silver I give thee', at which point the groom was supposed to hand a leather purse filled with gold and silver coins to the bride. [3]<br>  <br>  Not only in England was the wedding ring considered more connected to the exchange of valuables at the moment of the wedding than a symbol of eternal love and devotion but in most other European countries as well. Sometimes it went as far as being a conditional exchange as this German formula shows: 'I give you this ring as a sign of the marriage which has been promised between us, provided your father gives with you a marriage portion of 1000 Reichsthalers'. [3]<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

Lcifer  palavra latina, que quer dizer PORTADOR DE LUZ.    Lucis + Ferri = Luz + Portador (Aquele que carrega algo)    Satans vem do hebraico SATAN, que  verbo que significa OPOR-SE, fazer oposi??o, resistir, OPONENTE.    DIABO vem do grego DIABOLOS, que quer dizer caluniador, acusador, tentador, provocador, etc...    Pela etimologia da palavra podemos bricar com elas e declarar o seguinte:    Os evangelicos s?o os diabolos dos catlicos, e os catlicos s?o diabolos dos evanglicos, pois vivem se acusando mutuamente.    Da mesma forma que o Corinthias  SATAN do Palmeiras e VICE-VERSA, e da mesma foram o Grmio  SATAN do Internacional.    E Jesus era um Lcifer, pois PORTAVA a LUZ de Deus:    Jo?o  8:12   Ent?o Jesus tornou a falar-lhes, dizendo: Eu sou a luz do mundo; quem me segue de modo algum andar em trevas, mas ter a luz da vida.    Jo?o  9:5   Enquanto estou no mundo, sou a luz do mundo.

bf4d6ed6e4b432f59cf0635119a73f15aa	It seems to be that dieting is the new instant topic of conversation that everyone can relate to, and for some groups (notably young women) it also seems to provide endless entertainment and marketing value.<br>  Too bad it's pointless -- people just need to eat less and exercise more.  There is no trick or science to that.|`|PGKFzElxaa	I think some like to think that. But I think some people can't understand why others go on  a diet and not just do a lifestyle change. I know I get sick of hearing people say they are going on a diet. What does diet mean?  <br>  <br>  Plus I wonder what people are looking for when they tell others that they are going on a diet?<br>  Do they want encouraging words, do they want to be asked why? And be told that they don't need to. I personally think diets were the 80's and 90's. And now it is just silly!

664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	One of the historical "perfect societies" that I find most interesting is the case of Liberal, MO where George Walser started an all-atheist community in the late 1800's.<br>  <br>  You can read about it in any number of web pages.  Here is a brief overview...<br>  <a href="http://www.twoorthree.net/2007/06/liberal_mo_anot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.twoorthree.net/2007/06/libera...</a><br>  <br>  It sounded similar to the Biblical account of Sodom & Gomorrah were they also were void of God and Godly influences.  Thank God for His patience with the people of Liberal, and today it is just like any other town in America, having learned its lessons more than 100 years ago.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  Research it.  Figure it out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Additional Info:  Miss Marketing brings up another good example -- Jim Jones -- where we get the phrase "Don't drink the Kool-aid," meaning do not blindly follow something.  RESEARCH and STUDY it to determine whether it is worth following.  Thanks for the reminder.|`|LQvpt1CQaa	Just search the word Genocide and that should pull up some groups for you.<br>  <br>  Also Jim Jones was a cult leader that tried to create a perfect society by his own crazy terms. A lot of people including children died.
AA10106002	They all speak the same language, if that's what you mean.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	Yep. LOL that's funny.|`|jx9YnFV8aa	The deaf may be considered to be their own community by some, but I would imagine most deaf persons would want to be accepted by the larger community as a whole. Just because they communicate with sign language doesn't necessarily mean they are a culture unto themselves. They can still appreciate the beauty of a sun rise or enjoy a live performance. <br>    I believe it is the hearing community that stigmatizes the deaf and forces some to gather where they can feel normal amongst those who are like them. I don't think the deaf resemble a "cultural island" like a traditional ethnic region within a city because they share many or most of the same cultural  influences of the hearing. <br>    Though I am not hearing impaired or an expert, common sense says that people gather where there is commonality and where they can feel safe. Why should the deaf be cast as anything else? An example would be the actress Marlee Matlin. She has won awards for her ability to convey a character on stage and screen even though she cannot hear.<br>    Sadly, it is most often those who have all of their senses at hand who can be without sense that causes the separation of class, culture, ethnicity and what society has classified as disabled. So, my answer in most cases is no, the deaf cannot be considered as their own culture, But then, there are those who would differ.|`|46fouwFfaa	Yes, I think so. They have their own language and humour. My brother is deaf and actively participates in events that the deaf community organizes for the deaf. They have had comedy shows but they don't clap, they sort of wave their raised and open hands after a performance. He told me that the humour of the jokes deaf, signing people find funny wouldn't translate well into English and wouldn't be funny. American sign language can be considered to be a separate language from English. The grammar is different and may not make complete sense when translated directly into English. They definitely have their own culture and I think anyone who knows even a bit about deaf people and culture will agree.|`|RIdxiKbZaa	righty wrote:  "They all speak the same language, if that's what you mean."<br>  <br>  That is a stupid answer. You don't really think that Chinese sign language is the same as American sign language is the same as Russian sign language is the same as FarFarAway sign language, do you?
