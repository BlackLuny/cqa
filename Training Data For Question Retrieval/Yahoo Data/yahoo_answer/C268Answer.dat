akcGfgdcaa	LaBeouf was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Shayna (ne Saide), a dancer and ballerina turned visual artist and clothing/jewelry designer, and Jeffrey Craig LaBeouf, a Vietnam War veteran who "drifted" from job to job, working as a mime at a circus and as a rodeo clown. Shia LaBeouf's New York-born mother is Jewish and his father is a Cajun (once described by LaBeouf as a "Ragin' Cajun"). LaBeouf was raised in the Jewish religion and had a Bar Mitzvah. The name Shia is Hebrew for "gift from God", and the surname LaBeouf is a variation of "le boeuf", the French term for "the ox" or "the beef".|`|FHBpJ3qvaa	he was born in l.a.  he's mom is jewish and his dad is a canjun.|`|RPpXarDDaa	i don't know but he is really hot.

bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Eu adoro ouvir a rádio "Antena 1"!<br>  <br>  A "Antena 1" é uma das minhas rádios favoritas porque ela toca músicas de vários estilos diferentes, mas sem perder seu estilo próprio. Além disso, a "Antena 1" toca músicas de várias épocas diferentes, ao contrário da maioria das outras rádios que só tocam músicas que est?o na moda.<br>  Na "Antena 1" eu descobri vários artistas sensacionais e músicas lindas que nunca (ou raramente) tocam nas outras rádios. Por exemplo, a música "Ever the same", do Rob Thomas, é uma das minhas músicas favoritas e eu só a descobri através da "Antena 1", que toca essa música com bastante freqüência.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?so!!!!!!|`|bf594c10a5507c9cd104fd702184c60daa	ESTA RADIO é A MELHOR  COM SUA PROGRAMA??O LEVE SEM MUITO BLA BLA BLA...

bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	A vers?o original dessa música se chama "Dragostea din tei" e quem canta é o grupo romeno O-Zone.<br>  <br>  Aqui vai um link com a música pra você conferir:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kboing.com.br/script/radioonline/busca_artista.php?artista=o-zone&cat=music" rel="nofollow">http://www.kboing.com.br/script/radioonl...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!
bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Eu sou f? da rádio "Antena 1" e n?o acho que eles repitam demais as músicas novas.<br>  <br>  Pelo que eu percebo, os lan?amentos que tocam na "Antena 1" ("Bleeding love", da Leona Lewis; "No one", da Alicia Keys; etc) tocam mais ou menos com a mesma freqüência que as músicas mais velhas tocam. <br>  O repertório da "Antena 1" n?o é muito vasto, pois eles só tocam músicas internacionais, que fizeram muito sucesso em determinada época e em determinado país, que tenham qualidade e que combinem com o perfil da rádio. Como s?o poucas as músicas que satisfazem todos esses requisitos, o repertório da "Antena 1" acaba sendo menos variado do que o das outras rádios. Aliás, n?o s?o penas os lan?amentos que tocam repetidamente, mas algumas músicas mais velhas também tocam com freqüência na "Antena 1", como "Ever the same", do Rob Thomas; "Hunter", da Dido, "Listen to your heart", do Roxette; "Patience", do Take That; "Great romantic", do Tunde; "What hurts the most", do Rascal Flatts, e várias outras cujos nomes eu n?o sei.<br>  Quanto aos flshbacks dan?antes, eles n?o fazem a menos diferen?a para mim, pois eu n?o gosto muito do repertório de músicas dan?antes da "Antena 1"; mas eu também me incomodo um pouco com a falta de interatividade da "Antena 1" com os ouvintes. N?o acho que eles devessem colocar programas com radialistas que ficam conversando com os ouvintes, mas acho que o pessoal que trabalha na "Antena 1" poderia ter uma maior participa??o nos programas, ao invés de falarem apenas nos horários em que um radialista dá lugar ao outro e na leitura das manchetes dos jornais.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!|`|84a9b0af04216f4cc2190ca66f9afdb4aa	? LO SEY RESPONDER|`|UVd61yxyaa	n?o é só a Antena 1 mas como também a Cidade FM.<br>  <br>  N?o sou uma ouvinte assídua da Antena 1 mas no caso da Cidade FM eu até gostava da esta??o, mas come?ou a ficar cansativa porque passa muitas vezes a mesma música num curto prazo de tempo, ent?o decidi mudar de preferência. Agora é Mega FM, Comercial e às vezes RFM...<br>  <br>  Eu sei como se sente!<br>  <br>  Fique bem ;)

61k6IoS3aa	Well, they have been around for a couple of years so im sure that they have seen people cooking before or even watched and read cooking shows and books. So they must have some sort of knowledge on the subject. They probably have had to cook before with Carlisle being a doctor he must have invited his fellow workers home to talk or be friends or whatever. and knowing esme's character she would have been planning the event for hours after alice or edward told her that edward was bringing bella home to meet them. so she would have done some research on what to cook and done some shopping for the ingredients that they would need.

But in this case its the Cullen family watching an episode on the Food Network and they are learning how to cook the food following the chef's instructions. So one can assume that they had been watching that show for awhile knowing that they were going to meet her soon.|`|D0SK7Dlfaa	Food Channel. They were watching the food channel or was it Food Network.|`|7uB42JzJaa	remeber they've been around for hundreds of years so they might have picked up some culinary skills in that time.

It was so cute and funny. I loved it, except for Miley Cyrus. Twilight was okay, but I saw that with my friends.|`|nhH68wOLaa	Yes, I have also went bowling by myself. I think it gives you time to think about events happening in your life and just gets you away.|`|qZqEnd42aa	i can't say that i have|`|SPBAF65aaa	yep.|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	Yea but not for along time. It was one of those that no one else wanted to see. but I had read the book so I didn't want to miss it|`|7piH1EvHaa	Nope.

I could go to whatever show I wanted, at whatever time I wanted, and I didn't have to worry whether a person who might be with me was having a good time, wanted popcorn and coke or candy or whether the seating was good for her.  It was a special treat, and it cost much less since I only had to pay for myself.  I enjoyed dating but then, sometimes I like to just pamper myself.  And if I ever thought there was a movie worth going to the theater for now, I might, and I might go by myself, whenever I wanted, and pay only for myself.  That sounds like a wonderful option.  God Bless you.|`|AA10269742	i go alone 80% of the time...going to the movies is a "me time" activity for me|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	all the time|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	only once, I believe<br>  |`|KzU1LRVhaa	Yes.

lvvlSiNEaa	I didn't watch it yet, but from what I heard it wasn't as good as the book. :(|`|AA11438201	My best friend saw it, with her volleyball teammates at midnight,<br>  and she'd give it a 5 or 6. She said it was pretty cheesy, if you had not read the book, but for everyone who did, they thought it was 'ok'. The book was much better apparently, and the only person who made it good was apparently Robert Pattison, who made the whole movie worth while apparently. |`|YppszPxNaa	I didn't go see it myself but, my niece went. She says it is a 7ish. She read the series first and as usual, the movie can't have all the details of the book. It is for that reason that she rates it a 7. Once you've read the book, it can't quite do it justice.<br>  If it was a movie you went to see without ever reading the book, it would probably be a 9 or 10.|`|kTVI3KBLaa	didn't see it (not MY kind of flick) but just do some reading here.... i'd say most were DISAPPOINTED ;\|`|SeyaUqtmaa	I haven't seen it yet, looked a bit "young" for me on the previews, and I didn't even know it was a series (dates me a bit) until my brother skipped school to go see it with a group opening day. <br>  <br>  A bit of it was filmed in my parents small town (where my brother lives), which upped the craze over the movie, the books already were popular there.<br>  <br>  oh, and no my parents didn't agree to the skipping school part knowingly, they were asked if he could go at 11 and he neglected to say llam not pm (which they just assumed). Tickets were bought and rides arranged before they figured it out. LOL, smart teenager.|`|9EW08emXaa	It was good. I think I'd give it a 7.<br>  <br>  It follows the book pretty closely without actually being the book. They added scenes and took away scenes and the characters seem a little more "real". <br>  <br>  I think they did a good job.|`|PNLOrK7faa	alright,, i didnt read the book yet and i saw it, i thought it was really good!!! but my friend who did read the book said it wasnt as good but it was horrible,, id give it a 8|`|8VmahRqtaa	The acting sucked, the only one who could act was Cam Gigandet (James), but there were some hotties, and some occasional good parts.

But all my friends that have seen it are very disappointed. They said they messed up the whole book. And the worst part was how much they messed up the cafeteria scene. Plus they said Kirsten Stewart sucked. But I will just have to wait and see, I'm going within the next week sometime. <br>  <br>  I know that everyone said that the books were way better.

La película muestra breves fragmentos de película basados en experiencias y entrevistas a un equipo de especialistas en la transformación personal, maestros espirituales, maestros de cosmologia, expertos en generar riqueza, matemáticos, físicos cuánticos, etc.<br>  <br>  Tal y como muestra la película, los principios de la "Ley de Atracción" plantean que los sentimientos y los pensamientos de las personas se plasman en sus vidas como hechos reales, desde interacciones con el cosmos hasta interacciones entre personas de tipo físico, emocional y profesional. La película también hace referencia a la tendencia de la gente con poder a esconder al público este principio básico. El trailer de la película muestra a algunas personas que "descubrieron el secreto...".<br>  <br>  El Secreto esta basado en la ley de Atraction esta es una idea que ha existido por muchos tiempo. En los Estados Unidos existen varios maestros de la ley de atracción. Michael Losier, Jerry and Esther Hicks, Penny Jordan, Bob Proctor, Joe Vitale, Dr. Wilfredo Chevere, and Lynn Grabhorn.|`|VloI04YPaa	pues yo vi la pelicula y me parece la estu@#$@# mas grande del mundo, no creo en eso para nada! osea eso es solo para sacar dinero de la gente comprando el libro no hay nada de secreto pq eso todo el mundo lo haces..si quieres algo y luchas mucho para conseguirlo ps lo mas probable es que te suceda donde esta el secreto?

Mas depois disso vem a "tessitura" ou a extens?o vocal, as notas mais agudas e mais graves alcan?adas sem falsear a voz. Da mesma forma que os instrumentos, a voz humana de um bom cantor deve possuir uma tessitura larga e capaz de se amoldar a todas as melodias sem estar às mudan?as constantes de tom para lhe suprir a fraqueza.<br>  A terceira qualidade é a potência, coisa que hoje deixou de ser importante em fun??o da eletr?nica que faz de uma voz fraquinha uma potência de milhares de watts num campo de futebol. é bom lembrar que os primeiros cantores deveriam cantar para platéias de mais de 2 mil pessoas sem nada mais além do próprio pulm?o e garganta. Essa qualidade que hoje é omitida com os cantores que escostam a boca no microfone e que jamais poderiam cantar naquelas épocas em lugares além de suas privadas.<br>  A capacidade de modular (modula??o) a voz rapidamente dando-lhe um caráter diferente de acordo com a frase musical exigida é extremamente importante e é importantíssima para se diferenciar os cantores de banheiro de os cantores de verdade. Para isso é necessário ter uma dic??o perfeita e uma capacidade de articula??o impecável.<br>  O F?lego que é a qualidade que leva o cantor a aguentar uma nota alta, aguda, por muito tempo é coisa importante para definir o cantor eletr?nico do cantor verdadeiro.<br>  O timbre é a grandeza mais importante que enquadra a voz. é a quantidade de freqüências que recheiam a voz e a fazem reconhecível e peculiar. Um bom cantor deve ter um timbre denso e agradável. é o timbre que diferencia as taquaras rachadas dos cantores de verdade. Geralmente é a coisa mais perceptível na voz de qualidade.<br>  A interpreta??o é algo que ultrapassa a voz, mas dela se usa para fazer casar o elemento físico e abstrato que juntos d?o uma sensa??o agradável ao canto.<br>  Assim, o cantor com todas essas qualidades, aquele que faz o cora??o tremular e a emo??o surgir como uma fonte jorrante, forte e definida, pelo que ouvi até hoje, escapam dois cantores surpreendentes:<br>  <br>  Orlando Silva, cantor nacional, seresteiro de voz grave, potente, natural e timbre extraordinário.<br>  e:<br>  Mário Lanza, cantor norte americano de origem italiana. Sua voz era incrível, assim como sua interpreta??o.<br>  Os que n?o concordarem, se dêem à chance de ouvi-los e depois com certeza mudar?o de opini?o!<br>  Valeu.<br>  <br>  P.S. O meu negativador deve ter uma latrina no ouvido, pois em música há o bom gosto, que é o meu caso, infelizmente raro, e o "bom desgosto" que é o caso dele!

bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Achei essa sua pergunta muito interessante! Eu n?o sabia que a Duffy, a Jordin Sparks e a Leona Lewis foram reveladas nas vers?es estrangeiras do programa "ídolos". Eu só sabia da Kelly Clarkson.<br>  <br>  Os vencedores do "ídolos" n?o fazem sucesso porque eles n?o tem personalidade artística. Eles s?o apenas cantores com boas vozes e que cantam afinado. Eles n?o fazem sucesso porque as músicas que eles cantam n?o s?o boas e n?o têm estilo próprio. Se você parar para refletir, vai ver que a maioria desses cantores que participam do "ídolos" e do "Fama" (aquele reality show musical que passava na Globo) s?o imita??ezinhas da Elis Regina, da Sandra de Sá, do Caetano Veloso, da Gal Costa, do Cazuza e de outros artistas da MPB.|`|BgwI4y9eaa	ficar famoso no Brasil é muito fácil, basta ir na tela mostrar o rabo e fazer baixarias.... por isso fica dificil saber o que realmente é bom no brasil... principalmente programas honestos como esse que vc disse,<br>  acho que se as pessoas do ídolos estivessem met.endo ao vivo, ou passando algum cart?o de crédito na bunda, com certeza faria muito sucesso...|`|2t6BnleTaa	Porque os cantores daqui n?o chega nem aos pés dos cantores de lá,ou seja,pra agradar Americanos,Ingleses tem que ser mais que bom,tem que ser excelente pois existe a concorrencia muito grande como Rihanna , Beyoncé , Britney speark entre outras!!!por que vc acha que na parada mais Importante do Mundo que é a Billboad n?o tem nenhuma musica de Brasileiros ????porque eles n?o tem competencia pra fazer sucesso fora do Brasil e se fizer pode ter certeza que é só com os Brasileiros que moram fora do Brasil...|`|XKgOMsHfaa	bom, esse povo q vc citou aí q ficou famoso em tdo mundo, nunca ouvi falar d nguem<br>  e eh vdd, ngm fica famoso msm, e isso dv ser pq as pssoas q ganham s?o as pssoas erradas, pq se fosse uma Elis da vida, naum haveria superti??o q segurasse seu sucesso!|`|mFTZtgs4aa	N?o compare <br>  EUA com Brasil<br>  <br>  la é mais divulgado <br>  e aki foi ua cópia q <br>  nem a maioria das pessoas<br>  assistem ..<br>  <br>  Beijos ?|`|WPRXeXSUaa	PQ AQUI NINGUEM TEM TALENTO O SUFICIENT EPARA SER UM IDOLO|`|bDzRICBlaa	Olha oO !!!<br>  <br>  Sou vizinho do Matheus do Br`Oz.

Tendo em vista que, se ela for eliminada, o lado A da casa ficará com uma participante a menos e, consequentemente, terá grandes chances de ser extinto (tendo em vista que o lado B se tornará maioria, se eles conseguirem vencer todas as próximas provas do líder, eles poder?o come?ar a mandar duas pessoas do lado A para o pared?o).<br>  Pensando nisso, o lado A está pensando em combinar votos para que todos eles indiquem uma mesma pessoa do lado B para o pared?o, pois com uma pessoa do outro lado no pared?o, o grupo B pode ficar com um participante a menos e o lado A se tornará maioria.<br>  <br>  Na minha opini?o, a Naiá está puxando assunto com o pessoal do lado B por dois motivos:<br>  <br>  1- Identificar um adversário mais "perigoso" do outro grupo para que este seja indicado para o pared?o pelos participantes do grupo A. Imagino que ela esteja querendo enfrentar o Leonardo no pared?o.<br>  <br>  2- Conquistar a simpatia do outro grupo para que o Norberto n?o a indique a pared?o.

Respostas 20 perguntas, mas tive que excluir 5 porque o povo n?o respondia direito e falava que n?o sabiam responder, que gostaram da pergunta, que achou legal o que perguntei, que n?o sabia me responder, que n?o sabia se o tal candidato perdeu na elei??o ou n?o, ou seja, perderam 1 ótima oportunidade de n?o terem me respondido ou ent?o de pesquisar na NET sobre o que eu perguntava que eram coisas fáceis de responder, eu queria saber a opini?o do povo e as pessoas ficavam de bobeira dando respostas medíocres, coisa que nunca fiz aqui no Yahoo! Respostas. Até as outras 15 perguntas que fiz, algumas eu tive vontade de apagar,porque o povo n?o levou muito a sério e em todas elas teve muita gente que só respondeu mesmo com o intuito de se divertir ganhando 2 pontos. Quero que saiba Moony, que você n?o está sozinha nessa n?o, eu estou contigo e tor?o para que as novas pessoas que se inscrevem aqui como 1 internauta a mais n?o fa?am isso, para o site e tudo aquilo que perguntamos tem a credibilidade que merece!!<br>  Espero que você tenha gostado das minhas idéias e posi??es!!!<br>  Desejo tudo de bom para você Moony!!!!<br>  <br>  Beijim de Pielon!|`|eDVZrb1Kaa	Isso é um site que nos permite fazer perguntas e terem automaticamente respostas..<br>  Se essas pessoas respondem assim <br>  e porque elas querem ser melhor <br>  sendo que n?o s?ao nada.<br>  Eu acho que deveri?o mesmo Responder de acordo com a pergunta.<br>  Isso é falta de educa??o<br>  falta de compreens?o<br>  é só você n?o liga<br>  Deixe-os de lado|`|iFBw5VDraa	Eu concor do com vc.

Além disso, se ele continuar no programa ele pode virar líder e indicar o chato do Norberto pra pared?o.<br>  Quanto à Michelle, eu acho ela muito quieta e apagada (lembra um pouco a mala da Gyselle do BBB8), mas ela é mais bonita e um pouco mais simpática do que a Priscila.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!|`|alcurOCaaa	claro que é a piriguete de priscila, mulher mais vulgar manda ela ir dan?ar no creu.|`|y0JRa99Paa	Eu quero que a Priscila saia, ela é muito metida e muito piranha...., ela deve sair.|`|HX3Dq5Hyaa	poxa o velho voto logo no Max o cara bacaana poxa<br>  <br>  dai fica dificil<br>  <br>  eu gosto dos 3 =/|`|phviFTuCaa	? t? acompanhando ?, acho muito chato.pra mim ? tem mas gra?a, foi se o tempo...|`|yQG18E2vaa	Já votei na sonsa da Michele, santa do pau oco!

Organisms are connected to the organisms they consume by lines representing the direction of organism or energy transfer. <br>  <br>  It also shows how the energy from the producer is given to the consumer.Typically a food chain or food web refers to a graph where only connections are recorded, and a food network or ecosystem network refers to a network where the connections are given weights representing the quantity of nutrients or energy being transferred.|`|5e96d0fc3155f6d84f4cdb4b15ed0bacaa	it is if you want sweety|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes.

Também gostei muito da cena na qual a Lara foi encontrar o Halley na fazenda e de ver a Flora sofrendo na cadeia. Porém, uma das melhores coisas que aconteceram no último capítulo da novela foi a última cena, na qual a Donatela se lembrou da primeira vez que ela cantou com a Flora. Achei muito criativo a novela terminar com uma cena do passado que deu origem a toda a história.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!|`|vlsb3IoBaa	é aquela velha história: enrolam muito e no final acontece tudo em dois ou três dias. No geral, achei boa a trama, percebendo, porém, que o autor se perdeu em alguns momentos, já que quis abordar muitos temas ao mesmo tempo. E aqui vai o meu PROTESTO: Vcs viram o que aconteceu à personagem de Helena Ranaldi, a Dedina? Foi escurra?ada, virou andarilha e... morreu doente na rua! E, vcs viram o que aconteceu ao Dami?o? N-a-d-a! Ou melhor, a noiva implorou pra voltar pra ele, ganhou um pai e dois irm?os. A cena final n?o foi outra, sen?o, um doce e longo beijo após um pedido de casamento! Ent?o, voltamos aos tempos de Cristo, quando uma mulher foi pega em adultério e os hipócritas pegaram em pedras para apedrejá-la? Fiquei com vergonha.

Na minha opini?o, ela é uma das melhores do Brasil, juntamente com o também ótimo Tadeu Schmidt.<br>  Acho a Renata Fan espontanea, divertida, inteligente e bem-informada. Além disso, ela é um exemplo de profissional a ser seguido, pois ela come?ou como uma assistente de palco do Milton Neves e, aos poucos, com seu talento e simpatia, conquistou destaque e se tornou uma grande apresentadora. <br>  Já o Kajuru é antipático, metido, fofoqueiro e n?o tem o menor senso de profissionalismo. Ele só consegue espa?o na mídia porque fica falando mal dos outros. Ele parece mais uma velhinha fofoqueira do que um apresentador de programa esportivo.<br>  Ele deve ter inveja da Renata Fan!<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!!|`|7jxFFm3oaa	Bicho, o cara falou merda...uma tremenda gatinha e ele me fala uma coisa dessas.

Além disso, várias vezes ele apareceu falando mal dos outros participantes.<br>  <br>  2o Alexandre: me desculpe por discordar de você, mas eu n?o acho as atitudes dele muito autênticas. Na minha opini?o, ele está querendo bancar o "bonzinho" na casa e jogando baixo ao colocar o Newton como manipulador e mau-caráter (mais ou menos como o idiota do Dr. Marcelo fez com o Fernando no BBB8). O Newton só organizou a combina??o de votos pra proteger o grupo A e para evitar que duas pessoas do grupo dele fossem pro pared?o, o que eu acho que foi muito legal da parte dele. Depois, ele votou na Priscila n?o por medo de ir para o pared?o, pois estava óbvio que o grupo B combinou votos pra colocar a Michelle no pared?o, mas para ajudar a Michelle a escapar do pared?o com o Max, que é um participante forte. Quem n?o tem caráter, na minha opini?o, é o Alexandre, que virou as costas pro grupo A.<br>  <br>  3o Leonardo: ele ouvia todas as fofocas do Norberto e n?o criticava ele, pelo contrário, em alguns momentos, até ajudou o Norberto a falar mal de outras pessoas.<br>  <br>  4o Naiá: ela é muito for?ada e fica tentando bancar a alegre pra conquistar o público.<br>  <br>  5o Michelle: ela é muito quieta e apagada. Na minha opini?o, ela tenta fingir que é santinha que nem a Gyselle fez no BBB8. Além disso, ela n?o demonstrava estar muito disposta a participar da combina??o de votos (assim como o Alexandre) e só fez isso na hora da vota??o pra tentar se livrar do pared?o.<br>  <br>  Quanto aos outros, todos me parecem ser muito autênticos; principalmente o Flávio, o Newton, o Max e a Francine. Já os outros participantes, nenhum me deu motivos para duvidar de sua sinceridade, mas eu n?o fui com a cara da Priscila e da Mirla.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!!!!|`|kpTTvYOOaa	Acho que a Naná e o Nonó s?o os mais falsos...|`|whgbRySjaa	aquele veio safado,a velha,francine,max,pricila e outro lá do grupo b que eu n?o lembro!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  jssssss|`|850552ddf34f5e8acdaa51253ec485c9aa	Concordo com Stifler e acrescento mais um, a Nana, ela é um  porre e mandona.|`|gHNhXMGNaa	concordo com vc, o lado A n?o se salva ninguém, mas agora a máscara do nono caiu né|`|chwIsI6raa	Aquele velho tarado.....
bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Eu deixei de acreditar na imparcialidade do BBB a partir do BBB8!<br>  <br>  Na edi??o passada, aconteceram várias coisas que me fizeram questionar a imparcialidade do programa, como aquele lance do BigFone criado do nada no 2o pared?o do programa, o pared?o no qual a Juliana perdeu pro Dr. Marcelo, a prova da cabine na qual o Dr. Marcelo venceu e a desclassifica??o do Alexandre, da Tati e do Marcos na prova do líder que a Thalita venceu.<br>  Na minha opini?o, todas essas coisas foram criadas pela produ??o pra beneficiar participantes polêmicos, como o Dr. Marcelo e a Thalita e para evitar que o Rafinha enfrentasse a Gyselle em um pared?o antes da final.<br>  Quanto à bolha dessa edi??o, eu também achei que foi uma grande marmelada! Detestei a escolha dos participantes que foi feita pela produ??o, pois eu queria que o Emanuel, a Josiane e a Maíra fossem para a casa do BBB. Eu acho que os participantes da Casa de Vidro deveriam ter sido escolhidos por sorteio ou por alguma prova.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!|`|97b912f0fc5a743154a34cf615ede5b7aa	Acho que a Globo ta de mal a pior.... gra?as a Deus tenho tv a cabo, e por conta disso tenho a op??o de n?o assistir BBB9, pq ninguem merece tv aberta...|`|yAk8hiORaa	No dicionário da Globo, n?o existe a palavra parcial. é tudo manipulado.

Além disso, se ele continuar no programa, ele poderá virar líder e indicar o chato do Norberto para o pared?o.<br>  Quanto à Michelle, eu achei ela muito quieta e apagada (ela lembra um pouco a chatinha da Gyselle do BBB8), mas ela é mais bonita que a Priscila e parece ser um pouco mais simpática também.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!|`|4wAcF10Gaa	Michele, e fico torcendo pelo Max.|`|ff3d7e22f27045a724bc85df5972419caa	Tem que cair fora o Max, cara de sonso.

Já a Michele n?o deu para conhecer direito ainda, já a Priscila a cara já diz tudo, super vulgar, pared?o nela!|`|f6b553064f54301cf23244f1b6012fddaa	Max é gente boa, da paz...<br>  Michele...é meio "come quieto", tenha medo desses tipinhos...<br>  Priscila...definitivamente acaba com a imagem da mulher, muito vulgar, descompreendida, e acabou com o ditado de que apenas as loiras s?o burras. Como é que uma criatura dessas fica mostrando suas pe?as intimas p todos assim, e ainda se diz incomodada se elas n?o forem fio dental. N?o tinha nem que ter entrado...portanto já ta mais que na hora de sair.|`|nELo4KRwaa	A Michele, pois o Max tá de rolo e a Priscila dá uma esquentada nas festas ;D|`|j77zeyAgaa	Priscila..|`|y0JRa99Paa	Voto para que a Priscila saia, ela é muito piranha....., ela tem que sair....|`|2t6BnleTaa	Priscila .|`|3f4dv2Ekaa	Michele a sonsa|`|C0bR58D3aa	priscila tem q sair!|`|TZPd0bdeaa	MAX|`|463cc6832aedfa84c7119478eaa0576baa	Vou votar na Michele !!|`|0NDTSvH9aa	Michele... Mto sem Sal|`|n1tPOMbeaa	O velho é mais esperto do que se pensa. Primeiro ele disse que ia votar numa pessoa do lado B, depois disse que quando soube da sacanagem do Lado A em votar em grupo em alguém do lado B,  disse que ia votar em alguém do lado A. Só que ele ficou no lado A um temp?o e descobriu que a mo?ada ia votar em peso na Priscila, ent?o ele aproveitou para se livrar de 2 ao mesmo tempo e conquistar a simpatia de 7 pessoas do lado A. Ele está achando que v?o sair 2 pessoas neste pared?o e está crente que é o Max e a Priscila. Ele pensa que o povo é burro ao dizer que nós gostamos de bunda. Eu votaria na Priscila, mas por causa da sacanagem desse coroa metido a garot?o, eu voto na Michele. E estou torcendo para ele n?o pegar a lideran?a de novo para cair fora logo. Fica fazendo pose , falando sozinho , é um babaca!|`|xipPlVTWaa	o falso max|`|H4SPaMOgaa	Michele sem duvida!!! Quem assiste ao PPV sabe mto bem o que ta acontecendo. A mulherada ta contra a Priscila pq ela faz o tipo de mulher gostosona, mas é uma pessoa madura, bonita e que n?o se envolve em fofoca, pelo menos até agora, além disso ela já disse que é sem pudores. Acho que é uma pessoa autentica e lutadora!!!<br>  A michele é uma sonsa com aquele olho de peixe morto, uma chata sem tamanho, que acha que é melhor que todo mundo só pq é miss, dá pra ver que ela é bem sonsa, dispensou o cara na festa mas depois ficou dan?ando e se insinuando pra ele e o pior é que o povo acha que ela é santinha. <br>  O Max é um fofo, animadissimo....faz um par bem legal com a Fran, acho que ele é super do bem!!!|`|CHE3zNxFaa	Jah votei na Michelle|`|SkEL25xXaa	Oiiii concerteza quem deve sair é a PRISCILA, é muito se acha, se insibi de mais, se acha aí q nojo q eu tenho n?o gostei dela de cara....

Lindoooo|`|xql3pXfYaa	Que saia o Max, desde o primeiro aparecimento dele eu disse que também seria o primeiro a sair...arrogante...|`|HmwRFGSZaa	Priscila. A garota já tem uma carreira iniciada, já fez ensaios pra revistas, desfiles e outros e, n?o precisará de um ponta-pé inicial. Este início no BBB já vai ajudá-la um pouquinho mais. <br>  Quanto aos outros que est?o na berlinda precisam de um pouco mais de tempo no BBB pra se afirmarem na vida artistica. O artista plástico Max tem todo o meu apoio pelo seu jeito leve de ser.|`|BEn8wb0Qaa	Com toda a certeza eliminaria a Priscila. Ela é aquele tipo de mulher vulgar, que a meu ver empobrece o programa. O que ela tem pra mostrar, além da bunda e dos peit?es?? BBB pra ser interessante tem que ter um certo nível cultural. <br>  Fora Priscila!!|`|hjEHantZaa	elimino  a Michele e o próximo pared?o tem que estar o JUDAS ESCARIOT ( NORBETO )  e ele vai ter recorde de votos 99,99% pela trai??o de grupo.|`|zXQ8ktiOaa	Michelle.. só para voltar os dois e cair a cara daquele senhor falso...|`|9fYCm3Vlaa	Priscila. <br>  <br>  Vulgar, gorda se achando gostosa, nao tem nada na cabe?a, faz a linha "quanto mais puta mais ibope eu terei", fica se mostrando como se isso fosse garantia de votos... e no Brasil, que definitivamente N?O é um país sério, realmente parece que ela está conseguindo. <br>  <br>  Só aqui para um publico tirar a educada e simpática Michele, e deixar a outra soh pq fica mostrando a bunda e os peitos. PS: A barriga dela é maior que a minha|`|7KZ94RG6aa	Eu acho que o Max deveria sair porque além de ser muito mand?o, é enjoado e se acha de mais. A Priscila também n?o é flor que se cheire e eu acho que a decis?o vai ficar entre o Max e ela.|`|XfXvWvqdaa	Priscila, vulgar e exibida. Até agora n?o tenho nada contra a Michele e acho que o Brasil devia dar uma chance pra conhecer ela melhor.|`|9TBJOyRcaa	Eu Votei na Priscila. Acho muito legal quando o BBB escolhe pessoas bonitas para participar, mas essa Priscila está passando dos limites, ela é muito vulgar. Hoje a tarde ent?o...... Ela falou que n?o namoraria homens q n?o tem carro, que já transou em cima do telhado, que nunca experimentou pica da cor de chocolate (homens ******). Vale-me Deus. A televis?o brasileira n?o precisa disso. Acho melhor ela sair agora, vai fazer playboy, ganhar uma graninha.... já deu..... O BRASIL N?O é APENAS ISSO!!!!!!|`|2wUbxK5maa	max pois a Priscila é um colírio para os nossos olhos e a Michele é uma gatinha por isso eu escolho o max.|`|fEt5wnnAaa	Eu elimino a Priscila,<br>  Porque ela ta toda se achando na casa...<br>  Ela é muito de joga charme e depois fica cortando os caras. fica só se fazendo... soltinha demais pra quem tem namorado..<br>  coitadinho dele..hehehe.. e mau come?ou...<br>  Eu tor?o para que a Michele fique!|`|so31BZlnaa	Priscila deve sair para ficar mais leve a casa B... desagradável, nem deveria ter sido escolhida...

Eu v? !|`|W1Cb4XqXaa	N?o gostei da MICHELLE!! Portanto vai pra ela meu voto!!<br>  E antes de julgar qualquer pessoa eu prefero conhece-lá, pois n?o é o q estou vendo akii.. Muitas pessoas est?o julgando a Priscila de uma forma mt ridícula.. Cada um tem seu jeito de ser.. Chamar uma pessoa de vaca sem ao menos poder provar isso é uma ignorancia.. <br>  Se ela usa roupas ousadas, é pq ela gosta e tem corpo pra isso..<br>  Se ela dan?a extravasando, é pq é o jeito dela de dan?ar e ninguém vai mudar isso.. <br>  Tudo bem q o BBB é realmente para julgarmos e avaliarmos as pessoas, pois ent?o, só est?o aki dando minha opini?o da situa??o..<br>  Ahhh.. e adorei a resposta da Eloa.. hehe o Max tem q ficar mesmoooo!!

No próximo se o Norberto estiver no pared?o, eu voto mais de 1000 vezes para ele sair. Cara é o maior deslumbrado e vingativo.....está com ciúmes da Francine e votou no Max por que além disso ainda acha que ele é gay.

O Max é um cara gente boa , divertido , sabe usar as palavras em momentos certos . Ele provavelmente se n?o der mancada será um forte candidato ao prêmio .. e olha que na enquete do uol antes de come?ar o bbb 9 ele era o menos cotado . Já a Priscila é uma menina linda e se rebola ou usa roupas curtas .... ela tem pra isso e o programa permite isso , aliás o programa até quer isso . Cuidado em classificar uma pessoa como pirigueti .... alguém pode classificar vocês como invejosas .... cobras ..... dissimuladas ..... etc . A Michelle é uma menina educada , bonita e quieta  .... sim muito quieta .... ela nada soma ao programa a n?o ser beleza ... e o programa n?o é de miss e com certeza pra ela , já abriu muitas portas da vida .... durou o que tinha que durar .|`|b1a1f9c0a3df8ce116206437eedd1366aa	MICHELE|`|oDSgxetsaa	gentem e claro que Pricila!pelo amor de Deus, a mulher e muiiiito<br>  idiota, n fala coisas serias, n tem nada na cabeca!|`|FSLzmC8iaa	Priscila|`|aa3fd162588c63eee66b115596ba56e4aa	Elimino a michele o que é aquilo uma mistura de mulher com n?o sei o que seria um ET ou qualquer outra coisa tem que ir possar nua na G Magasine ? para se definir.|`|dUKMssl0aa	MICHELE|`|HTOy1nY7aa	seria enjusto max saio o vovo so votou nele<br>  por ciume dele com franscine <br>  pricila tem que sair|`|ESMg3FE1aa	eu votei na pricila...porque ela ta muito saidinha...<br>  so fica de bunda pra camera...ta se achando de mais...<br>  ta certo ela e uma tremenda mulher mais isso nao quer deser q deve acabar com os valores morais das mulheres brasileiras...<br>  entao sai PIRIGUETE! e aquele velho safado com ciumes da michele mando o coitado do max pro predao !!AI Q EU TO DOIDA Q ESSE VELHO VAI PRO PAREDAO !!!ha e sera qa pri ta querendo pousra pra play boy...naaaaaaaaooo imagina ne galera!kkkk|`|zo5pF6Zwaa	Elimino Michelle .

Na pesquisa do site Terra, a Michelle é a mais rejeitada entre os emparedados, mas a diferen?a entre eles é pequena.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eu n?o acho que no BBB só vence quem é da "turma da safadeza".

Aliás, em geral quem fica só na pega??o dentro do programa costuma ser eliminado.<br>  Na minha opini?o, se a Michelle for eliminada, vai ser porque ela é apagada demais e parece ser do tipo de mulher que se faz de santinha.

O melhor programa da TV Aberta de 2008 foi o CQC, superou as expectativas do público. Faz uma sátira a nossa realidade de uma forma c?mica sem ser pesada e agressiva. Chega de programas que exibem bundas e peitos para ganhar audiência. O público precisa estar mais seletivo e assistir o que é melhor para a cabe?a. Tem o Jornal da Record, se n?o me engano o nome, o Fantástico e o Toma lá da cá.

Mas o Prelúdio, da TV Cultura, merece uma men??o honrosa. |`|eCftkhNlaa	A programa??o da tv aberta é um verdadeiro LIXO.<br>  O melhor prog. da tv aberta é CQC, sem dúvida.<br>  Tem também os 15 minutos da MTV. Rock gol de domingo.<br>  Gosto do Panico na tv. Tem também o Leitura Dinamica (rede tv)<br>  Agora quem n?o tem TV por assinatura, que assista novela 24 horas.<br>  <br>  Tem que assistir duming?o du faust?o (novela), zorra total (credo), vídeo show (puta que pariu mais novela), altas horas (entrevista com artistas de novela da globo claro), jo soares (30 anos a mesma coisa, os mesmos gestos, a mesma fala, uma copia prefeita do prog. david laterman).|`|1df096a3fd18582c8dc80f0dd349c123aa	Felizmente ainda é possivel ver bons programas na TV aberta, como os programas infantis da Cultura, os especiais da Globo (Globo Reporter, Minisséries e Profiss?o Reporter), jornalisticos (Leitura Dinamica, por exemplo), humorísticos (Casseta, Toma lá da cá, Show do Tom, CQC e alguns quadros do Zorra) e a séries do SBT (exemplo, Smalville, Arquivo Morto, Supernatural, etc.). Mas meu programa favorito é o "BOM DIA BRASIL", pois acho ele dinamico, interativo, crítico (coisa rara na globo), divertido e leve. é uma ótima op??o para come?ar bem o dia, pena que a Globo n?o use o modelo do Bom dia Brasil nos seus demais programas jornalisticos. |`|EaoV6Xveaa	CQC<br>  <br>  O programa que estreiou no Brasil superou todas as espectativas.|`|gdU1JDBeaa	CQC e O Aprendiz|`|3deGEPC5aa	Grey′s Anatomy - Seriado SBT "quinta-feira"|`|e7da4f62560c3ae38533b77d0fe378aeaa	é sacanagem comparar CILADA com CQC, s?o programas de humor distintos, cada um diferente do outro!

bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	As duas edi??es que eu mais curti foram o BBB5 (com a Tati Pink, o Jean, a Grazi e o Sammy) e o BBB7 (com a íris, o Diego Alem?o e a Flávia).<br>  Eu adorei o BBB5 porque os participantes mais legais foram os últimos a sair da casa e por causa daquela panelinha que tinha na casa e que tentava eliminar os participantes mais legais.<br>  Eu também gostei bastante do BBB7 por causa do casal íris e Alem?o (principalmente por causa da íris, que na minha opini?o é a melhor ex-BBB de todos os tempos) e por causa dos conflitos entre o trio (íris, Alem?o e Fani) e o grupinho do mal (Alberto, Aírton, Felipe Cobra, Analy, Carol e Bruna). Eu só n?o gostei mais dessa edi??o do que do BBB5 porque as participantes mais legais da casa, que eram a íris e a Flávia, saíram na metade do jogo.<br>  Quanto às outras edi??es, eu gostei de todas menos do BBB8. Aquele lance do Big Fone que criaram na última edi??o me pareceu arma??o e algumas provas do líder dessa edi??o também me soaram como arma??o da produ??o para colocar participantes mais polêmicos como líderes, como a Thalita e o Marcelo. Isso sem falar que ver aquela chata da Gyselle na final foi um saco.<br>  O BBB6 também foi chatinho, pois n?o havia muitos participantes interessantes. A única coisa boa que teve nessa edi??o foi a vitória da Mara, que era uma mulher legal e sincera e que precisava bastante do dinheiro. Quase todos os outros participantes dessa edi??o eram falsos e estavam só fingindo que eram bonzinhos para ganhar o programa, como a Thaís, o Gustavo, o Rafael, o Carlos e o Iran.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!!!!|`|SADuZpu4aa	eu gostei muito do bbb5em que tinha o jean, a grazi..e o insuportavel do rogerio...mas o mais legal foi o bbb7 da iris e do alemao...foi lindo|`|REJEV5JNaa	Aquele que o Jean participou.|`|3488e63cd569d5f1d9acd9661a4f1b3daa	Gostei mais do número dois.|`|P15sIgJnaa	foi o primeiro, pois como era novidade, os jogadores, entraram no programa sem saber como ia repercurtir aqui fora.

Acredito que a Globo come?ará a divulgar os nomes dos próximos participantes do BBB a partir de quinta-feira.<br>  <br>  Eu li algumas matérias sobre o próximo BBB em alguns jornais e o Boninho (diretor do BBB) disse que havará muitas novidades no próximo BBB e que uma delas será a Bolha. A Bolha consiste em um globo de vidro que ficará em um lugar público de S?o Paulo dentro do qual 4 pessoas ficar?o. Dessas 4 pessoas, uma será escolhida pelo público para ir para a casa do BBB e disputar o prêmio de 1 milh?o de reais com os outros participantes. <br>  O Boninho também disse que, no elenco do BBB9, haverá mais pessoas acima dos 30 anos.<br>  <br>  Imagino que esse pequeno mistério seja uma jogada de marketing da Globo e que muitas novidades ocorrer?o na próxima edi??o.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!|`|EWAmcdK5aa	Escolheram 18 pessoas, mas, somente 14 entraram na casa dia 13, os outros 4 ficaram em uma casa construida dentro do via parque, ( proximo à escada) onde a inten??o é que o público escolha um entre os 4 para juntar-se aos outros 14 da casa.|`|1YB9Uym9aa	tbm estranhei....ontem mesmo eu estava comentando isso c/ a minha prima....<br>  <br>  decerto eles fazem isso pra ficar mais emocionante na estréia....aih mais pessoas v?o assistir pra conhecer os participantes....<br>  <br>  eh tatica pra aumentar o ibope!<br>  <br>  mas pode ser q tenha novidades  pra tentar fazer o programa ter mais sucesso, porq o ultimo BBB naum foi lah dos melhores....<br>  <br>  bjs!!!!!|`|8huk0eoqaa	eu sei que logo no come?o<br>  4 dos participante v?o ficar confinados em uma "bolha de vidro"<br>  e que o públiico tera de escolher qual deles vai contiinuar no jogo e conhecer a casa<br>  <br>  Beijo|`|2t6BnleTaa	Eu acho q é pra criar uma expectativa mais parece q os participantes já foram escolhidos . !!|`|Q63Lhh0caa	pra criar mais expectativa, i tentar conseguir  ainda mais  popularidade|`|gUfYS94Taa	Porque a divulga??o de participantes e outras coisas geralmente come?a a ser feita quando falta uma semana ou até menos para o início do programa.

6bafb6e222761aab2d8e96370500275daa	Será que esta é mesmo uma pergunta justa? Você está comparando uma mulher com 25  anos de carreira com uma que tem pouco mais de 3. é muito difícil compará-las. Eu pessoalmente prefiro um pouco o R&B ao Pop neste momento e terei de dizer Rihanna mas a Madonna é a rainha da pop e isso é indiscutível. A melhor cantora é a Rihanna. Ela tem uma voz mais poderosa e mais agradável pois a Madonna tem apenas "um fiozinho" de voz. Certamente n?o tem a sua fama pela voz e sim pelas músicas e pelos espetáculos que monta. A minha música favorita da Madonna talvez seja a "Frozen", o videoclip também é lindíssimo. Da Rihanna talvez a minha favorita seja a "Good girl gone bad" mas adoro também a "Million Miles Away" e "Take a bow".|`|xPII1XZsaa	Rihanna... n?o gosto da Madonna<br>  As musicas da Rihanna q eu mais gosto s?o Disturbia e Good Girl gone bad... e SOS tbm|`|OvgJfvc2aa	bom.. partindo do principio q a Rihanna ta fazendo musica com a msma batida sempre...<br>  prefiro a MAdonna<br>  <br>  e a musica q eu mais gosto dela eh get together|`|2mfcQLEWaa	Rihanna!!!!|`|AoeeRHEpaa	Rihanna... suas músicas s?o melhores e seu estilo é bem marcante.|`|txt5zTMPaa	Madonna..Com certeza..tdas as musicas dela s?o boas...|`|bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Eu prefiro a Rihanna!<br>  <br>  Ela canta melhor do que a Madonna e as músicas dela também s?o mais legais do que as da Madonna.<br>  <br>  A música da Rihanna que eu mais curto é "Umbrella".<br>  Entre as músicas da Madonna, a minha favorita é "Hung up".<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!!|`|XIAbCzAJaa	As duas =D|`|45597c9cbf82135231481d396812f9fcaa	Elas tem estilos bem diferentes e como o carinha aí falou uma é a rainha do Pop com quase 30 anos de carreira e outra tens uns 3 anos.

Acho mais legal ver todos os participantes convivendo juntos! Espero que a Globo perceba logo que esse lance de dividir a casa é a maior furada e desista logo da ideia.<br>  Aliás, acho que nesse BBB a Globo vai dar um monte de mancadas! A ideia da Casa de Vidro até que foi bacana, mas eu detestei a escolha dos participantes. Das 4 pessoas que ir?o para a Casa de Vidro, eu gostei de 3 (Emanuel, Josiane e Maíra). Eu acho que a Globo deveria ter feito um sorteio para selecionar os participantes da Casa de Vidro ou alguma prova. <br>  Outra coisa que eu li em um jornal que iria ter no BBB9 e que eu n?o gostei é o lance de alguns participantes que n?o s?o líderes serem sorteados votar fora do confessionário, na frente dos outros participantes. Isso só vai servir pra prejudicar os participantes sorteados!<br>  Pode ser que haja algum participante muito legal na casa que anime essa edi??o do BBB, mas, no que depender das novidades do programa, essa edi??o tem tudo para ser uma porcaria.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!!|`|XNEUqdwGaa	eu n?o gostei das novas novidades..;poxa nada a ver...;um grupo fica com piscina e um luxo a ′′mais′′, enquanto os outros ficam com um luxo a ′′menos′′? poxa nada a ver...;nada a ver ainda mais foi aqela casa de vidro dentro de um shoping...; agora eles já querem conseguir audiencia de todo jeito; qndo o povo do lado ′′pobre′′ foi conhe?er seu quarto, estavam faltando uma cama, eles já fazem isso pra rolar um clima e o povo cair no sexo..!!

a1Ngi39Xaa	Did you see Tyra fake a dizzy spell so the Social Worker supervising her visit with Ana today would run and get her a glass of water?  She got Ana to bolt out the door with her!!<br>  <br>  I totally lost all my respect for Karen today, after her discussion with Tyra.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	yeah, i know karen lied to tyra but i don't blame her. tyra didn't tell neil when he was still single how she felt, she waited until he and karen were married, so it proves that tyra can't be trusted and she's a homewrecker and i also think she's after money. i hope karen beats the crap out of tyra. of course, neil will probably cheat on her with tyra though cause they all sleep around on there.|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	I think Karen should have confronted Tyra for seducing her husband. I guess she wants to be sure Ana is hers for good before ousting the Ho. Tyra should have known better than to bite the hand that feeds her!!|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Tyra shouldn't be kissing and lusting after Karen's husband|`|LkTcLWTOaa	sorry i agree with Mrs. Fox. Neil used to be such a stand up guy who would never think of cheating on his wife and tyra is all over him.

But instead of confronting her like a woman she is pulling this sneaky crap. But you know what karen has been slimy from the beginning by telling ana to call her mama karen. She is just miserable cuz she can't have kids of her own. She will never be able to keep neil either ugggh can't stand that beaaatch|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	Yes I was wondering at first she was playing it so cool with Neil like nothing happened and then today when she told Tara that they where both anxious to adopt Anna well I got her plan it was clear she is going to try and convince like you say Tara that Neil is just using her and I think its working because Tara and Anna both ran off today|`|AA10423186	yes i  did

3h17hxraaa	The standard on a modern classical organ is as follows - <br>  <br>  Manual - 61 notes - 5 octaves<br>  At 8' pitch (same as piano) the range is C2 to C7<br>  <br>  Pedal - 32 notes - 2 1/2 octaves<br>  At 8' pitch the range is C2 to G4<br>  <br>  Notes may be played at different pitch depending on the rank of pipes (or electric equivalent) used.<br>  <br>  Common pitches are - 64' - 32' - 16' - 10 2/3' - 8'(unison/piano) - 5 1/3' - 4' - 2 2/3' - 2' - 1 3/5' - 1 1/3' - 1'<br>  <br>  The highest possible note would be the C7 on a manual played at 1' pitch or 3 octave higher than notated (C11)<br>  <br>  The lowest possible note would be the C2 on pedal played at 64' pitch - there are no manual ranks at 64' pitch - three octaves lower than notated (C00)<br>  <br>  Here is the notation of the range - <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Organ_Range.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Organ_...</a>|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Every organ is different. The majority of organs have two manuals and a pedal board. Each manual is 61 notes, but that does not mean that the range of the organ is five octaves (or ten octaves) Each manual can control ranks of pipes of various lengths. An 8' pipe rank is considered normal, middle C sounding middle C. The pipe does not have to be exactly 8', but it's close (for open pipes; capped pipes sound an octave lower, so a 4' Gedact, Stopped Diapason, or Bourdon would also sound middle C.<br>  <br>  I believe the largest stop currently installed is in the sydney town hall organ, which has a true 64' Contra Trombone stop in the pedal division. In this case "Middle C" sounds the note equivalent to the lowest C on a piano. ... and you've got a few octaves below that to play with. 32' stops are fairly common in organ dispositions., going the other way, 2' and 1' stops are also common, they add brightness to the registration. In almost no case would you ever use just extremely low or high ranks of pipes to solo on.<br>  <br>  ... Just to add fuel to the fire, there are Mixture stops, stops that sound at harmonics of the fundamental (Mixtur IV, or Nasard  5 1/3') celeste stops that are slightly sharp or flat from an identical stop on the organ to provide some "chorus texture" to the sound. <br>  <br>  Arguably the largest functional organ is the Wanamaker organ at Macy's in Philadelphia, the Atlantic City convention center organ is much larger, but much of it is not working.<br>  <br>  Organ Stop Pizza, (Mesa, AZ) features a colorful 32' Diaphone rank visible through the glass wall at the front of the building.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	This is a difficult question since all organs are different, you can get specifics on some from Groves Encyclopedia of M & Ms, or from the liner notes of some CDs, but I'll give you a general answer. This is from Richard Strauss, in his comments in Berlioz's treatise on Orchestration, so reflects the best knowledge in the early 1900s:<br>  The (then) present keyboard range C1 to f'' on the pedal, and C to g''' or a''' on the manual. Older instruments having C to c' or d' on pedal, C to f''' on manual". C1 is the lowest note on a Double bass, C lowest in cello or 2 octaves below middle C or c'. f' is first line on treble staff, g''' is 1 octave higher than the G on the top line of the treble staff.<br>  These do not need to sound the notes played. The organ has ranks of pipes called stops. The normal is an 8 foot pipe for the manual lowest C. There are also ranks based on 16 and 32 feet ( I am aware of large organs with 64') they transpose the note played down by one or two octaves respectively. There are pipes of 4', 2', and 1' they transpose the note up 1, 2, or 3 octaves so the highest G or A, is 4 octaves beyond the G at the top of the treble staff. That is an octaive and a ffth higher than the piano. On the low end the 32' pipe allows the organ to sound an octave below the double bass, or the C below the lowest a on the piano.<br>  Modern sources can list the range of the pedal to G above the F mentioned above, and for the manual, to the C above the G.<br>  You have the info and my source, you will find more in Grove's Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians.

LwqM7EHVaa	Jim Morrison and Paul McCartney should be removed.. Let it be and Hey Jude are one of my favorite.. People are strange and Riders on the storm too..|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	I agree on over half of them but they are a few I really like, such as Queensryche and Jim Morriosn. Whoever put Jim Morrison on there should be ashamed of themselves.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	No. It's a bad list.<br>  Then again, it is Blender magazine.|`|aBhW9YVXaa	NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! these are all the best..donovan, paul mcCartney, and ben gibbard, ...whoever made this list was on crack when they were making most of it|`|JyxNA1o0aa	QUEENSRYCHE!?

I agree with Jim Morrison, he just tried to act to deep, that main was as shallow as it gets, and that showed. I want to dispute Robert Plant, but while his musical talent is amazing he couldn't exactly be considered a groundbreaking lyricist. My old buddy Paul (McCartney) doesn't deserve to be on the list though. Otherwise, I think I would just shift people around, maybe slide a certain KISS member farther up the list.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I like most of the people on this list. I've seen this before ... I have to imagine it's written by some bitter hack who couldn't cut it as as musician and ended up writing *about* music instead. I'd like to see these twits come up with half of the creativity of a Neil Peart (one of the best lyricists in the biz) or Jim Morrison. What a complete joke.|`|MNyYWoFfaa	"Jon Dolan, Josh Eells, Tim Grierson, Andrew Harrison, Ben Mitchell, Tony Power and Mark Yarm"<br>  <br>  These guys don't know sh*t!<br>  <br>  Jim Morrison at no. 10???

Billy Corgan is cool! :D|`|pR78oUlhaa	pretty good but i'd take Corgan, Ian Anderson, and Morrison off - they're cool|`|AA10092952	Baha Sting. <br>  <br>  But Jim Morrison and Billy Corgan? >=/ <br>  Thats not right. Not right at all.|`|XaunUuEdaa	I am very happy whit this list, sting really sucks, he's always talking about love and weird things.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would change noel gallager for fall out boy, as much as i hate noel gallager and oasis, i know that they're not a bad band.<br>  <br>  And this guy will i am, he's very creative, i mean, he's not doing poppy ****, he's good at least, throught i don't like his music, i'm not into that, besides, he's not rock, what the heck is he doing there, well anyway.<br>   would change him for britney spears, i don't hate her, i admired her when i was little, and you know, everyone loved britney in some moment, but her lyrics suck, i know she doesn't write them, i like the blackut album lyrics, but the others really suck.|`|9039823cd4de02e1d32357ccf08839e5aa	Ian Anderson, Jon Anderson, Neil Peart, Robert Plant and Paul McCartney need to be taken off this list! All of their lyrics are very original and are all very good. Except for some of them, the list is terrible. Another question, why isn't Miley on this list?|`|dBKwElr5aa	this guy is the worst:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=452952449" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a>|`|UD93qolxaa	That looks pretty good except...<br>  Billy Corgan and Matisyahu have good lyrics...Anthony Kiedis's are weird, but they seem to work well....<br>  ...I would add Cannibal Corpse to that list.|`|wTkvkWscaa	Sting! hahaha|`|AgQForcYaa	ROBERT PLANT?! Jim Morrison?! Are they outta their gourds?!?!|`|GTWGVq1Vaa	Fred Durst should be no. uno....|`|zM9Lj21waa	this is just proof that any idiot can make up a list...i dont give it much creedence...|`|2FIbamFgaa	Some of it.|`|GbyHQQLiaa	I don't agree with some of this.<br>  <br>  Paul McCartney was a good lyricist, though nowhere near as good as George Harrison or John Lennon (I won't even mention Ringo Starr, well I guess I just did but whatever)<br>  <br>  KRS-One is one of the greatest hip hop lyricists of all time, not all hip hop is crap.<br>  <br>  Jim Morrison wasn't one of the worst although in the song The End it sounds like he was coming up with stuff off the top of his head and is just speaking gibberish.<br>  <br>  Noel Gallagher isn't that bad at all, not saying he's great either.<br>  <br>  The rest I would pretty much agree with but maybe put it in a different order.

She spent a few years out in the wild and had a couple of litters, so she seems to enjoy a warm house and regular food.

valvULe3aa	No, Mudhoney, The Melvins, etc. were the "creators" of grunge. Nirvana helped popularize & pioneer it.... All great bands, though!!<br>  <br>  Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle Sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the mid-1980s in the American state of Washington, particularly in the Seattle area. Inspired by hardcore punk, heavy metal and indie rock, grunge is generally characterized by heavily distorted electric guitars, contrasting song dynamics, and apathetic or angst-filled lyrics. The grunge aesthetic is stripped-down compared to other forms of rock music, and many grunge musicians were noted for their unkempt appearances and rejection of theatrics.<br>  <br>  The early grunge movement coalesced around Seattle independent record label Sub Pop in the late 1980s. Grunge became commercially successful in the first half of the 1990s, due mainly to the release of Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of hard rock music at the time.[1] However, many grunge bands were uncomfortable with this popularity. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, their influence continues to impact modern rock music.<br>  <br>  The word grunge is believed to be a back-formation from the US slang adjective grungy,[2] which originated in about 1965 as a slang term for "dirty" or "filthy." Mark Arm, the vocalist for the Seattle band Green River—and later Mudhoney—is generally credited as being the first to use the term grunge to describe this sort of music. Arm first used the term in 1981, when he wrote a letter under his given name Mark McLaughlin to the Seattle zine, Desperate Times, criticizing his band Mr. Epp and the Calculations as "Pure grunge! Pure noise! Pure ****!" Clark Humphrey, editor of Desperate Times, cites this as the earliest use of the term to refer to a Seattle band, and mentions that Bruce Pavitt of Sub Pop popularized the term as a musical label in 1987–88, using it on several occasions to describe Green River.[3] Arm used grunge as a descriptive term rather than a genre term, but it eventually came to describe the punk/metal hybrid sound of the Seattle music scene.[4]<br>  <br>  Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy guitar sound that uses a high level of distortion, fuzz and feedback effects. Grunge fuses elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. The music shares with punk a raw sound and similar lyrical concerns.[1] However, it also involves much slower tempos, dissonant harmonies, and more complex instrumentation – which is reminiscent of heavy metal. Some individuals associated with the development of grunge, including Sub Pop producer Jack Endino and The Melvins, explained grunge's incorporation of heavy rock influences such as Kiss as "musical provocation." Grunge artists considered these bands "cheesy" but nonetheless enjoyed them; Buzz Osborne of The Melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do and get away with.[5] In the early 1990s, Nirvana's signature "stop-start" song format became a genre convention.[1]<br>  <br>  Lyrics are typically angst-filled, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, confinement, and a desire for freedom. A number of factors influenced the focus on such subject matter. Many grunge musicians displayed a general disenchantment with the state of society, as well as a discomfort with social prejudices. Such themes bear similarities to those addressed by punk rock musicians[1] and the perceptions of Generation X. Music critic Simon Reynolds said in 1992 that "there's a feeling of burnout in the culture at large. Kids are depressed about the future."[6] However, not all grunge songs dealt with these issues. Nirvana's satirical "In Bloom" is a notable example of more humorous writing. Several other grunge songs are filled with either a dark or fun sense of humor—Mudhoney's "Touch Me I'm Sick" or Tad's "Stumblin' Man"—though this often went unnoticed by the general public at the time. Humor in grunge often satirized glam metal—for example, Soundgarden's "Big Dumb Sex"—and other forms of popular rock music during the 1980s.[7]|`|aklHEB3xaa	No one created "grunge" it's just a term that a reporter used to describe the type of music that was coming out of the northwest at the time. Nirvana was more of a punk styled band to me when I first heard bleach. As far as chart success Alice In Chains was before Nirvana with "Man In The Box" Other "grunge bands were around long before Nirvana. Look into Green River, Mother Love Bone, and Mudhoney for starters. The Melvins and The Pixes were also big influences. Look at wikipedia's page on it, it's fairly informative.|`|GIs1jMhHaa	No Sir.<br>  <br>  Grunge has been around for longer than Nirvana.

It's only 14 volumes long, meaning there are no stupid plot twists and that it wasn't dragged on for too long. there is action, romance supernatural and a sweet plot line.<br>  Story: 17 year old noriko was out with her friends one day when a terrorist bomb ctapoults her into another world where she is what is known as the awakening - a creature that will suposedly unlease a terrifying dewstructive force on the entire world. but what happens when this force rescues her and she finds herself falling in love with him?<br>  this one is actually only a manga, as it wasn't long enough to become an anime nor did it have a large enough fan base at the time of it's release. <br>  ***trust me, i know my summary isn't the best, but even though it isn't the most widely known manga, almost everyonw who reads finds themselves falling in love with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Special A<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  this one is hilarious! had me laughing like crazy. it has one of those super-dense but totally awesome main characters who you just want to yell at for totally not realizing this one guy is in love with her! you can watch the whole thing on youtube subbed<br>  <br>  <br>  W Juliet<br>  MANGA<br>  really romantic and sweet. the lead male character has been forced into making a deal with his father; if he can switch schools and remain in desguise as a girl without anyone realizing that he is a guy then he's free from all responsability and can pursue his dream of becoming actor. the main lead character, an extremely popular tom boy named ito discovers his secret and becomes his best friend. one of the more romantic ones that i've read. really sweet and there's a sequel.<br>  <br>  Chrono Crusade<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  super funny, very cute, so sad you have to cry. Rosetta is *like* a nun, who has made a contract with a demon/her best friend to find a way to rescue her apostle brother from the clutches of evil. she and her friends battle these demons in hand to hand combat leaving a trail of destruction accross new yorl [i think it was new york anyway lol]<br>  <br>  <br>  Ultra Maniac<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  i didn't actually watch the anime of this one, i just read the manga. once again it's cute and funny. more modern and up-to-date but still involves some magic. very cute and has multiple couples.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Karin<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  karin is a vampire who is a bit backwards -- she loves the sunlight, produces excess blood rather than having to obtain it from someone else, and loves humans. really quite cute and funny, though not the best i've seen.<br>  <br>  You may also enjoy absolute boyfriend or boys over flowers<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/...</a> -from far away<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/serie..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/serie...</a> -w juliet with an actual summary|`|pgIcxpiaaa	hmmm.why dont you try skip beat's creator's[sorry,forgot her name] other work,TOKYO CRAZY PARADISE? <br>  its uber-good.its action,romance and comedy.<br>  even if you dont like action,in this manga you'll like it ;]<br>  anywayss.<br>  the theme is strong girl,the guy likes herr.<br>  i recommend this to you,if you liked skip beat :3

C7baXdSZaa	I'm with you on this one and so is thousands of others out there. On the news today they were complaining abaut the way he deals with these promblems they dont like him either NOW. but before everyone thought that he was going to be the best ever! I mean just cuss he is black dosent mean he will take this country into the boom of the centrey. I am not saying that he didnt do some good but i just feel everyone expected a little too much of him. Not me though i figuerd he would be like any other president. And guess what? HE IS!|`|G6ein0naaa	I enjoy how the 13 year old children on here come to offer their opinions about this. Anyways, I don't care for him...at all. He talked about so many things that he planned on changing once he got into office. Now he's doing the exact opposite of everything. For example, Obama completely disagreed with the stimulus plan that the Republican's were going to pass. What does he do when he gets into office? Passes a stimulus plan.When the Republicans did it, everyone was against it. Now that our "savior" is in office, he couldn't have made a "better decision.<br>  He also said he was going to lower taxes for people making less than $250,000. Turns out that his tax cut would have made people that earn $100,000 or more pay more taxes rather than just those who earned $250,000 or more. <br>  Obama was also all for pulling the troops out of Iraq. Okay. So he wants to place them over in Afghanistan. I feel like I'm the only one that sees the hypocrisy of Obama's war plan. His war in the Middle East is estimated to be longer than Bush's war there. <br>  <br>  And he wasn't in office for 2 months before he released a statement saying "I screwed up". He's inexperienced at best. Most people don't realize that CLINTON started the downward economic spiral--not Bush. The whole situation is ridiculous. What's even more ridiculous is that I can't express my dislike of Obama in public without being deemed a racist.<br>  <br>  <br>  Whew. Felt good to let all that out.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	personally i don't like you!!!! i like him and i would rather have him than McCain any day . he is trying his best right now and it is still really early to start to judge wait a couple of years then make a decision|`|TApVoMdAaa	I don't like him either, or his plan. We won't get out of a depression by spending trillions. Common sense! His approval ratings are dropping like crazy.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	i agree with the first answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  although i supported him in the beginning.|`|NREqhragaa	idc. hes just a presdent.... o_o he's only staying 4 more years...|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Eh I really could care less. He's our president, we'll have lots more.|`|r8ST3cFIaa	How is he untrustworthy?<br>  He hasn't been president for very long yet so I'm not in favor of judging. <br>  Honestly, who could screw us over more than Bush has?|`|mgdkr6hvaa	i don't pay much attention to politics so i'm pretty much indifferent, but i have trust, if he got voted into presidency then he must have done something good to get into that spot, but then again bush became president.  <br>  It's a little early to tell, but he is at least trying his best to fix the country, the country is pretty F***** up at the moment so it's gonna take a lot to fix it.|`|2MZZ7Wtwaa	He is a puppet on Nancy P's strings.  He is nothing more than a figurehead, and sweety as much as I love your question it will no doubt be up for violation.  Listen to Rush Limbaugh, and all the conservative talk shows as much as you can.  Be wise and know the truth.  His followers, and that is all they are, truly think he is here to give them everything they need and want.  God help us people who actually work for our living.|`|ij9N9r5waa	Hey I agree with you. when it's all over I guess he will give us an opinion if he wants us to have one.  The press is going to let him slide on EVERYTHING cu's anyone says anything neg about his policy that's it they are racist.  we all gotta walk on eggshells and hope he don't do anything Stupid.|`|7y7t04Vsaa	I think he is a cool guy for Americans to have as their president and I think he will do a good job. You will just have to wait and see. I am sure it will be fine. Better than that sh*t you had in there prior to him.|`|fQiiuwlHaa	I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... OBAMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|uZTzird4aa	ummm theres a lot i dont agree with, and he wouldnt exactly have been my first choice, but what can i do? He's president, and i wish him the best.|`|w1IF79vJaa	shouldnt this be in the politics section? (not trying to be rude. sry)<br>  <br>  idk obama like that. so i cant really say. i just hope he does good for us like he promised.|`|BMYOukx5aa	I don't like him, not trustworthy and I do not believe in his morality views or ethics|`|NS3BxXEmaa	to soon to say he has not even done a year yet give him a chance he trying to fix Bushes mess that he left for obama|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	He's a hell of a lot better than what we had.

EVEN NOW I am still hearing the continued hypocrisy and rhetoric of the republicans. Republicans lie like its going out of style and people will support these lies just because they don't like Obama, bottom line, Even when the people know they're lying they don't care. THIS IS TRUTH. Obama inherited this mess HE DIDN'T CREATE IT!!! People talk and talk and they have no REAL solutions for the economy. If there was a solution, the republicans would've taken care of it before Obama got into office. But Bush left us in such a DEEEPPPP mess the choices that are made will not make everyone happy BOTTOM LINE!! <br>  <br>  People like Rush Limbaugh spew lies and hate. That's a fact and the people that listen to him know it also. He's a sexist, separatist, racist and former drug addict that America is paying 100 million a year. (I have quotes and links to prove it) And people wanna follow and listen to him? OKKK. To say you want the president to fail means you want this country to fail which to me is selfish, stupid and ignorant. If you don't agree with his views FINE!! But to want America to fail? If Obama fails so do we b/c Bush failed and look at where we're at. Even tho I don't like Bush, I'd rather he was successful in developing America into more of a superpower. America is suffering and if it makes republicans feel good to see America fail just to prove a sick point, then who really has the people's interests at heart? It's all politics to them and they could care less about the American people. To the republicans the American people are mere puppets. It's either their way or we can all go to hell if we don't agree. <br>  <br>  ALL politicians aren't perfect, this is true including Obama. But to slam him for trying his best to fix Bush's mess, well what can you say. I guess hate is much deeper than the greater good. Forget about race please. This shouldn't be a thing about race (b/c for some ppl its a factor)  People need to just wish for the best. Period.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bill Clinton REDUCED our debt when he was in office. Let's clear that up and not spread lies about that. If you need facts on that, let me know. Even the republicans acknowledge this FACT.|`|0Ugh0amOaa	i like him. and p.s. all politicians are untrustworthy. one day you'll get used to presidents that aren't white. maybe that's why you dont trust him, because this is new. people dont like change.|`|fJichSMhaa	i love obama i thinks he'll be a great president and will make a lot of improvements to america, im just happy they got rid of george bush FINALLY.|`|3S3XjvYcaa	"He's not trustworthy"<br>  Prove it...<br>  <br>  I think hes a smart guy, he graduated from Harvard, and his VP is not Sarah Palin.

nE64Hn8Paa	Short answer - you can't.<br>  <br>  Longer answer - acoustic guitars rely on sound waves and need a microphone to be amplified.  Electro-acoustics use a piezo-transducer or a microphone (or a combination of both) to change those sound waves into an electical circuit. The sound must travel from your strings to your saddle, your saddle to your bridge, your bridge to your soundboard, and your soundboard to the open air for a mic, and from strings to saddle to piezo/bridge.  All of the elements above interact with one another, giving you a warm, very complex tone and sound wave. This complex tone does not play nicely with distortion or other effects.<br>  <br>  Electric guitars use a different way to create sound - the vibration of the strings moves electrons in the pickup's coil, creating a direct connection between the vibration of the strings and the amplifier.  This gives you a much simpler sound wave, and thereby is much more compatible to effects.<br>  <br>  <br>  Acoustic guitars also feature a much higher action (string height) than electrics, heavier strings, and very low sustain.  As a result, the acoustic cannot be played like an electric to begin with. Anything featuring hammer -ons/pull offs, fast playing, effects, ect will be more difficult to do with an acoustic.<br>  <br>  BUT you can buy electric pickups and have them installed in your acoustic.  The problem with this will be the space between the strings and the pickup - the farther, the less output.  The less output, the less distortion.<br>  <br>  The best way to get the sound of an electric - save your cash (which is hard now I know) and get yourself a decent electric guitar.|`|zPraJYmbaa	Absolutly. If you want to sound electric, get an electric. you are going to run into a lot of crazy noise if you try to go that way and you still wont sound electric even if you can clean it up.

There are altogether seven "Masters" who can summon their respective "Servants" from different classes known as Saber, Archer, Rider, Berserker, Lancer, Caster and Assassin. These "Servants" have to hide their names in order not to reveal their weaknesses to the enemies because each one of the servants is an epic hero from earths past. The main character, Shirou Emiya, treat treats Saber just like any other woman and not like a servant which is something that she is not used too. Saber feels that she must fight without any care for what happens to herself, but Shirou, feels the exact opposite. He tries everything to keep her from getting hurt and often times ends up hurting himself in the process.<br>  <br>  Air (fantasy/drama/romance) <br>  <a href="http://justdubs.net/dubs/air.html" rel="nofollow">http://justdubs.net/dubs/air.html</a><br>  <br>  Yukito Kunisaki (also voiced by Vic Mignogna AKA Edward Elric)<br>  is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the "girl in the sky". Yukito comes across a small seaside town where he tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings. Yukito meet three different girls in this town and as he spends more time with them he start to notice that they all have some kind of connection to the "girl in the sky".<br>  <br>  The Show holds true to the air theme as many stories, events, and feelings of the character deal with the sky, flying, or things that move through the air like bubbles. The show is very interesting and deep as every character has to deal with there own complicated relationships and emotional dilemmas.

Yuuji's life was then saved by a girl in a black coat, with Burning Eyes (also known as Shakugan) and flaming red hair holding a long sword. Due to the confusion and chaotic mess Yuuji gotten into, he follows the girl with the flaming red hair and finds out the truth about everything around him. Yuuji find out that the truth is that the people around him have blue flame in their chests are not real people and that he was not a real person.

She's his step sister, which means that they're not related by blood, just by the marriage of Brooke and Ridge.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	spoilers<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  apparently rick is the 'hero' and saves ridge and plays it for all it's worth. i can't stand rick. he is a true snake in the grass and the only reason he wants steffy is to get back at ridge.|`|msUIsv8maa	Ridge is a snob no wonder Rick acts like he does Eric has made Ridge the Saint of the Family all his Life even Thorne was hurt by this as well and told Eric. the great Ridge Forrester HUHhhhhhhh. another Victor Newman.|`|fcPiQDwEaa	Rick is sickening........end of story!|`|d9c0f5c5286294dcbb5ab28de65e8c39aa	Lol rick is such an @ hole. He is so arragant. I am amused the way ridge keeps chasing rick, but I must admit rick teases ridge on purpose. The last shot of the episode ridge was like "pull me up rick" then they close with rick smirking like yeah right. Lol. Ridge gets on my nerves, but I feel his pain.|`|55c73af3c6f525a60d43fcd5ce107087aa	I wish Ridge would fall off the building....|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	No, I don't think so!|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Rick is certainly bold to keep playing this Steffie card at this point and time !  He obviously knew the Army would reject him, so he just built the drama up , which Brooke and Steffie bought, but ridge sure didn't.<br>  Sneaky Rick,,,,  yeah it has to be Ridge this time, just to make it more interesting

VRsFXHvPaa	I went to an Art High School. Everyone always prided themselves that they "were weird". So freakin annoying. every single person wanted more and more and more attention it was ridiculous. Attention whores. that's what they are.<br>  <br>  Then in 12th grade I transfered to a normal public school. Then everyone was like "YOUR weird, your weird your weird." I think every single person is different. everyone likes different things, everyone is different in their own ways.<br>  <br>  I am so freakin sick of this overrated word "weird"<br>  <br>  12, 13, and 14 year olds are obsessed with the word "weird".<br>  <br>  They use it to describe everything.<br>  <br>  Whenever they do something they are embarrassed of, or whenever they want attention, they will call themselves "weird".<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ don't call yourself weird! You look like an idiot! Call yourself and idiot instead! Only others can determine if you are "weird"... even though we have completely lost the meaning of that word. <br>  <br>  I bet you are 13. arn't you. =.=<br>  <br>  weird is like I-lick-my-cat-weird. Not "cool". Just... weird! NOT in a good way! That is the real definition of weird. Not I-wear-out-of-the-ordinary-clothes. Weird is not something to be proud of. You may be different, interesting, but weird is acting slightly mentally insane: to not be doing things that humans as a species should NOT do. You might want to know what words mean before you use them.<br>  <br>  geez someone get this kid a dictionary.<br>  <br>  synonyms: queer, grotesque, unnatural|`|f9sL3WgQaa	nope|`|hFVPEkWjaa	yes i'm super weird lol|`|tIJCQ0XQaa	LOL she's obviously weird too but just doesn't admit it haha<br>  anyway yeah I'm super weird you have no idea...

5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	I remember being where your at now. I was new to jazz and didn't know a thing beyond Miles and Trane. I didn't have a website like this so I called up the local college radio station and begged for some suggestions. I was lucky, because that night the dj had a few of his friends hanging out in the studio with him. They were all yelling out albums, and getting excited about each others suggestions. I was writing them down as fast as I could.<br>  They did me right. Now all these years later, I can pass on the short list version, with my own own approval.<br>  <br>  Here is the list of some classics that are similar to Coltrane. They are mostly from the mid 1960's, a fantastic era in jazz.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Miles Davis Kind of Blue album. It's a great album for a beginner, and it's great even if you've heard a whole lot of jazz. Get it. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Thelonious is another great and important master of jazz. I suggest that you start out with the Monk's Dream album. Don't operate heavy machinery while listening. Monk swings the hardest of any jazz musician, in my little opinion. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  This is the album that really turned me onto jazz. I still enjoy it and respect it. Roland Kirk's Inflated Tear album.<br>  <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Booker Ervin's album called The Freedom Book is completely amazing, from start to finish. The chemistry of the musicians is amazing. <br>  <br>  Grant Green's Matador album is a great album, centered around the guitar playing, although McCoy Tyner is at his best (piano player from Coltrane's band). It's another great album that's easy to like. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Wayne Shorter's album called Speak Like A Child is a great album that you really have to hear. I can't even talk about it. The whole band is amazing. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Herbie Hancock's album, Maiden Voyage is another great and easy to like album. Freddie Hubbard is at his best through the whole album (on trumpet, fluglehorn). It's a concept album, and it really does flow like the sea, as Herbie intended it to. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Horace Silver plays piano with soul. The songs are great and so is the band. Everything works on this album called Song For My Father. It's another easy to like album too. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Oliver Nelson's album called Blues and the Abstract Truth is another classic. It features the great Eric Dolphy. Get it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I think that the jazz of the current scene is some of the best I have ever heard. I live near New York City, and I am lucky enough to be able to hear today's musicians in little intimate places. Today's jazz musicians are VERY creative. Its not popular because its not advertised, and like Frank Zappa said "Most people wouldn't know good music if it hit them over the head". Anyway, here is a short list of musicians/albums that are great, in my opinion, and easy for a beginner to "get".<br>  <br>  Drew Gress- Seven Black Butterflies. This band is amazing. The songs are constantly changing and morphing. I saw this band last night, and they were great. I really think you should hear tis album if you are interested in whats modern in jazz.<br>  <br>  I'm going to stop commenting on each one for the rest of the list. I am only listing the albums which totally blow me away. I don't know if they are good for your tastes, but I do know that if you like this kind of thing, you hear albums that are a complete success at what the artist was trying to create, and in all cases, the albums were motivated to make music that is completely unique and adventerous. <br>  <br>  Scott Colley- Archetiect of the Silent Moment. Excellent.<br>  <br>  John Ellis- Roots Branches and Leaves<br>  <br>  Kurt Rosenwinkel-Deep Song (any album)<br>  <br>  Seamus Blake- Stranger Things Have Happened<br>  <br>  Ried Anderson- Dirty Showtunes<br>  <br>  Ari Hoenig- Inversations<br>  <br>  Charles Lloyd Rabo De Nube<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know too many singers beyond the legends, but I can suggest some classic albums that I know are great.<br>  <br>  Sarah Vaughan- Self titled album, also known as Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown. Great singing and great band. Also get Sarah's Like at Mr. Kelly's album.<br>  <br>  Sheila Jordan- Portrait of Sheila Jordan. Very mellow.<br>  <br>  I promise that my answers are from persoanl experience and that I listen to lots of jazz.<br>  <br>  PS-The best radio station for jazz (BY FAR) is WKCR(.org). Check thier schedule, because sometimes they play other styles of music too.|`|RBW9ZX1iaa	I listen to Coltrane and Davis all the time (there is a reason they are so cliched). If you like them try listening to some richie cole, Cannonball Adderley (a legend and one of my favorites), joshua redmen, dizzy gillepsy, art blakey, herbie hancock, chick corea, kurt elling, and thelonius monk. They are all great great artists that are pretty contemporary. <br>  Btw if you don't have coltrane's "A love supreme" I would suggest getting it.|`|fcrFlFZQaa	Terence Blanchard is an internationally renowned jazz trumpeter, bandleader, composer, arranger, and Golden Globe-nominated film score composer...<br>  ...After performing on soundtracks for Spike Lee movies, including Do the Right Thing and Mo' Better Blues, Lee wanted Blanchard to compose the scores for his films beginning with "Jungle Fever" (1991). Blanchard has written the score for every Spike Lee film since including, Malcolm X, Clockers, Summer of Sam, 25th Hour, Inside Man.|`|7ElQilxmaa	Could try John Mc Goughtlan,Larry Coryell,Pat Methany,Larry Carlton.<br>   Jamie Cullum.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	While i was watching australian idol God told me He would have liked some more folk singing chicks.|`|e97037e29bf6dd323c13e9097d4a5669aa	I very much like Chris Botti. He's a smooth jazz trumpet player, very good.<br>  I also LOVE Herbie Hancock. He's pretty recent and fusion, so it's a little different than the bebop stuff, but its still absolutely amazing. I would suggest the song "And What If I Don't" It's my favorite.

P0Fjh59Eaa	The three princesses all wanted the Prince for themselves, but the one that caught Prince Todd's eye was Princess Marty. Though once she got him she had no idea what to do with him so Princess Blair swooped in, sucker punched Princess Marty into the moat and gallopped away w/Prince Todd for what she thought would be a happy ending.<br>  <br>  Princess Marty spent the rest of her days wallowing in her own misery while Princess Tea's anger festered. <br>  <br>  One night Prince Todd was out w/his buddies at the local pub when Princess Tea spotted them. She made a plan to get Prince Todd away from Princess Blair by pretending to be upset about how Princess Blair was flirting w/the Guardsmen at their father's castle.....which was true, but Princess Tea wasn't upset. <br>  <br>  Prince Todd was devastated and leaned on Tea for support. Princess Blair got wind of what was happening and as soon and Princess Tea and Prince Todd showed up at the castle Princess Blair attacked Princess Tea and a huge fight began. Prince Todd was highly amused and watched w/glee. <br>  Princess Blair and Princess Tea fought all the way to the top of the tower, then in one great kick from Princess Blairs designer slippers Princess Tea fell from the tower window and down down down she fell until SPLAT!<br>  <br>  Princess Blair ratty haired and blooded, wobbled back down the tower stairs to claim her prize, but upon getting to Prince Todd she noticed that same darkly handsome and brooding Guard's man Sir McBaine and he swept her off her feet long enough to distract her from Prince Todd, who at that very moment was weaseling his way back into Princess Marty's good graces. <br>  <br>  Prince Todd tried to kiss Princess Marty but she pushed him away and let out a huge scream, sending Sir McBaine flying down the stairs after her. Princess Blair became enraged and stomped out to the coutryard to find Prince Todd in a heap Sir McBaine standing over him. <br>  Princess Blair rushed to Prince Todd's side all the while accusing Princess Marty of wrong doing while Princess Marty stood indignant as possible...and innocent looking as possible as well. Still through all the ranting and raving Princess Blair was doing she would on occasion look to Sir McBaine and give a smile and a wink, securing her place in the hearts of two men.<br>  <br>  Prince Todd dizzy and confused from the blow to his head from Sir McBaine never noticed and.......well.....you get the picture it just goes and and on w/this guys! LOL

uRSUeFQ9aa	Whew, so much to say here (pops knuckles)<br>  <br>  Saturn has been opposing uranus since october of last year and it will continue to oppose until about april of this year.  Just like the consistant sextile between neptune and pluto (which has been on and off for like the last 80 years), saturn and uranus in opposition will have a more broad affect.  Both are slower moving planets, so naturally it will take longer for the aspect to fade than for most usual aspects (which last about 3 days to a month).  Saturn will turn direct and then will once again oppose uranus in late august of this year, and it will stay opposing until november.  <br>  <br>  Whenever transiting uranus and transiting saturn make any aspect to one another, you can bet some oddities will happen.  Saturn embodies everything the uranus does not; they are total opposites.  So, for two opposites to actually form an opposition seems ironic.  Uranus stands for freedom, saturn is restrictions.  Uranus tears down, saturn gives structure.  Uranus is scientific, saturn is practical.  So, during this time, people may seem like they want freedoms and change so badly, yet they are unwilling to give it to others.  <br>  <br>  Saturn transiting to your ASC/DC axis would likely not be favorable for starting new relationships.  Actually, it is a good time to stand back and see what in your life is falling apart, then try to give foundation to those things you wish to keep, and do away with those you don't.  You may seem more serious and goal-oriented to others at this time.  Ideally, you will work hard and save back some cash for when you will receive some positive jupiter transits or progressions lol.  <br>  <br>  If uranus is transiting, arcing, or progressing to the natal ascedant/descendant axis, we can expect major life changes.  Possibly a change of geographical location, or perhaps a birth or death of someone who has/will been/be a prominent person in your life.  At the most devastating, this could mean a time of being totally flipped upside down.  Maybe things are running smoothly, but then all of a sudden it's as if you cannot hold on to anything.  Things that you once had great control over may be slipping through your fingers.  You also, on a more positive side, may feel like asserting yourself more positively now.  You might venture off and find opportunities now, so even if you feel a bit shaken up, you really should keep an open mind (and an open ear) to things.  <br>  <br>  Of course, you describe yourself as being "conflicted" right now, and that's precisely the kind of thing this transit is doing to lots of people.  In your case it directly affects your ascendant so I would expect even more to happen to your persona and image.  Making new friends might not be bad.......I'd look to some other things for that kind of change.

a090stxGaa	Parts of the movie are based on real life events. Alot of the scenes are actual people just being filmed telling their stories. For instance the guy who is talking about committing suicide. Other scenes are scripted, the cat killing scenes and when they have sex with the girl with down syndrome. So to answer your question it is a mix of scripted scenes and real life documentary.|`|OhSgRYxHaa	I've looked into it and can find no evidence of this film being based on true events. Total fiction and pretty weird fiction at that.
Da3chlUJaa	thats not the mangekyo smart one.....if u pay attention he has to kill naruto to achieve that but he didnt....so dont ask retorical questions|`|AA10622364	Yeah same as the Photo i sent showing Sai with a sharingan!<br>  point is don't believe work of fan only believe the manga & the anime & none else even if it is Masashi him self who did it if it isn't part of the story then it is not true & so this one is.|`|6886ee031548515efd68d5a7264a2014aa	Sasuke does not have mangekyou sharinggan because in order to obtain it he must kill Naruto. He does not want Itachi to have his way so he did not kill Naruto.|`|iuhWFfPraa	first of all, sasuke CANT have the sharingan YET...<br>  unless he gets it the same way kakashi-sempai did...<br>  Second, your url doesnt work. =(<br>  =D|`|l0pZG2Q2aa	He dosen't. He can get it only AFTER killing naruto. He dose complete his sharingan though.|`|vc1K1p1Raa	Sasuke has never had the mangekyou sharingan.<br>  <br>  The Mangekyo Sharingan ( Mangekyō Sharingan; Literally meaning "Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye") is a heightened form of Sharingan. The Mangekyo Sharingan is distinguished from a normal Sharingan through its appearance, which changes the form of the tomoe seal. However, unlike the Sharingan, it has a different appearance between the users, as a kaleidoscope never looks the same when looked through. Kakashi's version is significantly different than Itachi's, as Madara's looks completely different, and his brother's looks different also. Those who have the potential to obtain it must make a great sacrifice in order to obtain it – according to Itachi, they must kill their closest friend. Itachi, Madara, and his brother apparently do in fact do this to obtain the original version, but Kakashi has noted that everyone he cared about had died long before the start of the series, so how he developed his own variant is unknown. The major drawback of the Mangekyo Sharingan is that when it is first activated, it slowly begins to destroy the eyes, until the user becomes completely blind. The only way to regain one's eyesight after losing it would be to steal the eyes of a sibling, combining the two Sharingan to create a new, more powerful, and immortal Mangekyo Sharingan, which prevents blindness and apparently grants immortality.<br>  <br>  In the long history of the Uchiha clan, only a few have been able to obtain the Mangekyo Sharingan, Madara Uchiha being the first, and his brother being the second. At present, there are three people who can use the Mangekyo Sharingan: Itachi, Kakashi, and Madara. According to Itachi though, if his younger brother Sasuke obtained it, the number of people who could handle the Mangekyo Sharingan (including himself) at that time would be three. What this means about Kakashi is unknown.<br>  <br>  Mangekyo Sharingan can release 2 deadly jutsus, the only two known until now are Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. Although these jutsu are extremely devastating, they require an enormous amount of chakra, and also cause immense strain and eventually blindness on the user.<br>  <br>  Itachi Uchiha<br>  <br>  Itachi Uchiha gained the Mangekyo Sharingan by killing his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. With the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi is able to use the two most powerful jutsu of the Uchiha clan. The first is Tsukuyomi, a powerful genjutsu. Upon making eye contact with an opponent, Itachi can use Tsukuyomi to transport them to an illusionary world where days amount to a mere moment in the real world. Because Itachi is in control of this world, he can torture an opponent in any way imaginable, leaving them crippled and in a state of mental collapse, though his limit is 3 days. The second jutsu is Amaterasu. While the jutsu has only been performed offscreen, it is shown to be capable of burning through the strongest of materials by creating a jet-black flame said to be as hot as the sun and capable of burning for seven days and seven nights. Both of these jutsu, however, use massive amounts of chakra and also cause permanent damage to the user's eyesight, as the eyeball itself is engorged in blood and stressed enormously while being used; Itachi himself becomes exhausted if using them both consecutively, and has to deactivate his Sharingan. Soon his ulterior motive is revealed, which would be to steal Sasuke's eyes to awaken his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. During the fight with Itachi and Sasuke, Zetsu has revealed that the "Left Mangekyo" possesses the Tsukuyomi and the "Right Mangekyo" holds Amaterasu. <br>  <br>  Kakashi Hatake<br>  <br>  <br>  Kakashi Hatake developed his own version of the Mangekyo Sharingan during the timeskip. Kakashi uses his to create a localized interdimensional space-time warp, allowing him to target any object and send it to another dimension. The attack requires considerable effort to aim precisely and appears to leave Kakashi's chakra significantly drained; he collapses after using the technique three times in a single day (compared to his other original move, Lightning Blade, which he can use six times a day).<br>  <br>  The appearance of the pupil and tomoe in Kakashi's Mangekyo Sharingan differ from that of Itachi's; Kakashi's looks more like a pinwheel. Before this was shown, it was thought that one had to kill their best friend to acquire the Mangekyo Sharingan. Given that Kakashi is unlikely to do this, due in part to his own admittance that everyone close to him is already dead, the means behind its development and the actual meaning of the "requirement" are currently unknown.<br>  <br>  The difference in both look and abilities of Kakashi's and Itachi's Mangekyo Sharingan suggests that each Mangekyo Sharingan's look and abilities differ from one user to another. <br>  <br>  I will star this question.<br>  This took a while but i hope it helps you.|`|oou9hzU3aa	He still dose not have mangekyou sharingan.|`|y5RZPNhIaa	He doesn't.<br>  <br>  Sasuke doesn't have the mangekyou sharingan. He didn't kill his best friend Naruto. To get the mangekyou sharingan you have to kill your best friend and Sasuke didn't do that. That's why he went seeking power from Orochimaru,but as we saw with Kakashi,Kakashi was able to unlock the mangekyou sharingan without killing his best friend. Its possible he did it through training,also the death of Obito could of helped him unlocking it.<br>  <br>  The closet thing Sasuke has to the mangekyou sharingan is the sharingan level 3,which can predict a persons movements.<br>  <br>  Naruto Rocks!!!!!

I can't wait till Sonny finds out, he is going to be the biggest idiot in PC!|`|sgHvnxe2aa	Yes, that will be interesting when Sonny's son arrives.....<br>  <br>  The first two answers you got so far are very interesting....Oh wow, <br>  Maxi and Sonny's son....I can only imagine that...and what about poor<br>  Spinelli...He has feelings for Maxi....Will she just forget all about him?<br>  <br>  The other day when Carly, Claudia, Kate, and Olivia were all there in the hospital hallway or whatever and Sonny walked in on them...<br>  Ex wife, current wife, ex-fiance and almost wife, and her cousin who has his son and he doesn't know....Ohhh my...and sonny doesn't know<br>  THAT part, let alone what Kate has on Claudia....even though she and<br>  carly both hate claudia, they hate each other as well.....but I have to root for Carly, even though I didn't used to like her at all and I totally HATED the idea of her being with Sonny - when she was being played<br>  by Sarah Brown....She does better as Claudia....and so what WOULD have happened if Kate hadn't been shot and she and Sonny would be married now...instead of Sonny and Claudia....Or would they????????|`|M1ymLE9Paa	Amen sister!  I'm so tired of watching Claudia search for these stupid dvd's and then watch them in public places where anyone could see or hear.  I'm tired of Kate barging into a house that doesn't belong to her, playing the shrew.  Personally, I just want the secret to come out so we can move past it.  But if they want it to stay a secret then yes, let's concentrate on some other storylines until they are ready to move forward w/having the secret revealed.  I'm tired of secrets that aren't really secrets.  Its so annoying.|`|AA11261694	i love the story cuz i love claudia she is my favorite charcter i like kate and sonny to|`|5LxpvXSmaa	Agreed! It has gotten old real fast and they need to pick up the steam on this and pronto! Dante's arrival should be interesting and can you see Maxi making a play? Max will have a fit!|`|aQCF1pqIaa	I soooo agree!! If Kate is so determined to tell Sonny some great secret, why not tell him about Dante!?!? I think they will def. have Michael wake up at some point and then lets go back and have him find out Claudia had something to do with the shooting but for now, lets let is rest!!! I'm sick of the storyline and wish we could see something new for a little while!|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	I agree that they need to pick up the pace a little here! I think Kate should just tell Sonny. I would! After all, since when has Sonny ever needed proof. And the proof is all over his house.  I think Kate just needs to plant a little seed of doubt, and his paranoia will take it from there!|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Totally agree with you. I am so sick of Claudia and her watching them over and over again, you know Sonny wont find out until Sarah Brown wants to leave the show.|`|AA11573893	I agree about the storyline but think if Carly finds out about Dante she will get jealous and detour her attention away from Jax again

Then your moon sagittarius...They are nice people as well...I have a bestfriend that is a sagittarius.<br>  Then your ascendant is libra..that's the mask you show people.So people might think you are passionate about beauty, emotional at times, and aloof too. <br>  <br>  Those are the 3 main sign that is your personality.

Wi0LBsVbaa	It's just your sense of harmony. The instability of romantic and the dissonance of modern don't appeal to you. They do reflect increasingly stressful states of consciousness. This can affect you. So you probably prefer the more tonal music for the more calm mental effects it has. It's a country walk, as opposed to the later more industrially developed music. <br>  There are many reasons for this preference, the two extreme are either you are very calm and centered, or not, and the music helps calm and center you.<br>  This is my theory based in my experience, as I feel similarly about much modern classical. I have really given it a chance, I do like Alban Berg even, but much of modern is stressful. I can see the art of it, understand that it takes genius to express such stress-filled states of consciousness, but it runs contrary to my taste.<br>  Music does have an effect on the listener. You can look at the general public and see that the music someone chooses is connected to their personality. <br>  As long as you give it a chance, you are in the intellectually superior category. <br>  As for what I see in it; some is expressed above. As for romantic, it is a language. the language is useful for expressing the dramatic emotions in life. The story of the hero and the lover, there is no program for even a late Mozart Symphony, no story in a Bach suite. But they imposed programs on symphonies in the late 1800s.<br>  I find the the music of Brahms, Bruckner, and Sibelius include the trials of life and the spirit to transcend them. I do not listen to Chopin or Rachmaninov, so it's a musical version of liking adventure films and passing on romantic dramas.<br>  If it's the harmonic language that puts you off, I am wondering where you go up to. If you didn't really like romantic you would like Beethoven's first two symphonies, (the 8th is debatable), and not the rest. It's unlikely, but possible. I'm wondering if you like Mendelsohnn or Schumann, or Berwald? Well, I would recommend, in any case, to  slowly get accustomed to the language, if you really want to see the beauty I see. But it really is fine to like what you like, if that's what you like. Much better than liking nothing.<br>  Fot me, modern music is like psycological thrillers, or even horror movies. The semitone tone cluster, either softly sustained up high, or in a  menacing crescendo, medium range, has no better stage than those movies, and would be obviously be out of place elsewhere.<br>  That's an explanation, but it probably doesn't help you out.|`|DMpVSHvXaa	What appeals to me in modernist music is basically the same things that appeal to me in other music (which are hard to put into words: things to do with appreciating its formal structure (music as architecture :) ) , ingenious use of the resources available to the composer, and emotional expressive, which I can pick up in music in ways that I don't have a hope of achieving with human emotional expression), but expressed in different terms. <br>  <br>  Have you listened to much modernist music? If you haven't, it can be hard to get anything out of it: you need to learn to speak its language. If you come to it with the exact same expectations as you'd bring to the Classical and Baroque styles of music, it won't do much for you.|`|CrAwmz65aa	In "The Emperor's New Clothes," the Royal Weavers pull a fast one.  They announce that anyone who can't see the emperor's new clothes is stupid.  Nobody likes to be called stupid, so everyone pretended to see the emperor's new clothes.<br>  <br>  Proponents of atonal music pull the same trick on us.  They tell us stories of audiences rejecting musical innovations throughout music history, point out that those audiences are laughed at today, and warn us that future generations will laugh at us unless we accept atonal music.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, all they have to go on is inductive reasoning.  You can't get conclusive evidence from inductive reasoning.  Just because the Baroque style, the Classical style, and the Romantic style were eventually accepted doesn't prove that atonal music will eventually be accepted.<br>  <br>  In fact, we may have tested atonal music long enough already.  It has been a full century since Schonberg embarked on his marvy scheme.  It took a while for the audience to accept the English horn solo in the Franck symphony, but it did not take a hundred years.  It took a while for the audience to accept the parallel fifths in La Boheme, but it did not take a hundred years.  A hundred years was long enough for the late Baroque and early Classical eras to take place!<br>  <br>  It does not even seem that atonal composers themselves appreciate atonal music.  One of my music professors has asked several atonal composers what they listen to at home.  The vast majority of his respondents listen to harmonious and melodious music at home.  There were more Beatle fans than atonal music fans in his sample.  Just as the Royal Weavers could not see their own clothes, atonal composers cannot hear their own music. <br>  <br>  Preference for tonal music is intercultural.  The music of isolated cultures abounds with pentatones and heptatones, but not with atone.  The preference is even interspecific.  Lab rats react more favorably to Johann Strauss than to Schonberg.  If we ever meet any extraterrestrials, we might even find the difference to be interplanetary.  <br>  <br>  John Williams seems to think so.|`|9NBH9DDcaa	I agree with the other answers on here, but would like to approach it a different way. Let me ask you a question: do you like modern art? You know, paintings by Picasso, Dali, Kandinsky, etc. It's pretty much the same difference between the Renaissance and Baroque art styles versus Romantic and modern art styles. If you do find modern art interesting, that may help you appreciate modern music more by approaching it in a different mindset. If you don't, then no big deal. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes; I don't believe that it's a form of "intellectual failing" by any chance.|`|NJaZBgDwaa	Sorry cant offer an explanation...<br>  <br>  I like baroque music, but also classical and romantic. Modernist music pisses me off as much as hip hop but hey, its just personal opinion and preferance.<br>  <br>  I do like romantic music, because it has more expression than classical or baroque music... that was the whole idea of the period, expression. Yet, I will contradict myself and say I like baroque music more!|`|ThKkn5fKaa	I think that the hardest thing for people to wrap their ears around in modern music is the concept of melody.  Until that point, western art music had always had clearly defined tunes and melodies.  But in a lot of modern music, the overall sound is more important than a supposed melody.  It's a very difficult concept to get used to.

I can see how a casual viewer of Star wars might not make that distinction.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Episode III was filmed in 2004 - 2005.  Ahsoka was created in 2007 to be an additional character for The Clone Wars.  So it's definitely not meant to be the same person.  Sorry to deflate your discovery.  But keep watching.  There ARE other subtle links to previously established characters.<br>  <br>  For example: Admiral Yularen who Anakin and Obi-Wan often work with is in the original Star Wars movie.  He's in the scene where Tarkin and Vader are talking to a bunch of Imperial Officers in the Death Star conference room.  He's one of the silent ones with a mustache and light grey uniform.<br>  <br>  Keep looking and you can find more.|`|5EtiRi2yaa	Itr'ws not her.

I don't think it's Master Luminara or Bariss Offee. I'm sorry can't think of who you saw but it's not her. And it's not who's in Phantom Menace but her cousin. She's a Jedi Master on the council.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Ashoka was actually invented long after Episode 3 was finished.  The credit I think says something like...Jedi on Speeder bike.

rV04aFyVaa	Dear Lexus,<br>  Wanting to be a famous singer is a popular and exciting goal, and if you have the talent to back it up, who knows what you can achieve! I too am a young singer (but with a LOT of experience), so several of these tips are based on my experiences.<br>  - Can you give me tip on how to be a great singer?<br>  * I have five tips<br>  1. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! You know what they say, "practice makes perfect!"<br>  2. Take up all opportunities you get to perform. Join your school's or church's choir, audition for the school musical, compete in local singing contests and talent shows (that's how Avril Lavigne rose to fame), audition for local theater productions (that's how Hillary Duff got discovered), sing the national anthem at local baseball games, etc. You never know who could be watching you!<br>  3. You might want to consider taking voice lessons, no matter how much experience you have. Even the top singers in the world, such as Christina Aguilera, take voice lessons regularly to keep their voices in shape. If you cannot read music or play the piano or keyboard at the most basic level, you should learn that too.<br>  4. Promote yourself. Tell people that you want to be a singer. You never know who might have a relative in the business, or about a great singing contest you could enter.<br>  5. Don't give up on finding your voice!<br>  - Can you give me tips on how to write a song?<br>  * I'm not a songwriter myself, but there are several online courses and daily songwriting tip sites on songwriting. Just Google "tips on writing a song" or something similar to it, and look around at the great tips!<br>  - What's the easiest way to learn how to play the guitar?<br>  * First, buy a guitar and find a teacher. If your school gives guitar lessons, be sure to sign up for them.<br>  - Can you record a song with your computer? [dumb question]<br>  * There is a bunch of home recording software you could buy at local retail or computer stores. But without one of these, you can't really record a song. And there's no such thing as a dumb question.<br>  - Are 12 year olds allowed to sing songs at restaurant's, etc.?<br>  * Depending on where you live, you may or may not be able to. For example if a twelve year old singer like you lived in Massachusetts, they would need a special permit to work in entertainment. The same may apply for which state or province you live in, but it would be best to check your state's or province's Department of Labor website.<br>  - Can you make a demi CD with your computer? [another dumb question i know!]<br>  * Provided you have the special software I mentioned in an earlier question, you probably can. I wouldn't know, however, I don't own one.<br>  - How can you score a good record deal?<br>  * Simply put, keep performing and practicing. When a talent agent does discover you, you might start at the grassroots but still receive money. If the talent agent is affiliated with a record company, you might get a record deal with the talent agent.<br>  - Can you make your own "home recording studio"?<br>  * Actually building one costs quite a pretty penny, with all the technology and special way the studio is put up. But if you mean using that recording software, it'll cost WAY less.<br>  - I want to create a song, and once it's done I'm going to tell my mom [for the third time] I want to be a singer. Is that a good idea?<br>  * I personally think that's a good idea. Tell her you want to be a singer, then show her the song to prove that you're serious about achieving your dream of fame.<br>  <br>  *Other tips for people to take you seriously in the music biz:<br>  1. Create a resume. It should be no more than a page long, and say your singing experience. Put everything, from joining the school choir to extraordinary opportunities. Also be sure to include your phone number or e-mail address so the people holding the audition can tell you if the audition was successful. It is also important to get a headshot (picture of your face covering a whole 8-1/2" by 11" sheet of paper) and put your resume on the back. Your headshot is so the people holding the audition can recognize you when you walk in for the first day of your work. If your appearance changes in any way, like say you get glasses, be sure to get a new headshot.<br>  <br>  2. Don't take rejections personally. If you were really close, but just didn't do well enough (even if you gave your all), just keep going and when an opportunity hits next time, go for it. And considering that you're only twelve, you might get rejected because of age. For example, when actress/singer Nikki Blonsky auditioned to be Tracy in the Broadway version of Hairspray when she was sixteen, she was turned down because she was too young. Also remember that rejections can make you stronger, because you know you need to get better to get what you're auditioning for. You get better, and later on when a similar opportunity comes you do well enough to get whatever it is.<br>  3. Don't give up!<br>  <br>  Also, you don't need to learn how to play several instruments in order to g|`|I0E52QSraa	This is something I've been working on as well, but I'm 18.<br>  <br>  *Maybe join a choir at your school? This is good for anyone hoping to sing, you'll learn a lot about your vocal range and how to control your voice.<br>  *Writing lyrics can be difficult for some, but comes easy to others. I suggest just writing what you feel.<br>  *Try looking up lessons on youtube or ultimate-guitar.com<br>  *If you are wanting to record your own music try starting off with a program like Audacity, which is free. <br>  *When it comes to performing, it just depends on the policies of that particular place. <br>  *You can do this with several programs, such as Audacity. <br>  *Getting a record deal is the hardest part of becoming a musician. Just try to get your music out there (youtube, myspace, ect.) and hope it works<br>  *Once again, go with something simple like Audacity<br>  *Finding people who will support you is very important, so yes. I'd say its a very good idea. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

ebb4b810f34245706f791aeb50bec63aaa	If you mean on DVD it won't be until August or September at the earliest.  Season 6 still hasn't finished airing yet. The season finale will be sometime in May.  The last 3 seasons were released on DVD 1-2 weeks before the premiere of the next season so the Season 6 DVD will most likely come out just before Season 7 starts as well.

ogrnWVDKaa	I can't stress this enough, the most important thing to do is NETWORK. Go to local live music spots, get to know people who book gigs, other musicians, owners of clubs etc.  <br>   <br>  99% of people get noticed as a result of knowing somebody or somebody who knows someone else.|`|4wkIOVDoaa	Record lablels are going bankrupt silly girls....they won't even talk to people like myself who have been doing gigs for a few years and I have a professional indie album out. It's not an easy business.<br>  <br>  Here's some advice that I was told. Get good at what you do so...write good songs and learn how to write better songs by reading books. If you play an instrument take lessons and practice.  Then start getting gigs. They'll be small and they WON'T pay anything....who cares you're playing for an audience. It'll help also so you can get over being nervous and actually entertain the crowd. If you have a song or two that everyone loves (not family or friends...real fans like strangers who don't need to be nice to you)....then you can record a demo for pretty cheap nowadays.<br>  <br>  The odds of making it famous are slim but you could become well known in the city you live in which will take a few years.

However, Reed's closeness to Upton sparks jealousy, and she eventually becomes the target of several stunts, ranging from harmless to dangerous.<br>  <br>  And the one on the back of the book...<br>  <br>  Paradise awaits.... <br>  <br>  Now that Cheyenne's murderer has been revealed and Reed knows the truth about who's been stalking her, she's ready to leave the heartache and turmoil of last semester behind.

ScbEzhKiaa	This is more about opinion but there are a few that I can name right away. The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The original Amityville Horror; (I hope I spelled that right). A Nightmare on Elm St., The Descent, High Tension, Wolf Creek, Pet Semetary, Cabin Fever and I could just go on. I like horror movies that aren't terribly predictable like all of the Fri. the 13th movies, Halloweens, and pretty much all vampire movies, but aren't just idiotic crap like Land of the Dead, Diary of the Dead, and Wrong Turn. Horror should be just that-Horror.|`|4THwFGjUaa	Mirrors|`|maUst1Lsaa	Not specifically a horror movie but my ex was into highschool musical movies.

XiYLKF8Saa	By any chance you're not using that 2.0 crap are you? If you are switch back to 1.0.. If that doesn't work, erase the codes on your page them repost them on your profile and make sure you copy the whole code. That's the best thing I can tell you.|`|pTERJdzQaa	I think that it depends whether you have Myspace 1.0 or 2.0, the layouts have to be different to show for the version you have.<br>  <br>  You can make a layout that you can alternate from 1.0 or 2.0 format by going here: <a href="http://www.coolchaser.com/layout/create" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolchaser.com/layout/create</a><br>  <br>  To make your own layout from scratch go here: <a href="http://www.coolchaser.com/themes/create2" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolchaser.com/themes/create2</a><br>  <br>  Tip: There is a Myspace category on Y!A to, you can try posting this same question there and you might get more results and answers.

Fads don't just come along, they're created and reemmerged by media and business.  Look at who the biggest stars are and what made them great, then look at todays stars, are they truely original like the late Steve Irwin, or are they cheap reproductions for the latest generation like britany, LLohan,  The original Icons like Bette Davis and Marilyn monroe were built by the media, but they had their own  touch that really made them stand out  once they were known.<br>  <br>   You might consider Maddona,  she was a monroe copy, but once she was there she went her own way and achieved a icon status.  But one thing you can explore is what made these people famous, what did Nicole Ritchie do to be known other than being selfish stupid and rich because of her Icon Father?  <br>  <br>   Lohan, well she's worked at it a long time, and she still has potenial to become an icon her own as she's not copying anyone yet. she's working, doing her thing, using the Media to make her name.  <br>  <br>  Compare Gwin Stefani and Monroe,  there's still distinct similarities there, Yet Stefani is branched off trying to stay in that main stream, the media which will make $ <br>   <br>  So the cultural "norm"  isn't really a norm, it's a standard by which media makes it judgements on what it thinks will make the most $.|`|AA11850523	Bette and Marilyn died|`|6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	Because class and style have been replaced by skankiness and stupidity.|`|AA12273790	I dont think that these girls(altough i can stand them as a whole) are necessarily that much worse.

It's off the Dysfunction album, it's the hidden track about 11 or so minutes after the last song. Its very easy and sounds great when sung along to.<br>  <br>  Pardon Me(acoustic version) by Incubus is also a good one to play. Times Like These(acoustic version) by Foo Fighters has some easy chords to learn. The first song I learned to play on the acoustic was Put Your Lights On by Santana ft. Everlast. It has some of the base chords you need to know as well as being a beautiful song when played.<br>  <br>  Also if your up for a challenge and can do a few chords I would look into the song Hurt by Johnny Cash (or you can do the version that Kermit the frog did which i prefer to play.....seriously look it up on youtube) its challenging if your not familiar with the chords but its such a great song. Personally one of my favorites to perform. <br>  <br>  The intro's to Fade to Black and One both by Metallica are fun. You can't go wrong with learning any of these songs.

This is because they are still young, still in their teenage years and are growing into adults. When they become more and more famous and meet more people, are they still going to be very in love with each other?<br>  <br>  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Plus, at their ages right now, they are considered young. They wouldn't know yet about what type of person suits them or what are they looking for in a partner.<br>  <br>  If they think they are going to get married and have plans, that is plain foolish.

cQUaEIjeaa	Um, there's probably (hopefully too lol) gonna be a fourth season, seeing as how the anime follows a set of novels that are still being written. the next one if memory serves will be Dancing very Merry Christmas, and then Continuing On My Own, Burning one man force, etc. <br>  <br>  And overload is just a spoof manga that was created - doesn't really go along the story line.|`|JgCGpQaxaa	Are they currently in the process of making a fourth season? No.<br>  <br>  Will they eventually make one? It is very highly probable. Shouji Gatou talked about making a fourth, and because the way TSR left so many things unresolved, I wouldn't be surprised if a fourth season was released late next year.<br>  <br>  However, you have to realize that the guys who are making Full Metal Panic (KyoAni) have a lot on their plate right now (Haruhi and CLANNAD), and they aren't really that big of a company. Plus they really need to wait until the novel ends so they can make a good solid season.|`|wmp0Yy6Maa	I've never heard of a 4th season<br>  I've just heard of<br>  <br>  1: first raid<br>  <br>  2: fumoffu<br>  <br>  3: second raid<br>  <br>  I'm a full metal panic fan myself lol

OhSgRYxHaa	Its Lil Boosie with the song Say Round.
mDsVCJkbaa	I just saw the movie and thought it was wonderful, despite a few minor inaccuracies.  I do have to disagree with enbonfoy:  Unlike her sister, who came to be called "Bloody Mary" for killing hundreds of Protestant believers..... Elizabeth did not execute those of opposing beliefs.  When Elizabeth l first became queen, some of her ministers encouraged her to execute Catholics who refused to convert, but she refused and was only willing to execute heretics who tried to overthrow her. This included Mary, Queen of Scots, who was put to death only after it was proved beyond doubt that she had been treasonous.  This was shown accurately in the movie.|`|OhSgRYxHaa	Like many Hollywood films it takes a historical period and tries to create a money making opportunity out of it.  Yes Elizabeth existed but queen who supported religious freedom. As she executed almost every catholic in the country I doubt it. Yes Raleigh existed but lover of the queen. Lets see she executed him as well. The Spaniards speak in modern day spanish not period spanish and thats only a few of the inacccuracies.<br>  <br>  All this film is is a Cate Blanchett career move designed to make money by trading on the success of the first movie. Unfortunately whilst Die Hard 2 was nearly as good as Die Hard 1, Elizabeth 2 is just boring.
OhSgRYxHaa	Its the chinese word for Courage. She also has the sanskrit word Shreya on her neck and the sanskrit word Aum on her lower back.

3bf7f1ea17d4cb2fe3551899b0bc29feaa	try simple exercises like holding a note for a while and trying to keep it the same, that will help your control and note holding skills. also try different patterns like long short long long short on different notes, and try scales, lots of scales. also i would try to sing my favorite songs, that will make more fun when trying to improve|`|vALEURm8aa	Drink a ton of water! Staying hydrated it the most important part. If you have a piano, sing scales with your voice while going up and down the piano. Join choir in school. That's the best way to get free training.|`|6gzb9zluaa	as a professional singer myself, i know from experience that singing scales { from your lowest notes to your highest notes all the way up and back down again two times a day} will strengthen your voice at a good rate. dont strain though. to start out never sing at reeally highs or reeally lows. strengthen the ones that come easy to you first and work your way up. also, just sing ALOT. it will build the muscles naturally that vibrate your vocal folds/cords. i also suggest the book " How To Sing" by Lilli Lehman if there is any way you can get ahold of it. P.S drink lots of water and warm tea!!:) to hear my work and see my qualifications and proof that this advice works, go to myspace.com/superstarrobertellis and hear for yourself!!<br>  Best Wishes,<br>  Robert Ellis

Chuck Berry freely admits that's all he heard on the radio growing up, which is why "Maybelline", "No Particular Place To Go" and other songs sound a bit rockabilly. Ike Turner criticized Chuck as "not really being rock and roll". <br>  <br>  Chuck and Buddy both were unafraid to use different approaches. Chuck's "You Never Can Tell" would be a real head scratcher for a novice, as would Buddy's "Well All Right."<br>  <br>  In the end though, what would likely suit you best is total immersion in both of them. Lots of listening. Two or three songs of each, then switch to the other.|`|2vzj65Kfaa	c'mon now, we can't be doing your homework for you.|`|mxjT0o58aa	Man what school do you go to?

Pure head voice is 'white' and sounds disgusting.<br>  <br>  Being your own critic, I say that it is good. it is a sign that you are willing to strive even further for a nicer voice. breaking habits isn't easy, but it will be great once you are free of them.|`|angTzfV2aa	Yep your using you head voice obviously! well done! cant believe you taught yourself thats good going!
bmwR7RdMaa	she was a participant in big brother 2007 in UK and became the most hated celebrity when she made racist marks over a fellow contestant who was an Indian.<br>  She's a model<br>  well here's the more detailed one<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Goody" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Goody</a>

pTERJdzQaa	Yeah, Dawn actually does get depressed when she loses a Pokemon contest(especially when she started out and she always lost contest ribbons) and she did have a low self-esteem.<br>  <br>  Although she was not depressed and she was very happy when she defeated May and won the Wallace Cup, Dawn's Piplup defeated May's Glaceon in the finals.<br>  <br>   You can find the episode here: <a href="http://www.pokemonepisodes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pokemonepisodes.com</a><br>  <br>  All the episodes are in english.<br>  <br>  Dawn is so Awesome:D<br>  She is my favorite female pokemon trainer!!!|`|XNzj7b7Taa	imm sure she'll get over it<br>  she might have lost thw ribbon|`|tyWTs4xQaa	In the beginning Dawn was very confident. Then she loses some tournaments and wins some battle. She struggles with her self esteem a little. Then becomes over confident. Then she finally works diligently at training, and I guess her self esteem.
EyKmEptVaa	Maybe they are waiting for ACTUAL facts and not speculation and rumors.Why isn't anyone protesting the thousands upon thousands of cases of domestic violence and violence in general that occurs everyday in this country that involves men,women and children that are not celebrities??|`|oNIIzLwHaa	what is there to protest? its not like hes singing about hitting or objectifying women. i think most of the public is against brown on this (radio stations taking him out of rotation, sponsors dropping him), so they dont need to protest. the law will take care of the rest|`|Uu0ROfuPaa	I don't understand why radio stations aren't playing his music... that has nothing to do with this situation<br>  <br>  I'm in ny and they're actually playing it more|`|JUEkTETAaa	in al we still play it|`|7lYGXzcTaa	Funny how feminists were marching on the Duke campus with signs that said "CASTRATE", while having zero information about the lacrosse players or the truth during that scandal. The fact is, the black or minority struggle trumps feminism, even to a feminist. It's why the average college feminist chick will cry all day about sexism and the patriarchy, then drive off in a car paid for by daddy bumping 50 cent or any random rapper telling hos to "shut up and suck a dick".<br>  <br>  Feminists are hilarious...|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	cuz they dont havr boths sides tio the story, when he told her her was sick of tryin to reassure her of of his love 4 her, she slapped him &thru the lamborghini keys out the door &thats when i t esclated 2 them striking each other& him grabbing her by the throat, this caused her to exit the car, call 911 * he zoomed off leaving her there cuz he was all pissed. they were drinking at the grammy parties w/him looking & talking 2 other girls. she got mad at him 4 it, and he said it was all 'bisniess" rhinna then yelled "im your busniess" & thats what started the whole argument.|`|k39bNUgeaa	well almost every radio station in america isn't playing his music<br>  <br>  I live in alabama.

00065523689897d7479d3d1a6c534b20aa	The first one I believe is "Wait Until Dark."  It was made in 1967 with Audrey Hepburn and Efrem Zimbalist Jr(FBI).. ^_^<br>  Hepburn was nominated for both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress, and Zimbalist was nominated for a Globe in the supporting category.<br>  <br>  A blind woman plays a deadly game of survival.<br>  Susie's husband is asked to hold a doll for a woman as they get off an airplane. She disappears. Mike and Carlino are small time hoods who find the woman's body in Susie's apartment, placed there by her partner, Harry Rote. Susie's blindness is the key to them searching the apartment for the doll that contains smuggled drugs. Mike pretends to be an old friend of Susie's husband while her husband is away and together the crooks invent a story of a police investigation of her husband that only the discovery of the now missing doll can save him from.<br>  <br>  I believe the other movie is The Game(1997) with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. <br>  <br>  Plot: It is millionaire banker Nicholas Van Orton’s birthday. For the first time in several years he meets up with his brother Conrad, a former drug addict who says that he now has his life sorted out. For his birthday present, Conrad gives Nicholas an invite to the mysterious organization Consumer Recreation Services. CRS promises to turn the lives of participants into a game. Nicholas is initially sceptical about CRS until he overhears other clients saying how their experience has changed their lives. Nicholas joins up but immediately after his life is turned upside down.|`|NhBYONjTaa	some kind of twilight type movie or something???

d36da7bbff05d23acceb010110cea63eaa	Your question made me laugh, even though I've been a pretty die hard fan of Nanny Jo's for several years.  There are times when I want to see her say to the parents, " Your kids are too messed up for me to handle them - you need to send them to boot camp!" Or I'd love to see one episode where she does her best and in the end the family is exactly where it was when she came in. And are defiant. But for the most part, people wouldn't support killing her. Now, Tom Arnold of "My Big RedNeck Wedding" is another matter altogether.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	I don't think there's episodes where the parents die (dramatic much?) but they do not put all of the episodes they film on tv because not all of the families make such a transition.  It usually has to do with the parents not coming around to what the nannies are doing but it does happen.|`|Ju5sEcblaa	yah.its super nanny!!!|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	Because Super Nanny would smack that kid down first|`|AA12158282	haha like cartman . but then they could bring in the dog whisperer|`|m703KlwGaa	I don't think super-nanny wants to die... :O!|`|WtVHEUZQaa	super nanny probably wouldnt come if it was that bad<br>  and if she didint know anf found otu during her vistit, they prbably wouldnt shwo the eposode|`|nd5w7v4saa	First off, i love that show.<br>  <br>  And, in every episode she ends up whipping them back into shape.<br>  i agree i want to see some crazy kid,<br>  haha. we should write in.<br>  <br>  : ]|`|yxZxfnNFaa	i would just laugh, shortly after i would realise i am one of them kids.<br>  <br>  DOWN WITH THE SUPER NANNY.|`|0UqOwLCjaa	Then he would be too terrible for Super Nanny to handle.|`|hJ5lQXehaa	Sounds like Eric Cartman.|`|rrrE1MA9aa	Contact Cesar Milan.

Z0lEv4Dzaa	I taught myself too and I started playing at the age of 12. I'm 20 now.<br>  My advice is that you get a book of piano exercises like HANON and Chopin Etudes.<br>  <br>  Start with HANON. Exercises may not sound very good because they are only made to strengthen and to have evenness in both of our hands. If you really want to play fast and have strong fingers, I suggest that you play exercises religiously everyday. <br>  <br>  HANON books has 60 i think, exercises to give independence on all our five fingers. If you practice the exercises at least 2hours a day, I'm really sure that you'll become very good. <br>  <br>  Try the Bertini book to practice sight reading and technique.<br>  <br>  You can also try different books about ETudes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Vv7IvSEjaa	If you can read music, buy the HANON exercises. It'll help you with fingering, touch and flexibility.<br>  <br>  If playing by ear, listen critically. When playing, play in strict time and use ALL your fingers.|`|DgCRryxFaa	I assume you can read music.  Make sure you are playing scales, arpeggios, cadences, etc. (You can buy a scales book if you need help.) Hanon exercises will help you with technique.  Sightread a lot.  Pay attention to all fingerings.  Make sure you are always playing with the correct hand position (curved fingers, playing on your tips, thumb on its side) so you don't damage your hands.|`|B70u55dAaa	keep time<br>  honesty<br>  listen|`|IYQH7DP0aa	listen for mistakes, enjoy your music, do it a lot
sc4BtGxGaa	People ask all the time about their *level*.  You need to enter an assessment or competition to find out- and THOSE pieces (not *songs!!!) are NOT going to do it. The works pre-determined to qualify at a certain level are chosen by a panel, and come from recognized literature. The level examination also requires you to play scales in a certain structured pattern or rhythm, and also to sight-read a work that is composed according to specific rubrics.  <br>  <br>  Not all the works for these competition are classical, but they ARE accepted literature composed for that instrument.  Sorry - put *pop slop* is NOT going to qualify, or ever be taken seriously for these assessment.  Enjoy playing it - just like you enjoy eating potato chips - NO NUTRITION there whatsoever.

I have trouble finding anything but praise for it.<br>  <br>  The manga itself is set in medieval Europe, and the art is just stunning; each panel is a masterpiece.<br>  <br>  The only caveat I have in recommending Berserk, is that it is extremely graphic in violence, gore, sex, and other very adult situations. I do not recommend this manga for anyone under the age of 18.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hope this was of some help.|`|dc62de57ba2aa6b4c40d4ab37b63647faa	SAILOR MOON!!!<br>  <br>  I agree with others that it is an amazing anime, and is usually the anime that people will remember was the gateway into anime for North America. Although it was actually created in 1992 in Japan and in 1995 in America, not in 1999. I remember watching Sailor Moon when I was little and then a couple of years ago rewatched all of the episodes.

s6ekS4IQaa	I agree with you....I thought they were an awesome couple!!! So cute together!!! I just don't know what got into him....I used to be such a big fan of his but now I have very little respect left for him.  I Think it's good he confessed but Rihanna should definately leave him... I fell really bad for her too and she's awesome!|`|Vf0g0q8uaa	Well at least people dont think he's gay anymore, he at least has some balls|`|YP0eCyJBaa	I still like him, he made a mistake people do and he should be forgiven.|`|JgKosPJpaa	yes i agree|`|HQjo5ojfaa	I still have respect for Chris Brown. I mean who knows what Rhianna was like and what she did?? No one knows these people personally so you shouldn't judge by their actions. I am not saying it is in anyway right what he did, or that it was excusable, but you just never know. Rhianna could be playing a grief story for all we know, all this stuff gets passed down 4th hand by the Media. And they ALWAYS twist things up. All I am saying is that we are most likely not getting the full story, and I have not lost respect for Chris Brown. Bad mouth me all you want if you disagree, but everyone has an opinion.|`|QVh0xdZCaa	being not a chris brown fan but liking his music i'm slip in the middle. its really hard to believe that someone like that would even do such a thing to a beautiful and talented girl such as rhianna. at the end of the day he made a mistake, everyone does, and i think that he should verbally apoligize to rhianna (and to the fans?) i think that its really tragic that something like that would even happen but its life...not always perfect.|`|D0JsiC0Paa	I always thought he was a real p*ssy from the start, a real sensitive, pretty boy, but beating up his girlfriend to feel better about himself, reaffirm his damaged masculinity or because he has too high and inflated a sense of self esteem is a new low for that little boy. If she goes back to him I will lose my faith in women and chivalry.|`|tGxP4th7aa	Yeah, I agree
s9ilTXJKaa	SPOILER ALERT <br>  <br>  i just got finished seing the movie long story short they kill jason by stbbing him hanging him and shreding his head but they threw him in the lake but after a fwew seconds he just comes back and grabs the girl who killed him and the movie just ends. i think the lake keeps bringing him back to life|`|AA12343006	Because he's a freak and he keeps making money for the big movie production companies.|`|AA11580836	There is never any explained reason as to why he dosent talk but the character if you seen the older movies and know about them, that his character had a mental problem and was picked on as a child and probably couldnt speak if at all. Far as the not dying, well thats pretty much with any horror slasher but for Jason, he is basically along with Freddy the top two horror killers of all time and people when seeing these movies want to see them and are cult heros or sorts. Plus of course it is just movies and thats the ultimate answer and Jason Voorhees will never die until they decide to stop making the movies and actuaully kill off permentely.|`|S1rX27RNaa	well, think about it--he got killed but he somehow came back from the dead...like freddie kruger, kind of, although freddie talks...<br>  he never talks cuz he doesn't have much to say, and--be honest--it would make it a wierd series. also, considering the realistic side, different people play him everytime so it would lessen the "movie magic" if u could hear his voice.|`|9LTWa08Laa	well according to the old jason movies from the 80's<br>  he never dies because a cult puts a curse on him so that hes immortal|`|S4pY0lBtaa	cause he's Jason ******* Vorhees :D|`|DiRRKyipaa	There Isn't really a reason why.

angTzfV2aa	Have you been singing a lot recently!? if you're not breathing properly and using your whole body to support your singing, your vocal chords may b wearing out easily. Singing without proper support could lead to you losing your voice so try singing in your head voice and singing downward scales without slipping! Having a well developed head voice can help by not putting too much pressure on your vocal chords. Always stand up straight when singing and make sure your chest isn't rising with breaths but your diaphragm is!<br>  hope this helped in some way!|`|wNLBfJRhaa	Do you warm up before you sing? You could be straining your voice a little too much. Maybe after more and more practice you can sing plenty of songs before your voice gets tired. Just don't force or overwork it, because then you can lose it!

5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	The Mad Viking's statements, all of them, are completely false. I thought about commenting on each of his statements, but they are so untrue that I don't find it worth my time.<br>  I'm guessing that he was counting on nobody showing up to answer who has even the slightest bit of jazz knowledge.<br>  <br>  Contrary to the Mad Viking's answer, Miles played a big part in the Cool movement. I big clue to this is the album title of his 1949 album, Birth of the Cool.<br>  Most of the classic cool jazz albums are from the mid 1950's, but Miles was always ahead of the pack.<br>  <br>  Stan Getz was a great cool player. I suggest the album called The Steamer.<br>  <br>  Art Pepper with the Rhythm Section is another classic west coast album, cool album.<br>  <br>  Chet Baker was a true legend of the west coast scene. He lived a crazy life, and his music was some of the most popular music of the beat culture. Get his Chet Baker and Crew album. That album has an al-star cool band.<br>  <br>  Lee Konitz with Warne Marshe is another classic. <br>  <br>  Shelly Manne was most often the drummer for a lot of the cool album sessions. His own album called Shelly Manne and his Men is great. He also has another album called The West Coast Sound. I Haven't actually heard the West Coast Sound, so I can't suggest it. <br>  <br>  Gerry Mulligan Meets Ben Webster is my personal favorite of the albums on my little list. They are essential cool players.<br>  <br>  Barney Kessel is the most popular cool guitarist. Try his album called To Swing Or Not to Swing.<br>  <br>  Zoot Sims album called Zoot Sims Quartet is af true cool album. Zoot played really clean. All of thes cool jazz artists were known for their precision, but I think Zoot might have been the cleanest (Konitz too).<br>  <br>  <br>  You should really know about the musicians who inspired the cool musicians. If you listen to the album called Laughin' to Keep From Cryin' by Lester Young you will hear what the cool jazz artists heard. Lester Young actually created the word "cool" as slang. This album also has two trumpeters that were a huge inspiration on the cool sound, Roy "Little Jazz" Eldridge and Harry "Sweets" Edison. Herb Ellis on guitar.<br>  You asked for cool albums, so I listed some, BUT if you are going to listen to cool, you should really hear this album. It' has the, by that time, experienced musicians who were inspiring the new young cool musicians theri whole life.<br>  <br>  PS-With respect to Elvis, the musicians he listed are not cool musicians. At east he was decent enough to let you know that he was answering with limited knowledge.And to to put things in perspective, I have limited jazz knowledge as compared to the people I learn from (very limited).<br>  <br>  Another PS- If you are serious about expanding your jazz listening, you should listen to WKCR(.org). There is no jazz station that come anywhere near the this station for playing ALL styles of jazz.|`|fcrFlFZQaa	Terence Blanchard is an internationally renowned jazz trumpeter, bandleader, composer, arranger, and Golden Globe-nominated film score composer...<br>  ...After performing on soundtracks for Spike Lee movies, including Do the Right Thing and Mo' Better Blues, Lee wanted Blanchard to compose the scores for his films beginning with "Jungle Fever" (1991). Blanchard has written the score for every Spike Lee film since including, Malcolm X, Clockers, Summer of Sam, 25th Hour, Inside Man.|`|wXv50mNEaa	I'm not that knowledgeable about jazz, or cool jazz specifically. but this question deserves some answers, so I'll kick it off with what I can offer. I don't have a huge collection, so I hope this isn't too elementary for you. I'm also sorry that I can't stick to cool jazz.<br>  <br>  Pharaoh Sanders<br>  Horace Silver<br>  Dexter Gordon<br>  George Russel<br>  Eric Dolphy|`|VYWaL2graa	No such thing as good cool jazz.<br>  <br>  Jazz died in the mid-late 40's. Bebop barely, by the skin of its teeth barely, qualifies as jazz.<br>  <br>  The stuff from the late 90's crappily labeled as rockabilly has more in common with jazz than does bebop, cool jazz, anything Miles Davis ever played, etc.

J36FKvkHaa	F'realz!? I knew their new album was coming out, but I didn't know they were touring. I probably should've figured that out, though - most bands do tour to promote their new stuff, huh?<br>  <br>  Ooo, I *hope* it sounds like Black Sails. That would be awesome, gang vocals and all, but I doubt it. It would piss off too many of their new fans - hardcore just isn't accessible to the mainstream.<br>  <br>  I'm kinda feelin' them moving in the direction of more classic-rock influenced stuff. Maybe something along the lines of Siouxsie and the Banshees, kinda, or The Cure. Dark and mellow. Some of the songs they were covering around the time of their last album seemed to be moving in that direction, anyway.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	That's cool.<br>  <br>  I hope the new album is at least more punk.

TJBEeXO2aa	Yes, you should sing from the diaphragm.<br>  Other than that, you should focus on getting your voice box down, the part where the adam apple lies for the males. To do that, always think of relaxing your lower jaw, hang it loose, but not forcefully. As you reach for the high notes, lower your jaw further.<br>  <br>  To prevent tone from spreading, do not open your mouth wide or horizontally on purpose. It causes tone to spread drastically.<br>  <br>  Also, keep your tongue at the tip of your lower teeth or gum, without tension, of course lest it will produce cramping. This is done so as to not let your tongue get in the way of your voice.<br>  <br>  Since you're a rock singer type I can't tell you the others because they are more to the classical side.|`|xUTeIaH1aa	Alcohol, cigarettes, and lack of sleep will destroy your voice. You'd be surprised how many rock singers in history have had some sort of gospel or other training, so get with a teacher, and practice. Learn about singing form your chest and from your head for the higher notes. Your breathing and ability to move air is so important. Good Luck to ya.
yqe0I5zpaa	Yes, the film is pretty self explanatory. Their is a scene where the entire plot of the original is basically described by some dude. The movie is really gory but it has more female nudity and sex scenes that blood and violence. You will understand the movie ok.

Myself I'm a big fan and seen all the others several times and have to say the remake was good, it took elements of the first four movies when Jason was still human and also added some other stuff but it stayed the course the whoel way and didnt ruin it unlike the Halloween remake did in my opinion that movie was totally wrong but this Friday the 13th is good for fans and the casual horror fan alike, you will enjoy it! If there is one thing I didnt care for was the amount of nudity and sex which yes is shown in all Friday the 13th movies but this one shows more then any other and really dont need to see all that, but otherwise the movie does the others justice.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	YES, if you are a "Blood & Gore" freak you'll LOVE IT!<br>  <br>  Nothing to know, Jason is Explained in the Beginning.....You'll UNDERSTAND IT, Believe ME....ENJOY!!|`|XCVFEAC8aa	Yes, you'll understand it!<br>  <br>  It's awesome!|`|BEoHK8V2aa	Yes, it's a remake, so you don't have to know much of anything.|`|7svUZBrFaa	Yes.

Tqof0Frnaa	I agree with Porcelain.dawl - altos rock man! We get the intricate harmonies that make the songs what they are. Yeah, sopranos seem so0o0o cool with their high ranges and fun melodies, but with out us altos, or any other parts without a melody for that matter, the melody is stripped of its importance. Altos don't get the melody because we have to help it give off the feeling that the composer desired.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way - as an alto, our ears are trained better than sopranos. I'm an alto in school, but in church I'm a soprano 1, and I notice it's easy to get lazy because of the fact that we have the melody and there isn't that much to it.<br>  <br>  Altos rule man, don't doubt.|`|1lh7oQsPaa	I consider myself an alto, but my range almost goes all the way up into the soprano range, and down into the tenor range.   Never getting the melody used to bug me too, but then I joined a chorus that included a "lead" role, which was reserved for women who had good intonation (pitch),  a nice tonality to their voice, & a mezzosoprano range (i.e. between alto & soprano).  Because my voice has a nice warm quality to it, even in my head voice,  I found that I got to sing "lead" (melody) almost all the time.  I suggest checking out local singing clubs & community choruses.|`|AA11437963	Ah, I'm sorry you're irritated but the explanation is pretty simple.  It's the same reason that the oboes and middle of the road instruments never get the melody in orchestras (violins and violas do).  Composers tend to put solos and melodies in higher ranges because they find the higher voices / instruments more pleasing to the ear and easier to hear.  It sucks, but I can guarantee you that's the reason why.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Its the way it usually is but the thing is altos have the harder stuff to sing. Singing alto is more harder than soprano. I was in choir in highschool and I know what you mean. Usually my teacher tries to pick a song that everyone gets a melody to sing....I think altos have good notes that make the song beautiful. Alto's give the song more of a dark vibe and it makes it have a haunting sound that many people want to listen too. It usually depends on the song. Think about it. You have more of a harder piece to sing than sopranos but it makes the song worth it.

I really don't want to believe that he did it, but why would he apologize for something that he didn't do.  It just might make me look at him differently now.  He so handsome and so innocent looking, who would have known.  I guess still waters run deep.  On the other hand, the media needs to back up of this situation and let them handle it.  They always gotta be in peoples business to the extreme, like damn, let them live and deal with it.|`|LQgJ5hzBaa	me personally i think that photo might have been photo shopped. and i think Chris didn't do it, i think another female did this senseless act of violence|`|fzqtUZ0Oaa	he stole crack out of my locker! i got in huge trouble because this is a new building and the lockers are new. and i mean officially opened 3 weeks ago! they didnt care that i had drugs|`|PzVLLTwNaa	Wow, looks pretty bad.

He is not the type of person to do that. That picture was defiantly over exaggerated. Rihanna need to leave and go back to Barbados because she is really pissing me of. She makes it looks like Chris was the bad person and everyone is turning on him even before they hear to whole story its ridiculous.|`|WyUtj9wsaa	I mean i think part of it is the real deal but some of it may have been photo-shopped to make Chris seem worse than he really is.

Leo will play with fire and doesn’t mind getting burned. Pisces will see confidence and a night out on the town with Leo. Pisces will be drawn to Leo’s confidence.<br>  <br>  Leo will be attracted to Pisces strong sexuality. Problems will arise when Pisces needs space. Leo is basically faithful and will not tolerate disloyalty. Pisces seeks a deeper connection and could find Leo to bossy for his or her taste. Pisces will also find Leo much more aggressive than they had bargained for. It may be best to call it a night before either gets involved here. Leo will roar when not treated like royalty and Pisces will shut down immediately and swim away when they sense manipulation or underhanded behavior.<br>  <br>  Leo will eventually conclude that Pisces wasn’t the right person after all.<br>  <br>  <br>  pisces & libras<br>  You two will drink, dance and make music together. You both are talented, social and appreciate the good life. There will be fun, variety and attraction when these two are together. Libra will see a future and security with Pisces.<br>  <br>  Pisces will see class and style and will want to show off Libra in public. This could be a lasting and memorable romance. There will be a strong family tie involved in the relationship at some point. If both are committed to being committed to one another, then aspects are very good for long-term love. Sex will very passionate and Pisces will want to make a love affair legal.<br>  <br>  Avoid secrets and go for it. Children could be a surprise here!|`|d6r5hRjYaa	hmm im a pisces girl and my babies dad is a leo.. i liked him alot and he is very appealing. he isnt even that cute but he has alot of sex appeal. i think cause its out complete opposite that we like them and opposites attract.  but ive learned it DOES NOT work out in the end.  <br>  <br>  as for libras never really had a crush on them or anything soo idk?|`|pLUItVZ1aa	libras deffinatley|`|plBXp91Daa	A Pisces friend of mine find Leo's attractive he told me that himself.|`|cyRDKRIDaa	Ohmygoshh.<br>  <br>  I fall head-over-heels for Libras' everytime.<br>  I can't get enough of them...but they don't seem to like pisces that much...|`|2CYfjPA6aa	Not necessarily. Pisces usually are attracted to other water signs, Cancer and Scorpio. I suppose a Pisces may find a Libra attractive in that they both are very artistic and love beauty, but Leo and Pisces have nothing really in common, so I don't think Pisces is particularly attracted to Leos.|`|FIdA3FiCaa	you are drawn to these two because of the way you three are placed on the horoscope chart. you may have trouble understanding one another, but you'll most def be drawn to their intriguing charisma in a general and sexual way.|`|wZa3qiSbaa	My first boyfriend was a Leo, I like him cause he was funny always made me laugh and he could dress, other than that there was nothing really attractive about him, the sex was crap!|`|1PdUecpYaa	i'm a pisces and i've dated both...<br>  i think i can be attracted to any signs... people are interesting...
ax9xk0Ndaa	Yeah one of my closest friends is a Leo and i have other leo friends and some in my family and we get along fiine..<br>  <br>  We always have jokes..enjoy each other's company..and there fun to be around..<br>  <br>  Really like them..<br>  <br>  I can see why we're not supposed to be compatibile though<br>  <br>  (My boyfriend is a Leo......(1day off a Cancer) Cancer/Leo ..but just a Leo to those that don't believe in cusps..) I can definitely see why relationshipwise it's not supposed to work....don't ask why i'm still with him lol..<br>  ..but yeah Capricorn's can get annoyed with Leo's not understanding them.. And Leo's can get annoyed with not getting all the attention they feel they deserve..<br>  Capricorns might get annoyed at how much a Leo can bigup theirselves as if they're just the best.. Leo can get annoyed with Capricorns looking deep into things they don't feel has any importance..|`|4P9no5CTaa	Capricorn is fascinated with Leo and there is potential for a lasting love here. Hard work and the desire for success will play an important role in bonding you to one another. Hidden agendas and manipulation do not exist in the land of Capricorn, Leo.<br>  <br>  Keep jealousy and games out of the picture or lose Capricorn forever. Capricorn gets better with age and is very much attracted to a prestigious lifestyle. Leo needs to understand how important success really is for Capricorn and Capricorn needs to analyze Leo a little less frequently.<br>  <br>  All in all, the scenario looks sexually promising. It only gets better with Capricorn, Leo! Leo could eventually tire of Capricorn’s uptight attitude towards sex and money. Leo could walk away and Capricorn may be left wondering what just happened.|`|FIdA3FiCaa	caps and leos are pretty neutral.  they may have trouble understanding each other, but are intrigued by each other and have the urge to help one another. (for caps, this goes for gemini's as well).|`|X5dsqBPqaa	Horoscopes are baseless, they mean nothing.|`|plBXp91Daa	I know someone here from Y&A and we have a good chemistry.I also get along fine with my aunt & uncle who are both Capricorns and i'm a Leo.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	As friends, co-workers, buddies...very good possiblity.<br>  <br>  As lovers or long term...not so good unless something in their synastry is good. The Sun signs don't click. And there is NO way that Capricorn is fascinated with Leo....unless its amazement of how they spend money on the dumbest of crap without thinking about how their going to pay for it. That was always "fascinating" to me.

afYKOBzkaa	I would probably prefer Rihanna's "Take a Bow".|`|nNAAClOqaa	Personally, I would choose something a little more......happy and upbeat. Take a Bow isn't bad but its depressing. No One is also very good but still a little too slow. A good one might be Disturbia or maybe even stretching it a little bit a Celine Dion song called Taking Chances. I love that song but it is quite high. Good luck!|`|ImvitFicaa	none i hate them both pick something else you know how many people have song that song or at least try and people like to see something different but i mean if you like it well than...|`|NCSKeRXTaa	Take a bow

The teacher asked, 'Harry, what's your problem?' <br>  <br>  Harry answered, 'I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!' <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. <br>  <br>  While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed. <br>  <br>  Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. <br>  <br>  Principal: 'What is 3 x 3?' <br>  <br>  Harry: '9.' <br>  <br>  Principal: 'What is 6 x 6?' <br>  <br>  Harry: '36.' <br>  <br>  And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. <br>  <br>  The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, 'I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade.' <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks says to the principal, 'Let me ask him some questions.' <br>  <br>  The principal and Harry both agreed. <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?' <br>  <br>  Harry, after a moment: 'Legs.' <br>  <br>  Ms Brooks: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?' <br>  <br>  The principal wondered why would she ask such a question! <br>  <br>  Harry replied: 'Pockets.' <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What does a dog do that a man steps into?' <br>  <br>  Harry: 'Pants.' <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks: What starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?' <br>  Harry: 'Coconut.' <br>  <br>  The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open. <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?' <br>  The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, 'Bubble gum.' <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?' <br>  Harry: 'Shake hands.' <br>  <br>  The principal was trembling. <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks: 'What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?' <br>  Harry: 'Firetruck.' <br>  The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, 'Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven question s wrong......'<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A little girl runs out to the backyard where her father is working, and asks him, "Daddy, what's sex?"<br>  <br>  Her father sits her down, and tells her all about the birds and the bees. He tells her about conception, sexual intercourse, sperms and eggs. He goes on to tell her about puberty, menstruation, erections, wet-dreams...and he thinks, what the hell, and goes on to tell her the works. He covers a wide and varied assortment of sub topics and by the time he's finished, his daughter is somewhat awestruck with this sudden influx of bizarre new knowledge. Her father finally asks: "So what did you want to know about sex for?"<br>  <br>  "Oh, mommy said to tell you lunch would be ready in a couple<br>  of secs..."<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day.

She's a bit crazy :p, but to me it just comes off as more passion than she knows what to do with. She wanted her shot SO badly, plus she's a hell of a singer, so I was really upset that she didn't make it through instead of Michael. Simon almost seemed upset when she was cut,though, so maybe he'll pick her as a Wildcard, I hope. But I really think she at least deserves another chance.

rHrr7zmVaa	The Wildcard system was used in Season 3 too, and I think the purpose for this is to eliminate the bad contestants faster and to lessen the impact of votefortheworst by bringing good contestants to top 12 some of which are the judges decision. And they save a lot of licensing fees since each contestant need to sing just one song before making it to top 12.|`|AA12390047	They made some changes that are good for the show.|`|kbxq8o9saa	LOLZ!<br>  <br>    io dunno, too!<br>  <br>    it's like they can get 9 pipz only...<br>     and then i think there will be wildcards stuffs! yeah, it's crazy!<br>  <br>    i think that's their twists, but it's really confusing! hehe!<br>  <br>      XD|`|AA12363453	To tell you the truth I only enjoy it at the beginning when people sing as if they are on "crack" and everyone knows that "crack is whack". But to answer your question, they have change it up and hey it is what it is...|`|cucY09Xvaa	It's Simon Cowell.<br>  Whatever he does in the UK with 'X factor' he will take over to the states and do it there. It's how it's always been.|`|Ib2NPdPmaa	well...the wild card round was last used in Season 3.<br>  Maybe they want to make it more interesting? :]|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	they didn't want to do the boy/girl thing again because they didn't think it would be fair if most of the girls were great but most of the guys sucked, or vice versa, because then really talented people of one gender were being passed for less talented people of the other gender. So I kind of see where they're coming from. But,at the same time, I think it's more unfair like this because not only does each contestant only have one shot, but if the groups are divided unevenly and some have a lot of good people and some have all suckish people, you still have really talented people with stiff competition being passed for less talented people with less competition. So I'd actually rather go back to the boy/girl thing because at least they got the best of each gender. But I've hated this system ever since they booted Lisa Leuschner in Season 3. She was an amazing singer and should've been up there with Fantasia and Jennifer Hudson, but she was in a group of the best contestants so she was passed for less talented people who happened to be the least suckish in their suckish group. And we've already had 2 casualties of the system this season with Tatiana Del Toro and Anoop Desai. At least they have the Wildcard round, but I hope the judges/America choose them carefully and that voters vote fairly to make sure that the people who deserve to be in the Top 12 make it there.|`|uUoKksjVaa	My guess is they didn't want to do the same routine every year,so they changed it up.I agree with you.I don`t like that you have to pick the top 3 from a group of 12.|`|nBjQQ3yraa	I don't like it either.

But how can she ever trust her? It's not so much the one kiss, that could be chalked up to drunkenness, tension, nerves, whatever, but not admitting to Bianca that she had feelings for Zach for months- that's the real betrayal. Reese is too messed-up and mixed-up and needs to get her...act together before she hurts Bianca or anyone else again.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I really hope not since I can't stand Reese.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Bianca is very hurt, and betrayed.

It is also on Limewire, which is free to download, and you can find a video or the song on youtube and use a youtube downloader to get it (also free to download).

9o3eWYcEaa	I don’t find it that hard (not as a player: it’s out of my reach,but in general). The lyrical aspects of the Andantino semplice, introduced by flute at the beginning and returning in the finale of the tempo, before plunging into the Allegro con fuoco of 3rd movement, seem to prevail on the Prestissimo (based on a french song), which has the character of a development on the theme, in full slavonic style. That appears clearly in the 2-piano transcription by Tchaik himself (1874, before the Von Bulow premiere in Boston).<br>  The historical performance of conductor Arturo Toscanini and son-in-law soloist Vladimir Horowitz in the 1940s was unreachable.|`|tuATxHsVaa	I'm a pianist and I can answer your question. The Prestissimo section of the second movement is widely considered to be one of the most difficult parts of the entire concerto. For this and many other reasons, the concerto has earned the title "Hymn of the Virtuosi" for its extreme difficulty. <br>  <br>  Don't you have a private teacher that can tell you whether it's at your level or not?<br>  <br>  There's more than one Liebestraum, by the way. Did you play No. 3? <br>  <br>  They aren't songs, they are pieces, works, etc.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure at all that you are ready for the Tchaikovsky concerto.<br>  <br>  Here's a great recording of Cliburn playing this concerto movement, btw:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvyx569SWyI&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvyx569SW...</a><br>  <br>  His playing is so fantastic!|`|kbFty6eVaa	Hard as hell

Both signs will want to hit the party circuit and mingle together. Gemini is very attracted to outgoing and independent Aquarius. Aquarius sees sex and a relationship with this easy carefree sign known as Gemini. Together, they can build a sexual relationship that could make it to the altar. On the flipside, however, Aquarius could get cold feet and feel trapped by Gemini. Gemini could become impatient with Aquarius and finally walk away bitter. They key to making this relationship work is to know when to walk away. Do not play games with each other and that goes double for Aquarius.|`|FIdA3FiCaa	yes, gemini and aquarius are both air signs. everyone with the same trine (air, fire, water, earth) have very positive and harmonious relationships.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	perfect match|`|UW8eqIo0aa	It is supposed to be WONDERFUL!|`|oSyCJs4iaa	yes|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Gemini and Aquarius are compatible for each other.

TJBEeXO2aa	okay, for starters, falsetto is like the head voice of the males.<br>  <br>  If possible, male singers should never be afraid of developing their falsettos, as it is very benificial.<br>  <br>  However, you should never 'push' for a falsetto. You are straining for the note. That is not good, it damages your vocal chords and causes tension.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you work on the high notes that you CAN reach - the proper way. In which sense, means that your jaw should lower further as you go higher.

ichCJlWyaa	Im a secret JK fan and i totally agree with you - these people need to put some decent clothes on !!! But its a sign of the times that people would rather humiliate themselves on national tv than to pay for things like a DNA test.<br>  <br>  The shows that are the best are the lie detector ones - especially when they get caught out - CLASSIC entertainment.<br>  <br>  But in answer to your question you either have to be mad, bad or sad to appear on the JK show....which means there will always be plenty of willing morons ready to humiliate themselves !!!|`|cucY09Xvaa	I think he's a fake. And a con. I don't think they are real 'public' people, just actors who the show have hired.<br>  Honestly, think about it. Why would someone agree to go on that show?

EfcWVrdFaa	Honey, it's gonna cost you money for someone to write you a song, whether it's rap, rock, or R&B. I've been writing lyrics for years.. they call people that write and sell lyrics "ghost writers." A lot of the songs you hear on the radio were written by a ghost writer, not the artist - and these lyrics sell for big bucks. Just like the beat for the song ain't free either.. and they ain't cheap, by all means. I'd suggest having a friend help you or start reading the dictionary cause I ain't tryna be mean, but nobody is gonna throw you lyrics for free. Unless you are some nasty MC that we ain't never heard of and you get discovered by someone and they decide to help you out. If you don't have the gift of writing lyrics.. which comes naturally for most lyricists, I might consider putting my energy into something else. If you can freestyle, go from there. Write those down and try to make it into a song. Good luck.

There were like 40 people there and one of them was my crush and his best guyfriends. I know scary right? So anyways I walked in and I had a halter top on. All of a sudden my best guy friend walked up and while he was giving me a hug, he UNTIED MY TOP! While he stepped away my top fell down and I screemed at the top of my lungs. Then, we all started laughing (myself included) because it was just so hilarious. And then as I was walking down my stairs, I fell. I literally fell down the stairs. It was mortifying!

BHpELpEqaa	1. Philip was kissing Melanie and Stephanie walked in and Steph was telling Melanie something like "You know this is how a Kiriakis does buisness, right?" or "He is just doing this for buisness, right?" (something like that! haha) <br>  2. i'm not really sure, but here is my idea. Philip is a business guy just like his old man, Victor so i think Philip would do ANYTHING to make sure Melanie doesn't move the project anywhere, most of all to the DiMerra's. i don't think they said anything but so many people have said that Philip likes Melanie and sometimes i think he does and other times i don't think that he does. we'll just se how it plays out. <br>  3. I think he might actually. would you really give someone $10,000 who treated you like s**t before unless you had feelings for them? or go and almost beat up someone for threatening you? (talking about Baker) hmm i think he might but i'm not sure, we'll find out though!<br>  <br>  **if you miss Days of Our Lives on NBC then it does repeats at 11:00p.m the same day on soap net. usually channel 73 for most time warner people and then the next day at 10:00a.m (same channel)**<br>  <br>  also you can read this to see everything that happened!<br>  <a href="http://www.soapoperafan.com/days/friday.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soapoperafan.com/days/friday....</a><br>  <br>  also if you want some spoilers!<br>  <a href="http://www.soaps.com/daysofourlives/spoilers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soaps.com/daysofourlives/spoi...</a><br>  here/\/\    and............<br>  <a href="http://www.dayscafe.com/hot-spoilers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dayscafe.com/hot-spoilers.htm...</a><br>  here/\/\<br>  <br>  i read them and omg! can't waittttt!|`|qWzN3i3Uaa	1) Stephanie caught Phillip kissing Melanie but Melanie does not think that the kiss was sinceer, but Stephanie didn't know any thing else but what she saw. So later on Stephanie slapped Melanie across the face<br>  2) Friday's show would lead you to think that Phillip meant what he said about Melanie, but i read the episode guide for Monday's episode and Stephanie went to go see Phillip and said she knows the kiss was just bussiness but she no longer wants to be with some one who will go that far for buissness. As she is leaving he says he loves her but she stills leaves<br>  3) I think Brady is just helping Nicole because he saw how devestated she was with the loss of her baby.Brady doesn't know about the baby switch so if he finds out about that i don't think he will be as quick to help her as he is now|`|iPoWzRSVaa	Philip inadvertently comes across Brady and Nicole and realizes they are keeping something from EJ. He confronts Nicole, accusing her of having an affair with Brady. She denies, but Philip can tell she and Brady share a secret. He uses this information to give Nicole an ultimatum. Nicole initially resists and nearly calls Philip's bluff, but in the end she agrees to try to get EJ to back off pursuing the Alternative Fuels Project. <br>  <br>  EJ breaks up a fight between Stephanie and Melanie, but the darker side of him comes out as he puts the screws to Melanie, forcing her to sign a contract which gives the DiMeras the rights to develop the fuels project. Brady shows up and confronts EJ, who blows him off and leaves. Brady talks to Melanie and realizes Philip may have dug his own grave regarding the fuels project. At the same time, Stephanie breaks up with Philip, stating that she can't deal with his business persona. Back at the DiMera mansion, EJ returns and Nicole tries to plead with him not to mess with the Kiriakis family.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Here is a link to today's summary....and it will answer all your questions, except #3...about Brady & Nicole....yes, I think that Brady is in love with Nicole....<br>  <br>  I think when he was with her and she lost her baby, it touched him and he saw something vulnerable in her that made him able to love her again, even after all she had done in the past...and I think they will wind up together after EJ eventually finds out what she has done, stealing Sammi's baby....God knows how long it will take...<br>  <br>  Here's your link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.soapoperafan.com/days/friday.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soapoperafan.com/days/friday....</a>|`|TzeYsXKGaa	1) Stephanie has been upset with Philip for his attitude that he will do ANYTHING for the business and he gives Melanie extra attention due to this as well as the fact that he shows his other side...the jerk side<br>  2) It seems that Philip is mainly doing it for the fuels projects but everyone is accusing him of also liking Melanie and I think it's leading that way<br>  3) Its hard to say.Brady just seems to love everyone right now, but that would certainly be an interesting turn of events.

AA12376180	The only way to tell the age of a piano is the serial number. If this is an upright piano lift the top lid and look down at the cast iron plate. there should be a 5 digit number either stamped on the plate or actually stamped in the wood (pinblock) behind the plate. If this is a grand piano the number should be stamped somwhere arond the tuning pins.The number should look something like this 42657.<br>  <br>  Once you have the serial number e-mail me and I will look it up in the Pierce Piano Atlas and it will give us the year the piano was built.<br>  <br>  Bush and Lane was established in Chicago in 1901. A few years later relocated to Michigan, and went belly up in 1931.|`|ctWQFKwNaa	I don't really know, but you could check the inside of it (if it's anything like one of my pianos).|`|rNqF4gIVaa	The best way to find out is "The Piano Book" by Larry Fine.

2bVxBCgzaa	It's most likely not a reference to any song in particular, but rather the concept of having an old song that is meaningful in your life, as most people do. It's similar to a plot device in movies called a "MacGuffin", meaning something that is used simply to move the story forward- think of the breifcase in Pulp Fiction; we never find out what's in it, because it doesn't matter. So it doesn't matter what the song is, only that we can relate to having a special song.

He was a teenager when he met The Doors. He went on to become their manager and got hooked on heroin and its a wonderful story.<br>  <br>  If you want just a biography, you have to get with, "No One Here Gets Out Alive," a biography of Jim Morrison.|`|xwD8PUFlaa	My favourite is Come as you are: the story of Nirvana by Michael Azerrad.<br>  <br>  Cause it was written b4 Kurt died, it just tells wat happened & doesn't try 2 relate everything 2 his death.|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Heroin Diaries- Nikki Six of Motley Crue<br>  <br>  Tribute to Dimebag Darrell- Alot of good stories about him.|`|oSsxqITSaa	Bob Dylan's history is VERY interesting to me.

I do accept paypal, checks, and cash. I would subsequently use it to go towards a really nice HP Tablet PC that I've had my eye on for a while now. Check out the baby linked in my sources here. I think it's certainly a worthy purchase although it doesn't cover what a tablet PC is capable of. Look into Tablet PCs. The video demo of the new Gateway Tablet PC is visable at www.tigerdirect.com. If it were me, I'd use that 250.00 to go towards one of them for me. So, if for some bizzare reason you don't give me the money, the Tablet PC would be my suggestion. Either that or a whole lot of Runts candies and Gardettos. Those are pretty good.|`|WhVSb2fbaa	put it in savings, it's hard times.

Leo is all about attention gaining... full of energy and with extreme anger,excitement,emotions etc.. and virgo its very feminine... having lotta patience, very dedicated to work and responsibilites.. vwell grounded possesive... so a feminie sign like virgo can cool the roaring masculine sign leo... earth signs always keeps people grounded.. so they both can do well... though its fire and earth... i've a brother to be a leo and her wife to be a virgo... shez perfectionaist and that jus impress my leo brother... leo's like women who are succesful and show stoppers... they even admire beauty... so if the virgo shows her feminism and be beautiful and sucessful leo guys fly for them... and leo guys are succesful and very work oriented and Fun... so this female needs some excitement in life which is fulfilled by the leo... by the way good luck:)
NSKimt1Qaa	Jack Klugman's a fine actor, but I gotta go with House's Hugh Laurie.  I'm not really into these medical, mystery, detective shows too much.  I've watched enough of House to know that well-rounded or not, his character is a great one.  Dark, smart, humorous, unafraid to go against the grain - he's got moxy!  Maybe to be really fair, I need to watch some Quincy reruns, though.  You watch those older shows a lot, don't you?|`|EY2ixfZzaa	yes house was interesting on the first season but now i just don't think so but yes I would have to go with Quincy!!!!|`|4lkKXJCKaa	HOUSE!!|`|YRaael7gaa	House all the way btw wats Quincy???|`|rzGAyr4Aaa	House!!!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Quincy!

It was a normal night, but little did he know, he would never make it through the night...<br>  While he was on Y!A the aliens just landed on Earth and were outside of his house...spying on him through his window. Rockfan was unaware of these mysterious creatures.<br>  <br>  "O.M.G.! What..is...that?...." the blue alien asked the red alien.<br>  "That earthling is named 'Rockfan'" the red alien replyed.<br>  "EW! It..is..utterly repulsive!!!" the blue alien said.<br>  "I know.. we must... destroy him.." the red alien said. <br>  "But how?" the blue alien asked.<br>  "Don't worry, in the middle of the night, when this Rockfan creature is asleep, we will terminate him." the red alien replied simply. <br>  "Easy enough" the blue alien agreed.<br>  <br>  While time passed, the red and blue alien continually stared at the disgusting creature known as Rockfan, they didn't move an inch the whole time, they just kept staring..and staring..and staring..as their prey typed away on his computer's keyboard... <br>  That night, when Rockfan was about to go to sleep, he asked one final question. Since the aliens could read minds, they decided they would brake into his how now, so when dear Rockfan turned around, he would be eaten as dinner for the two very hungry foreigners. Quietly, the red and blue alien sneaked into Rockfan's house and were standing behind him while he was on his computer. They were so silent, that Rockfan hadn't even noticed he was being stalked..every waking moment, until his death. The aliens saw that he was reading an answer to his question that was titled "If aliens came to earth, what do you think their first reaction would be?" and then the description was "What would they say? I'm looking for some really creative answers!" the aliens smiled to themselves at the stupidity of this mere creature known as Rockfan. Then, Rockfan scrolled down to one of the answers, it was an answer from ツMaddyツ. While the aliens were behind Rockfan's back reading the answer at a lightning speed with their advanced brains, they saw that ツMaddyツ's answer was right, and they saw that she knew too much..she knew the future..*DUN*, *DUN*, *DUN*! The aliens were puzzled, they would have to deal with her later.. <br>  Then, while Rockfan came to the part where ツMaddyツ said (TURN AROUND ROCKFAN...) Rockfan turned around..and...<br>  <br>  CABAAAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  RIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  MUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  CHEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  SWALLOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  The aliens destroyed Rockfan and ate him in less then 1/100 of a second.....................................<br>  <br>  <br>  The two aliens stared at the now destroyed, Rockfan's computer screen. <br>  <br>  "We must destroy this ツMaddyツ, she knows too much..." The blue alien said.<br>  <br>  "Yes, we must." The red alien agreed.<br>  <br>  And with that, the blue and red alien hopped into their U.F.O. and flew through the sky's....heading off to kill ツMaddyツ................<br>  <br>  <br>  (NOW ROCKFAN, TURN AROUND.............................)|`|VoKzvoxKaa	Take me to your leader!!!<br>  <br>  lol|`|bnGnE58zaa	fresh meat|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	If they were able to come to Earth, they would have to be a much more advanced civilization than us.

As far as I'm concerned, being against the war is standing up for the ideals this country was founded on: "Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations -- entangling alliances with none," as Jefferson said. Or, as John Quincy Adams put it, "We go not abroad in search of monsters to destroy."<br>  <br>  Anyway, Bob Dylan's "Masters of War" is timeless in its indictment of the War Machine. If you want metal, I'd go with Slayer's "War Ensemble" or System of a Down's "Boom!"

GoodLuck!|`|3u4HU7rdaa	0_0....................................<br>  0_0...............................<br>  0_0.........................<br>  dude.......................<br>  i feel so sorry for you.|`|d5COR2S2aa	dun worry, you get used to it<br>  the best thing to do is be yourself...<br>  make sure to approach ppl (but don't do it in a creepy, needy way), and don't just expect ppl to come up to you cuz then you'll just alienate urself<br>  be nice to ppl, no matter waht they look like<br>  be a bright student - don't sit in the back just to 'blend in'<br>  be funny in class - helps to win friends :)<br>  it's a new start, so embrace it. new starts r greats cuz no one knew what you were like before, so you can be flirty if you were shy, you can be outgoing if you were withdrawn, you can be funny if you were quiet. you can be ANYTHING =]<br>  <br>  so, with that in mind.... good luck!!|`|KVzBqWhvaa	I live in GA ^^.<br>  When I first moved here everyone was really nice (I think in the south they are more friendlier). When I first walked into my homeroom everyone was saying hi to me and this one girl told me I could sit with her at lunch because if I didn't make any new friends she didn't want me sitting alone because it happened to her haha. But ya, at first you're nervous but hopefully you'll meet some nice people ;]|`|CWZR9ipFaa	i moved from boston to philly for my freshman year<br>  <br>  i made alot of 'buddies' but not many 'friends'<br>  <br>  then i made one 'best friend' and that led to alot more friends and now alot of people know me<br>  <br>  but i'm movin' to scranton next year<br>  <br>  myadvice-be calm, be friendly, dont make scenes|`|BTkHkkJTaa	i was new in 5th grade.  its cool, usually everyone wants to meet you and find out where your from.  You should have fun with them and fake a british accent and tell them your from london-No- scratch that haha but just be yourself, it will be fine.  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|xBd96wvRaa	It's fun you have the opportunity to reinvent yourself.|`|WnoHELH5aa	you will prblly feel awkward and out of place but eventually you will get adjusted to the new enviroment.

The first day, in high school, the kids were so unfriendly. They never said hello, never smiled, never asked me to join them, never started up a conversation, never were nice. When I did say something, they simply gave a short, simple answer and I got the hint that they didn't want to talk to me. <br>  <br>  I was new at lunch, so I had no where to sit. I go over to a table with a few open seats with average looking girls sitting there.<br>  <br>  "Hi, do you mind if I sit here?"<br>  The leader says vert sarcastically and rude, "Ummmm no,.....someones already sitting there.....SORRY!"<br>  <br>  Next table did the same thing.<br>  Finally an all boys table let me sit there. But they never acknowledged my presence. Even when I stared at them, they didn't seem to notice and ignored me completely. And they knew I was a new student. <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe it's just my school, or the schools I happened to go to, but people were always very unfriendly towards me. Especailly in high school. The girls already have so many friends, why would they want to add me as a friend? I mean, if they were desperate enough for another friend, then maybe they would have struck up a conversation with me, But no, the boys AND girls bully me. Maybe it's because I'm asian. I was always nice, and still am. But high school kids can be very cruel.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best luck. Try to have fun and don't take any unfriendly people personally. They just have their own problems.|`|NnlL3usKaa	Hmm...well i live in ny. and i have to say, it isn't as bad as you think. just be calm, and understand that people will want to know you, they'll be interested because after all, you are new! which would they chose, stare at the board, as usual, or meet someone they've never met before? <br>  to some people, i assume that to even be frightening. everything will fall into place given time. just sit back, relax, and learn from this experience. <br>  i've moved several times throughout both middle school and highschool. so i know that it's scary, and a little overwhelming, though it's school, and isn't it always scary anyway? lol<br>  best of luck.|`|w1IF79vJaa	just be really nice and lots of people will like you. i think its better if you go while the classes are already in progress..because otherwise no one will know you are new. they will just think that they never met you. if you go while classes have already started, people will ask about you.<br>  <br>  i think its good to be the new person. you get a fresh new start.|`|eta0c25yaa	I was the new girl in the 10th grade and it sucked! No one talked to me till 3 months later since im such a quite person. Especially the first day, when you eat lunch..you dont know who to sit next to... So i just sat outside on the bench and then this girl sat next to me and we started talking. She became my first friend from school. :)|`|kNKj4uDCaa	it's a chance to start over. ever thought of joining the field hockey team or playing volleyball or working on the yearbook squad? now's ur chance to try something new and meet a whole new set of friends. now a days, ppl love something new a different, so u can explore a whole new u! have fun, be friendly and work hard!|`|WYLL9f3Maa	It's what ever. if you annoy people then, I don't know what to say to you but if you real cool then it's goona be cool.

AA12351337	You might have a point.  But, your also not going to be the only one with this idea.  Which it is a good idea, he would want to hear from his fans.  But he's the "King of the South", so thousands will be writing to him.  You could always do it, and then if he reads your letter, he might respond.  He won't have much anything better to do.<br>  It would be easy to get to him.  Address the letter to 'Clifford "T.I." Harris' and then the address to the jail he's in, whatever it is.<br>  <br>  EDIT: He won't have a Public Relations dept. in Prison.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	No. They have people that do that for them. More than likely you'll get a reply back, but it'll only be from the PR department.<br>  <br>  When I was a kid, I was in love with Garth Brooks, wrote him a fan letter, got a generic letter back "oh thank you for liking me blahblahblah" and some postcards.<br>  <br>  [edit] his letters will still be going to his PR, not to the prison.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	ummm yea, you got too much free time.   For one, it's T.I.  You know intelligence is just flowing from his presence . . . flowing.  I mean sure, his lyrics are inspiring and he changes lives with his music     :|       but that is borderline creepy.  Think "Stan" by eminem.
4c21500c8c155e06427c936dd0036c86aa	Without a doubt, Kate.  She has no right going after Carly and rubbing it in that Sonny chose her and that she also slept with Jax while he and Carly were separated.  I don't like the way she is so rude to her cousin Olivia when Olivia has taken care of her when she was in the hospital and been good to her.  I can understand her going after Claudia with what she has on her, but Kate is handling it the wrong way.  Kate did say she was going to make Sonny pay for choosing to stay with Claudia, but what she needs to do think about how he's going to react when he finds out she kept him in the dark about Dante.<br>  <br>  As for Nicholas, he is taking following Rebecca around a little too far, especially since she has asked him to leave her along.  But I can see his need to find out about his dead ex-wife's look alike and if she does have a connection to Emily.|`|Jnp9qQWJaa	Nik. Especially because Rebecca has asked him to leave her alone countless times. <br>  <br>  I think Kate is justified in what she's doing, because she had the proof to show that Claudia shot the man she love's son, but then her stupid pain in the *** cousin Olivia threw that proof into fire.<br>  <br>  I think Olivia's a stalker personally. What is she still doing hanging around town anyway? Shouldn't she be getting home to her grown son who a few weeks ago called her every 4 seconds to check on her? Talk about stalker, my honorable mention goes to Dante.|`|33462b45e7f5e8fa0d2c9a98b11323c9aa	Good question....  I didn't really put the stalking issue together --- but GH does have the "stalking stories" going on now, don't they? <br>  <br>  biggest stalker?   IMHO -- Kate. She ragged out Sonny and turned him away when he came to her to work things out....now she is back literally leaving her business to two dingbats to run while she is sneaking around his premises attempting to be coy. Not working tho. <br>  <br>  Poor Nick... he was adjusting, getting used to it... now, this Rebecca has him running around like a male dog sniffing out a female in heat. He's a close second to Kate. <br>  <br>  I agree... Winnie's hair needs a makeover.  Maybe Maxie can help her with that.   LOL.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	Nic for sure. Kate's a pain, but at times, she does have her dignity. Nic witness Emily die (right in front of his eyes). When he tried to help, he was prevented from that. He was helpless. That did something to him. He can't get over it. Still, I would vote him the bigger stalker.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Kate.  I can understand Nicolas' need to explore this, but Kate?  Give it up, lady.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I vote for Nikolas. Yes, we know she looks exactly like Emily and it's understandable that he'd want to figure out the connection, but he knows she's not Emily, so leave the poor woman alone! It's not her fault that she looks like Em, and she doesn't owe him anything. Maybe if he'd back off for a while and then try to be friendly to her, Rebecca, and lay off the whole resemblance thing she might talk to him.<br>  <br>  Kate's just pathetic. She wants to tell Sonny, but she doesn't want to be to blame for Claudia's death. Either speak up or drop it! I wish she'd stop sneaking around, playing mind games with Claudia, and ordering Olivia (the one person who truly cares about her) around without telling her the full story.<br>  <br>  Poor Winnie just has a huge crush. I'm sure she'll get a make-over soon. She's quite cute in real life.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	Yes I agree especially about Nic.. dang he is coming off as way creepy.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	At this point, I would have to say Kate is the biggest stalker,,,walking into Sonny's house and snooping around repeatedly----get over it girl !<br>  <br>  Nik is completely stunned by the uncanny resemblance, but at least he isn't going through Rebecca's room,  yet  lol<br>  <br>  An Honorable Mention  LOL  I like that|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Tough one! I think Winnie, bc she seems more pathetic but Nikolas is running a close second. Kate has good reason, she knows what Claudia did!|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I think Kate is the worst.|`|AA12315431	Nik is definitely. I don't blame him for being curious and shocked but he shouldn't be following her around constantly. I mean give the girl some breathing room!<br>  <br>  As for Kate. I just don't know what to say about her. If she wants Sonny to know what Claudia did, then why doesn't she just tell him and get it over with? On the other hand, she made it clear that she was going to make Sonny pay for what he has done to her so I don't know where her head is right now. At first she wanted to show him the DVD to warn him, now she wants to show one to him for revenge? I don't get it. Which is it? I am not a Kate fan at all but what she is doing is very reminiscent of Carly but if It was Carly people wouldn't be as annoyed and they would say "oh that's just Carly." But with Kate it is a different story. It seems to be less forgiveable but people forget what Claudia did is way worse then what Kate has ever done. As far as I know she hasn't hurt anyone has she?
b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	No, I didn't mind the way they got their message across.  Actually, when Max bust into Jax and Carly's room and babbled on about healthy eating I thought it was hysterical.<br>  <br>  Gotta go now,   & pour a big glass of V8 Fusion  LOL|`|TCQP2iShaa	Myself and at least two other people have posted questions about this already LOL. If anything I definitely DON'T want to eat Campbells soup! It's for a good cause but it's soooo unnatural the way they just throw it into a scene and especially that dinner with Max, Milo and Diane. That was super annoying.|`|AA11068766	Well after watching all 3 soaps AMC, OLTL, and GH all week long doing rediculous product placement I am SICK AND TIRED OF IT!  I wore red for the Wear a Red Dress Day but come on!  I think doing it all week long - or several weeks long is a bit excessive.  Especially since this is the only subject that the soaps do product placement with- let us be lucky that so far we only have to deal with this once a year!  God help us if it happens more often!|`|YIcBd569aa	you  mean like reese cups or reese pieces? ha ha ha! you are so funny. it didn't bother me so much I hardly notice it on AMC. they have to pay the bills afterall and campbell is helping with that. besides I like v8 fusion mmmm! Yummy!!! and campbells really do make good soup! hey on all my children there is a cosmetic company called "fusion" maybe they will consider re nameing it V8 fusion.|`|5tjscWaZaa	You just gave me a buzz. I was thinking of soup earlier, but combine that with V8 fusion...Oh, gotta go.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I know, I was thinking to myself that some Campbell's vegetable beef soup sounds good.

zfi5EfFwaa	It will reduce the number of fans that he has, but some will blame this incident on the Rihanna or the media giving it too much airtime.<br>  <br>  For example, we see that Michael Jackson survived huge allegations with some fans denying that he did any wrong or blaming the parents of the children for allowing them to spend so much time at Michael's house.<br>  <br>  My point, die hard fans don't go away.  However, no matter what Chris is convicted of, many people will think of domestic violence when they think of him.|`|3ee6ad47525f6182f3bc56506cd6e698aa	I certainly won't buy or listen to any of his music. but there will always be guys that are into hitting women who will think he's cool.

YiBdz1Itaa	I think in five years you could extend your range to 5 octaves... But keep in mind your voice is still developing, and pushing it that far to the limit in such a short amount of time could be counterproductive.  I know you say you want to have a record deal when you're eighteen, but maybe focusing more on technique instead of simply how many octaves you can achieve would be more suitable.  You stated you have never had formal training... Talk to your vocal coach about this.  Most likely, they will discourage it because of your age.  Keep in mind that you can still attempt to get a record deal with only a 3, if not by that time, 3.5 or 4 octave range.  The average singer only has about 3 or 4 octaves after intensive formal training.  I have had lessons for almost four years now, and my range has naturally gone from 1.5 to almost 4 octaves, I just needed that push.  That could be the case for you, but it sounds as though your voice may already be at its limit, even though it may not feel like it to you.<br>  Just talk to your voice coach and take things slow... Keep in mind, while you pursue stardom, you can always continue to better your voice.|`|H2V0wLbqaa	Some people say it's going to take a ridiculous amount of training and practice to reach 5 octaves. However, I strongly think that either you have that range or you don't. JC Chasez certainly was born with that gift! :)|`|WJcH24xCaa	I'm not sure.  Because Christina Aguilera has a 4 ctave vocal range so it would be a lot of hard work getting there.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AQFwSLgiaa	I can sing 5 octaves.<br>  Just keep practicing. I taught myself to sing opera and now I'm in opera lessons to help make my voice more stronger. It is powerful but I want it to be even more powerful. It'll take a lot of practice and maybe 6 months if you really try and practice like everyday. The thing with most people they say they can sing up to 3 octaves, they're mostly are using their throat and not their stomach. Using your stomach is the way to sing, not from your throat,. You won't even make it if you always sang from your thoat. You usually have to be born with it and u prob do have one. So my advice is to get voice lessons. I'm in opera and I picked the most hardest thing to do but the thing is, it'll help you achieve the octave you want to go up to. If you take opera, you'll be able to sing all the voice types as well. So if you take it, you'll be able to sing pop, country but you'll have that powerful voice and the octave you want to sing up to. Good Luck! :)|`|XuFmnqSpaa	It would be kind of hard to tell, since I can't hear you sing! But, from what you say, it sounds like you have lots of potential! Definitely in 5 years you could reach 5 octaves! Keep practicing like your life depends on it, and you will get where you are going! Good luckk!

AA12390047	Your imagination  is better than the writers.  It's always the same 'ol, same 'ol.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	That sounds possible, but I hope not. I'd like to see Ray become a permanent character. I liked him when he first appeared and never did catch on to Vanessa. She's a tart. Christian's no better. His daughter confessed years ago to something that was planted in her mind. She has the right to be confused. I'd like Vanessa to be guilty.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I think Vanessa killed Ray's wife.|`|VAp5ICaBaa	I hope not I hope Ray kills Vanessa then this whole storyline can go away|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I agree that that would be an interesting twist. Vanessa just looks SO guilty! I can't stand her and hope that she's guilty of something or gets stabbed. I just want her gone!|`|D3Fyxj0raa	that would be interesting
33462b45e7f5e8fa0d2c9a98b11323c9aa	Yes..... his enemies could do that.   In fact, in a GH preview, it shows Anthony holding a knife or gun to Claudia, and I would bet that he just "walked right in" like everybody else.....  <br>  <br>   {somehow I don't think the writers give us any credit for having thoughts-- i think they just believe that we buy it the way they put it out there.....LOL.....}|`|aQCF1pqIaa	LMAO  i have wondered the same thing MANY MANY times! I mean I know abou tthe Kate thing but apparently at some point Jerry Jax also came in without people knowing to hide these DVD's. Jason has come in and out since the "fell out", Spinnelli has done it a few times, etc etc. It's really funny though, glad I'm not the only one who thought about this, and how come it never happens to Jason??|`|wQfo0thwaa	I agree.  And just how was Jerry Jax able to sneak in and plant all those clues for Claudia?  Jerry mentioned he knew that a wedding between Claudia and Sonny was planned, so he had to have been in there shortly before his own "death" wink, wink.|`|b6628937aefb808f31c908f368726c09aa	If you noticed, it has always been that way! Remember when he "always" had security on his kids, Michael was everywhere!|`|AA12315431	I wonder that everytime I see someone walk right in the back door. Even Kate said it was unlocked. Why is that door always unlocked? Where the hell is is security. Someone should be standing right outside the backdoor. What a joke. The writer's think we are all idiots.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Sonny apparently told his body guard many moons ago , and hasn't revoked it, that Kate can come and go any time she pleases, and she is taking full advantage of that green light.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Apparently Sonny gave Kate free range of the place. So she can walk around all she wants. But just her sneaking around and trying to catch Claudia in the act is just so lame. I use to like Kate...she's just so sad now.<br>  <br>  But, Im with ya everyone just kinda comes and goes as they please. I guess with Max and Milo trying to plug V8 juice and Prego sauce it's kinda hard of them to keep track of people lurking around the compound.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I know, where are these guards when Kate thinks she can walk into the house whenever she pleases?|`|msUIsv8maa	Thats a good one now that you mention it lol.|`|6efb881973246debd62243c5b0b3f7d6aa	I don't think anyone on soaps knows what a locked door is.  They do the same thing on a lot of them.

vV1hPhfWaa	Not sure what that might be.  Maybe you are refering to the artist Andres Segovia?  Listen to "Asturias" if you want to hear a good classical sound.
PeuFnqQwaa	Power Tabs and Guitar Pro tabs are specially written for software programs Such as Guitar Pro 5 Arobas Software. I think the site will still give you a print version. Not all bands play their songs with Barre Chords, though some use them quite frequently. You can just take whatever the chord is an play it as a Barre Chord, you can play majors, minors etc. Some chords used in some songs or parts of songs are simple Root 5 Chords (power chords). The tab you will get off that site is only as accurate as the person who tabbed it is. Most of them are not perfect, some are far from it. Look for Tabs with w 5 star rating, the more votes the better. This means the tab has been scrutinzied by at least the number of people that gave it 5 stars. This means its likely to be quite accurate.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	You have to have a program downloaded for PowerTab and Guitar Pro 5.<br>  PowerTab can be downloaded free I think, but you buy a disc at a guitar store for Guitar Pro 5. It's a great program.<br>  Any should work for knowing the barre chords they play if it's a good tab though (3.5 + stars I reccomend). On Guitar Pro and PowerTab you can have it play the tab too though.|`|2FIbamFgaa	If it's a band you really like, you may consider buying their tab book or something.  Online, tabs are hardly ever completely accurate. <br>  <br>  Like mentioned, another option is Guitar Pro, but you have to purchase to program, as far as I know.|`|hMpRCtFQaa	nothing is ever fully correct but tabs would be the closest.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	Guitar Pro, but you have to download it|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	I have Guitar Pro, and I like it the best, I usually find the best tabs from the Guitar Pro type tabs, also.

I'm not sure, I've never been to a witch doctor.|`|EuwjIJ3Zaa	No, they do not just counsel for cash. There are people in the world, that have managed to keep good hearts. Some people feed off of that concept to make money, and some people live by it, and in essence, feed themselves.<br>  <br>  Just learn to decipher between the two, and nothing else really matters about people after that.|`|ObnYA9lxaa	no such thing as real phychics<br>  OP is retarded

Dc9euMnpaa	Ok, I'll give it a shot trying to explain without writing a novel, haha. :)<br>  <br>  Starr (the teenage girl) has a connection with this teacher. She was recently pregnant and lost the child (or so she thinks) it was really stolen by Jessica Brennan because her baby died. Her teacher's mother was the one who delivered her baby. So her and Mr. Joplin have ties. <br>  <br>  Not sure what your talking about on the second one but I think your talking the Gigi's sister. The former exotic dancer. I'm not sure what's up with her yet, but it's something fishy.<br>  <br>  Cristian is not the one being framed by Vanessa. That would be Ray Montez (the girl's father) He was accused of murdering his wife. All eyes look towards Vanessa for framing him. Vanessa and her stepdaughter are from Columbia, they were not legal citizens of the US. So they were being deported back to Columbia. Cristian married Vanessa so she and her stepdaughter could remain in Lanview.<br>  <br>  I suggest going to soapcentral.com. They always have wonderful recaps.

Do yourself a favor and go to abc's OLTL site and read the recaps... There is much too much going on to even begin...|`|ADBMrG87aa	? The teenager is Star and she and her teacher Schuyler Joplin have ties because his mother was the pediatrician who delivered Star's baby and the baby supposedly died while in Dr Joplin's care so the doctor committed suicide and Star is grieving over the supposed death of her baby.  I think its Star who is more drawn to her teacher than he to her but it will probably lead to some kind of inappropriate relationship.<br>  <br>  ? The blonde who rolled her eyes is Stacy, Gigi's sister.  Stacy wants Gigi's man Rex and she will try to steal Rex from Gigi.  Stacy is definitely up to no good.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ? Christian who is married to Vanessa is totally clueless about Vanessa and her darkside.  Christian married Vanessa so that she and Lola can stay in the US.  Vanessa had framed Lola's father Ray Montez for the murder or Lola's mother so Ray Montez was in prison for that but he has escaped.  Christian will eventually learn the truth about his wife Vanessa but hopefully he and those he love won't get seriously hurt by her .<br>  <br>  <br>  ?  There's a serial killer loose in Llanview and has so far murdered Lee Halpern and Wes.  I suspect that the serial killer will turn out to be some psycho who is trying to kill off all the people who's hurt Marty in some way or another; maybe it will turn out to be Miles Lawrence, a psycho who's obsessed with Marty.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Go to abc.com/daytime and you can click on OLTL and get the whole scoop.

Brad froze to death.<br>  <br>  Sabrina was Victoria's best friend, who came to town, ended up marrying Victor, and was killed in a mob hit which was taken out on Nikki's ex-husband David Chow (they called Sabrina Ms. Newman, which is what Nikki went by, and so the mob felt they had Nikki as well)...  Sabrina was pregnant at her time of death, and her passing caused Victor to leave Genoa City, and hunt down the mob boss that ordered the hit on David.  The mob boss ended up dead, but Victor was still devastated, he ended up fleaing to Paris, Nikki sent Ashley to try to get him to return to the family, Ashley did get Victor to return to G.C. - but he also fell back in love with her...<br>  <br>  (Just trying to get you updated w/ story..)|`|LkTcLWTOaa	yes he did. noah was ice skating and fell in. brad died saving his life. sabrina is victoria's friend who came to genoa city, fell in love with victor and married him. she died soon after in a car accident so now victor has turned his attentions once again to Ashley.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, he did. & Sabrina was married to victor.

vVTupX6Kaa	Hey, congratulations! You've got great guitars! Sorry, I don't know much about electric guitars but I've definitely heard of how great the strats are.The Epiphone sounds like a really classy one. Isn't Epiphone part of the Gibson company? I envy you. It probably has a clear ringing sound with excellent timbre. Do you both strum & fingerpick? Hope you enjoy both in good health.|`|QXZiJo0Uaa	I have a Squier Strat, and I think it is awesome.  It has a good crisp sound, and I love the way it feels whether you stand or are sitting.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.

QMYNDtHgaa	he was being sexy, its called the old bait and switch.  You act like if a girl ever got to know who you really are then they wouldn't like you that way the naive dumb girl strives to prove the man wrong and in doing so gives him everything he wants.

His dad was also, but he also sexually abused him. Then he got out of jail and wanted to sell the baby to someone. He then went back to jail for drugs. I think ricky told grace that she would be scared to be in the same room with him because he is really sexually active because of his dad, and she is a virgin.|`|298f796fc155a4d211b7fdbc0307ec5caa	they sexually abused him :(|`|UHybukLiaa	they sexually abused him (his father)|`|F18BWwGiaa	His dad sexually abused him and put him in jail. now hes back and trying to take Amy's baby for adoption for some quick cash!!!

GsqQ4UTnaa	CBS Radio. the owner of 97.1 studios where Tom broadcast from, were unhappy with 97.1 overall ratings. The ratings weren't bad but CBS felt they could do better by converting the station into another pop music station.  I really miss Tom and everyone from 97.1 Free FM such as Frosty, Heidi, and Frank, Adam Corolla, everyone even Danny Bonaduce.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	Orlando still has a talk fm station, they probably don't have the cash to afford tom leykis, but then again they used to have stern, so anything is possible.|`|AA12337159	yeah their going through a format change, and it's a top 40 station, wich pretty much means their gonna play the same 10 songs over and over.<br>  right now their on a 10,000 marathon, but once they start taking calls and stuff i say all the free fm fans should flood the lines and deamnd free fm back!|`|Vhv1vyKWaa	Leykis and his syndicator, Westwood One, are parting ways.<br>  <br>  I haven't been following this closely, so I'm not sure if he will try to negotiate another deal with a new company or not.<br>  <br>  97.1 FM has changed formats to Top 40 as "AMP" Radio.|`|edJ5B0wnaa	97.1 changed format to top 40 and Tom Leykis and the rest of the lineup were taken off the air.Its too bad because it was an awsome lineup with top ratings but ultimately it had to do with CBS radio trying to save money.|`|nBqZBbtnaa	He got fired, cost too much money to have the entire day be talk. The station switched formats, they're now a top 40s station. It's complete BS.

If they touch their head nervously and ask 'what', just stifle pretend laughter and shake your head and return to the conversation.

zLzwaCpcaa	It is obvious that both have some talent within them, but it was a major shocker when the results came. Anoop Desai has a very unique and amazing voice, I felt that all of his performances were flawless. He has a wonderful personality perfect for an american idol. Not that Michael Sarver isn't a bad person. But I feel that Anoop is one step ahead of Michael. Plus, by watching Michael's performance I became more aware of the better talent out there in the competition. Anoop should have been in the top 12, he deserved it.|`|MbdwNsYwaa	The show isn't rigged... it's the public's voting! <br>  I agree with you... but hopefully Anoop will be the wild card from that first group of 12 and make it into the Top 12 !!! : )|`|kbxq8o9saa	LOLZ!<br>  <br>    YEAH!<br>     i think they're both good!~<br>     but i think Anoop was better!!!<br>  <br>     i just hope he could be chosen on wildcards to be on the top 12!!!<br>    *fingers-croSsed*<br>  <br>      XD|`|bTLwhwR3aa	Anoop was good! but i think ppl might have let him go...cuz of racism|`|rHrr7zmVaa	Dude, Michael S. is terrible, honestly, they'd rather vote for Tatiana, It would be fitting. geez, and Anoop/Ricky/Brent deserved it. How dumb are some people to even vote for that loser. They might as well crown Michael as the American Idol, how dumb is this show becoming?|`|4VWoIOIwaa	I wanted anoop in sooo bad<br>  i was shocked when he didnt make it!!<br>  watch this plez, youll see what a great singer he is<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_on7EOG8yk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_on7EOG8...</a>|`|mQlkWTkTaa	omg i know!!<br>  i was so sad anoop didnt win :[[[<br>  he was so good!<br>  I hate how america judges on looks and names instead of stage performance and talent. <br>  <br>  But theres still hope!

Michael just got the female vote. He's cute and that's why he went through. Based on their last performance, there's no way anyone could say Michael was better than Anoop. But Anoop may still get the wild card spot. I'm hoping so anyway. Even if he is a Tarheel.|`|aI4zVKuqaa	YES! anoop dawg was awesome! He seriously was great and the show is rigged. Paula slipped up one time check out wikipedia...Look at the controversy part.

Maybe better than the older guy at least.|`|47Jtrk3Baa	I don't think  Michael was that great his performance was not that good.|`|CoPpecGKaa	H*LL YEHA. i luv Anoop Dawg!! he was so much better!! i was so p*ssed off when he didnt make it!|`|zZPEoSngaa	Ya Anoop was good!|`|C33iBDzNaa	noop dawg was better for sure|`|wnPqeJoWaa	yeah|`|UF9MVdSXaa	100% Agreed American Idol is rigged! <br>  <br>  Anoop is wayyyy better than Michael!<br>  <br>  <br>  And do remember last year with Jason Castro's performaence and Paula said something about seeing it again??|`|eKxPSMolaa	I hate Michale Sarver. sorry to his 'fans'.  Anoop only lost because of his race. it's terrible but true. honestly, michale won't win. he's not a fresh face, or talent, that will sell. that's what  idol is for. Anoop was! he has a great voice and he was young. big mistake for letitng that happen.

vVTupX6Kaa	Yeah. I know what you mean. It can be frustrating. I do this with my classical guitar (nylon strings). <br>  <br>  Loosen the broken string by turning the peg. Take it out.<br>  <br>  Then put the new string (make sure it's the correct string!) in through the hole on the peg. Tie the other end of the new string to the bridge by looping it around over & over, securely. <br>  <br>  Then keep turning the peg to tighten the string. Now try tuning it, according to the strings next to it. Hope this helps.|`|E5aPfIaAaa	I have an electric guitar, but i am sure they are the same. Just in case, here is a URL to fixing it. (I hope you have extra strings!) To get it off, just pull the rest of the string out of the bridge (the flat part for strings at the bottom of the guitar), and unwind the other half of the string from the tuning peg.

3XnqfPfJaa	Blink-182 is the best band of the decade. Starting off the decade a year early with Enema of the State which was their fourth studio album and turned them into superstars with songs like Adam's Song, Whats My Age Again, and All the Small Things. After a few other singles and live albums they then released Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. This album showed growth and made Blink one of the most popular bands of their time with songs like First Date, The Rock Show, and Stay Together for the Kids.Those 2 albums made them one of the most influential bands in years. After those fun and many times acceptably immature albums they released their self or untitled album(they never specified) which was mature, deep, and simply a musical masterpiece. This album officiated Blink-182 as music legends with the hits I Miss You, Feeling This and, Down. The two singles they released that topped Billboards list over the decade were All the Small Things and I Miss You which were and still are considered to be timeless anthems. The band is back together now after a four year hiatus and is expecting to release a new album this year which would just further their reputation as the best and most influential band of this decade. Even with their recording success, Blink-182's greatness lies in their connection with the fans and their fun spirit. Furthermore, they have arguabley the greatest drummer of all time in Travis Barker and one of the greatest singing duos in a long time with the deep smmoth croon of Mark Hoppus and the high-pitched and melodic voice of Tom DeLonge<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  All Time Low was lists Blink-182 as one of their main influences as do bands such as Fall Out Boy, New Found Glory, and many others.|`|87MyNsNTaa	hayley williams from paramore's name is spelled haYley. just saying<br>  but i think all time low deserves it. they arent toooo well known but still they tour so much and have made so much success and are recording another album now i think. they are simply awesome. and they were voting atlpress's band of the year. just sayin|`|hd4dHvFPaa	Mother ******' Slayer! ...

lpyWVR2oaa	Certainly so..i wouldnt say the Rising sign is 'more important' but maybe more obvious and apparent than the Sun sign at times. In fact, the Sun sign traits can appear very subtle in some individuals, especially when other signs or planetary influences dominate in the character. <br>  <br>  Some astrologers give a lot of importance to the Rising Sign as it signifies the lens through which all our inner goals, drives and ambitions pass through..hence, the inner may resemble little of the outer after the 'filtering process'..i.e. the Sun sign traits may resemble little of the Rising Sign..<br>  <br>  And also, if the planet ruling the Rising sign is found very close to it, then the native would possess dominant traits from the planet/sign. As we age, we also tend to portray different sides of our personalities, sometimes taking on the Rising sign traits more than the Sun or Moon.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yes, but it depends on the person and how strong the ascendant is.|`|PyAgEejnaa	I wonder that too sometimes...considering when it comes to degrees, my sun and rising signs are neck-and-neck...and I read both horoscopes and both have been very accurate (not vague).|`|QZzQdh43aa	yes, i believe so<br>  since it's the front you put up, it's constantly what people see unless they really know you

I am a Virgo and i know for sure America is nothing like a Virgo, and if so then it would bore me like crazy. It is a good thing we are all different. According to the things foreign people say about America, the bad things are: the filthy fast food, the crowd that pushes you, the lack of respect and very easily you can be insulted as this country is free to allow that, and the mean people that are simply mean, and last but not least is the idea of being overweight as people seem to emphasize that a whole lot; including some celebrities such as Oprah, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, etc. I do sometimes love this country though, even with all the mud on it, I share no complain about it.|`|PyAgEejnaa	I've actually thought about this before...Cancer with Gemini rising sounds like a good idea. I feel like America may seem to be such a progessive place in some people's eyes (where Gemini comes in) but like a Cancer we still cling to tradition and like to be "comfy" in our old ways while trying to embrace the new at the same time...if that makes sense.|`|88nljACwaa	I agree. Gemini.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	It's really Cancer,but I would go with either Gemini or Aquarius.|`|47l1Sumeaa	America is a Cancer (Jul 4).

NEw5dsJlaa	I'm a Pisces, but I hardly ever find other Pisces women in social situations (we are all off in our own worlds). We Pisces girls are easily distracted, but when focused and intrigued by something we are able to immerse ourselves completely in it and become leaders in the field. Your Pisces is probably legitimitely sweet and kind, probably one to give all they have to someone if asked. Pisces has intuition which is almost like they can read your thoughts, for example I don't tend to talk much but I love to just "absorb" a situation or a person's presence. She probably will know more about you than you could imagine. Pisces emphathises with people in a bad situation, and are not judgemental against "freaks" and loners of the world. Pisces are loyal and generous lovers, the Pisces female is the most feminine and gentle of the zodiac and I've often read they are the most desired by men due to their submissive disposition.|`|lw1lrsstaa	i love pisces co-workers, they are very smart in general and they can help you if youre stuck, dont be frightened. for me, i just become their friend. theyre great friends always got your back and they wont cling on you like crazy, very understanding too not prejudice<br>  well about the too sweet part, my pisces friend told me before "kill your enemies with kindness" or something like that<br>  so either way friend or not theyre still gonna be sweet|`|becec0d758ca619d002cd53fed208102aa	They are hard to get to.

Ao5aSAWiaa	I saw a dance performance a few days ago that I can't shake. I started to cry a little in one ballet duet by these two guys, they were so beautiful together and so.... graceful!

3XnqfPfJaa	Frontman Dexter Holland spoke to a German magazine about this song, which was later translated on the Offspring forums. He said: "Kristy is about sexual coercion/molestation and is based on a true story. When I was younger, I knew a girl that was abused. I don't know whether I am the first musician to write about this subject, because it is obviously very delicate and anything but easy to make a song about such a complex theme. I also think or hope that this song speaks to other victims and can help them to talk or come out about their problem."|`|uFk8ohenaa	dk|`|0RCGy3OOaa	no, it's about taking a girls virginity before she realized what it was, and his concern that it changed her|`|fiTVTjUmaa	It sounds to me that it's about a girl that lost her virginity way too soon, and whoever is singing it is making sure that she's okay, and not just putting on a fake smile to make everyone think she's okay.

He lives with his mother, father, and fellow high school student Hiromi Yuasa who moved into his house after her father died. Her father had been a close friend of the family, so it was natural for Hiromi to come stay with the Nakagami family; one year has passed since she came to live in their home. Shinichiro has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shinichiro knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shinichiro teases her. After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box and finds out from her that she "gave her tears away". Shinichiro also likes to spend time with his childhood friends Miyokichi Nobuse and Aiko Endo at the Imagawayaki shop Aiko's family owns.|`|70pJeJ2Aaa	I RECOMMENCED U STOP AND DO SOMETHING WITH UR LIFE BUT<br>  VAMPIRE KNIGHT THE SECOND SEASON ARE GOOD JUST ASK AROUND AND SOME ONE WILL ANSWER  I DONT REALLY KNOW ANY ANIME NAMES JUST LEARND ABOUT THEM|`|gMjrfPJmaa	rosario+vampire<br>  tu love ru<br>  oran highschool host club<br>  sekirei<br>  eureka 7<br>  <br>  these are all good to the last episode.|`|fKcr6KU0aa	You've already got most of the ones I know of. :-)  Here are a few more, though...<br>  <br>  Bokura ga Ita<br>  Marmalade Boy<br>  Peach Girl<br>  Victorian Romance Emma (this one's really neat - it's set in Victorian England)<br>  Full Moon wo Sagashite<br>  Fushigi Yuugi (same creator as Absolute Boyfriend and Ceres)<br>  Princess Tutu  (...kind of?

lDBI2PoWaa	Ok well Jim and Pam got engaged in the season premiere.  He proposed outside of a gas station because he said he couldn't wait anymore.  Pam had gone off to art school in NY so they spent the first few months of their engagement seperated from each other.  Pam finds out she is failing a computer animation class and has to retake which would mean 12 more weeks in NY.  Jim tells her she went for a reason and she needs to come back the right way and he will support whatever she decides.  Pam ends up coming back to Dunder Mifflin because she didn't like art school.  So they are together and quite frankly a little boring.  They haven't really mentioned anything about when their wedding will be.<br>  <br>  Jan came into the office with her baby daughter Astrid.  They threw her a baby shower.  Michael realized he didn't really feel a connection to the baby since he didn't like holding her.  He however liked holding Holly.  Jan asked Michael to not start dating Holly but he does anyway.  Jan was only in the episode for the baby shower and hasn't been seen since.  Michael and Holly start dating and David Wallace finds out.  He transfers Holly to the Nashua branch and they consider having a long distance relationship.  Holly decides to end it though.  In the most recent episode Michael and Pam drive to Nashua for a lecture so he can see Holly and get closure.  Michael finds out she is seeing someone else. <br>  <br>  Angela and Dwight continue to be together even though she is engaged to Andy.  Andy is totally clueless.  On the Christmas episode Phyllis is the head of the party planning committee and bosses Angela around.  Eventually Angela says no and Phyllis tells the whole office she is sleeping with Dwight.  Eventually Michael tells Andy that Angela is having an affair and Andy and Dwight have a duel over her.  Andy sneaks up on Dwight with his Prius crushing Dwight into a bush.  Andy says something like I can't believe she's been sleeping with you this entire time and she's only slept with me twice.  Dwight gets upset that Angela slept with Andy and so neither of them want her.  And that is basically it!
k5P8XK62aa	I think that one of the things about being told by doctors that your life expectancy is a few weeks is that you don't tend to worry about things that will take decades to kill you (if at all).<br>  <br>  Several months after being given a prognosis of weeks to live, you might start questioning whether or not the doctors really knew what they were talking about.<br>  <br>  All things considered, I'd be more immediately concerned about the pneumonia that he's been diagnosed with (his chemotherapy will have given his immune system quite a battering).|`|cR1M8ALyaa	He's probably going to die soon anyways.

mD7eAAoNaa	I'd say Cancer moon (not because I have my moon in Cancer) but because the moon is the natural ruler of the sign. I think Cancer moon can be very caring, sensitive, possessive (to a fault), and nurturing. I agree with what Julianna said, that Fire and Air moons (not all but most) can be a little detached from family. My sister has Sagittarius moon and she has a different attitude towards family compared to me. For example, I cooked a family dinner for parents 39th anniversary and she just slept the whole time, only to come help after being called downstairs by my dad.|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	Gemini|`|lpyWVR2oaa	I have my moon in Taurus and though it's a favorite of many out there, I still have my share of difficulties with this placement .. but to a large extent, it's the hard aspects that this Moon makes to other planets that cause so much discord in emotions and intimate relationships... <br>  <br>  nevertheless, I am pretty happy with it and you can say it's my favorite - Taurus Moon is supposedly more emotionally stable than any other Moon placement and like its opposite Scorpio, we are deeply loyal and possessive of loved ones as well<br>  <br>  Running a close second would be Water Moon signs (esp. cancer) and I generally have a phobia of anything to do with the Moon and Air, especially gemini =P|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I have a Leo moon and I like it very much. It definitely describes me at times especially my inner me and what I'm like at home. <br>  <br>  My whole life I've always said "When I get married.... which will be when I'm 30... I will be the head of the household. No man will boss me around." <br>  <br>  I can be very bossy and demanding, especially at home. I don't think people really see the Leo moon unless they get into my most inner circle ( I have more acquaintances than close friends ) or live with me. I also have a lot of pride and when it is hurt, I can be manipulative and I say mean things i don't really mean!|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Sagittarius...Sign of wisdom.Very smart,takes risks,is lucky,knows how to have a good time,likes traveling and exploring therefore they have a lot of life experiences,they live for the moment,are super fun and positive.I just can't write here all of the positive qualities of a Sagittarius moon!|`|edJtHlDiaa	Aquarius moon or Libra moon.|`|wNruC52haa	Fire sign moon. They have sense of purpose and don't make stupid silly mistakes that made by water sign from being too emotional. Air sign moon is not very stable and some how distant and not affectionate. Earth sign they are normal. Not too emotional not too dry. Overall i believe fire sign moon providing a strong sun or rising sign will be very much stable and goal minded rather then being overly stupidly emotional when dealing with challenges of life. This is completely personal opinion. I might be completely wrong.<br>  <br>  Scorpio moon rocks ! They are 1 loyal powerful people :)|`|oSyCJs4iaa	Cancer is the Only True Ruler of the Moon<br>  And the Moon Rules Cancer as while<br>  Their are together as one <br>  When the Moon is in Cancer it is in<br>  The Powerful Position and state.<br>  And if you have a Air and a Fire Moon<br>  That means you are distance from famliy<br>  and not emotional<br>  That means the Moon is really a weak position not the best<br>  and if you have Earth Moon espeally Taurus it in a better position then Air and Fire|`|pDLZ6BGyaa	I'm not a big fan of Leo Sun, but Leo Moon is one of my favorites..they manifest the energy so different, and better in my opinion...|`|xEWVqdwnaa	i like taurus and capricorn moon

Your moon sign is how you react emotionally. <br>  <br>  I have a Sagittarius sun/Leo moon/Aquarius ascendant. <br>  <br>  I can see and understand what you said. In public, I am sometimes distant while to other people, I am friendly, playful and charming. Sometimes I will speak my opinons, other times I won't. I often don't show too much emotion in public either. In fact, I only cry a few times a year. <br>  <br>  I have a Leo moon. Even though I don't cry often, when I do lose control of my emotions, It is at HOME and not in public. Hardly anyone knows how bad my temper really is and when I'm emotionally unstable, I can be very angry, selfish, and arrogant. <br>  <br>  I also have a Sagittarius sun. I love to talk with my friends about anything... politics, current events, philosophy, anything.. ( but that could also be due to my Aqua asc. ) I can be very cheerful and happy. I love to laugh. I love travel.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	This is not true about the Moon being the inner you. Nor is it true about the ascendant or  Sun signs. The only way to tell is buy looking at the aspects to each. I have a Sagittarius Sun and Ascendant and a Gemini Moon but I am by more much more of a Sag. The reason for this is because I have more aspects to my Sun than I do to my Moon. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, My Moon plays it's parts but the planets have more effect on what kind of person I am. Aspects are always meaningful but the signs are not meaningful without aspects. Without aspects we can not tell if a person is going to display the good or bad traits of whatever sign that person is in. It's this misunderstanding about the importance of signs that has lead up to so much skepticism, and mislead many an astrologer. <br>  <br>  There are cases where the Moon or Rising will actually be stronger. Especially if the Moon is aspected to the Sun. Like my wife. She's a Virgo with her Rising in Cancer. She is much more like a Cancer than a Virgo.<br>  <br>  One great example is that I am enormously attracted to Astrology and pretty good at it too. Yet I have no Uranus aspect to my Sun or my Ascendant in longitude. But I do have a Uranus Trine Moon and Uranus parallel to my Ascendant in declinations.

I suppose around 300 is when it really starts changing into the sharper high quality. all through out the series it slowly changes as new animation techniques are used

MlCWsBcwaa	Well, I am having a bit of trouble finding a good reference to back me up on this one, but based on experience (from some of my family and other people I know): there seems to be I guess a genetic thing where some people with really black hair and usually blue eyes, with Irish heritage, and they tend to start to go grey/white pretty young.  Like I say, this is not backed up, but I think Eddie Cahill might have the same thing happening, rather than it being to age him.

cVQMVwmtaa	o ok.. the lady ran over her husband cuz there was something wrong with her brain. when derek operated he like accidently nicked the brain and so there was complications. when they were fixing that the baby lived and she died :( it was really sad cuz derek kept telling the husband it was all ok.|`|xv7YlV29aa	I won't be able to explain well...i'm not a medical person and don't know huge words like doctors lol.<br>  <br>  But what I got was McDreamy took too much of her brain out of her. There was only a tiny bit left and she would of been a vegetable. Addison was yelling at him saying she is dead and she needs to save the baby. There was a huge fight, the chief came. Thats basically it. Also has something to do with her losing too much blood.<br>  and high blood pressure or something..but yes mostly the brain part.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	She had an aneurysm, where her brain was making her act weird. Derek tried to fix it, but instead he nicked something in her brain, he then tried to fix that, but couldn't and she died! It was sad. :(
gYnPc42yaa	I honestly dont know! I dont even know if theres going to be a breaking dawn movie! omg. Because robert Patterson has only signed a contract for the first three movies! But if ther is a 4th movie I hope Kirsten stewart plays Bella as a vampire!|`|F0FByGiQaa	Of course she will still be playing Bella. Right now they aren't using a lot of makeup for Kristen in Twilight (and probably New Moon & Eclipse), so I am sure once she is changed into a vampire, they will put on a lot of makeup to make her look like a vampire. But according to Stephenie Meyer, there might not be a Breaking Dawn movie, because it will be hard to make a 3 day old baby that can talk and be knowledgeable of things going on around her look realistic. But CGI could improve a lot in a couple years, so they might be able to make it. <br>  <br>  Anyways, in this picture, Kristen kind of looks like a beautiful vampire. So they might just make her makeup like this if they do film Breaking Dawn.  <br>  <a href="http://www.independentcritics.com/images/random%20images/TOP%20100/kristen%20stewart%20100.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.independentcritics.com/images...</a>|`|b4ZDxiykaa	yea shell ply the part but theyll put pretty stuff on  her but shes wrked on twilight n she gona wrk on new moon so they just cant kik her out n pick anotha person to ply her|`|aace34040620b2c320bd0832346dda77aa	ok your twilight is awesome and yes i thnk she will stay on the movie if you look up pictures of bella vampire on google or anywhere u will already see her looking like one.  she is beautiful.  she will stay u cant just change main characters it will ruin the whole saga of movies|`|2741fde46711a1ff2d147a001460f6c9aa	She probably will, they'll just do her makeup like the Cullens'. <br>  <br>  It is unfortunate, however, because I really don't like her as Bella =/|`|GBOgsAoDaa	I hope not! Remeber that vampiers are suposed to be beautiful and pretty and kristen stewart isnt.
lioOtnbFaa	I'm pretty sure they dont have one coming out anytime soon. Their last cd "A Twist In My Story" just came out in Feb 08, and a deluxe version a few weeks ago. Dont expect anything too new for a while :)|`|Hb7e6Butaa	I don't think there's any news on a next album.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Cube (1997) <br>  <br>  It's part of a trilogy. Here's some information about all three:<br>  Cube (1997) the first movie follows a group of seven frightened strangers who find themselves trapped in a bizarre maze of cube-shaped rooms, with no memory of how they arrived there. Searching for a way out, they soon discover that many rooms contain lethal booby-traps, whilst others are safe. Initially the prisoners band together in attempt to escape, however as their stay becomes longer the prisoners begin to turn on each other as the stress of their imprisonment takes hold. Despite the film's low budget, it achieved moderate commercial success and has developed a cult following due to its surreal, Kafkaesque setting. <br>  Cube 2: Hypercube (2002) is a departure from the original. The dusky, dingy rooms of the first film are replaced with high-tech, brightly-lit rooms, and the conventional technology of the original traps are replaced with ultra-tech threats based on abstract mathematics. A new group of prisoners quickly discover that, unlike the original Cube, the rooms in their prison appear to shift instantaneously. They realize they are inside a functioning tesseract in which gravity, space and time are distorted. This time the prisoners each have a connection to the cube's suggested creator. <br>  Cube Zero (2004) is a prequel to Cube. Unlike the first two movies, which were limited to the prisoners' point of view, the film follows two characters, Eric Wynn and Dodd, who are technicians observing the prisoners. Wynn finds himself caring about the fate of Cassandra Rains, a woman in the Cube, and decides to risk his job and his life to help her try to escape.|`|GBOgsAoDaa	I think it might be " Cube"

And if you must, work out a solo ahead of time and play the same one over and over again. There's no shame in that either!<br>  <br>  As far as Bossa rhythms there are some basic drum grooves that work well, I would check out YouTube. I bet there are some drummers on there offering tips on basic bossa rhythms.

Your house of partnership is the 7th, and any planet  in there would describe the person you would see as a partner.  If Leo is on the cusp of the 7th you are looking for a strong minded individual with a lot of energy who will ground your idealism.  He/she may make you weary of parties just to be seen, when you want to change the world.  If there is a planet in the 7th, as I said, that would further describe the person you are attracted to.

Nq95TtCeaa	"Feelin' Alright?" by Dave Mason, better known as performed by Joe Cocker.  This song can be performed using only 2 chords. The two chords are A Major 7th and D Major 7th. If you know how to play them as "barre" chords on the 5th fret, its easier yet (at least I think so).  The way to keep the song interesting with only two chords is to add embellishments to it - throw in a simple lead guitar riff (if you can), otherwise just play your heart out. Most people I know would rather hear simple songs played enthusiastically than technically difficult songs played poorly. When you get to the point where you can play technically difficult songs enthusiastically and without errors, then you are on your way to stardom. You still have to know how to PERFORM, but if you can't play, you have to start at the beginning. No guitar player on Earth was a master of the guitar when they first picked it up.|`|KmG55jzraa	free fallin is very easy. it's just 3 chords

9RTuRPviaa	Wow, there are alot more Strokes questions lately.<br>  Anyway, i wouldn't think they'll be on tour until they have a new album out. Right now, we don't know when that will be. They are supposed to be writing new stuff soon if they're not already. <br>  I'd say just keep checking their website for updates.<br>  They've taken a break because:<br>  Albert, Nikolai, and Fab all had side projects going<br>  4 of them got married or engaged since the last tour (Julian, Albert, Nick, Nikolai) and Nick and Nikolai both have children.<br>  And the last tour burned them all out very badly (especially Julian)
nmYokULsaa	Well im an anime lover but i won't get mad if someone called it a cartoon. I guess we don't want it to be mixed with american cartoons. I don't like it when people say anime sucks because anime is part of my childhood,when people says that it just crush my childhood down to pieces.|`|cidwIuJRaa	Because anime is very important to us,and we feel the need to defend things that are important to us.<br>  <br>  Technically,they are actually Japanese cartoons,and anime is short for animation,which means that Japan even considers *The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show* anime.But,don't dare say that to us true anime fans.We know it is the truth,but we just hate hearing it.|`|i210xqkgaa	well do you not get mad when someone says something that you really like sucks without backing up their opinion? and the term cartoon refers to completely hand drawn animation, but has become more of an umbrella term over the years. anime refers to japanese "cartoons" which generally tend to be many times better than the crap that we make over here. i suppose you could compare it to a little boy who's action figures are referred to as "dolls" or. and calling anime cartoons is like saying a "barby for boys". yeah, you see how bad that sounds?|`|rc7GbYx9aa	anime and cartoon are different that's why they have a diff name and also anime is like my life and i wouldn't get mad that people say it sucks but they should keep their opinions to themselves it s not like i say "hey ur clothes look weird"  + maybe some people are just sensitive|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Lolz I know right?|`|VmXq5NCOaa	It's just like saying to a Disney lover that "Disney movies SUCK"|`|VtRbZiy1aa	Think about it this way.<br>  You have a girlfriend. You love her very much. <br>  People call your girlfriend fat and ugly and disgusting. <br>  It's just their opinion, but you would probably be pissed, right?<br>  Anime may not be in the same level of category as comparing to a lover but its the same concept. Anime fans are very into anime because<br>  they find that there are perspectives to anime that can't be found anywhere else, not even in other movies or tv shows. Anime is a different type of entertainment. <br>  <br>  So basically, you would probably get very offended if people thoughtlessly criticized your passion or love for something or someone, right?<br>  <br>  so there's my point<br>  <br>  also, moving pictures is called an ANIMATION, not cartoons. The definition of a cartoon is mostly directed  western animation that is hand drawn.|`|FBB1tbU4aa	How would you like it if someone insulted something you like. I'm sure sports fans would have the same reaction if I said their favorite team sucked.<br>  <br>  And no anime is not a cartoon. The definition of anime is-animation in Japan and considered to be "Japanese animation" in the rest of the world. In fact even the name Anime comes from the Japanese pronunciation of "animation". Comparing Japanese anime to American cartoons is like comparing the Dallas Cowboys to some random highschool team.|`|PYUVHnfMaa	Because for Anime fans it is not just simply a "cartoon" it is a Japanese Animation that should not be so low down as to be classified as a cartoon. They love Anime and that is just not right when somebody says Anime sucks. Also I am an Anime fan but you know I don't care if somebody says it sucks. I used to say that to but then I loved it. It is somebody's opinion if they think it sucks. Oh well.|`|NfA7nDQkaa	i see your point about the cartoon but really, who wouldn't get upset when they're being told that what they love sucks? <br>  <br>  i'm an 'anime-lover' but i don't get upset when i hear that people say it sucks. and it's not just that people say that anime sucks that bothers 'anime-lovers', it's when people go on to questions referring to anime specifically  and write anime sucks that's annoying.<br>  <br>  it's all just a matter of opinion.<br>  i don't like sports, maybe you do.<br>  i love twilight and maybe you don't.<br>  i like anime and, maybe you hate it, it really isn't all that important what everyone else thinks<br>  it's when people choose to be jerks about it that it gets irritating.|`|pgIcxpiaaa	hmmm.well,think of it this way..if you uber-love something and someone said it sucked..what would you feel?<br>  OR<br>  its simple.they get OFFENDED.

LwqM7EHVaa	I'm a bigger fan of Jim Morrison, but I have to admit, Syd Barrett is better when it comes to writing songs..|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	This depends.<br>  <br>  Syd was "out there" for that last few years of his musical career. Morrison wasn't. <br>  <br>  I personally enjoy Jim Morrison's work more, but Syd was a genius. I think it Syd hadn't of gotten so weird I think he would have easily topped all of Morrison's work.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Hard to compare the two. They were in totally different universes, but they were both geniuses at what they did. <br>  <br>  As a Pink Floyd fan, I love Syd, but he burned out so bad that it's actually painful listening to his solo albums after he got kicked out of PF. <br>  <br>  Morrison was consistently excellent until his death.<br>  <br>  So I guess I have to give the nod to Morrison, even though I personally like Syd better.|`|394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	Syd Barrett, as a musician and a human being. Syd was deeper, and yet able to be more whimsical than Jim, because Jim was always trying to accomplish the sensitive/ sexy singer-songwriter image. Also, if I had the chance I would have met Syd in person, and Jim, not so much.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Jim Morrison.|`|hZegT1raaa	morrison|`|V2PONyUQaa	Jim Morrison baby!<br>  <br>  "I am The Lizard King!

L4pDQM4Laa	unfortunately no, which explains the terrible ending that seems to cut the anime short...the anime was only set to produce 26 episodes where the story does not truly follow the story in the manga as it jumps around in the events that take place and there is no time for romance to blossom between tamaki and haruhi as it does in the manga...there are no signs nor will there be a second season to the anime but the manga is currently ongoing still with 68 chapters out, each chapter comes out once a month with about 35-42 pgs per chapter and onemanga is a reliable free online manga website in case you want to check it out...sorry!!<br>   heres the link:<a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Ouran_High_School_Host_Club/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Ouran_High_Schoo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Ouran_High_School_Host_Club/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Ouran_High_Schoo...</a><br>  Note: the anime is kind of different from the manga as in the storyline...the anime chose not to follow the mangas storyline so dont be alarmed if it seems different somewhat but there are still some correspondances between the manga and the anime.|`|rc7GbYx9aa	no they are not but i wish they do =]|`|LSn5iF47aa	No, they're not.<br>  <br>  But the manga is still ongoing. :p

wXv50mNEaa	The average single today is about three and a half minutes. That's basically always been true. There were plenty of long songs back in the day (think Dylan and prog) and there are plenty of long songs now (think post rock), they're just not singles.<br>  <br>  And what do you mean "not creative enough"? Are you saying it takes twice the creativity to write a ten minute song than a five minute song? So folk Dylan, the Ramones, virtually all blues artists, and many other renowned songwriters were not creative?|`|5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	I think the difference is that pop songs in the 1970's had instrumental parts with guitar solos. <br>  A lot of today's pop music doesn't have a solo part, or even humans playing instruments.<br>  <br>  I agree with Elvis that a song does not have to be long to be creative. In fact, there are lots of long songs that are unnecessarily long, basically just repeating the same melody over and over.<br>  <br>  To digress...<br>  In the early days of recording records were restricted to a short duration (about 3:00) because that's all the technology of the record could handle. <br>  Out of tradition, the pop songs stayed relatively short even though the technology has changed to make an 80 minute song possible.<br>  <br>  It wasn't until around 1960 that the LP record was created. John Coltrane was the first ( I think) to be happy about the new freedom. He recorded a version of My Favorite Things that was about 15 minutes long.<br>  <br>  If you think about it, the technology directed music history.<br>  What if the first recording formats had unlimited time for recording? What we consider typical, today, would very likely be different than what we have.

L4pDQM4Laa	oh yes the Bount arc.....dont bother watching that its only in the anime and its a whole annoying filler arc cause the writers as in naruto are so paranoid that the anime will catch up to the manga so they create these filler stories that have nothing to do with the storyline....so i highly recommend skipping it cuase its a complete waste of time and very disappointing tooo.. though it took up about around 20 ep or more and to make the story seem important they make filler references within the real story line to make it seem that its not a fller but anyways that doesnt matter cause it doesnt affect the story at all...there are currently 9 seasons and 203 episodes each ep comes out every thursday raw and sub comes out within a day...if you dont want to wait for the episodes to come i would suggest reading the manga at onemanga.com which each chapter comes out every thurs-fri and the site updates frequently there are over 300 chapters tho and no fillers-thank goodness....im all caught up with the bleach manga as well as the naruto manga and after reading that the episodes just pile on up so you can have an anime frenzy and watch a couple of episodes a night and still have more episodes to watch so yeah i would recommend reading it and when there are more fillers-believe me there is another pointless filller after the bount arc, so you can keep going on with the story without suffering the disappoint of anticipating episodes and asking yourself <br>  "when is this filler going to be over?"  it'll save you time and you'll reach the good parts and avoid the filler trap which so tempts you to completely give up on the anime=)<br>  <br>  heres the episodes list and names:<br>  <a href="http://www.tv.com/bleach/show/28625/episode_listings.html?tag=episodes;more&om_act=convert&om_clk=episodessh" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/bleach/show/28625/epis...</a><br>  <br>  and heres the manga list:<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Bleach/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Bleach/</a>|`|JBYq7dtXaa	the manga doesn't have any Bounts , just so you know i hate that part,  the manga sticks to the main story line the end...the anime does lead back to the main story line later but them suddenly may jump back into filler episodes then suddenly jump back to the main story its up to you if you want to continue the anime or read the manga...or you can do both|`|dYQUQGflaa	read the manga!! it doesn't have the stupid filler like the anime<br>  <br>  the bount arc is filler so it's not in the anime.

There are somewhere around 350 chapters (i think) and it doesn't take that long to read, so go for the manga!|`|6054ed19c32861b31ab1085f7f96bb9faa	no, there are no bounts in the manga.<br>  I like both. I usually skip the arc espisodes (bounts and other stuff). When the anime gets back to the main story line then i watch it.|`|ybjj5WIhaa	Yeah... the Bount Arc is not in the manga, it's a filler. Bleach has a few filler arcs. The Bount arc is one, the other is the New Captain Shunsui Amagai arc/ Princess Arc. You should try reading the manga as well<br>  <br>  As for the anime, just look up the Bleach episode guide on wikipedia or TV.com and skip the filler episodes. Even in the Arrancar arc there will be a few filler episodes.

JMK6fRV2aa	I was curious so I checked one of the most resourceful sites for movies. There isn't anything in progress, nor any bought rights to anything, so it seems very unlikely. Personally, I think they kind of milked the story to death, but then again...when HASN'T hollywood milked something to death?<br>  <br>  By the way, if you want to see if there are any movies in progress etc, this website is amazing:<br>  <br>  www.countingdown.com

AA12397801	No Naruto Shippuuden dub has not yet been released. The naruto trailers you've seen are just trailers that tell you that , that website will be posting new SUBBED Shippuuden episodes, straight from Japan, each week. So that the subbed version can catch up to  the japanease raw version. In wikipedia it says that the dub version of naruto shippuuden will be released later this year. Once regular Naruto is over, which my estimate is probably around April or May, they will begin airing Shippuuden probably in Cartoon Network or Adult Swim because of its more mature contents. Nothing is certain but I am certain that Shippuuden will be dubbed since the same cast has been chosen and the trailers have been dubbed as well. But the trailers, in my opinion shouldn't have been dubbed, because a lot of people became confused. Most people believed Shippuden dub would be coming out in January 15 but the truth was that they were just promoting that every week 8 new episodes, "fresh from Japan", would be subbed two hours after the premiere date in Japan and posted on the web. Not the dub version but the sub version. But don't sweat it because Naruto Shippuuden will be dubbed and released soon during this year. But if you really want to watch it try watching it in subbed. <a href="Http://naruto.viz.com/" rel="nofollow">Http://naruto.viz.com/</a> does have complete episodes but remember that they are not dubbed but subbed.|`|dYQUQGflaa	it is; they are from hulu.

a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	There are way to many signs to just have one clear one because guys show how they feel in many different ways...<br>  <br>  *How to tell if he likes you<br>  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.<br>  <br>  Shy Guys<br>  These are tough to crack sometimes...<br>  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.<br>  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it<br>  <br>  * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...<br>  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)<br>  <br>  *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...<br>  <br>  *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.<br>  <br>  *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.<br>  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.<br>  <br>  *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.<br>  <br>  *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.<br>  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).<br>  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.<br>  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)<br>  <br>  These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!<br>  <br>  *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, your favorite food is pasta..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.<br>  <br>  If you ever need anything else feel free to email me @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  *Much Love* ~God Bless~|`|e76b843f54cdf73253a7e63b14cae60aaa	Use the information below to estimate his capacity to enhance your metamorphosis as a young person to a healthy and well enabled information transmission life energy word abacus master 5 years from now... <br>  <br>  Think... will entertaining this guys interests make you the most powerful woman on the face of the earth with the most subtle and simple transmission of your power + knowledge?<br>  <br>  I want to take the audio files of the art of war and 48 Laws of Power explained audio books and put them so there are 200 to 500 tracks of those audio books and put them in a playlist so I can put it on random repeat playback possibly with playspeed modifications to longer or shorter tracks. <br>  <br>  So my question is which is the right 4, 5, or 8 CD version of the art or war that has many audio tracks like the "book" was originally written: IE: a series of loose notes one or three lines long, which also means not a WHOLE BOOK meant to be read Cover to Cover but random notes to be applied in sections of battle plans with modern measurements.|`|aTkpEHVsaa	signs:<br>  he flirts a lot and laughs a lot with you.  he apologizes a lot.  he talks to other people about you or calls you a lot.  maybe if he stares at you a lot or always wants to hang out.  and says sweet things to you.  or if he just tells you he likes you.  that works too.  you could always ask him|`|iL6XthhSaa	Well he will constantally look at u and try to talk to u or advoid u. he might advoid u because he might be scared. but try to flirt with him and leed him on|`|rNTcO6Zlaa	Here's a question for your question.<br>  <br>  How do you know if a girl likes a guy. *I'm oblivious*|`|ko2sdakhaa	just ask him... by text message or e-mail?<br>  or ask his friends?|`|hGO4rIyyaa	How do you kno if a girl likes a guy<br>  .....................<br>  shulda thort of dat|`|9rR8C7sWaa	he says "i like you"|`|f2f1533543e03966253e5dfdc62b7b19aa	jelloola's got it|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	Try flirting and see how he reacts.<br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkXazFTzwcBt5QysS7iuq2Hsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220174955AAaoVCt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RNBViGUjaa	well kinda flirt and see the reaction u get, there is this guy in my 12th grade american history class and he always asks to share the book with me (i have a boyfriend, shh so don't tell) but i share with him so he does take notes b/c he "forgot" to, so he asks to borrow mine, i let him and he doesn't give my notebook back b/c he wants a reason 4 me to talk to him, so if he kinda makes things up to get u to talk to him, then he kinda likes u, but me and my boyfriend have been together for 1 year almost, SO HAPPY ~good luck with ur love life~hope everything helped~|`|6ehYVOnuaa	When you ask "do you like me" and he replies "Yes".|`|VoKzvoxKaa	he checks you out|`|kNKj4uDCaa	keep in contact with him. go on groups dates like the movies w/a bunch a friends.

But interestingly enough, AI was originally Kubrick's project and he was all set to direct, and probably would have had he not died before it could be made. In my opinion, the film that Spielberg put together was mediocre at best (although the film was dedicated to Kubrick). <br>  <br>  Also, all of Kubrick's works were adapted to screenplay by him from novels. <br>  <br>  I know I sound like his manager or something, but I think he created works of such marvelous brilliance that the whole world ought to know about them. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't describe any of his works as "weird" or "inspiring", but I would highly recommend ANY of his films, the 50's film-noir "The Killing", 1957's anti-war film "Paths of Glory", widely recognized as one of cinemas indisputable classics, his "Spartacus" (the war epic) or "Lolita" (the highly comedic romance --although by no means a romantic comedy, and very risque in subject matter), the full-out comedy "Dr Strangelove". <br>  <br>  Then there's the science fiction (a horrible term that I hate to use to describe the film I consider the greatest ever made; the critics always put it in the top ten ever made, but it's usually not number 1) "2001: A Space Odyssey", the.. how do you describe it... fantastic piece of cinema starring Malcolm McDowell as one of the most engaging and repulsive protagonists in cinematic history "A Clockwork Orange", the absolutely stunning, brilliant, indescribable work of genius, his historical drama "Barry Lyndon". <br>  <br>  1980 meant the release of his glorious, mysterious, enigmatic and perhaps most dauntingly complex film, the horror "The Shining", (also likely his most commercialized film today), 1987's "Full Metal Jacket", which saw Kubrick tread absolutely incredible philosophical territory through the somewhat lackluster story told with enthralling ominousness. And the absolutely inconceivably great "Eyes Wide Shut", his last work, published in 1999... <br>  <br>  Utterly spent, he died four days after he finished the final cut.|`|jUty2TZPaa	Little Miss Sunshine<br>  Thirteen<br>  Confessions of an American Girl<br>  Saved<br>  Anywhere But Here<br>  Waitress<br>  Into the Wild<br>  On the Doll (Kinda explicit)<br>  This Boys Life

VRsFXHvPaa	Well, anything free is kind of illegal... but here it goes lol<br>  <br>  Get a torrent downloader, for example, BitTorrent or Azureus (almost all downloaders are free)<br>  <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bittorrent.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://azureus.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  <br>  Then go to a torrent download site, find Twilight and click to download it. It should automatically go to your bittorrent downloader. On a good connection, it should take about a day to download.<br>  <br>  Good torrent download sites that I like:<br>  <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/</a><br>  Isohunt.com<br>  Or you can choose yourself at..<br>  <a href="http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/peersharing/a/torrent_search.htm" rel="nofollow">http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/peer...</a><br>  <br>  The quality of the torrent is sheer luck. I would read the comments, if available, about the torrent. Usually people will comment about the quality.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't use peer-to-peer (eMule, Limeware etc) because these downloaders are for smaller file sizes. Torrents are made for much bigger files.<br>  <br>  I doubt there is a free clear version of twilight to watch online because it requires high bandwidth from the site, and I don't think the site will allow others to watch it for free... <br>  <br>  You could also rent the DVD, download DVDDecrypter from a peer-to-peer program (the internet download is banned/hard to find), save the .iso image somewhere on your hard drive, then burn it using Slysoft CloneDVD or any other DVD burning program onto a DVD. Most have best luck with CloneDVD.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! Thanks ^_^|`|kIpDDVc9aa	It's a bit difficult to find a high quality version of Twilight on the internet. There used to be tons on YouTube, but they were all deleted due to copyright issues. A lot of bootleg DVDs from Asian video stores come clear. If I were you, though, I'd wait just a bit longer.

It's the best quality version out there at the moment.<br>  <br>  You can find it anywhere on google. I will say this though: downloading it isn't safe. Many people have attached harmful software to it, so the file could possibly corrupt your computer. Not only that, but half of the kissing scene is missing, along with the credits, and the first 20 seconds of the movie the sound is muted. Sometimes the video is off-sync too, so their words don't fit their mouths.<br>  <br>  The only reason why most people download it is for video-making purposes. That is the only reason I've downloaded it, and I'll also be BUYING it since the download is technically illegal.<br>  <br>  If you want to have it just for watching, just pre-order a DVD online, and you'll have it in about a month in HD.|`|RIZqV5Zvaa	i was in the same situation as you the other night!

GAel6aReaa	I wouldn't care.<br>  <br>  its happened to me before. my ex hated me because I tried to keep her from doing meth and having bisexual affairs behind my back with her long time best girl buddy. <br>  <br>  we split, she kicked me out for being to controlling and then she kept my stuff from my underwear, to my razor for shaving, to my bed, to my computer and to my personal things like even my old wisdom teeth that came out of my own head., that I was saving. <br>  <br>  I had to take her to court to get all my stuff back. she didn't even show, and it was me against her mom. her mom agreed I should be given the stuff back and I later had police escort me to get my stuff. my ex wasn't there.<br>  <br>  4 years later, one of my contacts on myspace informed me she was getting married. so, I sent her a message in peace, congratulating her on her new wedding. <br>  <br>  well, she wasn't having any peace, and accused me of stealing "her stuff" and threatened legal action........<br>  <br>  yeah so.<br>  <br>  she moved away during those 4 years, I did have feeling for her still, but by that time I had already moved on and was in a relationship with a true friend that knew me during the times we used to date and even before her. <br>  <br>  point is. ya gotta move on, because other people usually don't feel the same way you do. let go and experience life instead of sulking in the past.<br>  <br>  they are called ex-s for a reason.<br>  don't ever forget it.|`|hbUaDewPaa	hunt the ho down, off her<br>  chapter 2 begins.|`|wY4PmhHFaa	haha im not lesbian|`|QbOYIixuaa	SHE'S YOUR EX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Uv6fADcaaa	I did that to a guy, once.<br>  <br>  We didn't talk for ages, and then one day I called a friend back hom, and he was at his house...<br>  <br>  we started talking, apologized to eachother, and we are still friends years later!

I'm trying to point out to you that this isn't your fault... <br>  <br>  try getting out of the house as much as possible... with moon and rising in capricorn you would really love being immersed in a job of sort... if you aren't old enough then just do anything you can to keep yourself busy... <br>  <br>  ~peace|`|d9hzMrzwaa	i agree with you all the aries i met were pretty mean to me|`|wNruC52haa	Why are they so pissed off with you in the first place ?

Some people love earth signs whereas I do not like them very much etc...<br>  <br>  I guess you see them as "mean" because they push your own buttons and you get offended.<br>  <br>  I do not know..........they are never mean to me..maybe because they sense ( the lower kind of Aries anyway) that I could blast them off very quickly...|`|mka6cRCWaa	yeah aries like to abuse people, they are violent aggressive people. it's not you, it's just them - they have deep issues within themselves and it's always a constant struggle with themselves. they have big egos and like to degrade people to make themselves feel better.<br>  <br>  just ignore them, live your own life, once you finish highschool (ur in highschool right?) you can move out.<br>  <br>  just remember, it's their own loss if they don't want to talk to you like a normal parent would want to. you've done the best you can do, it's up to them to realize how horrible they are and to change.<br>  <br>  good luck and hope you live a great life!|`|sIJ6jxNdaa	i hate aries in all the schools i went i had problems with aries but only the aries girls the boys i don′t know so they are mean because they want to make them big or important than you i had 2 aries friends and then i don′t know why they started hating me because i was more popular i had better grades than them and some other things i don′t really know about parents but just ignore them <br>  hope that helped you and sorry you are treated that way i hope you will have a great life, i really understand you now because of them i have just one friend

Whenever I think of the best films of recent years I always pop PT Anderson's masterpiece on top of my list.     I could go on and on about the terrific writing and direction. The amazing performances by Julianne Moore,Philip Seymour Hoffman,William H. Macy,Melora Walters ,Tom Cruise and a touching final performance by Jason Robards. The amazing Cinematography of Robert Elswit and the score by Jon Biron were remarkable.    However, the one thing I did not see mentioned above was the remarkable contributions of Aimee Mann whose songs inspired a key character and really hold this three hour epic together. Thank God for Anderson, who helped to garner attention for Aimee's music.     I had a terrific opportunity to meet PT Anderson at the SAG screening of "There Will Be Blood". I just had to shake his hand and tell him how much I am particularly touched by the use of music in his films.|`|dYyiG90caa	"These Things DO Happen !"    One of my all-time Favorites.

Anderson -- Also one of my Fave Directors.    Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, and did he do There will be Blood ?

Great performances of great characters. A cool story. Well put together. One of the best ensemble movies I've seen, and definitely my favorite PT Anderson flick.    It's funny that you mention it actually because just yesterday I answered a question about Tom Cruise and how Magnolia is the best work he has done or will ever do. He just couldn't possibly do better than he did in that flick.     I really need to watch it again.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	I was totally captivated by it as I watched, but then came the frogs.|`|h2HxsSJ5aa	I like the interconnections between everyone, which aren't in your face at all.  I also identify with the quiz show bloke because i was a gifted child and an underachiever.  The climax of the film and the singing are my favourite bits, and they do make sense despite what everyone says.  There are hints all the way through that that is about to happen.  Some people find it too long though.

qswrz268aa	Try the ghost method!<br>  <br>  So what it is is narrow the part where you want to jump, then play the note before the jump, and then jump to the note, but don't play it, just covers the keys... Do that 5 times, and then actually play it. Repeat that process about 5 times, and you'll have it down.This method helped me work wonders many years ago when I was learning Rachmaninoffs prelude opus 23 number 5. If it wasn't for this method, I'm sure I would have never learned that song... or piece. :]<br>  <br>  Good luck! Have a great day!|`|951tTsRQaa	I think it depends on how fast you need to jump.  If it's as slow as that song, you can do whatever is comfortable.  If it's faster, I would think it would be easier to play the first note of the chord with your middle finger, the second with your index finger and the top note with your thumb.|`|DiuhDU6xaa	As for the jumps, just keep practicing, there isn't really a way to make that easier. For the chord, it would be most comfortable to play the lowest note with your pinky, middle note with your middle finger, and the highest with your thumb.|`|FpWXuzH7aa	Keep yourself relaxed especially the wrists.Take a look at Alkan's Allegro Barbaro played by Jack Gibbons.He does the octave jump on both hands pretty well and its at a pretty fast tempo.I'm doing it as well and all I can say is to keep the wrists relaxed and look ahead at the keys to place your fingers to give yourself a "head start".

Rick Ross is a way better mc than 50 but he should have come clean about bein a C.O. from the beginning, fif is taking it kinda far tho, i mean he got ricky's baby momma talkin bad about him online and he takin her shoppin at what not thas crazy. 50 did go a lil far i thought by talkin bout his mom, but hey it is a beef|`|9wUrbqT3aa	Yeah its entertaining....  I cant beleive 50 interviewed Ross baby mama.  50 is exposin him as a fake dude that doesnt even take care of his own family.    U can hate 50 or love him... but a failure he is not.  Albums sales, to investments, to stayin relevant.... have all been successful.    And Ross talked about 50 baby mama first.  Sure 50 is going over board... but Ross asked for it.  In an interview he talkin about he wanted to fight 50..... 50 is a street dude (Preme dont send guys to kill u if you aint a street dude)... u dont threatign street dudes like dat|`|bribxhsdaa	Ross looks like a really dirty Buddha. The only thing i respect him for his his beard.    50 Cent looks like a gorilla. The only thing i respect him for is the fact (If he could catch me) he'd beat me up quite badly.    Ross was a C.O. who stole the legend of Freeway Rick Ross    50's rep for a 1/3 of his career was "snitch" who stole the legend of the original 50 Cent who apparently was buddies with Rakim.    They both need to have a pint of Guiness each and shut up.     Beef in hip hop is dead...The disses nowadays are the kinda thing my little brother says to gaffots his age while some kid with milk bottle glasses goes "OHHHHHHHH"    Gaffots.|`|98wFqBwSaa	"50 Cent is so predictable, He should just die already."    LMAO!!    All jokes aside, Ricky is better than Fiddy, despite him being a former corrections officer.|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	They're both lames so no I'm not entertained by it at all. I just know that 50 should've kept his mouth shut about Wezzie F. Baby...he made himself feel big when he smashed Ja Rule out the game but he won't be able to do that to everyone he says something about. Especially not Lil Wayne.|`|bPnmavjZaa	Rick Ross is a better MC than 50? Yall definently gotta be from the south. I guess u have not listened to 50's albums. 50 is known worldwide and the record sales aren't even close. A real MC does not need an R&B hook on every single. I respect Ross but beefin with Fif is like suicide. Ja Rule, Camron, and Fat Joe can all attest to that. And the only reason Game is still relevant is because he has real lyrics. He will go that extra mile to expose and embarass u. And with Rick's questionable past, he is an easy target for Fif. 50 has too much money and too many connects to be fcuked with. With all this negative press, I guarantee Rick will push his album release back. And as far as him being a failure, the dude is worth more than $400 million. If thats a failure, I wanna be a failure|`|ArzbT9pzaa	"Fat n**** playin' Wii Fit Nintendo.." Bahaha! That  made me laugh.  I think Fif is gonna Ja Rule Rick Ross' career, just you wait :)|`|kuxVB76maa	I'm not even paying attention. 50 Cent's doing this beef to grab attention for his next album.|`|AA12371207	NO, its stupid and 50 is annoying|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I don't pay attention to it.  And neither of them are living up to their potential.  Both could do better lyrically but choose not to.    EDIT**  I never said 50 would ever be a GOAT but he can do better.  We have heard him do better than he is doing now.  He's caught up in the bankroll project.|`|KoNHUcNUaa	This is a true "the pot calling the kettle black " beef. 50 thinks if he starts beef with him, it would look like he doesnt deal with cops. BS. This is a stupid beef and a publicity stunt for 50's wack @ss album coming out.|`|aJfBtT9iaa	i find it pretty damn funny yes but i dont really care about neither they are both equally fake.|`|4w9gmvumaa	Thats hilarious how she was drinking that Vitamin Water!  That is so messed up the way Officer Ricky took her truck from her out of the parking lot (during the child support meeting) when she was on her way to pick up their son from daycare.  What a loser.  He gets no respect.    edit:  50 has a strange sense of humor.    edit:    I can't believe 50 got her the book deal to release her book on the day his album drops.

rWgAmkyXaa	Like whatever you want. At least they're not Creed . .|`|5dc42237ea103510238126df59d3a8daaa	Who cares?|`|3pYmSOtaaa	Sorry, but being a Coldplay fan, they're definitely not Christian music. Viva La Vida is about the French Revolution or a king who's lost his kingdom.<br>  <br>  I'm raised Catholic, but I don't follow it. I listen to The Fray, Coldplay, OneRepublic, and other bands that are similar. No bands are intended for a SINGLE, certain religion only. Anyone can listen to them.|`|kA09uLdsaa	Yeah its fine, I mean you won't get in trouble for being a Non-Christian and listening to it.<br>  <br>  But maybe you will learn more about Christianity by listening to them and change your mind about it =]

MFPAyL2Raa	Wow I hope not. I wouldn't be able to take her seriously . .<br>    She may be trying to get a part, but I don't think she would actually be in it - The movie is aimed for teenagers first, other audiences second. (That's why Edward is so freakin hot)<br>   I think that Madonna is a bit old to be on New moon. Im not certain though . . . <br>  <br>  p.s. Apparently the Jonas brothers want a part, too - on the soundtrack, I mean.|`|J0G4lRrNaa	Why would she be singing in New Moon, as part of the soundtrack?<br>  <br>  I hope she doesn't, they should stick to having small actors and actresses play roles.<br>  <br>  I hope it's not true!|`|f3yFRJ3maa	NOOOOOOOOOO|`|ITRVyKlyaa	No. I don't think so|`|mQBwQKtOaa	i haven't heard anything like this!

8ad6fQiNaa	It did get a lot better. The characters are finally interacting with one another instead of just running around on their own not talking to anyone else. They've gotten rid of character driven stupidity as well. Peter isn't so naive anymore (Nathan: what powers do you have now?, Peter: What are you a cop?) and he isn't ready to easily trust.       My biggest problems were clairs make-up, she looked like she works at "Scores". I'm also worried about what they're going to do with Sylar.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Up until the last 10 minutes of the show, both my husband and I were like, this show is gonna get cancelled, because the direction of the show was wack. Towards the end, our impressions had changed. I LOVED the scene in the airplane and was sooo hype. lol So, my outlook is positive. If they don't explain how Ando got powers, I'ma be upset, tho. That was the main issue I had with yesterday's show. I'm not a fan of all that backtracking but too much has happened to not have to explain it.|`|qvAwxA3Xaa	10 it is|`|dfSrcJjhaa	It had to get better since it couldn't have gotten any worse.|`|K1GYtYryaa	I think it will be a lot better. I read they brought back writers from the amazing first season to help them from getting canceled.  When saw the commercials for the new season i was instantly excited.

36f84822e49a2b5137af715c3fe5087aaa	ive seen slumdog and BB...personally i did not care for BB as a movie...it was way too long and it could have been so much better if it had a director to push the envlope--i can imaagine if tim burton did it, it may not have been up for best pic but it would have been so much more entertaining..otherwise in all the technical categories it was very good-brad pitt was great the visuals+cinematography was fantastic-it just wasnt that great overall as a movie..id give it 6.5 out of 10<br>  <br>  slumdog was very good.  i dont know if it deserves best pic, but i really enjoyed it..not as technically good as BB but much more enjoyable...id say 8.5/9 out of 10<br>  however out of the 50 or so 09 movies ive seen the dark knight is by far the best and i beleive it deserves at least a nomination more than many other movies, namely the reader, which did much worse with both fans and critics than TDK...it was a monumental achievement in cinema and was nominated for the 3rd most oscars this year-but left out of best picture which is stupid|`|pUIGCtaZaa	Slumdog Millionaire was AMAZING and Sean Penn was PHENOMENAL in Milk!|`|qxdUzCCDaa	'Slumdog millionaire' ROX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  love it! it is really sweet and nice...|`|EKuAVaXsaa	nopee|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Slumdog Millionaire will probably get the Best Picture award. I personally don't think it should but its just one of those movies that the academy likes to award. My personal favorite was Milk. Frost/Nixon was pretty good but not as good as all the other one's. Benjamin Button was really good but not as good as Milk.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I think Slumdog was a great movie, but I don't think it should get best picture. I think it deserves the nomination but not the win. I wouldn't even say it's Danny Boyle's best film. <br>  <br>  But if you were gonna go see two I'd say Milk and Slumdog.|`|52f7584a0ca6651ca7209f1498e07a0caa	No, Pinky, although I did get to view 3 of the 5 nominees for Best Animated Short Film. I was 4tunate enough 2 c on YouTube "Oktapodi," "Lavatory (Lovestory)," & "Presto" (which I also coulda watched on the "Wall-E" DVD that my baby sister has.) "Lavatory" had simple graphics but was the longest of the films. "Oktapodi" I think will win based on sophistic8d graphics & animation.

Maybe not make you completely deaf but you will have to crank the volume up farther and farther the more you loose your hearing, reason why alot of musicians have hard hearing, reason they wear ear plugs while performing alot of times. But short term when I listen to music in my car for like an hour at a time, and I finally do get out, my hearing will be a tad lower with my ears hearing a high pitch I guess you would call it. I know better, but I cant help it, I love bass, and I cant get enough of it, I really cant, its like a drug to me. people say thats loud, but I just cant feel it enough. Sometimes I'll place my face and ear right on the sub woofer where its pumping out just to hear and feel it.

I can't believe anyone would take such a huge generalization seriously. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'd have to say a good 60% or more of my library is from female vocalists - I simply prefer women singers more. I don't know why, they just sound better to me. Here's some bands/artists that I like:<br>  <br>  Metal - Aesma Daeva, After Forever, Annatar, Nightwish, Lumsk, Lyriel, Antonamasia, Cadaveria, Elis, Eyes of Eden, Flowing Tears, Lacuna Coil, Octavia Sperati, Krypteria, Benedictum, Kittie, Otep, Sinergy, Madder Mortem, <br>  <br>  Rock - Animal Alpha, Catatonia, Garbage, Jack Off Jill, Kate Bush, QueenAdreena, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Rasputina, Stolen Babies, All About Eve, Guano Apes, <br>  <br>  Pop - ágnes Vanilla, émilie Simon, Uh Huh Her, Carola, Chisu, Irina, Jenni Vartiainen, Kikka, Kristiina Brask, Indica, Sissel, Sarah Brightman, Delta Goodrem, Regina Spektor, Vienna Teng, Dido, Maria Mena, Rachael Yamagata, Sia, Sixpence None the Richer <br>  <br>  Hip Hop/R&B - The D.E.Y., Jamelia, Bahamadia, Gloria Jones, Diana Ross, Roberta Flack, Mariska<br>  <br>  Other - Amanda Palmer, She&Him, Ordo Funebris, Loreena McKennitt, Hannah Fury, Jill Tracy, Pretty Balanced, Natalie Walker, Goldfrapp, Operatica, Morcheeba, Kidneythieves, L'?me Immortelle, Zombie Girl, Dargaard, Emilie Autumn, The Birthday Massacre, Allison Krauss, Tarja Merivirta<br>  <br>  <br>  Okay I'll stop but based ONLY on what /I/ like, I'd say there are at least 600 artists/bands in my music library with female vocals. So there are plenty out there to choose from...it's not as if all female singers sound the same (and if you think so, then please widen your horizens.) They're not all high operatic singers, or bubbly annoying ones. There's plenty out there that sing low and husky, or soft and sweet. There are female growlers and screamers. There are PLENTY of different sounds out there. In fact, I thought Veronica Freeman of Benedictum and Helen Vogt/Stefanie Duchêne of Flowing Tears were men the first time I heard 'em.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	Since I appreciate good music of most genres and styles I'd say at least 30%.

Xc02z608aa	I vote for Abby.  Having seen the actress that plays Eden on a different show I know that she has the capacity to play different characters.  The girl who plays Abby is just plain bad.  I think my cat could do a better job.|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	I think both are bad but for me Eden takes the cake.  She has the same over the top facial expressions that the last Eden had.  For me she can just go away.  I do not like her character.|`|5n3Wm0LGaa	lol    I agree, Abby is pretty bad, and Eden is horrible ( and isn't this the SECOND Eden?)    I just don't get it. There are so, SO many talented actors just taking any little part they can get--why would THEY get the parts?|`|30r4coInaa	Unpopular opinion:  I like BOTH.    I actually think they both have potential... (please don't send the mob after me!)|`|uwds1QuVaa	Abby.  Why did they have to make her character such a spoiled little brat??  I liked the younger actress Darcy Byrne, who played her, much better.  She was terrific!  And the girl who plays Eden was much better on Gilmore Girls!|`|a05bf379e42804bb52c81241ef0d2a49aa	Abby|`|lv1dT7BQaa	I dont care for either one the new Eden is no way as good as the old one,she played the role so much better|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I agree with Scott, they're both fine IMHO.|`|houWY7qvaa	Eden.|`|Xgn57WGfaa	This is a hard choice both are pretty bad, but I would have to say Abby|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	I think Eden is the worst...did you see yesterday's episode??? when she hugged Michael and cried...that was pretty horrible!!! Abby is just a snotty spoiled brat, I think.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I can identify with Eden, and I can see all that she's lost, and how she's trying to cope.  She was a free flier at the compound--she grew up following her whims.  I like her actress very much.  Snapping dark brown eyes--she's beautiful.    Abby on the other hand--I don't like the character.  It's hard to like an actress when you can only see the snobby snot she's grown into.    TX Mom|`|FwU6GL4Laa	Cant choose between those 2, the neither one can act...they try to hard and it comes off as fake.|`|0ffdb9dc23ea4daa66d018dcdabc0a14aa	That is a hard one..both are pretty bad. You should throw Colleen in there with thoes 2. She is bad actor too.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I think Eden is the one, she is just as fake as the previous Eden, the elevator is not working right for her.    LOL|`|F93FZyo1aa	wow thats a hard one! lol     i would say Eden (both of them)...cant stand to even listen to her voice. Abby is just a stuck up spoiled brat.

52f7584a0ca6651ca7209f1498e07a0caa	Either Rourke or Penn. If Frank Langella wins, perhaps that'll erase the memory of him as Skeletor in "Masters of the Universe." Could b just me, but if you're gonna bet on Richard Jenkins to win, perhaps the Houston Rockets, San Jose Sharks, or Xavier Univ. will win championships this year, 2.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, I got 2 view 3 of the 5 nominees for Best Animated Short Film on YouTube: "Presto," "Oktapodi," & "Lavatory (Lovestory)." "Oktapodi" will win based on sophistic8d graphics & animation. "Lavatory" is 2 long." "Presto" is a superfluous win for Disney if "Wall-E" hasn't won already.<br>  <br>  Perhaps there'll b superfluous rejoicing in South Asia if @ the same thyme the Slumdog collects all them Oscars, either "Smile Pinki" or "The Final Inch" wins Best short doc.

N1stgM5Aaa	Ahaha, I'm sorry I had to star this question - made me laugh ^__^<br>  <br>  Lol, let me start off by saying that I hate the little egotistic bastard and I despise him for killing Itachi. However the fact of the matter is that any girl in Naruto is willing to do Sasuke. I mean, you probably witnessed the way that Sakura and Ino were fawning over him in the beginning. And they still want their "Sasuke-kun" even though he willingly gave his body to the pedophile known as Orochimaru... Tch, the way Karin obsesses is annoying. Pftt, I have no effing clue why the girls like Sasuke -- but as it stands, any girl is willing to do him. Well that's if Sasuke isn't *cough*GAY*cough*... =w=~|`|mtuZ3i7haa	You have a point o.o<br>  And actually, its one xD|`|mE1YiekAaa	there are other ways to revive your clan then just have smex. i think he just wanted to revenge it...<br>  but as of my knoledge sasuke was narutos lover :D<br>  *shot*<br>  <br>  some may call it gay, Kishimoto calls it plot ;_;|`|clrYAxgDaa	I don't know He might get pissed at Paine for doing it. I also saw this realistic page of the LAST CHAPTER of shippuden. Sasue and sakura were married and had a son who wanted to be a big bro and then sasuke stared at that mountin with the kages and narutos face was on it and it had a faded pic of naruto in the outfit he is using currently. on the bottom there was a side note that stated: I promised myself I wouldn't do this; I think the author wrote that.|`|Rkavqbaaaa	Sasuke only appears to be asexual ;] He is male though. And, like all males, he has needs.<br>  <br>  You have to think about this. Do you really think Karin hasn't already whored herself out to him? He could easily get any girl he wants to bear his children.|`|iLDullXeaa	he cant thats the problem<br>  hes gay.|`|b6VH0ZIJaa	ok dont worry im a pro first you lay wif him in bed then tug his pants in a calm voice tell him take it of then lower hands and hold that cock play wif yours and his together and use toys have fun lol put me as best aswer! im funny

IX4mSxEMaa	I think you might be thinking about Magical Angel Creamy Mami, but she does not gain super powers in literal sense.  She merely transforms into an idol called Creamy Mami, and is able to use the magic to deal with any supernatural phenomenon.<br>  <br>  Also  when Toshio accidentally saw her transform, she did not turn into stone, but the transformation stick turns into stone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Angel_Creamy_Mami" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Ang...</a><br>  <br>  Also just watch some episodes and you'll see she transforms while drawing treble clefs

WjYEIlYraa	HORRIBLE, im so disappointed with piccollo.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	meh... i dont like it. just by the trailer it doesnt seem like goku's the carefree guy he is in the anime series. piccolo looks like something out of a bad, low budget alien film. i'm going to be very skeptical about this film.|`|hxoawGwZaa	Well...they look awfully terrible but that doesn't mean that I'm not giving this movie a chance. I'm going to watch it then judge it, though I'm quite sure that I know how my reaction would be.|`|unhbIEUpaa	They will ruin the Dragon Ball universe. The cast is...sooo weird that is not even funny. Roshi....has hair....since when? Krillin is missing...because of course, he does not matter....Piccolo looks just...retarded. And of course, Goku is.....who knows what he is. <br>  Here's my dilemma though: It is not DBZ since they talk about King Piccolo, but at the time when all that goes on in Dragon Ball, Goku is a kid. He doesn't grow up untill DBZ, from what I know. <br>  To make it short.....i'm expecting it to be one of those movies that screws everything up.

AA12397801	Don't worry dub anime is AWSOME. I hate watching subs too. =] But anyways I'm estimating that it will premiere during April or May on Cartoon Network or adult swim because of its more mature content. But it all depends when Naruto ends. Naruto on Cartoon Network has not been premiering regularly lately so it's kind of hard to make and exact estimate of when Naruto Shippuden is going to premiere since sometimes it takes the next new episode of Naruto one month to premiere on Cartoon Network. But don't worry the same cast has already been chosen and wikipedia states that Naruto Shippuden in english dub will premiere sometime during this year. I pretty sure that it's in the process of being dubbed. All there's left to do for the naruto fans to watch Shippuden in english dub is to wait for it's release on T.V.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|Ud0xlHVyaa	Eww... dub? Watching anime tht are sub are wayyyyy better than actually watching it in english. The american version fucks up everythng. Like in One Piece Sunkiss suppose to be smoking not licking the lolipop. Sub > Dub. They are only few anime that re actually good in dub which are Outlaw Star, Cowboy Bebop, Ruroni Kenshin, and etc

fVnbFLsQaa	When I was working as a lumberjack in Alberta Canada, the local native people told us of a mountain beast who looked like a huge ape and walked upright. One night in our accomodation, we heard crashing noises outside, we went to investigate and saw what we can only describe as a monster, a 'bigfoot' , the beast had smashed his way into our cabin where we washed our clothes, we chased him for a few hundred feet, but lost him in the forest. When we inspected the damage, we found only one thing missing, MY bottle of Brut 33 cologne.<br>  Every now then afterwards guys could smell the aroma of cologne in the forest but could not work out where it was coming from.......<br>  I believe in Bigfoot.|`|HxHvhZAsaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5lnavfxZWo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5lnavfxZ...</a> if thats not bigfoot, i dont know what is. its really ironic how its the typical "life on mars" scenario, but adding bigfoot legend? priceless|`|i8wie1Qjaa	No.....but my g/f does...LMAO|`|ekpg6v1Kaa	Yes i believe there is a bigfoot out there but hasn't been sighted that much.|`|lwCRXwjoaa	yes and the yeti and nessie and the chupacabra|`|CjamvYzKaa	Yes but if you should know bigfoot takes pictures of chuck norris.|`|Tck4lXx5aa	yea its a monstertruck :]|`|jHWA2RMzaa	yup! :)|`|xX3CBz1Raa	yes because<br>  jack black is his son|`|XE7ukKnDaa	Well bigfoot is a make believe thing.

656079ce94cfd53c731f9d38d09cd09baa	I love the short-sighted answer I see to this question every time it's asked...<br>  <br>  Order 66 was among a list of General Orders every Clone had trained and programmed into them.  They are to follow the general orders without question.  Order 66 is one of those situational orders that is not to be acted upon until the word is given.  This was all part of the accelerated education we see a glimpse of during Episode II.  (There's no chips in their heads or pheremonal trigger or any of the wild theories I keep seeing.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, the Clones go into the War knowing that the time may come when they must execute Order 66 and exterminate the Jedi they're working with.  That's just an order like any other.  As far as they're concerned, the Jedi are considered a potential threat to peace and the Order is in place as a failsafe if they need to ensure the safety of the Republic.  And since Clones are bred and educated to have little free-will, they aren't expected to make a judgement call on any order.<br>  <br>  They're the answer to the Droids of the Separatists.  Essentially, they're the same thing.  Since they were bred and grown, not naturally conceived and born, their lot is little more than an organic version of droids.  As such, they really only exist to serve in the Grand Army of the Republic.<br>  <br>  However, there was at least one squad of Clones who disobeyed the order.  In the book Dark Lord, a squad of Clones refuse to kill their Jedi general and he escapes the planet and survives Order 66.|`|5EtiRi2yaa	that's just the new development of it. Techinically they're clones so they're bred. And they had a secret order to kill the jedi when the order was given. Basically the clones were evil and are taken over by the Jedi (in part 2 attack of the clones) which was a plan. I mean think about it. Okay you're a superhero and find a warehouse full of inactive robots. So you think oyyy, let me use these to my advantage without thinking it through. Well that's what happened with the Jedi and there was a hidden chip that said destroy you on a certain command (order 66) that's what happened.<br>  <br>  for more info go to wikipedia "Star Wars Attack of the Clones film" for further insight. <br>  <br>  Even though George did this new set of movies, they really to me don't match the 70s. It seems being a Jedi was fun not boring and soldier like. Who'd want to do that. NOT ME haha|`|B6Z3AR3uaa	Long answer: The clones were designed in such a fashion that they would follow the orders of their commander without exception. <br>  <br>  Short answer: Because George Lucas doesn't care about continuity.

Dirty laundry and old food everywhere (me and my roommate are pigs in that respect).|`|Li9oemwqaa	just go, ugh can you smell that? or get one of yr guy mates to throw him some deodorant    =)|`|CBNC40sDaa	I think it's one of two things:    They actually are unaware of it.    They are aware of it, and just don't care.    I've tried to politely point out to the guy who sits next to me at work that his throat clearing, whistling, and belching is rude . . . but he just shrugs and keeps doing it.    Some people are just socially inept, and it makes it tougher for the rest of us.

I8LSYeD6aa	I loved Hugh when he was on Black Adder as I love British Comedy so it is kinda weird seeing him without his normal speaking voice. <br>  <br>  I really  like Laurie's acting so I deal with hearing him play another role which I feel he's good at especially in the role of Dr. House.<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard Laurie sing? He's great.|`|AA11402617	I have never seen "House" but I've heard about it and it's a testament to what a great actor he is to be able to pull it off.  I just remember him from "Jeeves and Wooster" and admired the way he could slip into or change into that character in the blink of an eye.  <br>  <br>  Anyone who is a fan of "House" should see him in that other show.  It's available on DVD from Blockbuster. It's in my que and I'm expecting volume one on Monday.|`|jYMUzFRzaa	Well most of the world doesn't know him as anything BUT House. :shrug: I think the man is a ******* genius.|`|58BL2wkjaa	if americans can't even tell he's putting on the american accent, then he's doing a damn fine job of it.<br>  do you also find it appalling when american's use "british accents"?<br>  <br>  I think most accents are hot. :D
ivg0lRUraa	It is a great classic. You'll love it...if you lilke westerns|`|qyqxp4abaa	The Mag 7 isn't just a great movie (and a good remake of a true masterpiece, the 7 Samurai) but a great casting job.  Most of the 7 went on to bigger and better things, Brynner, McQueen, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, Charles Bronson.  The odd ones out are Horst Bucholz and Brad Dexter - but Eli Wallach plays the bad guy.    Although a bigger budget, domestic flick, could almost view this as a forerunner of the spaghetti western formula that downsized the 7 to 1.    Would easily make my western top 10.|`|2pOl8PU6aa	YES.    I've ALWAYS wanted to see it.    But I KNOW it's a great movie, because of Steve McQueen.    It's a modern remake of "Seven Samurai," a Japanese movie.|`|M2II7hPNaa	its one of the best westerns ever made watch it and enjoy   you wont be disapointed|`|f99361d6fa3f57f25892e40e8f231497aa	Seven Samurai by far better. I thought this was a complete letdown.     The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  High Noon  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid    are all better films then magnificent seven|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Bah.  It is the English remake of the far superior classic Seven Samurai.  Still, it is one of the better westerns I've ever seen.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Great movie, you should check out the "the seven samurai" too.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	It's really good. Great soundtrack and Brynner, McQueen, and Bronson are great.|`|FDt7cC8haa	No, it's awesome....One of the best westerns ever made....

Some are going through something and they are trying to work their life out. So don't stereo-type people on their weight unless you know them. Don't go to the mall and call someone "fat" if you don't even know their name. It's in-human. I'm not saying that you do. But there are humans that do it. So try to fix it.<br>  <br>  And I'm so glad you know how to loose weight. Yippee for you. But some people don't have the motivation, or don't care. So just stop criticizing people and move on with your life. I do.|`|CqJ1UQWiaa	I feel indifferent. They're just like everyone else. I don't pity them.

Just like some very skinny people. That's why, i don't judge them at all.<br>  <br>  I feel like ppl are wasting their time when they sit back and make comments about oversized or undersized people. As long as it doesn't affect you, then get off their backs!

(kinda like with men, they have a center in their brain that when they see a pic of 2 men kissing, they want to violently attack, even though they would never do that, it is still hardwired in the brain).  We can control our actions, not our reaction..|`|hvdkLOT3aa	sorry but i do i am sorry but i am like fat people-afobic|`|pvosPN40aa	As someone who was fat who lost 80 pounds, I have very little sympathy or respect for people who complain and cry about how hard it is for them to lose weight.

pTERJdzQaa	For a direct downloads of full Ouran High Schol Host Club episodes go to:     http://www.anime-eden.com/|`|tVvH28GCaa	Veoh is great for downloading.|`|nMWtEmEFaa	You can find the torrent file of almost any anime, including Ouran High School Host Club. First you download a client that will download these torrents for you, I recommend Vuze (see below for download link, it was previously called Azureus). Then you have to find the torrent, I recommend IsoHunt because they don't have nasty porn ads and they will almost certainly have the anime you're looking for.    Just search the torrent Ouran High School Host Club on Isohunt, download it, and it will automatically open up in Vuze and download the anime. The more people who are downloading this anime too, the faster YOUR download will go. It'll probably be around 6 hours maybe to download 1 season.

In order to become addicted to something you must have liked it. You may come to wish you weren't addicted to it, but that doesn't mean you hate it, you still like it and you're still addicted to it.

It was this little store that sold some booze in the back and the guy always hooked me up.

nmsnZ80Haa	Yes, he died. Melinda keeps seeing and talking to him afterward.  They are at an accident scene and the guy that is hurt starts dying.  Jim goes into  his body.  Now he is the new guy with amnesia so he has no memories of his life before and no memories of Melinda.  He goes through getting to know people from his life but he is different.  He has some of Jim's characteristics.  He and Melinda end up dating.  That is where it is at right now.  It is a little confusing this year.  I don't know where they are going with it but I hope it ends up being a dream or something because I would hate to see Jim gone for good.  Hope this helps!
E2VUH8Q0aa	You don't need a Psychic; you need to talk to a career counselor. Take the Briggs Meyers test or the ASVAB and find out where your aptitude lies.<br>  <br>  *Or you could get an astrologer to look at your chart...your 10th house gives you an idea of what kind of career you'll do well at.*<br>  <br>  Midheaven in Sag indicates a career in teaching (higher education), foreign travels, and publishing.

What a disgusting coward to beat up a woman like like and shame on the poster who said "she must have done something to him" you're the reason so many abused women are afraid to come forward. There is no excuse for hitting someone, I hope his career is done and I hope he is charged and she sues him.|`|CgwEfwOZaa	Definately not.

Poor poor Rihanna. :(|`|V792ArqMaa	I would still be listening to his songs, but for his personal life, I'll just say I'm neutral. You never know Chris Brown has a side too.

cd245677e5fa5611267828a071ef7593aa	Definitely. If you'd even heard of the comics you'd know it would be worth sneaking in. <br>  It's full of superheroes, but not the ones we idealize. There are the usual elements but the superheroes aren't fantastical characters from fake cities. The Watchmen was made so that it took a set of familiar superhero archetypes, and then subverts them completely, turning them into criminals, jerks, narcissists, and wussies. impotent wussies.<br>  And instead of listening to the bad guys drone on about the facts of life and philosophical aspects of this and that, the bad guys just get their head chopped off - and that's only when our ink-splotted "hero" is crunched for time.<br>  <br>  In short, it's full of sex, violence, gore, and awesomeness.<br>  So worth it. And it's the best with a bunch friends.|`|tJf4AR5Aaa	It looks ok but it's definitely not going to be a typical superhero movie.  This might help.  <a href="http://www.film.com/features/story/watch-watchmen-not-alan-moore/17988619" rel="nofollow">http://www.film.com/features/story/watch...</a>|`|RMgJwhcsaa	Yes it looks good.  I would like to see it.  The only reason it is R is for strong graphic bloody violence and some sexual content.  There may be some language as well but it will be minor.

N1stgM5Aaa	Well "Hunter x Hunter" finished airing in 2001. However shortly afterwards there was an OVA called "Hunter x Hunter OVA" in 2002. Then in 2003 there was another OVA called "Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island" and finally in 2004 there was the last set of OVA's called "Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island Final". Since then there has been no more news on "Hunter x Hunter" except for the fact that the manga is still publishing.<br>  <br>  In short - no as of now, there is no news to continue the series.

You can make your own radio station by putting in a band name or song you like and then they give you lists of artists that you can pick and they play just that music.

Sometimes, keeping your crushes to yourself is best.|`|hd442Ha5aa	I honestly feel that they are too popular and too mainstream so I choose to not pay attention to them; in a sense I guess, my answer is no.

OH WELL|`|AlHoeGUIaa	they have no musical talent watsoever. is that a nice answer?  <br>  <br>  and you have to be willing to hear the mean comments because your in cyberspace... no one cares about your feelings. and although they may be very sweet in real life they may be inclined to be total a**holes on the web. its not personal...its jus an outlet.|`|220OzqbTaa	lol...

UX2dqQQVaa	To be honest...there is no way that this rhyme you wrote can be turned into a poem.  If you are just asking in general how to change a rhyme/rap into a poem then I can give you an answer.<br>  <br>  First, poems are supposed to be more....what's the word.....interesting.  It needs to have meaning, feeling, emotion, and a general outlook.  If you just write raps and think they can be switched, it won't happen. It is easier to turn a poem into a rhyme...you can use a beat to flow to.<br>  <br>  The other thing is to find a beat that actually fits to what you want to say.  Then you might have to say it slower or faster depending on the beat.  I would say, maybe practice some more on the rhyming and then you can work on the poetry.  While it has been said already that hip-hop is poetry from the streets...your piece here has some work that needs done.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|ahSDb7Tzaa	you have to use smaller words and get to the ryme words faster, that makes it flow, in rap you gotta make a poem and make the biggest word in each line smaller as possible keeping the beat, and thats a good trick to start but it matters how hard you work for the right words to put.|`|ymziIwN0aa	like this everyone should watch this because it is so wierd it knows something about everyone and something personal its wierd<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7yA-GpzIYE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7yA-GpzI...</a>|`|gKak1Rx7aa	if you want to rap u need a poem more fluent cuz if you try to rap that theres a hole bunch of silent stops in the middle of it|`|0sffOgJWaa	use some slang<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=11">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  please answer!<br>  we are looking for best answer!|`|MJngiGfRaa	THERE IS NO *****' WAY ***!|`|9baA8gfSaa	just add a beat|`|47Jtrk3Baa	sing it fast|`|CdCpNtFOaa	add a beat|`|doVWnwJKaa	just go with the flow , <br>  pause here & there . <br>  <br>  eg<br>  <br>  I swore to him , <br>  I would right about a girl .<br>  Someone who ( uhh )<br>  means the world <br>  etc|`|6b39147004897efba18a334c4fa4dd07aa	Basically, put an absurdly simple beat in the background and then speak to that beat.

You have to talk about things like "booty", "blow", "popin caps in dem coppers", "drive byes", "bling", "spinners", and "things that happen in da club". If you're not talking about things of that nature then your rap is destined to be sub par at best.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	I don't know.  Does it have to be rap?  To me it has a "Take a Look At My Girlfriend" (Not sure if that's he name of the song, but I like it), kind of vibe.  If you can't get the rap to work, maybe try something like that?

xwD8PUFlaa	It's quite simple really. U see Jimi Hendrix was god, and he had 2 sons, Slash & Eddie Van Halen. <br>  Therefore Slash is a son of god, and buckethead is a f*cking nobody.|`|kP0JGI1waa	I think Slash was better for GNR than Buckethead, who didnt really seem to fit in with the band.  Partially because Buckethead blows GNR and Slash out of the water! I am not even really that big of a Buckethead fan, but he is way more talented, technical, and creative than Slash and really GNR.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	LOL, buckethead most definitely.  He's all over the board when it comes to writing music.|`|GTWGVq1Vaa	ABUSE.....................SLASH CAN NOT BE COMPARED TO buckethead.......|`|f3yFRJ3maa	SLASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|llNoDDCsaa	Rocket Queen!<br>  <br>  OK fine, Suh-lash!|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Buckethead is better, but I would rather listen to Slash.|`|JqqRFFsyaa	I find it hard to bear when people say Slash is better. Just listen to Nottingham Lace. It's absurd.<br>  But Slash is indeed a better fit for GNR. But talentwise, Buckethead.|`|aS0nijbhaa	For plain out rock, Slash is by far the winner, without a doubt. But if you're into the mindless shredding fast enough to melt your face, Buckethead is the obvious choice.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Is this a trick question?<br>  <br>  <br>  Exemplars*For shure.|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	SLASH BY FAR!!!!<br>  THE "NEW GN′R" SUCK!!|`|00aaPLCjaa	i say and think bucket head

btxCFPF2aa	i think thats kind of confusing, jess, if his name is pronounced daren but spelled darien. people would think it to be pronounced like it is spelled. does that make sense? i think you should spell it darren. and then the nickname can be darry, dar, d, or maybe like his middle or last name if you dont like any of those. OR!! you could totally make up a different name that is a nickname he got from a certain situation... like i have a friend that calls me cream cheese, and another friend of mine calls me nacho-teriyaki-pants, and another that calls me selena. none of those have anything to do with my name at all, but instead with a certain situation that was memorable and they called me something random like that from then on. (i would explain, but all of those are long, confusing stories that well,are pretty embarassing, haha)<br>  <br>  hope i helped ya jessica.  good luck:D|`|7yteAuY4aa	darry!<br>  haha, i apologize if that sounds dumb to you, i just got done reading the book "the outsiders" and one of the characters' names was darry.|`|cUGjqS3Uaa	Dar <br>  Dar Dar<br>  Darry|`|FRokosDjaa	Ren!|`|muHctmaGaa	Dare.

If he plays basketball, you could call him Hoops. A player could be called Romeo. Where's he from? If he's from Texas, he could be called Dallas. What color is his hair?

VHxZuaOfaa	I like pop music insulting pop will be insulting some great like Frank Sinatra and heck even the Beatles mixed pp into there songs they were pop early in there career's also. I like rock also and pop is way better then most rap songs in pop you can't talk about slapping that hoe but in rap you can, pop is to appease the public and to have fun with. so pop is not noise it's music.<br>  <br>  good pop<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En-cHBv7UpA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En-cHBv7U...</a>|`|fn5ijdnIaa	it's for people who like to have fun at parties. I'm not into that type of thing. Me and parties don't go well and I don't dance, so...yeah.<br>  <br>  I don't like much pop music because it seems like an image is right up there next to what the music sounds like. and it's just there for you.. (i'm referring to mainstream music)<br>  and I also really really like rock bands because of the instrumental portion of it. Pop music doesn't make my ears go "OH WOW THIS IS GOOD"<br>  <br>  sorry, i'm not following your question. It's just noise for people who just like it there for background noise, I guess. People don't seem as passionate in the genre of pop.|`|e6TI1Uvmaa	I just love listening to music and songs with a good meaning and message, like some John Mayer songs, Secondhand Serenade, Lifehouse, etc. However, I don't like songs sung by 17 year old famous artists like The Jonas Brothers, Miley Cirus, you get my point. So to answer the initial question: I do love pop music when it delivers a good message about love and life, but not when it's just a joke.|`|5feIH8nGaa	i love pop music, so to me it isn't noise.<br>  for example, nsync and britney spears. i miss them.  <br>  if you ask me, pop music is sooo much better than rap. rap is noise.|`|GTWGVq1Vaa	This is the Best of Pop.....lol|`|valvULe3aa	Well, not all of it... I love rock music, but I also enjoy pop (not HM or Jonas Brother pop) , hip-hop, oldie's, Etc.|`|uKnO6t9vaa	Pop is a huge, broad genre.The Beatles and Britney Spears are entirely different, and yet they are both considered pop. There's powerpop, bubblegum pop, electropop, punk pop, pop/rock etc. <br>  <br>  Some of it is noise and some of it is infectious and/or genius. And it's all a matter of opinion.|`|wcfsaAvOaa	Pop music just stands for POPular music. It is mostly the music that is being played now and I only like about 10% that is out there. I'm more in to undiscovered bands and Rock myself.|`|ctWQFKwNaa	Hopeless, fake noise.|`|jp3WrE1caa	pop music=ew
1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	Empire of the Sun (1987)<br>  <br>  An aristocratic British youth is seperated from his family at the start of World War II after the Japanese Army invades British controlled areas of China. Reduced to living on the street and fighting for food, the youth is eventually interned in a Japanese POW camp for British civilians. Here, admiration quickly develops both for captured American pilots and the Japanese themselves. When the war ends, the boy torn from everything he knew attempts to again find his parents.<br>  .|`|HyWeOyT4aa	I'm pretty certain I have seen the movie you are referring to.

L5hvahCZaa	Perhaps because Aaron is related to Ben in some way. Perhaps Aaron is his son, or his father. Or maybe Aaron is "jacob". Yes it's a mind fug but it's a time travel thing.

H5M9WwZ5aa	the second raid is fantastic.  if you have watched the first season of full metal panic, and watched full metal panic fumoffu, you should check this out.  it ends where the first season left off as far as story goes.  the first season was a pleasant blend of action, drama, and comedy.  fumoffu was mostly comedy with a little of the rest.  the second raid is mostly action and drama, comedy takes a backseat.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	The Second Raid adds in some things left out of the first.

ItSIjxDRaa	Ok heres how it is. There are rumours ciculating around forums that Season 3 is coming out in February however there has been no official statement by GONZO that it is coming out. In fact, GONZO are going through financial difficulties and are selling different censored versions of Capu2. If they do make a third season it would be very unlikely it comes out in February if you look at the gap in time between the first and second season. They would only have had a month to do a whole season which would include writing new theme songs and allsorts. Also there has been no official trailer or advertising for it so sadly it is most likely not coming out in February. However there are rumours about a Summer airing which sounds more likely. As for now, I would watch the main company website and update yourself about GONZO's financial situation.|`|cidwIuJRaa	As far as I know,there has been no announcement at said time of *Rosario to Vampire* even having a 3rd season.|`|q89lUsnnaa	I never knew they were coming out with a new season.

Xr7NvDP8aa	Natal Chart Report<br>   <br>  What follows is your personal natal chart information, as well as interpretations of the positions and aspects in your chart.<br>  <br>  With this report, you will find out the positions of the planets in your natal chart by sign. The most personal of these are the Sun sign, Moon sign, Mercury sign, Venus sign, and Mars sign. Most people already know their Sun sign. If your time of birth is known, you will also find out your Ascendant, or rising sign, as well as the positions of the planets in the houses of your chart. Aspects between the planets are also listed and interpreted.<br>  <br>  Each paragraph of interpretation refers to an individual position in your chart. All of these positions and aspects are some of the "parts" that make up a "whole"--you! Some of these interpretations will be contradictory, just as people are contradictory. A person can be downright timid in love, and that same person can be aggressive in business. Not only that, we evolve and grow throughout our lives, facing challenges that help us to handle our positions and aspects in a different way. We all have choices, and one of the largest benefits of astrology is the ability to understand ourselves better so that we can work with our natal charts rather than against them. Any computerized report that interprets the individual placements in a natal chart is somewhat disjointed, simply because the different parts that make up the whole are not synthesized.<br>  <br>  Some of the interpretations that follow are detailed, while others are brief. You can do some further reading about different positions (such as Moon in Libra, Saturn in the 10th house, Moon conjunct Mercury) in your chart by exploring our own site, other astrology sites, and by reading astrology books.<br>  <br>  The tables here show the technical details of your natal chart, personalized based on your birth data.

On the right, you will find the sign of your Ascendant and the signs on the cusp of each house in your natal chart. The Roman Numerals refer to the houses, where the Ascendant is also the first house and the Midheaven is also the tenth house. For example, if the sign Taurus is next to Mars, you know your Mars is in Taurus. If the sign Libra is next to Venus, you know your Venus is in Libra. If Cancer is next to Ascendant, you have a Cancer Ascendant, and if Leo is next to II, Leo is on your 2nd house.<br>  <br>  <br>  Zodiac in degrees 0.00   Placidus Orb:0<br>  Sun Aquarius 27.17   Ascendant Virgo 21.38<br>  Moon Capricorn 13.10   II Libra 16.58<br>  Mercury Aquarius 24.41   III Scorpio 16.55<br>  Venus Aries 11.27   IV Sagittarius 20.18<br>  Mars Aries 9.59   V Capricorn 24.02<br>  Jupiter Aquarius 2.08   VI Aquarius 24.52<br>  Saturn Scorpio 27.48   VII Pisces 21.38<br>  Uranus Sagittarius 17.27   VIII Aries 16.58<br>  Neptune Capricorn 3.00   IX Taurus 16.55<br>  Pluto Scorpio 4.43 R   Midheaven Gemini 20.18<br>  Lilith Aries 18.09   XI Cancer 24.02<br>  Asc node Taurus 22.33   XII Leo 24.52<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Aspects<br>  <br>  The following table shows the planetary aspects in your natal chart.

AA11784502	Hello ,   Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo ;  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gankutsuou  Genres: adventure, drama, mystery, romance, science fiction, thriller   Themes: Deception, Mecha, Revenge   Age rating: Mature (May contain sex, drugs, and extreme graphic violence)   Plot Summary: Trying to escape his uneventful life, Albert, the son of a renowned general from Paris, makes a journey with his friend Franz. During his travels, he meets an immensely wealthy nobleman named The Count of Monte Cristo. Living in luxurious hotels, surrounded by beautiful women and strong bodyguards, the charming but enigmatic count fascinates Albert. Albert invites the count to join the high society of Paris. However, unknown to Albert, his father had once framed the count and took the Count's fiancee as his own.   "It's impossible to discuss Gankutsuou without making a huge deal out of the visuals, which are breathtaking to behold. Mahiro Maeda, the show's director, is a fantastic artist and has a remarkable background in fine art, and his penchant for flashy but dignified visuals shines in Gankutsuou more than any of his previous projects. Clothing is rendered as a basic outline of the garment that moves over a static fabric background; hair is done in the same fashion, as are many other textures and surfaces in the show. The result will either make you weep tears of joy at how marvelously unique and beautiful it is or it'll make you sort of nauseous and dizzy and maybe your eyes will hurt a little. I found myself firmly in the former camp; what Maeda has created is an absolute feast for the eyes. Fans of art nouveau pioneers like Gustav Klimt will love what they see here."  Or,  Cowboy BeBop ;  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  "Genres: action, drama, science fiction   Age rating: Mature (May contain sex, drugs, and extreme graphic violence)   Plot Summary: Spike Spiegel, a bounty Hunter with a dark past, lives on bounty to bounty, barely making it each time, or not making it at all. His partners Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Ed and Ein the dog all help him in his adventures from planet to planet. "  Cowboy BeBop the movie ;  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  "Genres: action, drama, science fiction   Age rating: Teenagers (May contain bloody violence, bad language, nudity)   Plot Summary: As the Cowboy Bebop crew travels the stars, they learn of the largest bounty yet, a huge 300 million oolongs. Apparently, someone is wielding a hugely powerful chemical weapon, and of course the authorities are at a loss to stop it. The war to take down the most dangerous criminal yet forces the crew to face a true madman, with bare hope to succeed.

They get amazing reviews from the "Judges" who really don't have the qualifications. Shane Sparks is a choreographer alright that makes sense. JC was in NSYNC where granted he did choreography, but he wasn't writing it himself. Lil Mama may call herself a "Hip Hop Diva" but let's not forget one of her most popular songs was a remix of an Avril Lavigne song. But I digress.. I'm pretty sure only one girl "Shorty" can actually do any b-girl moves and the only thing she can do well is a headspin and flares. They repeat the same basic technique and bring nothing original to the table. Quest Crew is original and they pull off ridiculous stunts.|`|vnGgtkWUaa	beat freaks are good but i prefer quest because they are more entertaining; beat freaks repeat routines sometimes like the head spin from week 4 & 6. <br>  <br>  + i think beat freaks would only win if the show was RIGGED, being that guy dance crews won the title in the last two seasons, so this would make them the first girl dance crew to win.|`|LB3meZSfaa	I honestly don't know :[<br>  I use to be Quest Crew all the way.. & didn't like Beat Freakz AT ALL!<br>  but now I love Quest Crew & I'm really starting to like Beat Freakz.<br>  HONESTLY, Quest Crew is better & consistent.<br>  But think about it; no female crew has won yet so they might just rig it because people will be upset if 3 male crews win in a row.<br>  Don't get me wrong Beat Freakz doesn't need sympathy, they work for theirs' but they do have to think about the audience you know.<br>  So chances are Beat Freakz will win.<br>  Even though Quest Crew has more potential.<br>  <br>  I WANT Quest Crew to win though . lol :]|`|AWnW8L7Taa	Are you insane yes beat freaks are really good and their week 6 was incredible but quest crew just owned it week 6 and also beat freaks copyrighted the jabbawockezz week 6 with the spin|`|1iOVlntaaa	beat freaks!
Z15TM1VQaa	Ayashi no Ceres (romantic & action)<br>  There is a legend of an angel who fell to Earth many years ago, and was forced to marry a man because he held the key to her only way home. Hundreds of years later, sixteen year old Mikage Aya is the reincarnation of Ceres, the vengeful angel, who must now fight for her life against her family and her own twin brother Aki, the reincarnation of her past evil husband...<br>  <br>  Winx Club (Action & Romantic)<br>  Bloom is an average teenage Earth girl going into high school or that’s what she thinks until she meets princess Stella of the planet Solaria. Stella just happened to be in trouble at the time when Bloom had first meet her, but after Stella tells her what was happening Stella ends up telling Bloom that she is a pixie, and a powerful one too. So Stella takes Bloom to a high school for pixies & Bloom starts to live in a world she would only be dreaming about if she hadn't met Stella, but that’s just the beginning.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tokyo Mew Mew (Action & romantic)<br>  On her first date with the cutest boy in school, Ichigo is zapped by a mysterious ray that scrambles her DNA with that of the endangered Iriomote wildcat. The next day, Ichigo discovers that she has developed the agility (and occasionally the ears and tail) of a cat, as well as the power to transform into a pink-haired superheroine, Mew Ichigo. She & four other girls, each endowed with the genes of a different “Red Data” animal, have been selected for the top-secret Mew Project, which aims to protect the Earth from an alien menace known as Deep Blue.<br>  <br>  Zoids Chaotic Century (Action & a slow romance)<br>  Van always wanted a zoid of his own & always goes out to some old ruins near his vilage. One day he was being chased by some bandits on his way to the ruins. He had goten stuck in the ruins so he decided to go and look around in them, thats where he had found an orginoid, that gave him his own zoid, & a zoidian (Feona) that didn't remember anything from her past. So Van decided to help her & left the village with thoes two following him. Thats were their story begins.<br>  &<br>  Zoids Guardian Force (the sequal but it also adds a bit more romance)<br>  Van & Feona havn't found much things out about Feona's past but they have gained a good reputation. This time they are deffenatly going to find out what happend in Feona's past.<br>  <br>  Flame of Recca (Action & Romantic)<br>  Becoming a ninja is just a childhood dream for sixteen-year-old Recca, until a fateful encounter reveals he has inherited ninja powers, including the ability to wield fire! As Recca learns to master the ancient ways of his ancestors, he is drawn to protect his "Hime," she is a mysterious girl named Yanagi. When Koran Mori challenges him for her life, he must enter a tournament to protect her, and defeat Mori along with all of Mori's subordinates.<br>  <br>  Fruits Basket (Comedy & Romance)<br>  About a young high school girl named Tohru who begins living under the same roof as the most popular person in the hole school, Yuki Sohma.  Tohru finds out that certain members of the Sohma family have a curse on them, when hugged by members of the opposite sex, they turn into animals from the zodiac. Since Tohru is a girl living with three of the zodiac guys, she sometimes turns them into animals (obviously). There's a lot of things in this that would make you laugh so much you wouldn’t be able to breath.<br>  <br>  Yu Yu Hakusho (Romantic & action)<br>  Yusuke Urameshi is a street fighter with a tough guy approach to everything, but no one ever expected a sudden act of heroism on his part: dieing, from trying to save a little boy from a speeding car. When he arrived in the afterlife, he is informed that no one was expecting him to die that way, & were not prepared for his arrival. Yusuke is eventually revived, & is assigned to work for the Spirit Realm as a Spirit Detective in the human world. No one knows what this idiot will do but most times, it seems like he ends up winning just by a little luck (or a cheap shot).<br>  <br>  Dragon Ball (Action & comedy)<br>  This is about a young boy named Goku meeting people, finding out what Dragon balls are, looking for the Dragon Balls, & a lot of other things that happen in Goku's life. Goku is really funny he thinks that anything you say is (or can be) related to either food or fighting. If you watch the anime you might like Dragon Ball Z whitch is just about the same thing, but if you watch Dragon Ball GT you would most likly not like it.<br>  <br>  Ouran High School Host Club (Romance & comedy)<br>  Haruhi, a scholarship student at exclusive Ouran High School (a school full of rich kids), breaks an $80,000 vase that belongs to the "Host Club", a mysterious school club consisting of six super-rich (and gorgeous) guys.

ViEgekyIaa	I went there when I was in high school. I'm not a model or actress now, but I did learn some pretty cool stuff. (makeup, walking down runway, mannequin, eye contact, etc)<br>  <br>  For the most part, after you graduate the program (I didn't) you get to have an agent. They book you interviews for commercials and little things. My teachers mostly did mannequin gigs. The girls you see at the mall who sign people up are the main graduates though. They do not get paid much, but that's what most of them do; go to places to recruit students for the program. <br>  <br>  If you are serious about acting and you're in school then take theatre. If not then I'd recommend to you a good acting school. JC is more about runway and payments than acting. Not much time is spent on acting or improv (and that turned out to be my fav part).<br>  <br>  I don't know if my link will help you, but good luck!|`|uvRja8tMaa	if they ask for money in advance, they're not
pTERJdzQaa	The eng.dubbed episodes of Naruto will be available online when the the eng dubbed Naruto Shippuden premiers on TV.<br>  <br>  Im really pissed off at Cartoon Network because they were suppose to start airing the damn episodes like 10 years ago[im exaggerating out of rage] but seriously Cartoon Network is slaking on Naruto episodes and they show Superman and Batman movies over the time there supposed to play Naruto, and Im just thinking WTF!!!

ul9qxw4Uaa	try Kino no Tabi or it called Kino's Journey. There alot of thing about it just watch and ep and you know and it not bad either. <br>  In Kino's Journey, the protagonist, Kino, accompanied by a talking motorcycle, a Brough Superior motorcycle named Hermes, travels through a mystical world of many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. Kino only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place, while leaving time to explore new lands. Kino says in The Land of Visible Pain that this principle is probably a lie, specifically noting "if I stay any longer, I'm afraid I will settle down." A phrase repeated in the anime and novels is "The world is not beautiful, therefore it is." Kino's Journey explores what the anime director Ryutaro Nakamura described as "a radical sense of 'beauty,"[2] and brutality, loneliness, nonsense, oppression and tragedy are often juxtaposed against compassion and a fairy-tale atmosphere.<br>  <br>  For protection and hunting, Kino carries a .44 single action revolver (called "the Cannon", based on a Colt M1851) that uses liquid explosives in place of gunpowder and a .22 automatic pistol (named "the Woodsman", based on a Colt Woodsman). Later in Kino's adventures in the novels, Kino also uses a semi-automatic sniper rifle (called "the Flute") along with a variety of other tools, including knives. In the anime, she is shown to carry no less than five knives on her person, including one which can fire bullets from its hilt. Kino is an unusually quick draw and practices every day before dawn.<br>  <br>  Technology in this world exists, sometimes to the level of science fiction, although anachronisms are common (for example, the same land that has talking robots also appears to have phonographs, yet simultaneously the world has not developed heavier-than-air flight). The level of technology also varies from country to country. The world is not heavily magical (the only "magical" elements include land that moves, a talking motorcycle, and a talking dog), although it has a certain fairy-tale quality.|`|l9uGrfSYaa	Bo x7.............e.e <br>  <br>  HA JUST KIDDING! <br>  <br>  Anyways, I think all Miyazaki movies in general do. Why? Because they all (and I mean all) have a message that miyazaki strategically put in there for people to subconciously found. Most of these messages are ideal meanings that not most would accept in society (but they are ideal, not what he thinks should be). You can tell what phase he was going through by the style his movies are in, therefore, those have the deepest meaning because I have seen so many messages displayed thoughout that series of movies. <br>  <br>  nya|`|IGu36Iwwaa	Sorry everyone is posting the most superficial animes produced so far(minus Grave of the Fireflies), well here we go<br>  <br>  9 Centimeters per Second<br>  Voices of a Distant Star<br>  Perfect Blue(Adults only)<br>  Jin-Roh<br>  Ghost in the Shell(Films not TV series)<br>  The Place Promised in Our Early Days<br>  <br>  These may take a few watchings and some knowledge of Japanese culture to fully understand, and some will seriously mess with your head or depress you horribly.|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	I didnt' watch gintama anime but when i read the manga it had deepest meaning in it. so i guess in anime too they will have deep meaning in it. <br>  <br>  then you have xxxholic anime which has deep meaning in it.|`|Kwzl0qOraa	Amatsuki<br>  but I dont really understand the ending.

It is also popular and well-animated, so it is easy to watch, too.<br>  <br>  Elfin Lied also deals with social alienation, animal abuse, insanity, and many other difficult themes, but I believe that the themes are ~somewhat~ masked by the graphic violence and ecchi.  <br>  <br>  Nana eventually deals with parental rejection, prostitution, suicide, unplanned pregnancy, love, gender rolls, loss and many other deep themes, but it is also somewhat lightened by joking animation at ~times.<br>  <br>  Paradise Kiss is similar to Nana but also questions gender identity.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! ~star~|`|LSd5TkUxaa	Anything from Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies, etc).

FKaoaD2yaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather#Cinematic_influence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfath...</a> : <br>  Although many films about gangsters had been made prior to The Godfather, Coppola's sympathetic treatment of the Corleone family and their associates, and his portrayal of mobsters as characters of considerable psychological depth and complexity was hardly usual in the genre. This was even more the case with The Godfather Part II, and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, opened the doors for more and varied depictions of mobster life, including films such as Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" and TV series such as David Chase's "The Sopranos".<br>  <br>  <br>  I would say, everyone thinks God Father was the best probably coz it was the first of the kind. It was the first attempt to give a different flavor of Don movies, and of course, was very rich in plot and entertainment factors.<br>  <br>  For me, this movies is like #1 ever !!|`|IARPr7k5aa	but the thing is, the godfather can't be like the sopranos, it's the other way around, that's the way you have to look at it. they didn't copy the sopranos, the sopranos copied them. you should also see the second one too. the first one will make more sense. honestly my fave mob movie ever was Casino with robert deniro, based on a true story.|`|YUjVFkocaa	To me, it had me riveted and i was never bored of it the whole time, even though it wasnt an action movie.<br>  <br>  but thats just me. idk

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Everyone's powers returned after the eclipse, and Mohinder got his scales and other side effects back.  He also mutated further and had problems breathing.  But when he tried to stop Peter, he got doused in the new formula, which apparently left him with his strength but eliminated the side effects (at least visible ones, and at least for now).<br>  <br>  On the Ando front, I'd think it depends upon how powers work, which they've been very fuzzy on.  If Hiro's powers were completely eliminated then charging him wouldn't do anything.  It;a also possible that Arthur caused some damage, and charging him would be like trying to charge a cracked battery - they tend to explode.|`|1hS27eJuaa	every ones powers returned after the eclipse including monhinders along with the side effects, when primetect was being destroyed someone of the completed formula to give powers land on him, removing the side effects.

35ZtTBFqaa	that happens...there is nothing to feat but fear it self<br>  well that what i tell myself..tob|`|jjMvvJrmaa	Your just a little paranoid by the movie. dont worry, it happend to me when i was younger. Just turn up the music real loud so you cant hear the stuff. or go to bed. or go to the naughbors and explain the situation to them and ask if you can stay untill your parents get home..|`|hFVPEkWjaa	well this is stupid but i go outside and stand up till the come home lol|`|GdvzZRFMaa	If you know the noises are in your imagination ignore them. Put a fun movie or show on the TV, play up beat music or call a friend. Try not to watch scary movies|`|v1tHjJ3haa	hide under ur covers with all the lights in the house on and listen to JB, that's what I'd do :D|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Now, its all in your head because of the horror movie...Turn on the TV and watch your favorite comedy show or movie...That will get your mind off it...|`|YW1DXceqaa	how about a bear hug? =]<br>  <br>  ..or watch something to drown out the noise..listen to music with headphones while doing Y!A|`|cp7fjeJhaa	hi there, i hate that, just realize that you are paranoid now after watching the movie, go around the house and make sure all the doors/windows are locked (bring your phone with you so you feel safe) put the tv on or music on, and just keep your phone with you, stay on the boards and answer questions, to keep your mind off it.  you can always call the front desk at your local police and tell them you are home alone and a bit scared and ask if you they drive by a few extra times too, they shouldn't mind, I have done it.   If you are spiritual/religious, picture God/Jesus/Angels surrounding you and protecting you.|`|fQ1qDMaqaa	Turn on all the lights, lock the doors, turn on some of your favorite music or turn on the Television to distract you from the scary sounds. Even try calling your friend for comfort, or just someone to talk to. Snuggle with a pet if you have one. Even try checking out where the sounds are coming from, this may sound stupid but when you found out that that scary sound sis really just the furnace, you'll feel a lot better. So just keep a phone near by to have easy acess to call a friend of family member.<br>  <br>  Hoppe this helps. :)|`|BTkHkkJTaa	just stay on the computer.  that usually helps a lot.  your mind is playing tricks on you, ignore it.|`|e21892de222e33771277e1428b0b9c41aa	Crank up that iPod, sistaah. (:|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Lock your doors, now! <br>  <br>  <br>  hah what movie was it? I could probably relate! I get paranoid all the time, especially when home alone or alone all together. <br>  <br>  Whatever the movie was, it's fake. lol dont worry, your on Y!A now. its all better|`|VjaQZhReaa	try to see if one of your friends can come over.<br>  also:<br>  lock the doors.<br>  listen to your ipod or somthing with head phones and get distracted by the sounds,<br>  <br>  also if you have any animals put one next to you|`|7gpAdJGaaa	YOU CAN E- ME BACK IF YOU WANT WE CAN GET UN FREAKED|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	text ur friends while ure watching a movie. texting will make it feel like ur not alone, and the movie will keep you distracted. and get a dog. i always let my dog in when i'm home alone, cuz i mean im the same way. just watching the dark knight got me paranoid, even though i love that movie. if you really don't wanna feel alone, get a webcam or something. get ur friends to come over while ur parents r working.<br>  And when i'm feelin like that i don't turn on music cuz then i keep turnin it off cuz i think i hear somethin, so i play the computer instead. with my mind on the computer its like i don't hear it. <br>  My dog makes me feel better every time bc one nite she was sleepin on the floor next to my bed, and i was asleep. the hall light was off, and my dad was walkin down the hall. my dog saw him and didn't recognize him and started growling. it makes me feel good bc i know she knows if somethings there. like sometimes when we come home from school, we'll walk up to the door and realize its been wide open all day, and we always send the dog in first to make sure no ones in there and i'm never even nervous going back in if my dogs with me. get a good dog if u dont have one already. even if its not that good of a watchdog, it'll atleast make u feel safe.|`|VitgbxXJaa	Its All Good , Im Home Alone All The Time And I "think" I Hear Things Too But Nuthin Ever Happens , So Dont Trip Crip !|`|WNRcUHjfaa	Well the first thing if scary movies freak you out you shouldn't watch them. Second thing you should call a friend to see if they would come spend the night and keep you company but call your parents to make sure it is all right for someone to spend the night so your parents won't get upset with you.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	it really helps to turn all the lights on, and watch a comedy, just change the mood so you don't think of these things|`|C1fBdw95aa	Not watch horror movies.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	ignore them and put some music on... your just being paranoid ... happens to me all the time|`|ITiuIb1Waa	watch a comedy,anytime your a bit scared think about the comedy and bam,your on smily happy street again|`|28Xsi7Paaa	Talk to me I'm bored hehe|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Do you have any neighbors or friends you can go to of have someone come keep you company?|`|ROWSzTknaa	Make Jiffy Pop,  Put on something tight, fall asleep waiting for your friend to come over, Answer the Phone. <br>  No, seriously no more scary movies! Make sure the doors are locked and call your Mom.|`|gUdFFYNTaa	Just watch some t.v. for a distraction.. make sure all the doors are locked, and turn on some lights~|`|d71203d118a10dbd920ebc4a3ac6942caa	go to sleep with headphones playing music and lights on|`|J0G4lRrNaa	It's all in your mind.<br>  I've done the same thing when I saw a horror movie. XD<br>  Don't watch them anymore, and try to watch something more cheerful.|`|uZTzird4aa	just blast music, to drown out the sound and dance hahah|`|GZVqEEDraa	Omg!  Now I'm going to be hearing things!  Dammit!  It's to late to call anyone where I am at.<br>  <br>  If it's not to late, call a friend and randomly jabber about nothing until your parents get home.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Stack classes in front of all the door so when the monster come in he will knock the glasses over and you'll hear them|`|JMQKjPLuaa	i get REALLY freaked out from horror movies too... just stop watching them, think of some thing you are not afraid of ... and just get your mind off of the movie|`|lqSzyw07aa	You should turn on the TV so you have noise in the house with you, and try to absorb yourself in something that will take your full attention so you're not thinking about the fact that you're alone. Like doing homework or reading or watching whatever you put on TV. Also, try to remember it IS just a movie and it is all FAKE, and they're all actors (sometimes not very good, I mean really, did they really have to scream like THAT?|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	I carry a bat in my room, along with a knife, makes me feel better when I'm scared. Lol hope this helped.|`|9dCFYwb5aa	1. You shouldnt have watched the movie lol<br>  2. Get your mind distracted, watch tv, call a friend, etc.<br>  3.honestly, call your parents if your really that scared..they should calm you down.<br>  4. i dont know what movie it was but if it had something to do with kidnapping n stuff, an alarm always made me feel safe.<br>  5.talk to your parents about it. maybe there are changes you could make.<br>  6. those "voices" are because your paranoid, theres no1 in your house besides you lol<br>  <br>  Hope this helped a little bit<br>  good luck|`|IDC7BijGaa	you're just having jitters from watching that scary movie. Just watch a comedy, that helos me.|`|Th0Znuf7aa	Well, i think its just the affect of the movie so just go over a friends house or have them come over until this thing about you being scared goes away, thats what i do too. lol, and another piece of advice, dont watch too many scary movies, i know i shouldnt. hope i helped :) oh and leave all the lights on, that helped me.|`|QbIwSONDaa	Ehh yes coz im a 10 yr old i had to stay home alone at night once. My 13 yr old sister wos there but she is really immature. Mum said not to go onto her laptop. She wouldnt tell me to go to bed or anything.<br>  <br>  The fact is that what i did I stood up for myself tryed to be brave.<br>  <br>  With your problem i guess you are just being scared. Movies are movies, some based on real life stories but you cant change the past can you? If its not based on a true story then you have to stop worrieing. Just because you see something on a movie doesnt mean it will happen irl.|`|sTKJkvFsaa	Whatever you're doing, put the TV on. Doing your HW, on the computor, blast the TV, It works for me :)|`|4NOSvnHHaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya93JWrdxFc&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya93JWrdx...</a><br>  <br>  There is nothing to be scared of my friend. A movie is a movie, and what didn't happen before won't happen just because you watched a movie. Besides, night is a time of wonder and amazment. A time when we get to see all of natures beauty and the hand of God in the skies to their fullest. Smile, you'll be fine... just as you have always been fine :)|`|twHXC9Draa	oh my gosh that movie is really funny i think its all a bunch of really bad actors and some guy with i huge tumor!!!!!!!!! hehe come on and  just laugh youll get over it you are safe now absorb yourself in the way we all internet and y,a surfing well actually i dont but you know what !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... ^_^i mean<br>  booooooooooo!!!!! lol hehe just kiddinQ1 hope i helped|`|ByCWXzCuaa	lol your just paranoid. close your door and turn the lights on. peek your head out to prove that theres nothing to be afraid of. and if it makes your feel better, hold a stuffed animal or call your friend or text your friends.<br>  Staying connected with friends makes me feel safe becauase then if something happens they will realize and come rescue me :D|`|SFUM3Jgvaa	Suck it up|`|W8hk5DENaa	It's nothing.<br>  Just your imagination.<br>  Do something to distract you.<br>  Something that involves noise.<br>  Watch happy movies.<br>  Call one of your friends.<br>  Listen to music.<br>  Or you could just go to sleep.<br>  <br>  But whatever you do, DO NOT GO OUTSIDE TO INVESTIGATE.<br>  Have a nice night [:|`|DxyyWahdaa	have some friends over and try to avoid the noise|`|MOLIehyTaa	when im scared i get my dog close by, in your case cats, and put on the t.v. or listen to my ipod and turn on a bunch of lights|`|Uv6fADcaaa	Being alone, is the reason I have a dog.<br>  <br>  Just keep a light on and lock the doors.

767fd71f931856f7e4e2fe8bf027c74caa	Playing in a soccer game and then randomly stopping to ask the referee how old he was.|`|v0FlUan0aa	at day care, i saw this little kid use my tissues which were in my pocket.  and he was wearing my coat for some odd reason. haha its a long story..  i was wearing some horse coat.. anyways the next day i told my dad o put my barney coat in the bucket so no one would use my tissues again.. HAHAHA :]]
LS6zgscQaa	i thought it was great, very entertainging. disturbing though, the acting was great, there were some funny parts. It is wayyyy worth watching!<br>  go see it. be prepared for some really bad nude scenes though. i like how the plot was made, the plot was about finding his sister ......im not saying the rest.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	I thought it was cool!<br>  I liked it!<br>  I thought it could of been a little better though!<br>  <br>  Yea, it's a decent horror flick!<br>  <br>  Yes, there Remaking A Nightmare On Elm Street! It comes out in 2010! I can't wait!|`|AA10796997	I love horror movies - even campy b horror movies like Tremors or night of the creeps etc . As far as this one goes the way i see it is if you are going to remake a classic movie like Friday the 13th then you need to take the direction Rob Zombie took when he redid halloween . Add another angle to it , watching jason grow up would have been cool , maybe his mother was a psycho all his life , maybe she was a great god fearing woman and his drowning sent her over the edge etc etc - Well they did none of this , it might as well have been Friday the 13th part .. whatever its up to now - kids having sex , getting killed , same ol same ol - there was so many other options to explore - what a letdown . For a slasher flick it was what it was - if your a fan of horror movies this one was fair but really really a dissapointment|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	friday the 13 was good. its a good horror flick if you haven't seen any jason movies, but if you a fan it's the same gore and plot. nothing new. and yes they are making a nightmare on elm st. they just got a director and they are working on the script.|`|z6qIZRFFaa	Its wasn't scary at all, i went to see it, and i will not be watching it again...lol There was too much nudity it was just plain awkward<br>  <br>  Oh and it sucked|`|29132974a862c9fc817fd555a52845f5aa	It was okay, not as good as I thought it would be.|`|6yZuB1wBaa	i had high expectations.<br>  it was mediocre.<br>  <br>  they're supposedly rebooting the nightmare on elm street franchise.|`|iQN5KGaTaa	IT WAS GOOD BIT DISTURBING...IT WAS WORTH WATCHIG|`|RcBkUBsfaa	i saw the beggining maybe like 30 min and it seemed boring..just like any other jason movie so i took it off

6vzpHTqQaa	I hope so.<br>  <br>  They looked great together in the last episode when they had to go undercover in a suburban neighborhood posing as husband and wife.  They did it so naturally and, if the neighbors hadn't been Fulcrum agents, no one would have been able to tell that Charles Carmichael and Sarah Walker weren't really married.<br>  <br>  I believe she'll quit the CIA to be with Chuck.<br>  <br>  Short answer: Yes.  They make a great couple, and it would be a disappointment if the show were to run its course without those two ending up together.|`|WFzt2fHOaa	I hope so! I'm addicted to that show!|`|xYgQ6TSOaa	One of my favorite shows-it's so great having them pining over each other though, like this last one with them in the suburbs undercover as a married couple--very adorable! So yep I'm with ya-I want them to hook up and be together but then again I'm scared for the elements of the show aka Scrubs with JD and Elliot, it's fun seeing them on their "journey" to being together but lets hope once they are, it doesn't take anything away from the shows fantastic writing!! <br>  A nice twist-have them just up and leave for a weekend, secretly just get married, come back, and just not tell anyone or wear rings-have it be their little secret ; )|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	I think that getting a couple together has ruined pretty much every show I ever enjoyed.  And I go back to shows in the 70's like Moonlighting and Scarecrow and Mrs. King.  What makes it work is that they're kept apart but want each other.  I like "House, M.D." for this reason -- they kept Cuddy and House battling, not together.<br>  <br>  I just started watching Chuck and I love this show.  You know, maybe they could do a dream sequence where they just imagine being together?|`|HEs6bzOtaa	I sure hope so, chuck is awesome<br>  absolutely the best<br>  i think in about 10-20 episodes they will be together<br>  <br>  Anyway anyone here a kyle xy fan because if you are<br>  Please go to www.savekylexy.com and press save kyle xy<br>  If you can sign a petition it might not get cancelled <br>  Please help|`|A571PHYtaa	I love it too, and I think they'll do it, maybe around 4th season or something, when they are tired of dragging it out for so long, but god, i want them to be together so bad!!!|`|41U6UBu5aa	yeah, eventually they kind of have to, probably not until at least the end of the season though.

She went over the cliff, but in soap land, that's nothing. Remember! She also wanted a baby for Zach.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	yea i totally agree with you, Reese keeps saying how much she loves bianca but she's not proving it cause her actions say other wise.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I think she is confused.

LYc0LfvAaa	Yes they are! :) The Strokes are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BAND IN THE WORLD! I know ALL of their songs.<br>  Yes, it's true! On their website they wrote that they are set together on working on their album in early February. Albert has stated in interviews that they are supposed to meet Feb. 11 at 2:00PM in a studio. <br>  <br>  "Julian has started writing and Nick has got some material as well," he said.

We're still in February. Most likely it'll be released in early 2010 or HOPEFULLY late 09'. <br>  <br>  If you're just dieing to listen to Julian Casablancas' voice then listen to the song "Boombox" FEAT.

ImQmxqWHaa	Yeah your pretty and kinda tall, i would do it if i were you. But i remember watching a True Hollywood story of Americas Next Top Model, and Tyra was saying yeah the women are pretty but there were much prettier girls who didn't make it because they had no personality, and you can't have people on TV with no personality. So i would make sure you show some personality and admiration. Good Luck|`|hnNi8YsPaa	you should. <br>  got nothing to lose.|`|EPmuhhGaaa	It depends on how muchtaller than five foot 7 you are.<br>  <br>  hoping not much because this new season is AT OR UNDER 5 foot 7 to mix it up.<br>  <br>  if not much go for it- if a lot, like almost 5'8 you can but they may not take ur height. then audition next cycle too when the heights back to normal|`|r4CtEqwLaa	I think u should have a try...ur look is quite unique..<br>  and must always be confident on urself.. <br>  Dont too boader about u will be stand out from the rest or not, just believe ur self because at the end, the result is always out of our expectation..<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|lIUA6Q2Caa	you got everything you can|`|A571PHYtaa	You never know until you try.

Pick a band you like then go to lastfm.com and search for the band and look at the list of similar artists.  This site is always good for picking similar sounding bands.

I mailed Christopher Paloni and got an autographed photo. I mailed Selena Gomez and got 2 autographed photos( sent one photo). I mailed BARACK OBAMA and got an preprint autograph( this was from 2007, before presidency). You are more likely to get a reply if you use larger envelopes.  I have learned smaller envelopes are easy for people to lose|`|219467a6a6cd9560f6a090b03ea6875faa	yes. i wrote to lindsay wagoner last year, about a trajic incident in1978, that she got involved with, providing help to the victim in the incident. she was surprised at the way i remembered the story, so closely, from the news accounts at the time. i told her i used to work at universal studio, around the time she was doing the bionic woman, in the late 70's, and remembered being introduced to her. she thanked me for remembering her so well, after so many years and wished me well  i told her it was easy to remember some one i was takiing "closeups" with, when i was behind the camera shooting her daily, for the series.. lindsay was, and still is a lovely lady...|`|1UypVpgYaa	yea i mailed selena gomez and nick jonas <br>  i sent hey selena then she replied i'm sorry i couldn't reply cuz i was very busy<br>  and i sent 2 nick jonas i love ur music ur style .... etc<br>  and he said haha cool
HqcH85SMaa	Ashton Shepherd is the best female singer I've heard in a while.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Here's one that hasn't been said yet:  Katrina Elam.  Her voice is one of the best female voices I've ever heard and she's a great songwriter.  To hear the only released song that truly showcased Elam's voice AND songwriting abilities, look up "Love Is," which would have been on her second album.  Sadly though, Universal South Records decided to not release the album and, in 2008, dropped Elam from the label altogether.  I'd consider that modern country's BIGGEST loss.  Of course, you can hear newer music of Elam's at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/katrinaelam" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/katrinaelam</a><br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd recommend looking up the music video for "Love Is" on YouTube.  That song is the best example of how BIG Katrina Elam's voice really is.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE:  Before Carrie Underwood ever recorded "Flat on the Floor," Katrina Elam recorded a version, which was somehow leaked onto YouTube, even though it was unreleased.  Honestly, Elam could outsing and outwrite some of the most well-known female "country" artists today, including Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift and just about anyone else!  Oh, and to add to my answer--whoever said that Ashton Shepherd is the best female country vocalist right now is correct.  Of course, I wouldn't be saying that if Katrina Elam was a signed artist...anyway, check Elam and Shepherd out--you won't be sorry if you appreciate true talent!|`|2qj9wCR1aa	Carrie Underwood and Kellie Pickler are great!<br>  <br>  I think you should listen to this Kellie Pickler song, it's very sweet-<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzyV1hm0c18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzyV1hm0c...</a>|`|MuPxWmJhaa	Taylor Swift<br>  Carrie Underwood<br>  Kelly Pickler<br>  Jessica Simpson<br>  Julliane Hough<br>  ;]|`|wYNtfiTMaa	Carrie underwood : )|`|HrDcaocMaa	LeAnn Rimes|`|A571PHYtaa	I'm a fan of Carrie Underwood, she's in the same general pool as Taylor Swift|`|p1bDWCUGaa	Lee Ann Womack <br>  miranda lambert <br>  LeAnn Rimes|`|dmh1so38aa	carrie underwood, Kelie Pickler, and Miranda Lambert . :)

You could probably change thier ming if it's the former... they're in highschool, so can be more easily swayed when it comes to guys.|`|ba0f099392c4e5f361bd0e050604ae62aa	Yes, I would say so.<br>  I mean they just do it because they might want to get your attention.
