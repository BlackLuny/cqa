02217d0e7d25f290ffa319e130d7b364aa	and the rest of your answer..<br>  <br>  s Soy<br>  What Is Soy Milk?<br>  <br>  Delicious, convenient and incredibly good for you, soy milk may well become your favorite drink. Made from soy beans (no cows involved), soy milk is often used in place of dairy milk as a refreshing drink, over breakfast cereal and in coffee. For cooking, soy milk lends a boost of creamy great taste and extra nutrition to baked goods, casseroles and more. Plus, soy milk is the secret ingredient in the world’s greatest smoothies!<br>  <br>  Soy milk has long been a popular choice for people who are lactose intolerant or prefer to avoid animal products. But ever since Silk brought the creamy pleasure of soy milk to the mainstream, everybody’s riding the wave. After all, you don’t need a special reason to indulge in great taste.<br>  <br>  Soy milk is loaded with vitamins and minerals your body needs to maintain peak health. It also provides special nutrients called isoflavones that scientists believe may help reduce the risk of certain cancers and provide other important health benefits.<br>  What Are Soy Beans?<br>  <br>  To really understand soy milk, you need to understand the source – soy beans. Soy beans are a high protein bean originally grown in China. Considered a complete protein, they contain all 8 essential amino acids. Low in saturated fat (bad fat), high in polyunsaturated fat (good fat) and cholesterol free, soy beans may be the world’s perfect food.<br>  <br>  Acre for acre, soy can feed more people than practically any other food, and this efficient use of land is just one of the reasons why it’s environmentally friendly. Soy beans are used for much more than soy milk. They’re used in all kinds of foods and even in some unexpected items like crayons.<br>  What Are Isoflavones?<br>  <br>  Isoflavones are considered important components in soy foods that help promote heart health. Isoflavones may also provide:<br>  <br>      * A reduced risk of cardiovascular disease<br>      * Enhanced bone health<br>      * A reduced risk of certain cancers including prostate cancer<br>      * Decreased menopausal symptoms<br>  <br>  Learn how soy m|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	I believe you have to be at a level 2 to vote.. well to give thumbs up/down<br>  <br>  Soy milk contains about the same proportion of protein as cow's milk~ around 3.5%; also 2% fat, 2.9% carbohydrate and 0.5% ash.<br>  <br>  Maybe they should call it soy wannabe milk or soy juice? yuck the thought of it makes me wanna hurl.  Well I don't like milk in general unless it is on cereal or has chocolate mixed in it.<br>  <br>  Have a great week!!<br>  <br>  Cinn =)<br>  <br>  as for how many points you lost it should tell you and sorry I don't recall.<br>  I know I lose 5 of them for asking.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	You can vote at any level.<br>  <br>  Yes, you have lost 5 points, but you can regain 3 points when you choose a best answer.

Then copy the link of the site where your picture is and paste it.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You cannot add the photo directly to the question. However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.

Shouldn't be a problem. But try not to buy stuff on public sharing internet access just to be careful.<br>  And be careful if you're redirected to third party websites. I think, For debit card payments, it can be hard to get your money back. However, with paypal, u can put up a dispute n get your money back easily. Same with credit card, since in a sense ur borrowing the money, u can get ur money back from your credit card bank and the bank will have to deal with the seller you dealt with.<br>  Have fun shopping ;)|`|a6j7Bu9daa	yeps you sure can

5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	The same problem happened last week, with various remedies suggested to fix the problem but none have worked. <br>  <br>  The fact is it’s yahoo fault and until yahoo gets around to fix this problem your only alternatives are to wait for the fix or use your yahoo avatar.|`|v0Bk9fWGaa	theres a change to universal studios ive just read it and things are going dead slow~]|`|7u77AiBjaa	Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), it will display writing/red "x" box or show an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just continue using a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.
JhvqUvlsaa	I know I'll probably be in the minority here but I prefer My Yahoo. I like the gadgets that iGoogle has but My yahoo has the cool email preview and I like the themes and colors you can add. I also like the weather module equally as well as the one iGoogle has. And I like Yahoo mail better than Gmail; I have had a lot of trouble with gmail. =) Hope this helps|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	I like My Yahoo best because it is easier to use as far as adding modules and it has a second page that I use for my interests in cats, space, science, etc. My main page is almost exclusively news, (local, weather, national and world). I just think that the modules and the RSS feeds that My Yahoo has to offer is just plain better that iGoogle and it loads better too.  :)|`|TbSXZ8Ioaa	I personally like Google  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalot better its sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...|`|2bdf1d593cc6344eea70077abcecd363aa	Google is better for looking things up u need and you get it faster!
suPD7c3gaa	Polls & Surveys is a tricky category. All the same rules apply that apply in all other categories on Y!A apply.  Being in information sharing site, I can only guess that the question you asked doesn't fall into the guidelines of information sharing.  There would be nothing of value gained by the answers your question would produce.|`|AA11252878	Chattiness was the reason why your question was deleted. It was neither knowledge-worthy nor advice-seeking. Keep in mind this is the most-violated rule of the Community Guidelines. I strongly suggest you stay away from the Polls and Surveys category because there's already a lot of chattiness going on. Many of those very violations are already being handed out there. Go here to read what the Y!A Team has to say about this: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/abuse/guidelines-14.html;_ylt=Amnj4ITQDa3AbeItZ7R4_7FujSN4">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>|`|VV5KZjGRaa	There was probably a troll patrolling somewhere in a bad mood!<br>  <br>  Edit - not sure hun, I thought it was a perfectly good question, a bit of light hearted fun. Ignore it sweetie, maybe there were too many rude answers. You can always appeal though?|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Someone considered it "chatting", as yu have the word 'you' or 'your' in the body of the question.<br>  <br>  It stinks, as 99.99% of all Polls and Surveys questions are "chatting"|`|bUeMqGgMaa	Because asking what is your most embarresing moment could give personal info.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	You were soliciting personal experiences. The is considered Chat since no knowledge is gained from the answers.  Read the community guidelines and play by the rules|`|AA10132204	Think about it this way.  With the limited number of responses you would get, there is no way two would be alike.  Not much of a poll is it.  That is a great chat room question, so it doesn't belong on YA, even in P&S, because it is only for your entertainment.  If you ask polls, consider they should have some usefulness in the future, so make them such you are likely to get multiple same answers. Also, do not make them personal, that makes them much more like chat when people read them.  For example, "What is the hardest grade in high school?".  That will get multiple same answers and may tell people something if they look at the answers.<br>  <br>  Yes, YA should create a chat room or declare P&S wide open and rename it YA Chat, but until they do, try to stay within the rules.
lkNJNnlSaa	Yes the most is 3.<br>  <br>  You only get one if your special of course.|`|wlPfnQF4aa	The most isn't 3. It CAN go up to 5 but it just isn't shown on their profiles. People CAN do it! One of my contacts did it and he was in 4 cats.|`|niivsTVxaa	a Top Contributor can have a TC badge in 1-3 Categories, currently you cannot be a Top Contributor in any more categories in one period of time.<br>  <br>  There are sometimes a glitch on peoples Avatar-Roll-Over information that claims they are Top Contributor in 4-5 or sometimes even 6 Categories, but when you click on their profile they only have 3.<br>  <br>  But the official limit at this time is: 3 Categories.|`|u7vrul2Faa	The usual maximum is 3 but I have seen people with 4. So I would say 4 is the maximum.
7u77AiBjaa	If you want to access and activate 360 (since it appears that you don't have a 360 space based on your Y/A profile)...<br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> and click on the "Get Started" button to go through the activation process.

Answers are: I enjoy helping people,learning a few things myself, being entertained, meeting people from all walks of life, voicing my opinions on interesting topics.|`|AA10952386	I like the fact that the people who answer my questions know nothing about me, so, unlike my friends, they can offer an unbiased oppinion on something.<br>  The points are no longer important to me as they were when I first started on here. Making contacts is one of the great reasons to be on here  - because then people start to see a progress of your questions and what you value in life - what your dilemas are.

You just need to be picked as best answer a few times a week and you will be TC in that category.

AA10152260	With the rank and file members of the Yahoo staff shrunk by 6000  (laid off) world wide, it may take a while for newly accepted words and proper names to be added to the Y!Dictionary.  Even at full staff, new terms or names took forever or never to make it to the spell check.  I would find it beneficial to have a personal dictionary, as in the e-mail application, to use here on Y!A to add our own custom terms. (Now wouldn't that be Smurfy.)  (Smurfy shows up as a misspelling.)  I should think with one being the newly elected leader of this country, the name really should be entered into the custom dictionary.  I would not think it would be too terribly difficult of a programming task to set the users e-mail custom dictionary to be used here as well, and any of the other portions of their share sites (360 comes to mind).|`|0QRySEuRaa	thats ridiculous! that sure is not a misspelling!

I've also heard that frequent marijuana use can decrease one's sperm count.  That might just be scare tactics though.  Keep trying, it can take some people up to a year or more to become pregnant.  After it's been a year you can see a doctor to get tests done.  Don't try so hard either, it will happen when it does.  Most people I know who quit trying so hard got pregnant almost right away.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	No. The pill effects different people differently, and sometimes for a long time after you stop taking it.|`|3d1c9db58e2469a484839da5f56a6265aa	u really had a bad start.Termination does cause problem and the 2nd miscarriage made it worse.Now  u had Choice on one and not on the other,now every one will ask u why do u want a baby from a man who is having all the other problems .I am sure like any parent u would like to have a healthy child .you are taking even more risk by trying to get pregnant from this man.First of all give it few months after coming off the pill to adjust the body system.In the mean time eat balanced diet and eat fresh foods,salad and a big handful of salads at least twice  or once.drink plenty water,fresh water,fresh air.must think positive all the times and pray to God every day.Read good books,good positive Company and watch good tv programme.Spent most times out doors etc.eat plenty seeds sunflower,pine.sesame seeds.linseed  and few almonds 6-8 soaked in water and peel the skin in the morning and chew it very very slowly.Give it time it will be ok.Must have faith in God and read your bible or what ever religion u have.|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	You've definitely had trauma to your reproductive organs by terminating a pregnancy and the subsequent miscarriage. Those two alone are disastrous to your system. The fact that your boyfriend smokes pot so much could also be a contributing factor; marijuana has been proven to lower sperm count and quality. I don't want to judge, but why would you want to have a baby with a 30-year-old stoner?<br>  <br>  In order to determine your fertility, you can go to the gyno and ask for him to schedule a blood test to check your estrogen levels. Be sure that you've been off the pill long enough to be having your period regularly again. And please, consider what you're doing... 19 is so young to be having a child, especially with a guy 11 years older than you. You need to be 100% sure he's on board with you for this. Remember, you've got your whole life ahead of you! There's no reason to bring a child into this world when you haven't even had the chance to accomplish your own dreams (college, traveling, etc.).

You don't say if you're using your contact list, or putting the names in the bcc field in some other way.  You can go through your Contacts and put a check next to the ones you want on the bcc list, then click "Add checked contacts" to add them to your email.  I've never gone the "shirft/control" method.  Be careful how many people you're forwarding to and what you're forwarding.
