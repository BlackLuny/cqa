AFTER A FEW DAYS SHE WAS MUCH BETTER.|`|NbvTyN7saa	Often animals esp. cats get sick from vaccines.  Thankfully your kitten is a bit older.  Hopefully they will bounce back in a day or two.  Watch for a fever, lethargy (very, lazy) and off food the next day.  Diahreaha and vomiting also  more serious.  Call the vet in that case.|`|AA11711024	my cats both did the same thing when they had their medicene, they really werent themselfes.  they got over it, your cat will be fine

Just choose a fish small enough for a 10-gallon (guppies, for example) and give them other fish small enough to fit in their mouths (newly-hatched fry, for example).    Most of the the famous predatory fishes (piranhas, snakeheads, gar, Oscars and other cichlids, etc.), though, are too large for a 10-gallon or even a 20-gallon tank.|`|0TFuR8IRaa	I'm a fan of bala sharks get up to 13 inches depending on tank size and you can already buy them at a large size from most pet stores. they will defiantly eat some types of fish|`|07lCZh28aa	a piranha. But, why would you put him in a 10 gallon tank? And otherwise, it's a little cruel to put it in a tank that small, unless you just keep one. Oscars in a 10 gal won't work either. They grow too big and they are nasty to clean up after. Put aside 2 days a week cleaning up after this guy.    Even at 20 gals, the oscar will outgrow it. Get a snake head. They are nasty!|`|EKg97zZlaa	DON't get an Oscar,10/20 gallons is WAY to small for an Oscar,they need at least 40 gallons it's only ok if you will move them to a larger tank when they get bigger (they can get bigger than 4 inches)    Piranhas are also not that good of a choice for 10 gallons,but mayby for a 20 gallon    i suggest you get 2 Convict Cichlids they are cheap and will not get to big for a 10/20 gallon tank.|`|45Cbtd7raa	get a cichlid african or South american.

I think if you are looking to find fish that will eat other fish just because that's what you prefer then I would have to say African Chiclids. They are really aggressive, and will eat other community fish like gold fish of the sort.     Also, there are your Oscars, Flower Horns, and porana.. There are so many different South Africans, or just African fish, but those are your most aggressive fish for sure.    I have put them all sorted together in a 55 gallon, and they will get along for the most part, but as soon as you put something in the lines of a goldfish, or community fish in general in the tank then they get eat quick. they are  intimidated by the African, and get killed every time.|`|ssHzAVlwaa	Well, if you get an oscar, it will outgrow the tank in a couple of months. I would go with an african cichlid. They are beautiful to look at and te eat other fish. Start them off with guppies and they'll work their way up to small feeders.|`|19iyBoD3aa	one convict will be good for that but if its 20 gallon you can have two of them|`|psqkf6rMaa	dwarf puffers or a green puffer they are mean|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	African Clawed Frog will fit in a 10 galllon and it eats fish...    other than that DONT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE    NEVER put an Oscar, Pirahana, or Goldfish in a 10 gallon fish tank ever.

Ummm. in a 20 gallon angel fish will eat really small .5-1" Rosey Minnows...    try that i your really that interested in watching them eat fish... lol.      other than that you can put an oscar in a 55 gallon aquarium and he will gobble up goldfish and get around 12"     hope i helped, and do some research please... i wasted a lot of money without doing research so im doin u a favor.|`|ot8tImmcaa	Well i think a betta will kill|`|a85b2e371a2478795bd26e46189bcf5eaa	An elephant fish. no joke it ate all 5 of my goldfish in a day.|`|3788e558db37b44f3577186d780dfdd6aa	it depends in what fish it will eat, if they are not the same kind, put 1 aruana and the rest are guppies. if all the same, put 10 angel fishes and wait for who will survive last.|`|496e7a1baa81aea865b0b44909bb9234aa	Oscars|`|hzxQMU0Caa	one south american leaf fish
179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Assuming you'll be there an hour at a time, that's 4 hours a day-- times 7 days a week-- that's 28 hours total.    Figure out a fair hourly rate, and multiply.    For this particular job (it sounds relatively easy-- cage cleaning, dog walking, feeding, and playing) I would charge just a few dollars.    28x $3.00= $84.00    For me?  I would just round it down to $80.00    Ultimately, you should talk to the person who needs your services and decide with THEM what would be fair.
dcc094e2921578d9e4b6e4f1fe43a6d8aa	Doesn't appear to be an open wound or infection.  It's either a cyst (natural) or a bug bite (climate pending of course!)  Even spiders are out year round.    It seems to me like it should go away on it's own.  However, if it doesn't go away, or most importantly, gets very hard it might be a tumor.  Luckily, most tumors in animals tend to be non-cancerous.  But it's most likely a cyst.  Feel free to e-mail me if you'd like a cyst treatment option, though like I said, it should go away on it's own.|`|doWkvrDNaa	cats have bactera under there nails and it is more than likely for it to be pussy if the swelling dont go down see a vet|`|AA10372466	I know how expensive it can be to visit a veterinarian.  They are not cheap visits by any means.  However, have you considered taking Jackly to see someone at your humane society shelter?  Perhaps someone there would be kind enough to look at him for free or for a small donation to the shelter.  The outdoors is a dangerous world for a cat.  My suggestion is to try turning him into an indoor cat.  You will have fewer worries that way.  Good luck to him and you.|`|R2Rg9ZtTaa	Ok im guessing that the cat has scratched himself but just to be safe  take him to the vet|`|pOqzNsdpaa	stop being an idoit and don't let your cat outside unless to play but keep your eye on it. your cat is a animal and it will fight other cats or dogs or whatever animal because it is territorial.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	its an abscess,it has to be lanced.  would you do it at home?  go to an SPCA or humane society vet clinic?  the abscess is a pocket full of pus.  the vet would lance it and flush it.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	You said you can't afford to take the cat to the vet, a lot of people are having that problem during the financial crisis. From the looks of it, it really doesn't look like anything really serious. If there is no indication of a wound than it is probably swollen tissue from a bump of some kind. If it feels like fluid under the skin this could be a sign of infection. Just watch it for a few days and see if it gets better, it might on its own. I've had old barn cats come home looking a lot worse than that and they got better on their own. You might want to try to keep him inside if possible.|`|4aAhEK9daa	If you don't have the money to get your cat medical care when he needs it why on earth do you let him run around outdoors where the likelihood of injury is so high?  And when you KNOW that he "always gets in fights with other cats"?     Either get him to the vet NOW or surrender him to your nearest no-kill shelter so he can get the care he needs.  If you don't I will track your IP address and let your local animal control know that you have an injured animal that you're denying treatment for.  That is considered ANIMAL ABUSE and a chargeable felony in most areas.  Want to go to jail?|`|QWFFITfjaa	It is most likely an infection due to a scratch, it really is hard to tell though just from the photos. but that would be my guess. I would suggest though that you get him to a vet or something. some vets allow for some kind of payment plans.
p3vjvzRPaa	Firstly, good on you for adopting an older dog - that is fantastic!!    About the not being able to tell where the sound is coming from...he may be deaf in one ear.  Dalmatians can be prone to deafness (do a google search for more info).  Deafness in one ear is not a major problem (I know 2 dogs with this problem and it's only an issue if they run off too far at a park and can't tell where you're calling from).    About the toys.. if he is happy, does it matter if he doesn't play with toys?    If you'd like him to play with toys with you, then keep doing what you've been doing - having a toy with food inside is a good start.  Basically keep associating toys with positive things (like food).    Reward him for any interest he shows in toys - you can do this as a proper training exercise.    The training notes on this site may help: http://www.geocities.com/apexboxers/flyg...  (particularly the ones on 'Focus / Ball motivation')     I have taught a dog who wasn't interested in toys to become obsessed with tennis balls by following the training regime above.    The basic idea is to choose a particular toy to start with and teach him that it is something positive.  Don't leave the toy lying about, bring it out for 'training sessions' only.  If he sniffs at, praise and give him a treat, if he moves the toy accidentally, praise and reward.  Over time he will look forward to that toy coming out.  You gradually increase your expectations - i.e. you expect him to purposefully move the toy before he'll get rewarded etc.  Eventually he'll learn to love the toy and you can stop treating it as a training exercise.    If you are patient I am sure he will gain in confidence and learn to play with you.|`|cRM9H3kGaa	well i dont know if dalmations are very playful well youll just have to get it started it will come around usally you can get them to play somehow that is weird that it wont play try a rope toy usally i think it is the best to start out with my dog a jack russel we got her a rope and she and us played tug a war or maybe it is always tired mostly puppies are hyper but some aeem to always sleep!|`|fDVUbzv2aa	smear them with a little peanut butter (don't worry they don't get salmonella) and there are some pet stores that sell dog treat cream and reward him more when he plays with them|`|ZCeZ6hNJaa	Congratulations on your adoption. The caveat with adopting a dog is you never really know their history. It is very possible that your dog was mistreated and therefore can be submissive or out of character for the combined breed.     Cattle dogs wait for their 'job or sheep' or in your case the other dog to make the first move. This is instinct. Nothing to worry about. They are there to collect and keep the 'job' stable for the human, waiting for further direction.    Why don't you try bonding through long, brisk walks, along with bike rides if possible. This way the dog trusts you as the pack leader on a primitive basis.     This is a dog that wants to collect and round up moving objects, and not play tug of war. Squeaky toys may represent a hurt prey, in his case his responsibility, and therefore would set him into panic. These dogs are bred to keep and protect, not seek and destroy.|`|80S8U7Edaa	When I rescued my dog, she didn't wanna play with toys at all. It took several months for her to come around. You have to be patient. Be very kind to the dog and show that the toys are alright. Leave them out, and let him get to them on his own time. It just takes time for them to get comfortable in their new home. Once he feels completely safe, he'll probably come around.
cvP7wQp4aa	We had the same problem with our dog essentially what you wanna do is lean them off ppl food it isnt good for there stomachs and there are plenty of people at purina getting paid to design dog food for your pup.Now mix in steak or what not in with wet food gradually decreasing amount of people food. Sorta like an addiction because thats all it is I heard of people adding A-1 to there dogs dry food too but i dont know if that works. I hope you can get your dog off this because it is really un healthy for them.|`|PTP8ptDbaa	you have to stop giving him human food it will make him sick!|`|NbvTyN7saa	The odds are good that she is very sensitive to a lot of stuff that is in kibble and other dog foods and she knows it.  Talk to a dog nutritionist and work on a home cooked diet with her.  You want to do this properly for her to have a balanced diet.
gjD8pndjaa	Prices are typically discussed after the other aspections of purchasing have been considered.  Some breeders will let you know their prices if you contact them privately.    What breeders want to avoid is people "shopping around" for the lowest prices.    and typically if price is your number one priority, thats probably not the kind of owner a good breeder is looking for|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Well mainly because there are no puppies for sale on our web site.    We have a waiting list if you would like to plunk down a $500 deposit tho'.|`|MfcTIdlraa	I am looking for a pup for a rescue.  I don't want to see prices on a breeders website.  I would go to a pet store if I want that. (NOT)  And I WILL NOT encourage puppy mills!  I have gone on the web already and have found my rescue dog.  I have made arrangements for his purchase and transportation with his breeder.    Reputable breeders of any breed are very cautious of their baby's new homes and rightly so.  Applications and home visits are often the case.  Please don't be put off by this.  My breeders have always done their best to protect their pups from any harm.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Theres no need to, it allows potential buyers to take the first step and call us to find out. Once they call us and we tell them it weeds them out. But they at least called.    Price shouldnt be an issue and if it is i would never put them on my waiting list.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	same as with cats - price with vary depnding on if you want to show the naimal or not, if you want papers.  if you don't get the animal de-sexed they will often chanrge alot more.    Some think that you don't need a price as your buying the animal based on what you like and want, not on what's the cheapest pet is.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Because the price should not be at the top of your list of worries. If you are in the market for a dog from a good breeder, you should already know how much money you should have socked away, plus more for supplies and vet bills.     The people who call up breeders with the first question out of their mouth being "How much?" are usually the ones who can't afford to own a dog in the first place. Breeders want to place dogs with families who are financially secure. The price tag of the dog is not going to be the biggest expense.
u1HahCoqaa	Haha, the HB sucks, doesnt it? Im taking mine in the fall, luckily.    Have you looked in you B/A manual? The orange one?  Almost everything should be in there, or in one of the other manuals.....If you don't have one get one! I personally think it's the best manual of them all. And you can find them for about $17 on Amazon...    And no, it isnt cheating to ask, but it is kinda lazy....I mean, hundreds of C2's have taken their HB without basically posting half of the test on Yahoo Answers.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I agree, it's not actually cheating, but it is pretty lazy, and it's not in keeping with Pony Club values.  Also, you really should get the "pony club approved" answers from legitimate sources, not from a bunch of people with an unknown level of knowledge.  You want to make sure you are giving the answers they're wanting to hear.    Try this link, it is great:  http://midcal.ponyclub.org/study_aids.ht...|`|NbvTyN7saa	Is that all?
ktC40jtXaa	Aww they are soooo cute. I would say that Cali looks like she has some border collie in her.

I'm young, so i'm not 100% positive, so i might be wrong, but I think she could be german shepard, rottwieler mix. But like i said i could be wrong.    Her color clues me in to the german shepard, and her build.  I think she could be a rottweiler because of the brown tufts above her eyes. ( my fave. part about a rottweiler)|`|5IcNNkkuaa	One thing I can tell you for sure, is that is not an Australian Shepherd.     Due to the coloration, and general shape, it looks more like a Border Collie, or a mix there of. That's what happens when you by from a BYB or pet store supplied by puppy mills. Had you gone to a recognized, well experienced breeder, you would not have had to guess that breed.
8owlj2xHaa	This is similar to the ones Reef keepers use. It plugs in and stays in your tank or filter, just needs to stay wet.  Constant reading, lasts for years. http://cgi.ebay.com/pH-Meter-Adaptor-Ele...    Here is a handheld type.  battery operated, dip it in the tank take the reading.

They are like 7-10 bucks(for each one) a pop, but are really good for a month or so. Keeps you without having to keep testing every week. They have them in Petco and Petsmart.
gjD8pndjaa	They are expensive dogs, sadly, because they are quite rare.      They are NOT the dog for everyone.  If you're just getting one because they don't bark, you're in for a big wake up call.  They are a very independent dog breed, meaning they aren't as domesticated as other breeds, closer to being "wild".  Harder to train, harder to live with.    http://www.luxorbasenjis.com/Is%20a%20Ba...  http://www.akalebasenjis.com/rightbasenj...    Under $500 for a puppy is extremely unlikely.  You may be able to find a breeder willing to place a retired adult for less|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Basenji are medium-sized dogs.  You're not going to find one that is "tiny."  They also aren't cheap.  They aren't a particularly common breed and they can be prone to expensive medical problems (GI issues such as allergies and irritable bowl can be common in this breed, both conditions require expensive prescription diets and often long-term medication).  I also don't know that I would call them "great family dogs," they certainly can get along with kids but they are generally going to be less tolerant of small children and their abuse than a more laid back breed.  And while they don't bark, they have this screeching, piercing yodel that they use about as often as any breed that does bark...that most people find MUCH worse than a regular bark.  They are notoriously "difficult" to train because they have a mind of their own and there really has to be something in it for them or they really won't see the point of doing what you are asking them to do.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	They don't bark, but that doesnt mean they are silent by any means. They yodel and they can whine and make a myriad of other doggy noises.     Well bred dogs cost about $800-1000. There is no such thing as a cheap, well-bred dog. It is an oxymoron. If you can't afford to purchase a well-bred dog, contact breed rescue or go adopt a dog from a shelter.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	The breed standard comes in one size. "Ideal height for dogs is 17 inches and bitches 16 inches. Dogs 17 inches and bitches 16 inches from front of chest to point of buttocks. Approximate weight for dogs, 24 pounds and bitches, 22 pounds. Lightly built within this height to weight ratio."    A baseji is a baseji, all the same size, unless the runt. If it is a pure-breed, it will be expensive. A good breeder, breeds for quality, not quantity, thus they are not cheap. They are also quite independent, as far as breeds go.     Try a local shealter, you might get lucky.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    try this dogfinder to see a list of adoptable dogs near you:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=551717064483...    hope this helps.|`|2k8d8Tuhaa	missin_y0u, I love the personality of a basenji.

Well... immediately upon leaving the bag my beta went after it. But he could not fit it in his mouth. Although I didn't give him a chance to finish it, it could be possible. Sorry to hear that though.|`|TpJbtJCfaa	Yeh that's the only explanation.    Beta are fighter fish... you don't put them with others!|`|uPri5JEpaa	im sure the beta  ate your other fish its more common|`|wtIWal7Waa	I had 4 neon tetras, and 2 disappeared within a week...    I noticed the other fish eating one of the remains of a tetra the next day, so it's likely your tetra died and was eaten.|`|grklGFwBaa	NOM NOM NOM NOM      Betas are supposed to be on their own. They are extremely territorial.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I've had neon tetras jump out of the tank. I only found them much later, in the form of "carpet jerky."    All fish are potentially jumpers, although some jump more often and more enthusiastically than others.    The tetra also could have been eaten by your betta. A neon tetra is probably too big for a betta to swallow, but the neon could have died and then the betta could have eaten the carcass.    Please note that the name of the Siamese Fighting Fish is "Betta," with two "t"s. "Beta" is the second letter of the Greek alphabet, not the name of a fish.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	The beta probably did eat him.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	he may have|`|Zf18VjlCaa	Could have been eaten, could have gotten out of the tank.

That would be the fish's spine and the knob is it's skull.  I doubt the betta could have eaten the bones.  But it could have already gone up into the filter.  My mollies killed my chinese algae eater about a month ago and that's all that was left of him the next morning.  I saw it before the filter got it.  :(
JfBzzXQ4aa	If your dog is only 1yr old & has "pills the doctor recommended for arthritis pain" he obviously has some serious orthopedic issues. I'm sure your vet or orthopedic specialist has told you what is causing his problems. Ask that treating vet if the dog should even be going up & down stairs or not.  Also if the dog is overweight, keeping him trim will help not to aggravate his arthritic pain.|`|Yh0oQEPHaa	dude...hes getting old, he cant do that stuff anymore. i'd prepare yourself for his passing theres nothing worse than being too attached to a dog after he dies the pain is horrible.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Even on the meds he is still a bit uncomfortable it seems and with age this is to be expected so maybe bring him back to the vet to let him know that the med he is on does not quite take away his pain.But just remember that there is only so much that can be done for arthritis and at some point he will just stop wanting to go up stairs all together.So i wish you the best of luck with this...|`|69xuw29Baa	ok for the first problem you need to make assoications    he needs to associate going down the stairs with something he cannot resist snack go for walk favorite toy with enough time he will forget all about the act of going down the stairs and it will happen before you know it. Youll laugh hell run down the stairs and wait for you to give him the reward.    second this is going to take some work and you are going to have to be athoritative to make it work.    Take a walk and try this: If he is a chaser throw a ball or a toy and get him to acknowledge that its out there for him to get once that happens put the leash on. Now throw the ball and hold him at the leash and speak the command "STAY" or "DOWN" in a much deeper voice then when you are happy. Once he stays let him off the leash and play some more. try this again the next day. This time do this 2 - 3 times during the session. Gradually increase this routine till he responds to your voice even before you throw the ball. Once this command/relationship is in place you can try the interaction with the other animals but keep him on the lease until you can be sure this technique works then allow some play...      CHOCOLATE LABS RULE!|`|HKoo2PfYaa	Sorry to hear about your problem- I have a lab as well...How old is your lab?  Labs are famous for having arthritis problems, sometimes as young as age 7.  This is a pretty typical problem, and unfortunately if you have some meds from the vet and the dog is still not going up stairs, he or she might continue this and not be able to - it is important not to push him or her as it will be painful to do and this is why they are avoiding it - I would continue to talk with your vet and perhaps move the dog bed downstairs and make his or her life convenient going forward - I wish you good luck!|`|OpkuaKiYaa	Put his dog food at the top.|`|DTTROeA0aa	Have his hips x-rayed so that you know whether it is just arthritis or if it is a problem with his hips - dogs that cannot go up stairs may have hip dysplasia - and you can discuss treatment options with your vet.|`|JV0i77uiaa	My sister had the same problem, she used to give her dog a pill, but the dog could not make it upstairs.

When it comes to trends in food, both human and pet, the focus continues to shift to natural, holistic and organic options. These terms are becoming a part of our everyday vernacular but what do they really mean when referring to the food we choose to feed our pets?          Many pet food manufacturers have been jumping on the natural and organic bandwagon, but much of the terminology used to define these diets isn't actually defined by law. Cutting through the clutter of jargon can help pet owners make an educated and informed decision about what they are feeding their pets while also knowing what is safe and governed by standards and regulations.          First and foremost it is important to note that the terms "natural" and "organic" are not interchangeable nor do they mean the same thing. In order for pet foods to be deemed "organic" they must follow USDA rules and regulations and will have the USDA organic seal on the packaging. "Natural" pet foods are also legally defined and, according to Association of American Food Control Officials (AAFCO) standards, if a pet food is deemed "natural" all the ingredients must be natural and without any chemical alterations.           When it comes to terms like "holistic" and "human grade" both are not legally defined. "Holistic" regulations and standards have not been formalized with regards to pet food and any manufacturer can make that claim on their labels or packaging. A claim the food is "human grade" is also misleading unless the entire product is edible by humans, in accordance to USDA and FDA standards.           If you want to choose a food for your pet that is not within the traditional pet food spectrum, it is important to seek out a reputable manufacturer who is clearly adhering to the guidelines discussed above. Many natural pet foods, such as Nature's Best from Hill's Pet Nutrition, offer the same level of quality and nutritional science of regular foods but also meet the regulations and legal definitions of a natural food, meaning all the ingredients used are natural and have not been chemically altered in any form. Pet owners can have peace of mind knowing their pet is being fed a natural food that will also provide the dietary support they need to live full and happy lives.|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	They're both good dog foods.

I tried the apple cider vinegar, alcohol, etc. and it didn't work at all.  Zymox Otic with Hydrocortisone is the most amazing product.  It works for both yeast and bacterial ear infections.

The grocery store brand ACV is crap though-- you should try to get a raw, unfiltered, organic brand, like Braggs.    Braggs can be found at any health food store, or at local grocery stores in their health food section.    We also keep his ears clean, and DRY as yeast thrives in moist dark places.|`|fDVUbzv2aa	I think it would be best to get a second opinion from another vet and try looking into what it is and see if someone has a good suggestion but check with a good vet before trying anything posted here|`|CkecSp4Uaa	If she currently has an active yeast infection then you are probably going to need to use medication to get rid of it.  If you've been to the vet for this same problems "a million times" then you probably have some extra medication laying around from a previous infection.  Just check the expiration date on the tube before you use it.  If the infection does not start to clear up in the standard amount of time then you'll have to bite the bullet and take her in to the vet to make sure there isn't some other problem going on.  Clean her ears DAILY while treating.  Once you get the infection under control you really need to be on top of keeping her ears clean to help prevent infections and catch them in their earliest stages when they are easier to treat.  For many dogs with chronic ear infections this means cleaning at LEAST once a week, for particularly bad ears it could be as often as every three days or every other day.    You should also take a close look at the food you are feeding.  Dogs with allergies tend to get chronic ear infections, so if this is a recurrent problem there is a pretty good chance that your dog may have some food allergies.  The most common ingredients to cause allergies include corn, wheat, and soy although a dog can be allergic to any ingredient.  If your food contains any of these ingredients you should seriously consider switching to a different food.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    But of course they're also remarkable hearing devices, far more sensitive than our ears and capable of hearing at a higher frequency.

Estrus ("heat") is the mating period of female animals. When estrus occurs, animals are said to be "in heat" or "in season." Dogs generally have their first estrous cycle at 6-12 months of age. Some females of the large breeds, however, may not have their first estrus until they are 12-24 months of age.     The complete cycle takes about 6 months, resulting in 2 estrous periods each year. Individual variation occurs, but a given female's pattern tends to be repeated regularly.     The estrous cycle can be divided into 4 stages:    1. Proestrus: This stage begins with the appearance of vaginal bleeding. It normally lasts from 4 to 9 days. Male dogs become very interested in the female; however, she will not yet mate with them.     2. Estrus: This is the stage in which the female will accept the male and conception can occur. The vaginal discharge is more yellowish than bloody. Ordinarily, the stage lasts for 4 to 13 days. Your female will stand still and hold her tail to the side when you touch her back or a male dog tries to mount.     3. and 4. Metestrus and anestrus: These 2 stages are periods of ovarian activity, but with no significant outward signs. False pregnancies frequently occur during metestrus.     Some Important Points    * You should consider your pet to be "in season" for 21 days: 7 days coming into heat, 7 days in heat, 7 days going out. Though conception is most likely during the middle 7 days, Mother Nature doesn't always follow the rules. Confine your pet for the entire 3 weeks.    * Remember that the above information is general. Not all females follow these patterns. Consult with the doctor if your pet does not seem typical. Sometimes, cycling problems can be an early warning of more serious problems, and the sooner they are dealt with, the better.     Hope this information was helpful and good luck with in the journey with your puppy!|`|THuplVHpaa	Doggy Diapers, for sure.|`|062cfd9edb812ebceaa817bc46b024eaaa	Go to Wal-Mart for some carpet cleaner.|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	my dog is too, there's nothing you can really do.

Also i was told dogs don't feel cramps so there not really in pain but they can act more lazy. GOOD LUCK|`|Za8DpfvQaa	I think you mean "heat." Have her spayed now, or after her heat session.

u61yKsE3aa	where do you live because lots of places arn't good to keep a reptile out side year round. If you are somewhere warm turtles, tortoises, and any large reptile like iguannas, monitors, etc are all good choices as long as you are an experienced reptile owner if your not as experianced I would stick with the turtles and tortoises outside.    In bocca the weather is nice I'm jealous.  Which ever reptile you go with tou will need to provide plenty of non toxic plants and hides for shade to exscape the heat on really hot days.  Depending on which reptile you go with you prolly won't need any supplemental heat.   So my next questions to help you choose would be how much experiance do you have with herps? How much space do you have (ie how big of a cage are we looking at building?) and Whats your budget?  These will all make a difference on what you get.|`|TIGZp5yzaa	iguana! lol|`|xAibdGsTaa	mayby some type of tropical bird if you live somewere warm|`|xZTioRSpaa	reptiles cant be always kept outside because of weather. they are cold blooded so whatever the temp is there body temp changes to that. if it is hot outside they need to be cooled otherwise they might overheat. if its cold they need heat so they don't freeze. but some reptiles can be out when its hot. but not in the cold. so depending on where u live in Florida depends on the weather year round. you should probably talk to whoever u wish to get an animal from. but the best animal i can think of for where u live would be a turtle. maybe a desert tortoise or something like that. good luck with the reptile hunt!!|`|8Trv4fqnaa	A  turtle! But i dont think its a good idea to let it run around freely if its too small because there is a good chance something might eat it!

Of course you can get a smaller one and keep it inside something untill it grows up a bit.|`|AA11100425	What you need is the Western Fence Lizard. It sounds like the perfect pet for you. They're cool looking too. They can be left outdoors in a cage and are easy to care for.    This aptly named lizard enjoys sitting on prominent points, like fence posts, where it can sun itself, and watch for food and predators. Like many species of lizards, this one is able to change its general coloration to match its background. Light colored lizards placed on dark rocks become a darker color. Interestingly, some lizards remain dark when placed on a light background, mimicking a shadow cast by an imperfection or crack in the rock surface.It is commonly found from the coast to the highest mountain areas at over 6,000 feet. It isn't found in the desert. This lizard is conspicuous and common in its range. It thrives in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from coastal sage scrub and chaparral on the coast and foothills, to the forests of higher elevations. It's usually found on or near the ground, in rock and wood piles, tree trunks, and the lower branches of shrubs.It mostly eats insects, so to feed it you could buy already prepared crickets or catch your own if you don't mind that sort of thing. Its nick name is the Blue Belly because of the blue patches on its body. Let me find a picture.................................... here: http://www.amandafritz.com/files/lizard8...    Cool huh?
CVXCSTHoaa	No you do not need to be in 4-h to show. But you will get more enjoyment with it meeting new people and learn new things.    To join 4-h there should be an extension office in your area for example type your county's name here extension office in the search bar and it should show you it, if not ask in your school.    You can not register a lionhead in the ARBA they still are not a reconized breed yet. But you dont need that to show in shows. It just has to be a purebred animal, Now where i live no fairs have a spot for lionhead rabbits but they have a section called pets.    This is my first year showing in 4-h so i am not sure how their shows are set up, but at our fair we have cages where they are kept the week of the fair then on the day of the show i start about an hour before my class getting them ready i normaly only have 3 this year i will be taking more, on the day of the show there is tables set up and there should be a list of judges and what they will be judging and look for your breed or group and that the table you will have to be there should be more cages set up and you take them and put them in the cages, the judges do the rest, at showmenship you will keep your rabbit, this one is judge on an open table and the judge will come and pose the rabbit and you  must show him the nails,the sex, and check for mites, and show the judge the tattoo number also no all information on the breed and some other breeds as well as he may ask you to look at another rabbit and the same thing make sure you know how to hold your rabbit walking to the show table and how to pick him up and look at his sex.    Also let me mention this your rabbit does need a tattoo to show in ANY show and this does include 4-h.    I will list some sites that helped me the first one is by a lionhead breeder so that will help a little more.    Enjoy your shows and rabbit if you need anything you can email me.|`|aBLYU5FKaa	First off, I'm not sure that Lionheads are a recognized breed yet.  You could show them at the county fair level with 4H, but I'm not sure if you would be elligible for state fair.      If you want to join 4H, call your local extension office.  It is really fun, and I would recommend it.|`|hZ9omSataa	i showed sheep in HS, I tried to raise some rabbits, but they all became murderers and killed each other...|`|OyTC9qalaa	At MY county fair--    No you dont have to be in 4H, or FFA, you just need to be under 21  You DO NOT have to register your rabbit    You have to take care of your rabbit at the fair, [feed, water, groom it]    You will have to pay a entry fee more than likely, but you could also win money.    Showing at the fair is fun, its the biggest thing I look forward to every year.        Also, just because your animal may be Purebreed, that dosent really matter, because most rabbits there will be purebreed also.    Whats going to matter is the body struvture of your rabbit.  Look up some previous Grand Champion Lionhead Rabbits and look at them and compare it to your rabbit.    Also you may want to look up the standard for lionheads.|`|McjaM0hDaa	go on web to your local fair grounds/ 4-h thing and see if they have a page, if they do all the info should be on it. and i have never showed a bunny so idk, but ive show a cow and sheep.  and all i think you have to do is show its legs and stuff and know the answers to the q's the Judges will ask.   o if you know of a 4-h leader he/ she can sin you up.   and i would hurry because you only have so long to sin up!!  good luck!! and if you do join you will have fun!!!
u61yKsE3aa	It sounds like wet tail but with out having a vet check it you can't know for sure.  They sell medicine for wet tail at most petstores it's called dry tail.  Also cabbage can aid with wet tail until you can get to the pet store.  If it is wet tail and you start treatment asap she should be ok. If you treat for wet tail and it's not working or she gets worse get her to  a vet.  Hope that helps|`|pkz2lELgaa	what did you expect? its a nasty hamster.|`|mSHxDFcJaa	Aw poor little guy. I don't know what's wrong with him or her but hope it gets better :)|`|jKA8SovQaa	it's not wet tail, it's because the hamster is " in season" meaning mating season, i give my hamsters bathes, once monthly, because of the smell i couldn't stand it buy some some light animal shampoo put a little on its stomach and all around its coat, wash it off and it'll most likely be gone. well anymore questions ill be happy to answer :P|`|QrjjiOgTaa	it will not go away on its own, it will die from it. the best thing you can do is call the vet and give it antibiotics called baytril. feed it lab block and timothy hay and thats all. keep the cage clean and don't play with him until he gets better. if you really, really, really can't call a vet they sell a drug call dritail at some pet stores.
A1CUNfNcaa	I had a problem with my cat too.  I found a good article about jumping on counters that is too long to give here but here is the link.  I tried the tape method and it worked for me.

Good luck!|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You can try putting something like aluminum foil on the counter top because cats don't appreciate the noise it makes.  Or you can take tape and roll it over so that the sticky side is exposed and put it on the counter top.  Cats will NOT like the tape either.|`|8ba614025fcbb970cec97e3f152d6d21aa	I saw this on TV, but it said to take a long strip of tape and put it on the edge of the counter/table (sticky side up). When the cat tries to jump up, it's feet will touch the stickiness and they don't like it :)    What I do on my kitchen table is pull the chairs out then slant them forward so the back two feet are off the ground and the back is leaning against the table so he can't jump on the chairs.    Another thing that works...put a bunch of pennies in a can.  When your cat jumps up, shake it vigorously but try not to let him see that it's you doing it.  It will startle him and he probably won't do it anymore.    Best of luck|`|xEhA0qHpaa	My cat jumps onto out counter where we eat. The only way to prevent this is to roll up a newspaper and lightly tap the table and say No!|`|AA11736483	This is difficult if you own a cat. The floor is cold and also makes a cat feel vulnerable - they like high places. Your best bet is to get a cat tree or house, or let the cat use specific furniture to satisfy its need.   When you bring an animal into your home, you can't restrict it to live like a human - that is very unfair and unrealistic.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	Since cats instinctively like to get to high areas it is a difficult thing to teach them to stay off of counter tops. What always worked for me was double sided tape and boundary spray. I would spray the counter tops with the spray (it is unappealing to animals) and lay double-sided tape down. When my kitty would jump up there it would usually get a whiff of the spray first and not bother or he would be trying to avoid the tape. Eventually he just learned it wasn't worth the trouble.    I personally would try the tape only at first. The counters will need to be wiped down every time you use them if you spray.|`|1827d79e1a59bbeb213b8e03785ba568aa	tell them "no" and smack the cat down. my cat is 8 years old, and now that i have did the same thing for so long, she knows not to get on the counter top, or even on the couch if i dont want her to.

That might have been the problem as another answerer mentioned ammonia spike. If you don't have a filter, get one. Everything can be sterilized. Make a solution of bleach and water. An old nurse told me how to test for the proper concentration: Fill a container with water. Add very small amounts of bleach until the water feels "slippery" between your fingers. That solution will kill any germs. You will have to toss the plants. If they are expensive you might be able to sterilize them with bromide blue. Ask an experienced aquarist.

I doubt that you'll see results overnight and so you'll have to give them both time to adapt to each other's presence and see how they get along.|`|AwicI0VJaa	your cat would have to get used to the dog which will take time but eventually they will get along. if you get a puppy it will be fine with the cat if you get a dog then you may have problems|`|AjwW8w4raa	i have a cat and a dog. i had the cat for 3 yrs be-for i got my dog. at first my cat didn't like the dog to come near it but after a week or so the cat scratched the dog and after dat they where fine the cat is definitely the boss lol. i would advise you to get your dog as a puppy because then you will have the opportunity to teach your dog to live with a cat. i hope i could be of help and please let me know how you get on.  gemma x
xi9amEG2aa	Ugh....that is riduclus!  Next, they're going to have a micro-mini Irish Wolfhound!!  I agree...it's getting WAY out of control.  Those stupid people just want like $800 and up for a badly bred puppy.  They could care less about the dogs/puppies health, they just want money.  Yeah, everybody wants some extra money these days, but come on....quit mixing breeds that weren't meant to be mixed!  I've seen a site on micro Yorkies....they looked sickly!  Some of them at 8 weeks were half the size of a can of Pepsi!!  The Yorkie is already small enough, why would anybody want one smaller?!?!      People are stupid and will do anything for money.      ****OMG!!  I looked at that first site you listed and the 'mini' St. Bernards, and they contradicted themselves....either that, or they don't know what a pure breed is.  They said that they don't breed mutts...but yet they have one dog on there that is 1/2 St. Bernard and 1/2 Cocker Spaniel.  Last time I checked, crossing two different breeds was a mutt.  *mutters...f'in morons*|`|QVP8zSuWaa	OMG I am in shock. These people have no shame. Down right gross.  I am going to email them and ask them about a black and white mini St Bernard, bet they would come up with it.  Gees I wish I lived somewhere within reason of there  add: oh well they already have a black and white>>  Maybe I will say I want to stud my Rott with a mini brown and white?|`|P8Q39vA4aa	They make me sick. OMG i almost thought i would have to run down the hall to puke in the bathroom.     Someone should report them.     Thats just disgusting and yeah that whole hibrid vigor they believe in is BS.|`|h6t4aRUOaa	Cool, now I can get the apartment sized Great Dane I always wanted, you know to fit in my Designer Tote bag. For God's sake. Someone needs to start making these people take a test before they get licensed. And the morons that actually pay and get hosed, I don't feel sorry for them. I feel for these pups when the fads are over. soon we'll see the puggle rescues and ****-oodle pounds. Christ, people get a hobby that doesn't involve manipulating and exploiting living beings.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	I agree.  It's just money-hungry breeders.  Greed, just plain greed.|`|eTsCJYALaa	Both places sound like puppy mills. I'm  sure that all of their "specialty dogs" (mutts with a fancy name) will populate many shelters in the area.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	Holy Sh*t!    Couldn't they find the local, neighborhood Heinz 57 to throw in with that "mini St. Bernard" BS?  That is by far the most disgusting example of breeding I have seen yet!  And for what?|`|sOkePjK3aa	OMG that's so greedy. Crossbreeding is just money making whatever. Did you look at the 'Why do we crossbreed' page? That is terrible!! What creeps! What is wrong with them? Can't they find another way to make money without destroying puppies' lives? That is so mean. >:[|`|b4NcFBhraa	That's sickening, but hey... what can we do? I wish we could just want something to stop or start and it did it, but sadly it cant. Things happen. Take the holocaust for example. It happened because one race was superior. With more money going into land and houses, more people are living in tight conditions and when they want a pet they need a small one, but say they LOVE a big dog breed. Well people make lots of money off of giving others what they want not what they can already find. I mean why not just find a naturally small breed with similar characteristics?  It is sickening but like history, will happen over and over again, but not exactly in the same way, it will differ but it will appear.  I'm sorry I can't say anything to help except that if you don't like it, don't look at it. That's the only thing that helps me feel better about horrible things in the world.  It is stupid though I must admit. :(    ADD: Also did you see this pic-http://dakotawinds.homestead.com/MiniBer...  it's the one where the mom has the puppies. SHE'S IN A CHILD'S SWIM TUB! WTF!    I wasn't saying they had the money, I'm pointing out that these people don't know how to breed dogs. It sickens me!|`|3YMETqStaa	I was just having this discussion with my roommate after seeing a Labradoodle at the park.  I am disgusted with this whole design a dog thing.  I could probably get behind an argument for a dog for an active owner that is hypo-allergenic, as goldendoodles and labradoodles are.  But crossing breeds because they look cute is terrible.  Love for a dog should be unconditional.    On another note.  These designer dog owners are just like people who get a puppy for no other reason because puppies are cute.  When that puppy loses its puppy appeal and the owners realize that they did a shitty job of training it, they just get rid of it.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	Funny this shows up now. I actually ran into this site a few years back. I was just perusing doing some research on Saints when I ran into that. I sent them a nasty e-mail. Doesn't look like I slowed them down any. "Mutts are dogs of unknown lineage." RIGHT...|`|xYsCC5UXaa	Hm.  Well. I just emailed them. Haha.  I look forward to their reply, to be honest.  If you want info on it, I'd be more than glad to supply you with their reply!!!    I'm going to go check out the first link, though. ^_^      I actually burst out laughing at their page that was the "purebred vs. mutt" thing.  And then I puked a little when I looked at their dogs.|`|MLC97M1Baa	I totally agree with you, and it is refreshing to see someone else with the same opinion as me. I am so sick of "Get the new designer breed" or "Mini this, Mini that!"    UGH. This is utterly pathetic. I feel so bad for those dogs, and it enrages me knowing that the owners will profit from these made up breeds. Wow, all I can say is this has gotten way out of hand. It reminds me of a puppy mill, that place. With a super bad breeding program.     I hate seeing breeds all F'ed up for profit and visual appeal. It makes so many people not take owning a dog seriously like they should.|`|yLwKWzIUaa	omg unless those websites are many breeders in one, they are like borderline puppymill. i totally agree. a breed is a breed for a reason. there are WAY too many mix breeds in the world (not that i'm against them i have 2) we don't need more people breeding them on purpose. people should adopt the dogs that are alive today and reduce the amount of dogs being put down.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	"It is a medical fact that Purebred dogs are prone to health problems."  They fail to mention that more mutts are due to bad breeding like theirs, and if done properly purebreds can be just as, if not more, healthy.    "There are over 300 documented genetic health defects  in dogs and in purebred dogs the incidence of defects is extremely high."  Yeah, and making mutts and not doing proper testing can just lead to a mutt with the genetic defects known to both breeds    "There are little to no health problems that are associated with crossbred dogs"  Again, no. They can very well end up with BOTH defects      Ugh people that breed these "crossbreeds" are idiots, and same with the people who bought into this disgusting trend|`|bMYv0fBHaa	Ugh. I can't believe you had the stomach to search those things---"Mini" versions of what shouldn't be mini makes me sick! Mixes aren't much better.    How do people think they SOUND? When someone walks up to them and says, "Cute dog. What breed?" and they respond, "Oh, s/he is a Cuddle."  ^^Ridiculious!    I didn't agree with the creation of the Lab X Poodle mix, but at least they had a goal in mind (even though regular Poodles can make good service dogs). It has gotten out of control.    Add: LOL. Three people in a row that said "Ugh"!  Basically sums up these losers :)    Add2: I just looked closer at the "Mini" Saints page...how they do it. They are describing how they made a dog as if they were baking a cake! Adding things in as if it will all work out, and only the desired traits achieved.|`|okdPuy1Kaa	It never ends! On Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl, they featured a dog listed as "Breed: Puggle" Uh, what BREED is a puggle?! MUTT!|`|a6an2aN0aa	Ugh, that is just revolting. I am utterly speechless at the ridiculous stupidity of these *breeders*.     "It is a medical fact that Purebred dogs are prone to health problems. These problems include, but are not limited to:    Bone &  joint disorders that cause lameness  Eye Diseases that cause blindness  Heart disease that is sudden and may cause early death,  Epilepsy/seizures  Immune system diseases  Neurological diseases  Skin diseases  Bleeding disorders  Cancers & tumors"    And, what, mutts are completely immune to those diseases? Somehow, breeding two DIFFERENT breeds meaning that you are combing the common health problems of one breed with the common health problems of another breed miraculously makes it impossible for the offspring to get them? Haven't we already learned that 1  + 1 = 2?       Pathetic. Just purely pathetic. These *people* (if you could even call them THAT!) are selfish and heartless and do not deserve to even own a dog.    UGH!!!|`|bIaywrBCaa	It is absolutely crazy but what is the craziest thing of all is that stupid people will be pulled in by the cutsey names and give bloocoodles of money for these mutts!!!|`|fgxajTiBaa	I just vomited on my computer...    No seriously, WTF! Why the HELL do people think they can do s*it like this?!?! I wish I lived near them so I could harass them day/night about their horrible unethical disgusting habit of breeding dogs that are exactly like ones in shelters! How many freaking lab beagles mixes are out there? Only like a million!    ARGH! I'm sorry....that infuriated me...Rayven you and me should write to them.

Are you aware that pouched rats take a lot of time, and effort, and that there are actually instructions on the web to DIY ARMOURED GLOVES for use with these animals.

NBfBKI1Uaa	Coral simply doesn't grow in your saltwater tank. In the ocean in take hundreds of years for few inch of hard coral.    But you had introduce coral in your tank by proergating. This is simply getting a small piece of coral from one else or and attaching it to your live rock.     Once attached, it will start growing it the right amount of calcium is provided. That is why marine marine aquarists dose calcium.    -rds|`|I08iONdaaa	Coral take hundreds of years to form sufficiently. That's why coral reefs are so vulnerable, once they die, they don't come back. I would think you need to buy it. I doubt that it would set up on it's own anyways in your fish tank (remember, coral is an animal, not a plant). The calcium carbonate structure at least would take a really long time to form even if your little corals did decide to set up shop.|`|a71583b0c26817608a80bcd66631df80aa	doesnt coral takes years and years to grow???

f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	if you mean like seeds you can throw in and grow coral then no, but you can buy small frags and grow thoes out yourself, it will be cheaper than buying whole colonies,       make sure your anemones are well established and staying still other wise you'll wake up to some really expensive coral skelletons|`|sOVc08Dsaa	It is best you buy it..

qioH81tiaa	Silly, very clever - or has very little retriever instinct, which is bad in a retriever...    Start small.  Have two of the same balls.  Give her one, and keep one.  Show her you have one, and when she comes back to you with hers, throw the other one (start throwing very short distances).  Good luck, and it's not the end of the world if she doesn't like this game.|`|0SHAY9TQaa	Haha...I own 3 dogs! My Shepherd Mix does the exact same thing. He sill stare at the ball, and is like "Well, aren't you gonna pick that up?!"    I also own a Golden Retriever! She is a true Retriever. She is an amazing girl! She runs, retrieves the ball, then drops it in my lap. Boy, I love her!    I think your dog is both silly and clever!    Good Luck and Enjoy :)|`|P7UgonvNaa	Lol. Silly. A lot of dogs do that. I think they just don't get it.|`|xLcIT9BVaa	My rott-mix does this sometimes. I think she just likes the chase more than anything. I know she knows how to fetch. She also knows how to get the toy and beat my other dog is the head with it. It's her way of getting him to join the fun.     To get our dog to chase her toys, we started by doing things like hiding them behind our backs, out of her sight. Once she got that, we started rolling the ball and she worked her way up to fetching.|`|9Y56hQRlaa	Silly.. but i woulddt be suprised if she was saying "get it yourself!" Goldens are very smart dogs.... ambye reward her whenever she attempts to play fetch like "extra normal dogs" do.... but acctually most ddogs just leave it there lol|`|AA11097657	All dogs like the chase but some don't understand what to do when the prey stops dead.    The same thing happens when we throw toys for our dogs.    I have a sheltie that did the same as yours.  I have spent many hours sitting on the floor playing raggy with a furry toy.When she is really excited and doesn't want to let go, I take it off her and throw it 2 foot. She can't help attacking it. Bringing it to you takes a little longer to teach. You have to go to them when then have picked up the toy and play at tugging. Eventually you can run backwards and they will come after you with the toy in their mouth.  They won't come if you stand still.|`|khDvD1PFaa	did she used to play fetch? it sounds as though she doesn't understand that she should bring it back to have it thrown again! :o)  when you have the ball get her very excited about it, throw it and if she shows the slightest sign of picking it up or bringing it to you, give her some form of a treat!  i would say she's being silly/playful.|`|N81XyHlLaa	hahaha...  silly  With my dog he ALWAYS catches the ball.  The only problem is that he never gives it back.|`|TplAab3Haa	Not silly, not clever.Running on instinct. Wild dogs/ wolves chase their prey and the instinct is to chase AND bring it down. When the ball or whatever stops, the instinctive urge stops. some dogs are just like that.
UPTu7uIVaa	The litter boxes are in the laundry room.  Food and water is also in there (we have a pretty big laundry room).  I also have food and water in an upstairs bedroom for them (gated off so the dog can't eat their food).  Of course, we have a 4 bedroom house and no kids yet so there is plenty of room for the cats to have their own room.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Basement.    Make sure to keep the food and litter fairly far apart.  It's inconvenient but cats don't like to poo where they eat, and if the food and litter are too close they won't use the box.  It's because in the wild, the poo would alert predators to where they are so they don't poo near the food source.  Some cats are fine with the two near each other, but some will be picky about it.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Litter box is in the basement by the washer/dryer.  We have a nice cupboard with a countertop where their food and water bowls are kept.

Which did get annoying to the neighbors.        Now I have a bloodhound and we are so terrified that he will get the bloat we do not let him exercise much before or after eating.

Labs and Goldens are always great family dogs but they require time and training like any other dog.      I would suggest another lab or a lab mix.

If you are around horses get a herding dog.  If you are water sport type people get a lab or water dog.  If you are hunters get a hunting dog.  You see my point I am sure.  A coonhound is a good dog but once it puts its nose to the ground and gets a scent it is easily distracted so it may take more patience and distraction technique to train it.  I love collies but I have horses and a little girl and I have a lot of kids that come to my house all the time and my dogs are just perfect for that.  With a little research you will be able to find the best dog for what you do in your life.

bEQn0Vrtaa	She is playing and pop corning, go in line and study pop corning. the running is her way of getting exercise. She needs to get out of the cage to run when she is a running mood. I sounds like you are dong a good job as some guinea pigs take weeks to relax that much. Let her run on the couch or on your bed with you. they love to hide under a blanket with you and run up and down your side and sneak up to your face and check in. If you teach them how to kiss, they will kiss you run away and sneak back for another kiss and dart off again, they will play this game for as much as an hour until they have to go to their home and potty. It is easy to train them to potty on a pad so they can stay with you longer if you wish. carolmoore30@yahoo.com|`|5BV5vLRFaa	It's normal.  Mine used to run in and out of a tube all the time.  It looked like she was trying to perfect how quickly she could run through the tube.  It was so cute!|`|tQN4lGKOaa	i think she is just playing cause my guineas do that also...especially when i clean their cage...they just need to vent sometimes|`|b3pRYXkUaa	that means that they are rlly happy mine do it all the time when i pick them up it means that there in a good mood and happy to be there so good job makeing happy it looks like a rodeo bull jumkping|`|8AHUuhbvaa	sounds like she's just keeping herself busy and getting used to her space.  you should get her a buddy to keep her company cuz guinea pigs are pack animals and they get lonely.
iZILLwSuaa	I adopted my kitten a couple of weeks ago and he was very active at night.  Just try to keep her out of your bedroom if you can.  We let ours in the room because it is the warmest at night and he eventually learned to sleep at night.  Although he wakes up several times, but he usually just leave us alone now.  I would suggest you keep some of the quieter toys with her and have food and water available all night.  Also, play with her before bedtime to tire her out.  Sometimes feeding a bigger meal right before bed helps them sleep too.      As for the litterbox problem, there can be several reasons.  But first clean up the accidents really well so she won't sniff there and go again.  Also keep the litter box really clean and see if that helps.  If not, maybe try to change the litter (low dust and no fragrance may be better for her).  Or if she has too much space and the litterbox is too far or out of reach then get her another box.      Hope this help and good luck with your kitten :)|`|w1necKzYaa	How old is she? I have never heard of a kitten not using the litter box and having to be trained! as for letting you sleep put her out of the room Cats are quite nocturnal|`|Ds3G8yVxaa	No, this is just because she is a baby. Keep the litter box close by at night and as she becomes use to it start to move it further away. If that doesn't work keep the litter box close to her food. Whenever she pees where she is not suppose to mist her with a spray bottle filled with water. Keep this close to your bed. I hope you have fun with your new kitten.|`|2DuEUIDkaa	I suggest keeping your kitten in a cage or box. During the day you let them out so they get used to your house. Make sure they have a bed to sleep on. I also suggest putting them up at night in a room with the door closed. They'll settle down and fall asleep.

The Nine Band Armadillo has a range in the US, and can be found in the following states.  Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, South Carlina, and Florida.  It is always possible he saw one that was a released pet.Lol but he prolly saw something else.|`|sBIUBrS9aa	They're not NATIVE there. They are found in Texas, Mexico, and South America.

w5Bdj8Kvaa	You should definitely get an American eskimo dog. They don't get too big and are excellent guard dogs. I had one before and i absolutely loved him. He learned tricks in less than 4 days and protected the family from intruders. To get more info on this breed click on the links below.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	You want an English Bull Terrier or a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. They're both amazing dogs with really unique personalities. They're excellent watchdogs, amazing with children and aren't too big.    Although they can both be quite stubborn.

SnAsZapMaa	And what, exactly, are you going to do if the dog does have cataracts?  Click http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G... then click one of the sites and use its Search tool to find [cataracts].    The corneal abrasion is worth worrying about, because you can and SHOULD do something about that.    I doubt that the cataract(s) bother your dog - scent and sound are far more important to a dog than is sight. Their  brain's vision-centre is set up to notice movement, not for the fine detail required to read words.  My cataracts bother me because reading is crucial to me and they give an effect similar to double vision when I'm reading the VDU, but my cataracts  bother my eye specialist not at all - he's only concerned about lasering-off any bleeders in my retina.  Which could be why your vet thought your dog's cataracts worth mentioning but not worth recommending any treatment for.    As for age:  A 6 year old GSD should be in the prime of his life.  The grandsire of all 3 of my current GSDs was still winning Excellents at 10 years old.  His son and daughter that I kept for breeding-on were put down at 12? with cancers. His grandchildren are aged 14 (needed no vet attention except after being bitten by her cousins, and for a closed pyometritis at age 10), 12 (needed no vet attention except for a chronic ear infection) and 9 (needed no vet attention except for a closed pyometritis at age 6).  Les P  owner of GSD_Friendly:  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|CkecSp4Uaa	If you're concerned about it then by all means seek a second opinion.  Six years old isn't that old for a German shepherd, but it isn't that young either...remember a mere 10 years ago most GSDs only lived about 8-10 years on average.  She's certainly NOT "too young" to start developing cataracts at her age.  The "light blue" reflection that you describe is most likely a thickening of the lens called nuclear sclerosis which is a normal aging change.|`|XtcSx6lLaa	Dogs can get cataracts as young as 2yrs. old.My Chinese Pug has had a cataract eye for over 4 years and he is almost 6 years old.My moms poodle has a cataract in her eye and she's 4 years old.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Yes, someone who knows what they are looking for can spot a cataract that is developing. So technically your vet could of seen some sort of indication.    but I do agree with you that you should get a second opinion. If you have any doubt about your vets diagnoses, go get another opinion. Worst thing that will happen is that the other vet will find the same thing and you made the appointment. But better safe then sorry.    6 is getting a LITTLE older for a shepherd, but not old. But she could be developing a cataract|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	yes, get a second opinion!  go to a eye specialist vet(ophthalmologist)  he will put some drops in to the eye to dilate the pupil and look all the way to the back of the eye.  corneal ulcers can happen,also cataracts can happen at an older age,starting yes 6-7-8yrs.|`|b4NcFBhraa	First of all: I LOVE GSDS! THEY'RE MY FAVORITE BREED!  Sorry :)  anyways, I'd go to another vet just in case, but that's just me. 6 is long to a dog, you never know. There's some really young kids who, you'd think would be perfectly healthy, and they get cancer, or soem sort of problem internally. But yeah, I'd (personally) go to another vet Just in case.|`|ZJ2tem3baa	Yes definitely go to a different vet, especially for the corneal abrasion.  I work at a vets office that does ophthalmology and we see tons of referrals from regular vet offices, b/c they just dont know what they are doing.  It would be like you going to your regular doctor for glasses instead of going to an ophthalmologist.  Look in the yellow pages for a normal vet that also does ophthalmology.  This will save you money instead of going straight to a boarded veterinarian opthalmologist.  Regular vets that do opthamology should have the necessary tools and tests needed to identify a cataract and they usually do a really good job.  Hope that helps, and 6 isnt too young for a cataract I would just get it checked out again.
f3n2zXG2aa	I saw something on the Animal Planet about this.  Seizures?  Something along that line.  Might call the vet tomorrow and ask.
MLC97M1Baa	No, definitly not. There are certain factors that affect the dog obviously, but I can not see any reason why.  Kudos on getting a disabled dog.|`|JXJvxhZPaa	No, blindness generally does not affect life expectancy.  My mother-in-law had a dog for ten years after it went blind!|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Do blind people live shorter lives than non-blind people? Only if they walk under a bus.    Blind dogs will need a lot of time and a lot more patience and love than a fully healthy dog. So don't enter into this without thinking it through, once you have the dog he's yours for life as you'll find it hard to re-home him if you change your mind and he'll likely end up with a needle in his vein.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	No the life expectancy is the same, they are just harder to train.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Blindness in and of itself does not affect life expectancy in a well-cared for pet dog at all.  Some diseases that can cause blindness might affect a dog's life expectancy.  But if it's just a birth defect or the result of an injury...or even the result of most disease processes...it shouldn't shorten her life at all.|`|Kxv396v4aa	I love dogs, I have a beautiful shar pei puppy and she is my best friend. I say if that is the dog you are wanting it really doesnt matter how long its expectid to live. No one can predict that in my opinion. I would say it could be a little longer than most dogs because all the other senses would be alot stronger.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Well that depends.  If they are running around unsupervised, then yes for obvious reasons.    If they are well taken care why would being blind shorten their lives?|`|oiBGMHcBaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT|`|8lQkbrF5aa	No, i dont think so... its just the same as having a dog that CAN see.... except itd just be harder to train him/her... besides their nose is just like a second set of eyes... dogs more depend on their nose than their eyes anyways...its true... its like a second set of eyes for them... Hope this helps!
70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	My cats eat the same food that yours does,except that I also feed Max Cat dry,and my cats are fine and dandy.When I was a kid,our cats lived on Meow Mix,Puss N' Boots and milk and they were fine,too.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	cats need raw food occasionally, eg chicken or turkey breast, or even game like elk or bison or chicken livers , not cooked, or any organ food.  but leaving food in bowl all day is not good as cats will just overeat and get fat and sickly. edpecially if no access to outside.  as they need to kotch or throw up and for this get grass from pet store.  hope this helps , we love cats|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Thedre are no good reasons to feed dry food      Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|xOLSU1CEaa	no.  it is bad for her to eat can food all the time,and for her teeth, dry cat food cleans there teeth and wet food it really for when there not eating or when there sick so they will gain weight.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Didn't you just ask a very similar question? No, its not good. Purina One, even if its "Special Care", is crap food. Its full of grains and by-products that your cat doesn't need. Also cats don't need access to food all day. Scheduled feedings are best. In the wild the cat only eats when it catches something, it doesn't get to snack all day. Large amounts of dry food lead to obesity in cats which can cause diabetes and early death.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	No, it's not. Purina One is a low quality cat food and there is no need to be feeding her /any/ dry food. She shouldn't be being freefed either.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Excellent raw feeding information for cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...

fIbutEBxaa	When I was your age I fell in love with a rearing stallion that I saw at an auction.  My dad said NO WAY!  Turns out he was right! (Go figure!)  I have trained and broke a few horses and now that I'm older my philosophy is, "Why have a bad horse when there are so many good ones out there?" And I know that a stallion is every girls dream but really, it's a bad idea & I really do understand how you feel.   I got my first Mustang when I was your age.  Maybe you could find a horse that needs rescueing that is in need of someone as loving as you?!|`|RloOJ43haa	No, sorry. That is not an appropriate choice for you as a first horse. In fact, it is a recipe for disaster.|`|jdf1qVtOaa	no, definitely not if he has never been ridden and you want to ride him.But if you want him purely for company and a friend, sure. If you want him for company you should have him castrated (gelded). It will make him friendlier, less likely to run away, and not jumpy and unpredictable.  Of course all of this should only be done if you have the time, the money, enough energy, and a lot of patience. You should also have experience with horses, as they can be very difficult if not dealt with properly. have you taken lessons or classes?|`|WxACyBbgaa	I just got done answering your other question,yes you should listen.Trust me docter bills r going to be a whole lot more than a trainer will cost.I couldn`t afford a trainer etheir that is why I looked for another horse,and found one that I love so much more.I am also 15,I din`t want to listen at first etheir but it is the best thing for you to do. Were not trying to be mean. you need a calmer horse for your first horse.|`|LE6Vot7Kaa	It really depends on ow much riding experience you've had. Also if you do get him you should probably geld him because stallions can be a handful. If you have a trainer who you can work with but you don't have much experience then that might make the decision easier. Also don't go for the first horse you look at! Look at some others. You never know whats out there until you look!|`|RPTwjyjIaa	I was twelve when my mom said I could have my first horse. So off we went to look at horses. The first horse we looked at was this beautiful three year old green broke gelding. He was the picture that I had in my head when I thought about what my horse would look like. I had ridden on a few rented horses and a few times on some horses that belonged to people we knew but that was the extent of my horse knowledge. Well that and a million hours of dreaming for one, and pretending I had one, and reading every horse book I could get my hands on. :) I begged my mom to let me have that horse. I was convinced I could handle him and it would be perfect. My mom suggested we see what other horses were out there. The next horse we looked at was an eight year old Appy/QH mare.  A mix of spots she was either a white horse with brown or a brown horse with white. Either way she was not what I had pictured. Also the people had left her out to pasture for a year and not ridden her. She was so fat I had to ask them if she was pregnant. Well we ended up getting her and it was the best choice by far. I grew to love that horse and had a bond with her so strong it was unbelievable. She taught me so many things and I am the rider I am today because of her. Looking back I am soooo glad we kept looking. She was, in the end, everything I dreamed a horse would be.     Keep looking, you will find the perfect horse for you and it will be everything you are looking for....even if it is not what you think.|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	the simple fact of the matter is he is a 6 year old stallion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... he has been a stallion for 6 years even if you do get him gelded the attitude will stick with him! he has had no training no nothing and you want to take this animal on? are you crazy or just silly? iv owned yearling colts and they can be handfuls enough let alone some thing that is stronger and fully developed.....for the horses sack he should go to a show or a stud home with some one that has exp and can control him.... you only 15 when i was your age my mum brought me 10-15 year old trained geldings still i didnt start to buy younger horses till i was 20 and could afford my own vet bills and doctors bills if i got hurt. please please dont do this to ur self im telling you if u buy that horse your going to be WISHING you had listened to us trust me|`|ajj7ATyAaa	Absolutely not.  An unbroke stud isn't a suitable horse for a 15 year old, no matter how much you think you've bonded with him.   I'm 25, have worked with breeding stock (including handling studs for breeding) and young horses for a reputable breeding and training stable for several years, and I still doubt I'm quite the right person to own a stud.    Stallions must be handled firmly, and fairly with the sort of tact that only somebody experienced in dealing with them can provide.|`|I8Tahe4Jaa	Well no for several reasons.    1. He's a stallion. You can't handle him at a show until you are 18. He will be unruly. He is probably too much horse for you, as you are 15 and never owned one before.    2. He is not broke. If you've never backed a horse it is not something I would recommend.    3. It's a horse, not a toy. You can't buy him then love him for a few months then grow tired of him and not give him the attention he deserves. He needs a lifelong home that will love and care for him as well as train him.|`|6GehblM3aa	NO!!!  You said yourself that you know you shouldn't get him, then don't!  Stallions are a big responsibility, bigger than a normal horse.  Where would you even keep him?  Stallions can't be kept (or shouldn't be kept) around other horses, especially mares.  Boarding stables aren't usually built to contain a stallion.  When one of my ponies was still a stallion he jumped a 4 foot fence, and he is only 13.3 hands!  Also, this horses hasn't even been ridden.  How are you going to break him and train him when you are only 15.  The horse world is tough, I know.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	What are you going to do with an untrained six year old stallion? You need to be practical. People are telling you not to get him for a reason. You aren't experienced enough to breed him and if he hasn't been broken to ride at six years old, there is a reason for that as well.|`|20ZSqeBKaa	I think not. Talk to your Mom or Dad about it.|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	Don't be depressed.  Be happy that a few of us here are trying to save your life by advising you to forget about this stallion.  You will be safer skiing down the Matterhorn.|`|7PAGYzdhaa	NOOOOO.....do not buy him . nobody is trying to be mean to u. I HATE STALLIONS!!!!!!!! they are no fun to handle, they are push and rude, and obnoxious. get something calmer like a gelding, or maybe even a goldfish!!!lol jk:)  ja-maken me blush|`|8OJZYB3Taa	No you should not get him.    1. becuase you cant show him i believe you have to be 18+ to show a stallion  2. stallions can be dangerous without the proper training and without the proper handling.|`|6JE0mcrLaa	Stallions aren't good horses to handle being only 15. Especially if he has never been ridden. Even if you love him, he may present many challenges down the road. Listen to the people around you.      Sorry :( good luck with the horse searching|`|gwyMH4NSaa	Take my advice, I wanted a dog soooooo bad, and when I met the one I have, we bonded, and I liked him a lot! I took him home, and for a year or so, we had fun. BUT, after a while, as I got older, he became a nuisance. Especially at our age, when we want to be out with our friends, or go hang out at the movies, that will hold you back because you have to care for it and feed it and all that good stuff. You will not be able to do the things you want. Especially with all the homework we get in high school. That's just my opinion though.|`|SrkoKZWuaa	No matter how much you like him Stallions are unruly and very dangerous! If you are thinking of buy a your first horse I would suggest a gelding or mare that has had some training done and that you will be able to enjoy more.|`|fydy8Zjpaa	if you really have to have him then get him castrated.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Um....look at the facts. I know what it is like to just click with a horse. I have only had it happen to me 3 times in the hundreds of horses I've been on.    He is a stallion and most show circuits don't let stallions show with anybody under 18, stallions can become unpredictable, most boarding stables do not allow stallions for obvious reasons. So unless you had him gelded, it would be a big problem    Are you planning on breaking him yourself? 6 is really old to break a horse. So after he recovers from being gelded, you have to get an experienced person to break him and train him which will take months.    You would probably be better off finding a horse in his teens that can do what you want.    Im sorry about this situation.....I know it is hard, but it isn't fair to the horse.
xz1Eqm47aa	why wouldn't you want your dog to get a chip? it is simple and quick and most don't even flinch when they get it (i work in a vet office and have placed lots in cats and dogs). and i would think the rabies titer tests and the quarantine would be more of an issue.|`|76nTvO4iaa	All that's involved in microchipping is the vet sticks a needle between his shoulders (under the skin) and puts it in.    I took my Pom to Iowa last month.  He had fun playing in the snow.    Check for pet friendly hotels where you want to go and you and your Pom should have fun.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Honestly its safe to travel anywhere really. You can now take a small dog onto the plane as a carry on. As far as worrying about the microchip, its completely painless. They insert it through a needle and the dog can barely feel it. All of my dogs have the chips. Good luck..have fun!|`|A1vdJ0huaa	Heaven.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Arizona. Beautiful scenes and hiking trails. My granddog Harold went there with his family.|`|9G03aQhsaa	Took my Golden to Lake Placid, NY a few years ago, its a total dog friendly town.  Lots of hotels there take dogs, great place, though very cold this time of year, this is a great bet for summer though.

CtoOG6vfaa	You know, tiger barbs only grow to be 3 inches. You can put  5 of them in your 10 gallon. You could put some african dwarf frogs. You can put 6 of those in your 10 gallon. And they are very interesting. You could also put like 3 chinese algae eaters. They grow up to 5.5 inches.  I'd prefer chinese algae eaters if I were you.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	The one inch rule is outdated. I think you should get a betta with some platies and one cory catfish.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Don't buy into the "one inch of fish per gallon". All fish have space requirements.     Tiger barbs need twenty gallons minimum, and should be kept in schools of at least six.|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	i personally wouldn't get tiger barbs. they get to be about 2.5 inchs and need school of 3...     the inch per gallon rule is DUMB don't use it... you can't put a 10 inch fish in a 10 gallon tank!!! or even a 5 inch fish!    try looking into these:    Dwarf Gouramis  GLOfish  hatchetfish  Balloon Molly  Swordtails      Hope I helped!!!|`|00RgkZF8aa	Don't follow the 1" per 1 gallon rule.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	Go with a trio of killifish, like A. gardneri.

BaNrweQ4aa	this is perfectly normal. my hamsters like chew their bars all the time! they have certain spots that they just chew; regardless of whatever chew toys they have :) try putting some cardboard toilet roll tubes in the cage, they can chew them - and they're great. hamsters are just weird like this. make sure you let your hamster have daily exercise, so therefore it won't be bored or stressed out too|`|UC9Wjjscaa	Yes this is normal. I had one once that chewed its way out of its cage.  I would just watch to make sure the hole does not get to big where he can get out!|`|PVCWIEznaa	yes i used to have one and she always nawed on the third bar of her cage.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	yes mine does it all the time shes sharpening her teeth but its her favourite spot|`|RWKF6XAdaa	It normal my Syrian does that all the time.|`|0OTuWHhpaa	They do it to keep their teeth in check.  The reason they do it on your cage is most likely because they prefer it for one reason or another, it probably works better.|`|xdWzrpiOaa	It's perfectly normal: there's no reason to be alarmed!  It's actually really good for her because it prevents her teeth from growing too long.  And well done for buying her lots of chew toys but to be honest they never use them.|`|bEJmwsJqaa	my hampster dose that all the time.   they do this bacause it seems like a play mate to them. be careful though.  if they do it too much there teeth may become crooked.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	So do guinea pigs--normal|`|abXMBAfMaa	i don't really know, mine does it too and i feel bad because i think that he just wants to get a different view..  it might be comfortable that way to. you never know.|`|YdJgrgvdaa	this is normal, i don't know why they do it but all of my hamsters have done it|`|6Rt9aM8daa	Too small of a cage. Here I will copy something from my question-    . The teeth can get pushed into the brain and cause brain damage or even kill them.    2. It means they are bored. Try playing with them more often, or maybe taking something that looks yummy to a different area.    3. It is not a way of grinding there teeth! The metal is too hard to grind it, so instead it results in broken and chipped teeth.        4. Different teeth lengths are dangerous.
3sB49YNnaa	You might try the Cajun Cavy Club message board    http://www.voy.com/182132/4/3332.html    I don't know how active it is but it is a place to start.    Also check with local feed stores that sell guinea pig chow.  Breeders buy it by the 50 lb bag and the feed store folks will know who does that.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Please adopt your next guinea pigs. There are thousands of lovely pigs looking for homes - you would literally be saving a life!  Buying from a breeder adds to overpopulation, causing more pigs to be put down.    Rescues often have a wide variety of pigs available - different ages, breeds etc.    Finally please adopt a pair of pigs (same sex or neutered). They are a social species and need the company of their own kind. Living alone causes them all sorts of health and welfare problems.    Try checking out criagslist, petfinder, etc. Or just look on google, or in your local phone directory, to find rescues and shelters in your area.|`|wLHjvTuBaa	i guess ask the local pet store and find out|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Your local feed and seed stores often have guinea pigs, farmers often breed them as projects for the family and they sell them at the feed and seed stores. I have found some very nice ones there.    Good luck|`|RbyK5biSaa	Adopt from the rescue shelter!  or a rescue thingy.  Try Petfinder.com  thats were i found my beautiful  guinea pig Alice|`|va8xvhthaa	www.bunnybunch.org. They have sooo many guinea pigs up for adoption. Good luck!
nRgzjejeaa	Continue to train her... if you stop she will see your weakness  dont give up... show her who is boss while being a kind owner at the same time  puppy classes are good..  when she is bad. ignore her, etc.  when she is good. praise her, give her a treat.    TRAIN TRAIN TRAIN|`|aCqSF87Raa	It's a puppy thing - my dog was totally psycho when we started. She was more interested in playing with the other pups or greeting the people than learning any tricks or commands.    Try exercising her before class, or bring her in early to let her socialize or explore. Use soft and easy to chew treats, but try to find some that have a strong odor - the pup will pay more attention to something that smells yummy.|`|O2VZL8Praa	she is just a baby.  a work in progress.  make sure you wear her out a little before you go to class.  take some time to play so that she can focus once you're there.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Just give her time. Everything is new to her. Just don't give up on her training. She will soon get used to going to classes and she will settle into the routine.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	Congratulations you have an adolescent puppy who needs more mental and physical exercise than you're currently giving her.|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	she's just an out of control puppy  after a few weeks of it she will get used to it.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	Here's what you do. Always have tasty treats in your pocket when you're around her. When you see her calm give her a treat, and say "GOOD!" in a happy voice. when she's jumping around and excitable turn your back to her, cross your arms and ignore her. She'll learn "If I want a treat I have to be calm, I don't want to be hyper, because I get the cold shoulder!". Note, not only is 18 weeks really young to start training, training of any kind take count less repetition for the command or behavior to click with the dog.|`|qS2ugtlNaa	i don't think you cant change the dogs energy|`|3iy2gFtuaa	have a little run before class so she isn't so hyper.  Also, part of the training is to get her to listen to you and settle down when instructed to do so.  Training is hard work.  Keep working and don't give up and things will get better.
IrdZKYT3aa	A females anal fin will be flared and loose, like a triangle.  A males will be spiked and tight, facing back towards the tail and tight to the body.  Female can delay the development of their embryo's for up to about 6 months, allowing them to birth fry months after males have been removed.  Most of the female you got are probably preggers, just different stages : )  Expect babies for a while, especially if any fry survive and are male.  Tails are a good way but not a sure way to sex guppies, some males can be shorter fined and dull, and the occasional female can be quite beautiful.  Best of Luck!|`|CDBRXtnLaa	well perhaps one was pregnant when you got it at the pet store maybe while it was still in its tank at the pet store there was a male in there so thats probably how also it could be a lie but i think thats the best suggestion to what had happend|`|AwJXIFDraa	If they are both female, then one of them was pregnant when you got it.|`|tiRZwBPuaa	this is a male guppy it has this and than a female wont u just have to look closly    http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Livebe6.jpg
IrdZKYT3aa	Mystery snails are fantastic breeders.  Also, check your local shops and see if they have any pest snails.  Where I work we have an infestation, sometimes people come in and ask for some to either feed puffers or as you are doing start their own breeding colony.  The tanks at work are roughly 76-80 degrees depending on the time of year, all the water quality  are kept average or normal, so ph is about 7.0-7.2 with no ammonia, nitrate and nitrite. They get fresh lettuce, zuchinni and feeder blocks daily.  Ours lay eggs on the bottom of our flat bottom ornaments, they're clear little bumps.  Best of Luck!|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Rams horn and trumpet snails and pond snails all reproduce crazy fast. They will do it all on there own without regard to Temp and PH just over feed them. Throw in lettuce for them to eat or flake food and they will do it all on there own. Good Luck|`|cB5aBE0Eaa	Mystery Snails!!!    You said you have had turtles before so I think you know that you need at least 40 gallons per turtle when they grow.|`|omDXWRwCaa	ramshorn and mts are the fastest breeders IMO
629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	As a predator, it is to the dog's advantage when hunting to smell like something other than a dog. Huskies are a very "natural" breed and as such their instincts for such typical canine behavior are strong.|`|agh18eT2aa	Ha, that's funny.  My beagle is an inside dog, but when I take her on her daily hour long walk, she likes to find dog poo to roll in. When I see her sniffing in a very serious manner, I am alert and I jerk her leash when I see her start to go down into the poop.  It's funny, and she picks certain places to do it, and other piles of poop she bypasses.  I guess one poop smells better as perfume to her than others.  Ha!  Crazy dogs........|`|1d3ldsZHaa	They roll in stuff to smell like what is in there territory. My dog rolls in random spots. i think my other dog pees in the spots!?!
FvAl3UgQaa	Do you have a close-up photo you could share?
AA10350265	Well congratulations on getting rats! They are truly the best pets.  But yes it all depends on how well you take care of them. With proper food, exercise and environment. Mine lived 5 years, but that was only one. Ive had 6 rats, they all died of old age. Some sooner than others. Most around 3-5 years. Rats get less active when they get older and they get bigger. Like they will sleep and eat more, but they will still be play full, just not as much as the youngins. I caught that you said you had an older rat? I suggest not housing all 3 together, the oldest might become dominant over the littler ones. So i would put the older one in its own cage and the little ones in 1 cage sense they are used to each other.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Pet stores say average of 3 years, but my vet says he's had rats that he looks after live until 8 or 9! So I guess as long as they're healthy anything's possible.|`|OlPBpVD9aa	about 3-5 years|`|Cj5t4vfDaa	they live up to 3 years old !|`|44kEtDvIaa	3-4 years is what you can expect, on average.|`|XeC7eEBAaa	rats can live up to 4 - 8 years|`|JhStKzRiaa	Usually pet store rats and the like survive for around 2-3 years, but the well bred rats that don't have any illnesses can survive for well over four years. The oldest rat was somewhere around 7 years old.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	well they usually live like 2-3 years old, but keep in mind its very common for rats to get to get  diseases that kill em before their time.
oHGgNlyIaa	Let them know that you are definitely responsible enough to handle the responsibility of owning a pet. Do chores around the house to prove you are responsible. Offer to help with the extra housecleaning and vacuuming. Dogs can be messy, especially before they're housebroken. Most dogs will shed. Since it is you who wants a dog, you should make the extra effort.  List the benefits of having a dog:        * The dog will help you to be responsible.      * The dog can become a companion for the whole family.      * Walking a dog can help you get more exercise.      * Dogs can sometimes be trained to perform useful tasks      * Dogs can be therapeutic, especially during sad or lonely times    Then, convince your parents that you are saving a life by adopting a shelter dog. You are saving a dog that will have been killed next week. Think about it.Let everyone 'think' about it a few days, and then try visiting a local dog shelter.    Remember, a dog will make a great friend!    Good Luck!|`|nVAhRFG6aa	OKAII I DONT NOT MEAN TO SOUND SO HARSH BUT ITS COMING OUT!!

Twice what they pay to the vet, twice as much food, the dog needs its own leash, collar, bowl etc etc etc.    Secondly what your dog needs is proper exercise and training. Substituting human interaction with another dog will not calm your other dog down more exercise WILL. What if the dog you bring into the house is low energy?    Enjoy the dog you have stop trying to talk your dad into agreeing to another set of bills and leave it at that.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	Its not so much the cost of the dog but you also need other things to consider, time and vaccinations, vet visits and food. Its a big decision, your parents have to make and you have to respect. Meybe if you don't get this dog, theres another dog in your future, things happen for a reason.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Goldfish can only be kept with Goldfish only, not with tropical fish. For a pair of Goldfish you actually need more like a 30 gallon tank so your tank is overstocked as it is.    If by "Dollar Fish" you mean "Silver Dollars" these fish get fairly large and need 55-65 gallons minimum. They're shoaling fish also.    Sorry I mis-read that - how big is this "big" tank?    Either way, Goldfish are in Goldfish only tanks. Full stop.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Well, a goldfish is a fish that will get one foot long.    Goldfish are not tropical, they are from the temperate climate zone (in China). They are sometimes kept with other types of fish, but for a number of reasons, they do best when kept only with other goldfish.    If "those dollar fish" means the fish known as Silver Dollars (as opposed to some kind of fish that costs $1.00), they also get big. They grow to about eight inches in length, which amounts to a big fish, since they are roughly disk-shaped. Silver Dollars are herbivores, which means they will eat any plants in their tank.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	you really shouldn't mix tropicals with goldfish. they eat different foods, have different temp requirements, and goldfish naturally produce more waste than tropical fish and silver dollars are sensitive to ammonia and nitrite in their water (most tropical fish are). sometimes the silver dollars can be nippy towards other fish too, sometimes. i have heard of people keeping weather or dojo loaches in with goldfish. they are cold water fish and are bottom dwellers, but i have never done this. so i don't know if it would actually work.|`|cXK9sY1raa	If your goldfish are still small - I'm talking a few inches at the most - you could keep a shoal of white cloud mountain minnows with them. They are shoaling fish and need at least 5.     However, a goldfish will eat anything that fits in its mouth, so once they grow a bit, they will try their luck with white clouds.    Best not risk it. You really can't keep anything else with them. They are coldwater fish, not tropical.    You don't say how big your tank is either. Depending on the type of goldfish you have, I'd say 30 gallons is the bare minimum you need, and for two larger goldfish I'd say around 50.
QrjjiOgTaa	ummm sure|`|u61yKsE3aa	Should be.  Most allergies are caused by an animals dander and snakes do not have dander.  That doesn't garuntee someone won't be allergic though, but I would assume it is rare.|`|QrFpYxaBaa	well no animal is really hypo allergenic, it just depends on weather the person in question is allergic to snakes. It would be very rare if you/they were....

7lsU5bcoaa	Different fillers such as plain boxes: http://rivermontfarm.com/matinee%20redon... (often as pictured with flowers)  Gate-style (can't remember the name today lol) fillers : http://www.hunterjumpernews.com/wp-conte... (this is a jump with flowers, a box and gate-thing as fillers)  Lattice : http://www.stepasidefarm.com/nike.jpg  Lots of flowers http://www.turningleaf-farm.com/Images/E...

Jumps can be very decorated : http://www.stadiumjumping.com/sj/sj_imag...  Or sometimes horses can be spooked by the color : http://www.dogbranchfarm.com/images/fors...    Get your horse used to jumping boxes and flowers as this is what you'll see. The should also be used to lattice. Sometimes in the lower divisions where the boxes are too high to go under the fence, they will place them to the side of the fence in front of the standards. (so the horse goes between them as they are jumping .This can be spooky for many horses, I don't know why, but sometimes they are afraid to jump between the boxes. You're right, hunter jumps are not very colorful, most are hunter green, navy, white etc. Pink and yellow flowers are common and there is a hunter barn around here that uses orange jumps (earth tone orange, but might be shocking to a horse whose only ever jumped dark green) Boxes are the most important thing to get them used to, since some horses are afraid to jump anything with a filler. Also some barns put decorations on top of the standards.    good luck, hope I helped|`|Czh1fbQgaa	At smaller shows, the jumps look pretty much the same. Larger shows have lots of flowers on the jumps. They are really decorative and have LOTS of plastic flowers. Some of the rails looked like white birch branches.  The jumps can be oxers, verticals, doubles, but you probably won't have bounces or really tight turns.|`|ewQDWKp0aa	The jumps can be oxers, but you probably won't have bounces or really tight turns.|`|Edg8rjTwaa	you should get your horse used to jumping over flowers... they often are there|`|QTT9380Yaa	get your horse used to:    LOTS of flowers  solid boxes  bushes  gates|`|gbd4PMwfaa	What i did to prepare for this was I had my uncle make a plank jump, it was a jump that extends downward to the ground like a wall, if that makes sense, I also took some old flower pots and fake flowers and stuck some cardboard on top of my flower pot and stuck the fake flowers in the cardboard. I covered the rest of the cardboard with easter grass and I had some decorations to school with. The smaller hunter shows I go to normally have some plants but regular standards. Hope this helps.

nlMfJtxcaa	Dogs that live on farms. Working dogs. Not pets.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	well they live at my house lol we have a Great Pyrenees who lives with our sheep, she sleeps in the barn with them and hangs out with them most of the time..we also have stumpy tail acds but they live in dog houses but work with our sheep..the Pyr likes to come in the house only for treats it gets too warm in here for her but the other ones come in when they are cold..
AA11887983	I would use lab blocks and supplement with various fresh foods.  Small amounts of certain seeds might not be bad, but not as a primary diet.|`|hdQvbs0naa	Lab blocks always.  The seed mixes can be eaten, but I would only give them seeds as treats. Seeds are very fatty and don't have all the nutrition they need. They'll just pick out what they like and leave the rest.     The best lab blocks you'll find in stores are Oxbow and Mazuri. Oxbow is better, but Mazuri is still good.     Supplement that with fresh veggies and fruits and grains.|`|cDz6jxxnaa	You should buy the normal hamster mix becuz it has everything they need and then feed them some extra fruits and veggies on the side. But not too many fruits cuz it can cause diebetes and only feed them extra stuff twice a week!!
N1YzhVRzaa	HEAT was an acronym.  HERE EVERYBODY! ANY TAKERS?|`|KH3kbRjgaa	"Heat" is a term used in zoology meaning the period or duration of sexual receptiveness. The estrous cycle (heat ) occurs in all placental mammals except humans who instead have a menstrual cycle. ?|`|00B394HBaa	Once upon a time, we humans had estrus too.  Going into 'heat' is simply the overly friendliness of the female dog, that alerts every male in the Southern Hemisphere that mating is on! Uh, with her!    Good Morning!|`|1lCUPVAkaa	Never heard it said, as going into    Just  "She's in heat." Meaning a time to be bred.|`|PM23RDycaa	Honestly I don't know. In the states its 'In heat' and for the brits is 'on heat' I never thought about that before why we often say heat rather than estrus other than its less of a mouthful.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Maybe it's because a b*tch's estrus causes a dog to be "hot" for her?     Lol?|`|eDySIDPQaa	Actually it has been called several things in the US    Going into heat, which means not there yet fully    Coming into heat which means she could heat any day...    On heat is US phrase as well, lots of show people use this term, which means, the female is ready to breed...have used it myself and others do as well...but most in US say going into heat.....    Heat cycle which means all the above, the ole gal is gonna be ready like now or very soon, LOL    And when we attended the Crufts Show 2 yrs ago, the Brits called it going into heat, never heard a brit say on heat, but one person and she was like 9 yrs old.....but hey, you can say it anyway you want, it all means the same ole thing..and it is on this year and they show begins March 2 -10, if you watch it they highlight breeders and when they talk about their females heating, you wont hear on heat, never have....|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Because during sexual arousal, the blood temperature and pressure rises like infrared steam...
Z0v6G0Kgaa	I've got a rat terrier and he's just a terrific dog.  We compete in agility.  Here are a bunch of things you could do either inside or on-leash that will push your rattie:    1.  Take a class (obedience, rally-0, agility are usually indoor if you're in a cold weather area).  2.  Do tricks work in the house.  Do a new trick every week.  I've taught my rattie to climb up and down a step-ladder, to weave between my legs, to jump into my arms as I stand straight up.  3.  Get into behavior shaping (go to www.shirleychong.com for more details on this).  You can teach your dog all sorts of wild stuff without luring, without using gestures or giving commands.  I've taught my dog to flip over a cardboard box and climb inside, to tip over a toilet paper tube and roll it in a straight line with his nose, to turn a metal bowl upside down and then stand on it, to climb into a rocking chair.  Once you get into behavior shaping, you get a dog that is continuously looking at you.  It really builds relationships and focus.  4.  Play "doggie zen."  Your dog gets what he wants when he no longer wants it (see Shirley Chong's website again for the details on the game).  Fascinating for teaching control and restraint.  5.  Do exercises within the house.  Call your dog up and down off the bed (call and up and then do a roll-over than a "off" or down off the bed).  Have your dog assume a sit-stay at the top of the stairs.  Then put a treat/small piece of kibble on each step but on opposite sides.  You dog will improve her muscle tone and conditioning as she goes down the stairs (having to shift first left, than right then left and so on).  6.  Teach your dog to distinguish between her toys.  Some of these things don't sound very physical.  But good mental stimulation will tire out your rattie and this is a breed that just eats this kind of stuff right up.    Okay, treats....  1.  I will buy Zukes mini-treats (a good size--not too big and also healthy).  I also buy the Wellness squares and Zukes powerbars (you can tear a small piece off).    2.  I like to use cheese sticks (come prepackaged, you can tear off small pieces, cheap, almost all dogs go bonkers over 'em).  Ditto with hotdogs.  Though both should be given in limited amounts and both produce either gas or runny stools (so they're not great as a daily treat in large amounts).  3.  It's very easy to make treats your dog will like using tuna (or canned salmon), some grape nuts (no, there are no grapes in grapenuts), a non-wheat/corn grain like barley, an egg, mix it all up, put it on a baking sheet, bake until hard, let it cool, cut it into small pieces and then freeze.   4.  And as much as my rattie loves hotdogs and cheesesticks, he also goes bonkers for a soccer ball, tugging or a JW squeaky ball.  So sometimes I treat with a toy or playtime or tugging.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	a walk...............|`|Umt80GyKaa	ok do that|`|KrP202Ctaa	lucky!!!! i had a rat terrier but got killed last year  now i got a new puppy pitbull i take my dog to a dog park u can let them off the leach no prob|`|QWOut9tSaa	Treats-BJ's or Cosco or Sam's sell a jar for $5.99 that lasts for months...they look like little hotdog treats but bite or two size.

UMfumO1paa	I had a rat named Baby girl that had this exact tumor. This is probably a mammory tumor. Unfortunatly the only way to get rid of these is to take them to a vet. As long as she isnt in any pain its probably not pressing on any major organs. But heed this warning, it will grow in size and eventually the rat will die. Im sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this is what happened to my little rat. The reason she is so skinny is because the tumor is taking all the nutrients out of the rat to basically feed the tumor. But even if the tumor is removed there is a chance that the tumor will return. And its a pretty high chance. For some reason females get tumors very easily. She can and will live out most of her life pretty normal. If you dont have the money to have it removed(tumor removal in a rat is extremely pricey) keep her comfortable until its her time to go. Dont be alarmed, my girls tumor ended up growing to the size of a golf ball. The reason I didnt have my girls removed was because they said she was so old(she was a month shy of 3) they were afraid that she might die on the table. So I just made her as comfortable as possible. Gave her a one level cage, put the water bottle down further for her so she didnt have to strain to reach it and when I realized she was to the end I took her in and had them help her cross the rainbow. She never was in any pain. Unfortunatly sometimes these furballs are really a labor of love. Sorry I cant be more optomistic and I hope I helped.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	Well its obvious that you should take her to the vet. Tumors don't just go away but this doesn'y mean there cancerous|`|MCMGakkNaa	You should find your nearest exotic vet. I am not a vet, but it seems like the tumor is sucking in all her nutrients to grow. It should be removed as soon as possible. Find your nearest exotic vet and talk to them about getting your rat treated. It will be expensive to get Bettercup treated, but whats more important, money or your beloved rat?
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	yes if you don't mind finding them belly up the next day. buy the correct food if you want to keep fish alive|`|avVdKiWKaa	Yes.

Xt6wsuabaa	Most dogs sold at petshops are obtained from puppy mills.  It usually always results in a poor tempered dog and other problems.  A lot of times though, a professional dog trainer can do appropriate obedience training that will help resolve, or greatly reduce any bad behaviors. The training becomes a daily routine.  Sorry Daisy had to be put down.     If you are considering getting another dog, get one from a dependable breeder, or rescue a dog from an animal shelter.  At the animal shelter, they will have observed a dog for possible behavior problems to determine whether or not they are adoptable.|`|b94588139eda1c69ea59fe863af53826aa	you put it to sleep because it was mean ?  you trained it right huh well by the sound of it you didnt do a very good job at traning. maybe you shouldnt have dogs try keeping something like a hermit crab or something that would not be dangerous to another person like some dogs can be if not in the hands of a person that knows how to rise them... you dont get a dog and put it to sleep because its hard to teach.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	that bad breeding did, thats what you get for buying a puppy mill dog, and yes this was a puppy mill dog.|`|agh18eT2aa	I don't understand why your question is urgent if your dog is dead.

THATS what comes from Pet Shops!|`|xYsCC5UXaa	this is not an "urgent" matter.  either way.  pet shops sell crap that comes from puppy mills.  puppy mills don't give a sh*te about temperament, socialization, health, and morales.  they want money.  they spare *everything* about dogs to get that money.  by selling dogs to pet shops, who in turn sell them to undereducated/unknowing impulse buyers.

MX9M36B4aa	It is just his own lil personality coming out and this is the way he plays.As long as he is not getting to rough or hurting you or any one else then i don't see the problem.:)|`|O545aSKWaa	Ok, regardless of its "playful" personality, ask yourself this question.     "When you're dog is 70lbs - 90lbs, do you still want him tackling you down and prying your arms off your face and nibbling on you?"    Of course not! There is such a thing as appropriate play behavior!     You need to begin changing this behavior as soon as possible. Nibbling is out of the question! Never allow your dog to nibble on you for any reason! When your pup does this, simply get the pup off of you and stand up and turn your back to it.     If you want to be more direct, you can always grab his muzzle and tell him "NO" then stop playing with him for a few minutes. I wouldn't recommend this just yet because you should always try the more gentler approach 1st. Secondly, I do not know if your dog is actually displaying aggressive tendencies. If that is the case then you would need to have a clearer understanding of his behavior and how you should address it. If you try to grab the muzzle of an aggressive dog, for example, and they pull away then they have won. This means that the next time they try it they'll think they're stronger than you and can potentially become more aggressive.    At any rate, try my first piece of advice. If that doesn't work, feel free to contact me. I'm more than happy to walk you through other options.

aP4bkYOCaa	It depends on what you mean by "cleaner."    Dogs can be housebroken, but don't meticulously groom themselves the way cats do.  Cats groom themselves to keep clean, but they dig around in a litter box.|`|LnHOn5JOaa	Cats keep their coat cleaner until they get old and sometimes stop grooming themselves. But dogs are way easier to give a bath to. Especially short hair dogs.|`|M6KMlzQKaa	really neither  dogg you ave to potty train  cat you have to litter train  and they both shed  you just dont have to worry about batheing cats they bathe themselfs|`|AA11125475	I'd have to say cats. The keep their grooming up while you have to give a dog a bath. Good luck trying that with a cat.  The dogs will track mud in when it's wet outside and leave bigger prints and shake the water off all over. I have one dog, two cats and I can see the differences...|`|igpMQn0kaa	Dogs can be clean, but you have to take the time to train them not to chew up stuff and potty train them.     Cats pick up the concept of the litter box right away and, while they can get into stuff (especially as kittens), they generally keep to themselves and don't cause too much trouble.    If you want a pet that will be clean without much work, get a cat.

Also try asking your parents/neighbors/relatives if they need help with chores such as mowing the lawn, washing their car, etc. Also look through your old things. If you have any items in good shape that you don't use then ask your parents to auction it on ebay.

OpBfhALOaa	Remember that the closer you are to the horse the safer you are. When you walk a foot behind a horse who kicks you're going to get a larger impact than when you are right next to their butt. In fact if you are right next to there but they are a lot less likely to kick you because they will know that you are there and will not have any room to kick you at all. When you walk behind a horse make sure to brush your hand against them so that they get that you're there. I get the whole sudden phobia thing! =) never with horses, but i volunteer at a nature center and take care of some animals, one of which is a snake.

LOL! so ridiculous of me, but I couldn't touch her for like a whole week!

It may be that you need to spend some time working with them on the ground.  Just you, them, and a halter and lead rope.  Just do simple exercises together.  And get alongside them and scratch their belly, and practice running your hand down their back legs, etc., until you begin to relax with it all.

Is the cat unwanted or you just can't afford it? There are some programs out now that can help low income people get pet food, again the ASPCA can help with that. Also, even though the food is not that great, $1 dollar stores have petfood and they can get by on it. Even sharing some of your own food with kitty, that's what I would do if I ever had to make a choice. Cheap sources of cat litter are sawdust or woodpellets.

Turn away from him, or push him away and tell him a very clear and firm 'no'.    If he stops trying to lick, tell him how clever he is and give him a treat.    Over time, if he gets a 'no' every time he tries to lick, and praise/reward when he doesn't, he will change his behaviour.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	Kick it down a flight of stairs|`|vB9VlHHkaa	change your pants, retard|`|ZsPQk9MEaa	Go take a wash|`|19a9c1720c92194802be24f06430fb7faa	Along with treats for good behavior, you can also use a little negative reinforcement aside from yelling. I would try using a spray bottle (with water) because dogs hate that. Every time he tries to lick you, spray him in the face. This will eventually reduce an unwanted behavior. It's what the experts call conditioning. I hope that it works for you in the long run. As with any training, it takes time, so be patient. :)    p.s. he's associating your pants with peanut butter...gotta get it out of his head.

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Baking soda will work at least temporarily, but the pH may go back down if the acidifying processes in your tank are stronger than the buffering capacity of the water.    A large amount of baking soda should buffer the tank to somewhere around pH 8.0, but you can use smaller amounts to raise the pH to a lesser degree.    Put in a pinch or two of plain household baking soda for each ten gallons of water, then check the pH after about an hour to see how much it has gone up. Don't try to raise the pH all the way from 6.0 to 7.0 in one jump. Instead, raise it a little bit each day until you get the pH where you want it. Continue to monitor the pH daily until you get a good feel for what's going on.|`|19iyBoD3aa	yes|`|1827d79e1a59bbeb213b8e03785ba568aa	i have never heard of using baking soda.    are you doing this for a fish tank? if so what kind of fish?|`|tDcItiATaa	baking soda is not really an approved method of increasing the PH, though it will do the job for you. But do not continue to use it on a regular basis. Good seashells will keep the PH up.    If you choose to use the baking soda, be sure to add it at small amounts, or it will stress the fish.    I have used baking soda myself on several occations, but again it is not approved.    hope this helps.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Baking soda will work, but make sure you do really need to adjust the pH. Once you start adjusting it you will have to re-adjust every water change, and you risk the pH being instable, which is a really bad thing.    Most common fish can adjust to a pH between 6 and 8, and stable is better than having it swinging wildly.    Also if your tap water is higher than 6, then more water changes will bring the pH up.    Ian|`|8owlj2xHaa	You should not really try to raise PH in a tank under 50 gallons with chemicals. What you need to do is make sure the surface of the water is well agitated, and remove any glass lids if you are using them. This will raise PH> Ph is a direct result of Alkalinity and available oxygen in the water. Try doing what I said and see if PH does not go up. Also Test PH at the end of your light cycle as this is when your PH is the highest. It is lowest in the morning right before your lights come on. If you have chronic ph problems then test your water change waters Alkalinity level. It should also be 7DKH.. If it is not this is the source of your problem. If Alk is low then raise it with baking soda and let it sit a day. Then do a water change. You will then see your ph start to stay  up if your tap water was the source of your problem.|`|yBrKP2sFaa	Liquid zeolite helps balance pH levels in the body.

About 7 on a nice sack of GOOD food, anything from Kaytee usally works good. Five or so dollars on a water bottle. Get a few chews for a dollar or two. Use a small cup from home for the food bowl and get a BIG wheel, like BIG because syrians when they get older and bigger can get hurt off the medium size wheels.

IrdZKYT3aa	You need to lower your ph fast.  Is the tanks water high or is your tap water high?  If it's the tank do a 1/4 water change, if it's your tap water a water change isn't going to help with this.  Get to a pet store and get some ph adjuster, since you know yours is really high get one that lowers it to what your fish need, usually around 7.0.  There's multiple products available but you need to do this quickly.  And what do you mean not that bad?  Any ammonia is bad, stress level reading may not be enough to kill them flat out but will make them sick and weak and eventually kill them.  A water change would help this, do a good gravel vac to help remove particulate and debris as well.  So what do you have?  Big fish?  Messy fish?    This needs to be taken into account as well for water quality issues and ph level parameters.  Some cichlids prefer a higher ph.  When's the last time you changed the filter?  Is it due for changing?  I'm a huge fan of AmmoCarb, it;s a product placed into the filter along with the original carbon.  Get AmmoCarb, not the other stuff, this one will help clear the tank as well as pull more ammonia from the water.  Also try some water clairifier to help clear the tank.  The fine particulate that often makes the water cloudy is often too small for the filter to hold, and this clumps it so the filter can grab a hold of it.  Best of Luck!|`|Lpmd9M8Iaa	Remember, most fish will thrive in a wide pH range - usually from as low as a full point below their ideal pH to a full point above the ideal. Also, different fish have different ideal pH as a base for these ranges. Some fish prefer pH as low as 5.5 and others prefer their pH to be over 8.5! Remember, before you consider messing around with the pH of the water in your aquarium, there are several questions you need to have the answers to:    What is the ideal pH for each of the types of fish I am keeping?   What is the actual pH of the water I am keeping these fish in? Not just is it high or low, but what is the value on the pH scale from 1 to 14. Just knowing that the pH is above or below 7 really doesn't tell you very much.   Is the actual pH within the range for these fish? (Chances are that unless the water causes burns when you wash with it, that it is tolerable for almost any fish you could get.)   Is there actually a reason to adjust the pH, or am I just doing it because it seems like something to do?   Am I seeing any problems with my fish? Have I ensured that I am providing the necessary care for the fish including weekly 10-15% water changes, regular necessary filter maintenance, proper diet and feeding, correct temperature, correct salinity, and healthy tank population? Chances are, if you are seeing problems, that one of these tasks is not being completed, and it is the cause of the problem, and adjusting the pH will make things worse rather than better.   Quite possibly, the worst thing you could do to your fish tank is mess with the pH with chemicals. The pH is going to be buffered naturally to whatever it is coming out of the tap, and is very difficult to adjust safely. Adding chemicals to the water will very often leave you with an unstable system, constantly fluctuating and ready to plummet or skyrocket as soon as you put anything else (your hand, a fish bag from the pet store, a decoration or some fish food...) in the water. I would strongly discourage anyone from trying to mess with the pH of their aquarium water unless they really need to and they really understand chemical titrations.    Again, most fish can tolerate a wide range of pH, different fish preferring different pH, but thriving in a wide range and tolerating a wider range.|`|hFU31zm7aa	you have WAY too meny fish in that tank and probley need a stronger filter probley if you have a gold fish in there thats your problem they tend to be VERY polluting fish.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Provide detail such as the exact water parameter and pH level so that others can help. There are could be many reasons for the cloudiness.     How long have you had the tank setup? If the tank was just setu, the cloudiness could be coming from the suspended dust and other minute particles. Give it a 24 to settle down.    If the cloudiness is sort of milky color, then it could be due to bacteria bloom. This is normal part of the cycling process.     Or it could be due to high carbonate content creating cloudiness effected by the high pH.

I think that you shouldn't spend too much money on your fish now that he's getting old. If your still concerned, go to a vet.

He will definitely eat the barbs when he gets older. And he will try to eat the cory cats. But being they have spikes on them, the frog wont be able to swallow him, and he wont be able to spit him out. So they both die.

Basically, because the tank is only 3ft long, you can't have larger more active fish, including some larger Tangs and Surgeonfish, there just isn't the lateral swimming space they need.

Xobbmd7Saa	You do not look bad. I would make sure that your leg stays nice and tight (back to no stirrup work!) Also, try not to give your horse all the rein on the release, just enough so you do not hit him in the mouth. Try to not lay on the horses neck either. You want to be up so that when he touches the ground, you are back up in your position and able to guide to the next fence.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	you look pretty good. your leg slid back a little bit though, and you don't have to throw your arms up your horse's neck that far. overall, very neat and tidy.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	actually u look great, but from that angle the only thing i see is that you back looks a little hollow:) but other wide ur seat it great your hands, everything looks great and your horse is adorable.|`|9LSZfzzxaa	I would say your lower leg has slipped back a bit and your buttocks are way to far out of the saddle, you are also laying on your horses neck.

2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	Pony Boy employs "natural horsemanship" methods as do most of the trendy trainers like, Pat Parelli, John Lyons, Monty Roberts, Clinton Anderson, Frank Bell, etc.  I've viewed some of Pony Boy's training DVD's and participated in his forum.  There  is certainly great value in his teachings for those who hope for the best with their horse.  He himself is an excellent rider, polished in his riding skills and techniques, but he focuses on teaching a horse how to understand our form of communication so that the horse will respond to what he is being asked to do.  If you study his methods, it will not be a mistake.  As he has said to those who have become aware of him and his philosophy: "Our paths crossing is not a mistake."|`|IhjFjoKDaa	Do you have a specific one of his methods in mind?    I personally think he's just a guy who can read horses well. I like him more than the showman-parelli but I feel that he is less effective for beginner horse owners than Clinton Anderson's respect training series (as a lot of people get into trouble because their horses don't respect their space).    I guess for me it all depends on what level the person is at, the horse is at, and what you're trying to do. I'm not a big Gawani fan, though.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	No....  I use the German training method!

He's not your horse. Anything can happen.    How do I know? Experience. I fell in love with a mare at my stable, and I started leasing her. I quite literally lived in her stall half the time. She was vicious to everyone but me, but I loved her so much. My parents aren't that rich, they couldn't afford to buy her, though.    Guess what happened? She colicked really badly. However, the vet told us that if he did surgery on her, she'd be fine, since she was young and strong and healthy. The owner said no, it was too much money. So now Whirlwind is dead.    Either buy Shadow or break the bond, because you don't know what'll happen.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Well talk to the owner of the horse and ask if you can buy him or at least lease him.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Can you pay extra to be the only one that rents him out.

If you have just 1 of each they may school together.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Yes, in fact they are all the same species, so they will school together.

And she was still a hellion - any time I'd leave her alone for 10 minutes, she'd chew up one of my books and then poop on it. She chewed up my Riverside edition complete works of Chaucer while I was asleep! That book cost a hundred bucks.     She was worth it, because she's the best dog I've ever had, probably a result of her innate awesome personality rather than my lax training. But ever since, I've only adopted adult dogs and only been interested in adopting adult dogs... with their puppy year behind them. They may be a little bit more difficult to train for some things (like leash pulling), but their bad behaviors? They ain't nearly so BAD.     So persevere, and get through it. But REMEMBER IT.

LGDpt4jUaa	Hamsters don't really shed or give off dandruff which is  what your dad would be allergic too. Rabbits shed alot. I had one and it lived in my room, and i was allergic but it only bothered me if i got the hair in my nose. I have a hamster now and im not allergic to him at all,  and neither is my dad and he's worse than me. I don't think it would be a problem as long as your dad didn't hold him if he is somehow allergic to hamsters.|`|lhmsAlQuaa	General information           Being steppe-prairieanimals, the common hamsters are       modest with regard to feed and need little drinking water.       Moreover, they are odourless even for delicate noses. And it is just this undemanding nature that has made of the dwarf hamsters, even more so of the golden hamsters, a most popular "toy" for children. It must, however, be emphasized that dwarf hamsters are of limited suitability for small children. It's true they may be more active during the day than the golden hamster, but they, too don't want to be woken up in the daytime just to be stroken. Furthermore, dwarf hamsters are such tiny animals that only older children dispose of the necessary fine-motor capacity to stroke these little fellows without running the risk of crushing them to death.     Social behaviour   Hungarian dwarf hamsters are shy animals by nature who over and over again scrutinize the environment closely from their hiding place to be sure that the coast is clear. They go and get their feed  la hamster, stuff it into their cheek pouches and bring it home to safety. This way of life of a "grabber" always nearest to himself has, of course, a solitary character. He doesn't want to share, but just wants to look for himself. He doesn't enjoy company. Dwarf hamsters are, however, much easier to get on with fellow species than the golden hamsters. When two unfamiliar animals meet, they first go around one another several times, sniff at each other and then continue to go peacefully their own way. This allows the pet owners to keep several peaceable nest brothers and sisters together.     Behavioural disturbances   The blowing up of the legendary chubby cheeks is a display pattern and not a behaviour disorder. Neglect, keeping the animals in ways not appropriate to their species, wrong feeding, diseases, irritation through noise and touching the animal the wrong way promote the tendency to bite and to cannibalism. Because of the latter it is important that the dams are not disturbed the first week after giving birth and the cubs should under no circumstances be touched. Otherwise it can happen that completely distraught mothers eat their cubs!    Man-Animal communication   The first step to be able to communicate is the effort to get to know as much as possible about the life of the dwarf hamsters in the open countryside. This will help to soon be able to interpret body posture, behaviour patterns, vocalization. For instance one will detect that animals with put up bottom and erected tail signal their humility. Or that they stand up straight and take up a threatening position with blown up chubby cheeks. If the pet owner feeds the dwarf hamster with a calm hand, the animal will come to trust him and become tame. He then climbs on his hand and later on the whole person with familiar smell.     Animals "talk" to their fellow species by body posture, position of the tail, facial expression, vocalization and many more. If the human being has the position of companion and substitute for fellow species, then he must try to make up a little bit for the big deficit. The easiest way to do this is to talk calmly to his pets. Just the way he would talk with other human beings. Animals are extremely capable of learning and understand very quickly what words, the tone of voice and gestures want to say.     Undesirable behaviour   With his sharp teeth the dwarf hamster can cause considerable damage. He should only be allowed to have free run in the apartment when he really has become tame and when he does not seek refuge anymore from men. He will try everywhere to gather padding for his little house and put it in his chubby cheeks: Carpet fibres, pieces of wallpaper and many more. The run-out yard is indeed very risky for the animal (accidents!). It is far better to have a large enclosure.     Mood barometer   DThe body posture of the dwarf hamster tells a lot about his state of health and his mental state. When he eats and sniffs curiously and when he assiduously cleans his pelage, then he feels well and lively. When he puts his ears back, this can mean a lot: Fear, tiredness, bad mood, aggression. When he stands up straight and blows up his chubby cheeks, then he wants to threaten and impress ennemies (also the human hand) and possibly put hem to flight. This is the time when one must leave him in peace, because otherwise he might bite. If the dwarf hamster jumps in the air, then he certainly is in a good mood and high-spirited. If the animal flinches or cleans himself suddenly and persistently, he he got a fright from something. It is important then to leave him in peace.    Psychology of animals   A nocturnal animal and active also in the twilight who feels well above all in caves and in the security of a store cupboard filled to bursting, is everything else than a cuddly toy. If the dwarf hamster is frightened and shy, he can bite like lightning. This means that it needs a lot of patience to have his t|`|sunuId5aaa	you can have yr dad take medicine.  keep the hamster in yr room, if he doesn't go in there alot.  especially if you have a dog !|`|i0B5Q2SKaa	naked hamster|`|wNfGstspaa	You should keep the hamster in your room or a room where it is not sunny, but people hang around.

wF52XMxAaa	foods and plants: see http://www.avianweb.com/toxicfoods.html    And also add PTFE.  Overheated non-stick cookware can easily kill your bird.  Smoke and fumes of any kind are bad for it.|`|O70uR8FRaa	advocado , alcohol , smoke (any nicotine ) CHOCOlate . apple seed , Onions , SaLt , some beans .     Here is a list in full - . Chocolate  Chocolate is a wonderful treat to share with human family members, but it can be harmful or fatal to your pet bird. Chocolate poisoning first affects a bird's digestive system, causing vomiting and diarrhea. As the condition progresses, the bird's central nervous system is affected, first causing seizures and eventually death. 2. Apple Seeds  Believe it or not, apples - along with other members of the rose family including cherries, peaches, apricots, and pears - contain trace amounts of Cyanide within their seeds. While the fruit of the apple is fine for your bird, be aware that in addition to the poisonous seeds, there may be pesticides present on the fruit's skin. Be sure to thoroughly cleanse and core any apple pieces that you share with your bird to avoid exposure to these toxins. 3. Avocado  The skin and pit of this popular fruit had been known to cause cardiac distress and eventual heart failure in pet bird species. Although there is some debate to the degree of toxicity of avocados, it is generally advised to adopt a "better safe than sorry" attitude toward them and keep guacomole and other avocado products as far away from pet birds as possible. 4. Onions  While the use of limited amounts of onion or garlic powders as flavorings is generally regarded as acceptable, excessive consumption of onions causes vomiting, diarrhea, and a host of other digestive problems. It has been found that prolonged exposure can lead to a blood condition called hemolytic anemia, which is followed by respiratory distress and eventual death. 5. Alcohol  Although responsible bird owners would never dream of offering their pet an alcoholic drink, there have been instances in which free roaming birds have attained alcohol poisoning through helping themselves to unattended cocktails. Alcohol depresses the organ systems of birds and can be fatal. Make sure that your bird stays safe by securing him in his cage whenever alcohol is served in your home. 6. Mushrooms  Mushrooms are a type of fungus, and have been known to cause digestive upset in companion birds. Caps and stems of some varieties can induce liver failure. 7. Tomato Leaves  Tomatoes, like potatoes and other nightshades, have a tasty fruit that is fine when used as a treat for your bird. The stems, vines, and leaves, however, are highly toxic to your pet. Make sure that any time you offer your bird a tomato treat it has been properly cleaned and sliced, with the green parts removed, so that your bird will avoid exposure to any toxins.8. Salt  While all living beings need regulated amounts of sodium in their systems, too much salt can lead to a host of health problems in birds, including excessive thirst, dehydration, kidney dysfunction, and death. Be sure to keep watch over the amount of salty foods your bird consumes. 9. Caffiene  Caffinated beverages such as soda, coffee, and tea are popular among people - but allowing your bird to indulge in these drinks can be extremely hazardous. Caffeine causes cardiac malfunction in birds, and is associated with increased heartbeat, arrhythmia, hyperactivity, and cardiac arrest. Share a healthy drink of pure fruit or vegetable juice with your bird instead - this will satisfy both your bird's tastebuds and nutritional requirements.10. Dried Beans  Cooked beans are a favorite treat of many birds, but raw, dry bean mixes can be extremely harmful to your pet. Uncooked beans contain a poison called hemaglutin which is very toxic to birds. To avoid exposure, make sure to thoroughly cook any beans that you choose to share with your bird.|`|faUbUXxpaa	lets see bleach battery acid ahh windex ,propain, hahahahaha

The neons are too small and could be eaten.|`|AA12205365	Kissing gourami are moderately aggressive fish despite their name.  As they mature they will eat the neons, and bully the dwarfs to death.  Kissing is generally a male on male shoving match.    PS- You tank is a little small for kissing gouramis.  Both in terms of size, and their need to establish a territory.|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	kissing gourami gets too big and will eat ur neons... take those out and u should be ok... they do get really big thought i believe around 10-12 inches.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	To your question, no.

U5DDwHRMaa	What if you just put the tiniest little drop into their beak, forcing them, gently of course, just a drop, enuf to get a taste of the formula cuz their still propably wanting Mom&Dad's Regurg. :) Maybe being consistant many times a day, they will sooner or later learn to accept the taste of the formula, just an idea, of all you've taught me about raising my babies, I feel a little more confident that the next time it'll be easier, so if I ran into that situation your having, that's what I'd probably try to do, can you maybe keep them still with Mom&Dad and still introduce the formula at the same time, so they'll have a taste of both, for the hope that they'll keep getting enuf nutrition. I found a formula that mine really liked, maybe try trying different formula's till you find one they might take too, all you can do is keep trying hey!, I tried: "Kaytee" "Exact" Brand, it's kind of orange'ish and more grainy/gritty after mixed, they DIDN'T take to that one, but when I tried "LaFeber's" "Instant Nutri-Start" they took to it good, it's also easier to mix, it mixes instantly with cold water, as it sits 10 mins or so, it starts to thicken, then of course you heat it, it also seems to hold the heat better. I hoped I could help for once, just an idea or 2.  Good Luck!|`|bFzu835Aaa	They don't usually eat well the first day or so when you pull to hand feed. They don't know what the syringe is, or that you're trying to give them food.  Make sure the temperature and consistency is correct and try first thing in the morning before they've been fed by their parents. Most chicks won't want to even try a syringe if they've been fed a little while ago by mom or dad.    Most breeders let the chicks stay with the parents for roughly 10 days then pull. This allows them to get a good start and keeps you from having to do overnight feedings. You can pull one or 2 at a time and let the parents continue to feed the youngest since they hatch at different times (since they're laid at different times it makes sense). Try getting the oldest 2 early in the morning (we're talking just before the sun comes up) feeding them what you can, and then trying again an hour or 2 later if you don't get much in them. They eventually get it.|`|2bZMxMitaa	They hatched right. Don't worry :)  The hen doesn't lay them all at once, so she doesn't start incubating them all at once. One egg is laid, she incubates it, another is laid and she starts to incubate that. I hope that's not confusing.  He's not a runt, just the youngest. He's going to be quiet because he's so much younger. They don't always cry for their food till they're a certain age. Don't force the babies to eat, just kind of push the formula out of the syringe and onto their beaks and see if they open their mouths. If they don't clean it off. I dunno. I've never hand fed, since I breed finches. I hope I helped. Search online! I'm sure   Google will help out!|`|LfNaScTJaa	Your birds should handle feeding the four chicks quite comfortably themselves. Just check your babies crops about one hour before dark to make sure they have been fed. Around three o'clock in the afternoon is when the parents will start to give the night time feed. If you see that one hasn't had a feed one hour before dark, that is when I would try feeding the baby. Another method is to remove the two largest babies earlier and return them to the parents once you have seen that the two smaller babies have been fed. Remove them around two o'clock. You can try to feed them yourself , but they will probably still have food in their crop at that time anyhow. Just make sure you clean off any spilt food from their beak and front. It can sometimes be a messy job.

n4pNNcGfaa	You'll need a crate that fits her.  It should be large enough for her to stand up, turn around, and lie flat out on her side and no larger.  Since you know she's going to grow, you might choose a live-stages crate that has a movable panel so you can adjust the size as she grows.  A crate is an important part of potty training.  If all goes well, and you stick with the potty training program she'll only need it for a few months.    A crate is handy to have anyway for transporting her in your car, or for confining her when she is ill, injured, or for a few days after she's spayed when you'd rather she didn't run around and damage her stitches.    Here's a good article on using a crate to housetrain a pup:  http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....    She'll need food and water bowls, a collar that fits, a leash, and some toys.  Poop bags are a definite plus, but you can use sandwich bags or plastic shopping bags in a pinch.      For grooming she'll need puppy shampoo; do not use human shampoo instead.  Puppies are messy so expect to give her a few baths.  She'll need a pin brush to take out her tangles.  Your pet store should be able to point you to the pin brushes.  Those are the ones suitable for her coat texture.  You'll need nail trimmers and a product called "quik stop."  If you accidentally clip too much while trimming her nails, they may bleed.  Quik stop stops the bleeding.  Or just take her to a groomer and let them deal with the nails.    Talk to the breeder you're getting your pup from and find out what food she is being fed there.  You should buy a bag of the same food.  A sudden change in food can cause diarrhea which can mask a more serious illness.  So at first just keep her on her old food.  If you want to change to a different brand, mix it 1 part new with 3 parts old for one week, then half and half for the next week, and finally 1 part old and 3 parts new for the third week.  After that you can feed the new food exclusively.    Be sure to take her to your own vet within 24 hours of getting her.  It is important for him to examine her and make sure she is healthy.  If a problem develops shortly after you get her, you'll want to be able to prove it if she was already sick when you got her.  Then the person who sold her to you will be responsible for vet care.  Take a poop sample with you to the vet because he'll want to examine it.    She should be about ready for her second set of puppy shots.  Take her vaccination record with you from her previous owner.  Ask your vet if she has enough vaccination to go to puppy class.  As soon as she does, enroll her in a good puppy Kindergarten class.  It is the single most important thing you can do to help her develop into a lovely, well-behaved pet.  She needs to spend some time interacting with other puppies of similar age and size.  She'll meet those in puppy class while you get some instruction in training and dealing with common puppy issues like nipping, housetraining, jumping up, coming when called, begging etc.  Your vet may be able to recommend a puppy class.|`|n4ZIrNLnaa	Another source for potty training puppies is using puppy pads...puppies like to go where they smell urine and feces and they will start to prefer that spot over any other.

M9o5WpOqaa	I am not going to tell you to go to the vet,because it's not an option for you right now,though it's in the rats best interest.My vet prescribes Baytril and Doxycycline 2X a day for approx 10 days.*If the rats are 12 weeks or younger,you might want to give them amoxicillin or tetracycline instead.The Baytril can have a negative effect on young rats under 13 weeks (it damages their developing limbs/muscles and motor skills-that's why the Dr.will sub for Baytril).The antibiotics usually run me around $28.00 and it should treat all of them.When my babies get stuffy noses and seem sick,I given them Echinacea (found at any health food store or pharmacy) and then I steam them in the bathroom:put them in a locked carrying cage,set them on the counter or closed toilet seat and run the shower/tub on scalding hot,and close the door for approx 10 minutes.Make sure they are not close enough to get burned! This steam will help alleviate some congestion in the sinuses,but if the infection has gone to stage 2 (into the lungs) then unfortunately,they don't stand much of a chance of survival due to pneumonia .I am sorry to say this,because I have lost 3 male rats due to resp.infections that started in the nose,I got them on antibiotics immediately,and overnight the infection spread to the chest and I lost them :(  I did some research just now and found a website that might help you,please check it out asap:www.thepetcenter.com  There is a link to medications that do not need a prescription from a vet,though your babies really do need a steroid of some kind.Please note that I am not medically trained in any way,but I have worked very closely with my vet and dealt with this situation more times than I care to think about.Best of luck to your little sweethearts,I will say a prayer for them!|`|44kEtDvIaa	Not much other than some holistic (natural herbs) medication.

Not sure if you'll be able to get the help you need, though.  Good luck.|`|NbvTyN7saa	Not really.  They are sick and need professional medical attention.  See if a vet will accept payment plans.  The humane society clinic. might be a place to start.|`|KeevlZnTaa	There is nothing that can be done without antibiotics. Infections must be treated with antibiotics, and only a vet can prescribe them. You really need to get the rats to a vet. It is probably less money than you think it will be. I typically pay about $50 to treat respiratory infections, and other simple illnesses.     Unfortunately without medical intervention, the rats will die. Infections eventually go into the blood stream and travel through the entire body. Respiratory infection are a horrible way to go. As they progress your rat will have difficulty breathing and his lungs will scar and he wont get enough air.
w4DIPHf1aa	Easy.....just a little work as your hand mixing salt into your water change water ahead of time..    just buy good salt like instant ocean (has all the trace elements they need) and a hydrometer to measure specific gravity. (it's cheap to buy).    and your good to go...    if your tank level goes down due to normal evaporation then just add water as salt never leaves.      enjoy that brackish tank..lots of good fish choices, some need different salt levels than others so research that first.      good luck!!!|`|07lCZh28aa	I would think you better read up on this first. Usually, brackish water is sometimes tricky. Why not just go marine?|`|ssHzAVlwaa	They are difficult to keep up. the salt water has to stay at a certain level in order to accomodate the fish. It all depends on the type of species you want to keep.
jKA8SovQaa	that's normal don't worry  i had like a panic attack when that happened  i bought a parakeet about 5 years ago  (it's still living healthy)  and it got extremely tired  eyes closed,staying in one place.  i was so scared that it was gonna die.  i called up the vet  and he said it's because  of it being in shock  it just got over tired  and tomorrow  it should be less tired  and wanting to explore the cage.  if it's not better in a  week bring   her for a check up.    so yeah go by that.|`|uIk9MAnDaa	just tired get a blanket and cover them at night|`|zRXkkh0Maa	maybe its stress and tired that it decided to rest.

1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Yes she will still go upstairs with you however it's recommended no running or jumping for 5-7 days after being spayed.  Your dog will be groggy for up to 24 hours due to the sedation used in surgery.  You'll want to give her a very little bit of food and water the night you take her home.  You'll need to check her incision site daily for 5-7 days for anything abnormal.  It's recommended that dogs that have been spayed cut back on their food some because their bodies will require less calories.  They will no longer have a reproductive system and the calories needed previously for that will only cause your dog to gain excess weight.  When dealing with weight in a dog you always want to make sure your dog looks like it has a waist from the viewpoint of standing above your dog.  If you look at your dog and their waist caves inward after their ribcage then you're dog has a waist...which is good.  But if there is no noticeable difference from the ribcage to their hips then your dog needs to lose weight.  your dog won't think you are abandoning her.  Dogs are very resilient animals.  As long as you don't fuss over leaving her there she will be fine.  If you are a worried mommy then have the Vet call you after she wakes up after surgery and as soon as she's able to go home.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	she won't think you're abandoning her, she won't remember most of when she is at the vet because she will be under anesthesia. so instead of 6 hours, it would be like 1 hour.    she might be a little moody and sleepy after surgery, because her body is trying recover, give her 2 days. she'll be a lot better.    she might gain a few pounds like 1 or 2, nothing major. but know exercise is more important than before because it is easier for her to gain weight.    your friend might not have not been exercising her dog as often as she should, like I said, exercise is key now, more than before. Exercise is more than physical exercise, its mentally stimulating.    Of course she will climb stairs, all that has changed about her is that she has less hormones, and lost her ability to give birth.|`|gjD8pndjaa	1. She might miss you during surgery, but its unhealthy for a dog to become to dependant on you like that.  Start practicing if you're concerned about seperation anxiety, with crate training and leaving her with  afriend for a while.  Most dogs are fine, though    2.  She will be drugged out    3..  She shouldn't gain any weight.  Your dog will only gain as much weight as you let them.  With proper diet and exercise, there shouldn't be a difference|`|GzCC53lgaa	your dog will probably gain some weight but not much. she will be fine within a few days after and soon back to normal. dont worry so much because she will be fine!|`|NbvTyN7saa	Having an animal spayed will not dramatically effect their weight.  It can change to some extent but not nearly as much as what happened to your friend's dog.  Something else happened as well.    She will be fine after the surgery and will be a bit sore for a day or two but will bounce back pretty fast.  It is best that they don't get up and down off of couches for a couple of days.      Explain that she is going in for surgery and you will be back for her.  She might be a bit concerned but it won't scar her for life as she will just be away for you for a day or so.    She will be your same old dog within a few days.  Your vet will go over post op care with you when you go to pick her up.  If not, make sure that they do.|`|Bw18seFqaa	1.  She will be asleep most of the time she is at the vets..  besides she will realize that you come back to get her.    2.  She will be groggy and a little sore.. she may sleep for a day or so when you bring her home.    3.  Dogs gain weight because owners over feed and do not exercize them enough..  the spay itself is not what causes dogs to become fat and lazy.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Spaying or neutering will keep your dog from getting pregnant or impregnating another dog.

The next day, she was back to normal!    3.Will she gain weight? and how much? None. My Bella didn't gain any weight.    Will she still go upstairs with me? For the first day, I keep bella inclosed in my living room (on the 1st floor) so she didn't have to go up the steps. As said, the 2nd day she was back to normal!    Your vet can answer any more questions you have.    Good Luck!|`|iWo1JiBRaa	um.. did someone say "explain to her" that she's going in for surgery?????|`|v2ddVSy7aa	Well, getting her fixed is a good idea unless you want "unexpected" puppies or her going in to heat 2x a year for about 30 days.    No, i don't think she will think you are abandoning her. As long as you are a good owner & ALWAYS pay attention & love your dog she will know it is for the best & it will only be a couple hours.    After surgery varies on what her routine is. yes she is going to be in pain the first week or so but as soon as she is done recovering return to ALL her daily activities.    It really not the surgery that makes dogs gain weight. It's the owner if you walk/run/play with her regularly & don't over feed her than she should be fine.    Other than that just give her LOVE & your dog is & will always be your best friend|`|8MhJ6O9Iaa	1. Dogs are resilient. She will only be gone from you for up to a day. Most vets will keep them overnight to make sure that they are okay. If you don't want her to stay overnight, check with your vet before you commit to using that vet. Remember, it is invasive surgery and it usually a good idea for them to watch them overnight.    2. After surgery, they are usually up and around in a day or two. You can ask for pain meds that will keep her out of pain for the initial first few days. They will ask you to keep her walked on a leash, confined movement and watch the stitches very closely for infection. If you follow the vets advice, you will do well.    3. Weight gain can occur. However, most young dogs are active and don't have too many issues. If you see that she is gaining weight, you can switch to a weight maintenance food.    The best thing to help her during recovery is to follow the vets instructions. They heal very quickly. If they do get an infection, antibiotics will likely be prescribed after they are sure that the sutures are still in place.     She most likely will not be going upstairs for a while as the incision and the layers that are cut will have to heal before she is to be jumping and romping. Again, this is a very short time in her life for healing and it will benefit you and her in many ways in the future.     Good luck and keep on loving your pet. Spay/neuter is the way to go.

2284892d397da9e7d9297a73b92bd630aa	The first items you need are food, dishes for food and water, and a bed or blanket for her to sleep on. These are the first items I started with when I brought home my little rottie:) If you will be crate training you will of course need a crate. If you want to limit the rooms of the house she will have access to baby gates for the doorways will be needed. A toy or two to start with. Pee pads are handy with potty training as well. Then you can buy other items as needed: a stiff bristled brush, puppy shampoo, treats, more toys. As far as what to do with your house to get ready? Just make sure anything and everything that puppy can chew on or swallow are put up and away from her reach, i.e. remote controls, shoes, wires, money, you'll get the idea. Be prepared for a puppy that eats a lot, pees a lot and grows quickly into a much bigger puppy! My rottie is 4 1/2 months now and 50 lbs., she is cutting her canines and chewing on her toys and loves to crunch ice cubes. She is crazy strong and can pull me down the block when she wants to and at 50 lbs. she plays hard and knocks things around and sometimes steps on my feet, ouch.

PM23RDycaa	I think the real problem is that you are mad at your husband and yourself for the situation you are in. You married quick and now you have a baby on the way. The dog is easier to hate than to be mad at the people responsible for the situation.    Find an unbiased third party, clergy, your doctor, a therapist to talk to. Unless your husband is outright ignoring you, which you don't say your anger is misdirected.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	LOL its time for that baby get out of you girlfriend, your horns are showing   Have you discussed this with him? If not you need to.  You do need to make a plan for the baby and dog to coexist. Or you will have real issues.    I am just hoping you will feel better once you have your baby.Congrats on the new addition.|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Im guessing its your horomones, but Im not sure I like that dog either!  Is the dog mean or somthing? Somtimes its  hard to get used to pets we dont know often. Sorry I cant be of much help.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Hormones sweety. Hormones. Calm down and relax.     Congrats on the baby :)|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Hormones could be playing a part of it, but honestly it sounds like you have issues that could use some professional help.  Your resentment sounds very irrational (I mean, my older dog is at least 10 years old, possibly older, and I still call her a "puppy," it's a term of endearment).|`|EeJMITyCaa	Its probably mostly your hormones but having a disobident dog isn't helping. If I were you I'd tell him to send the dog to one of those training camps where you sendyour dog off for a few weeks and when you go get it it is trained perfectly and then they teach you how to control it and sometimes how to train dog further.

kHeXKtKraa	Yes, yes and a hundred times yes!  The only thing that you can't give your bird is avacado.  Of course alcohol and caffiene (including chocolate) is a no-no for a pet, but pretty much anything you eat is OK for your companion bird.  And the fact that she is trying to eat them off your plate tells me that she is a part of your everyday life at 6 weeks old.  The more variety she gets in her diet now, the better able you will be to introduce new foods to her as she gets older.  I use a little common sense though and I don't feed my birds anything with a lot of chemicals, like diet foods.  Just doesn't seem right.  As she gets older, you can hide a special food (like a blueberry) in a paper wrapper and let her open it for a little fun.  Like opening a candy wrapper.  I like to hide things in their cages for times when I will be gone longer than usual to give them somehting to do.  Another thing that my birds LOVE is a chunk of pomegranate.  Some of them make a huge mess though - very funny!  And hot peppers are an unbeliebable favorite for birds - with the seeds.  Have fun feeding your baby, don't let her eat ONLY one food, and just never give avacado in any amount.  And of course lots of sugar or high salt food is not good either.  If you don't think she likes fresh carrots, try steaming them in the microwave and mashing them.  My birds actually GULP mashed vegetables|`|eRKIfrVfaa	My dad Owns one it can eat it if it is at the age where can already fly, I have had mine a few months oh you can teach it to fly to you.

I was like "baby lovebird? what kinda pet name is that"|`|LbGRsCTKaa	They're fine for her.   Our parakeet used to eat cooked pasta and anything that was on our plates.  She lived for a long time.    Fruit is fine.|`|p6PZIQNXaa	Not yet you might want to hold that off for a while its too small|`|44dC9mdTaa	no|`|6izMqiBVaa	half a bluberry would be healthy for her|`|MjUentmjaa	yes|`|PfOBtpUdaa	No,I would not risk him getting sick,or dying.|`|OYFu9Jrmaa	if you want to stick to the safe side,no. otherwise, google it. i think it should be fine, but better to check anyway
8i90ov0Gaa	Probably not. A ball python sitting in it's water and not eating are by no means an indicator of a snake being gravid (pregnant). Yours is almost certainly too young to be mature. Have you actually seen them mating? My males will mate with the females for such a long period of time there's no way I couldn't notice it. Sitting in the water is usually a sign of an impending shed, mites, or temperatures which are too high, but not a sign of being gravid. Now if you see her with the back end of her body laying upside down, then it's gravid, but I highly doubt yours is.|`|b1sB4fuGaa	a pregnant snake.... that sounds like an interesting thing to look at.
NbvTyN7saa	Cats are notorious for hiding illnesses and pain.  You should get it to the vets.  It can be any number of serious or benign things.  We can't tell as we can't see him or get his vitals.|`|PGJKLZCVaa	You know, my cat had a bump on his back not long ago. And he is an outside cat. Well we live in the country. I was very worried about it. I called around and got the response he could have gotten bitten by a snake, we got a special needle from a hunting store and they poked his bump. It hurt him real bad =( and it was sad, but it drained and went away!|`|vB9VlHHkaa	this sounds like it could be a small cyst. they are usually harmless and the vet can do some tests if you like to make sure it's not cancer. just watch and if the furry feline acts a little sick or you see him messing with it or continues to grow, seek attention. i think he should be ok though.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	The burn point of paper is over 400 degrees, no where near the heat a heat pad can get to.  No worries.  Also, the pad is meant to be UNDER the tank, not on the side.  They don't do much for making it warmer on the side.  The issue is they need to be regulated because they DO get over 100 degrees.  This is too hot for a corn, so before you install it, get a digital thermometer and a thermostat or dimmer so you can turn down the heat.|`|CdRlOsnyaa	it is possible for the paper towel to heat up a lot idon'tt think it will catch fire but it might get really hot|`|nmzpdvkqaa	no it shouldnt catch the paper towls on fire but they will get hot. you should really put the heat pad under the tank so your snake can get the right amount of belly heat. belly heat is more important then over head heat and your snake will be able to digest his food better.|`|Fzpy5tpJaa	no it will not burn it but u should put the pad under the tank
rDLTnjRyaa	Why didn't your dad take the dog to the vet? He wouldn't hesitate to take you to the hospital if you had a severe injury(like a broken bone). That little dog might have a broken bone. Smaller dogs are injured more easily because their bones are more fragile. Don't pull on her leg because that might complicate matters. He needs to take her to the vet. That is all part of being a responsible pet owner. I understand how much this upsets you. Please provide updates. For now, get your dog settled down. Don't allow her to put weight on that leg. Get a small bag of veggies out of the freezer, wrap it in a towel, and place it on her leg. Don't leave it there for too long. This will help reduce the swelling. After the swelling goes down, find out if she will put any weight on the leg. If she yelps and holds it up, then she needs medical care.|`|gTXUcd1maa	It's probably broken! Doesn't your dad see she's limping? Take her to the vet. It will be permanently injured if it isn't taken care of. Good luck|`|5ppj90aFaa	You should take her to the vet if you can. You never know what could be wrong and it is most likely very painful for her. Try to find a vet clinic that will accept payments if that is the trouble. Please get her in to a vet if you don't want your "lil baby" to be in this much pain!!|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You or your parents have got to take her to the Vet ASAP.  If her legs are allowed to heal wrong, if they heal at all, then she's going to have nothing but problems.  Being a responsible pet owner, your father should take care of the problem he may have created.|`|jChr0udLaa	Please don't pull on her leg! Very gently try to feel the leg and see if anything is broken. If there is she has to go to the vet. If not just watch her for a day or two once it feels better she may start walking on it again.|`|btUJJfu3aa	Take her to the vet immediately.  Figure out  a ride situation.  Just because she can't talk,  doesn't mean she'll be okay.  I'm sure you can also get a taxi, and go to a vet nearby.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	sorry but a vet & probably a X-ray is your only option.  To not treat a pet that is known to be injured is considered animal cruelty in every state. Take to a vet - call around for the cheapest.|`|062cfd9edb812ebceaa817bc46b024eaaa	I would wait a couple days to see if it gets better or worse. It's no use taking her in right away unless she looks like she is in terrible pain then of course take her in. It could just be bruised. Take her in if it's not improving in a couple days. If I were wealthy I would take her in for anything I wanted, but I'm not. If you are in the same situation as me then you probably don't want to spend a lot of money to find out she just got a little owie.|`|OxetY7C4aa	it's most likely a broken leg. if she cant be taken to a vet then you need to get something strait and raped tight to prevent her from moving it to much. she will most likely have a limp. not much you can do about that.|`|fDVUbzv2aa	how old are you. BRING THAT DOG TO THE VET YOURSELF! I don't mean to be negative but that's serious And tell that dad of yours that he is responsible and he WILL pay. (in cash) he should NOT have any pets if he has that attitude or children for that matter!
NbvTyN7saa	Check with your local cat association.  They will have access for all the breeders in your area.  You don't state where you live.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Here's a list of Brit breeders.  Good luck in finding your kitty.    http://www.breedlist.com/british-sh-bree...
66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	Do not separate the puppies from their mom before they're 8 weeks old.|`|PM23RDycaa	Ok first off if you are going to take one take them all and the mom. They need to be with her and their siblings til 8 weeks of age. By 6-7 weeks they will be fully weaned but they still need to learn dog manners from their mother and interact. IF you can't handle this call your local ASPCA/animal control. I would do the second simply because at the moment I can't afford to take in a mom and pups.    ADD: OR you kick your aunt in the butt and get her to start feeding mom properly.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	In this situation I would just like talk to her about the condition of the dogs nicely and see what kind of reaction I would get, then suggest a vet trip or a call the animal control. If you take a pup even though everyone here will get mad when I say this , just make sure it can eat on its own, mushy food and drink on its own as puppies can dehydrate very quickly..we have a dog that often weans her pups at 3 wks and we just supplement them with puppy milk bought at the vet clinic..but make sure that if you do take a puppy you never let it live badly again.  Best of Luck to You and the doggies..remember by calling animal control you are giving them all at chance at a better life, and they deserve that.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Mama dog and puppies need to go to the vet.  I would hint around and see what reaction you get. She might just surprise you and want the help.|`|gTXUcd1maa	The mother dog needs to be taken to the vet immediately. Keeping a dog that skinny is pretty dangerous. As for the babies they need a sable mother. Just take all of them to the vet. :] Good luck!|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Definitely call animal control/humane society.  That way you don't cause any family arguments but the problem will be solved.    I'm sure the real owner of the dog would rather see her go to a totally new environment than continue to be neglected.    The animal control folk are best placed to take care of this problem for you - they're the experts and have the facilities to care for her and her pups.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	No you should def Take all the dogs and find the puppies New Homes. Just come right up ,and say Hey do you mind if i take the Dogs, because you really don't know that much about them,and i'll take good care of em. Then find someone to take the puppies. YES take the dog's. No it's not wrong to take her since she belongs to a totally different person.- he shouldnt have got locked up to begin with. If she refuses tell her Well i may need to get the Police involved then, because theese dog's are Really unhealthy,and the Pitt dosnt belong to you!!! she will most likley Give them up then,and Well if she dosnt CALL THE ANIMAL SHELTER. they will take the dogs then you can go Adopt them. thats what i whould Do. Even if she is your Aunt there is a limit. I mean if you can see the bones in her Tail for gods sake something has to be done, and with puppies i'd say she will die in the next few Day's.|`|vB9VlHHkaa	make an anonymous phone call to animal control. the dogs will be taken away and they will never know it was you,|`|5ppj90aFaa	You should contact your local Humane Society. Owning an animal and neglecting it like that is inhumane and unfair. If you are able to help her with the puppies then please do- let her know that you want to help not only her, but the dogs as well. The mother should be well nourished and spayed as soon as possible. Please don't let them suffer any longer. ;)|`|jChr0udLaa	call animal control right now. You can not take a puppy from it's mother before she weans them it will cause her alot more stress and damage her health more. I understand you want a puppy but if you know of a dog in distress and do nothing about it I do not think you are ready to be a responsible pet owner.
bXRFOOGJaa	If you're looking for a typical bird found in a pet store, go for a  cockatiel. A conure is also a chatty bird, but it might be too vocal  for you.  If you want a bird with a more developed learning ability, find a parrot  breeder but do keep in mind that they will be very costly.  Good Luck!|`|vMByDy1raa	I would pick a cockteil out of that brunch but you haven't included my favorite a Hans Macaw. They talk fairly clear.  Medium small bird and very social.  Mine started talking at 4 months.  I heard African Grey talk about 8 months.  I never had a cockateil.  I think they talk in a really high pitch voice.  They are very sweet though.  A sun conjure I never heard it talk but I believe they also talk in a real high pitch voice.  You need to research how much time each of these birds and cage size are different for each one.  THe perches and toys will also have to fit the bird you decide on.|`|uPri5JEpaa	a parrot is a good talking bird|`|cp4qVW00aa	A Parrot xD|`|uIk9MAnDaa	parakeet|`|2bZMxMitaa	Cockatiels whistle. Parakeets take ages to learn, but if you try really hard they can. I'm not sure about conures. Just make sure you start out with small one syllable words. Like "Hi!" :) Also, African Grey parrots are the BEST talkers out there.|`|2pmYyhgOaa	African greys are the best talking parrots. Either the Congo african grey or the timneh african grey. The difference is that the Congo is a little bit bigger.|`|JZRPuhspaa	Cockatiels talk relatively well.  The way they talk resembles a whistle, but you can understand them.  But, then again you could end up with a mumbler.  Alexandrine parakeets are great talkers as well as the breeds of african grey.  My moustache parakeet mumbles and sounds like she's always in a bad mood- it's funny.  The pionus breeds can talk a bit better than my moustache parakeet and better than a conure (at least in my experience, although squeaky my dad's sun conure has a great vocabulary and is decently easy to understand.)    The birds will talk based on how much of your time you spend working with them, but don't expect a bird to talk at all.  In fact, some just don't like to at all and it could be any breed.  If you really must have a talker- find a bird being rehomed on craigslist.org near you.      Again- there is no guarantee a bird will talk, but it depends on how much time you can devote to the bird.|`|O5mp1oMUaa	Please don't get a bird just because you want it to talk. its not a show piece. they are a lot of work and are expensive. and you may be disappointed because the amount the bird talks and how well varies from bird to bird. you have to spend a lot of time with it. its kinda like having a baby stuck in "the terrible twos" for 15+ years. just make sure you do your research and are prepared.    But anyways....    my personal favorite is the Quaker.  they are on the top 10 talking birds. and they are very reasonably priced compared to a lot of other parrots.    Hope that helps! good luck!  =]|`|808179c0ca2fbd5aff003beb3f69e364aa	cockatiels and parakeets are very hard to get to talk. african gray parretts are the best birds. cockatoos are great too

cIuHgdFWaa	You need to know as much as you can about guinea pigs.  Make sure they have fresh water every 1-2 days.  Fresh food no less than twice a week.  They love fruits and veggies but not all can be given to them.  They should be about at and average of 30 minutes a day.  Dont hold them for the first week or so you get them.  Let them get use to you slowly.  They love timothy hay.  Uhmm thats about all i can think of :) hope it helps|`|swJuTXcSaa	Get it a partner then a bigger cage|`|J7o7FtZdaa	Give it love and attention buy them chew toys so they have something to nibble on and they love timothy hay. I think a good name would be coco or panda.|`|4M3fHMciaa	Go here:  http://www.guinealynx.info/healthycavy.h...    good luck ^_^|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Firstly, you need to get at least a pair of guinea pigs, not just one. They are a social species and need the company of their own kind, living alone causes a variety of health and welfare problems - even reduced lifespan! You can have two boys together, two girls together, or one girl with one NEUTERED boy. (If you are new to piggies I would suggest a pair of girls).    Second - please adopt, don't buy.  There are thousands of guinea pigs looking for homes - adopting them literally saves lives! If you buy from a breeder or petstore you encourage more irresponsible breeding, overpopulation gets worse and yet more pets are euthanased! Check out your local rescues and shelter, petfinder, or craigslist.    To keep your pigs happy and healthy they need:    Lots of space (at least 7.5 sq feet) C+C cages are the best, and usually much cheaper than store bought cages.    Safe bedding. Pine and cedar are toxic - use aspen or carefresh.    Proper diet. Unlimited grass hay (eg timothy) at all times. Quality pellets daily (Oxbow or Kleenmama's). A variety of fresh veggies daily. Fresh, clean water in a bottle.     At least one hidey (eg an igloo) per pig, plus some toys (eg tunnels to run through, cuddle cups etc).    To have their nails clipped regularly, and to be taken to a vet if they ever get sick or injured.    Floor time out of their cage to explore and play. Do NOT give wheels or balls as pigs are not very flexible and can break their backs!    For all the info you could need check out these sites:  http://www.guineapigcages.com/ (Read all the sticky threads in the forum!)  http://www.guinealynx.info/  http://www.cavyspirit.com/  http://www.kmshayloft.com/  http://www.oxbowanimalhealth.com/|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	guinea  pigs need lots of love and attention, but for all the love and attention you give them they give it back and some. They need you to spend a lot of time each day with them, to hold them love them teach them about running for exercise and cuddling. I taught all of mine to kiss and they love to kiss you. On line you will learn about the food they need but they do not talk a lot about the amount of love that you need to give them every day, i am not talking of 20 or 30 minutes either i am talking hours. The time you spend with them is very important for their physical health as with guinea pigs the physical and emotional health go hand in hand|`|Y6k0Gyoaaa	Give it a large cage, mostly long so it can run    they love IGLOOS! get it a huge igloo it will love it!      they love eating TIMOTHY HAY !    they love to be loved! so pet them often!    they adore change of scenery, so move them around often or walk with them around hte house    they love to eat CARROTS or LETTUCE|`|tQN4lGKOaa	first of all build a cage for your guinea don't buy one...they need lots of room..next get online and look up all the info you can to help you in taking care of your guinea..i know i did and still do...as far as names i have 2 guineas so i named them ren and stimpy...love the cartoon...how about jasmin or dolly or just wait till you watch your guinea for awhile and a name may come to you...hope this helps

EeJMITyCaa	No dogs should be peeing that much!!! GEEZ!!! He needs to go to a good vet who will figure out the problem. Once you figure out the problem you may want to get a professional dog trainer.|`|HKoo2PfYaa	I have gone through this many times and I know it is not easy!  I feel your pain.    Ive got a couple of points...First sectioning the dog off somewhere in the house keeps you out of that part of your house. The bad part of this is that it may become very hard to break if you continue to keep this habit up. Crate training affords the dog a place of his own that does not interfear with your home or style of living. We had gates at the kitchen, front door entry, stairs, etc.. It got very old climbing over gates and the dog basically figured out he ruled the part of house he was confined too. Second, its MUCH easier to keep a schedule with a dog in crate training, you dictate when its time to go outside, when its time for bed, etc.. you have far better control over the dog entirely when you crate train. The dog will then start to let you know when he needs to go outside by being vocal,whining, etc. and you can begin the training that way. Believe me this sounds difficult but Ive been through sectioning off areas of the house and its no fun nor does the dog learn anything in the end.     Hope this helped a bit and good luck with your pee problems!|`|clb9NAMPaa	A PUPPY'S BLADDER IS ALWAYS GONNA BE A LITTLE INCONTROLABLE, UNFORTUNATELY ITS YOUR RESPONSABILITY TO SUPERVISE HIM AND TRY TO AVOID THESE ACCIDENTS FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Young puppies don't mark. Marking is something that male dogs do starting at sexual maturity. If your dog is not housetrained, get a dog crate and crate the dog when you are not keeping an eye on him. Take him outside at the same times every single day and praise him when he potties in the correct spot. Don't let a dog who is not housebroken roam your home unsupervised. He won't get housebroken if he keeps having accidents. Crates prevent accidents.|`|ZCeZ6hNJaa	How big or small is your pup? Smaller breeds pee more often due to their size, but 5 x in 15 min. is over the top. You need to seek medical attention. The pup may have a bladder infection, parasite or other infection. Depending on the size, keep them leashed around you as much as possible and have puppy pads on hand in case of emergencies!|`|rUMlDAINaa	Give him water at specific times, then take him outside, tell him to "Go Hurry" (or whatever your command is for him to potty), and as soon as he's done his business, PRAISE generously - make the little fella think that peeing outside, and on command, is the freakin' greatest thing ever.    Don't give young puppies water after 7 pm - it will only fill up their bladders overnight, making them uncomfortable and keeping you from getting any rest.    Stick to a schedule - both for water and for going outside to "Hurry."    THOROUGHLY clean the area where he has peed inside - he may be returning to places where he peed before because he can still smell his scent (or even old, dried urine from past animal guests).    If you notice that his urine is dark yellow and pungent, you may want to get him examined at the vet's. He could have a kidney infection.    Two things that are helpful - check out the sources box.

They are fine, leopard geckos can have different personalities.|`|McjaM0hDaa	i just got 2 geckos too, and no its not a concern. they must feel safe in the spots they are at, so leave them alone and when they get use to the new things you have put them in they will feel safe and get more active, good luck|`|u61yKsE3aa	First heat rocks are really bad for leopard geckos I would pitch the rock and get and infrared bulb instead.      To clean the cage you can use a beach solution you can use 10% bleach.   you can also use vinigar and a razor blade if the cage is really dirt.  The acid in the viniger is great for things like hard water stains.  They prolly do have differant personalities the one might hide more cuz hes shy lol but you wont see anything until they are in a good setup.|`|Fzpy5tpJaa	to clean the glass i use on my leopard gecko is i use a spray bottle and paper towels, and no it isn't weird but u shouldn't use a rock because it will burn the gecko use a red nighttime light lamp instead
tPGxPDvBaa	if you can remember his weight at 4mo then double it to get adult.  This is fairly accurate.  No the pup weight depends on his lineage not just the dam & sire.  Often dogs will grandparents or other lines with large relatives or small ones.  I guessing your pup is going to be more than  11lb & more like 13-15lb instead.|`|gjD8pndjaa	No, theres no guarantee.  Its just a guess, and it can be way off.  Sounds like your boy will be around his dads size|`|clb9NAMPaa	Its always a good assumption but every dog has it's own growth pattern, i have a boxer his parents where about 60 lbs. and he is only 45 lbs. at 3 years old.|`|Bw18seFqaa	that does not always hold true, no..  it depends on what size dogs are in the pedigree as well.    I know a 15 pd dog that came from parents that were both under 10 pds.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Nope. Its just a guide line. Are all humans between their parents weights?|`|velIdcbNaa	No.  My grandmas dog got its grandfathers genes and it outweighs his parents.  It depends on the breed it is.|`|fDVUbzv2aa	it may be between 8 and 11 pounds not able to tell now|`|87LKth47aa	?No?  Because: your dog could EAT ?more? or ?less? than what its mom and dad ate.  Or the mom or dad could EAT ?more? or ?less? than what its pups eat.|`|MVnqE8wQaa	no, its weight will be however much you feed him|`|lhOd2hvXaa	No, that is not true.  Genetics are far more complicated than the law of averages.     Sorry there is no better answer.  Your dogs adult weight will probably be somewhere in the average range for rat terriers.
pEOkDa1Kaa	Japanese usually have dogs and cats as their pets.  I think huge animals are not appropriate for limited small houses in Japan.  You can easily find the shops, hotels, vets and pet sitters for your pets in big cities.  I think your pet will be needed to have many tests in the airport to enter Japan, though.
JpH6FAlBaa	mail your coat to peta..they can use it in some weird ritual or something|`|72GOhb9eaa	Since you already bought the jacket and it is your favorite, I would just keep it. Fur isn't that bad. I understand they kill the animal for it and all,      but when you eat meat, they killed an animal for that. When you buy a car with leather in it, they killed an animal for that. People always seem to be a lot more sensitive about people killing animals for fur than killing them for meat, leather, etc. Just make sure you check the tag the next time before you buy a coat if you don't like fur.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	If you are morally opposed to using animals for fur then the only ethical choice you can make is to get rid of the jacket and read the label more closely next time you make a purchase.  Personally it wouldn't bother me because I am not opposed to raising animals (and rabbits in particular) for meat and fur.|`|sOkePjK3aa	I'm am completely against all of that. I'm not watching the video cuz I already know what it is going to be. Keep wearing you jacket. It's one jacket. You've had it for a while probably, so it's okay. I always check the tags on my clothes before I buy them just to make sure. :] YOu should do that as well. :] Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|xi9amEG2aa	Wow.  The last time I checked....sheep are sheered....and don't have chunks of flesh cut out of them.  The sheering of the sheep is not cruel...it's pretty much just cutting their wool, and ONLY wool off of them.  I've usually seen it in the summer when it's obviously hotter for them.  It's pretty much a hair cut for them.  I have NEVER heard of sheep having chunks cut out of their skin just to get the wool.      I eat meat.  Yes, I know an animal was killed for it, but I couldn't stand being a vegetarian.  Plants are living things too, you know.  But anyways, I think PETA takes it a little to far with somethings.  I don't wear fur, unless it's from an Angora animal, like a rabbit.  (the rabbits aren't killed, they're sheered like the sheep....it's just a hair cut for them)....anything that I have that is 'leather', it's that fake leather....pleather or whatever you call it.      If you don't like the idea that it has a little rabbit fur in it, see if you can sell it.  If you can't sell it, just don't wear it.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	i would still use it|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	I eat meat, wear leather shoes, belts etc.  My dogs wear leather collars, and use leather leashes.    No problem with a fur lined hat or jacket here.|`|19a9c1720c92194802be24f06430fb7faa	I agree with Canis Lupus (the answerer). It is socially acceptable to kill animals for necessity such as food. With regards to leather, it is less obvious where the material came from since people don't give it a second thought. I think people find it more controversial if animals are killed for recreational or fashion purposes as they are not necessities.     Personally, this world is design for the fittest, and preying on other species are just a natural part of life. The only time I strongly oppose is when animals are abused before being slaughtered or they are killed to near extinction.    Culturally speaking, people in Africa, India, and even Eskimos kill animals not just for food but for clothing as well. It's nothing new but it is up to various culture how they perceive this matter as being morally acceptable or not.     If it bothers you that much then throw it away because you will never be consciously comfortable with wearing it knowing where the fur came from. It will be against your principle to wear it. Only you can decide.|`|L6IewTNLaa	i get where your comming from  and its horrible to think of someone killing a rabit so that someone can look pretty.   i wouldkeep the jacket though. you didnt but it and really they probably didnt put the rabit fur in there for cosmetic reasons.|`|tTLg4u9laa	I would toss the jacket or let my dogs sleep with it.    Fake fur is fine but I just really do not like using animal furs for my clothing, and I am not even a Vegan nor a PETA supporter.  I just do not like it.|`|PM23RDycaa	What does this have to do with dogs?    Anyways if its bothers you that much sell the jacket and donate the money to anyone but PETA or HSUS.     ADD: I knew it was gonna be a PETA vid. I don't care what those crazies have to say. They don't want to eat meat? Fine, more for me.
ZJ2tem3baa	Alot of things can cause a kitty to puke.  Alot of times they will eat something that they shouldnt (such as food dropped on the floor, trash, a bug, etc.) and this will cause a disruption in their GI tract.  I wouldnt worry too much, it sounds like she just got into something she shouldnt have and her body is just trying to get rid of it.  The vet can get you some anti-vomiting meds to help her get through it.  I would also check her stools and make sure she doesnt have any diarrhea b/c that would require a different type of med also.  I would definitely take her to the vet like you are planning to and hopefully they can get her fixed up.|`|ULxBUoclaa	well she could have eaten a plant around the house or some other substance. she could have a hairball. make her drink some water, this will either educe the vomiting and make her vomit whatever bad is in there out or it will calm her stomach. sorry i couldn't be more help!|`|TVlYwhsEaa	i know how u feel i have a cat like that  it's probably the food that you're feeding her. or maybe sometimes when cats throw up, they tend to eat it...then throw it back up. but when u guys take it to the vet i'm sure you'll find out  I hope it's okay|`|1ylpCN3yaa	Don't leave it too long to go to the vet, I waited an extra day when my cat was vomiting, to see if she would get better, but they dehydrate so quickly. And by the time I got her there the next morning she was at deaths door. They never found the cause but they gave her IV fluids and antibiotics and medication to stop her from vomiting and she became healthy once again.|`|C8vWBAqiaa	Just keep her comfy until you go to the vet dont let her eat that much|`|sGq3U9y7aa	i am so sorry to hear that. i think she is dehydrated. the best thing to do is take her to the vet. Or maybe she is overweight. i take care of cats at the Humane Society at the effingham mall.  or maybe she ate to fast, and sometimes it can be hairballs. But i would really go to the vet as soon as possible.
5QG9Zrjaaa	I have 19 inch calves and wear a 10.  They don't make them off the shelf, and I wish I could find semi custom for less than $500.    What I did is to get Mountain Horse boots (they have a zipper and are much easier to get on and off, and the elastic gullet helps with fit) and take them to the local shoe repair place and had them add a leather gusset so they would fit.  They aren't pretty, but they are comfortable, and good to stand and teach or ride in, whichever is part of my day.    You could do this with any brand of boots obviously, but I find the Mountain horse to be a little wider in the foot.  I would get a zipper, because that makes life much easier.  I used to get a back spasm pulling on my custom Dehner's.  Those were the most comfortable, but I don't want to shell out $850 for them again.    edit--You know, paddocks and half chaps would be great, but I can't find half chaps big enough either!|`|8AHUuhbvaa	why do you need tall boots?  why not get leather paddock boots and some half chaps, they last longer and they aren't a pain in the *** to break in.  it's not worth it to get tall boots unless your competing.|`|WJJMZ9IQaa	Well just to let you know 2 things:  1. Boots are a pain in the *** to break in... I'm in pain as we type just wearing mine (got a new pair of ariats for a show in less than 2 weeks!)  2. You probably won't find any halfway decent pair of semi customs for under $150. The cheapest I've seen is over $500    Have you tried looking at some boots in a wide calf?    I just bought some Ariat boots size 9 slim width/tall height. Have you tried looking for some with a wide size calf?
GpflXB0raa	I dont raise mallards, but I know about them. When they are young you can vent se-x them. I recommend taking the duckling to a vet to do that. When they are older the female has the harsher quack and the male has a more low tone quack. For mallards the male will have a green head and the body colors are more prominent. Females are brown colored.
ngebYukSaa	oh yeah, my cat uses the toilet. Its soooo great, i would never go back to the litter trays (which stink!) I cant stand cleaning the trays and besides we live in an apartment and the smell would reek the whole place out.    I got this kit from a pet supply store called 'litter kwitter' you can see the weblink that ive posted for it.    The trick is to be patient and reward your cat for good behaviour. My cat does all his business in the toilet and all i have to do is flush! Its the best trick Ive EVER taught my cat.    And for those ppl who think its un natural...if the cat didnt find it a good experience, ie was positively rewarded, then it wouldnt continue doing its business in the toilet. The cats posture is the same, just the raking of soil instinct is not used.    You dont need to worry that your cat will forget how to use a litter tray. They ALWAYS know what to do with soil, its instintive.    Good luck!    ps: thought i would add - the site says that cats of any age can learn to use the litter kwitter system, but obviously the younger the better. It takes on average 8 weeks to teach them so be patient. If the cat is agile enough, he can hop onto a normal toilet seat, otherwise you can provide them with a little step to help them get up that high. Your cat shouldnt need this as he is only 5.  It help in our household that we have 2 bathrooms. My cat has a whole bathroom / ensuite to himself!|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	why would you want to force your cat to do something totally unnatural?|`|AA12398420	youtube has many videos on how to train your kitty to use the toilet.  There is absolutely nothing wrong in training your cat to use the toilet.  I provided one of my favorite links.|`|fZQXxM5vaa	Tsk Tsk Tsk|`|q9yCfq4eaa	They have kits that help with that and try getting like a toddler toliet seat and sprinkling litter on it then they will think to use it.|`|RA2afpeRaa	lol funny, maybe you could try to put all four of his legs (unless he has 3 legs like my cat) on the toilet when he has to go to the "potty" and stand there until he uses it and when he does give him or her a piece of ham.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Heya  Try this website it gives you lots of ideas/ information about training our kitty and helping it be calm etc|`|C021mpLLaa	Umm..if you're going to make your cat use a toilet you should just use a very low, old bowl.|`|XfzgA03baa	yes my sister has a cat and she thought her cat to use the toilet byhimself in about 3 week.  You should give him food everytime he does the right thing, well thats what my sister did.    If you have any more questions, contact me and ill ask my sister
4yt4D3vMaa	Not like cats but they grind their teeth which can make them quiver sometimes-with my rabbit it's his cheeks that quiver. They do it when they are happy so it's compared to cats purring-it's their version anyway!|`|4gcTZNZBaa	Yes rabbits do purr. One kinds of pur is when they grind there teeth softly.
mFNEbR3Maa	i like both types of dogs but i would prefer the doberman because the doberman knows how to actually stand up for him self both are great at that but i would so prefer the doberman but just go with your heart you`ll make the right choice :) good luck :D|`|ERjGLJaEaa	I've always loved Rotts. They have the best personalities. I haven't really been around many Dobermans. My friend has some min pins, but that's about it.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I would choose the rottie simply because I have owned one and fostered 2 of these wonderful dogs and know what great animals they are.|`|JsBb732Maa	Doberman, because I think that they are elegant looking.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Neither    Both are nice looking dogs but not for me.|`|xi9amEG2aa	I would prefer a Great Dane.      But, if I had to choose between those two, I'd go with the Doby.  I think that they have a better look to them, than the Rottie.  I like the sleek looking dogs.|`|r62mRF3waa	I don't know too much about both, but I do no both those dogs are big sort of gaurdish dogs. What i would do is find the positives and negatives to both of them then see which ever one has more positives is the one you should choose. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cLm5FqWnaa	Doberman. They are way more badass|`|gjD8pndjaa	Doberman, prefer the appearance/tempereament|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	Rottweiler, they are stronger and have less health problems. Both are good family dogs if raised right.|`|ANf5FzTXaa	Dobberman|`|QGecNxmgaa	Doberman all the way. They look better and my mom took care of them every summer.|`|8AHUuhbvaa	doby, they are way more elegant, and like 10x more intelligent.|`|3YMETqStaa	It would depend on breeders for me.  I'd prefer my dobie to be uncropped but docked and my rottie to be undocked.  It is very rare to find legitimate breeders that do this so which ever I could find I would get.  I love both types though, they are both dogs and I love dogs.|`|C8vWBAqiaa	Rottweiler because they area lot cooler but that is my opinion so go with your heart ( Rottweiler )|`|gv5DsZRZaa	both.   rotties are huge babies (  i LOVE that :)  )  and dobermans are all around good dogs. :)|`|igpMQn0kaa	Rottie. I personally don't like the looks of Dobies. Too thin. Rotties are chunkier (especially the German lines) and are big love bugs!

1T0MQ5zwaa	Well, if the vet visit is just $50, then the operation, antibotics, and prolly overnight stay is gonna range from $175 - $200.  That's not including if your kitty is not up to date with his vaccinations.  Which is another $75, so I guess you'll be spending the most around $300.    But there are some vet clinics that do accept payment plans, just as long as you put half down.    I hope this helped and good luck with you and your kitty.|`|AA11736483	Costs can range all over the place, depending upon the vet.   Here's a suggestion. When you go in, ask them about the cost. Say what you said here - that you have only a little bit of money but you will go without eating if you have to to help your beloved cat. They will probably feel sorry and give you a break.
ZJ2tem3baa	Sounds like you are off to a good start.  Some things I have learned over the years that have helped me is:    have the kitty tested for FIV/feline leukemia  get her shots every year!  have a fecal sample tested every year for parasites  get her examined by a vet ever year!  brush her teeth if she will let you  keep an eye on her teeth and have the vet let you know when it is time for a dental so she doesnt lose any teeth  once the kitty turns 7 she will be considered a geriatric kitty, have them run a full blood panel every year from the age of 7 and on  consider having her microchipped if she isnt already    I think the two most important things to living a full life is having the blood work pulled every year and keeping a good eye on her teeth.  Blood work every year will allow them to monitor any changes so she doesnt come up with any significant diseases without you knowing.  Get dentals done BEFORE her teeth are bad.  But other than that just love her like you are!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	1.  Spayed/Neutered  2.  Kept indoors or supervised outside for short periods of time.  3.   Vet care - shots, FELV tests, etc.  4.

YLYAo2zmaa	Beagles are awesome pets. They are affectionate, easy to care for with little grooming required. They do not bark any more than any other dog. I have several, mine and then my husband's hunting and trial beagles on top of that.  My neighbor's house is only about 50 feet from my kennel area, I have never had a complaint. Some beagles do overeat, but you are the human and in control of that. Ask her present owners questions about her in particular.  I would take her in a red hot minute if I were you.|`|cFu2ZV3haa	All animals have individual personalities. As far as being over eaters and barking all the time; these are not traits that are common to Beagles. They are affectionate and loyal so you may find that they have bonded to their previous owners and this may present some problems during the transition. It would be better for the dog if they kept her. I had a beagle when I was a kid. They are good family dogs. If you want to know more there are plenty of web sites about dogs, I'm sure the AKC site has plenty of information about beagles. Just go to Google.com, type in "beagle" and all sorts of stuff will come up. Don't rely on what people here say. Although there are some knowledgeable people there are a lot of kids who just guess answers for points like it's some kind of game.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. They are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques. Their noses guide them through life, and they're never happier than when following an interesting scent. The Beagle originally was bred as a scenthound to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. He is still used for this purpose in many countries, including the United States.  here's more info:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=141706332612...    hope this helps.|`|1S5AbPueaa	We just got a Beagle almost 2 weeks ago.He is 5 years old.He is quite the beggar,he will follow his nose right into trouble..lol.He is a also a very good dog.I do not think he barks a lot.My neighbors dog now that thing barks.He is pretty laid back actually.He is good with my boys and likes to lounge around.He loves going on walks,and saying he LOVES to eat is an understatement.Also you cant let them out without a leash.Which we have learned the hard way 3 times.They will be gone.It is the Beagle nose:)|`|EeJMITyCaa	Beagles bark alot as a breed.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Introduction  Beagle puppies are among the cutest critters on God's green Earth. Doubters of this bit of wisdom are referred to the soft drink commercial of several years ago in which a pack of Beagle puppies overwhelmed a small child, bringing gales of laughter as they licked his face. No one could watch that commercial without bursting into hearty laughter themselves  or without gaining instant appreciation for the puppies that brought such joy to a little boy.    Beagles are merry adults, eager to romp and play with children, toys, or other dogs. Pack animals to the nth degree, they need companionship more than most other breeds. Indeed, a Beagle left to his own devices will be noisy, destructive, or both.    Mist shrouds the actual origins of the Beagle as it does many other breeds, but there is little doubt that the merry rabbit hunter shares ancestors with the larger Harrier and English Foxhound. Although legends exist about hounds in King Arthur's Camelot, the Beagle is probably descended from Talbot Hounds that traveled to England with William the Conquerer in 1066.    There are records of dogs that hunted in packs with their keepers in both England and Wales in the 13th Century. Early on, these hounds were divided by size; the large ones hunted deer and other large game and the small ones hunted hares, rabbits, and pheasants. The small hounds were called beighs or beagles, perhaps after beigle, the French word for useless or of little value, or beag the Celtic word for small.    These early hounds probably did not resemble the Beagles of today. In the 1700s, rabbit-hunting dogs all but disappeared in England as fox-hunting grew in popularity. Farmers kept the breed alive by keeping packs of Beagles, but it wasn't until the 1800s that the breed developed into the dog we know today as the happy-go-lucky dog with a nose that doesn't quit.    The Beagle came to the US in 1876 and was recognized by the American Kennel Cub in 1884. Today it is one of the country's most popular breeds; in 1996, its 56,946 new registrations placed it fifth among 143 AKC breeds.      --------------------------------------...    Beagle physique   The Beagle is a well-muscled, small-to-almost-medium-sized dog with a keen sense of smell and a wanderlust that can lead him into trouble. He comes in two sizes  under 13 inches tall and 13-15 inches tall. Weight for the smaller dogs is 18-20 pounds; for the larger dogs is 20-30 pounds.     The standard allows any hound color, which includes tri-color (black, brown, and white), red and white, lemon and white, and tan and white. Solid white or tan is possible but very rare. The color pattern can include mottling, ticking, or grizzling.    The Beagle's soft brown eyes are probably his most appealing feature. One long gaze into the eyes and the potential owner is likely to become an actual owner, for the breed has mastered the trick of looking as if he doesn't have a friend in the world. Ears are long  but not as long as the Basset's. When pulled forward, they should almost reach the end of the nose; when at rest they should tip over and lie close to the head.    The Beagle's compact body is longer than tall. He carries his moderately-long tail like a flag above his back, providing a marker when he follows scent through tall grass.     Beagle coat is hard and short but sheds. It is a double coat, with fine undercoat and coarser top coat; it is generally thicker in winter and sheds most heavily in spring.       --------------------------------------...    The Beagle as pet  Although he has a merry and tractable disposition, the Beagle is not the dog for every family. His wanderlust, need for activity, and loud voice make him unsuitable for sedentary families or for apartments or unfenced yards. This is a sociable dog developed to work in packs. If he's an only pet, the Beagle's family must be prepared more than most to provide stimulation for the dog to keep him home. Otherwise, his need for companionship and his desire to follow his nose to adventure could lead him to adopt another family, get arrested for running at large, or worse, get hit by a car.    Gentle and generally pleased with life, the Beagle can also be stubborn and difficult to obedience train or house train. Few Beagles compete in obedience trials, for they are easily distracted by the sight or scent of any animal that crosses their path  or crossed it hours ago. However, training is critical for the breed  especially the command to come. However, since Beagles who know the command under most circumstances may not obey when hot on the trial of a squirrel or rabbit  or the neighbor's cat  owners must be ever vigilant to keep Snoopy home. The intent of the chase is the chase, and the drive is deep. Once a Beagle is out of sight, he may be gone forever.    Beagle stubbornness should not rule the day; a puppy kindergarten and
9kceDOTraa	Not sure here, but I think sometimes German measurements of KH are called DH.  Maybe you mean your GH?  General hardness?    You raise your pH through raising your GH and KH.  The difference between GH and KH is that KH is specifically the dissolved calcium in the water, and your GH is the measurement of all dissolved minerals.    I have a couple articles worth reading over, and the fact of the matter is, raising up your GH and KH through use of as someone called it, "chemicals" is not as ineffective as they think.    I constantly use Rift Lake Salts and Buffer Max to keep my GH and KH up in my African tanks, and it doesn't do a damn thing to my water chemistry, other then help keep it stable.    No matter if you over dosed these salts, you still can't raise the pH over 8.5 anyways.  You can use crushed coral yes, but by far, this is not your only means or option.  Argonite is a good useful tool here to consider in addition to consider using Buffer salts.  I prefer buffer salts myself since you can use that during water changes, and just dose accordingly.  Very easy and simple, with no risk to your water chemistry.    Read these over:    http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/...    http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/...    You'll be very challenged to find as good article and researched material out there then our site    http://www.everything-aquatic.com/    Feel free to ask all you want here.  You won't find a more professional staff out there.|`|00RgkZF8aa	Don't buy the stuff that claims to raise your pH or hardness, because most of the times they just mess up your water chemistry more than it helps it.    Instead, try placing some crushed coral in your filter. This will help raise the pH and water hardness.|`|FOdBeBUTaa	i didn't know you could get a degree in aquariums.  imma pursue that|`|37TowRL7aa	easy!  go to the petstore and it has stiff called, higher PH, 8.2 ph, lower PH, higher DH.  i dont kno wat DH is, but i kno PH like a master(african cichlids!)|`|NmwRGetKaa	Hello,    First of all you have to look what you have in your tank,  usually Driftwood lowers the ph while some rock  will raise it,     My local water comes out from the drain at a 7.2 ph   and once it's in my tank goes up to 8.2 thanks to the   granite rock and play sand i have in the tank  crush coral is also good for raising the ph,  there is a commercial product\sand call  caribsea eco_complete for african cichlids that has  live bacteria that will raise your ph up to 8.4  google it for more info,    texas holey rock would be another approach but it's   way too expensive    well good luck.
a2cjwMKcaa	If the guppy has ich then the whole tank is infected, the others just aren't showing it yet. So treat the whole tank for the full time that the meds say to kill off all the parasites that are in the tank.    You may loose the guppy, but you should be able to save the rest of your fish by treating it early.    Ian|`|EKg97zZlaa	definitely!  the ick is already in the water so the medicine will stop the spread of the sickness and get rid of it.also it's good to add the medicine to the whole tank because the other fish might already have the  sickness but it's just starting so you can't see it.  the medicine will make your buddy all beter no doubt!|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	turn off the filter put in the medicine turn back on the filter about 24 hrs later.    turn up your heater to 86 degrees|`|Bw18seFqaa	yes you can put it in with the other fish.. odds are if you do not medicate, your other fish will get ich within the next few days anyways.    I highly reccomend the brand name Jungle for aquatic medicines.|`|8e29d822ee2591d8c0d0032e70287c8baa	If she has ick ,it is in the tank already. And administering  the meds in the tank would serve as a prophylactic for the other fish in the tank.And make sure the heat is set appropriatley|`|791d4f9e4f79c13e41e826352dcb9b61aa	Yes you can, the other fish need to be treated also
j4fcOlqdaa	Your cat is only scared, dale much affection|`|T11RWeaPaa	I know this sounds weird but...    Talk to her, in a calm soothing voice, just talk to her. But give her, her space, let her come to you. When we first got our cat she was scared out of her mind, it took a while before she trusted us. We threw her pieces of deli meat, only a little, so she wouldnt get sick. soon she would come to us and she would eat the meat from our hands, and we could touch her. we kept talking to her, kept feeding her and giving her water and proper care. every time we gave her some meat or a treat, we pet her for as long as we could until she ran away. soon she started coming on her own, jumping on our laps, rubbing her head on our legs, purring.     We never thought that our abused cat would ever cuddle with us, but as im typing this she is sleeping, cuddled on my feet!    Just be patient!     Good luck!|`|AwicI0VJaa	slowly, by showing her to other cats for small amount of time at a time and for longer amounts of time.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	You can show her that you are not a bad person who abuses animals. Just give her food and water. She will learn that you are not a bad person. She will like you soon.|`|E7BARYJZaa	It takes alot of patience and kind words and actions.    I adopted my cat from a shelter almost 2 1/2 years ago.    When I went to meet Riley for the first time at the foster home it took alot of patience for her to even come near me.  They told me I was the only one who had gotten that close so of course she had to come home with me.    Within 4 days she was wanting belly rubs.  She hates being held and is not a lap cat but is still very affectionate.  She sits beside me or behind me and always sleeps on my bed.  She still jumps at loud noises and is not very trusting but I love her.    I've never forced her to be something she is not although I wish she would sit on my lap, but at least she has a warm place to call home now.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Hi,  Try checking out this website it gives alot of tips and ideas   I got a kitty from work yesterday and took her home she's also very scared
YQfEOeStaa	A hot water bottle and a ticking clock will do wonders to soothe your puppy while you are gone. Do you crate him? Crating is also the easiest and quickest way to potty train your pup.    There is a DVD on the market that supposedly entertains dogs while you are gone, you just pop it into the DVD player and turn on the TV. I have one for my cats, and they try attacking the TV screen to get the "bugs" that are crawling across it. It is hilarious to watch. I don't use the dog one much because we just put our dogs outside when we are gone, but it might be something you want to look into, probably for less than $10. It is called "Dog sitter" -- just google Dog Sitter DVD.     Good luck!|`|bIaywrBCaa	classical music seems to be more soothing to dogs.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Wish I knew what to tell you, Hope it works out for you.|`|O545aSKWaa	You can also try talk radio, we've seen that it seems to help out a lot. It drowns out all the little noise that drives dogs crazy.    Also have you thought about putting a clock that ticks in its bedding? maybe hearing the ticking will help soothe it since it can sound like the mothers heartbeat.    As for during the day, try toys and treats to help keep it occupied while you're out.|`|QxxCN4pVaa	a clicking clock helps. it mocks the sound of its mother heartbeat. and a warm water bottle under some blankets will help too...it also mocks the warmth of it mother too.
S6P9gSX8aa	not unless they're funny cigarettes|`|AnImYu4Haa	The word ''make'' doesnt suggest cruelty to you? thats crazy by the way, cruel, immoral, sick, horrible etc|`|4gcTZNZBaa	yes and they will take ur rabbit away for that|`|velIdcbNaa	Yes very much so! you jerk! It's like making a baby smoke.  It's wrong and immoral.   if you do this, them you have a cruel sense of humor, and have a low self esteem.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	Yes it is|`|J7o7FtZdaa	Yes how would u like it if u were ur rabbit and it made u smoke and they would probably die a lot faster.|`|I2aoh7OMaa	YES!!!!

TkJn9gO0aa	First time females will usually lay about 4-5 clutches their first year....and the very first clutch might just be 1 egg as opposed to the usual 2 eggs.    At optimal breeding capacity, females can lay as much as 10-12 clutches per year, but the female must be maintained at optimal health and some people say this actually decreases the life span of the female and her fertility.     The average number of clutches a year for a proven female is about 8 clutches.|`|CdRlOsnyaa	they can lay up to 8 clutches a year each cluctch can contain 1-2 eggs|`|8e29d822ee2591d8c0d0032e70287c8baa	i don't know|`|YrXqtMHHaa	Well, it is a young gecko, I would say three to four eggs a clutch. However, all leopard geckos can only breed in the breeding season, which means that only two clutches maximum, and it might not happen.     However, I'm glad you posted a decent straight-forward question.     Hope I helped.
AA10531150	I'm sorry!  I hope the below helps...    Put some of his food outside... that may attract him home.  Also put a dirty sock outside so he can smell your scent.  Then call your local humane soc. and see if they've received any strays matching his description.    Good luck!|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Ring up the pound, they may have picked your cat up.  If no luck, knock on all your neighbours doors and ask. You can't accuse someone if you have no proof, so don't go doing that.  Make up a flyer and a poster. Letterbox drop the flyers and stick the posters up. Unfortunately, there is much else you can do. People pick cats up all the time and of course some get hit by cars. It's best not to let your cat out at all.|`|1T0MQ5zwaa	If your kitty hasn't come home yet, then I would post up lost posters on the corners of your neigborhood, especially around school areas (I say a good 3 mile radius should be enough).    Since he is chipped, I would call the company asap to let them know he is missing.  Also, please visit shelters, pet stores, and vet clinics, and give them a recent photo of your kitty.  Another good idea is walk down the street and if you see anyone, talk to them, if they have seen him.    I hope you find him.|`|8DKNAn0iaa	go ask her have you seen my cat?  if not wait another day?  and then if shses not there make posters :)  best of luck|`|9Q2AFZpJaa	Oooh not good. Well, I would wait and put some food outside. Wait until the next morning like tomorrow and if he still doesn't come, contact your vet or shelter. If your pet has a chip, I think you can find him. How? IDk but I think that's what the chip is for. ;)|`|1ylpCN3yaa	Ask people to check in their sheds. My neighbours cat was missing,and I kept heard this cat crying but every time I went outside it would stop. I told my neighbour and she ask me to check in the shed it wasn't there, but it was under our house and there is a small door that closes to that area so she was stuck there. Other wise put up posters and put a smelly fish out at night. I have lost 2 cats but I have found 2 the other was stuck in the fence with a broken leg we put up posters and found the owner. Now I keep my cat inside the long haired cats don't seem to mind it. I escort her out for a while most days but she is used to being inside and doesn't like to go out for long. I'll never loose another cat. I do hope you find him.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I do hope you find him soon.  This is a good example of why its important to keep cats inside or only allowed out under supervision (harness/leash or cat enclosure).|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Take a pair of your shoes and set them near your outside doorway.  Or a jacket or shirt of somekind until he gets the scent and comes home.  I hope he makes it home.  Set a dish of water and some of his food by the door outside too.|`|8AHUuhbvaa	there's not much you can do.  post signs, call your local shelter to see if they've seen him, and pray...
qqUvoC5uaa	My dog loves it.   http://files.dogster.com./pix/dogs/30/30...    It has to be done in moderation and safely.   Dogs can fall off and hurt themselves just as humans do. Or if they jump too high and land the wrong way, they can hurt themselves.     Just take the proper precautions, don't jump too high, don't get too rough and don't fall off.    With a dane mix I could possibly see a cause for concern as they I believe tend to have some back and leg problems due to their size, I am unsure about Weims though.|`|C021mpLLaa	On a nice day I bring my dachsuand puppy on the trampoline to play fetch, but I don't jump. As long as you're not junping super hard.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Random hitting here and there on a limited surface area is kind of dumb for a human.  Human and dog is even worse.|`|WL3YWdf8aa	no! dude, dogs arent human. they cant land like us, they arch their backs and what if you accidently bounce him too high? he might land on his back and even fall off, stop doing this before he gets hurt!!!|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	listen to your father, he knows what he is talking about.|`|8AHUuhbvaa	trampolines can hurt dogs just as they can hurt humans.  but since dogs do have 4 legs it could stress out their backs.  also, dogs don't really have as much sense when it comes to what happens when you do certain things on trampolines.|`|VQX9e0mxaa	as long as theyre not gigantic jumps, id say its fine...but u have to be extra careful because dogs are built different than humans are, and trampolines are human things....it could damage their muscles and back and leg bones because dogs do not know when to jump and relax like humans...but for a dog that size, a few smaller jumps wouldnt hurt
orQM8Xp9aa	I'm sure you're doing fine.  If it's still fairly young it is probably just adjusting.  One thing you can do is associate any scary situation with a positive one.  When outside give them lots of love and take some treats on walks.  Best of luck.  I'm sure things will go just fine as you have chosen an incredible breed. :)|`|cUKqmNAlaa	How sweet - I bet your puppy is bringing you lots of joy?    The puppy will look to you to teach it whats ok and whats not so be gentle and encourage it to take tiny steps at first and give lots of treats and encouragement. Its vital to start socialisation as early as you can to prevent more serious issues later - to get a happy and carefree adult dog who is not scared around people or other animals.    Take a look at the Puppy Whisperer book which you can find in the books section at http://www.loveshihtzu.com    It gave Geordie and I lots of help.    Good luck!
SMFhXxcfaa	I believe the spray only lasts for about 2 hours or so, you may need to read the instruction sheet, it should tell you how long it lasts.  You may need to play with how much you spray to see what fits your cat best.  You may want to invest in the feliway that plugs into an outlet.
rUMlDAINaa	How about something completely different? Instead of a butch name for a tough looking dog, you could name him/her something with a little sweetness to it:    Sugarbuttons    Lovey-bumpers    Babydoll    Precious (hmmm, maybe too Silence of the Lambs)    And the list goes on...  I think Pits are really great dogs, but a lot of their very bad public image comes from this "macho" and violent idea of them. So, why encourage that idea? You can knock all the naysayers on their heads when you walk your blue pit (definitely the most beautiful anyway) past the soccer moms, look down the leash and coo, "Mister Wuffles is the bestest lil' doggie in the woooooooorld!!"|`|ZooGr9r4aa	I named my pit bull "Riot"...works for both males and females|`|k0qTaSceaa	mu pit bull's name is gottie and when i get another one i will name him capone lol it hink they are so cute.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	Name it something positive, not negative!"Kinder" pronounced like tinder with a k, German for "child", Blue, Boo, Nanny, etc.|`|v6mQzSSbaa	Chaos, Bayle|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Sky   Blue  Kamil  Rage  Hurley  Harley  Chance  Destiny  Onslow  Caos  Sasha  Sam  Sinder  Delia  Burkley  Payne  Scraps  Brutus  Baily   Hope you like|`|d2X6zGFSaa	rocky, bullet, echo|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	Mine are: Sadie, Jade ,Dakota, Princess, Junior,Boo, Mega
uBFhKXgHaa	No, Purina One is a low quality cat food too. You will not find a high quality cat food at any grocery store/super market!    You do not need a formula for UTI's, you just need to feed an all wet/canned diet.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Excellent raw feeding information for cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  |`|nzgZR6onaa	I have owned many cats. I actually use to breed cats and I never used food to control any UTI. I had to watch food for food alergies thats all,or different types of food for different age groups of course.UTI in any human or animal is not caused or controlled by any type of food.My friends are vets and I ran this by them also.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	These formula foods are terrible., Clean the litter box after each use  to help prevent uti's Add probiotics to the food each day   No reason ever to feed dry food        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|lTsDwY9Paa	No, Purina is just as bad a Special Kitty. My oldest cat had one UTI on California Natural and I immediately switched her to a grain free food. You need to put her on a food with little to no grains if you're that worried about UTIs.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	That food is fine.  Your cat needs plenty of water though.  It's a must to feed your kitty wet food at least twice a day.  If you can, leave the faucet dripping or get a cat fountain to help encourage your cat to take in water.  If your cat ever starts urinating outside the litter box, THAT would be the time to take her to get checked for a UTI.  That can be the first sign of one.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	Look for a low ash and low magnesium food,I have my cat on 1 and she is doing well on it.

it3Bh2wEaa	I personally would just get a new saddle. Even though it may be expensive to buy a new one, it'll pay off then just keeping your current one that DOES have a fitting problem, which could ultimately injure him permantly and rake up a high vet bill.         If you don't have the budget for a brand new one, look into QUALITY used saddles. They tend to be lesser in price, and they have the added bonus of being broken in abit. Just make sure to work out a deal with the seller for a "test run" to make sure it fits both your horse and you properly!|`|an1L8njXaa	Ive currently got a horse who came to me with back problems due to a badly fitting saddle, he is permanatly lame and on massive amounts of pain medication and we are having the physio up to him 2 times a week, we have given this horse untill spring to improve or we will have him PTS.   This horse was CRIPPLED by a badly fitting saddle.    Badly fitting saddles cause muscle damage, nerve damage, muscle wastage, there has been a proven link between badly fitting saddles and kissing spines. As well as a link between badly fitting saddles and cold backed horses, as well as spinal damage    A badly fitting saddle is not just uncomfortable or annoying it is very very damaging and can cause long term incurable damage to a horse!    GET your self a new saddle and do not ride in your old one.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	it can give him saddle sores, pinch his back, and make him act up when you ride him. he'll be uncomfortable, so he might buck, kick or rear to get the saddle off.  i think that you should probably get a new saddle, or borrow one that fits until you can get a new one.|`|7Msk7HhKaa	Probably just annoying to him. If it's so bad that it causes him to act up, it'll actually probably be more of a danger to you. (Getting tossed and thrown and such.) Most likely not a major problem though, no sweat. If you've got any more questions, feel free to ask.|`|r5aokD7Yaa	obviously, the first step to avoiding damage is recognizing that the things we do can cause harm-- I sincerely wish you the best luck in eventually locating a saddle that both fits you and your horse. For one of mine, this has been a seven year quest-- imagine a barrel with legs and you've got an idea of what my Duck looks like-- saddles don't want to stay in place unless they're over tight.    as for saddle fit    When you tack up, if the saddle puts your weight over his kidneys, you'll cause him pain.    If the saddle bumps his spine, you'll cause him pain and may possibly knock vertebrae out of alignment.    After riding, when you remove the saddle, if the area under the pad is mostly wet with dry patches you'll eventually have issues (the dry is from too much pressure on small areas [maybe 2x3 inches] cutting off circulation).    Riding for a short time (or for several short rides) in an ill fitting saddle will not usually cause permanent harm- I'd avoid riding the urge to go competitive trail or endurance riding in an ill fitting saddle :)|`|SrkoKZWuaa	It's very uncomfortable for them.  Imagine you trying to run in shoes that are two sizes to small.  It can cause them to act mean and behave badly, such as crow hopping and rearing. Not to mention that it will probably leave saddle sores. Icky! and the permanent white mark will be on their withers forever.|`|RloOJ43haa	A saddle that does not fit can do significant damage to a horse's back. You may have seen horses that have white hair on or near their withers. That is all scar tissue from saddles that don't fit. In addition poorly fitting saddles cause many behavior problems. If you put on a pair of tennis shoes that hurt your feet, you probably would not want to go jogging. Similarly if you put a saddle that hurts on your horse, you make riding him painful and you sap his work ethic.     If you saddle does not fit, then you need another one and that is all there is to it.|`|cZ6Nztysaa	last year, we discovered that my horse's saddle was not fitting her properly.  She was having a lot of behavior problems and didn't want to canter anymore.  Once we changed her saddle, she transformed!  She is so much happier now and more relaxed when I am on her.  In the long run, a saddle can really affect a horse's performance and attitude.  If you have to wait a few weeks to find a new saddle, it won't do him much harm, but you should know that if you can find a saddle that fits him properly, he will be a much happier horse!|`|QC3YUpByaa	It can actually cause a lot of damage. Pressure on his spine can cause nerve or spinal chord damage, and if it sits wrong on his muscles it can cause atrophy (wasting away of the muscles) since he can`t use them properly. Poor saddle fit can also affect the way he moves, making him stiff and susceptible to other injury. You and he will both be happier with a well fitting saddle. Just make sure you get a professional, or someone experienced to help you.|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	An ill-fitting saddle can cause permanent damage to the horses' anatomy if used long and often enough.  If you know the saddle is pinching or hitting wrong on any part of the horse, then you must absolutely make a change.  If possible, have a professional saddle-fitter fit your horse with a good saddle.  Conformation plays a large role in saddle-fitting.  If you ride often, the right saddle will make all the difference in the world.  Invest in a good saddle pad also, for the greatest comfort for your horse.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	Absolutely find a different saddle, or have a saddle fitter out.  They may be able to tweak the padding to have it fit.    A bad fitting saddle is cruel to your horse.  At best, it makes their back hurt.  Not real fair considering that when you ride, you are expecting them to perform like they're not in pain. A ridden horse is an athelete.  Picture trying to go out and run track successfully in a pair of Kmart canvas shoes.  Not comfy, right?  Well, now picture doing something just as uncomfortable to your back, and put somebody who's about 10% of your weight on top of that sore area.   Uneven pressure on muscles and vertibrae can cause long term soreness and make them sour on work.  It can also cause rubbing and hair loss.|`|MBwln1m7aa	Get a saddle raiser pad if you can't afford to buy a new saddle now. You should only use them as a temporary solution though. You should buy a new saddle as soon as you can afford one.

5QG9Zrjaaa	He looks like a foundation bred quarter horse, he doesn't appear to have draft in him.  Hair length wouldn't be the clue if that were so.|`|jiTDwqaEaa	If you really want to tell, you could ask your vet about doing a DNA test that might reveal if he is or not. To me he doesn't look like he has draft in him, he looks like a foundation style QH. They were more of the working-cow horse type that have wide chests, lots of muscling, and big butts. 15 HH isn't an uncommon size for a QH, if he was 16+hh I would start to question his breed.   But whatever his breeding, he's a cutie!|`|fydy8Zjpaa	no I dont think so. He just looks like a very muscular qh. I had a horse that had a qh sire and a Draft dam. He was HUGE!! you would really be able to tell if your horse had draft in it.     http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x269/...    here is my friend on another draft x    http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x269/...|`|14PrlLjFaa	Doesnt really look like it.....looks more QH-ish. Might be a bad picture, but that's my take.|`|it3Bh2wEaa	Most draft horses vary from breed to breed. Some common characteristics are the feathering (the long hair around the fetlocks and legs), and slightly bulkier head than other light or medium horses, broader chest, "cow hocks" which is when the back legs are spaced closer together- which prevented the loss of crops when drafts were used on farms regularly. And a ticker mane and tail. When mixed though, it can be very hard to tell if the horse does in fact have draft in it. From the picture, it's hard to tell if she does in fact have draft in her, or if she's just more of a "working" QH, built for ranch working and such, unlike the more "Racing" QH who tend to be slimmer and abit taller.     I would say that it is a possibility, though i'm not entirely sure since i'm not a pro at telling horse breeds. Plus, there are some rare cases that a horse never truly looks like it's breed "standard". My friend own a Chincoteague pony-straight off the island and all, but he's almost 16hh, the average height being around 13h.|`|rGhPsn7Maa	quarter horses are supposed to be really buff horses,  i have seen some really muscular ones that are full QH, that's just how they are, well from the angle of the pic i couldn't really tell if he has any draft in him, from the camera angle it didn't really look like he has any, but there could always be a possibility, if you don't want to do a DNA test then why don't you do your own research- look up his bloodlines in his registration (if he is registered) if not then do a little back tracking ask the old owners if they know of any draft in him, also if they don't and there were other owners before them then keep looking and asking until you find the people that had him (they should know what kind of horses they bread to get him) there is a possibility but im not 100% sure if he has any in him. well best of luck-|`|AA10776535	Doesn't look like he does to me.|`|IhjFjoKDaa	You have a quarter horse. They're MEANT to be muscular. Every horse has a little hair around their fetlock - that's all the horse in the picture has.    Sorry to disappoint you - but no - you have a plain, jane, totally boring sorrel quarter horse.|`|meoRbjgCaa	though he may be "buff" I don't believe his bones are dense or wide enough to be a draft.

JsBb732Maa	They are not the same thing, we have flying squirrels native here and not sugar gliders.|`|I2aoh7OMaa	no.|`|qXff2v4qaa	they are not the same at all!  sugar gliders are marsupials and flying squirrels are rodents.  i don't think they look alike either.  sugar gliders are generally black and white (with color variations possible) and flying squirrels are varying shades of brown with a white underbelly.  the only things that look alike about them are their membranes used for flying and their big eyes that let them see at night.  sometimes people mistakenly call sugar gliders flying squirrels, and flying squirrels sugar gliders, but they are definitely very different animals.  and as far as being pets, there are lots of differences there too.
66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	Your vet should have provided you with aftercare instructions.  A little swelling is normal, but you must keep the area clean to ward off infection.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	There is normal swelling with spays & I wouldn't worry unless very large or looks infected. It's tough to keep up them  calm afterwards since they bounce back so quick but try for a day or two & no jumping up & down off of furniture.  Keep in a crate if you have to.|`|ZCeZ6hNJaa	Redness and irritation are normal within reason. If your ***** (meaning that in the kindest way) is licking excessively, then you will need to attach an 'e' collar to her head. This will stop any licking and thus irritation.    Feel free to add a bit of Neosporin or other antibiotic ointment if the dog cannot lick it off. Also, dogs can have a reaction to the anesthetic.     Try to leave it through the evening, preferably with an 'e' collar, and see how it is in the morning. These surgical sites usually work themselves out overnight and reduce swelling on their own.    Have your pup sleep in with you tonight to keep an eye.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	It could be nothing or she could be allergic to the sutures.  She also could have pulled at the suture area.  Try not to allow her to go wild and pull the suture area.  She shouldn't be running and jumping for at least 5 days.  If she's too hyper then you need to confine her...put her in a crate or a room where she can't hurt herself.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	It's probably a seroma.  This is usually fluid build up at the incision site.  Try and keep your dog calm to help heal and let the seroma go down.  If you don't change your pups activity level, it will continue to swell and may open the incision again.
lhOd2hvXaa	We have used litter box training with our puppies with great success. It's great when they are really young and, as in situations like yours, where the cold weather makes housebreaking difficult.    You basically follow the same steps you would for housebreaking but take them over to the litter box instead of taking them outside. We use the Second Nature Litter and litter box.    The nice thing about this litter is that when it's warmer you can take a handful of it outside and put it on the grass where you want your pup to potty and they will quickly associate the smell.    Good Luck!|`|EeJMITyCaa	Pick one of the other or your dog will never learn. If you Parson terrier is under 40 pounds then just go on and use a litter box. It works basicaly the same way you teach your dog to go outside. Crate him in a crate that is just big enough for her to turn around in and stand up comfortably. While she is 2 months then every 2-3 hours take her out and put her in the litter box and don't let her get out or play with the litter. She may whine because she doesn't think she is supposed to go in the litter box (maybe she laid in it and thinks it comfortable) it may take hours. You maybe have to take 15 minute shifts with other family  members but eventually she will be. She can't hold it forever, especially being in the rate for 2 hours as a puppy When she goes praise her and treate her. She will eventually love to go in the litter box!

66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	Put her in the crate, wait 10-15 min and let her out.  Put her in the crate, wait 10-15 min, go into another room where she can't see you for 5 min and let her out. Slowly increase the time she can't see you until she reaches 20 min where she can't see you and let her out. This can't all be done in a day. It'll take several days, maybe weeks.  Next, Put her in the crate, wait 10-15 min, go into another room where she can't see you for 20 min, then leave the house for a minute. Then come back and let her out. Slowly increase that minute outside the house until you reach 10+ minutes.     Every time you let her out, reward her for good behavior in the crate. Do not reward bad behavior. If she doesn't behave, start over and shorten your times. It's going to take some time and perseverance on your part, but she will improve slowly, and she'll eventually catch on.|`|RvddYKqjaa	She was probably mistreated and caged. You don't know why she was up for adoption? Whether she was taken from someone?  It could be she was trained for fighting, as so many are.   I guess you need to be patient with her. She may be remembering some pretty bad trauma.|`|QzM6YJxyaa	Its very possible she has an aversion to cages.  If you got her from a rescue shelter she may associate cages with being abandoned, since most SPCA's and humane societies cage the animals that are waiting for adoption.      If you must use a crate, then you should make it her everyday resting spot.  Put her blankets into the crate and leave it open so she can wander in and out throughout the day when you are home.  She needs to learn its a safe place to relax (a mini home), rather than a constrictive metal box she's forced into every time you go out.     Few dogs like when their owner leaves, especially when  one owners already abandoned them.  If the dog only associates their crate with you leaving them, they'll see it as negative and act out.|`|JsBb732Maa	Do you have a really good bone for her to chew? It's sounds like she's bored not scared. Try a knuckle bone, they are a cow bone and good for dogs to chew and last a long time. Has she torn up a Plastic kennel? Like a vari kennel? It might be a little harder for her to get a hold of something.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Heck yea. I would get anew dog.

Take her for a long walk or run and get her good and tired before you confine her. Take the edge off a little bit.|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	holy crap, sounds like you need a new dog.     Its harder to crate train an older dog.|`|HKoo2PfYaa	I love M&M's!    I had the same issue with my dog, if your dog doesn't like cages then don't force him/her into one. This can actually make them aggressive to you!     Another thing that you can do is take him/her to your vet and ask the question - perhaps have him or her see what the dog does when at the vet (have him or her cage the dog)...    I would recommend leaving the crate open during the day so that he or she can go in it freely and feel safe - you want to make this seem like it is their true "home".  After time the dog should appreciate it and take care of it - and not chew himeself or herself out every time you leave!    Good luck and patience is everything :)|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Some people worry that crate confinement is cruel, but if you do it right, your dog won't see it that way at all. His crate can be a cozy den where he retreats from household chaos or just relaxes. And once he's housetrained, your dog will have the run of the house as well as a nice little den of his own--just leave the door open for him.  here are some guidelines:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=916027511653...    hope this helps.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	do you have a small bathroom which you could ptu all stuff up or something like that. i mean this dog was probably treated pretty bad and you have to start very carefully. imean yes a crate is good but when the dog is one year old its hard to start now. i would try and get a bed or blanket or something he can call his and use it for bedding. they you hae to lay it down where you want him to rest and put him in there once he learns this it willb e easier. so a bathroom or something that is small would be best for him to stay in. goo dluck|`|8DKNAn0iaa	um well yeah try tiring her out first and put her in only when necessery     when my dog was younger, at first at night he would have to go in the crate. But he kept crying and it kept everyone awake. He would pee in it bite it and yeah.   Then we put my dads old jeans in it and he fell asleep on it.  Shes still young, she probubly doesint want to be alone . Put something that has your sent on it. Try that ?

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Over-the-counter de-wormers like you get at Walmart don't work.  What you need to do is take  a stool sample to your vet so your vet can get you the correct de-wormer for the type of worms your puppy has.  Also, in the correct dosage for your puppy's weight.  It's also very important to give the de-wormer when the vet tells you to so you kill all the worms because they lay eggs inside your puppy - you need to get those, too once they've hatched.      And if this puppy was let go by his breeder without any shots, he needs to get to a vet immediately - he hasn't got any protection from parvo and parvo kills.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Most likely these are roundworms. Puppies that are unvaccinated can easily get these. You need to get him to the vet very soon so that he can get a worm diagnosis test and a treatment. Then just make sure that you are treating your dogs for worms to prevent them from getting them again. Some types of the parasites can kill your dog.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	no,no no!    Take him to the vet immediately!    That can be very dangerous to his immune system,    Imagine how horrible it must be to poop worms.     make an appointment A.S.A.P.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Yes he Has WORMS take him to the vet or try to Deworm him youself it usally works. If he needs his first shots Take him to the vet they will give him Sure to work wormer, checkup and first shots for like 30$. P.S you'll need to find out what kind of worms he has there are many different kinds Like- Tape worms,heart worms, Roundworms.    Hope this helps|`|rUMlDAINaa	Your puppy probably has a touch of coccidia, which is to say that he has some worms working in his system and it is not abnormal for this to happen, especially when you have introduced him to a new environment and he's feeling a little stressed.    I would stay away from do it yourself wormers while your puppy is this young. The vet will give you some tablets to give the puppy that will help expel the worms - but expect to go through this perhaps a couple of times while he's still young.    Some things to avoid, especially while your puppy's immune system is not fully developed and before he's had all his shots: taking him to crowded places like pet stores where there could be other dogs there that are sick or not immunized; taking him to dog parks - for the same reason; taking him to use the bathroom in places where other dogs have defecated and potentially transmitted disease or where worm larvae his growing (most often, in the decomposing feces of other animals).    This early time in your puppy's life is one to spend the extra time and money exercising caution. Check out the link - I hope it's helpful.|`|JsBb732Maa	Were the worms long or short like rice? To deworm him you need to know what type he has. If they were long it sounds like a round worm, short rice looking that's a tape worm. He should have already had his first shots, they usual schedule is 6-9-12 weeks. Then yearly, if you worm him your self look for Nemex or Evict. It's a liquid wormer that works fine, I've used it on my puppies for years.When they go for their first well puppy care they've always been parasite free. Look for the dose, it's 5cc per 10  of body weight. He needs his shots asap.|`|vJP6yTy3aa	yes,  take him to the vet.  do NOT de-worm him yourself|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You could just take a stool sample in to your Vet and have them test it for what kind of worms they are.  If you are seeing them in the stool it's normally roundworms, they are long and spaghetti-like.  But the Vet should be able to test the stool and dispense the proper meds to clear up your puppys poo.
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	First of all, no--a properly taken care of ferret would NOT stink up your basement.    Second of all, when there is no one there to supervise the ferret, I would not recommend leaving him even in a playpen; he really should be up in the cage (and, with your schedule, two would be better.  It would allow the ferts to have companionship all day.  Not just when you get home).    Ferrets need 4-6 hours out a day.  Half of that time should be spent with you and a wide selection of toys (groups of toys that you can switch out every few days works the best).    Do not give the ferts frequent baths.  Every 3-4 months is sufficient.  Clean the cage everyday.  Clean fert laundry every week.  Feed a high quality food.  Here's a chart to help: http://mdferretpaws.org/care/food_treats...    Join forums, read books, read online articles.  Believe me, there is a lot of info out there for you to read.    I'm kinda iffy on the basement thing, actually.  In a way it's great--it always them quiet time and a nice, dark place to sleep.  But, conversely, they need to feel like they are a part of the house, as well.  If you can spend 3-4 hours down there with them, then I'd say it's fine :)    Yes, you *can* bond deeply with an adopted or older ferret.  When I first got into ferrets, we had two.  My mom had one (Pixie) and I had one (Yew).  Gradually, my mom gave Pixie to me.  I, initially, resented her and didn't really like her (I still took care of her and made sure she was healthy, but I didn't love her and she barely tolerated me.  There is *never* a good reason for neglecting ANY animal, no matter what you may feel).  It wasn't until she was about 1.5 years old that we bonded.  Suddenly, she was the best little girl, and now I don't know what I'd do without her.  Those aren't the best circumstances for any animal to live in.  They all have a right to be loved and adored by their owners, but even like that, ferrets are forgiving and human-oriented critters.    Spend time around ferrets.  Know what you will be doing every day for the next 6-8 years and then decide if a ferret (or better yet--two or three) is right for you.    If you want, I do have a blog that is comprised of living with ferrets.  It contains their antics AS WELL AS the boring day-to-day stuff that everyone has to do when they become ferrents.  It's over at: http://www.sunnyberrasferrets.blogspot.c...   if you want to take a look.    Good luck.|`|44kEtDvIaa	It won't make your basement stink if taken care of properly.  Most owners that have odor problems didn't do their research and haven't properly taken care of the ferrets needs.  Would not suggest leaving it to run free unless the basement is really ferret-proofed.  He's okay in the cage and will sleep the day away.  Like any pets, they will bond with you even when adopted, just might take a bit longer.  And ferrets are a bit stubborn to litter train.  Suggest checking site below as has good info on ferrets plus ferret links .. you'll get what you need to know about these great pets!|`|fEBOzWeXaa	Ferrets are only box trained if there happens to be a box in every corner......  That being said, they are a hoot.  We have had several and all were adopted and they are very affectionate, (some anyway) and funny.  They chatter and talk and laugh and play a lot.  They will get into everything and carry it around or hide under it.  The first one we had was when all 4 of my kids were teenagers and they took him for walks on a leash, wearing a little harness.  He would steal the girls hair ties and stash them under the sofa, socks, ditto with the sofa.  I have a photo of one of my daughters posing in her prom dress.  She looks demented because the ferret was jumping around under the long skirt, playing with her legs and slip.  Some are biters, our first one was and we never could break him of it.  Bare toes was his thing and anyones were fair game.  The second one was a real sweetie and a cuddler and never ever bit.  Have fun but remember, they do stink, no matter what you do.  And they do need grooming, nail trimming, baths, frequent litter changes and lots of affection and interaction.|`|I12vnNlsaa	you know that it will make your basement stink right?????  i dont think you should leave the cage open unless u train him really good he might get into things. and they let you go on the internet or email in school?  ferrets are sooo cute though
TpOVmqpHaa	While breeding so closely was more common in years past, it's no longer very well accepted.  While your mom may have no problem with it, it's likely most potential puppy buyers who know anything about pedigrees, will.  I suggest you do some research on pedigrees and note how often you see the same dog in the pedigree.  You will see them, for sure, BUT, they will be further back in the pedigree.    You can get on some JRT discussion boards, and also check out the pedigree database here:  http://www.pedigreedatabase.com/dogs/jac...    Your best bet is for your female to be at least 2 yrs old before being bred, and then, only to a high quality male with a common ancestor no less than 3 generations back on each side.|`|W0buucLsaa	Well, ask her if she thinks that it would be a good idea for you and this uncle to have children, because that would be the same thing, genetically speaking.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	well that would make him a nephew and really it isn't that bad BUT ..are the dogs registered? have they been vet checked? have they been checked for diseases or genetic problems?

That's like your mom and you (if you're a guy) having kids.  It's just not right.  It can cause loads of problems with the puppies.      Plus, even if you for some odd reason do let the dogs mate....you would be creating poorly bred puppies that have lots of problems (vet bills), and you're creating unwanted puppies.  Simple solution....get the dogs fixed.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	Have your dog fixed and then you don't have to worry about explaining anything to your mother.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Inbreeding should not be done unless you have full knowledge of the pedigrees, know all health issues and faults, and genetic health tests have been done on all dogs..  you also need to have a full understanding of genetics.    Inbreeding and line breeding can otherwise create unhealthy puppies..  even dogs that are 25% related.. there is still a high chance that the dogs could both carry genes for the same faults and defects.|`|I2aoh7OMaa	People think that if you in-bread dogs that the puppies will come out with 8 legs or two heads! LOL! On rare occasions this happens when lets say you breed a Stud with his offspring. I would say its better safe then sorry though. You can find a male Jack Russel in the news paper for cheap!|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	Inbreeding is not good, I agree with you.     Some kinds of physical deformities are as a result of close inbreeding. This is a method of 'fixing' sought after characteristics in the breeding population. Unfortunately, it also leads to less genetic variation and increases the chances of invalid young. This is nature's way of preventing successive inbreeding among family groups. You should approach the American Kennel Club and seek out other breeders and showers for their expert opinion.    The extent of inbreeding in purebred dogs and how this reduces their genetic variation is revealed in a new study by Imperial College London researchers. Inbreeding puts dogs at risk of birth defects and genetically inherited health problems|`|Bz9wAaZpaa	This type of ignorance is why dogs die in shelters and on the street everyday. It is sad that you are contributing.   To your mother : DO NOT BREED! There is no good reason, especially when you can't even be bothered to do the proper research.
w13meRXRaa	yes, in fact, bettas and fish have internal ears and are VERY sensitive to vibrations and sound.  Putting speakers by youtr fish could stress it out.  Even a small tap on the bowl could hurt their ears badly.  They are sensitive, if you really want to put them by the bowl, then i suggest try leaving the volume on low so that it wont have any affect on the fish, take care :)|`|45Cbtd7raa	yes and take out the bowl|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	it might add stress.     Bettas need atleast 2.5 gallons and a heater|`|AA11708471	The speakers will stress him  but not as much as that stupid bowl will    These are living animals people not decorations! the least you could give him is a 5 gallon tank with a filter and a heater!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Yes, so will being kept in a bowl.|`|07lCZh28aa	Yes, you can stress the poor thing out and soon it will die from the stress.
5750c8ed6e36c08baa63c0651369908eaa	Here's an article I just wrote last month for my free horse newsletter, which goes out monthly to all Liverystable.net members:  ______________________________________...    STILL TRYING TO SELL?      The current status of the horse market, economy issues, and time of year make it a tough time to try to sell a horse.  If you are discouraged with trying to sell your horses, here are a few points to consider.     Quality advertising is so important.  Getting your horse's photo in front of interested buyers should be a high priority.  Purchasing a featured ad on Liverystable.net puts your horse at the most visible spot on our homepage, and the cost is miniscule when you add up the feed and boarding bills associated with keeping your horse another several months.    Another aspect to consider is how valuable your horse is.  People are buying and selling horses every day, what could you do to boost an interest in your horse?  Winter is a great time to send a horse to a trainer.  With quality training in your horse's credentials, buyers will be more likely to choose him over others with less training.  There are also things you can brush up on yourself--does your horse load easily in a trailer?  Stand to tie, good with his feet, lead well, bathe well, ride well?  Work on the little details that will make your ad description sound perfect.  Buyers are interested in the small things, too.  ____________________________________    Hopefully this article will give you some tips.  In response to your direct questions:    $1500 sounds like a good asking price for a horse with her experience.  You can always come down a few hundred if a really good buyer comes along and makes an offer.  Five years ago she would have been worth twice that, but today's market is terrible.    Good websites with free photos ads?  To me, Liverystable.net is the best, and I'll email you a free code that will give you six photos on your ad at no charge.    Tips for advertising?  Write a big description and fill in all the details you can about your horse.  Your description here is really good, but buyers are going to want to see photos or they won't even respond.  Photos from the side with her standing square are the best.  If a buyer can't clearly see her feet, legs, and overall conformation, he's going to shake his head and click on the next ad.    If you're making a video, make sure your camera-man can be steady.  No one wants to get dizzy watching a bouncy camera.  Also, do it in good lighting.  Not indoors, unless the lighting is great.  Then, just put her through her paces, and some standing-still conformation poses would be nice, too, if you can work them in.    Good luck with selling her.  She sounds like a valuable horse, and I think there are a lot of people wanting good riding horses...it's the unbroke unregistered ones nobody will take.  I will email you that code for posting free photo ads on Liverystable.net.    Anyone else out there want free photo ads on a great horse website?  Email me.    **Edit:  You don't allow email, so I guess if you want a free code you need to email me first, with your email address.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	It's a good ad, but cut out some unnceccesarry information.  Don't worry about talking about her gaits.  tell that to them in the phone calls/e-mails you will end up with.  She's probably worth 2000.  I'd pay that much or more.  Maybe put 2500 OBO.  Internet ads- equine.com  equinehits.com  horsetopia.com  dreamhorse.com    Thats the best ones.  For videos.  Do riding, leading, picking up her hooves. All that fun stuff!  Pictures- Front view (tip of ears to bottom of hooves) hind view (top of rump to bottom of hooves!)  side (whole horse)  Okay thats about it!|`|qI6oPzA0aa	just like someone els said: put her up as many places as possible, she sounds like she will sell good, try putting up some adds in the newspaper, or flyer's up at your local tack/ feed stores. also the internet helps in some cases too, try different things and i'll bet you will get answers back soon;-) good luck!|`|14PrlLjFaa	Put her ad up EVERYWHERE you can, and be prepared for a long wait, and willing to lower her price if needed. This is about the worst time to sell.....no one is really having any luck, and its very rarely that people are able to sell their horses for what they are worth.  One good site is Dreamhorse.com, although there are hundreds of such sites. Put ads up in your local feed stores as well!     Well, good luck.
Oe2davbxaa	yes, depending on weather, and its fatigue level, but call a vet and ask for help if necessary|`|YOGPspsgaa	Ohhh.... he's dead. :[            Nahh I don't really think so.. Well I don't know.. have you tried moving it..? Because I've heard they sleep for like 3 hours?...|`|VWybtG9Kaa	Mice are nocturnal rodents, so it is normal for them to sleep in the day and come out at dusk.|`|xyPpruSjaa	I agree with Cat. Mice are nocturnal, so usually they sleep for a lot of the day.       Email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com if you have any questions on hamsters, mice, gerbils, and rats, or if you just wanna talk :D
CkecSp4Uaa	If you need legal advice on a dog bite then you need to contact a lawyer who knows the dog laws in your area.  Laws regarding dog bites vary so greatly from one community to another that someone else who has had the exact same thing happen might have a totally different legal outcome.  The real problem here is that it is probably going to come down to your word vs hers.  Since the bite happened on private property that you both share there was no leash law violation.  Frankly if I were in your shoes I would not have allowed the other dog to interact with my dog with the history of the other dog biting like that.  Every dog has a bite threshold...a point at which they can't take any more and they bite back.  It wasn't fair to your dog to put him in that situation again and again and ultimately he paid the price for your mistake.  You might try pointing out to her that her dog had a history of attacking your dog and that your dog was defending himself in this interaction.  You might also point out that you got rid of your dog because she was unable to control her dog.|`|p7swtBYzaa	The only one who lost here is your poor dog who got dumped at the Humane.  If you both had socialized your dogs properly and supervised, he'd still have a home and there would have been no issue.  Hope he gets adopted soon - don't much care what you two irresponsible people decide - the dog lost.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Sounds like your roommate needs to train her dogs to be better behaved.  It's a shame your dog had to given up.  She's responsible for her dog's actions but sadly the same goes for you and your dog.  You may want to offer to pay some of the costs but she shouldn't get off "scott-free".  Or maybe you could offer to pay for some obedience training for her dog.|`|Bw18seFqaa	you are both 50% responsible for the damages..  her dog may have started it, but you were both responsible for supervising and training each of your dogs.|`|b4NcFBhraa	Technically, if her dog didn't cause damage to YOUR dog then yes. If he did cause damage then fair is square, and no. It's all under circumstances. You shouldn't have gotten rid of the dog, you should have just scolded the dog and told the girl that her dog needs to be placed in a better home w/ only an owner, no dogs. Legally she can get you in court, but if you round up a good story, charges can be forced against her.|`|8AHUuhbvaa	well don't put your face near the dog's face and tell your roommate to control his animal. but at the same time, unless he told you to surrender the dog, then it wasn't your job.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	well i would offer half the money  if she takes you to court i hope your other roomies will have your back|`|oiBGMHcBaa	OMG!  Please adopt your dog again!  You dog just defended himself and she has more fault that you do!  Her dog always bit him until he got tired of it!  Eventually he would have got tired of it! You tell that woman that her dog was the one that started it and that he eventually had ot get tired of her dog biting him!  I would have never ever turned in my dog in! You can clearly see that your dog has NO issues the other one has! He might have rabies or something! If I would you I would have showed her a piece of my mind!  Good Luck

2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	"Coprophagia" is the term used to describe the practice of animals eating either their own or other animal's feces.  Inadequate nutrition is one reason for this behavior, but not enough exercise is as well.  If this behavior does not occur often, you needn't be overly concerned.|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	Yes, its more than likely a lack of nutrients. This happens especially in the winter, when horses are needing that extra amount too keep them fat and healthy|`|LAXxaxAZaa	This is very common in animals. You're right... it means they're not getting enough of the minerals and nutrients they need. Try switching grain or putting them on a supplement.
KeQOHakpaa	From all the things you have listed i have to recommend an Akita. they are really big, from 90-140lbs, generally will get along with cats; mine gets along with all my cats (4 cats and my akita loves to play with them, but is just a gentle giant and hates it when they fight with each other), akita's loves to see other people and will lick you to death. Akita's love walks, ours goes for 2 long walks just about every day, and will definitely be able to protect you, but definately don't train them that way, believe me they will already understand when someone is a bad person compared to a friend. when people realize you have an akita, they know to stay away. my boy is left at home everyday for about 6-7hrs. and doesn't mind it at all, usually he just sleeps or plays with his toys (we have never had our akita tear anything up furniture wise). as well most akita's are relatively quiet, but there are some who will bark a lot, though ours just about never talks unless we're playing with him or if a ups man comes. as well akita's love affection, they will great you everyday when you get home without fail, just about bulldozing you over trying to give kisses, but they don't constantly need attention either. they are perfectly ok with just chillin' at home. with the right training, akita's are the best dogs out there, they just need to understand from an early age who's boss.     so after my rant, i'm going to say from what you have posted i would go with a swiss mountain dog, but i still highly recommend getting an akita!|`|8AHUuhbvaa	the swiss mountain dog is great if you're willing to groom it.  they, as well as great danes also drool a lot, but i love em still :)|`|Gh2jzOHYaa	http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...      heree ya goo =]|`|bQH9jLoqaa	Husky always go with a Husky.

tPGxPDvBaa	Better quality food & adding fish oil will help. Brushing daily will help more.  The hair in the brush isn't hair elsewhere. Read these 2 sites for a better info for finding a better choice of food.  SD is mostly fillers than food. This one shows you how to rate food for yourself & what to avoid.    http://www.acreaturecomfort.com/ratingpe...    http://dogfoodchat.com/dog-food-ratings/  This one will show you the rating for dog foods.|`|pQCnXoleaa	Assuming that your dog is healthy, and has no thyroid issues, start with changing dog food. Feed a better quality food. Try something without grain. Be sure that this dog is  not stressed for some reason. Maintain a regular exercise program. If you are bathing this dog yourself, it is important that you use a quality shampoo, something that will not clog pores. Also, make very, very certain that you rince out ALL the shampoo. Continue brushing as before, being careful not to "rake" the skin. Don't forget, most breeds shed, and most will shed more at certain times of the year, or during stress, heat cycles, or from some physiological problem.
n4pNNcGfaa	If you are disabled and your dog is individually trained to perform tasks that mitigate your disability, then you say,    "I'm disabled and this is my service dog which I require because of my disability.  The Americans with Disabilities Act protects my right to enter those areas of businesses which are open to the public accompanied by my service animal.  You can confirm this yourself by calling the U.S. Department of Justice at their toll-free ADA hotline.  The number is 800 - 514 - 0301."    Be aware that the restaurant or other business has a right to ask you what your dog is trained to do to mitigate your disability, but not specifically about your disability itself.  If you do not answer when asked what your dog is trained to do, or if your dog behaves inappropriately (disruptive, threatening or out of control), then the restaurant or other business has the right to have the animal removed from their premises, but they must still serve you without your service animal.    ---edit---    Correcting misinformation...    The ADA is a federal civil law.  It is not enforced by local police.  It is enforced by civil suit which might be filed by the U.S. Department of Justice based on a series of complaints about the same business, or by the individual who faced discrimination if there aren't enough complaints to get the Department to act.  Some states have criminal laws on discrimination that the police can enforce, but most do not.  Check with your state's attorney general to find out if your state has such a law on the books.    If the answer above doesn't resolve the problem, your best bet is to leave and file a complaint with your state's human rights commission, your state's attorney general, or the U.S. Department of Justice.  Generally the ensuing investigation will result in an apology and change in policy.|`|sfLSWEiMaa	Kirsten is right... read her answer....do realize that you are not likely to get much support from the local police, sometimes officers are very aware of how the law applies to SDs and might tell the restaunt owner/manager that they HAVE to allow you, other times they are just as mislead as the public and might threaten to arrest you for criminal trespass for refusal to leave the premises after being informed to leave. I have witnessed several ocassions while accompanying a disabled individual and a S.D. where a store or restaraunt manager will not back down no matter what, and once where one was misinformed by a health inspector that was telling restaraunts that ONLY seeing eye dogs are allowed ( I personally tracked down THAT health inspector and had quite a chat with her boss, cured that problem...)     -Be eloquent but firm in stating that IF they intend to deny you access you will report them to the enforcing body that governs handicapped access, the Department of Justice...but understand they are NOT open 24/7 (BTW option 7 if memory serves right ) so you will probably not be able to reach them on a cell phone while you are actually having the problem... handing someone a printout (with the URL of a reputable source like "ada.gov" or from your local state gov pages, not just something that was typed up) MIGHT be of help but dont expect it to be well recieved... having an ID tag for your service dog with itsy bitsy tiny text on the back is not much help either... learn to quote the law in a very calm assertive matter of fact tone and hope that the other party is not bullheaded. IF they are, document everything, names, hopefully you have a witness,  time, *exactly* what was said, and  report them.....the DOJ will help them find it in their hearts to be nicer to the next person.....    ...honey and vinegar.... if honey doesnt work, use a firehose fulla vinegar by reporting them, the DOJ will straighten them out... especially if theres more than one complaint...of course there is youtube, a witness might videotape the incident and post if for the world to see and if the DOJ was told where they could view it..... not that Im suggesting that anyone accompanying you flip the old cameraphone to video mode  and zoom in on their face,  if you should ever have a problem.....    quoted directly from : http://www.ada.gov/svcanimb.htm    U.S. Department of Justice  Civil Rights Division  Disability Rights Section       Americans with Disabilities Act    ADA Business BRIEF: Service Animals    Service animals are animals that are individually trained to perform tasks for people with disabilities such as guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling wheelchairs, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, or performing other special tasks. Service animals are working animals, not pets.     Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), businesses and organizations that serve the public must allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals into all areas of the facility where customers are normally allowed to go. This federal law applies to all businesses open to the public, including restaurants, hotels, taxis and shuttles, grocery and department stores, hospitals and medical offices, theaters, health clubs, parks, and zoos.    Caption: Businesses that serve the public must allow people with disabilities to enter with their service animal.    Businesses may ask if an animal is a service animal or ask what tasks the animal has been trained to perform, but cannot require special ID cards for the animal or ask about the person's disability.    People with disabilities who use service animals cannot be charged extra fees, isolated from other patrons, or treated less favorably than other patrons. However, if a business such as a hotel normally charges guests for damage that they cause, a customer with a disability may be charged for damage caused by his or her service animal.    A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the animal is out of control and the animal's owner does not take effective action to control it (for example, a dog that barks repeatedly during a movie) or (2) the animal poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.    In these cases, the business should give the person with the disability the option to obtain goods and services without having the animal on the premises.    Businesses that sell or prepare food must allow service animals in public areas even if state or local health codes prohibit animals on the premises.    A business is not required to provide care or food for a service animal or provide a special location for it to relieve itself.    Allergies and fear of animals are generally not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people with service animals.    Violators of the ADA can be required to pay money damages and penalties.    If you have additional questions concerning the ADA and service animals, please call the Department's ADA Information Line at (800) 514-0301 (voice) or (800) 514-0383 (TTY) or visit the ADA Business Connection at ada.gov.    Duplication is encouraged. April 2002|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	A service dog can go any where you go.  That is the law!  Tell them that they will be reported.    Here are a couple websites that should be helpful.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Go to the website on ADA to check for rules but as long as your dog is a registered service dog they can't deny you or ask what your illness is that requires a service dog.  You can report them & call police if needed.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	You tell them that you will take your business somewhere else and also inform them that service dogs are allowed anywhere and you will be reporting them to the approriate people.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	I would then ask to use their phone to call your lawyer or better yet the MEDIA..then they might think twice about being ignorant to someone and their dog..|`|QVP8zSuWaa	As long as you had the dogs service dog  ID and/or had a vest, you should have called the cops.

Many restaurants would get in trouble for letting animals inside.  It is unfortunate but if i were you i would let it go and pick another place to eat.  they probably feel pretty bad for having to deny a disabled person service.
44kEtDvIaa	Other than some olden native use for hides and their claws and teeth as ornamentan decoration, I don't believe they have any commercial use.  They are beautiful animals and an important part of our nature system.

6RqjxUTnaa	The question if dogs are colorblind, specifically red-green colorblind or if dogs only see shades of gray is raised among dog owners quite often. Even on the internet the question concerning dog vision is discussed controversial. But there is a simple answer to that question which I would like to share with you supported by some scientific resources.    Actually there are two distinct questions which I would like to ask, answer and set in relation hereafter:    Can dogs see colors?  Answer: Yes   Are dogs colorblind?  Answer: Yes   Let me explain this two answers to you a bit more in detail.    Dogs can see colors  Dogs not only see in shades of gray but also can see distinct colors contrary to what most people belief. About one hundred years ago some scientific tests were made to find out more about the color vision of dogs. But these tests werent that scientific as they thought and the researchers concluded only that color vision doesnt play a part in the daily life of a dog.    Only about 90 years later distinct researches have shown that dogs can perceive colors. Neitz, Geist and Jacobs researched in 1989 the color vision of domestic dogs and found the following facts:    Dogs have two different color receptors in their eyes and therefore are dichromats.   One color receptor peaks at the blue-violet range, the other at the yellow-green range.   Conclusion: Dogs are green-blind which is one form of red-green color blindness also called deuteranopia.   This results were support by later researches of Jacobs with colleagues in 1993 and Miller and Murphy in 1995.     Dogs are colorblind  This directly leads us to the second question concerning the color blindness of dogs. Colorblind doesnt relate to not see any colors but describes the fact that you cant see the same color range as somebody with normal vision. Because of that any kind of color vision deficiency is called color blindness. Therefore dogs are colorblind because of their dichromatic color vision.    Colors dogs cant distinguish  Actually the color spectrum made up of wavelengths of light is the same to all of us. Only the perception of those colors can be quite different. As dogs only have two different color receptors in their eyes they have problems to distinguish certain colors:    Red  Orange  Green   Greenish Blue  Gray   Different shades of Purple   The list is not completed and there are a lot of different shades which cant be differentiated if you are colorblind. And the conclusion is dogs can see colors but are at the same time colorblind.    hope this helps|`|5hb6VUglaa	To make it short, sweet, and to the point, dogs can see dark blue, gray black, dark purple, and more dark colors. But no one will ever know.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	No one knows 100% and no one ever will, because we can't see what dogs see like, so we will never fully know.
A3g0rrTXaa	hehe.. I have that saddle. Doesn't fit either of my horses but it was like $10 at a garage.     I would call it an old style all purpose saddle. 30ish years ago (or less), no one used knee role. They are NOT completely necessary to jump correctly. I would be one of the many dying due to the lack of a knee role but it is completely possible to jump without them. My mother fox hunted in a saddle just like that, which is why I have mine. She jumped at buying it because she HATES knee roles. Now that I've restated that ts possible to jump in a saddle without knee roles a bunch of times l continue.     I would definitly say that this saddle is usable if:  - the tree is 100% ok  - it fits your horse  - it fits you  - its safe (no cracks, ect)    Besides that, it looks good to me. Have fun on the team! I loved mine!    EDIT: reading other peoples answers... I kind of feel like the second picture makes the flap look straighter than it actually is. If you have the money, I would invest in a nice forward flap jumping saddle with knee roles but I still don't see anything about this saddle that screams unsutible|`|pnDZcQKpaa	i don't think that it would be very good... i would get an all purpose, so that you can properly go into jump position with out a flat saddle flap to "restrict" you. an all purpose saddle has a forward cut flap, so it's easier to go into two-point.  hope i helped (:|`|RloOJ43haa	It's really hard to tell from the pictures you posted, but the flap on that saddle does not look like it has a forward enough cut to be suitable for jumping. It looks like an all-purpose with dressage emphasis. I think you would be more comfortable and secure with a jumping saddle for jumping.|`|8AHUuhbvaa	get the all-purpose and a riser pad.  you don't wanna risk hurting your horse's joints or back|`|9LSZfzzxaa	The Stubben saddle you have looks more like a dressage saddle than anything else.  It may  be intended to be all-purpose, but it does not look suitable for jumping.  The reason I say that is the flap is very straight in front, which will prevent you from shortening your stirrups and getting into a proper jumping position.  I would suggest getting a proper jumping saddle, and keeping the saddle you have for dressage work.  Here is an example of a very nice jumping saddle:    http://cgi.ebay.com/CREST-BT-CRUMP-PRIX-...|`|7PAGYzdhaa	YES, you can use this saddle. It won't hurt your horse, or anything like that...that's silly!:P But...it might be a little harder to get up and out of the saddle two fold over the fences. My friend has a more dressagey saddle like that, and she competes in the jumpers JUST FINE. have fun jumping!!!:)  ja-maken me blush|`|LE6Vot7Kaa	That is defiantly a dressage saddle. You can get less expensive used saddles at your local tack shop or on ebay. If you get it off ebay you might want to check with your trainer to make sure it is a good saddle and a good price.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	That looks like a old dressage saddle to me, not a jumping.    Anyways, I would buy a close contact if you plan on jumping. There is a saying "all purpose saddles have no purpose at all" because they are great at putting you *almost* in the correct position, but not quite getting there.|`|L2rivPUWaa	You should really go either all purpose or purchase a jumping saddle if that's what you have in mind.         http://www.horserides.org|`|Wvb08bniaa	Recently, I found dressage saddle in reasonable price at http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c1... . I can't believe I found such a GREAT saddle. Its got a very deep seat that is soft. Grippy buffalo leather on the entire saddle. Adjustable tree, so it fits any horse I decide to use it on. Wool flocked panels, 2" cutback head, and a tall knee roll. Quality of leather is wonderful - broke in like a dream and leather is soft as butter. Such, Best Saddle.
AA10776535	I have had them and have one now BLM out of Nevada.  She is defiantly a draft cross, big as a house.  I have only had her for since friday and i've had the flu since then so i haven't left my bed till now.  I did catch her out in the turnout area friday, she was flirting with a colt and she lead just fine, well see.  Im really not in love with the breed the last one i had was a 5 year old stallion, he gave me a run for my money.|`|r5aokD7Yaa	This will probably be an unpopular answer, but I dislike mustangs.    The ones I've handled are hard headed, inclined to be wary (good idea in the wild, not so much in the barn), not terribly well conformed for my sports of choice (hunter and cutting-- don't ask why I'm into both).    I personally prefer horses which are born to friendly, trusting mothers, are handled from day one, are broke to lead within the first week of life and learn to tie before they're big enough to pull down my barn :)    Worked BLM mustangs in IN and IL.    I did not purchase, but assisted with some "re-training".|`|QGecNxmgaa	Never have owned a mustang or even ridden one so idk why i even answered this because it probably wont help you.    mustang are really wild though, I think it would be hard to train one. if you are looking to buy one I'd say hold off untill you find a professional mustang trainer or when you know more about it.|`|7PAGYzdhaa	I agree wuth m_c_ dilly. I personally don't like them They're not as athletic as others, and they're thick headed. They can be sweet, but they just are NOT my type. They are too small, so if you think you're going to get big, then dont go there. Most people are always saying how majestic and beautiful mustangs are...but ACTUALLY they're NOT most of the ones that I've seen, have jug heads, and are short and aqward. My neighbors have like 4 mustangs when ev I ride my horse down the road, they freak out and start flying around. They're not vert pretty, and they're not very bright...there's not much to like there...sorry they're just NOT me!:)|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	I do not have any experience with mustangs other than knowing a trainer and watching her take her mustang to the Mustang Challenge. But I am shocked to read that "mustangs are not athletic" of course they are they have to survive some how, escaping from predators and living in the harsh environments. They are actually very hardy animals and smart, often will test you.|`|fIbutEBxaa	I adopted a BLM Mustang. He was 4 when I got him.  We gelded him about a month or two after we got him.  He was a bit pushy but I didn't get to spend as much time training him as I would have liked to before I gave him away (due to school and moving to the city).  We rode him and took him camping.  He didn't have a mean bone in his body.  You just have to understand them and how they think in order to train them correctly.  They come from a completely different world than domesticated horses.  Everything is new to them so you have to de-spook them twice as much as a regular horse.  Breaking them is interesting and earning their trust takes the most time.  Some of them are nuts but so are some domestic horses.  So really it has all to do with picking your horse and knowing how to train them and if you can.  They are EXTREMELY smart.  Sometimes too smart!  Every horse is different and the one I had was beautiful.  Conformationally correct (he was 14.3 though!)  but gorgeous when he ran across the field.  Especially in the summer when his bay coat just glistened!|`|9QHzbFSNaa	We have an (almost) 4 year old Mustang mare.  She was originally adopted from the BLM as a yearling but for a couple years was still untamed.  Long story short we got her in June of 08.    In June she was practically untouchable.  We worked and worked and worked with her and she came around quickly.  Come September we were riding her.      Its been a learning experience for both my mom and me.  She is still a stubborn little sh*t at times but is also a very sweet girl.  Stubborn, but at the same time very willing to learn.  She bonded mostly with my mom because she did most of the work with her - as most Mustangs do.      In the future I would like to adopt another Mustang.  It can be a very rewarding experience.  One of the biggest things I don't really care for in them, though, is that they are on the small side.  But thats only because I like BIG horses :-P  Especially our girl, she's little!!!    Here is a pic of her just for fun :-)      http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g226/d...|`|jiWHDyS5aa	My exp personally has been weird...not bad, not good, not anything...    there is no word to describe my mustang....  shes lazy, yet crazy. u can barely get her to trot, yet she will buck you off any chance she gets. also she gallops randomly around her pasture for an hour. but i have never been able to get her to canter(im an exp. rider btw) she wants nothing to do with people, basically ANTI-SOCIAL!! she wont come to you, sometimes even if u have feed. its hell to try to catch her in a larger pasture. she busts out of her pasture and heads down the road(atleast 10 times a year, if we're lucky) one time she made it 15 miles in 2 hours....in the middle of the night...    she hasnt improved at all since we rescued her 2 years ago. i would have never bought this horse. but she was being kept in some guys yard next to a busy 4 lane highway.NO FENCE! he tied her to a post at night....the guy said he took her from a guy that was abusing her....so who knows where she was before...    all i can think is that she was tossed around from bad owner to bad owner after she was adopted thru BLM.(she has papers, so we know for sure)        so if that tells u anything.....|`|aKSicRp9aa	I have a horse whose dam was a blm mustang, but I've never seen her.  I was told he was a buckskin, but he has the dorsal stripe and barring on his legs, so I guess he's actually a dun.  He's also got some blond in his mane and tail so ????  He's 4 and greenbroke, but he's really really really green.  He's cute, but I don't think he has great conformation... actually I really don't know how to judge that, I'm pretty inexperienced.  He's one of those horses that is very curious, he has to look through your pockets and nibble your hair every time you go see him.  also very smart as in can open some gates.  stubborn as a post if he doesn't want to do something.  I've only ridden him a little, but he has really nice gaits, really prancy and easy to ride.  I know that isn't the way to describe it, but that's the best I can do.  and all mustangs are not hammer headed or ugly, I've seen some really beautiful ones in South Dakota.  you can see them on the Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary website.

yP7mVYmqaa	Shih tzus are perfect! Well at least mine is ;)  My fiance got me a shih tzu from a *reputable* breeder.  Kyoki is  2 months old and weighs 1.10 lbs.  He is the love of my life! My shih tzu is VERY sweet, friendly, great with toddlers, knows no strangers.  When he sees new people, he gets very excited.    He was very easy to potty train.  For now, I am training him to go on the puppy pads due to the cold weather outside.  He's been doing it perfectly! When we play downstairs on the carpet, he waits until I put him on the pad before he goes potty.  At first he was whiny and would bark, but I trained him not to do that.  I ignored his whining, so he won't think that whining can get him whatever he wants.  But make sure he's not whining for a reason. Make sure he's not hungry, thirsty, too cold, too hot, etc.      My family is so inlove with him as well.  We all treat him like a baby! But not in a spoiled way, though I spoil him sometimes. LOL! How could I not? He is too adorable.  On the other hand, I am also STRICT.  I train him not to bark and not to bite as much (he's a puppy and teething, so it's normal).  He is also very smart.  He already knows how to sit, jump, come, and sometimes stay. lol!      Shih tzus can sometimes be stubborn, but with proper training, they can be obedient little dogs.  My puppy is not stubborn because I trained him not to be.  Make sure you don't spoil your future puppy too much and let him know that YOU'RE THE BOSS.      You will not regret having a shih tzu puppy.  They are CUTE, fun, and super sweet!      Here is my little angel btw...  http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f348/k...  http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f348/k...    He also loves to be in that bag! It's sometimes hard to take him out of it.  When he sees me take the bag out, he gets super excited!       :)    Good luck girl!  Have fun with your future puppy!!!!|`|tQN4lGKOaa	yessssss they are cute..but very high maintanace dogs..but get a female..males tend to be aggressive at times...least all the male ones i have seen are...females are very sweet natured and they are beautiful lovind animals...very loyal and lap dogs for sure'|`|VQX9e0mxaa	yes i purchased a shih-tzu puppy on january 18th...and he is very sweet...my mom says that theyre slightly stubborn at times. my puppy just follows me around becuz hes still getting adjusted to our home...they are very good natured, and if u just want one as a pet and not a show dog, u dony need to get a purebred. purebreds tend to be slightly unhealthier. u should choose a breeder, altho i got mine from a man whose dog had puppies. shih tzus mostly respond to the sound "ee" so ur puppies name could have the "ee" sound in it. all in all they are sweet dogs who need quite a bit of grooming, are very sweet and loving, and just want to be around a leader, sumone who can take care of him...i personally think shih tzus are great, becuz compared to other dogs, theyre very low maintenance....i barely brush my dogs fur and its fine! or maybe thats just cuz hes not pure....ask if u have more questions!|`|orQM8Xp9aa	Amazing choice.  My first shih tzu was a female that lived to the age of twenty and she was an incredible dog.  Could not have asked for a kinder, more loving or intelligent dog.  I now have another female shih tzu (now 5 months) and she is also an excellent and extremely loving pet.  She is also very intelligent (just graduated puppy school :)).  Also, in my experience depending upon grooming choices they really aren't any worse than other dogs as they don't shed so that's a bonus.  Friends of the family had a male that had food guarding issues... my preference is clearly females.  Anyway, best of luck with whatever you get and I can only hope you have as amazing an experience as I have with the breed.|`|AVfPXkEraa	I have two males and two females, and they are ALL the sweetest most playful little creatures! Batman (our 7 year old male) is still just as playful as when he was a puppy! He is a stud and has never growled at anyone! Honey (our 6 year old female) is the ultimate lap dog! She will do anything for a treat. When I feed them, Batman always makes sure Honey has had her fill before he eats. These are my foster dogs - I am taking care of them for my daughter.  Then there is Mike Honcho, my two year old male. He is our baby. Right now, as I type, he is laying like a baby in my arms, sound asleep (and snoring)! And Carli, our little baby girl, who is almost 1, is just as cuddly as her mommy and brother. I have them bathed every week, and I brush them every day. They are perfect if you want a dog for a true companion. And they are very cute!|`|cUKqmNAlaa	What a great choice!    I have Geordie - a 9 week old male puppy who is adorable and we have no trouble with him at all (expect at night when he takes a wee while to settle to sleep - and that's getting better each night.    He's so friendly and willing to please.    Take a look at his site for more info http://www.loveshihtzu.com      Good luck!
EeJMITyCaa	Heck yea!!! My apartments don't have an on-site manager. Its run by a company called Sealy so I got lucky. I didn't even pay the pet deposit!!! However, the apartments I'm moving to next do have landlords, luckly they have met and love my puppy.|`|um5CVvTfaa	I would NEVER do that (bring in a dog without telling the landlord) because I would be furious if someone did it to me.|`|W0buucLsaa	Um, not a good idea. You'll either be kicked out or your dog will. Worst case, you won't be able to exit the lease agreement but will have to re-home your dog.     Keep looking. Call realty agencies - they often manage properties with more lax owners that only have 1-3 places to rent out. So just find a realtor/property manager or two, and tell them that you need to rent a house/duplex/whatever that allows dogs. They WILL find something for you; the owners of the rental properties pay them for it. (You don't pay them.)|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Hope you plan on losing your deposit.    I did bring a dog into my apartment but I was moving in a week and did not want to pay for more boarding.    She was then sprayed by a skunk, I had to clean her up and keep the odors out of the apartment.  Not an easy task.|`|RrmO1xkuaa	Yes, I had a dog about a year ago and needed to find a place ASAP...but most landlords didn't allow pets and I wasn't willing to part w/ my best buddy. I did take her in, the guy wasn't happy and was constantly finding stuff to complain about - she did this and that...And I kept her mainly in my room. It kind of worked out because this guy was desperate for some rent money and my pet was small - a Jack Russell.  So if you're lucky you  may be able to keep yours. Good Luck!|`|CkecSp4Uaa	No.  Because if your landlord discovers you have a dog when you aren't allowed one they can not only evict you if you don't get rid of the dog but since you were breaking the terms of the lease they are still legally entitled to the remainder of the rent.  So then you and the dog are homeless but still responsible for all of the rent you would have paid through the end of the lease...and all at once rather than in monthly rent payments.  It doesn't matter if the dog is well behaved, non-destructive, and housebroken, if the lease says no pets it means no pets and the landlord can have you evicted for breaking the lease.  It's just not worth the risk.    Being patient and taking the extra time and effort (and money) to find a rental property that allows pets is just part of owning a dog.  I have had pets for 8 years, including dogs, and just this past spring bought my own house.  I understand the frustration of finding a nice place to rent that allows pets (think it's hard with one dog? try doing it with three cats and a dog...or three cats and two dogs) but breaking the terms of the lease and sneaking a pet in when they are prohibited just isn't worth it.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Not a good idea.  you don't want to get settled in and have the landlord find out you have a dog and you end up without a place to live.  Or worse decide the dog must go.  Keep searching.  A dog friendly place is out there!|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	They can evict you, keep your deposit, etc if they find out.       I know a girl who rents out apartments.|`|rx7e4Jogaa	Bringing a dog in to a house is a good way to get evicted, in most states, a major lease violation, which is what this is considered in most states, is terms for a three day eviction.  It's not worth it to lose your place to live, and even if you get rid of the dog before your three days are up, you can still be evicted.  It's not worth it....|`|tLpLEFSjaa	Yes absolutely. My family has never gotten caught, but it is risky because the worst case scenario is that you get evicted if the landlord ever finds out.     I've found that the best thing to do (just in case a neighbor sees the dog, or someone notices that it's there a lot) is to say that you watch a friend or sibling's dog while they're at work during the day, and is it going to be a problem if the dog just stays in the yard? If they seem to get a little uneasy, follow it up with "It's usually just one day a week," so they calm down a little bit.    This is out of order... but it's good to start the conversation with "I noticed that it said 'no pets...'" I did that once, and the guy I was talking to was totally open about it and said it depended on the pet, he loves pets and as long as they're behaved he wouldn't mind. So then I didn't even have to lie. Good luck!|`|715be83c4805c7fabb131dbeeba11eb8aa	I did this once and nearly got kicked out of the apartment.  I bet it's a violation of your rental agreement or contract.  Best to just keep searching so you, and your dog, won't be SOL.
iiNAJfGCaa	He sounds like a typically hard headed lesson pony. Don't base what he does with you against what he does with other riders. I have handled more than my fair share of cranky little lessons ponies. Believe it or not, they often challenge the BETTER riders. They are testing your limitations and seeing how much they can get away with. With less experienced riders the ponies often go into what I like to call a "dead zone" where they just plop around, bored out of their little skulls, just to get the job done. Ask if your instructor can give you some one on one time. Keep riding in the arena until you feel comfortable enough to go out on the trail. If you truly feel that the pony is above your ability, ask to switch on to a more well behaved pony until your riding improves enough that you feel you can handle the other one. Good luck!!|`|DDhsF8zYaa	You know, some horses and riders just don't click.  It might be something about you he doesn't like, or maybe the first time you rode him you had a bad experience, so the second time you freaked out, and it continued on.    Just tell your trainer about the problem and either say I want to step it down and try to fix it, or I don't want to ride this pony any more.|`|7Xkcs9rXaa	i agree with Eight_Belles some riders and horses don't click. i would take some time off of riding that pony. and ride some other horse or pony. once your confidence is back up, you should ride him again. he'll feel that you're in more control and you'll have more faith in yourself. sometimes it the horse or pony 'cause he could just be having a bad day it was just unlucky for you to ride him that day   trust me with this have ridden some crazy horses and pony where me and him or her did not go together at all. but i tried riding them again with more confidence and it was fine. don't sweat about screwing up in front of the other riders because everyone has their own bad days and have troubles with some horse.  Good luck with him!|`|7PAGYzdhaa	MAKE HIM BEHAVE!!!! do not let him get the best of you. If he spooks at friggen snow ( that;s the most retarted thing ive ever heard of from oa horse!) then pull him up and smack him, or kick him. You've let him get away with too much. You need to mentally feel like the boss, and then you'll act the part. When he takes off woth you, don't be scared, be mad! Spin him around or something when he does that. He just needs to know. and when he is good be really excited and praise him alot! hope this helps!  Ja-maken me blush  Also, I know it's scary when horses are out of control, but don't freeze up, if you freeze up, you'll quit riding and then thats when you'll fall!  Sit up and ride. Dont give up on this pony. Make it your personal to get some good rides out of him!:)|`|it3Bh2wEaa	There could be many reasons why something seems to always go wrong. You said you ride him sometimes, which could mean that on those few days, the pony might have just been having an off day. If it never happens on any other horse, it most likely is not your riding.     It may also be that you two just don't "mesh". You can't really force a relationship between eachother, and you two may just not be making that connection you need.|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	It may seem out of the ordinary routine, but it sounds like a little time with the horse on the ground would help develope some better understanding between the two of you.  Horses are extremely sensitive to not only our attitudes but learn very quickly what they can and cannot get away with.  Horses are opportunistic.  If they can, they will, and not because they are "bad", but just because that's part of their nature.  Work with this horse on the ground with just halter and lead rope to establish a bit more leadership with him.  He must lead on when you ask him, stop when you ask him, and back up when you ask him.  Reinforce his good following by brief pauses between exercises when he follows your cues.  It you work with him on the ground for a while, following good horsemenship rules, you will find him a whole lot better under saddle.  Plus you will have learned to relax a bit more whenever you work with him or ride him.|`|eC3IamvWaa	don't feel bad my dad gave me a horse for my b day and the first time i rode her she got spoked by a car and threw me and the she spoked another time with me and i was the only one she done that with but you have to feel like the boss or they can pick up on your fear it is scary when they act up though
h6t4aRUOaa	I looked at several books I have and there is no turtle buster to be found. I have three Wallace Hemphill Old Family Reds. All are UKC CH and 1 is Schutzhund ll. I also called the breeder I got mine from because you made me curious. He's been breeding for 35 years and all he could find was a kennel using that name but no bloodline. I figured he would know, he was a good friend of Richard Stratton, considered by many to be a top authority in pit bulls. He said to look at your pedigree and see what else is on there, maybe farther back, like 5 or 6 generations. Good Luck.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Its just a kennel name.  Doesn't really mean anything.|`|a2a183cfeaa8bd52e7143ef3708c4c6daa	Never heard of this bloodline. Rednose, Bluenose, and American is like a breed of the pit bull terriers, just to describe what "catagory" to put them in based on the color of their nose. There are a ton of bloodlines, mostly from breeders making their "own" bloodlines up. Like Gotti, Camelot, ect., depending on where you got the dog, their might be more of thet specific bloodlines in your area. Like where I live, everyone has gotti, Jeep, Snoop, Camelot, Old Family Red (which dates back for years and years). So, to answer your question, it's probably a "made up" bloodline. B/c that isn't a type of Pit. Is the dad American (with a black nose), a Rednose, or a Bluenose? Thats all that matters.|`|Bz9wAaZpaa	Stephanie, the color of a dogs nose is NOT a bloodline! Nose /=/ blood.     You should ask who ever told you about turtle buster and/or who ever the dogs came from

rrLHU6ehaa	Depends on the species of Betta, and of course it's temperament.  Frankly the first answerer responder correctly.  Although Bettas can be kept in a container as small as 2.5 gallons, a 5 is better.    Also, Bettas require warmer temps thna these shrimp, roughly 80o F compared to a 65-72o F for the shrimp.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Add a plant or some kind of decoration. You really don't have room for another fish or snail.=
5PsKGss7aa	50/50..  The other dogs should not be unleashed & shouldnt have been on your property to begin with BUT your aunts dog should not be going around killing them..and then this time your aunt letting the dog go outside to just jump in the car isnt right, she should have held the leash till the dog was securily in the car..  Both are not that responsible pet owners...|`|bIaywrBCaa	the court would probably award the neighbor half the vet bills, finding each party 50/50 responsible. The chow mix is a danger and should be put down. Aggressive dogs should not be around other dogs. period.|`|um5CVvTfaa	Your aunts dog is going around killing and mauling dogs and you don't have an issue with it.  What is next, a child that comes into their property.  Wow, you seem really cold about the whole issue.  Sorry, I don't think I could live with myself if my dog (or relatives dog) had been killing or injuring others.    Hey TD trolls, would you want to live next to the terminator??  G forbid your dog get loose, you may find it torn apart.  Does that sound safe to you?  What if this was a child walking to school?    All right-- Karma to all!    Anubis-- I couldn't own a killer.  I would fear that it would be my grandsons next.  I'd be to blame because I knew the dog could do it.  Had done it.  All my dogs KNOW I am their alpha. They will drop ANYTHING on cue (except the new puppy-lol)|`|fmHHcFd5aa	technically its 50/50 just bc the dog was loose even if on a leash, but technically it should be on the other person with the jck russell because their dog was loose on your property. so really they are liable. bc your aunts dog is a chow mix they will blame it on the dog as they are considering these types of dogs vicious and are trying to have them ban in alot of states along with about 50 other breeds. These dogs get automatically blamed no matter what as unfair as it is. but legally it is not all your aunts fault.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I would say 50/50 since both dogs were not under control at the time.  I would lean a lil less negligent on your aunt side since it happened on her property but still in the front & unless front is fenced & closed off then she is at fault too. Too bad all around for everyone & esp. the dogs.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You better get a lawyer. They will try to bring in the other mauling and it doesn't sound good to me|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I think your aunt needs to contact a lawyer who knows the local laws regarding dogs in her area.  The legal responsibility here has absolutely nothing to do with which dog got hurt or killed.  It comes down to who was legally allowed to be where they were.  Technically your Aunt's dog was still on private property when/where the attack occurred (at least that's what it sounds like) and community leash laws do not apply to private property.  Unless your aunt's dog set foot off of her property (and unfortunately it legally only takes one foot) your aunt was not breaking any laws.  The neighbors on the other hand WERE clearly in violation of the leash law as their dog was not only off of their property but had actually come onto your aunt's property.  In most areas the neighbors are at fault for this incident since they were breaking the leash law and your aunt's dog was on her property when their dog trespassed.  But laws regarding dogs vary so much from community to community that this may not be the case for your aunt.  If the neighbors are going to contest this in court then your aunt needs to hire a lawyer.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	50/50|`|gjD8pndjaa	Did it take place on your property?    Either way, its a serious situation for your mix.  Killing two dogs just shouldn't happen.  Its a sign that there are serious issues there.  I don't know the extent of the law but they might deem him unsafe or something|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Your aunts neighbors are definitely responsible for their dogs being loose.  But your aunt unfortunately will probably end up paying big time for what happened.  She really needs to keep a hold of her dog's leash until the car door is closed.  Being that the same dog has previously mauled another dog, your aunt realizes that her dog is not a pet-friendly dog and needs to take all necessary precautions.|`|9UttDvcsaa	I think you chaulk it up as an unfortunate accident.  The neighbor would be at fault for not confining her dog.  You can't just let your dogs run loose.  Your aunt should not feel bad, it was an accident and she was the responsible pet owner that had an unfortunate ACCIDENT she didn't neglect the responsibility of her dog's safety as the neighbor did.  So it is the neighbor's fault.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Well, technically they are correct, but at the same time, the dog was off leash and on your aunts property. It's not your aunts fault. I do the same thing as she does to let my shepherds get up in the car.      EDIT: I would also say good riddance of some little brat came on to MY property and my shepherds attacked them. That is Karma right there for you. Parents should watch their kids and not let them do whatever they want. Because then MY dog would get blamed for their stupidity and ignorance. I don't like kids, I don't like small dogs, and I have a large fence and a beware of dog sign for a reason.    You know, Sonbear, Chows are a breed known for their slight aggression problem. It's not the dogs fault if another little dog comes on to it's property. It's doing what it's instincts propel it to do. If you owned that dog, would you just put it down?|`|bMYv0fBHaa	Is there a difference between backyard and frontyard? Since it didn't count when it happened in her backyard, why should it be any different in the front yard (or driveway). Either way, it's HER property. If the dog is on HER property, WHY does it have to be leashed?!?    I agree that this dog probably shouldn't be around other dogs...but the point is that the SPCA is contradicting themselves.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I think it should be the neighbor's fault. They are responsible for what happens to their dog while it is running loose, regardless of what has happened before. If they let the dog run to a house where they KNOW their is a dog aggressive dog, it's their fault if it is injured or killed. However, since your aunt's dog has a "record" it could go badly for her. If she really wants to keep the dog, I would suggest getting a good lawyer. Good luck! I hope your aunt gets to keep her dog.       Oh, to the person who said that the dog might go after children next: don't be ridiculous. Dogs do not "progress" in their aggression like serial killers; they do not move from animals to people. IF the dog's problem is prey driven, then it might be an issue, but if it is true dog aggression, there is no issue. Even dogs with strong prey drive can be fine around children if they are socialized properly.|`|RJyrBJvxaa	Not sure...I would say 50/50 because both dogs were technically not under control by either owner.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	If this happened on your Aunt's "property" then the other dog owners are at fault.   I think personally the JRT's owners are either way. Yes, he dog did the killing, but it was I'm assuming on HER property, not the property of the JRT owners.     The idiot owners should have actually taken care of their dog. Poor thing.|`|VaYjl71Laa	her dog was leashed, the other dog that got killed was not.  It is the neighbor's fault.  These are the types of consequences that occur with NOT TRAINING YOUR DOG people.  The neighbors let their dog out with no leash on, I don't care what the situation, it IS their fault.      I would like to add if people have a problem with this, your morons.  Why should I be responsible if some dog comes onto my property WITHOUT my permission.  I would even sue the owners for potential trauma and harm to my dogs.|`|0JlOaYIIaa	This is so crazy, I had the EXACT same situation. My dog is a retriever/chow mix. She looks like a flat coat retriever, but acts like a chow. She met a Jack Russel the other day and went off on the little dog.  Luckily, she was on leash and the terrier was growling at my dog.    The owner did not seem to care if his JRT had behavior problems.    About your situation.... it seems like their dogs have behavior issues. If the Jack Russell came over to your property and initiated a fight with your dog then I feel like it's the JRT's fault.
O545aSKWaa	Either way, she'll adjust. Dogs get over stuff like that much quicker than you or I.     Out of curiosity though, does your x-husband not want the dog?|`|JsBb732Maa	Take her with you, you and your kids are her family and mean a lot more to her than the house/neighborhood.|`|xi9amEG2aa	I moved in with my boyfriend, Summer 2007, and we brought my dog from my mom's house where she had lived the last 8 years.  We are over a 45 minute drive...and she was fine with the move.  She didn't eat a lot during the first couple days, and kind of moped around because she was living with two other dogs.  After about 2 weeks, she was back to her normal self.  She was eating like she used to, she was all hyper and playful like usual too.  Now whenever my mom or anybody else comes to visit or we have to take her up there for the weekend, it's like I'm not even there.  I can tell that she misses them just by the way she acts.  But then again, when we pick her up, she just wants to go home, and ignores my sister and mom...just like she did when we drop her off.  It's funny.    She will take a week or two to completely adjust and get back to her self, but she'll be fine.|`|b4NcFBhraa	Take her, dogs move on a lot faster than humans, she'll be over it before you're all unpacked. :) trust me. We've moved a lot with our dogs, they make new friends easier than humans :)|`|3YMETqStaa	Family trumps house any day of the week.  As long as it gets similar/better care at the new house, take her with you.  If he was the primary care giver/has the best bond you might want think twice.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	It's up to you.  The dog will adapt to whatever decision you make and whatever environment it ends up in.  If you are convinced  you can give it a better home, or just can't live without it, then take it.  You'll regret it if you don't.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Your dog should not be running loose, no matter what neighborhood you live in.  I would think it would depend on who was giving her the most attention.  If you ex-husband was the one who fed her, gave her water, played with her, groomed her, etc. then he should keep her.  And what about your children?  Are they attached to her?  You are already leaving the home that they are used to too.  Maybe they would do better if their dog was with them?    Sorry that you are going through this and I wish you and your family well.|`|xKLydoTpaa	take the dog with you.  the dog would be more upset over the lose of it's family of six years than it would be over the loss of a neighborhood|`|HKAA8B56aa	Take your dog and let it get to know the new neighborhood|`|ixOE0onnaa	i think you shouldn't causes she might get angry. or upset
rrLHU6ehaa	Dolphins live in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coasts of the Southeastern US.  The following site has pretty much all the info you would need.  Be aware these wouldn't make good pets.    Edit:  For those who didn't know, or didn't realize, this section is about pet FISH.  Although the dolphins I wrote about here couldn't be considered pets by any means, neither can the cetaceans.  However, they ARE fish, so come closer to fitting this question than mammals.    Edit more:  "Remarks: one of the fastest-growing fish, thought to live no more than 5 years; swimming speed is estimated at 50 knots; spawns in warm ocean currents throughout much of the year; young found in sargassum weed; feeds on flying fish and squid." *|`|e9gXZsKxaa	In the ocean.|`|29Um8OCvaa	Umm... most dolphins live in the sea, but some live in the Amazon River. (Boto dolphins)    They all communicate with echolocation and hunt with it as well. They are mammals, and they work together as a team to catch fish. Here's more about them:    http://teacher.scholastic.com/dolphin/ab...|`|KSMHGwDOaa	Dolphins are found in just about every ocean in the world, and even in some rivers. The most common dolphin is, as you probably know, the Bottlenose dolphin. Bottlenose dolphins live in most oceans where the water is warm. Atlantic Bottlenose dolphins on the other hand, can live in cooler temperatures. Other dolphins, such as the Ganges River dolphin, live in rivers. Fun fact: the Ganges River dolphin doesn't have any eyes!

TjLCnxkKaa	Ideally you should shim the base of the stand to get it level but the bottom of the tank isn't at risk of collapse. The most likely place the tank would lose its integrity would be the silicone on the side closest to the floor. I doubt a 5 mm lean would do that in a ten gallon. But seeing as it would take little effort to level the stands why not do it. It will look a lot better?     If you don't you might have a slide problem during an earthquake though.|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	yeah thats fine.  my 55 isnt exactly leveled but it still does fine... it is actually about .25 inches off lol|`|pAxV2GA0aa	It would be ideal if you leveled the tank for the reason that it will place extra stress on the front of the tank and could cause it to weaken over time and crack, which would not be fun. My tank wasn't level so i used a few pieces of wood to level it out.|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	yes its fine, there is a school of thought that says sightly off level is better than shimming,     the theory being that off level spread across the entire stand base is more structurally sound then level directed in one tiny shimmed base
qqUvoC5uaa	Could be the early signs of Pug Dog Encephalitis (gee look mixed dogs still get the purebred dogs genetic defects)    Seizures are typically the main symptom of PDE.  However keep a look out for lethargy, pacing in circles, sudden aggression, and pressing her head against things such as walls.    DO NOT rub her neck. When she is seizing, make sure she is in an open area where she will not come into contact with anything and don't touch her until she's through it. Rubbing the neck could break it during this time.    Try getting on a payment plan with your vet. Seizures in general are a very serious condition and could lead to a painful death for your dog.    Add:   It depends on what kind of "people food" you give her.  If you're giving her an uncooked chicken breast that would be fine. A slab of cake is not.  RAW meat of any kind.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Why would you rub her neck hard????????  I guess google up some things and try to find out....or maybe go on the site that a lot of puggle owners go to  pug.meetup.com and ask there.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Seizures are normally caused by a neurological disorder, although some types are viralor bacterial and really need to be treated by a vet.  If you cannot afford a large lump sum payment speak with your vet about a payment plan or see if there is a ASPCA or other shelter in your area that offers discounted treatment.  Unfortunately rubbing her neck is not going to help her at all.  There is no home remedy that is going to fix your girl.|`|sOkePjK3aa	Sorry I don't know anything you could do but take her to a vet and see if they can figure it out. Good luck with your dog. I hope you can cure her. :[|`|a2a183cfeaa8bd52e7143ef3708c4c6daa	This isn't a 'sure' solution, but I once overlooked a website about chihuahuas and seizures. Try offering the dog calcium, like a tums/rolaids crushed up. You might even have to chew it up for the dog and put some of it in her mouth. Even small breeds get something called low blood sugar disorder. where they get extremely weak and/ or can have seizures, rub some syrup on their gums or anything sweet. Try to look up seizures in dogs/ pugs , ect. more, and at least talk to a vet for advice. A lot of people at pet supplt stores know more than you think, and have great advice. Good luck!!!

I mean he can't just take the dog away. Try to housebreak your dog so your dad won't have as much support to why the dog should go. If he threatens to do it again, cry. Make him feel bad about it. Cry for a really long time and shut yourself in your room. Act dramatic. Hope it works. Kinda weird I know... but hey. Good luck.|`|r62mRF3waa	You should ask your dad calmly what he doesn't like about your dog. Then try to find reasonable ways to solve them. tell your dad if that doesn't work that if the whole family loves him he shouldn't take that away from them. If that doesn't work tell him that he gives the dog away he will be taking and killing a family member, because the dog is pretty old he won't live to find another owner in the shelter. suggest everthing possible even suggest to keep the dog outside in a warm shed until he is fully trained. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TffCSzHxaa	Send your dad to a boarding place and leave him! It's the entire family against him! He should just get over it and ignore the dog!

You should be grateful your father lived with it for 12 years.  You need to get that dog housebroken.  If you do love that dog, you'll take the time to train her properly.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	I really hate to say this, but it sounds more like you should get rid of your dad.   Not seriously, but what he's doing sounds very controlling and the "I'm the man of the house I can do what I want" type of tone.    Someone needs to step up and tell your dad that to give the dog away if a FAMILY decision, not just his. And since the majority wants to keep the dog, your dad will just have to "suffer"  Or maybe he could get away from his whole superiority complex and maybe spend some time training the dog, walking him, or just in general spending time and playing with him.    You really should have housebroken him in the first place.|`|b4NcFBhraa	Tell your dad that in a month (or two) you'll earn enough money to get a dog run. You get the dog run and then put a cover on the top and give him blankets and a dog bed, toys, food and water bowls, etc... To keep him in during the day and possibly night (if he gets too mad.) If he doesn't agree then, sorry I dunno what to do. Tell your dad his time's almost up anyways, to be patient and he'll be sorry when the dog passes, that he was soo rude. I hope you can figure this out... Sorry if it doesn't help much. You need to talk to your dad about your feelings. He may be thinking that you just don't care, tell him how much you do. Let him know that what he's doing to the dog is hurting you.  I'm really sorry and good luck with your dog :(|`|YV1bOajXaa	Have the dog wear a doggy diaper in the house  - problem solved.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Why haven't you house-trained your dog????  If you can't take responsibility for the dog, you have no business having one.|`|9UttDvcsaa	Take your dog of 12 years and your Mom and move!  Your dad needs to get a grip and take responsibility for the family pet not throw it away and abandon him.  Seriously, at this point in his life you will probably do best crate training him or baby gating him in a bathroom to teach him boundaries.  If you don't take him out to pee, he will have to relieve himself in the house....consistency is key here.  Take the time and house train your dog, it sounds like it will save his life.  You do relieve at 12 years of age, if he goes to the shelter he will probably sit on a cold concrete floor until he is euthanized.  If you can't buy a crate shut him in a bathroom and take him out frequently.  When he is in the house loose watch him like a hawk.  It is never too late to house train a dog, My rescue dog was 10 when she learned.  Good Luck.|`|mFNEbR3Maa	shana, i feel the same way you feel my dad wanted to give away my puppy which is 3 months and a lab.But maybe you should try chaining him to a safe non hurtful chain out side with a dog house and a food and water bowl;) Best of luck! :D     P.S. i can only keep her if i keep her outside|`|GDTPhQHeaa	Your dog is 12 years old and he wants to get rid of him?!  Unfortunately the chances of your dog finding a permanent home at his age are slim to none.I would do ALL I could to prevent your dad from getting rid of him. I would start by training him not to go to the bathroom in the house. If that's not possible then you may have to leave him outside (away from your dad) and just make sure he is comfortable and warm if it's getting cold perhaps encourage your dad to buy a dog house? Be sure to give him plenty of walks and he will be happy. Dogs tend to avoid peeing where they sleep so he shouldn't go in your bedroom if you close the door at night and just let him out promptly in the morning!|`|oiBGMHcBaa	I hope your mom gets there in time. Ok, I would suggest you to have a little talk with your dad ok?  You love that dog right?  Tell him how you feel for ex.  If I were you I would say:  Daddy don't give away my dog! Please I beg you.He is my best friend he is always there to cheer me up and when I am sad he always knows how to make me feel better. When I come home one of the most important things that make me actually happy to go home is our dog! He means everything to us! Yeah, he might not talk but he listens to my problems! That is better than talking to yourself! If you still are not convinced! Go ahead kneel with the dog and stare him in the eyes and tell him that you hate him and never liked him. can you resist the eye contact that he gives you? Huh Dad? If your still not convinced then it just proves that you do not have a heart!  Well that sorta what you can tell him. I think my ex. will give you an idea of what to say=).I think that is all you can do.  You and your family(including our dog) will be in my prayers.  God Bless|`|v6dlSla3aa	when you dad sends your dog away, find where he is and get him. spend your dads money to buy him back. or you could set up a craigslist wanting and list the description of your dog, then say you will pay any amount, and when your dad agrees to give him to this anonymous person, you be the person buying your dog back with HIS MONEY. problem solved|`|RyNvYrJmaa	if i were you i would be busting my butt to get that dog housebroken. take him for long walks everyday to get some energy out so he will be calm in the house while your dad is around and it will also give him the chance to do alot of peeing while he is on his walk.   you may have been 4 when you got the dog, but you certainly arent 4 now so if you really want to show your dad you're serious then i would get working.    also, if your dog is 12 and you think it seems like more than just not being housebroken that it may be time for some bloodwork. kidney problems arent unheard of in older dogs..though i doubt your dad is willing to pay any money for a vet visit by the sounds of things.
HTitV7Plaa	Your little buddy doesn't want to sleep yet and likes attention from you.  You could try giving him/her a treat when you go lay down.

If you find this annoying, rather than punish your cat for following her natural activity schedule, train her to shift her active phase to earlier in the evening or later in the morning. You might find it easier to provide kitty with quieter nighttime activities that are less intrusive on your sleep; and don't let kitty use your bed and bedroom as the playing field.|`|TK23xwAkaa	You forgot to say goodnight i think or you bring to your bedroom together..and last but not least..you meow too..(just joking)|`|KQMhCV49aa	they want you to stay up and play

Why couldn't you have waited? I would seriously consider returning the goldfish.     The goldfish may not make it until you buy the tank. There is not enough oxygen in the bucket, and he will suffer from ammonia poisoning. He would do a slight bit better if you had an airstone.     A single fancy goldfish needs a minimum of twenty gallons with double the filtration.    ~An oranda is defined by its wen. The wen is the bubble like growth on top of the head.|`|ICzM3T8taa	I doubt you have aeration on the bucket and no plants either.

I6KKFwxXaa	I have 4 rats now the newest I got Friday night and 3 of them are hairless. My hairless seem to be a little more affectionate than my black and white hooded. I have a ferret cage for the older ones which they can not fit through the bars on but they also have a great small animal very nice large cage that I would love to get for my 4   It is best to buy same sex pairs and everyone has their own preference as to which is better male or female I love my girls. Having both hairless and one with hair I have noticed the hairless do not have an oder like the one with hair gets sometimes but I wipe her down with baby wipes from time to time to help keep her smelling fresh. They are very smart girls and very good pets I think if you got a couple you would find them as enjoyable as I have. Good Luck  EDIT I do not use a heat lamp and my girls get minimal scratches you have to keep their nails clipped and if you do not feel comfortable doing it yourself you can take them to the vet and they will do it for you. I use baby nail clippers and I usually cry when I clip their nails I know it sounds silly but I always think I am hurting them Gracie licks my tears and gives me kisses to let me know it is okay. I do use a lot of fleece which I can buy at Wal mart, or even fleece baby blankets from the dollar tree the ferret fleece usually is bought at the pet store and cost 10 x more than what I spend I have bought expensive for them to only chew down the 20.00 hammock so now I just buy the scraps left over at wal mart or like I said the baby blankets from the dollar tree.|`|WKA3mmBQaa	The only difference between hairless rats and rats with hair is the hair part, lol. Though if you get a hairless from a back yard breeder or a petstore a hairless is more likely to be sick.  -They are social pets and need a companion:  http://www.ratfanclub.org/single.html  -Rats need at least one hour out of the cage a day  -Rats are social creatures and love human attention  -Their cage will need to be cleaned at the least, weekly  -Look here for really good cages http://martinscages.com/  -Don't feed rats seed mixes! Lab blocks are best. Good brands are Mazuri, Harlan Teklad, Oxbow, and Subee's Mix. Along with lab blocks they should be fed fruits and veggies daily.  -Rats should never be kept in aquariums as they can get diseases from living in it.  -Pine and Cedar are terrible litter and need to be avoided. Good kinds of litter are fleece, shredded newspaper, and yesterday's news.  -Rats along with being social are very intelligent and can be taught to use the litter box.  -Never ever pick up a rat by it's tail!!  -Have you considered adopting a rat instead of getting two from a pet store (most are very unhealthy and/or pregnant)? Check out these websites for rescues:  www.petfinder.com  www.goosemoose.com  www.ratster.com  -Read more about pet rats here:  http://www.quite.co.uk/rats/  http://www.mypetrat.com/  http://www.afrma.org/rminfo1.htm  www.goosemoose.com  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/ratli...  Up front the rats may cost $10 more from a breeder, but in the long run (if you get one from a REPUTABLE breeder) it will save you tons of money in vet bills! If you get one from a rescue you will be saving a life.|`|bEknG9yZaa	i love rats they are good pets you cant let them go they  will run away    you have to take good care of them you have to clean there cage every month give them good rat food just take good care of the rats or rat and that is all you have to do and you are fine        i mean FINE !!!!|`|44kEtDvIaa	Check site below.

They tend to have respiratory problems that cause high vet bills ( I had a $400 rat from this LOL) Hairless rats get chilled & injured more easily - You also have to rub olive oil into their skin when it gets dry|`|PGkbPBZmaa	Rats make great pets! They are smart, clean, friendly, don't bite and don't smell. They can be trained to do all sorts of tricks too.     My favorite thing about rats is that they don't bite like hamsters and gerbils. They are also super cuddly. My rat use to come sleep in the hood of my hoodie or in my pocket while I walked around the house.    What  you need to know is -     -Rats are social animals, and need to be kept in at least same-sex pairs  -Rats need large wire cages, not cages made for hamsters and mice   -You should feed your rats lab blocks, and supplement with fresh treats a few times a week  -Once you get your rat pair, you should leave them alone for the first day so they can get use to their surroundings  -After a day or so you can start handling them and feeding them treats, once they get to know you and get use to you they will always want to play.    You can also feed your rats a variety of fresh fruit, vegetables, and even some chicken. You can look online for a list of things they can eat.|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	hairless require more attention and care because of their lack of fur. they need a heat lamp to warm them up, since they are desert rats. but rats with hair can live normally in a human house, as long as your house isnt made up of ice cubes or any other extreme matrials such as those.    rats need big cages to run around in. they do bite and scratch, and their tail is very delicate and when handled incorrectly it can snap off, causing great pains to the rat. they need rat food, which are pellets, and maybe some fresh veggies and fruits now and then, not too much fruit since they have acid that isnt good for rodents. rats need a lot of care, they like to socilize and they dont enjoy time alone. they are not solitary animals like hamsters. try getting two rats, for company.|`|nmWztjGMaa	I have 4 rats, one is hairless.  As far as temperament goes, they are all pretty much the same.  I really like my hairless (Cupcake) because she is so different appearance wise.  I recommend females because I believe they are calmer and more interactive with people.  You may want to consider getting a pair (both females) since rats are social animals.  remember to litter box train them and upkeep will be much easier.  Rats are great pets, inexpensive, entertaining, they dont' require regular medical care, and they are easy to maintain.  Best wishes to you|`|ZA0XCfyaaa	the hairless rats tend to be on the stubborn and bitting side so hair is better. I know that male rats are harder to car for cuz they smell more from just being male,they're stuborn and they bite a lot. go for a female. they're more loving and dont bite as much. It also depends on what kind of enviroment u raise them in!|`|4FBB4srbaa	sorry to say but I feed them decon when I see them any where near my property|`|XDdpcvCGaa	they r gross|`|YqVtOSWwaa	Hairless are in no way different than any other rat. There are no "breeds" only different appearances. Hairless are normal rats, except with no hair. They are not "desert rats" as some wrongfully pointed out, and you should not ever use a heat lamp for them!!    Hairless rats do have physical needs. Because they do not have fur to warm them, they need more protein in their diet to keep their bodies from cooling too much. They are also more prone to getting colds and respiratory illnesses from drafts, so you might want to get a nice, fleecy ferret bed, and lots of warm scraps of cloth for nesting. They are also likely to get cuts since there is no fur to protect their skin, so you will want to check their skin daily, and have some antibiotics spare. Look up "rat first aid kit".     The other thing, rats are social animals, and require other rats to live with happily. This applies especially to hairless rats because there is nothing better than a couple of other furred rats to cuddle up to keep it warm. My hairless boy never sleeps alone.    On top of that, rats require other rats for mental stimulation. Single rats often live shorter lives and get sick more often. They also rely on your interaction greatly. They are very docile, and once tamed with lots of patience, can be trusted to run around or just hang out on your lap.    Rats need large, wire cages, such as those for ferrets, chinchillas and rabbits. You need to clean the cage once a week, or less if you litter train them. They also need time out of the cage for at least 1 hour each day. They are extremely intelligent animals, and succumb to boredom and even destructive behavior (like biting you) if not exercised both physically and mentally enough.     Please read these sites for more:  http://www.ratz.co.uk/  http://www.petratscanada.com/ratcare.htm  http://www.curiosityrats.com/|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Rats are clean, intelligent, affectionate animals which bond to their human companions in much the same way that dogs do, and with the right care should provide a comparable level of companionship.   Rats become very attached to their owners, make playful, sensitive pets, and can be taught to come by name and learn a variety of tricks. Unlike many other rodents, however, rats are a fairly high maintenance pet. They need at least an hour's playtime outside their cage every day. Because they are much more intelligent than many other small animals, rats can suffer greatly if not given enough attention, free-range time, and environmental stimulation. While rats are extremely rewarding pets and will repay any attention and affection you give them a thousand fold, they may not be suitable for everyone; if you cannot guarantee to give your rats at least an hour of quality time every day, then perhaps a lower maintenance pet would be more suitable.
XI2iylR4aa	There is more work involved than most people think, you can't just stick the rabbit in a cage, feed it pellets, then forget about it.  They need a proper diet, exercise, and attention.  Their living area needs to be kept clean.  The owner is responsible for monitoring the rabbit for any changes that can indicate a health problem.  Rabbits usually don't let us know when they are sick until they are VERY sick.  Being knowledgeable is extremely important.    Yes, they can be litter trained.  Rabbits are usually more reliably litter trained when they are adults, and altered.  http://rabbit.org/faq/sections/litter.ht...    I always thought it was best to get a young rabbit, but if you get an adult, particularly one that is already neutered, you get to know their personality better, so you can choose a rabbit that better fits your personality and lifestyle.    Depending on their breed and care, they can live from 8-12 years.  We're planning on keeping our rabbit around for a good long time!    I have read that dwarf rabbits tend to be more nervous, and are more likely to bite, but a lot of people love them.      All rabbits require the same high level of care, but some rabbits are harder to take care of.  Angoras, for example, have very long fur that needs to be brushed daily.  English lops have very long, delicate ears that are more prone to injury.  I think other than rabbits with special needs such as long hair, or a preexisting medical condition, they all require about the same amount of work.    My best rabbit experience:  Adopting my current rabbit.  We went to a rabbit rescue (which I highly recommend!), and met a few rabbits.  They were really cute, but we didn't really bond with any of them.  Finally, they decided that since we had prior rabbit experience, they would introduce us to a "difficult rabbit."  She had been dumped out on the streets with a broken leg which didn't heal properly, leaving her with a crooked back leg.  She had bitten a few volunteers, so they said she would be difficult to adopt out.  We hit it off right away!  She followed us around, she stayed still while we pet her, and yes, she did nip once or twice, but it didn't matter.  She had chosen us.    After a few weeks of adjustment, she is totally trusting of us, and we of her.  She hasn't bitten anybody in a few months, and she is the sweetest, mushiest little rabbit in the world.    Good luck with your decision.  We are totally in love with our bun.  It is a big commitment, but it has been 100% worth it to us.    Here's a site with great info that might help with your decision:  http://rabbit.org/    And here's a page with links to adoption listings:  http://rabbit.org/adoption/index.html    I highly highly recommend adopting.  It might be a little more expensive initially, but your rabbit will normally be neutered before you get him or her, which will save you money, and the stress of post-surgical care.  Also rescues will give you a lot of info about proper rabbit care.  It was a great experience.  Plus you're saving a life!|`|hLohtlPEaa	I had a chocolate and white Dutch rabbit. It was more work than I thought it would be. Yes, you can train them to use a litter box. When you give them freedom, which they love, they chew everything. If you must get one, get one young. I'm not sure about the life expectancy,but someone told me about 8 years. I have no experience with dwarf varieties. Cleaning the cage is key. You can never let it go longer than 24 hours without cleaning. They can be temperamental. My rabbit would be happy as long as he was loose in the house. When I would put him in his cage, he would charge me, grunting and showing his teeth.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	I am a rabbit owner, House Rabbit Society Volunteer, and i took a class on rabbits.    -Yes tons of work involved(cage cleaning, grooming, playing, vet visits)    -yes they can be litter box trained like a cat    -13 years at least    - dwarf rabbits are smaller but they all need tons of love and care    -no they all need a ton of care    fun story-My bunny stole my apple once when i went to answer the   phone.      If you have more questions you contact me at:  cassieg2006@hotmail.com    I answer a ton of rabbit questions and you can't trust all the answers on yahoo.|`|ddb8ad067ec32dcdd2fb309b4c8b783aaa	About as much work as a cat, They can be potty trained with pee but not poop, yes, 7-10 yrs, Dwarfs are more high strung IME, My rabbit is a grumpy little Holland Lop that pees on my friend's feet LOL|`|4Hr1gjxgaa	they r hard work but they r so cute if u dont clean the cage everyday it smells rele bad and if u dont watch them when they r out of the cage they will chew on nethin and everythin lol hope this helps|`|u61yKsE3aa	It depends on what you consider a lot of work.  I think rabbits are easier than many other pets but the still take a considerable amount of care.  Theyneed a large cage. They need a proper diet, a hide box, safe bedding, food dish, water bottle,  hay holder, and plenty of chews and toys.  They should be bathed regularaly,  Played with daily  and let out to exersize.      You cna potty train them I had one that used a litter box really well and potty trained so easily I've had others that are a little harder to get in the habbit.  And I had one that no matter what we did just never got it.    A young rabbit will bond to you faster and they are easier to train young.  How ever some rescues have bunnys that are full grown, and already potty trained.  So you know what your gettiing.  Plus many rescues have already altered their rabbits which is good for the rabbit and saves you that issue.  So either way there will be pros and cons I would look for rabbits and see which one you fall for after handling  them.    10-16 years depending on breed.    Dwarfs for the most part are just a smaller rabbit but I have also found they can be  a little more skitish thats not to say all are though.  Some people like dwarfs because they  can be keopt in a smaller cage.    Most rabbits have similar cage but long haired rabbits like angoras and lionheads have more grooming requirements.    I had a rabbit that was so good she walked on a leash and came when we called (i'm sure the treats helped with that:)
ngebYukSaa	i dont think that a cats instincts can be turned on and off at will.    My cats instincts to hunt are on FULLTIME. hes always pouncing and chasing and just being crazy.    But yes you can overstimulate them and they get excited and possibly start using their teeth and claws when youre playing with them.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	You are teaching it to attack you by pushing it that far. You're making it mad not activating it's hunting instincts.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Sure. Really, to a cat, playing are all just forms of hunting or self-defense with the violence turned down a notch. And everyone gets overexcited and takes things too far when playing every once in a while.|`|2DuEUIDkaa	My cat tends to get excited when I play with her, and sometimes she'll scratch, bite, or both. When your cat gets excited just leave it alone and it will settle down.|`|sOkePjK3aa	Yeah just let it alone for a while and give it some time to calm itself down. My cat does this a lot. Just try to play for a limited time so that it doesn't get too excited.|`|c4f8a63972685e95e511d29969f672a3aa	Yes its possible to overstimulate  your cat.  When this happens, just let them run it off and cool off.  Things will be back to normal soon.
8i90ov0Gaa	Reggie, you've been looking at pet store prices too much. You can buy boas starting out at 50 bucks from breeders at reptile shows. If I lived close to this person, I would gladly take his 60 bucks.|`|nmzpdvkqaa	im sorry but i really dont think youll be able to get a healthy red tail boa for only $60 dollars and a original x-box. i dont think you can get much for the x-box maybe $40 because of the x-box360 and ps3 and red tails will go for $150 and up.
ajnGHNr8aa	Their is no Alaskan Husky, it is a Malamute. They look like Huskies but are larger and are more of a working type dog. The Husky is more of a speed dog.   Both the Golden and the Husky are very intelligent dogs and are high energy. Both need room to run and require a big commitment for exercise. I have never had a Golden but I know that Huskies can be stubborn and a little hard to train as they are a free spirit kind of dog. They are very loyal to their owners but mine was overly loyal and had a seperation anxiety issue whenever I would leave. Both dogs are great pets (knew friends with Goldens) and are great with children.     Do your homework before deciding on either breed.|`|im3vWyv6aa	There are Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes. Huskies were bred for speed and Malamutes were bred for power.    Huskies & Malamutes are great dogs, but they are a BIG challenge to own. Containment is a constant battle as they are escape artists and love to run. If you don't want to deal with that... Golden Retrievers are great.|`|0SHAY9TQaa	I own a purebred Golden Retriever :) She is the greatest dog ever!    Difference between a Husky or Golden? Completely different looks, temperment, grooming needs, and energy.    You need to do your research! Choose a dog based on how well he would fit into your lifestyle. Never choose a dog based on looks alone.    Good Luck!    Adopt from www.petfinder.com|`|mTTPLly4aa	Golden retriever|`|xYsCC5UXaa	no, they wouldn't make a good mix.  they'd make an unwanted litter of mutts that would take 7 homes from 7 shelter dogs who deserve it more.|`|9Y56hQRlaa	Well, I own a golden Retriever, And they are very willing to learn and to make you happy, they are very sweet are easy to train, They love everyone and are normally good with strangers they are very beautiful and love to swim and are playful. Huskeys have these things too but are known sometimes not to be good with everyone but they are a very beautiful breed.    I dont think they'd be that bad mixed together....  I think it acctually might be pretty nice, well they've mixed chihuahuas and german shephards before..... I think they would be beautiful!      Anyways i dont think there is that much difference between Alaskan or siberian huskey and for anybody i would suggest a golden, They are very good dogs and with proper training are very well behaved.|`|B0hTxUnCaa	that is simple i like the husky  but i really good dog is the norwegian elk hounds they look like Husky kind of but they are good family dogs look them up on google they re so nice looking i wont go to another breed after mine pass i will stick with the norwegian elk hound breed!!!!!|`|Jiqw96TIaa	An Alaskan husky isn't a breed. It's any usually spitz-type dog that's good for pulling sleds. A Siberian Husky is a breed of dog registered with the AKC.     Which breed is better depends on what you like. Both dogs need a lot of exercise and have a high activity level, so if you like a calm, lazy dog, these aren't the breeds for you. Huskies, however, tend to be a bit calmer.     Huskies are great outdoor dogs. They vocalize mainly by howling, "talking", and whining, rather than barking. They tend to like other dogs, so you might want to get more than one. They're more independent than Golden Retrievers, are harder to train, and more dominant, so you'll need to be consistently firm with them. Obedience training is a must with both dogs. You should have a lot of room for these dogs or be very active. Goldies are great with children. Siberians aren't bad either. Both live fairly long lives.     As for a mix, you never know what you're going to get. But if you can take a very active dog and keep up with the exercise, I don't see why not.|`|kMaqQHWfaa	Alaskans (Alaskan Huskies) aren't actually a registered breed, they are a mix of breeds. The often have a bit of greyhound, sibe, pointer and lots of other breeds. They are fantastic dogs for running (that's why they are the most commonly used dog for raced like the Iditarod & Yukon Quest).     Sibes are wonderful dogs but you need tor esearch the breed thoroughly and if you are not up to a challenge they are not the breed for you.     Jimmy D talked about Sibes and then when talking about Norwegian Elkhounds said "but they are good family dogs", suggesting that Sibes aren't. Sibes are fantastic family dogs, they love people and are great with kids. They are very much family dogs!     Jesus spoke of Sibes and Retreivers and said Sibes are not good with everyone. I have had a lot of experience with the breed and have found they love everyone. There are very few sibes that are not good with people.....you get this with any breed. Sibes are a very good judge of character so if you come across a Sibe that doesn't like someone I'd suggest you look for the reason why as there will normally be a good reason for it.    You cannot compare a Sibe and a Retriever - they are two totally different breeds. You need to research both breeds thoroughly and choose whichever one fits into your lifestyle the best.     I would not recommend breeding a Sibe with a Retriever - there are far too many mixes out there and a lot of them end up at shelters.|`|h7MoNLFPaa	I haven't had any problems with my alaskan husky.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Bettas come in a range of sizes, it's all down to genetics. I've had boys that are anything from 1.5" in body length to almost 2.5" in body length! Yours sound absolutely fine.    You don't find them much in the west, but Giant Bettas have now been bred, anything from 4"-7" in body length! This is all down to genetics and selective breeding. Just look at these monsters:  http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r150/...  http://www.bettas4all.nl/photos/Articles...  http://www.bettysplendens.com/ImageResiz...
5QG9Zrjaaa	You can use whatever breed you like.  We used Arabs for the sure footed, good endurance and frankly they were prettier.  We took ours to the Colorado mountains and went up and down for days and years!  We also had a draft cross mule, but he was just too smart to be the pack horse we wanted!    Gaited mules are only a 50-50 prospect, but surprisingly, gaiting seems to be a dominant characteristic.  Foxtrotters and TWH are usually used; I don't think a Saddlebred would make much sense.....mules are usually for hunting, distance riding or pulling work.      They work well for hunting (following coon hounds) because a mule can/will jump a barbed wire fence that a horse will get tangled in.  Mules often "deer jump" or jump from a standstill; they don't need a running start like a horse does.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Check out Meredith Hodges website - she has done more with mules and donkeys than just about anyone else.  BTW, she is Charles Schultz daughter - he was the creator of Peanuts.   She does jumping and dressage with her Mammoth donkeys and she does all kinds of dressage and eventing with her mules.  Their conformation does vary with the breed of horse used.  A mule out of a TB mare looks very different than one out of a Percheron or one out of a pony.  Mule colors can vary quite a bit also.  Check out the leopard Appy mule!|`|VyXYcCXtaa	1 no people can use any type of horse.. the person i know that breeds mules use qh adn tb because they are the horses that he has.... mules can do anything a horse can but they do have there own type of saddle it looks at like a roping saddle....i have no clue  2 i don't know any of those sorry

wHJucCuVaa	That depends very much on the barn owner: because its their barn, what they say goes. This specific owner might be very strict with the 1 month notice policy or they might be more lenient. It is understandable that a barn wants one month notice before someone moves their horse because the barn needs time to fill the stall, change records, or if no one is moving in to the soon-to-be vacant stall, downsize their feed order. However, because February 4th is so close to the 1st of the month, someone might be able to work a deal with their barn owner where they only have to pay half board or 3/4 board for march (that's what we did when we were moving and gave notice late).  Hope this helps :)

I don't know where you can get this product from, but here is a website.    http://www.treatsforpets.net/shop/index....    In the UK you can get this from Waitrose supermarkets.          The cats also go mad for some dried catnip, which I' m sure you can get in any good pet shop.
80S8U7Edaa	What a cutie pie!    http://www.gingerpuplane.com is an excellent site|`|p7swtBYzaa	Petco (you can take your dog there and try them on him), ebay, do a search.  I have a tiny dog and there are tons of places to get clothes for her - even Walmart has cute stuff now, so does Target.|`|s0XR8cxLaa	omg! shes so adorable!!!!!!!! she has the cutest blue eyes!  uhm pets arent accessories so u really shouldnt dress it up  anwayz u can go to a petstore   it would help more if u said where u lived like wat country or sumthing|`|IKX1QtUBaa	I suggest wal-mart,petco,petsmart,target, and other clothing stores or pet stores.|`|Mrs4JG9taa	Though I always think that chis look like overgrown RATS.

If they have a heart, they will bring at least one home.  Good luck!|`|EoBWFcJEaa	you could rescue a puppy from a puppy mill and tell them you want to rescue a puppy and show them pictures of a puppy mill. it's very sad, i want to rescue a puppy from a puppy mill.  and you shouldn't have to pay to rescue one.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	I don't know where you live but if you are in the US, there is a financial crisis here.  Parents don't even know if they are going to have a job tomorrow or if they can afford their house payment, let alone get another mouth to feed.  You are one lucky girl to have parents who let you have one dog.  Dogs are very expensive to feed, vet bills are OUTRAGEOUS and then you have the toys, collars, leashes, flea/tick and heartworm stuff is crazy expensive.  I spent over $2500 on my dog in the first year, NOT including the price I paid for him.  Be appreciative and let it alone.  Don't get them more aggravated or you'll end up with NO dog.|`|9W9l8HAuaa	tell them about the protection  do more chores to prove ur responsible  find a puppy on sale for a good price  if you take all the "stuff" to do into your hands they will fell less pressured  make some money adn offer to buy some supplies(a bag of dog food now & then, shampoo, the usual)  good luck!|`|neESvfDMaa	adopt a puppy from a shelter print out the story from the web or cut it out from a newspaper there is tons of adorable puppies who need homes look for shelters in your area or local paper.|`|IKX1QtUBaa	Say that you will take responsibility and care for him/her.
iKoxz7w4aa	You can use heavy duty shower curtains to enclose the cage. If there is a WalMart nearby you could check there as they generally carry them and they are rather inexpensive.     Igs need high humidity and heat, both of these environmental requirements are almost impossible to obtain and maintain in an open wire type cage. You are not going to kill your ig by providing it the proper enclosure and environment. You do need to invest in equipment to monitor the temps and humidity if you have not already done so.     Another way to help maintain humidity is to provide large leafed plastic plants that you mist daily and a large water dish, though without an enclosed cage it will be difficult to provide proper humidity no matter what you do.|`|Eyawiwc5aa	You would need some air flow, I wouldn't cover it all .. maybe 1/2 way up on all the sides. or at least 2 sides.  Make sure that you do use a heavy duty plastic/shower curtain other wise depending on if you have mesh w/ the plastic your igs nails could rip the plastic.  If you are just going to be using plastic, I wouldn't recommend just plastic. I would put mesh then plastic.  And look over the plastic daily look for whole, rips, tears, if your ig swallows any of the plastic it may or may not pass fecal matter wise, which would mean possible x-ray, possible surgery.

1gDTiPVyaa	Don't leave her cage door open when you're not there whether or not her wings are clipped.  Someone could walk into your room and step on her or she could bite into an electrical wire. She could also pick up something poisonous that you tracked in on the bottom of your shoes.  The salt that they put on sidewalks in the winter is not good for birds to eat. If you walk through the salt and wear your shoes into the room where she is, then the stuff is in the carpet. Don't, don't, don't leave her cage door open with no one there to look after her!    Is she fluffed out really big?  Look at her vent (where she poops)--if the feathers are clean and the droppings look normal you may not have anything to worry about. IF the tail feathers are dirty or she has discharge around her eyes or nose, you should take her to the vet, just to be safe.     She just might be a little tired from adjusting to her new home.  You most often won't see budgie drink--that doesn't mean that they're not.  But, it doesn't hurt to be safe.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	Donna O has given you some great advice. I just want to add...  you mention handfeeding the budgie when you get home. So...how old was it when you bought it ? It may not be getting fed often enough depending on its age. Budgie babies should not be sold unless they are old enough to eat for themselves and fly.   Check its bottom as advised...if at all poopy it is a sign it is either sick or not eating enough.|`|naijqNojaa	my budgies does that too. they just hait to be in the cage. why dont you clip their wings and leave the cage open, this way you dont have worry about them flying away and they can get in the cage whenever they want to eat.   i dont know if its gonna work for your budgie, but that works for mines.|`|OmkxSKTwaa	I think what he means by "when i hand feed her" Is by putting some feed in his hand or some millet spray up to his bird, and having it eat out of his hand.
TSc8OE4vaa	Five months is a good benchmark for 100% but some are good at 4 months.  I had one German shepherd puppy who was SO smart, she was house trained within two weeks of us having her at home.  She had trouble holding her bladder but she always came and whined when she needed to go out.|`|okdPuy1Kaa	Around 7 months they usually stop having "accidents" in the house, although they can be pretty close accident-free in a few weeks if you potty train the RIGHT way.... (Take a training class! They are great!)    Puppies should never be away from their mother before the 8 week mark-- the longer the better!  Make sure you let her out at night-- every few hours!!! NO puppy that young can hold it all night!|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	I figure 7 months for fully house trained.  that is about the age that they have adult bladder control|`|NKNJm5uSaa	Crating is always best when you are unable to supervise.  It keeps your pup safe and out of trouble.  They can get into and eat the weirdest stuff!    As for potty training, rule of thumb is about five months.  Some train faster than others, especially if you're home during the day and can get her on a routine.  If you work a lot, it may take a bit longer.
nzgZR6onaa	Maybe when it left it was still in the neighborhood at a neighbors house and it was just out and about and happened upon your Grandma's house. Something similar happened to us that's why I suggested this sinnero.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Probably someone had it has an indoor cat all that time.  I do hope if your grandmother is going to keep this cat she intends to keep it INDOORS where cats belong?    I feel sorry for the people that had her all this time.  Since they've taken care of it for the past year they've probably got signs up looking for it.  And I would bring the cat back to them if they do.  Obviously your grandmother didn't care very much for this cat if it was allowed to free roam and wasn't microchipped.|`|ZO6QXAY5aa	Oh my gosh! That is so weird. Maybe one of her neighbors took it in and made him their pet and then he got out and came back. I have no idea. That's crazy! I bet she's glad to have em back huh?|`|pAxV2GA0aa	What probably happened was someone found the cat after it disappeared the first time and took it home and made it their pet. What I now think happened is the cat escaped from the other home and found it's way back to your Grandma's house.|`|A1vdJ0huaa	?
Mrs4JG9taa	CALM not come...|`|bN0Imp99aa	More exercise! One hour walk every day. Other side activities you can do are:  -Jog  -Bike  -Rollerblade  -Fetch  -Free romp in a large field  -Hike  -Flyball  -Agility  -Skijoring if you have snow  -Obedience (even learning new tricks helps exercise them mentally as well as physically)  Just have fun with your dog and keep him active! Lots of walks! :)|`|okH04Nhlaa	Get him fixed|`|PBYYIl9Maa	wear him out, physically, by walking him/her and playing with him/her. eventually, they'll get tired and sleep. puppies are always pretty rambunctious. what breed is the puppy?|`|aBpEPOCdaa	I have two hyper dogs...here's the secret:    EXERCISE & OBEDIENCE every single day.    Most dogs were bred to perform some kind of work, way back when.  Its in their genes.  They need the daily exercise and obedience from you to work their energy off.    Good luck.|`|lVgqoOYsaa	The reason your dog is hyper is because he has too much energy  to calm him down:  -run him on the treadmill  -on walks run or jog  -long exercises in the backyard or park  also make sure the energy you project is calm-submissive  if you energy is excited your dog will pick that up    also when you pick up your dogs toy or leash don't say " Lets go on a walk" or "Come on boy"  this makes your dog excited.  when doing these things make your dog sit or lay then proceed with what your doing.    this should help you out a lot  GOOD LUCK:)|`|q0vKbocHaa	Do you take him on LOONG walks? If not that explains everything, he needs to get worn out. This will sound dumb but is he neutered? If he isn't that could also account for some of the hyperness, but even if he does get neutered he will still need a long walk|`|fYPhlnPcaa	He needs to be walked or ran a lot more. He has energy that needs to be released. If you can't walk him more, give him to a better home.
AA11193920	Sweetie, I wouldn't.    If your dog has an underbite, then chances are that he will pass that defect on to his puppies. If the female dog has the same defect, then the puppies would most definitely have it too.    Worst case scenario would be that you get one, or several puppies with a massive underbite and they would not be able to eat properly and die of starvation. It would be too much of a risk. I would never be able to take that risk.|`|PM23RDycaa	He's a mix, he shouldn't be bred PERIOD.    And yes dogs with underbites should not be bred.    Get your dog fixed.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	DO NOT breed mutts. your dog is a mix so should not be bred. NO reputable breeder breeds mutts.  and an underbite is another reason not to be bred. Its a genetic defect that will present in the puppies    Please educate your self about breeding because obviously you have never done research. YOU will BE a BYB, and thats not a good thing.|`|2O58btqxaa	no do not breed him get him done there are enough unwanted dogs around|`|0SHAY9TQaa	No. You should NEVER breed a mutt. Spay your dog for goodness sakes!    Read these websites:  http://www.chowwelfare.com/cciw/breeddog...    http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/breeding.h...    Don't add to the overpopulation of unwanted animals. Have you looked in shelters lately? They are FULL of mutts, all on death row. Instead, adopt. Don't litter, spay and neuter!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Of course not!    No good breeder would ever breed a dog with an underbite.    But then no good breeder would ever breed a mutt, either.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Definitely not.    He is a cross bred companion dog, with a major fault for breeding. Unless there is a practical purpose for crossing two distinct purebred dogs { for example a working lurcher} then breeding it's advisable to spay/castrate rather than breed a litter.    I couldn't open the photo, but as I had a Bedlington with an underbite  I know what it looks like. It never bothered my Beddie & he was a great companion dog. Enjoy your dog & consider castrating him.|`|QUkXsPNIaa	NO    neuter him|`|Mcf33eLbaa	I can`t bring up the picture.  But why in the world would you want to breed a mixed breed dog?  The pound is full of mixes that don`t have a home.  Before doing this be sure you can get rid of the pups to a good home.  As well consider neutering your dog.  Good Luck and God Bless|`|F27az9NEaa	Why would you breed him in the first place?  Breeding is not something to be taken lightly.  But I won't even go into that whole speech, because you have a mixed breed dog.  Why breed a mutt? To create more mutts? Do you know how many mixed (and purebred) dogs that die every year because there "aren't enough homes?"  Do you really want to contribute to that?|`|vFCQcRNEaa	Of course not! That is a severe genetic defect, and unless your dog is titled and health tested you shouldn't be breeding it anyway. You will just contribute even more to the pet overpopulation problem...    Breeding for no reason is quite stupid. There are millions of animals in shelters that are euthanized each year because they are unwanted. If you breed your dog and it's puppies have a genetic problem that costs thousands of dollars to fix, do you think they would get adopted? Of course not! You need to find a good mentor, that knows a lot about your breed, and they can school you even more on why not to breed your dog.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	NO! You shouldn't breed him even if he didn't have an under bite. Don't we have enough unwanted animals in this world now? Please DO NOT contribute to the problem.|`|S9B8Fr4daa	no you should not.  He would fail when it comes to being of breeding quality.  Please neuter him. Save a few dogs lives.  You'll feel better in the end.|`|LSzGCNjDaa	Dont breed him.  not because of his teeth.  But if you watch the aspca commercial you see so many unwanted dogs, and breeding helps make more unwanted dogs|`|mTTPLly4aa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|q0vKbocHaa	ok well hes a mix! There are WAAY to many dogs out there n shelters looking for a home than for you to go breed your mutt. Besdies on top of that he has an underbite, even if he was from show lines and a purebred he shouldn't be bred. Gosh I hate it when people want to breed their MUTT
ITnQEUQTaa	Most dogs enjoy vegetables or fruit as a treat but they shouldn't make up a major part of their diet.  Dogs cannot digest them very well and most of the nutrients pass straight through.    Read the links below and next time she spouts off with stuff like this you will have all the right answers :-))|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	Believe it or not, due to domestication by humans, dogs have developed teeth for chewing vegetables.|`|PM23RDycaa	Sure they can but they come back out like they went in. Dogs don't have the proper intestine length to digest vegetation like humans and herbivores do. So really they don't need them.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Dogs can eat vegetables, wont hurt them generally speaking, but they are not able to properly digest them.  Which basically means, they'll come out the other end looking the same as they did when they went in.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	carrots and broccoli  both have vitamins that are good for dogs and are okay in moderation. A dog's primary diet though should be meat, high in protein. Do Not give a dog corn or peanuts though. Many dogs develop allergies to these.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	Well sho nuff powder puff.|`|3p3otDlXaa	Yes.  Of course.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Sure they can, they can have some fruit too. My dogs love lettuce, oranges, apples and carrots.|`|xz1Eqm47aa	Make sure to stay away from onions and grapes because those are toxic.|`|7qqVTwJ2aa	Yes, dogs can eat vegetables. Believe it or not, vegetables and fruits are actually good for dogs. However, there are a select few of which dogs can't eat such as grapes. They are toxic and have been known to cause upset stomachs. Dogs DO absorb the nutrients from vegetables and fruits even if it passes right back out into their stool. The same happens in human bowel movements (i.e. corn).
hEXb1unraa	Pantyhose are a perfect solution, they are cheap, they breathe, they are strong and its what I use.|`|8K8yIRLXaa	I really don't like lyrca for tail bags. I've found they either slide right out or cause some strange oddness with my horse's tail (The tail bunches in the bag and causes mats). Given the choice, I tend to use polar fleece or cotton for a tail bag. I like the polar fleece for tail bags, because it's easy to use and stays in.     One of the perks of tail bags is they keep the tail clean. That said, I can't imagine that a pantyhose tail bag would keep it clean, because of the holes. You'd end up with a dirtier tail than if you left it down. Plus, pantyhose would rip easily (just like it does on your legs) so you'd always be replacing it.    Just my 2 cents|`|KMMK6RZSaa	Pantyhose is a good idea, and some people used tube socks, as the cotton breathes as well.    Or, you could divide the tail into several sections, put each section into a figure 8 knot, and then wrap some vet wrap around each knot.  Sometimes this will be better than a tail bag as the horse can get its tail caught and rip out hair.  The knot method seems to be more forgiving and instead of ripping out, it just pulls loose.      But if you don't want to do that, the pantyhose or tube socks will work.  Also, just so you know, there is a lot of lycra on Ebay.  I've gotten some one there before for a really good price.|`|9LSZfzzxaa	I used a cotton sheet, ripped into three strips.  It is a little tricky to braid in, but once done well it can be left in for a long time.  I like to wash and dry the tail first, comb out completely, and spray with a good leave in conditioner such as healthy hair.  Then braid the tail bag in.
DdpvxfkNaa	Yeah it is a good website :)|`|7zNWPuCBaa	its not there when i loaded it... but its a good idea i guess.|`|Hm5SCDv4aa	Yah, just now.  It's a good idea.  Like that freerice.com site where they give 10 grains of rice for every right answer to UNWFP.|`|LSzGCNjDaa	yeah, its a good way help.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Yes, every day, for both the dog and cat questions.  It is a very simple way of helping other animals.  And from the questions asked, one can even learn new things.
0SHAY9TQaa	I own a Shih Tzu :)    Honestly, I prefer them over Yorkies. My next door neighbor owns a Yorkie. Her dog barks much more than my Shih Tzu. Anyways, you have to TRAIN a dog not to bark.    Both breeds can be good dogs, I just prefer Shih Tzu's :)    Please adopt from petfinder.com    Good Luck!    (ADD:)    Here is a picture of Coco, my shih tzu!  http://tinypic.com/usermedia.php?uo=JfEM...|`|LJkPRqN0aa	100% YORKIE!!!!!!!! Shih Tzu's acttualy scare me and are quite lazy in my opinion. every Shih Tzu ive came to know or see have this eye problem where their eyes can actually pop out of their sockets and that just creeps me out..      the ONE thing i will warn you about yorkies is that they are (and i quote from the vet) the hardest dogs to potty train. BUT we have come to discover that if you get a doggie door they learn to use that fairly quick. we didnt discover this until almost a year of accidents in the house. and after a day of us training her in the doggie door she now realizes she can go in and out AND can use the lawn as her toilet. very simple.. i wish we learned that earlier.... but yorkies are so much fun!|`|uQrIdrjfaa	neither lab and thumbs up me this time meanies|`|PAZWfnFtaa	They're both going to bark plenty.  I think shih tzus are cuter, personally.|`|IKX1QtUBaa	They both are adorable. It depends on the personality for the dog on how it will bark or not .|`|D1beU6MPaa	I have owned both and as far as them being cute, they both are. Yorkies are terriers and do bark a lot. Both of mine thought they were rottweilers. Afraid of nothing, and I do mean nothing. Shih Tzu's do bark but not as much as the Yorkies. They are a bit easier to train, but do require grooming. I have three of them and all three have very good personalities. They are all males and they all get along well with other dogs. Here is a picture of my three.    http://i267.photobucket.com/albums/ii301...|`|JkX8xqXYaa	Shih Tzus for sure!!!!! I have a shih tzu and she is amazing!!!  They arne't yippy like yorkies and they are pretty calm!
45e02f98828bf1f1f04987f503111641aa	By the sounds of it you have a cat that adores you. My cat acts very much the same way your describing. Minus the pawing the face while sleeping, I think that would get a little annoying. He is showing his love for you. You are blessed to have a kitty who loves you so much.|`|10eguzBCaa	he loves you awww bless|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I am secure in the knowledge that as long as I feed my cat and keep it from the elements that it will 'love' me.|`|iCdnucujaa	I think he loves you!!!|`|sGv3RebZaa	Well, he certainly sounds like a loving and affectionate animal. If he is just doing all that because you feed him, he certainly knows how to say "Thank you"    I have two cats, Teddy Graham and Reeses, and both of them are like that. I think it is more than just because I feed them, they're both affectionate with me and with each other. So, enjoy the fact that you have such a loving cat and make sure that he knows you love him too.|`|6fG8j5xpaa	A cat who says : I love you, or like you blinks slowly at you. Purring is a way to show affection, showing belly is a way for cats to also show affection or love. A cat who is very close often see that person as a mother figure, or a close mate. My cat sleeps in my bed every night and comes running meowing at me when I come home. Is because I got it as a very tiny kitten and took care of it as a mother. Mine also sucks on my hair.     But as I said above, the slow blinking is a sign.|`|zpwJR60baa	I am a cat behavior. When a cat tails swing up and side to side they emotion are happy.  When they are still, and purr for you they are happy.  Happy = Love  Content = Love  Follow you to every room means Love...    Get enough hint from us???  :-)  enjoy their love!
XT35nFmiaa	my pug didnt like eating, but he eats more now. what we did that helped was:         add in treats, like chicken         give him baby foo mixed with slightly hot water. that sounds              weird, but it works         the stinker the food the better.        encourage him, and get him excited about eating.|`|ww59ahwYaa	If he is small thats probably why|`|VZORldZKaa	change the dogs food see if there is any change, but only change his/her food not all dogs.|`|W7lEg8Yxaa	actually only eating when u are hungry is normal- and healthy. He is fine. If u start to notice he is not drinking or going to the bathroom- then take him to the vet.    No- thats not true lol. a dog eats when its hungry and thats that, there is no need to scarf down food if you know when u are hungry next time there will be food there for you. You are just not used to it.  There is nothing wrong with ure dog, dont make it more complicated than that.  He is just different than your others.  I have had dogs for over 20 years, all of them different eating habits. your vet wasnt worried, y are you?    I know pugs very well, u should be comfortable with the fact that ure dog feels safe enough that he doesnt have to scarf food down. You should be happy not worried. Im not trying to argue with you, but u are making a problem out of nothing. Your dog is perfect.|`|YL48wxWXaa	if itz small then when ever it feels hungry it will eat .. u feed it when ever it is hungry ...|`|cSpTN4Wpaa	maybe he's pugarexic|`|2cb452ad1394f4b424e3b72e7818648faa	cook some bone less chicken and mixed it with the food , that might help ... good luck

283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	males more so than females. the anatomy of the urethra is slightly different which causes males to be more prone to blockages than females.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Males.  I've owned several cats over the years.  I've only had 2 males that got an UTI once (Charlie, my Oci,; and Mitten, my first cat).|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Males tend to get blockages/UTI's more frequently. Yes, providing wet food is /very/ good. In fact, dry food is often the culprit when it comes to urinary issues in cats and feeding an all wet diet is healthiest.    The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Does Dry Food Clean the Teeth?)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.      Darksong~|`|BFB51h78aa	Also, dry foods seem to promote UTIs.|`|c4f8a63972685e95e511d29969f672a3aa	MALEs do....my cat had it twice and almost died both times. You also want to give them LOW ASH food.  You can get Hills Feline CD for this too.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Males can get blocked...and it can be deadly.  If ever your male cat ever acts like it's trying to urinate and cat, call your Vet and get him in ASAP.  But males and females can both get UTI's.
CdPWH4vcaa	Haha its sounds like my gelding. Ah he's a babe lol  Actually he's a real jerk. But he's very loving and he has to be the most particular horse i have ever seen haha    Well from my experience you really just have to MAKE him do it. Invest in spurs and a crop.    Or if he decides to buck alot then simply get off. Lunge him a bit then get back on.    Or if he just stops in the middle of a feild or something your best bet is to get off, Make him walk to a place with soft mushy ground (incase of getting thrown ;p) Then jump up on him and push him as in just kick with your heels squeeeeeze with your legs and such.  It sounds very dificult but in the end its really worthwhile.  I love my pony now. He is great.|`|AA12189965	well girl hes got you number!!! you have let him get away with the well im only working 40 mins and if you want more im going to buck you off!!    and its working becuse you probly freak everytime he baulks or bucks so hes got you figured out.. next time dont let him get away with it if he baulks and bucks let him but MAKE him continue to work dont stop tell hes figured out he aint getting away with ****

iiNAJfGCaa	First off "tucking his head" and going "on the bit" are COMPLETELY different things. A horse can only go on the bit when they have the correct muscling and yes, training. To truly go on the bit they do more than arch their neck down (although this is what it looks like to an inexperienced eye). They are actually engaging themselves from behind, pushing up through their back, stretching through their topline and flexing at the poll. This is something that is achieved through lots of time, patience, and practice for both the horse and the rider. Does your horse stretch down in to the bridle during his warm up? This is the first step. See if you can get him to stretch his nose towards the ground while really moving forward from behind. Your reins can be relatively loose and you will control him mostly with your seat and legs. This is also a great way to start to build up his back and hind end which will eventually allow him to go on the bit correctly. Don't get caught up on having him go in a "fake frame!" It will certainly look pretty but if he is just tucking his nose to his chest he is NOT going on the bit. Ask your trainer if you could have a few lessons on an old school master (if one is available) so you are able to really feel a horse who is on the bit and how to ask for it correctly before you begin teaching your arab.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Last answer is a good one!  I would add, keep the bit moving in his mouth constantly by "twiddling" your fingers as fast as you can.  This really helps with my stubborn old mare.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	It isn't possible to be perfectly schooled and never have been taught to go on the bit.  It sounds like has been incorrectly schooled.  The only effective way to fix this is to go back to basic snaffle bit training, getting him to stretch out and reach forward, then ride him long and low as you encourage him to reach down for the bit as he develops the muscles to elevate his back.  In order to bring him onto the bit, he needs to be reaching for it.  This might require some help from a good instructor to show you how it is done.  Not all trainers know the dressage basics that your horse will benefit from.  If you can forego your usual lessons to bring in a trainer in basic dressage to guide you in getting this started, you won't regret it.  Literally everything you do with your horse in the future will be improved by going back and training these basics now.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Well if you want him to tuck his head, also known as breaking at the pole. Gently seesaw your reins until his head tucks and then reward him. Repeat, repeat, repeat ,repeat, repeat.     Various schooling devices such as martingales and tie-downs can be useful as well.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	tell him that it's time to say grace
TtOCh3JSaa	I wouldn't worry, it's normal for the stitches to swell a little bit, it's like getting pricked with a needle and no need to take her to the vet as long as the incision is not bleeding heavily. I would recommend you make her wear a cone if you have it, to stop her licking the wound tonight and let her sleep on your bedroom floor so you can keep an eye on her. See how she is tomorrow if you notice any other stitches popping, bring her back to the VET.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	This does seem normal because my dog just gotten spayed the vet said don't worry just keep her still and don't let her lick it or move around alot.|`|HRI8BhS6aa	watch for redness which is inflammation response and can mean an infection is a potential risk..............puppys are never calm unless drugged or asleep.. they don't know they had surgery....    if she popped a stich its OK.....just make sure she stays out of dirt and mud and doesn't stay outside for potty duty very long at all.....    Just call the vet in the morning, tell them at stich came lose, or 2 and they should tell you to just watch the incision site.... she should be just fine    Good job on getting puppy spayed!!!!!!!!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You can call it doesn't cost but one of mine did the same thing & was fine. As long as the incision looks good & swollen is fine, I wouldn't worry unless it is bleeding or oozing.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	i think shes fine just dont let her touch or lick the stichs my old dog licked them and stuff and had to get stiched up again he had to wear a cone for 2 weeks|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Call your vet and ask them to repeat the aftercare instructions to you.    Why did you spay her so young? She should have had at least another month intact.    EDIT: Your vet is nuts... any decent vet recommends 6 months. I've never been to a vet who recommended anything below 6 months.|`|1d9TrIKCaa	Don't worry my pup did that when she got surgery...They forget about it, you don;t really need to go to a vet....She is just confused as to why there are plastic things attatched to her belly|`|0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	OK don't mean to sound harsh but your not supposed to let her run around and play for several days after being spayed.  You have to be the one in charge because your puppy does not know that her uterus and ovaries were just removed.  There are several layers of sutures but you still have to limit her activity to prevent a hernia or worse the sutures inside coming loose.  Put the E collar on her and place her in her crate for the night and go see her vet in the morning.  EDIT:  5 months is not to young to spay your dog.  We usually start around 4 months.  You want to have your pet spayed before it cycles to reduce the risk of breast cancer later on.  EDIT: Please take anything you read on here with a grain of salt.  Not every one on YA is what or who they say they are.  Do your own research and trust your vet since hes the one that spent all those years in school actually learning how to take care of peoples pets.
Apisf1gAaa	Okay what shade of pink are we talking about here?  Are we talking about little girl's room, ballerina slippers, and barbie doll pink?  Or like a deeper, fuschia-ish pink color?  If its the former, it sounds like he was molting.  You need to leave him alone.  If its the latter, then it sounds like your hermit crab has finished molting, and has changed colors.  It happens.|`|ivlOxlG6aa	only if he was originally like that. If not see a vet or google it.|`|LXxxAzIqaa	If you didn't buy him that way then no it is not normal and you should Google it.|`|qNU6QPj8aa	yes i would think it is.    i guess|`|ae73541672d371e87ebedfb3fa8b29f0aa	I bought hermit crabs in Atlantic City and they paint them that way.

His skin still hasn't hardened enough to have a better color.  Perfectly normal, my little Rob came out a pink wonder. :)  Give them some honey and foods rich in chitin, protein, and calcium and leave him alone.  Your other hermit crabs will eventually do this as well.|`|r0u26SYGaa	2 of my hermits are pink, its normal, don't worry about it, he probably molted, and by the way, hermit crabs are social creatures and need room mates so you should get another.

904a4f36d1f39931cc65858631890b36aa	It's not overtly in their nature to hate each other. Some animals can co-habitat with no problem naturally, while others will be more violent towards each other. Its just dependent upon to demeanor of the animal. My mother in law has a tabby cat who rules her house & will actually take a nap with her dog. Whereas my neighbors Bengal cat doesn't get along with his neighbors dachshund.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	I really don't know exactly, but good question. It's funny my dog that we had was scared to death of my cat, you think it'd be the other way around lol. I guess it just depends on the animal as an individual.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Nah....cats and dogs really do get along.  Cats will rule though...usually.  Cats can actually be the pack leader if there are dogs in the house.  The Dog whisperer had a show one day about a cat that died and the dog was lost and had behavior problems because he depended on the cat to give him his boundaries.  Without that cat...he went bonkers.  Biting the chairs and growing and biting etc.      I have had cats here after I had dogs and they always get along.  The dogs get too close and the cats back them off real quick.  Right now I have my son's cat Eclipse and she is a three legged cat and she rules over three dogs!  :)))   She lays in the hallway sideways and just flips her tail back and forth and back and forth DARING them to cross her.  She is DECLAWED  too so she can't hurt them...but they don't know that.       You don't have to train them...just let them figure it out themselves...they have to decide the pack order...even if they are cats and dogs.    I actually feel sorry for male dogs.  The cats rule them...and then female dogs should be the pack leaders ...so there is peace....    that is what three different vets told me and I let it go and that is what has happened.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	if you bring them up together they will be fine. also if you have a bigger dog and a kitten it will be ok. it all depends and how you do it but mostly they grow up together.|`|g6tku4aVaa	my pet's do that  1. my dog is stupid (i think) and i think he thinks it's the same species..hahahahaha  2.  my cat loves playing with my dog..my dog hates it..they get along though  3. they were not trained|`|qNU6QPj8aa	if they get ussed to each other then they are fine lol. my cat and dog get along fine|`|uXQcDsiAaa	Becuase they were never manipulated into thinking they were enemies
c1399a0d75e7cc276f7e97d85f90618caa	The eel will try to eat anything that'll fit in it's mouth, not to mention they can get huge.  So, I would suggest not getting the eel for now.    Seahorses need tanks that are bigger vertically than they are horizontally, because of the way they swim and whatnot, so you may want to wait on it.    Anemones can be highly sensitive to water quality, and can become vicious if you don't feed them enough, so you may want to wait on it, too.    Everything else should be fine together, but it would be overstocked if you got everything on your list.  Just make sure that, whatever you do get, put it in according to who would be where in the tank.  The ones staying in the lower levels (the hawkfish) should go first, followed by middle, and then top.  For the shrimp and scallop, it shouldn't matter what order you put them in, but I would say put them in first.    Good luck with your tank, it sounds like a good set-up. :)|`|Y43nptlvaa	Your good except the eel.. bad idea hope i helped
GduRpnn0aa	It does sound like your cat may have an allergy. Have you changed her food recently? For allergies you can give your cat Stimmune as it is a herbal formulation that helps to alleviate cat allergies by maintaining natural balance within the body and by stimulating the immune system. It can also be used to treat recurrent infections and fatigue.    Here is the link: http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-allergie...    Allergies are the most common illnesses affecting cats. They are caused by changed lifestyles, including food and environment. Cat allergies are characterized by the body's abnormal reaction to internal or external stimuli and are caused by many different factors. Allergic reactions can be different from one cat to another, even for the same allergen (agent). Sometimes, these allergens are in the cats own body, causing the body to react against itself such as in auto-immune diseases. It is important to try to find the cause for cat allergies, even though it can be difficult. Along with working towards finding the cause, the use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms, and also to strengthen the immune system.    Common Symptoms of Cat Allergies:    Skin problems (the most common evidence of allergic reaction)   Eruptions, redness and itchiness of the skin and swelling of the affected area   Digestive problems (such as diarrhea and gas)|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	She may have a kitty cold or another virus.

It won't do any good and may cause more harm. What are you doing that for anyway? Call the vet tomorrow if you can't wait until the 20th. It's better to have something taken care of BEFORE your cat is scheduled for surgery. If it is an illness, the surgery would be postponed until the cat is better.|`|MGxDgsKZaa	I don't know what the problem is, but when I have a question like that I call the vet. Often they can give you some basic advice over the phone without you having to pay for an extra appointment (especially since they know you're going to be paying for services later in the month). If they've seen the cat before, they might even prescribe a medicine that you can go in and pick up without bringing in the cat. Good luck!
RJyrBJvxaa	"livin the dream" is in her own "dream world"  You know what they say, "Ignorance is bliss!"     You need to get control of your dog.  Watch a few episodes of "Dog Whisperer"      Twice Daily walks (30-60min) and socialization will do your dog some good.  Owning a dog takes a lot of time and energy.  You need to assert yourself and your boyfriend as the leaders of the group.    About the food thing...Your dog is probably recently aggressive with his food because he feels he is the pack leader.  I can stick my face in my dogs food bowl while she is eating and she will not make a sound.  She'll wait until I let her know it is OK.  I did that by making her sit, then lay down, then sit before putting her bowl down in front of her.  She didn't eat until I told her to "Go get it".  During feeding time, I would tell her to sit and take her bowl then go through the commands again.  I would stick my face in her food and if she growled or showed any aggression I took her down to a submissive position so she knew not to be aggressive with her food.  Same with the bone.  Take the bone away and NEVER EVER let him win the bone out of your hands.  Give a command like "Out" when taking the bone.    Another thing, don't be shy or passive when training your dog (Don't beat him either!!!  That doesn't help anything.)  Be calm and assertive.  Best time to train your dog is after a long walk.  Your dog needs to know who is boss.  Screaming doesn't help either.  Let me know if you have any questions via email.  I'm not a trainer, just have an obedient Pitbull.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Pitties are usually fairly calm if raised properly and living in a loving home. It sounds to me like he just gradually started getting out of control because you have other priorities. Why not try taking him to pet training?

I really hope he doesn't end up in a shelter!|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	'Pitties are bad news'    You should be dropped into the sea with weights on your ankles.    Pits are good dogs!

But you don't sound like a responsible pet owner.  Take him to obedience class.  He needs discipline.  Maybe steer clear of getting another animal unless it comes in a box with batteries and a manual.

It's very sad to see that people who have no idea what they are talking about are spreading false information. Secondly, why don't you try obedience training? There's no need to give your dog to just anybody because you don't want to spend time training him. It's very unfair on your dog, and chances are he will be passed from home to home until eventually someone gives him to a shelter where he will be euthanised for no good reason. You should never have gotten a dog if you weren't prepared to stick with it through thick and thin. I'm sorry if I come across as rude, but this is all too common and a breed like the pitbull shouldn't be carelessly given away to whoever you can find online to take him. I think you are an unfit dog owner and I hope you don't consider another pet unless you are willing to give it a permanent home, not just a place to stay until you get sick of it.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	This is a terrible place to advertise.

They are better choice until your puppy grow out of the teething age.    Alternative would be spraying the leash you have with Bitter Apple (buy from most pet store) and it will taste bad to them and he probably would not chew it anymore.      Try to keep the leash away from him when you are not walking him so he wouldn't chew it and give him lots of other chew toys such as Kong or rope bones.  If he chews on the leash when you are walking then clap your hand and say NO firmly.  When he stops give him a treat.  He will eventually learn not to chew it anymore|`|MuD5oXQQaa	When your puppy starts biting on the leash stop her.

I am sure she is okay... maybe try the flyers again...  someone might have found this cat, fell in love with it and maybe never saw your ADS...  don't give up!!!|`|nzgZR6onaa	Why don't you put your missing feline on the local news with a small reward but don't tell how much of a reward and then maybe the next person who see's your kitty will catch and hold onto it till you can make arangements to pick it up.Just make sure they call the tv station and not you as you could get some real freaks that like to play pranks.GOOD LUCK!
eTsCJYALaa	Obviously she lied about the deworming. Honestly I would not trust anyone who travelled out of state to sell her puppies. I would guess that she had some issues selling dogs in her own state. If for some reason she actually signed her real name on the CKC registration forms (highly unlikely) I would report her to the association. Most puppy mills and backyard breeders use the CKC instead of the AKC because they were denied membership. Good luck with your pup and luckily he was bought by someone willing to pay for the medical bills.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	YES, this is a red flag backyard breeder!  The CKC is a fake registry... well it's real but you don't need any proof other than a photo so it's easy to fake, your dog might not even be pure.  No self-respecting breeder registers through the CKC.  AKC is the American kennel club and it's the only kennel club in the united states that is trustworthy.  Even AKC breeders can be byb'ers but it's a lot less likely because the AKC has higher standards.    Another red flag is that she had three litters at once.  Breeding dogs takes a lot of time and effort, it is hard to believe that she has the time to give proper attention to three litters at once.  Unless she is a professional kennel (which she obviously isn't) she is a BYB.    Did she guarantee a healthy puppy?  If she did you can get money back or take her to court for selling you an unhealthy puppy.    Good luck with your puppy, hopefully she will be okay!    Also, I doubt she was actually from another state... just a typical lying back-yard breeder.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	I agree with the others. Also if the pup had received its first shots you would get the vet certificate saying so with the pup. Screams puppy mill. No self respecting breeder would transport 13 young puppies over state lines to a  friends house to sell them. She may have bought up cheap puppies that looked mostly German Shepherd but aren't purebred and has pulled this stunt to get a profit. Sorry about the beginnings with your pup and this shonky dealer, but better the pup with you now than the previous owner.|`|2bZMxMitaa	I wouldn't doubt it. Tell everyone you know not to buy puppies from her! Poor little things :(
YqVtOSWwaa	No. I wouldn't even consent to the replication of pets the natural way. There are more than enough homeless pets that end up getting euthanized, so if you want to get another pet, take one of those. No sense in producing more.    Aside from that reason, I do not see the purposeful value in cloning or what good it will serve me. All I can see is it being a really expensive dent in my wallet, lol.     It has its potential of doing good in the medical field (mainly for organ parts) but as far as we see today, there is no reason to clone whole animals other than to continue experimentation, which I do support for the sake of expanding our knowledge.|`|tQN4lGKOaa	NO...cloning is evil works of the Devil..|`|g5RS83paaa	I would, my dog is 8 and she's is perfect. I heard about them cloning dogs overseas, I would defiantly be interested in doing it with my dog|`|gZn622dEaa	No because It just doesn't sound right.|`|g1155MhXaa	NO,it is really not natural and is unethical. I think it is a great advance in science and maybe they can discover how to clone extinct animals.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Sure, you'd get your beloved pet back and get the chance to fix any mistakes you made the first time. You'd just have to remember that your cloned pet isn't going to be exactly the same as the original. If I could I'd clone my oldest cat and my Basenji Schnauzer mix|`|8qECRiuMaa	yes i love my dog and i never want her to leave me|`|au8twjpJaa	yeah I would clone them so I could always have them around, and never have to find a new animal again.   That is unless they turn out evil like the cat on pet cemetery...  Then I would have to kill the cat and rebury it, which I hate doing|`|cXs6ccT6aa	no....cloning is not the answer|`|Kgi2RxhBaa	I would never clone my cats. For one thing, even if two animals are genetically identical, that doesn't mean they'll have the same personalities. Look at identical twin people; they're very distinct and unique individuals. Personality is determined by environment as well as genes, so there is no way to clone personality.    Secondly, losing a pet is very sad, but getting a new pet is a new adventure every time. My cat George died a couple years ago, and last spring I adopted a new cat. She's nothing like George, but she has her own quirks and adorableness that make me love her as much as I loved him.    Thirdly, why would I want to pay over $100,000 for an artificially created life, when there are thousands of wonderful pets in shelters looking for a good home?
77lIzq4Taa	What is the dogs quality of life? Is he still happy? Can he function, eat move, with out help? Are you spending all your time just trying to keep him comfortable? Is it in his best interest to stay with you or to be euthanized so he is at peace? These are all questions you have to answer honestly. Your pet is the main concern. You have had him for an extreme amount of time it is hard to make a decision this important and remain neutral. Don't confuse age with quality of life.|`|76nTvO4iaa	My vet's yardstick for whether a dog should be put down:    1.  Do they still perk up when they hear you getting the food bowl out?  Are they still eating and drinking ok?    2.  Are the able to walk well enough (even though they may need some help getting up sometimes) to go outside and take care of their bodily functions?    3.  Are any serious age (arthritis) or disease (cancer) related pains treatable with mild medication?    4.  Even though they sleep a lot, do they still seem to be enjoying life with you?    If the answer to all 4 questions is "Yes" the dog is not ready to be put down.    When 2 or more of the questions become "No," it's time to make the hard decision that all loving, responsible pet owners have to make at some point.|`|um5CVvTfaa	Old age isn't a reason on it's own to put a dog down.  I had a GSP that lived to be 17.  She did die of a cardio incident on her own.  I wish my parents had spared her those hours of pain.  She deserved better.|`|aBqJhdufaa	Putting down anything is COMPLETELY WRONG!!! Like how would you like it if some random person said everyone older than 70 will now be shot? It's just EVIL. :(    Okay what's wrong with mine?????|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Age alone shouldn't be a reason to put an animal to sleep. However if they are in pain and suffering or miserable due to medical issues (not being able to walk, etc) then yes I do believe it is our obligation (not right) to put them to sleep in a humane way. Allowing them to suffer is cruel.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Depends on if they are in pain or not. We just let my 19 year old cat pass away on her own in our house over the summer but that's because she wasn't in pain, just slower than she used to be. If they are in pain, it is kind to put them down.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	I think putting him to sleep is necessary if he's ill or in incurable pain. If not hell no! Let him live out his days and let nature take it's course.    Tell your family members to mind their own or you'll put them down.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Is he sick?  Dogs can live healthily into their 20s|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	you shouldnt put any animal to sleep unless its in agony and already dying like if its really sick or injured and there is no hope at all|`|PYraGxKraa	if he is healthy let him live if he is sick then maybe you should put him down so he doesnt have to suffer|`|9f3784bdf3bdc20b62d4d53dedacfdfeaa	If the animal is in pain or suffering, then yes, you should put him down (it is very humane).  However, if he/she is just aging and can get around and they are still themselves, then keep them as long as possible :)  I have to huskies that are only 5 but I can never imagine putting them down unless it was just obvious that they were no longer enjoying life|`|zn0pXkc0aa	Listen to your vet and discuss the situation with him/her. Only your vet knows your dog's health, and you do too, therefore it should be a joint decision.    Personally, I do not believe our pets should suffer. It is cruel to allow an animal to die a slow painful death when we could prevent it by humanely putting the pet down.    Our pets love us, depend on us, and sometimes need our help when crossing over.    It is never easy, I've cried buckets of tears, after each pet I've had put down; but it was the BEST for the pet concerned.    The rest is for you to decide as I can NOT make that decision for you.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	If he's not eating or drinking.  If he's not able to get around as well....It's basically a matter of "Is his quality of life still good?"  Just because he's old doesn't mean he automatically gets a death sentence.  But if you know he's just not doing well then maybe it is time to let go.  You need to put the dog's best interest FIRST and foremost.  He'll be there to greet you when your time comes.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I think that if there is nothing wrong with the dog other than age, it should be allowed to live out the remainder of its life. If the dog has severe pain or arthritis or has a severely reduced quality of life in some other way, then it would best to put it down. I loved my first akita dearly, but when her arthritis got to be too much for her to take, we put her down. It's sometimes the kindest thing you can do and the most difficult decision to make as a dog owner.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	If he is not in pain or suffering disease then by all means let him live out his life.|`|Vh3v0aV4aa	I don't think you should do it if age is the only thing "wrong" with the dog. If other than age, he is relatively healthy I don't see any reason why he shouldn't be allowed to live out his life.|`|MLC97M1Baa	Sometimes they need out help, yes. My older dog had a tumor and was given 10 days to live. In that time the pain would increase so much and nothing could be done. Putting her to sleep painlessly was the best thing to do for her.   I believe in PTS method when the dog is sick or in very bad conditions. NOT when the dog got too big, or it pood in the house, etc.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	I believe that for each owner and dog the answer is different - that only the human who best knows the dog can make that  choice based on what the dog its self would wish.|`|OsuvvU68aa	If he's sick and suffering then I think it's the humane thing to do. If his joints are bad and his teeth are bad then it's merciful to put him down. Sometimes dying naturally is a painful process.|`|C7baXdSZaa	I beleive if the animal is heathy when it is older then there is NO need to put it down BUT if the animale is old and sick and seems as though it is suffering then YES there is no question about it!|`|9UttDvcsaa	I think that if your dog is suffering and in pain it is the nicest thing you can do your him.  Good Luck I am so sorry.|`|AA11334859	even though i love animals, there are two sides....  one- he is struggling, a lot... it might be a good idea  on the other hand- if h was a human, it wouldnt be right. i feel like you should let him live if he is "healthy"  if he has cancer or is deing, put him to sleep|`|qqUvoC5uaa	If the quality of life is not worth it, and your dog is in pain all of the time. It may be better to get him put down.  But I have seen many happy 17-20 year old dogs that still have a lot of life left in them.|`|37dbkLvEaa	I believe you have the duty to do it when the animal is forced to live in agony. My dog was put down at 14 because Lymph node cancer caused him to live every minute in excruciating pain.|`|18OKU8ENaa	God said we are over animals.  We are to hunt, kill, or make them our pets.    We are humans, we do what we want cause God gave us the intellect to do so!|`|s3gwur9zaa	i think that they should be able to live untill they pass away, unless they are sick and they are suffering, thats GREAT that your dog is still alive....i wouldnt put him down like i said unless he is in pain and hurting.|`|3p3otDlXaa	If he's not in pain or peeing around, keep him.  See how long he can live, yet I wouldn't argue.|`|9M2jxmv6aa	It's a tough decision but I think there is an issue of quality of life.  If a dog is in terrible, constant pain that cannot be cured, that is no way to live.  If a dog can't walk so that it has to lay in its own urine and feces, that is no way to live either.  I think you do as much as you can to make sure your dog's life is comfortable.  When his quality of life is very low and there is no hope for getting better, it is more humane to let your dog pass than have it suffer needlessly.|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	Euthanasia should usually come into play for any animal that has no sense of where it is, what is happening in its environment, has no control over its bodily functions, or is fatally ill with no hope of recovery.    Having worked in an animal hospital and its kennel, I've seen many decrepit dogs so far past their prime that we had to carry them outside for them to potty. Then we'd bring them back in and do a daily bath just to get their own urine and feces off of them.    It is selfish to keep a dog alive when it can be plainly seen that it is in severe discomfort and has no sense of its environment.    If your dog is acting healthy with no blindness, arthritis, or incontinence, you have the right to let the dog live life to its fullest degree.|`|RyNvYrJmaa	the dog shouldn't be put to sleep until it is the only fair decision for him. think back to his happiest days and pick his 3 most favorite things in the world..once these all become history for him, he probably isnt too happy anymore. and of course if pain is involved that should be a big part of your decision making.|`|sNDQCpZsaa	If your dog is in pain, I would suggest putting it down. I wouldn't want it to live its last years uncomfortably. I'm only thinking of your dog, and putting a dog to sleep would always be my last resort. If your dog shows no signs of issues, you can continue having your pet live a happy, healthy life. :)|`|74240af15f50d7d3cb1cd327aa55db84aa	If your dog is really sick it would be better to have him put to sleep. You don't want to mortgage your car to keep him alive.  If your dog is doing pretty good then just let him live out his life and be good to him.|`|DhE0rEWiaa	Just because the dog is old dose not mean that it needs to be put down. However if the dog is having medical problems has stooped eating and drinking water or loosing control of him self  or the dog is in pain and suffering, then yes the right thing to do would be put the dog to sleep. Some older dogs do go to sleep on there own and yes some have to be humanely euthanized to end the pain and suffering of the dog that's not right to let a dog just suffer in pain.     Getting older is a part of life but with that dose come some problems like cancer or like my GSD his legs just got the best of him has he got older and walking became very painful the meds were just not enough any more and when I saw that he could not get up on his own and he cry in pain as he was trying to get up, as much as it hurt me to have to put him to sleep it hurt me more to see the pain he was in..     So having to make this choice yes painful however kind to the dog to not let it suffer..|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Unless the animal is in constant pain or is constantly sick, there is no reason to put down.    Certainly age is not a reason to put down.
9kTejB0uaa	Depends on the regulations in your local area - phone your Council and ask?  Frankly I don't think it's very nice to put it out with the normal household waste and I never have.  We have doggie bins round this area and I make a deposit regularly!!  If you do, I think you need to bag it and seal it carefully.    We've usually lived in the country so disposal has been comparatively easy - the previous place we lived in had a convenient manhole cover which I lifted and put the pooh down there - after all I paid for water out as much as water in!!.    There are doggie pooh bins you can buy - you sink them in the ground and add lime (or whatever) to break the matter down.  You do need the space to be able to do this however.|`|AA11097657	In the UK I double bag my dogs waste and put it in the black bin for household waste.|`|Kgi2RxhBaa	I don't know about Ireland, but I always throw the litter box clumps in the dumpster with the rest of the trash. What else can you do with it?|`|3iYnokfpaa	In the UK dog waste is usually put out with general waste. It must be bagged and sealed.
K5HsBuBgaa	I saw it! The puppies were adorable! :DD|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	I have heard of it but never saw it until last night. It was hilarious. I loved it. I watched more of it than of the Super Bowl.
uZrYy6snaa	There's a couple of ways you could attach an aquarium to this unit.  If you could find an aquarium where the base of the tank fit snugly inside the rim of the aquarium, you could make a cover of fine chicken wire to go over the un-attached area.  The lip around the edge of the plastic cage base will sit on the glass rim of the aquarium, making sure that there are no spaces on that side for your rat to escape. Then use wooden struts to make a lid, one piece should go across the top of the tank, butted up against the side of the plastic base. Wrap the chicken wire around that bar then lay it flat across the still uncovered area of the tank, wrapped wooden strut facing upwards. Cut the chicken wire hanging over the edge of the tank, leaving enough length to wrap a couple of times around the wooden struts. With the first, wrapped strut held in place, pull the wire taut across the top of the tank then place another wooden strut, parallel to the first, on the underside of the wire. Roll the strut in towards the tank until the chicken wire is held taut between the two struts and the second strut lies flat against the edge of the tank. (the top of the strut will be flush with the top of the tank. This may take a few tries but after one or two, you should be able to judge where to start rolling it up easily enough.) Hammer a couple of nails, or those bent, U shape nail thingies, in place to hold the chicken wire where it is. Clip the wire diagonally into the corners of the tank, roll it back then cut the strut to the length of the tank side. Place the two side struts under the wire and roll them under until they pull the wire taut and are touching the other two struts. Nail them underneath the "over-the-top" strut and attach them to the ends of the other strut. Fold the left over chicken wire around itself a bit to secure the edges and make sure there's no sharp points that can hurt the ratty.  Then, the last thing you need to do it cut a hole in the side of the plastic tray that is big enough for your Ratty to fit through (not at the bottom or all the bedding will fall out) smooth the sides of the hole with sand paper and make sure there's a ladder or something similar for your pet to climb up to.    If you can't find an aquarium that your cage fit's snugly into/on top of, it's not so easy.  (I know my last explaination was long and a bit garbled but I hope it was easy enough to follow)  So, if you don't have the size you need, you will need to make an alternative arrangement. Try finding a piece of thick, heavy duty plastic which is bigger than the base of the cage and big enough to cover the tank with an inch extra on all 4 sides. It's best to place the cage in a corner area above the tank. If it is small enough to sit at 90 degrees to the tank below then do that (When I had a similar setup, my cage covered half of the base tank.)   Carefully drill holes through the plastic and into wooden slats. Screw the slats onto the plastic, make sure this "lid" fits securely onto the tank with as little movement as possible. Place the cage where you want it and carefully drill a line of small holes (the width of  piece of strong wire) along the longest edge, closest to the middle, then using strong, flexible wire, thread it through the holes and around the bars of the cage (as if you are sewing it to the plastic) This can then be used like a hinge so that the inside of the cage part can be easily reached for cleaning. Drill a couple of small holes at each corner, thread some of the strong wire through then twist together and form into a hook, one hook at each corner. Use the hooks to secure the cage to the plastic base/lid. If there is a third or more of the lid uncovered, cut across the lid a couple of inches from the edge of the cage. Cut right through the wooden pieces as well, so that the whole part of the lid lifts straight off. You can either drill a mesh of 1-2mm holes all over the uncaged plastic or you can cut out 4 panels leaving the panel looking a bit like a window frame, then cover those areas with fine chicken mesh and wire it firmly in place. Finally, place the lid back in place then attach a small bolt on either side to hold the wooden slats where you cut them.     So, that's how you can make it work. I know you can do it this way because I did and it worked.     Good Luck|`|z01moLIvaa	The first answer is right... You need to just get a bigger cage. That tiny cheap thing won't last long anyway since most of it is made out of plastic! Rats do love to chew.  Here's some better ideas-  http://martinscages.com/products/cages/r... (the bigger cages are more towards the bottom)  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js... (single unit would be good enough for a couple rats)  http://www.petco.com/product/106171/PETC...    Bird cages also make excellent cages for rats! Just as long as it's bigger than the cage you already have. And cover the wire flooring with wood, carpet, or cardboard (do this for any cage) to prevent injury and a disease known as bumblefoot for your rats.    Good luck :)|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	lawl just get rid of the whole cage  i'm sorry to tell you but you've wasted a hundred dollars!! yay!  you can either  A) buy a new cage thats bigger and better  or  B) just give them a play pen to roam around.    hmm maybe the cage could be useful in some areas. you can keep the rats in the cage while you sleep, but during the day you should allow your rats to run around the floor with a play pen around them    some inexpensive ideas for play pens:  those really big books for children, made out of cardboard. buy a few of those and stack them upright around in a circle or any shape you'd like.    buy a play pen from a store, they're about 20 bucks i think    make your own out of some wood and wire. i'm guessing it would cost around 20-50 dollars, who knows i'm not a carpenter.    or find an empty room to let them run in. just close the door and make sure there's nothing dangerous to chew in there.    ALWAYS SUPERVISE WHEN ALLOWING RATS TO ROAM FREELY    who knows what troubles they could get themselves into|`|pWQfp4NGaa	Okay, that whole cage looks way to small for two grown rats. Forget about adding to it, just buy a new cage. Better yet, buy an old bird aivery and modify it so your rats can utilize all the space. Build wooden ramps and wooden huts, attach thick woven ropes from the roof for them to climb. Rats just love places to roam and explore, use your imagination to build them one kick-*** rat cage!

8i90ov0Gaa	You're having a hard time finding them because you live in Illinois and it's the middle of winter. In warmer months they are so easy to find if you know where to look that a trap is unnecessary.

Good Luck.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	How much worse does it need to be?  Take him now, he's already suffering.  Don't prolong his suffering.|`|tCbN2F7iaa	well obviously its serious if you cant touch him and he wont eat. go to a vet NOW.|`|NKNJm5uSaa	It's serious.  Time to go to the vet.  Don't wait.|`|xz1Eqm47aa	could be a million different things.  he should go to the vet, sorry i know times are tough for people right now but sometimes waiting it out just lets the dog get worse and the bill get higher to treat|`|o5Y3AORqaa	This has happened to my dog too but it went away after a day so we didnt take him to the vet.    I suggest you do take him if he doesnt get better soon :/|`|YV1bOajXaa	Did you take him to the vet yet?  Vet's accept Care Credit - they will let you apply on the phone from the office in most instances.  I'm sure they run into situations like this all the time, they are not going to refuse treatment if you don't pay up front are they?|`|9UttDvcsaa	You really should take him to the vet if there is any way you can.   It sounds serious.  Take him to the vet and see if you can make payments.  At least take him and tell them that you only have x amount of dollars.  Put it on a credit card but do something.  Seriously it isn't right to let him suffer.  I usually am able to tell someone something that might help and I don't have any answers for you it sounds like he was poisoned or his body is in shock or brain damage.  Try to get him some fluids while you wait on his fate.  Rice and chicken broth and pedialyte with a syringe.  Do something to make him comfortable.  Good Luck.|`|wsaaqDLXaa	That happened to one of my dog's once. She fell off the porch and hit her head and they had to inject her with some kind of shot because her brain was swelling or something. Also, he could have broken a bone or something....I don't know. I'd take him to the vet immediately. Our dog was close to the point where they couldn't save her and we went that night.
0SHAY9TQaa	All dog owners have had this problem. You need to train your dog. Teach her right from wrong. Take her to dog training classes. Take her out on runs, to tire her out. Give her plenty of bones and toys to chew on.    This isn't Tessa's fault. It is your lack of training :)    Good Luck!|`|6AqFenaSaa	She either wants attention or she's a puppy. You could play with her or walk her to tire her out. My dog has a lot of energy, too, and in the winter time it's tough on him b/c his outdoor play time is seriously cut down. So we take an old towel or t-shirt and tie up some treats in knots to entertain him for a while. Try playing fetch with her up and down the steps to wear her out or see if you can set up something with a neighbor with a dogshe gets along with, like trade off days cause they'll play together at one house and then your house will be peaceful and vice-versa. Dog park?|`|AA10432466	every dog owner has this problem you need to train her to learn from right and wrong. I have a shitzu named Snoopy and after a couple of weeks, he was the best dog i could of ever picked!|`|gMzPpFgjaa	Umm.... how old is your dog? If she is not a year old it is not her fault because she is too young to understand or chewing on things because her puppy teeth hurt. If not, buy her stick treats and chewing toys and if you have enough money, take her to training lessons.|`|1S5AbPueaa	Ok I have a dog I get super annoyed with ,but he is not a chewer.He is a beggar and food snatcher.uugghh it kills me.Just last night he took a whole piece of wheat bread off my sons high chair,while my son was in the chair.He drives me nuts,but everyone still loves him:)|`|vVbNvzmgaa	The breed of your dog is very active and needs a lot of attention.  My boyfriend and I have been researching husky dogs because he really wants to get one, we decided we would wait until we had a place of our own because his apartment is too small.  It sounds like Tessa needs to be out doing things.  If you keep her inside then get her a big raw hide bone so you get stuff done or relax.  I bought my dog a 24in rawhide bone from petsmart.  They are really expensive but it will help with the chewing because once they get started they don't stop until it's gone or they're tired.  Try the rawhide!!!  :)|`|Q8veSKGBaa	Get her chew toys, and like rawhide chews. i give them to my dog all the time and it helps with the chewing and tearing. but you have to take the time to give the dog attentiion. I just got another dog and now they play so i dont have to do as much!
acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	While rabbits don't need vaccinations like dogs and cats do, rabbits are not low maintenance pets, health-wise. They should have yearly veterinary check-ups, and they can get sick like any companion animal, in which case, they need veterinary attention. They also need monitoring by their caretakers to make sure that they're staying healthy. And to answer you other question....Here's what to do if your bunny bites:    STEP ONE: Do NOT hit the bunny, or toss it across the room whilst screaming wild curses. The desire for this sort of reaction is understandable, but is generally frowned upon in rabbit keeping literature. Gently encourage the bunny back to its cage, where it can feel safe and can decompress. Think of it as a bunny time out, if that helps.    STEP TWO: Clean and disinfect the bite. You don't want to have any nasty infections to be weakening you next time you have to do battle with the small, fragile, and fuzzy creature.    STEP THREE: Figure out why the bite occurred. Did you scare the bunny? Did you offend the bunny? Did you hurt the bunny? Did the bunny simply decide that you needed to be taught a lesson? All these reasons are valid ones in the mind of a rabbit.    STEP FOUR: Once you have determined the reason, take steps to avoid it again. Rabbits that are in pain, or are scared will often bite, and you don't want your pet to become frightened or perpetually hostile towards you. Bunny/human relations can often break down when these incidents occur, and if you don't stop and think about things from the rabbit's perspective, then you may end up with a situation less easily resolved than the conflict in the middle east.    STEP FIVE: Make amends. Or, as our Christian friends like to say, turn the other cheek. This doesn't mean you should shove your fingers down the bunny's throat, but you should spend some time interacting with it in a positive way, once you have both had time to calm down. Keep an eye on the bunny in future, and if it shows signs of trying to bite again gently dissuade it. Bonding with your rabbit in a positive way is the best way to reduce future bites.
PAZWfnFtaa	Poor baby!  I'm glad he's recovering.
A2IDiIpIaa	The rats themselves will cost 20 dollars for both.  A good cage is 60.  A water bottle, food bowl and the first batch of bedding and food will be 30 dollars.  Toys 10 dollars.  Monthly cost is ROUGHLY 15-20 dollars.  Most rats never go to the hospital but neutering / spaying 45 tumor removal 100-150 and if you need to put them to sleep 50 dollars or so.  Hope I helped    Dad to three baby rat girls|`|mbt4topIaa	The cage is very expensive, the rats are generally low in price, and as for food, it is relatively cheap... like $20 a month or so, but that's for four rats, especially if you have a pet store card where you save some money.  water is free... the bottles are about $3, treats can range anywhere from what you are eating for dinner, to whatever the pet store charges.  As for medical bills... all depends on the rat, my 8+ are all healthy. but in the end, it is worth it, they are loving, and compassionate.|`|3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	A good rat cage can range anywhere from 60-100 and it needs to be quite large if housing two rats. Rats can cost from 5-15 depending on whether they are from show rats etc, but most pet shop rats are around 5.    As for food and equipment, these vary in price depending on what type of things that you buy. So it's best to work out a budget that you can afford per month.    As for medical bills, they may or may not occur, always expect to have to pay something as any animal can become ill without warning.    Just remember to get rats of the same sex or it will become very expensive if they start producing babies.
0SHAY9TQaa	All dogs shed, some less than others. I will give you a list of breeds recommended for people with allergies.    Hold on....I found this great website for you!  http://www.dogguide.net/dog-breeds-for-a...    It includes pics and breeds. Good Luck :)|`|F27az9NEaa	There is no such thing as a hypo-allergenic dog.    There are dogs though that have coats more like hair, or don't have fur at all.  Mexican Hairless Dog (aka Xolo)  Chinese Crested  American Hairless Terrier      (also keep in mind that your allergies shouldn't be the only factor to look at when considering getting a dog. Activity level, finances, time, & ect. are other things that need to be looked into)|`|p7swtBYzaa	Please don't believe this bad breeder nonsense - all dogs have the same thing, whether you call it hair or fur.  Double coated dogs shed more than single coated ones, that's the only difference.    There is no such thing as a hypo-allergenic dog for the simple reason that it is NOT fur/hair that causes allergies, it is dander.   Dander comes from the skin and saliva of dogs, and all dogs have skin and saliva.    You may well be allergic to some dogs and not others, this has happened with one of our kids, she is allergic to some dachshunds, not others, and it is not a matter of coat, it is more a matter of the dog's skin.   As far as we can figure, the two she has been allergic to have very oily skin - the others do not.    You will need to spend some time with a dog you may want to adopt, go to your local shelters and play with a dog you like, rub your face in it's coat and see if it triggers your allergies - that is the only way to know.  As I said, it is not even breed specific, some members of a breed can trigger allergies, while others do not - it seems to be an individual dog matter - mostly depending on skin and saliva dander.    Don't be gullible, get the facts.|`|Bw18seFqaa	all dogs have hair..  except hairless..  there is NO difference between hair and fur anyways.  http://dogplay.com/Articles/MyArticles/h...    No breed of dog is 100% hypoallergenic.. its not the hair you are allergic to, its the protiens found in the dander, urine and saliva.    Poodles and Bichons are generally the most tolerated by people with dog allergies.|`|wJRHTS7Maa	the only dogs that dont have much fur are chinese crested|`|S9B8Fr4daa	Just because a dog does not have fur--Does NOT mean it is hypo allergenic.  Dander is what causes lots of allergies to animals and even a hairless dog will have dander.    Also.  No dog is completely hypo-allergenic.  That would be impossible.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Chinese Crested     Peruvian Hairless    Or you dont have to get a hairless you should do fine with a Poodle, Bichon or maltese all 3 are considered hypoallergenic|`|dZ3B2vNIaa	The xoloitzquilinti ( pronounced sholo-its-kwil-intee) is completely bald but a fair size.

CaWJkSqbaa	ok i did this it works. Put paper towel or a old washcloth down in the spot where they usually poop and pee.Then pick it up if they peed on in and move it to where you want them to go. Then they will smell the scent and start going their.I know it's gross but it really works i have done it before.     PLZ RATE MY ANSWER THE BEST :).|`|bZjuP1Bqaa	Wouldn't you rather let them pee and poop in the yard and not in your house tho?      Why are you complaining.
GI27dKIkaa	Assuming he's just a pup - start training him early to go on newspaper.  Once he's had his injections (and cleared to go outside) start letting him out soon as he's had something to eat.    That way, he'll get conditioned to let you know when he wants to go out.  That composter is a great idea if you have the garden space.  You're not allowed to put doggy-poop in the wheelie bins, and of course flushing it down the loo is a no-no - so 're-cycling' it like that is cool !|`|5d0588fa97d047676b038c38ba3e0cd3aa	You'll be walking the dog, right?    It can pee & poo whilst on its walks. Pick up the poo in a plastic bag (nappy/diaper bags are ideal) and dispose with your normal waste.|`|I3foEBp2aa	I've heard of people using a child's small wading pool.  They fill it with soil and sod...instant "potty yard"!  Instead of sod, some people fill it with cat litter, sand, pea gravel, etc.  I like the sod idea best, as you'll have to change out the other fills on a regular basis to keep it sanitary.  Oh, and here's related thought: you could also get small sections of trellis or picket fence to provide a screen around the pool to help make the whole thing more attractive looking.
igGDiiczaa	Let them know that you are definitely responsible enough to handle the responsibility of owning a pet. Be ready to demonstrate that by volunteering to be tested. Have your parents give you something to take care of for a set amount of time. It can be an egg with a mark on it (don't let it break!) a sack of flour, a plant, a virtual pet (a virtual pet meaning the dogs on the Petz 5 games or a pet on Webkinz) or even a friend's pet. Doing well on this test run may help show your parents that you're responsible and serious about wanting a cat.   Do chores around the house to prove you are responsible. Offer to help with the extra housecleaning and vacuuming. cats can be messy, especially before they're housebroken. Most dogs will shed. Since it is you who wants a cat, you should make the extra effort. You should explain to your parents that you are willing to do this before the cat gets there to prove your sincerity.   Do your homework! Find local shelters, see about their shots and if they come with a leash and collar, research training techniques, etc. This will make your parents believe that you really are serious   Make a presentation, and show it to your parents. Make sure to include a list of the things that you will do so that the dog gets taken care of, supplies the cat will need, average prices the supplies will cost, and maybe even find a cat that matches the breed that you want at a local breeder or animal shelter.   List the benefits of having a cat     pets can be therapeutic, especially during sad or lonely times. A cat is a friend that will always be there to cheer you up!     Learn how to house-train a cat so that it will not poop in the house. Books on the subject can be found and borrowed free from your local library. Learn as much as you can about dogs, not just about basic care. Read books about breeds, cat-related sports, common diseases, cute tricks, nutrition, etc. This will show that you are willing go the extra mile for your future cat.   Take a friend or relative's cat for a weekend as a "test run" to show your parents that you are ready for the responsibility.   Offer to help pay for the cat food by doing extra chores or contributing some of your pocket money.   To prove that you are responsible enough, show that you can take care of yourself. Eat healthy, shower often, brush your teeth, and do your own laundry. I have found these work very well.   Give them time to think about it. Pestering them will only undo your earlier work showing them that you are mature and responsible.   If your parents eventually let you have a cat, follow through on your promises. You can even sign a contract with them before you get your cat listing your new responsibilities.   You should talk first to the person you most trust(mom or dad or boyfriend) and get them to talk to the other parent   When you decide you want a kitten, get a mom or dad not a grandparent, because the grandparent is not the one who will have a new cat in the house, YOU and YOUR parents will. Ease into talking them into it.    Convince your parents that you are saving a life by adopting a shelter dog. You are saving a pet that will have been killed next week. Think about it.   Let everyone 'think' about it a few days, and then try visiting a local shelter.|`|10eguzBCaa	dont think she wants an other animal but keep working on it u never know good luck xx|`|eMUbdnG1aa	just say if you don't that it will probably die. =/|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, how about volunteer at the animal shelter.  There are so many ways you can show your mom you are growing up.  I understand your mom, it will not be fair to leave the cat at home alone, when you guys travel.|`|sGv3RebZaa	Hmmm....tough question. It sounds like you're doing everything to show your mom that you can be trusted to take care of a pet.    Two concerns that I can see are the fact that your current cat is so much older than the kitten and the fact you travel so much.    I don't know that there's much you can do to convince your mom other than to explain why you would really like the kitten.    Make sure you can answer any possible question she may ask (traveling arrangments, feeding, cleaning, vet, etc.) The best way to bring your point across is to build up a good argument and present it in a way that presents the best reflection on you. (ie, throwing a temper tanturm and saying you really really want the kitten wouldn't be a plus on your argument)    Good luck.|`|bmCDuR7Gaa	i know your problem when i was 11 i wanted a kitten ( im now 13 too)  i got 2 in the end they where brother and sister   make your parents feel guilty ,show them photos of the kitten take them to see it   prepare for the kitten talk about what your going to call it where its going to sleep etc   buy toys for it i bought a cat carrier and was brought down to the re homing center the same day   act excited about it   say it will die if you don't get it   be good and suck up to your mother   get your dad to talk to your mother about it     hope this helped|`|WEymqF7Daa	Give her reasons for why you want the kitten. You need to show her why it is important to you.|`|roeLOJndaa	If you travel a lot, getting a second cat would be a great idea because I'm sure the one you have now gets lonely. We used to have only one cat and she was always so lethargic and seemed very unhappy until we got a second. Now that she has a kitty friend she seems much happier. You should tell your mom this.    Also, you could tell her that if the family can't handle the new kitten after a few weeks, it's okay to bring her back. By that time she will have fallen in love with her, I'm sure.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Parents rule. There is a good reason why your mom doesn't want another cat. If Mom says "no, not now," let it be. We can't always have everything we want when we want it.
3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	Don't buy a wormer from a petshop or supermarket as they aren't strong enough to be of much use. The best ones for the job are the ones you get from the vet.

45e02f98828bf1f1f04987f503111641aa	Sounds to me like she is in heat. Female cats meow almost nonstop to call for a mate and signal their readiness to breed. They will rub, crawl and roll around on everything they can get on.  Have you had her fixed. If not now would be a great time to do so. If you have other cats in the house that are not fixed or if she goes outside you will most likely end up with a litter of kittens. If she is the only cat and indoors only she will just drive you nuts. Cats go into heat often. Is is also unhealthy for a cat to go into heat so often. It can cause cysts on her ovaries and other health issues. Good luck...|`|Uy79dKEmaa	She is in heat.  Please get her spayed as soon as possible.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	your cat IS in heat.  You need to get her spayed and she will stop doing those things!    My cat used to do the same thing, got her spayed, problem solved!|`|uurgL3oZaa	She might be in heat.|`|hOGWbUAhaa	Have you seen her go to the bathroom at all.  She could be constipated.  She could just be sick too, if you were really sick, you might be moaning too.
YXywKp6Caa	Every time you see a little kid and you have your dog with you tell your dog to sit. If she won't sit push on her behind and give her the command at the same time. If your dog jumps up and knocks the little kid down pull her away and walk her in a small circle. She'll soon learn that if she jumps she ends up walking in circles. Dogs hate walking in circles.|`|vRG0ebayaa	Still keep the leash on her, but when she does jump up pull her back (not to harshly) and say 'no' then give her no attention what so ever. Keep doing this and maybe she will find out that if she is too excited about new kids coming along, she won't have the privileges of actually meeting them.    Good Luck|`|rDLTnjRyaa	Try teaching her how she can get petted. This is really simple. First of all, when you are getting ready to introduce her to somebody, tell them that you are in the process of teaching her not to jump. Ask the person to help. As soon as your dog jumps, have the person turn their back towards her and ignore her until she stops. If the person does this several times, your dog will eventually learn to sit and be nice. Once she is being good, the person can then turn around, tell her she is a good girl, and pet her. Don't forget that the leash has more than one purpose. You can use it to make her get off of a person. The other thing you should consider is getting a different collar for her. Don't get the choke collar since those don't really work. A pinch collar would be more helpful. It doesn't make the dog uncomfortable and it isn't inhumane, barbaric, or cruel. My dog has one on, and he is fine with it. I find it easier to walk him and teach him to heel. It doesn't have sharp points on it to hurt the dog. All it does is pinch the dog when you correct it. The other way to look at it is this: the collar is a tool to assist you in training your dog.|`|H66GqwO0aa	Check out Cesar - he's got all the answers about training!    http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/
fCSynjWjaa	That is tricky - they are very bright and energetic dogs. You did a good thing but it might be that you can't manage. If so, don't beat yourself up. At least you tried. Now for the positive advice.    Spraying easily solved - losing the knackers is the only option, I'm afraid. You shouldn't have to pay with the vet charities eg pdsa.    Longest morning and evening walks you can manage.    Kongs are expensive but good. My dogs like plastic bottles with a treat inside just as much.     Bones from a friendly and inexpensive butcher to leave behind in the day?    Visits from a person who likes walks but can't keep a dog? Day care from someone retired? You might be lucky to find someone else like you. Maybe advertise on the local internet sites. Local paper might even run it as a feel good story.    Good luck!|`|6AqFenaSaa	My dog is very active too and we both work 8-5 at my house as well. He sleeps all day and then when I get home tired he just wants to play for hours. Here's some ideas that work with him:    playing fetch up and down the stairs  tying up treats in an old shirt for him to tear apart and find (takes a while)  dog park  frisbee  hide and seek (lol)  car rides on errands like to the supermarket - they get tired hanging their head out the window and sniffing everything  hiding toys  switching out his toys every now and then so they seem new and keep his interest  taking turns with a friend with dogs so one day we have both and then next we have a quiet house    Good luck - hope something on here fits what you're looking for!|`|igOAlZ3saa	try to take him out for a walk 2 times a day doesn't have to be a long walk just to get him to explore. or get the dog toys that the dog has to work for the treats. wut i did was get a cat i no that sounds mean but they get along good. my dog would chase the cat around (make shore its a boy cat). and in the winter they keep each other warm.|`|F27az9NEaa	Well my first set of advice would be to get him fixed.  That's just common sense.    But yes, do walk with him and perhaps change it up, go bike jouring, or hiking.  While you are away, perhaps hide a few treats for him to find. Collies are an active breed and are very intelligent. Not only will you need to stimulate his body, but his mind as well. Perhaps get a few kong balls and feeder balls for him to chew while away.

1385be59713e6fd1ff6db660046deb7faa	Dark Urine is never a good sign, it is in indicator that something may be wrong. This can be from dehydration or it can be an indication of blood in the urine, it may be caused by something simple such as a bladder infection or a sign of something much more serious such as Kidney-nephritis, trauma etc.  Bottom line is, this is one of those times that you need to seek medical attention for your pet as quickly as possible.

0SHAY9TQaa	I own a Golden (8 months!) You need to take your dog to training classes. No, that is not normal. You must train your Golden :)    Good Luck!|`|9W9l8HAuaa	he's probably nervous  he needs to get used to walking and rules(like not going to the bathroom in his crate)  try little walks that aren't around other dogs  and when he does a no-no, it will be hard but tell him no and mabe put his nose in it or he will never learn and be stubborn|`|s0XR8cxLaa	umm train it   der|`|24CFl7sjaa	Yes its normal, a dog wont walk to heel unless it has been taught to. Start puppy classes and learn how to train your dog before he gets too big to handle and starts dragging you down the street.  If he is soiling his crate it may be too big for him or he is being left in it too long. A young dog is like a baby and needs to eliminate frequently, you may need to let him out late at night and once again during the night. Time his feeds so you give him time to allow the last feed through his system before he is put to bed. Remove his water at least an hour before you crate him and allow him to relieve himself before he is settled for the night. If he cries to get out in the night, let him out or he will soil his crate and you make your housebreaking job so much harder. It doesnt take long before they are mature enough to make it through the night.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	He's a 12 week old baby.  Leash walking is not something his mama would have taught him.  It's something you must teach him. He has no idea what a leash is.  What you do is, assuming for a minute he's already accustomed to his buckle collar, attach the leash to the collar and, when he's supervised, let him drag it around the house. Be careful it doesn't get caught on things.  Once he's basically ignoring the leash, pick up the end and just follow where he goes at first.  When he's used to the feel of you at the end of the lead, then start gently, using praise, toys, treats (whatever motivates him) getting him to go where you want to go. In additon sometimes just tether him to you and go about your business around the house. basically ignoring the pup.  This way he has to follow where you go, which builds the bond between you and helps establish you as his leader.      As far as peeing and pooping in the crate: (1) Thoroughly clean up with an enzyme cleaner to destroy the odor at the molecular level. (2) Make sure everything's on a strict schedule. (3) No food or Water (pick the water up and the food should NOT be free fed) after 8pm (or two hours before bed). (4)  Set your alarm about half way through the night and take him out to go potty (yep, it's just like having a baby.  That's what he is!).  (5) Adjust that night-time outing according to whether or not he's already had an accident (adjust time back in 15 minute increments). (6) Gradually adjust time forward in 15 minute increments until he's able to make it through the night. If you go too fast and he has an accident, just go back a step or two.    You can't expect him to have control over those muscles for at least another two months.  Be patient and consistent and he'll get there.|`|VWybtG9Kaa	Thats completley normal! duh. so you should TRAIN her...     Go get some golden retriver info books, use firm words to train her, don't hit, and you'll be fine. I'm sure you'll find some info out there.|`|B0hTxUnCaa	if he doesn't walk on the leash get down to his Level with a treat as he comes closer give him little bits of treat as he gets better start giving less treats  as for the pooping if you catch him in the act pick him straight up and put him were he knows is ok to poop he will get the hang of it!!!|`|xTAR26Gkaa	he just needs to get used to walking on leash, keep working with him on it. how big is his crate? if it's too big he'll still go to the bathroom in it. also, how long are you keeping him in there. puppies can't hold their pee and poop in too long, they need to go out every 1-2 hours!|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Yes..you need to train him..his crate is too big if he can go potty in it.
0SHAY9TQaa	Yes. You really shouldn't give too much to her though. I give them to my Golden when we train. They are low on calories--which is good for her :)    Good Luck!|`|okH04Nhlaa	Yes as long as she doesn't eat them in large amounts.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	They`re not a proper balanced dog food, but ok for the occasional treat, I guess.|`|VWybtG9Kaa	I wouldn't risk it|`|FewhKlx9aa	As a treat or reward they are fine|`|LSuu1cCkaa	As far as know any kind of artificial sweet is not good for dog.

All Natural and made in USA so no lead or other crap from China.|`|F27az9NEaa	I just spent 52$ on a 33lb of Solid Gold, but I put no price on my dog's health.|`|APNzM50Saa	Go to your local market that sells dog food and look at the tags. There should be a box or some number that says $2.09 or something per pound. The lower the number, the better the price. Compare what you think is "high quality". To tell you the truth, my uncle used to work for a tucking company and was delivering some dog food, and saw many different "high" and "low" quality foods being made with the same ingredients.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Actually Purina ONE can't really be considered junk.  But less expensive and not all that bad is "Black Gold"  http://www.blackgolddogfood.com/cornfree...|`|a29qiNkvaa	Ok well I feed solid gold barking at the moon its grain free and it was about $60.00 for a 33lb bag! I have 2 dogs that are 95lb each and I feed 2 cups of food a day! My last bags I bought 16th of Jan and I still have half a bag left! So I think a bag will last about 4 or 5 weeks!     I have also feed EVO and it was about the same about 4 weeks for a 28lb bags that costs about $70.00    SO the solid gold is a better deal!     There is also Taste of the wild! It looks like its about $45.00 for a 30lb bag! I cant feed this because one of my dogs has an allergy to chicken. I have been reading that you feed about the same as the solid gold and EVO! So that would be my first choice if I could feed it! I would say this is the best bang for you buck!!     Good luck! I hope this helps you!!!|`|vFCQcRNEaa	I think Solid Gold is pretty well priced, or Innova Evo.|`|gqf1WT0Faa	well there are some great dog foods at Petco. i like the organix and avoderm, both really good foods, but be sure to look at your pets individual health needs. not just brand names.|`|VWybtG9Kaa	Hi,     We took our dogs off supermarket/pet shop dog food some time ago.   Most of it, (the cheap stuff is worse) is made from diseased cut-offs of animals which can kill a dog. Its happened quite a lot.   Also, some of the food that comes from china, is dog/cat meat, which also goes in to the tins and bags of comercial dog dinner.   There are some foods you can buy, such as butcher pet food mince/ which is only about $1 a few meals. Ask your local butcher.     We also give our two labs brown rice, dinner left overs *(providing they are not bad for the dog), bits of bread, etc. We then soak it in cheap veggy stock or beef/chicken stock, and thats the meal for the day.     Reasonably priced, good for your dog.     I hope this helps.|`|B0hTxUnCaa	the one that i use is pro plan and they have dog food for al sorts of dogs sensitive stomach young old Senior you can get it at a Target|`|9AHTNcanaa	It depends...what is "reasonablely" price in your opinion.      According to many of the vets and trainers I have talked to, the best dog foods should not contain corn, wheat, and (if you can) beef.  These are the most common ingredients to cause allergies.  They are also just fillers and don't really provide too much benefit for your dog.  My family uses Nutro Lamb and Rice (http://www.nutroproducts.com/ncdry-lr.sh... but there are many other great brands out there:    -Avoderm --- http://www.breeders-choice.com/avoderm.h...    - California Natural...I think this one is pricey though :-(    -  Innova -- innvoapet.com    - Wysong  (I met a lady that swore by this brand!)  -- Wysong.net    The key is just to make yourself read labels...          If you still need help my friend at a Dog's Life is super knowledgeable and would probably be happy to help you out.  (http://www.adogslifestore.com/)      You can also talk to your vet.  I know mine will even help me find the best store to buy it at!  :-)      Hope this helped!  Best of Luck!!    ~Samantha|`|26PPwzrWaa	For a price comparison of high quality foods vs grocery brand vs popular brand here is a good webpage that breaks it all down:   http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...    Canidae used to be the best price for quality, but since their ingredient downgrade and price hike they are no longer contender in my opinion for that spot. I feel Taste of the wild has some good deals for grain free options.   I think TOTW was listed at 40 for 30lbs which beats evo at 60 for 28lbs(grain free) and orijen in all likelyhood(check out price because I dont know it, no one nearby sells it).   Only problem with TOTW is it is harder to find. Typically found at feed stores. I have never seen it at a boutique or petstore though.     Chicken soup for the dog lovers soul is good and was before canidae changed, the second contender for best price for lb.     Instinct has some good options for a rotation diet. Dont know price though.     The home page for dog food project has a little info on the canidae change. They are currently going through a lawsuit about it.     A few pet store options:   Solid gold Barking At The Moon(light blue shiny bag), Mmelinia(dark blue shiny bag), Hund-n-Flocken(lamb based, not meant to be permanent food due to lamb base). typically found at petco  Blue: Buffalo and wilderness can sometimes be found at petsmart.  Castor and pollux: not the greatest, but no where near the worst you could find in a petstore.   Dick van pattens formulas  Wellness/Wellness core are at my local petco, check out wellness, although the formulas are well known to be rich. Core is just their grain free line.     If loose stool results, lower amount you are feeding by 1/4 to 1/2 cup.|`|nhIKLYs0aa	I also use Innova Evo. It may seem like it cost more. But, with less fillers in the food, you will feed the dog less food. So don't just go by price alone. Look at the what the contents are as well.|`|Wvb08bniaa	Dog food nutrition directly influences every aspect of your dog's life.

NUIrBHXgaa	Tubes Lots of tubes.  Lol i have 2 gerbils too. Ive go 3 separate cages for them all hooked up by tubes. One big fish tank 10 gallon. a fairly plane wire cage and some kind of plastic cage with and undercage a wheel and a lookout tower.  anyway they stay entertained as long as i rearrange the tubes every time i clean the cage. They also love to chew. I got Them one of those Snack Shack things. They chewed the roof off in 5 hours. The glass tank i fill with fluff about 1/4 the way cause they like to dig and make tunnels in it. I also keep there food, water in separate cages so that they have more reason to travel. Oh and in the wire cage i have a big sort of chew log. I set it up straight and sometimes they jump on it and look around. Hope that helps some.|`|s0XR8cxLaa	buy more stuff that could be fun for them  buy them one of those balls u can put him in  so they can roll around the place|`|fpHblEtAaa	thats cute! But you should make it more fun like add chewing blocks, tunnels maybe a little house stuff like that! You should make their habitats more challenging for them to ex-cerise  and play with! ;D  Maybe you should build a mini playground and use your imagination!  Also you should play with them yourself when you have the time! Hope this helps! ;)|`|7AI58IS8aa	What I do is that I use left over boxes, like from kleenex, or food cartons, and stuff like that. I cut them up, and make a maze for my hamster to run in.
H06PtiIAaa	long and wide is important    you can go with a 180 gallon with a sump of at least 55 gallons.
pDKm9Wmgaa	Is this a new development? If so, you need to get the cat in to the vet.  This could be diabetes. The blood sugar is spilling into the urine. It is not normal to smell like syrup.|`|fTpk7ospaa	no for instance my cat smells like engine oil|`|sOkePjK3aa	My cat comes home sometimes smelling like syrup. I don't know why. It's weird though.|`|c4f8a63972685e95e511d29969f672a3aa	No|`|sGWVQcQmaa	my cat does sometimes too.  its weird.
92cx9g8jaa	Get a snake! Snakes are so cool. But if you aren't a snake person get a bunny or a chinchilla. They're fuzzy and cute but make sure they are kept in cool temperatures or they will die.|`|rlvrgwWvaa	Rabbits are awesome. They can stay in their cage while you're at work, and the only noise they make is from the rattling of their cages. They're very interesting, and affectionate. And they're most active on a good work schedule, morning and evening. Probably when you'll have the most time for them. They're relatively inexpensive and easy to care for. And there are plenty of rabbits in shelters that need homes. If you're not allergic to cats, then rabbits should be fine. Plus they live about as long as a dog, depending on size. They're really great pets and I love them. But research up on them before you get one.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	You could get a bird, like a pair of lovebirds or a parakeet.      If you aren't sqeemish you could get reptiles like leopard geckos, corn snakes, tortoises, or bearded dragons.  I have several reptiles in my apartment.     If you want something furry, try a chinchilla.  They are very cuddly and fun to watch.|`|AA11285960	bunny?
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	The most common reason for a ferret to have blood in his stool is from a stomach infection/ulcers.  They will need to go to the vet (any time blood is present means the animal MUST SEE A VET).  My oldest girl had the classic 'black,tarry stool' which is digested blood.  She was suffering from a heliobacter infection which caused ulcers to form.  She was put on amoxicillin, metronidazole, sucralfate, famotidine and a bland, soft diet.    This can kill your ferret if the ulcers reach an artery (they bleed out).  Other reasons for blood in stool include: tearing of the rectum/gastrointestinal tract, foreign body scraping intestinal/rectal lining, and of course various other illnesses can cause blood to show in stool/urine.  All these need treatment or palliative measures administered by vets.  Good luck and hope your little guy gets better!|`|AA10539102	my ferret used to eat wierd things like crayons, that turned it strange colors.... but take him to the vet to be sure.... ferrets are prone to cancers, so maybe ferrets can get colon cancer like people.....but at such a young age, it's likely that he ate something that maybe got stuck somewhere... i donno.... hope it all turns out ok....|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	separate them, one of them is gang r*&^ing the other one|`|Y4pfVX10aa	i would call your vet|`|EQydFhzmaa	First, take your ferret to the vet right away, and take the other one there as well to be checked out! I would also separate your two ferrets and watch the other one for signs of illness as well. I would also clean the cages. Then, I would stick your brother's friend with the vet bill. He gave you an ill ferret and your sick ferret is his fault.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	The black part would be blood in the stool. Blood rarely shows up red if excreted in the feces.      The most common cause is ulcers, which are easily treatable with cheap daily meds. A simple stool test can determine whether ulcers are the case.      I had a male ferret with ulcers, and I think the exam was $20, and the oral meds were $20 every 3 months (sucralfate). Oh, and a 1 month antibiotic treatment which was $15 or so.    As for strings around the poop- it could potentially be parasites, or just mucus from the gut that got a bit of fresh blood on it.    The sooner you get it treated, the better, and they can live long happy lives with the ulcer meds.      Some ferrets only need the ulcer meds for a short time, while others need to be on it for life.|`|TkxWfKjsaa	take him to a vet- my ferret once ate something bad and it got him really sick with blood in his stool. we took him to the vet and they gave him medicine :}|`|eow9mxEeaa	first take him to veterinary, i think he need vaccines don't neglect this thing, it is dangerous to his life, he should be under treatment as soon as possible
VXcp8hvHaa	I just love questions like this!|`|gwyMH4NSaa	He's probably just a little excited. After all, he's only a puppy. Be patient and train him gradually.|`|O545aSKWaa	He's being a typical puppy.     The best thing for you to do is to take him out on a leash. Don't play with him or anything, just stand in one spot and see if he goes. Don't wait anymore than 5-10mins. Do this every couple of hours. If he potties, then give him a lot of praise and use a phrase like "Go Potty" this will help him learn that you want him to go outside.     If he doesn't go outside, you have two choices. Either keep him on leash with you at all times so that if he does begin to go potty you can immediately take him outside. Or you can kennel him until you're ready to take him out.    The whole point is not to let him out of your sight! If you can not catch him messing up, then you can not correct him. He won't understand that concept.    Don't bother scolding him. Like I said if you can't catch him doing wrong then you really can't correct him. If you do scold him all he'll learn is to hide what he does!
2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	Just go with the flow.  Things have a way of working out for the best.  Just relax and be thankful that you have a horse to show, no matter which one it is, and enjoy the experience.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	On one hand you are upset because you planned to show both horses, but on the other you act as though it would be a tragedy if you get stuck with the Arab.  I also don't understand the lease you mention....were you going to be leasing the two horses, or has he allowed you to ride out of friendship?  If this has just been out of friendship, I would think showing up with a lease might not go over well.  I tend to think you might regret letting your feelings be known on this.  He could interpret it as you being unappreciative, which could lead to the whole thing falling apart.  While I understand your feeling that you should have first choice, I also believe that he doesn't have to let you ride the horse at all, so he may think you are acting selfish for thinking that way.  I would give it some thought.  You know him, and can probably predict how he might react if you express all of this to him.  Would it really be such a tragedy if you rode the Arab?|`|qI6oPzA0aa	i think that you should have 1st pick on which one to use since it was your project and it sounds like you have been working with the QH more than the Arabian. so i think that you should tell the guy that & hope for the best;-) hope it works out ok, however it turns out be glad that you at least get to use a horse right, and either way you should have fun at the show. well good luck:o)|`|LE6Vot7Kaa	Since you have been working with the horses I do agree that you should have first pick. However if  you do get the Arab just remember that it's only one show. Don't stress too much and just do your best on which ever horse you get. Shows are supposed to be fun so relax!|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	While I kind of agree with you that you should have first pick, I also think you are very lucky to be able to continue any relationship with either of these horses at all.  You're lucky the owner still lets you, and you're lucky your mom still lets you since they are broken up and that usually leads to bitter feelings at least one way.  I'm surprised your riding didn't just become a victim of the breakup.    So, I think it's a bit selfish of you to think you could keep both horses for yourself.  Do you have any reason to think they wouldn't honor your request that she show the Arabian?  I don't think you should bring a lease with you but it would probably be a good idea to talk to him about coming up with a lease document.  You don't want to be too pushy or he might just say forget it.    Who knows, you might end up liking the other girl and enjoy having someone else to ride with.  Go into it with an open mind and see what happens.|`|RloOJ43haa	Since apparently they are his horses, he doesn't HAVE to let you show any of them at all. It sounds like he is being pretty generous to still let you work with any of the horses.     Taking a lease out is probably a very good idea to clarify everyone's position and expectations for the future.
e9gXZsKxaa	Separate them immediately, the fins will grow back. The better the water quality, the faster then fins regenerate.|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	ughhh  take em apart.    put the male back in his tank and the female back in hers.  Add Aquarium Salt as this will aid with the growing back of there fins and also some Stress Coat will do good.    Both of these can be purchased cheaply at the petstore.    Hope I helped.
w1lh1INHaa	Emetophobia?    Ginger is great for calming a queasy tummy.  You can usually get crystallized ginger in the produce aisle inexpensively, or in the spice aisle a little more expensively.  In a pinch, a really good ginger ale as the carbonation is often soothing and the sugar (carbohydrates) in the soda help settle stomachs.    Try charcoal capsules or tabs; your pharmicist will be able to point you to a good one.  In a pinch, you can burn some toast and nibble on the burned sections (this is also charcoal).    While you're at the drug store, get some Emetrol, which is a carbohydrate-based syrup to stop vomiting and calm a queasy stomach -- I swear by it.    Applesauce can be helpful -- freshly made, but usually not canned.  Surprisingly, apple cider vinegar diluted in water with a little baking soda can do wonders also.    Check out some of the websites and support forums for emetophobia.  I'm not saying that you have it, but you can get a lot of help and information regarding vomiting and controlling/soothing it.  Just be careful of any Quack remedies, as there are a bunch of them.    Good luck.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Try breathing slowly, smiling a toothy smile (to supress the gag reflex) and applying a cool rag/compress to your cheeks, forehead and throat.  Works for me.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Find out WHY you're vomiting, and prevent it. That's the best way.    Ginger ale & crackers are suppose to help for nausea, too.    P.S. Why is this under ''Cats''?|`|A1vdJ0huaa	?
8Y4LUH3zaa	Honestly i have own several Mares and several Geldings and i dont see any difference with them. Its a stereotype that mares are more moody. I think it depends on the rider, and the riders attitude. I show mares and they are fine in the ring. Just go in confident and with a positive attitude and you will be fine.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	I show with a mare. She does just fine --- we place high at every show. The only downfall is, yes, she does come into heat at EVERY show. And, yes, she gets excited but we do win...and that's the point...right? :]|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Mares CAN be a little more temperamental (which is why you see all of those "calming" drugs made specifically for mares at the tack stores) and high strung than geldings in new situations (ie shows) but they are not all like that. She is going to be the most moody during her heat cycle. Figure out when that is and try to avoid showing her during that time. Or, she may be perfectly fine and act like a gelding. It all depends on her personality. I own a mare who is calmer than all of my geldings combined, even when she is heat. I own another mare who literally scales the walls when she's feeling angry.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Not that I went out looking for mares or anything, but my main competition horses (mostly eventing) over the course of 20 years have been three mares (I've also ridden and shown geldings):     The first was a 14.2h QH I got when I was 11 and she was an 8 year old who had only been ridden 2 months.  She had plenty of issues, but I don't think any were directly related to her being a mare or being in competitions.  I went on to use her for Pony Club through B, and eventing through training level.    The second one was a TB/Percheron who I got as a 3 year old and did Pony Club through A, pony club nationals in show jumping, and eventing through training level.  She was never any trouble at all at competitions.    The third is a Hungarian mare that I evented with through training level but have not actively competed the last 7 years since my son was born.  I still take her places and go X-C schooling and things like that.  She also has been no trouble at shows.    I don't think a mare would ever be distracted because another horse is a gelding.  I also think that if you can get a mare to want to work for you, that she'll try harder for you than most geldings will.  The trick is getting that bond with her in the first place.    Edit:  I agree that saying mares are moody and are problematic when in heat are cop-outs for good, confident riding.  I think sometimes people make excuses for their horse's behavior, conveniently blaming it on her being a mare.  I have not had those problems with my 3 mares, probably because I don't look for reasons to let them get away with bad behavior.  That said, there are probably a few mares out there who are affected by their hormones, but I don't think it's the majority.|`|8cikAYp3aa	welcome to horse myth   409.  Mares are distracted by geldings     Mares are no different then geldings to ride or work with.  Even in season the only difference is you have to groom them a bit more.. and some may "squat and squirt"  ie show they are in season by urinating so the males can get the smell.    I had one mare who was horrible about it, but she did well in competition and when I rode in the company of stallions I put a red ribbon in her tail so everyone would stay back, and I made sure the stallion owner knew.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	It's a rare case when a mare totally loses it at a horse show.  There are mares that get more sensitive, or crabby during their cycle, but it's usually not enough to effect performance except in rare instances.    My gelding is WAY more distractable at a horse show than my mare was.  She went to a show a couple times a month through the spring and summer for several years and we could never even tell she went into heat until she was 16 years old and ended up stabled accross the aisle from the farm's breeding stallion...|`|Gc94X8Cjaa	I have to agree with everyone else, mares are fine for competition.  They don't do anything geldings don't do, and they do seem to be a little better when they know you.  But consider that they are intact, and have that edge over geldings.     I also agree that the mare's actions have more to do with the handler than with any hormones.  If you expect a horse to ct a certain way, often it does just that.  So if the owner says the mare you like is great at shows, then expect that behaviour, and I'll bet you get it!    Also, most mares get distracted with STALLIONS, who usually engage in the distraction.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	I compete in the Paint breed circuit with my mare. I have NO idea when she is in heat - she never reacts around the other horses, even in crowded enviroments. She is no more reactive than my geldings in a group.  Some mares are more prone to bad behaviors when in heat.  So this is a totally variable thing. I would ask the previous owner how the mare acts during heat. If you can trust their answer, then that will help you.  Also, be aware that you can do things to improve a mare's attitude during heat, and you can use products to stop them from coming into heat at certain times. These products aren't ideal, but they can be useful for mares that require them.|`|rsp33Aysaa	Mares are not distracted by geldings, any more than geldings are distracted by mares.  If anything, TB mares are distracted by Everything!  TB mares are stereotypically the hottest horse, but you just need to make sure you understand how she thinks before taking her to a show.    Do it!!!  I've owned an OTTB mare for over 4 years, show her every year, and she is a complete blast.  I love her so much, that I recently bought another TB mare straight off the track to train into showing.    They are just like any other horse: you have to have the bond with them, and they will try their entire heart out for you.  I love thoroughbreds So much; they have the most amazing work ethic, Incredible personalities, and will love you just as much as you love them.  Seriously.  But they are also incredibly sensitive.    You've just got to be ready for her to freak out at anything and everything.  TBs spook a Lot.  A lot.  [Well depending on the horse...]  It just depends on whether it bothers you or not.  My mare has been terrified of the dressage fence, dressage letters, the judge's stand, the judge's truck, the bell/whistles [even after four years]; even at the farm, she spooks at plastic chairs, idle trucks, and absolutely nothing [one time it took me 10 minutes to get her to calm down enough to get through the gate to the pasture, which she has been through a million times].  But once you know her well enough, she'll feed off your confidence and try her heart out for you.|`|5TCewPYRaa	There are a few down falls to having a mare for a competition horse:    1. They are prone to being stubborn and moody  2. When they are in heat it is IMPOSSIBLE to get them to co-operate with you  3. If there is a stud at the show, your mare is more likely to be concentrating on him than you.      Geldings are much more reliable mounts--especially for something like dressage which requires a lot of attention from the horse to your cues...    Needless to say, I have had 2 mare barrel racers in a row--but barrel racing is different than performance classes like pleasure, trail, showmanship, dressage etc....      Good Luck!  BB
0LwtaKxgaa	i gurantee he will be ok. Dogs get into those sorts of things but they end up coming outta there poop. No need to worry. Human pills will most likely not effect a dog. Just incase ask ur vet and get her or his opinion better then asking us because they definetly know better but if i were u i would not worry. Just look for symptoms is he is throwing up or having direhea then it must hav effected him, if not and he is acting like normal how he rlly does then he should just be fine. Jus look at how he acts and call ur vet for there opinion!|`|NGGPc6YVaa	The dog should be fine. My pit bull ate one of my pills and later that day he throw it back up but was fine.|`|9UttDvcsaa	Actually you can give Mucinex-D to dogs as a cough suppressant but it is recommended that you give them 100mg like what is in robitussin. 1 pill is 600mg of the active ingredient when using mucinex....it CAN cause an increased heart rate and lower blood pressure.  You will need to call the vet or closely monitor your dog.  If it is a bigger dog it will be less noticeable.  With a small toy type dog I would take it to the vet.  You can give the dog a 3% solution of peroxide, 1 tsp per lb of body weight to make him vomit it up.  Good Luck!|`|0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	Mucinex is guaifenesin and dextromethorpham.  Guaifenesin is used in dogs and is called cough tabs so depending on the size of the dog it may be ok.  The dextromethorpham can be deadly in dogs it may cause respiratory problems.  I don't know what your dog weighs but the usual dose is .25mg per pound and the Mucines D has 20mg of that drug in each tablet so unless you have an 80 pound dog your best and safest thing to do is call poison control or your local emergency vet so they can give you advise on whether you should make your dog vomit or if you should take it in to see them tonight.|`|X4FaXf1laa	You should call or go to the vet as soon as possible...  I don't know what will happen to the dog but that's   why you should call or go to the vet.|`|HRI8BhS6aa	call the ER vet office.... tell them the drug name "Guaifenesin" AND Sudafed , tell them when puppy ate the pill and   ..... and ask for them to look it up.....     its important because sudafed (pseudaphedrine) makes heart rate increase in humans, raises blood pressure and it is of UTMOST importance that these things don't happen to your dog....|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Call vet to get a professional opinion.

I wouldn't have thought it will do him any harm, as long as it was just the one but you MUST check and if necessary get him professional help.    Having researched a little more Guaifenesin (the generic name for Mucinex) is in more than one medication for dogs. The main question is of dosage, so get on the phone..NOW!|`|UJUEn2GZaa	take him to a doctor|`|Y4pfVX10aa	you shopuld call the vet right away|`|xz1Eqm47aa	check with the vet or poison control. and making them drink hydrogen peroxide will make a dog vomit.|`|sOkePjK3aa	I don't know because it probably has a different effect on dogs than it does on people.

I feel bad for you, that has to be really scary, not knowing if your dog's gonna be okay or not. {:(|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Being as some Mucinex requires a prescription, you should definitely take your dog to the vet. Human meds don't necessarily affect animals the same way; usually it is worse.
PrZHEy6taa	Its like you will be starting from scratch again. I have a fairly new puppy who had a serious issue with being locked up at night. We don't use a crate but the front bathroom with a baby gate instead. This way he can see whats going on in the living room and has more room for toys. It took about a week but he now knows when its bedtime he must go in the bathroom and lay down. He wakes us up at 7am on the dot every morning for breakfast and to go outside now.     Since your sister gave in to him he expects the attention now. All you can do is ignore it. If you ignore it completely by not yelling, looking at him or doing anything that makes it obvious you can hear him, he should stop doing this within a couple days.     Since my pup can not be trusted to roam the house yet i will also put his leash on him while the other end is around the couch leg if i am busy doing something. This way he has a few feet of roaming area to play but he is not gated in the bathroom. He doesn't cry at all when i do this because he is in the house with everyone instead of being locked up.     So there are a couple different things you can do to make it easier on him and yourself. The key is being patient and persistent.|`|1d9TrIKCaa	Okay this is exatly what my pup had probs with. When he howls, completely ignore him, and when he settles down, let him out and rewards him with treats. DO NOT let him out when he is howling...Try walking him and make him REALLY tired--Go for a bike ride and make him run with you|`|TtOCh3JSaa	You're going to have to ignore him as any other reaction will encourage your puppy to continue this behaviour as all he's looking for is attention. A good way is encourage him to stop, is buy a chew toy and everytime he starts howling, come back and take the toy out. When he stops, give it back to him but if he starts again, take it out. Animals rely on cognitive behaviour and he will associate the toy he likes with being quiet and a good boy and losing the toy with being loud. Best of luck with it.|`|2bkS1VIIaa	that is something he got used to so stop doing it or he will keep doing it.|`|A1vdJ0huaa	?|`|0LwtaKxgaa	Just ignore him, act like you do not care. Your sister has made him think that if he barks or whines you will open the crate, but if you keep ignoring him for couple of days he will forget it and give up. Just dont open the crate again or he will get use to it. The same happened with my dog. I opened it one night and he got spoiled and kept whining and crying but i ignored him and it worked he stopped and gave up. So my advice to u is just ignore him and let him bark and whine. Just tell ur neighbors u r having problems they will understand.|`|okdPuy1Kaa	IGNORE it! :) It can take a few days (and sleepless nights!)    How long is he in the crate for?! He shouldn't be left alone for very long periods of time!!    ~And WHO sold you a puppy at only 6 weeks old?! Bad breeder!|`|YV1bOajXaa	Maybe if you go to your neighbor and explain that for the next week or two your puppy might bark as you are in the process of training him.  Of course at night, youwill need to respond quicker to the yelps which might make it tough going.  You must let the puppy cry it out once in a while.  You are responding to his crying and reinforcing to him that if he cries, you will come and get him.  Of course, you must feed him, give him water, play with him and make sure he has plenty of potty breaks.|`|xz1Eqm47aa	talk to the neighbors try to make em understand and stick to your guns and the puppy will learn|`|GaL66jbQaa	Toys are your best friend the best way to keep a pup quiet is to keep them occupied.  they especially like toys that dispense treats.  for the first few weeks I had my dog I never fed it from a bowl.  I would do short training exercises with their dry food and the rest of the food I put in toys like a kong lined with  peanut butter or a tricky treats ball which you can get at Petsmart. There are lots of safe toy options don't leave puppy alone with a rope toy or any other toy that they can swallow little bits off of.  I also recommend training books by Ian Dunbar
kLPaq30Eaa	My sisters Yorkie does the same thing. The vet said that it's normal for a puppy to do so, and that eventually they'll grow out of it. You should probably work to stop that though, because I'm sure guests wouldn't like that.|`|oTHGgowsaa	If it's a puppy that's absolutely normal, it can be a part of teething or just what they do for fun.|`|8V9AHKVqaa	LoL my doggie does that when she plays. it is because when they are playing they, well, play. she is getting you to play with her. i have 2 dogs and they do that to be like " haha got you this time!! ". and if i walk away she will bite my ankles!!    hope i helped :D|`|A1vdJ0huaa	What nibbles mean?|`|IQZxdghGaa	She thinks you are made out of nibbly cheese|`|60ApQsGOaa	i have a siberian husky. He does the same thing. He loves me very much, so Im taking it as either a sign of submission or just love :)|`|v3v3TH3Aaa	probably teething. buy some chew toys. before she eats your socks.|`|mFsM9AgPaa	my puppy nibbles on us b/c shes teething...maybe her teeth hurt?|`|8JjUpc7uaa	the dog is just playing ... it knows biting would hurt so it just nibbles. it's tryign to tickle you *hehe*    -JY|`|5ntkYOY7aa	She is just playing, if you do not like it, scold her
HKoo2PfYaa	Wow - sorry to hear that and please keep me posted.  I think you are doing the right things - just allow him to rest for a while, and it is a good idea, like you mentioned, to check on him.  He probably was very shooken up and confused, but once he gets some rest and is back on track he will be just fine.    Also make sure he has plenty of water - being scared like that could dehydrate him.    I wish you the best of luck and hopefuly tomorrow your dog will be back to normal!|`|7Tesm2vwaa	You sound like you are doing the right things already. I hope he will be ok...|`|xz1Eqm47aa	take him to the vet.  electrocution can cause fluid to build up in the lungs and cause severe problems even tho he looks fine.|`|Aia7JuoMaa	first of all we need to know HOW he got electricuted   thats the main problem  i just wanted to know ...tehe|`|XyoyLia0aa	I dont think just a chew on a wire will hurt him, just scare him a little that happened to my rabbit once when it was hopping around the room....Im sure he'll be fine!|`|Zmlfu7xeaa	Just keep an eye on him, he should be fine.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Wow. your lucky hes doing so well considering how small he is.

I really don't know.|`|HimBbU6caa	Take him to a vet ASAP.

rP1OWD38aa	Probably all of the above but what I would suggest is that you give your sister more "bird" time if you want your bird to get used to her and interact with her.  The two cockatiels we had did tend to gravitate toward only one person in our home. Even though I trained them both, the female almost always went to my husband and the male came to me.  The only time the female would come to me is if she was frightened.  Otherwise, I was persona non grata to her.  That could be the case with your 'tiel.|`|2bZMxMitaa	Be around your sister when she with the bird, just to make sure the bird isn't too aggressive. Socialize it a lot more. Have your friends come over and maybe try to have the bird step up on their hands. Or even to just have your friends talk calmly to him. Have your sister fill his food and water dishes and hang millet for him. He needs to learn people aren't bad.|`|808179c0ca2fbd5aff003beb3f69e364aa	it sounds like one or both of two things. he wasn't pet much just fed by hand so he thinks you are food. or someone was mean to him so he doesn't trust them. so just time and keep trying when he bites them tell him no and have them try again while you are petting him lightly try that. it takes time
uBFhKXgHaa	You will not find a good, high quality cat food at any grocery store!     Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Excellent raw feeding information for cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  |`|uctxzjIIaa	As far as most grocery stores, I think the Whiskas Purrrrfectly Chicken/Fish lines are the best. They still have glutens in them unfortunately, but no meat byproducts.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Here's the info with many links. You can find the brands        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Nothing good comes from a grocery store, when it comes to pet food.

HKoo2PfYaa	Great question!    I have never found that any breeds make better companions for other breeds.    A Jack Russell Terrier with all their energy might drive a bloodhound crazy, but if they like each other, and both like to play, or both kike to take it easy, they will get along.    Beagles like to roam, so a dog that likes to play like that would be good.  We had a little Beagle once, and she liked to play with cats better than other dogs.LOl    She would get out of our fenced yard ( escape artist deluxe), and go to a creek about a mile from out house. there were woods there, and she would find skinks to play with. No, tomato juice DOES NOT get that scent out.LOl    How old is your dog?  I am assuming it lives in the house with the family?  I have also found that more than one male or more them one female or a mix of both works just as well.    Training and the attention they get it what determines more how they get along.  I simply do not tollerate fighting, I didn't in my children, and I don't in my animals.    Training does it so that nobody has to be the bad guy and yell.    Spay or neuter ALWAYS!    Besides preventing litters that end up as strays down the line, it is better for their health, and spaying and neutering when they are young, before they have been mated, actually prolongs their life span.  I say, get whatever kind of other breed YOU want to have one of, and introduce them easily, and let them get aquainted, train them in obedience well, and spay   /neuter.Treat them both with love, equally.  Just like you would teach two children to get along.    Just get the two you think of putting together, prefferbly on neutral ground first, and see how they take to each other.    Hope you found this helpful and good luck choosing your pal!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Get a dog her size or a little smaller.     Get a male.  That way you won't have fighting for Alpha B*TCH status.|`|28b7427cbd56f9826eed3719f67bd585aa	Any dog can get along with a beagle. If you are planning on a puppy, it would not come home larger than her (unless you're getting a GIANT breed, which even then, it would probably be the same size as her), so intimidating her probably won't be an issue. I would try and see what kind of dogs she seems to get along with best at the dog park (personality wise, not breed wise), and then telling any potential breeder or rescue/shelter. They usually have a good idea and can help pick a dog or puppy for you.
H06PtiIAaa	for conditioning at least 2 weeks with fatty foods.    fatty foods are like worms like frozen blood worms which really arent worms but also like frozen glass worms or tubiflex worms.

Those fish ( aside from the loaches) I KNOW are fairly easy to keep up with, and they look nice. Just make sure that if you get a semi-aggressive fish, that it is smaller than most of your other fish, if not all; otherwise it may want a mid-day snack.     Now if you were going salt water, I'd say go nemo. just get  a couple clown fish, a hippo thing ( i forget what it was really called, but it's Dory), and some of those really nice bright yellow fish, (the name as well excapes me at the time.)|`|vDB5sI9faa	if your experienced you could get a tiger oscar maybe discuss fish or some type of goby and you should keep java fern it grows slow so you don't need to cut it back its pretty and it reproduces easliy if you have lots of fish.
IMPvzBk1aa	The vet would hopefully know the needle placement used for the sedation and IV, and insert the needle below that site to draw for Coggins.  Because nothing is being injected or infused into the vein, there is minimal risk of dislodging a clot. Any inflammatory changes or clots from the previous sedation and IV would ideally be above the site he chose for the Coggins, and unless your horse has a vessel disorder rendering him prone to inflammation and forming clots any time a needle enters the vein, it should not be a problem.  In both events when clots were formed, irritants were injected or infused, which either caused inflammatory responses and clotting, or dislodged existing clots.  It is probably not the best idea to use the jugular again, but I don't necessarily think your vet was negligent in doing it.  I think what you read might have been referring to cases where the clotting causes the vein to become scarred and fibrous, so you can't use it for shots or blood pulls anymore because the vein is no longer functional.|`|jCWAYgaMaa	A Coggins Test isn't an injection- it's drawing blood. The way the body reacts is somewhat different.  So I believe that the vet did the right thing; especially since he is trained and you explained the problem to him, he should have known the correct thing to do.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	This sounds like a good reason to get a second opinion from a real vet, not just your current vet vs. "I read somewhere" (or YA people).  I think I would want to know, and if the answer is that she should not get needles in her jugular, then I would switch vets.

You could try putting one of those on her.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	Spray a product like Bitter Apple on the horse's mane.  It's non toxic but very yukky- I've only ever had one horse that wouldn't leave things alone that were sprayed with it.  And not too expensive, and is non-staining
bI7wMCJXaa	Yeah. Pointing a horse at a fence is bad.    Your horse isn't nuts, he's a thoroughbred and he's hot. TBs are hot horses. Make sure he's not getting too much grain. He should be good on 8 lbs per day if he's working (plus hay).    Circles. Lots of circles. No straight lines. Your horse is ignoring your aids, you're probably riding with your hands. If this is an OTTB the harder you pull the faster he's going to go. You  may also be overmounted.    You need to get back on, preferably with a trainer. Forget fancy bits. Get a bridle with a flash (or a figure 8, same thing) to keep his mouth closed on the bit. If he takes off with you again pick a rein and PULL. Pull the rein all the way back to your hip. He won't run when he can't see and he won't let himself fall over. His choice at that point is to stop.    Did you stay on over the fence? Maybe you should be eventing...|`|8bTder08aa	There are two safe things you can do:    1.  Get a trainer to work with your horse;    Or,    2.  Sell him.    FWIW, ask any trainer, they'll tell you the worst wrecks they see are when someone is seriously overmounted (riding a horse beyond their capability to control).      Seriously, get help before you get hurt.|`|RloOJ43haa	Karin C is right on the money on this one.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Well the good news in all of this is that your horse is talented enough to jump a 4'6" arena wall!! My advice would be to send him to a trainer for a a few months... or work closely with an experienced instructor. If you don't feel comfortable riding him then don't. He will only sense your fear and become more and more unpredictable/dangerous. In the meantime you can do in hand work with him as well as lounging.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Thoroughbreds are powerful horses and they are quite strong animals. I leased a thoroughbred and assisted in the training of 4 others that were both off the track and never raced.    Some thoroughbreds need experienced handlers and it sounds like yours is one. 4'6 is a high jump and it isn't safe to take that as a non-breakaway fence.     I would enlist somebody with experience to help you as you don't sound experienced enough to handle this situation. Get an experienced instructor and maybe work in an indoor arena so he can't go anywhere. Lunge him before you get on and maybe use a stronger bit so you have some brakes while you train and maybe a martingale. But remember, thoroughbreds are sporthorses and they will run and jump.     Good Luck!|`|6GehblM3aa	If you are scared, don't ride him, it will only make matters worst.  Find a professional trainer to send him to or to help you work with him.|`|j77Yqrlnaa	You're lucky he cleared it.      Next time, try either riding him in a smaller space or circling him tightly if he tries running off with you. Personally, I'd get an experienced trainer on him. My horse has been running off with me, but we have an indoor so he can't jump walls.|`|oABeOeTzaa	If you are afraid to ride your horse do not ride him. Get a professional horse trainer to calm him down. You being afraid of him will make all matters worse and cause him to become afraid of being ridden, as horses can sense stress and fear from their riders. Thoroughbreds are my favorite breed of horse to own as they are very difficult to deal with some times, but that is natural as they are hot blooded horses, and I am generally a hypoactive person. If you yourself are more of a hyperactive individual you should not own a hyperactive horse as your personalities would most certainly clash. Your horse will most likely never completely be able to be worked out of this since it is in his personality to do as he is doing. But as of now, it is in yours and your horses best intentions to hire a professional trainer|`|vxhQWwaHaa	i think you should try to get back on him, but first make sure you lounge the hell out of him so he is tieed,and that you have a trainer with you so they can help yuo deal with him
XI2iylR4aa	YES!  And usually the posts contain a lot of info that indicates that the kid is NOT ready for a pet.  I usually tell them their parents are right, which doesn't make me the most popular person around!|`|rlvrgwWvaa	Me too. Why can't they just search the previous questions thingy?|`|8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	I hear you. The only question that is worse is the "do you think I'm pretty - rate me" questions.|`|kjW1fmmPaa	It's definitely in my top 3 most annoying questions asked on this site:    1) How do I convince my parents to let me get a pet?  2) Could I be pregnant?!?!  3) Is my friend pretty? (it's usually not their friend, it's them) OR Who is prettier, left or right? OR Am I pretty [PICS]??|`|UvPUopA8aa	Yes and the sad news is it gets way worse in the summer kids are out of school. And it seem they have nothing better to do than to come on here ask how can they convince such an such to let them get a pet.  _________  By the way Katie that was great blog post I can't agree with you more on those.|`|wc9viY4Saa	Yes, a little annoyed..If you can't come up with your own way to convince your parents..That probably means you aren't ready to own an animal.|`|t6UkxbBNaa	OMG!!!!!! I HATE THOSE QUESTIONS!!!|`|d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	I see quite a bit of horses, but I also seem to see a ton of ferret ones, too. (It might just be that I answer mostly ferret questions) I think I've asked it once or twice, but usually because I had a specific thing I was trying to figure out. I mean, so many people ask it that just search it in the search bar- I'm sure someone almost meets what you are like!     Although I agree with horses- they are a huge commitment, expensive, and need lots of room, but with other animals, sometimes parents don't really have much of a reason to say no. When someone only has a dog and wants 2 rats, I just go "come ON! Just let them get the rats." Because 3 pets isn't /that/ many, and rats have tons of myths that can ruin their reputation.|`|iU2fQBtRaa	Not really no. xD     but there is a lot.|`|2D1uxlUfaa	MOST DEF!~!!! If the parents wont buy a pet, why cant they just accept it and wish for the day they can be independent?|`|Apisf1gAaa	That, among other things.  I made a blog post about that...    http://kaitiek.wordpress.com/2009/01/25/...  (language)
tDcItiATaa	Ich is the most common disease related to that symptom.  The term for it i think is "glancing".  It may not be ich though, it may not be a disease of any sort. Though it could be the begining to a disease. The fish obviously has something annoying him, here is something going on, though this could last for months and not lead to disease!..   Pay close attention to the fish, see if there is any differences in it, eg, coloration, spots, blured eyes, really slimy coat, sluggishness, etc. More than likely i am guessing that there is nothing out of the ordinary other than what you have mentioned?..    The tank would benifit from a few 50% water changes over a fortnight period. That with good fiter maintanence and maybe a reliable product like GEO Liquid should clear things up.    Check the water quality, take some to a pet store for second testing, be sure to syphon the substrate well, look for rotting plants, dead plant leaves, etc.    If the fish still continues to glance then just watch it carefuly, It should reduce if it does not stop. It is still active? I am asuming so?... I think it will be fine in any case.    hope this helps.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	You fish has a parasite.  Take a very close look at it's side and the gills.  There are a number of parasites that your fish can have so pay very good attention then get a book about fish diseases or go to a LOCAL PET STORE that specializes in fish, not a big box, and get their advice.  This is where you should be buying your fish anyway.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	usually a sign of external parasites....    may be ich    may be flukes    no biggie...    lots of meds to fix this|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Sounds like ich, do you see tiny white spots on your fish?, If so, then it's ich. There is medication at your local petshop.|`|487pYnzraa	Ya, think he has white spot disease. Look at ur fish carefully if there's white spots..if there is go to fish shop to get the medicine..just tell them what is the symptom like and they will be able to get u the medicine..it cost less than $10.. change the water 3-4days after (change 1/2 tannk only if possible) till ur fish recovers.
iU2fQBtRaa	Diarrhea is what she is having probably. If you take her to the vet they can give you some medication. You should clip some of the hair around her tail and bum, so the poop doesn't get stuck.       Hope your rabbit gets better!|`|8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	The first question is have you changed her food recently? Pet rabbits, are like babies and do not always deal well with changes to their diets. So anytime you change or add something in your pet rabbit's diet, you should do so gradually, one food at a time, and look for adverse reactions, such as low appetite or loose stool. A rabbit's digestive tract is inhabited by healthful bacteria. If the "good" bacteria balance is upset by stale food or a sudden change in diet, harmful bacteria can take over the digestive track and kill the bunny.|`|gWMBy2HMaa	poop is normal to be smelly.
X0Jkmx0Maa	i just got a emerald tree boa 4 months ago at first i just bought a log  and 30 gal tall  i was going to get lil by lil. the first week the snake was damn near life less so i bite the bullet and  had to spend about $200-$250 for all nessesary climate control (and tank). i had to get something for the humidity and digital read out, was about $80,I put it in with the water and soon discovered that the tank fills up with water about 1-2 inches for 24 hrs. i had pine so that didnt work, and the log will get moldly.so to fixs both problems i got fish gravel a large tupper ware bowl for the humidifier in the corner of the tank gravel the rest a inch or two put the wood log ins and got babboo stems and leaves and used it for green life, they die after 3-4 weeks though to drain the bottom of the tank put air tube for fish tank and syphine the water then i bought a lamp for heat but the water in the air make the bulbs exsplode tried more than once so the i just got a heat pad observe how look humid its is with digital read out and when in proper areas shut off when goes down you can turn on and get your average and set a electric timer my average is 80-90% day 40-50% night i .my wood log every week and half or so. to prevent mold.after i up graded the snake was very active, but they are high maitennance but worth it so my advice buy everything you need at once to prevent the least stressful environment
FvAl3UgQaa	Hi there,    For starters, you need to research Testudo marginata.     Don't worry about the growing to be 200lbs thing - I think you're getting confused with G.sulcata.     Adult Marginated tortoises are more in the region of 10 or 11lbs and max out at about 12-14" long.    For basic care info., these articles are a good place to start:     http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/Ba...    http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/vi...    http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/we...|`|MX9M36B4aa	google it
iU2fQBtRaa	No, but a lot of pet stores have Pet Shampoo or special cream/soap stuff for there face or paws. If it says on the bottle that it is okay for use on animals, then yes, it is alright. But I would get a soap/shampoo specially made for animals, so your cat doesn't get infected or sick from the soap. Especially if she cleans herself/himself afterwards, and finds themself feeling sick to the stomach, mouth or throat. It might give your cat digestive problems or poo problems also.|`|ngebYukSaa	no, dont use dettol on a cat. It will likely be WAY too strong for a cats sensitive skin.    Use something that a vet has recommended. Some things that are ok for us to use are NOT ok for cats.    eg: we can eat onions, but onions will make a cats kidneys fail. Dog flea treatment will kill a cat etc.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	No...use only soaps that are made for cats..|`|GduRpnn0aa	Do not use Dettol on your cat. Dettol stings when used on humans, can you imagine how much worse that sting is for cats??    If you are wanting to use Dettol as an antiseptic treatment for your cat then rather use Feline First Aid Spray. http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-first-ai...    An all-natural herbal product, it's safe and non-toxic. At the same time, it's highly effective in treating minor cat wounds and skin problems:    Anti-fungal, anti-bacterial   Prevents infection   Repels insects   Speeds healing   Reduces pain   Non-toxic, no harsh chemicals     Feline First Aid spray contains soothing aloe vera, plus a carefully-formulated blend of germ-fighting herbs. Applied to wounds or hot spots, it helps reduce pain, decrease healing time and prevent infection.     Clean the wound as well as you can, dry it, then apply Feline First Aid Spray. It'll help your cat's wound heal quickly and safely, while relieving pain. It also keeps insects away, preventing them from contaminating the site of injury.    Other recommended preventative measures include covering the affected area and clipping your pet's nails to minimize the ill affects of scratching.    You could also bathe your cat using Neem Soap, which you can purchase through same company above. It acts as an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and insect repellant soap for cats.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I adore the names you've chosen, one of my rats is named Mercutio.    Please do not perform potentially detrimental experiments on your boys. Healthy popcorn is a fine treat every once in awhile, so hopefully this experiment didn't last very long. I'd be awfully peeved at my parents if they had fed me popcorn for shy of a year just for the sake of an experiment. (Considering a rat's lifespan, one week is like almost a year for a human.) Just like humans and all other animals, rats require the proper diet to be healthy. They need certain nutrients just like us.    Rats are typically incredibly tough about pain, which is why it can sometimes be difficult to tell if they're ill or injured. Hissing is also very uncommon, as it is usually reserved for the biggest of offenses. Now, it's possible you just have a drama-rat, but I'd definitely take him to the vet if I were you. An abrupt change in personality can be the biggest indicator that something is wrong, and it could literally be almost anything. Keep a close eye on him. If he continues this behavior, do take him to the vet. Some other common signs of pain or illness are arching in pain, sitting hunched up, ungroomed fur, lethargy and lack of appetite. Hopefully he'll be back to normal by tomorrow.|`|rwYL9H8Uaa	My Rat Sophie will stare at her neighbor Gigi, who lives in another cage, jump up and down, puff up and make poofing sounds while trying to grab at her. You rat is trying to show that he dominant, and he wanted to assert his authority. Seperate them if it gets really bad. Spraying they with a spray bottle, or giving them some tasty food can help, as they will concentrate on something else. When it comes to  defecating many rats hide when they use the bathroom. They are pray animals and they don't want to be seen when they feel vulnerable. If you have a litter pan, check it, and look around the enclosure if you see rat poo, they should be fine. My rats eat pop corn, and their fine. You may need to seperate them, but they usually mellow out with age :)|`|I6KKFwxXaa	I have given my girls pop corn before and they didn't respond that way it could be a display of trying to figure out who is the dominant rat and who is going to be in charge. you make it sound like you have them in separate cages when you said you was going to take him out to play with the other one I have 3 of mine in the same cage but then I have all girls my newest one is to small for the cage my older 3 are in so she has a separate cage and I hate it because I know from just having her around the other 3 they wouldn't hurt her. You should have them in the same cage so they are not alone|`|YqVtOSWwaa	If this only happened once, chances are it is fine. Rats can display as great of an array of emotions as people do. He may have been spooked, or is just cranky from having a bad day.    Popcorn is terrible to be feeding him. It is very likely it, and the sudden switch from and back to normal food, is causing indigestion and he might be having stomach pains. No one here is a vet, so no one will know if it is nothing to do with popcorn, or it is actually causing a poor reaction.    Wait it out for 1 or 2 more days. If you still think he is acting strange, then take him to a vet. He is your pet, and his life is your responsibility. You basically sacrificed his health with your experiment, so you should be willing to help him, even if it means paying for a vet.
IMPvzBk1aa	If he does it fine when he is longeing, then it doesn't sound like he has a favored lead. Does he move well on the longe line when he is on the right lead?  I would observe closely for any restricted or unbalanced movement. Either he has a medical issue, or the saddle fit may be a problem, or something in the way you are balanced, or cueing may be the cause.  But if it were just you, others would be able to get him onto the lead.  so it sounds like a pain issue when he is under saddle.  Some issues are not apparent until the weight of a rider is introduced.  Unless you and your friends all ride pretty much the same, it is likely that he needs to be evaluated for a medical cause or saddle fit issue.  Can you get him on the lead riding bareback?  If you can, then that would help to narrow down whether it may be from  the saddle.  If not, then the weight of a rider seems to be a problem.  I would write down all of the observations you can, and then call your vet and make an appointment to evaluate the horse for any lameness or back pain issues.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Have somebody lunge him in a circle so he is constantly bending into the right rein and leg. When he is bent in properly and is on a circle, he will most likely pick up his correct lead. Some breeds have harder times with right leads especially off the track horses. Gradually take him off the lunge and keep asking him on a circle and in corners. Then ask him in random places. Good luck|`|iiNAJfGCaa	There is always a reason a horse doesn't pick up one lead. It could be pain, poor muscling, an unbalanced rider... or maybe that is just his "bad" side. Horses, just like people, are "left handed" and "right handed." For the first year my OTTB absolutely refused to pick up his left lead. After months of walk/trot work to the left (lots of circling, hill work, lounging) he now does not have a problem. He was simply poorly developed on that side of his body and was not physically capable of leading with his left inside. Take the time to determine why he isn't picking up his right lead. If you try to solve the issue by simply "cranking his head" to the inside every time you want the right lead, you're just masking the problem... not solving it.|`|y7H1V39Jaa	The easiest way to teach your horse to ALWAYS take the correct lead is to ALWAYS position him to succeed.  The stride begins from the rear, so position your horse's rear (don't get me wrong,. keep his body straight) but with your left leg behind the girth, gently push until he gives and just push his hind end over to the right...and as soon as you feel him going there, pick him up (lift your reins and lay him down) into the canter...where the hind end goes, his front end will follow...sounds backwards doesn't it?  That's how it works...it's all positioning and timing and soon, you can be very subtle about your aids and not have to exaggerate them so much.  Keep working on the right lead all of the time until it becomes natural to him, then begin integrating the left lead back in.  This method works very well, as it is simply using common sense.|`|pMMcEvFsaa	Here is what I do with my gelding...he didn't know his leads or anything wen I got him , so my trainer gave me this tip, and it works like a charm!    Okay, so we all know that you should pick up your canter in the corner...blah blah blah...but do we know why? First of all, the horse is more willing coming out of a corner, because they slow down slightly (even though we may not feel it), so they speed up slightly coming out of it! So, anyways, while you are turning a corner (let's say you're tracking left), start asking your horse to pick up his left lead right before going into the corner. If your horse picks up the canter in the corner (not before or after, but IN the corner) he needs to support himself while coming out of the corner with his left leg (or inside leg at this point)......and Viola! He has picked up his left lead! You know what's also great about this technique is that he's picking it up naturally to support himself, so it's not like you're forcing him into it or anything.
9JwiZOL6aa	The most efficient solution in my opinion is to make a corner of the tank into an aquatic area by sectioning it off with sloped acrylic panels held together with silicone. many horizontal grooves should by cut in the panels to give your turtle traction. Make sure the silicone has no mildew inhibitors in it. Next have a hole drilled for a bulkhead in the side of the tank where the water will be. what you will have will basically be an aquatic portion of the tank that can be quickly drained for a water change at the flick of your wrist. It may sound like a big project but it is really quite simple. I recommend letting a local experienced business any drilling/cutting on your tank. Most places that make acrylic and glass displays for stores and museums will be good places use. I wouldn't look into a filter because they won't do even close to a good job at cleaning all of the waste from a box turtle.  The project shouldn't cost more than 40 bucks, and is very helpful. Plants are another thing. because box turtles produce so much waste and tend to bulldoze most plants, it isn't very practical to plant directly into the soil unless you have like 10sqft of floorspace and about a foot of soil, then you could plant maybe a small ficus or something, but you would hardly ever see the turtle. What might work good would be putting potted plants in the enclosure. A sideways cinder block would make a sturdy safe place for the plants. Make sure any plants you use are safe for your turtle though. That's really smart using a paint roller thing for a water area though, I wish i thought of that : )|`|2YIxnXXyaa	There's nothing you can do about the dirty water or from them walking on plants.  Box turtles are forestry creatures, they love plants and humidity.  Fake plants will not do, they could try to eat them and well..that's no bueno.  How big is it?  It might like to go outside, try to build an enclosure for it outside.  If you want to do that, that includes a LOT of plants, non/dead leaves, a sprinkler system to provide the humidity, water for him to get into, and a place for them to eat.  But if you're going to keep him in the tank, about once or twice a week, let him go outside (If you don't live in a snowy area) and let him walk around and soak up the natural sunlight.
e9gXZsKxaa	Try frozen brine shrimp or bloodworms, most fish won't turn down brine shrimp or bloodworms. Your fish is relevantly new still, so it's probably still getting use to it's surroundings.|`|XIhG1u7caa	Do not worry, this happened with my fish too. They are just not accustomed to their surroundings. They will eventually eat.  ? ???
HKoo2PfYaa	Great question!    Pets and people sneeze for two reasons. Either the membranes that line their nose are inflamed or a foreign object of some sort is present in the nostrils.    Nasal membranes become inflamed either because the pet was exposed to a chemical irritant or it has contracted a respiratory tract infection.     Infectious Rhinitis or Sneezing:    By far, most of the sneezing pets that I see have contracted upper respiratory tract infections. Some times the only symptom of the infection is sneezing. In people, we would call it a cold. Pet colds are caused by airborne virus and bacteria. The two most common cold viruses of dogs are the Parainfluenza virus and Type-2 Adenovirus. Both are highly infectious and are passed by sneezes from other sick dogs or from dogs that silently carry the infection. It is very common for the owners of sneezing pets to tell me that their baby was boarded, groomed or exposed to neighboring pets or a doggy park within the past two week. Pets that were recently obtained from animal shelters are also more likely to have these infections.    Very young and very old pets are more at risk. This is because the immune system of young animals is not fully developed. Older pets often have some age-related changes of the nasal membranes that make infections worse.     Bacteria can also cause sneezing. Both cats and dogs are susceptible to bacterial upper respiratory tract infections caused by Pasteurella, Bordetella, Streptococci and pseudomonad bacteria. Bordatella and Adeno-2 are two of the causes of kennel cough. Many of these bacteria are not particular about whose nose or eyes they irritate and can cause similar problems in you. Some pets silently carry these bacteria and virus in their system. Although they appear perfectly healthy they can spread the infections to all the animals that they contact. It is quite common for two or more organisms to be involved simultaneously in respiratory tract infections.    Allergies  Although most allergies in pets are exhibited as itching, some pets sneeze due to pollens and mold in the air.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dogs can have allergies to some cleaning products. Especially those that make your home smell nice.

zeTGmB3faa	Sounds like your ole cat is having some bladder or kidney problems. May be an infection. Urinating out of the box is how cats react when they have one of these infections. It appears that they associate the litter box with painful urination. Take your cat to the vet, they will do a test. If it is a bladder or kidney infection, antibiotics will clear it up. They may recommend a special diet if his kidneys show any early signs of malfunction.|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	she could have a urinary tract infection. that sometimes causes cats to pee on things. if she seems like shes in pain when she pees, take her to the vet. they will give her something that should take care of the problem.|`|Z747Yj02aa	I have a cat that is 18 years old and she does the exact same thing.  My house was beginning to smell even though I'd clean it up all the time and so I now keep her in the garage.  I don't know what to do either but keeping her in the garage prevents the smell for disturbing my home and cleanliness...|`|Mv2KO7n0aa	I just recently had a 17 yr old cat put to sleep because she started peeing on the carpet ... the vet thought she had diabetes and arthritis.  It was all of a sudden that she started doing this, and she had several health problems in the last few years, so I decided that she would probably just keep suffering.  There could be several reasons why your cat is peeing ... it could be a urine infection or she may have arthritis and have trouble getting inside the box now.  I would call your vet to see if they can test her to find out if there is something medically wrong with her.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	she might be getting senile.  If you've changed laundry soap she may not like the smell|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	She might have a urinary infection...take her to the vet and get it checked out...|`|zgDQrI2uaa	This sounds like you need to go to the vet.  A change in bathroom behavior could indicate a serious medical problem.|`|1T0MQ5zwaa	There could be 2 reasons for her to be doing this.    1. She wants attention and you're not giving it to her or something new came into her environment and she's showing her dissatisfaction.    or    2. She could have a bladder infection.  I would take her to a vet to get her checked out just in case to be on the safe side.  Also, if you notice some blood in her urine, then it might be something more serious. :(|`|1827d79e1a59bbeb213b8e03785ba568aa	i just asked the same question about an hour ago. the only difference is that my cat is only 8 years old, and it's only on towels. i called the vet a little bit ago, and they said  its either 2 things. a UTI, or a behavior problem. good luck.
AA12189965	its a steal!!! there around 350.00|`|iiNAJfGCaa	$50 for a 300 gallon horse trough? I would take it and run!|`|7PAGYzdhaa	That Is a great deal, I would grab that deal!!!|`|aKSicRp9aa	thats a good deal if it doesn't leak.
RyNvYrJmaa	if he stays outside the first thing i think of is lyme disease..it can cause fevers (hence the panting) and joint pain (which sometimes makes them pant due to the pain) which tends to be non-specific. if you see him limping or especially stiff on one leg, then later it seems to be a different leg then thats a classic sign of lyme disease.   i'd recommend getting him tested for lyme, as well as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis, which are usually all done in one test called a 4DX test as they are all tick diseases and all cause similar symptoms. they are all treatable and he could be feeling much better pretty quickly with antibiotics if thats what it is.|`|DAg1Hejmaa	theres no need to be nasty, we all just want to help.  Now, are there any snakes or red ants in your yard, ticks anything like that?  Check his coat, face all over to see if there is a bite of some kind.  especially check his neck area there are all kinds of vermin in the dirt and trees animals just want to play, red ants especially can cause alot of distress to our pups.  check the nose are see if he got into an anthill   then call the vet he might help you over the phone,  check him first.  good luck|`|afPzgCSHaa	I think you should take him to the vet ASAP!  or call your vet. It might be something serious i'm not so sure  maybe something in your backyard that was poisonous bit him  or something. Im not sure.  But good luck! hope he gets better.|`|IZKBRqp7aa	why do you keep him outside all the time....|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	could be heart worms|`|LlGx1s7taa	he's prob thinking about running away from home.  he doesn't love you anymore|`|Y4pfVX10aa	take him to the vet ASAP and y do u keep him outside all the time|`|sOkePjK3aa	Take him to a vet. Then when he gets home, BRING HIM INSIDE!!! Why do you keep ur pup outside? That's so sad. You wouldn't want to be left outside forever, would you? >:[|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Doesn't sound good.  Have your vet check him out.|`|UJUEn2GZaa	first how old is he? 2nd does he have heart or lung problems, maybe he is having a doggy siezure|`|iIry4mRzaa	Your dog may have a heart problem, seems like he may be in pain.
