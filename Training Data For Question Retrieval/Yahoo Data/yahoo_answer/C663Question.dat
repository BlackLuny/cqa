20090227073847AAvnoUe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people say that looks don't matter?	First off let me just say that to ME looks really DON"T matter...BUT, why is it that the best looking ppl are the ones to marry first and have the best jobs and whatnot....I mean, if looks don't matter then why is it that the chunky girl with the  brains and huge heart is still single, while the hot sexy thin chick who couldnt figure out what 23x54 is with a CALCULATOR  is getting hit on left and right!!! Dont dare tell me looks don't matter when crap like this goes on EVERY gosh darn day of this life. Oh and I also dont wanna hear "well the chunky, smart, kind hearted ones are the ones that win in the end.." becuz thats not true either. I want real honest answers especially from you dudes...NOTE: im not saying that this ALWAYS happens either!! so a pre warning to all you ppl who are gonna start talking crap and saying..."well im chunky and i got a great man blah blah blah!!!"....i KNOW its not always like the way im describing. Im simply asking why is it like that the majority of the time...
20090227074015AAycIKu	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Men: how would you react if your newly wedded wife bought you a ring?	My husband and I have been married for two weeks now, and because of us not having such a large income, we wed through the Justice of the Peace. What made me feel a little more sad is we didn't have rings. My husband said he would buy them, but I know he hasn't looked any where and I'm not wearing one. The other day I was curious so I decided to look on ebay and found a huge bargain for a 18K white gold wedding band, and decide to purchase it for him. How would you guys feel if your new wife bought you a wedding bed? If by chance this has happened to you, how was your reaction?

20090227075429AAtn3xN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl im interested in (her friends)?	hello. Ok so to make a story short, I was walking to lunch one day and this girl Ive seen before is coming towards me. I look at her, she looks at me and smiles (we hold it until we walk past each other). Now I dont know if it is me but when I see her friends, they notice and look at me, a couple seem to like me even (which I think is stupid, all her friends like me). It could be a coincidence or im just telling myself this. We have never met each other before so I dont know her friends would do this. Is this just me or are her friends actually doing it? Thanks!

Like, when I have guy friends or girl friends who has had sex lately and they say how much their in love, I get left out and love sickens me, also it makes me hate mortals even more. I wish I could have the same way of life as they can. Im a virgin and I wish I wasn't. I know I'm just sixteen but also I'm very mature. I'm afraid that if I do have sex with someone I love or someone who I am willing to try with, I might do something very bad. What should I do?
20090227080836AApnRfL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I wrong for being angry at my friend?	My friend and I knew each other for about 2 years and in that time we were inseparable.  I had a bf when we met but then we broke up, and she never had a boyfriend during our entire friendship.      During the last few months, I started dating a guy we both knew, he was the bartender at the place we always hung out at.  We fell in love instantly and I moved in with him (we are still together).       My friend started getting jealous and angry and it seems liked I had two boyfriends and she was just way too controlling.  I started noticing things about her that I never did before.  She enjoyed seeing other people unhappy, demanding of your time and very spiteful.  She had some great qualities too but these ones in particular really started to bother me.        My boyfriend owns a bar and there is a young waitress that works there and I noticed my friend was just HATING on this girl.  She was trying to put ideas in my mind that this girl was going to sleep with my boyfriend (she is a bit promiscuous) and all sorts of other ideas.  It started causing problems with me and my man.  Finally I had it and I finally said something to her that I didn't want to hear anything more about this girl again and if she didn't like her to just stay away from her.  This is my boyfriend's place of business and it is disrespectful.  She tried weaseling in a few more ideas into my head but I wasn't having it.      About a week later, she went into my boyfriends bar and started a fight with this girl.  That was the straw that broke the camels back.      I feel as though she has no respect for anyone and does whatever she wants.  Her favorite phrase was "I don't care".      I haven't spoken to her in about a month and although she has apologize, I ignore her emails.  I am not like this normally but I just always feel anxious and on edge when she emails me.  She is like a ticking time bomb of emotions.      Am I wrong for ending our friendship?      There was definetly a build up of things other then this happening throughout the months but these are the primary reasons I no longer speak to her.  Let me know if I am just being angry and spiteful.

He says since I am so young and from upstate NY and he is 38 and from NYC he knows more and he is helping me. He constantly calls me a baby and innocent. It is insulting to me but when I tell him he laughs. He is super jealous also. A guy just looked at me in a club and he hit him with his scarf. When I display jealousy he freaks out. He has never been married but was in two five yr. relationships. I wonder why they both ended? I wonder if he was this way with them? They were his age or older so maybe not. Please help me!

20090305045940AAZ6wS8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My fiance talks to his ex girlfriend and another girl he used to swap nude photos with b4 we were together?	Am i justified being jealous and angry about his continuing relationship with these two women , no matter how apparently innocent they are?  I severed all ties with people that i had met online in a sexual capacity after my fella and i became serious, and i feel like he should have done the same.  He talks occassionally with a girl from the states and their conversations are quite straight forwards but with an underlying flirtation like " oh your girlfriend is so lucky to have you lol" and him saying that if her husband came to australia that he hoped she would came too as hed love to meet her in person.   AS for his ex girlfiend, it too is sort of innocent but it annoys the hell out of me, as they will talk for  hours while im at work, , and although my fella says she wants to be friends with "us", she hardly says anything to me on the phone and just asks to speak to him if she calls whilst i am home.    I had an ex boyfriend that called me up not too long ago, and my fella got miffed about it, so out of courtesy to him and our relationship, i told my ex that it was not approriate to call again or send emails.     I really need some clarity here from everyone.  Am i justified being angry about his "friends" or am i just being an insecure paranoid selfish immature *****?

20090305072402AAJxdJE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this girl acting like this?	Ok i'm in college and theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back at home that goes to another college and I think they seem really close with each other. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I got the feeling that she liked me but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being friends but she still avoids me. She stoped sitting next to me in class and 3 days later i got a text saying she needed a while cause it was awkward and she said she loves her b/f, and she wasnt sure how i got the impression i liked her. now is she lying when she said she really doesnt like me and why is she acting like this if were goin be friends? Oh and i even caught her stairing at me a couple of times after this whole situation happened. So why is she actin like this and what do I do about it?

My fiance only has two family members here in the states. All his family is back in his country mexico and they odviously can't come to the wedding. One of his sisters live here and they don't speak to each other because they had a fight about something when his mother died about a year ago and the other brother that's here is in jail.    Now my fiance has alot of friends in his job but because he's a chef and works in a restaurant all these people will be working on the saturday of the wedding and won't be able to make it to the wedding. So he won't be having anybody from his social circle in the wedding.   It didn't really bother me or him because we been together for 5 years and my family is like his family but i was talking to my brother and he told me that is was amazing that there won't be not one person from my fiance's side in the wedding. I never really thought about it until after i spoke to my brother. Have you ever been to a wedding like this? do you think it's weird?   thanks in advance

(taling wont work, we've talked about it plenty)

20090305121538AAvsZGe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I convince my mom to loosen up...(I cant hug ((sexually)), kiss, date, or do anything to guys)?	my mom is very religious   and wants me to wait before I do anything before marriage   she saw photos of me and my boyfriend holding hands on facebook and got really mad. And its unreasonable for someone to expect that.      Now im in a serious relationship and we might, and probably will, have sex. we've talked about it and are responsible. and I really do love him.   (Im 15 by the way)   How should I tell my mom that its not bad to kiss before marriage, that it doesnt make me a **** or unholy or people see less of me?

20090305123230AAn0R8p	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please, please help! I am married and things aren't good, what do I do?	I know giving up on your marriage is wrong. And truly my husband is a very sweet man and I know I have made mistakes too. But when we met I was only 17 and he was 25, we dated for a long time and got married when I was 25 and he was 33, we have been married for close to 2 years now.       He is 8 years older than me and even though while we dated I did break things off twice because I felt I needed freedom and to sew some oats (but during those times he would not leave me alone he would constantly call check up on me and drive by my apartment when he knew I was with a guy he would call cabs to my house for them to call me and interrupt the time I was having with the guy) well anyway sometimes I still feel like I didn't live enough and not just that but in our first year of marriage I got a call from a man who informed me my husband was emailing his wife dirty things and they were going back and forth about meeting up when she suggest oh with your wife and my husband with us he said “oh no I was thinking just you and me, guess I am being selfish and oh when I see you I wouldn’t be able to stand up because something would be sticking straight up” he apologized and said nothing happened he just got carried away and never would have met up and I chose to forgive him but there was another time I caught him texting a girl.       I confronted him last night about how these things still bother me (close to a year later) he apologized over and over said he would do anything to make this work with me that I am all he has ever wanted and wants to grow old with me can't believe he was so stupid and will do ANYTHING. Since then he has been all over me he won’t give me room to breath and makes me feel without me he is nothing.       It’s a lot of pressure for me because I feel unsure about our relationship but since he knows that he will not give me any space he is trying to plan trips, talk about having babies and texts and calls me non-stop. Beyond all this I have gotten very close to a guy that I have been friends with for years and have grown feelings for him, it breaks my heart to hurt my husband and nothing has happened with the friend, but isn’t it bad enough I have had thoughts and that my marriage is this messed up so early?? What do I do, I am so at a loss. I am afraid to leave because we have a beautiful home and life is comfortable but I am young and feel things shouldn’t be this way already and I don’t feel completely satisfied and happy with my husband but he acts like “he will do anything” and is totaling kissing my *** which makes me feel even worse.       Please someone with experience or knowledge in this department please offer help and advice! I feel so sad and depressed lately and can’t talk to my husband because the moment he thinks I question us he suffocates me to death almost.          AT DO I DO?? I am so lost and never thought I would be at this point in my life so young.

20090305130247AASgnGj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you saw this, what would you think?	You see a man and a woman who know each other standing together but not talking. You know that the man is a total flirt, he flirts with every woman all the time and loves to be surrounded by females. You know that he and the woman are friends for years, but he is not flirting with her, they are not even talking or looking at one another. Out of character for both and in particular the man. She seems down in herself. He is actually standing behind her. You go up to the woman, smile at her and tell her how beautiful you think she is. The other man says nothing, doesnt even make a joke when he sees that the woman has gotten embarrassed. The man goes to walk away, but he doubles back and speaks to her, but in a very businesslike manner, almost aggressively. What would you think is going on and why would you compliment the woman?

I have asked her what's going on before, and she said all her relationships go like this, that she thinks about me every day, she wants me but worries b/c she wants to want us but says it's like she is afraid to let herself just be happy.  So, is she scared, psycho, or done and trying to bow out quietly?

20061031024340AAGh3uq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok ladies i need your advice please.?	Ok so when this girl i like told me she likes me i was excited.I mean i was about to tell her i liked her but she told me first. however, she also told me she couldnt allow us to be anything more than friends because her friend likes me as well. i understand the not wanting to hurt her friend part and respect her deeply for it. then she asked me not to tell her friend she likes me when i offered to explain to her friend that likes me i didnt have feelings for her. but what struck me as odd was why did the girl i like tell me she likes me if she didnt want anything to come from it? I mean was there some secret message i missed? when she said she couldnt let anything happen between her and I is that some way of her telling me I need to be the one to get us from just friends to possibly dating? I am a little confused and some advice would be greatly appreciated

20090305125939AA5ottp	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Baby + wedding = Drama?	ok so his side of the family has finally agreed to let the baby thing go.  We had a huge blowout and my fiance and I didnt back down and his parents ended up saying that they would not bring it up again but they arent happy with our choice (this is their 1st grandchild)        We are fine with them not being happy.  I dont expect them to be happy, but I do ask that they respect our choice, which they are.      They have told us that the babies father (fiances brother in law) has said that he wont be coming to the ceremony, just the dinner and party.  His wife (fiances sister) is in the wedding party, so will be there all day of course.  The BIL says that he cant be away form the baby (who will be 1 1/2 by then) for that long.  Fine-BUT-the 2 of them just took a week long vacation out of town and left the baby with his mother the whole time!!  I'm sure hes saying he wont come to make a point.      I dont care if he comes or not but my fiance is hurt because he was in his sister wedding and did a lot for them that day and now he gets this in return.  Im also annoyed that he wont come to a 45 min ceremony but will show up for the free food and bar (that we're paying for!)      My fiance wants to confront him because neither of them have actually told us yet.  My opinion is to wait and let him come to us.  He is being such a baby telling everyone but us about this, so I figiure he can be the one who has the break the news.      What do you think? (wedding is on Aug. 15 2009)      PS I've said it before and I'll say it again--do not tell me that kids should be there, that he's family too, blah blah blah.      Thanks!

20061021123321AADREt2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats going on in his head?	i went out with my boyfriend for roughly six months.   we finished because i told him i loved him and he said that   he didn's want the pressure of my feelings.   within two weeks he started texting me and in the space   of two days i recieved over 200 messages!   now that he's got me back he says he never wants to   make the mistake of letting me go again and realises   what an idiot he's been.   the problem is i still feel all these feelings that i felt beofore.   i told him and he told me that i made him rly happy and theres no one else he would rather be with.   i belive what he says but i don't want to get hurt. do you think he will love me in time? (so far, second time round we have been going out two weeks and everythings going really good) he seems more bothered about me and him now than he ever was.

20061202155911AARzAlT	Family & Relationships;Friends	One of my best friends?	Ok, a few people from my year in school went on a 3-day trip (including me), and my best boy friend went too, and then on the second night me and my friend were playing a game, and he took me to a really dark spot where nobody could see you, we were on our own, and we hugged and I asked if we were friends (someone said he hated me) and he said 'yeah', and on the same night, I hugged another boy (i hug a lot of friends) and he seemingly got jealous and asked me to hug him. Me, being... well, me I did, and we hugged for about 5-10 seconds before we stopped.       But another thing about the way he's been acting lately is that he's been teasing me, but yesterday he was being really nice to me, even saying he'd shout at this person who bullied me. So now I'm confused. Does he like me or not?

My fiance and I were together for 4 years and then all of the sudden he became cold and stand offish- to make a long story short- we ended things and i began to live the single life. It took a while though for me to get out there and have fun. But i did. I had never been with anyone else before my fiance was my first everything. So i had a fling. Just a one time thing with a guy I knew and it meant nothing. I just wanted to experience that. I was safe (condom) not to mention it lasted a whole 2.5 seconds. Moving on- my fiance wants to work things out now and I'm a little nervous about the sex side of it. I don't want to tell him i was with anyone else because it would hurt him too bad- but then again- he let me go- he wanted me gone- so i gave him what he asked for. Now he wants to work things out and we all now how making up can be- we ended up making up- hot n heavy- im worried about STD's. I was safe with the guy, nothing broke and it was in for 2 sec- let me know your thoughts.

20090305123404AAmjgku	Family & Relationships;Weddings	NRI Doctor in Dubai????	I wanted to know that if I have trained in the US as a doctor, and after that move to Dubai and practice as a doctor there (American-Board Certified Doctors are highly regarded, respected, and well paid in Dubai) would marriage to an Indian girl from India become much more difficult? I know, that a lot of girls are attracted to coming to the United States and marrying an NRI doctor, but if I say that I plan to move to Dubai after finishing my training, are people going to be less interested.... Or would these girls in India, who are attracted to America attracted be equally attracted to Dubai?      I felt Dubai would be a better place to raise family as it is modern, safe, yet very Indian with majority of population being Indian... and it is very close to India so getting to India would not be a problem at all. The only problem is that.... Its not America.      Would most people in India prefer to live in America or Dubai?      I am young (mid twenties), Punjabi, 5 ft 10, surfer, fun loving, and it is going to be my first marriage
20090305123521AApq0AB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If your husband stayed up every night and was on the computer?	but erased all history on it, would you be suspicious, or just not care?   I know that in the past before we were married he looked at porn. I never said anything because I thought it was harmless I guess.  I joke with him about looking at it and he jokes around back with me that he would never do that. Even though I know he has. Anyway, the past few months I've noticed that he's on the computer at night, but erases everything. I never say anything because I don't want to start a fight, we have a good relationship and I don't want to make a big deal about it. But at the same time, I feel hurt, whats so bad that you don't want me to know your looking at it?    Anyway, should I just let it go?

20060615142721AAOPiyZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies need your help!?	Ok so this girl of mine, we've went out on dates and stuff and seem to be into each other. She just got out of a relationship in janurary but it was a short relationship, last year she was cheated on by her b/f and her best friend that she's known all her life and it hurt her. Well every since then when i try to get in a relationship with her she says she's not ready because she wants to start out as friends and work up to a relationship. She said she wants to be with me in the future and can see herself with me but she wants to make sure that she's ready for another relationship before she jumps into one so she wants to take it slow and move up to a relationship with me. My question is shouldn't she have been over this by now? Does it sound like she's using this as an excuse? I want to be with this girl but she seems to have trouble getting over what happened to her in the past and seems to think we are going to turn out that way as well. I think we would be great, what should i do?

To clear things up I don't think that he's cheating on me now, but I was curious to see if he tried to get with any other girls when we first started dating. Apparently, I was right to be suspicious. He told a girl that he still had feelings for her (after telling everyone they never really dated) and he tried to talk to another girl once we were official. These are only the things that I found on his sent messages on Facebook. I almost feel bad about looking in his messages, but then again I feel like my actions were validated by what I found, so I just wanted to know others' opinions.

My bestfriend, (he's a guy early 30s, I'm female mid 20s), is very private and doesn't like his privacy invaded.      A few years ago I house-sitted for him and he made me promise not to snoop...but of course I did.  He knows I did, but didn't get too upset about it.      Now I practically live with him, but now I'm more respectful of his things and his privacy.      He's a writer and keeps notebooks laying around the house and I'm sooo tempted to pick up and read some.  I know if I asked he'd read me some, but not all.  He's real critical of his work.      Would you read it while he was gone or would you respect his things?

He has always flirted with me (even when he said he liked these other girls). When he stopped liking these other girls, I flirted a little back - and now he claims he likes me too. But I'm just not sure :S    He tells everyone he likes me, as if he is proud (if ya know what i mean lol). I dunno whether to go out with him or not! Maybe he is just desperate for a girlfriend!! :S   I don't see why though, because he is really popular - with his friends, and all the girls!   Pweeeaze help   x x

20061202161504AANkB05	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does He Like Me?!?	Well, Im not one to ask this sort of thing, but its been bothering me for awhile now.      There's this guy. Hes sweet, hes funny, hes sporty, and hes into my kinda stuff (ie sports, video games. No, he's NOT into girly pink glittery stuff) He's one of my best guy friends. He looks at me in a different way than he looks at other girls (no weird, sick way of putting that intended) And I can see that he always want to tell me something more. He sort of flirts with me, and he acts so nice around me, but he acts sort of different around other girls. Am I just "one of the guys" (I hang out around his guy friends a lot too, and we always end up arm wrestling, or telling stupid jokes) or does he really like me?    It's been bothering me a lot. I need to know.      Thanks

My best friend introduced me to her and I told her I liked her that same night as I'd seen her earlier that day. I got her phone number and chatted with her online that night into the next morning. We talked a few times after that and during one of the conversations she said to me that she was single and that she was looking for someone who would treat her nice. I told her I wanted to be that person and she said *she hopes so too but we should take it slow.* I hear that and I take it exactly for what it means. In another convo she says that she's not sure about a relationship with me *because I'm not rushing into one with her*. She also told me that she told this guy who liked her that she and I spoke and all and that the "guy", who I know was very upset. When I asked her to tell me the guy's name she starts saying how much she doesn't want to have this convo and she needs some time to think. She later told me that she doesn't want a rship with me.

And since then, we've really came to a stage where we were more than friends( but not couples). She is 1 year older than me and therefore moving overseas to study. B4 she left, i asked her out just to meet up but she said she will contact me later since she was bz with Xmas. But since Christmas Eve, i have not seen her or even heard a word from her. She has left somewhere else to study..., i sent her a mail and i even called her on new year asking her to come down from her home. But i couldnt get thru to her phone.

20070423163924AAq8TJT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the ladies?	Everyone knows that way too often girls are drawn to the sort of guys that will end up being jerks and hurt them in the end, and that they'll pass up the really nice guys and give them the "let's be friends" treatement.        But is the reverse true?  Are there girls out there who are just waiting for some guy to love?  Are there girls who get pissed off knowing they are being passed up for the stereotypical "hot" girl when they are much more worthy of being with.

The girl sends him text messages so he can't be sure where she really is but he doesn't answer but will wait and read her messages. They are real friends not just IM friends. The girl gave him drama but he always told her he could never be angry at her. What do you think? When he came online he always asked her Where are you?

20061220114053AAtdNQ7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	For those who have divorced and have remarried and have kids, but i would appreciate anyone elses opinion.?	my dad divorced my mother when i was young. they only had maybe a five year marriage. my dad has since remarried and has been married to this woman longer than my mother. it seems like when i call my dad he always dumps on me about how he thinks my mother should apologize to him etc for doing what she did to him. I haven't seen my mother in 12 years. At this point I'm so tired of hearing him complain about his pain since they have both moved on. Anyways, my question I want to know is it ridiculous for me to expect him to move on and not be angry with her? thisi affects his everday life and it's been 21 years since they have divorced. it's really starting to get to me, because all of these years he has made it about him and lashed out on me since i look just like her, but he has prevented us from seeing each other when she finally did come back, but he realizes he is wrong.

20070227124259AAIEB2t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can we go about taking things slow?	So I'm dating this guy... I'd say we've been officially dating for almost two months now seen e/other and hung out 6 times. We talked and liked e/other when I had a bf couldnt do anything at that time cause i had a bf but as soon we split we started dating. He was at my house this past wkend and we started listening to music and cuddling which led to our first kiss.Well things got a little hot and hands started wandering and we were both so into it. I however decided to stop before things got too far. Hes a very passionate kisser and his touch is amazing. I already told him I'm not trying to go too far yet but how do I make it easier done than said? I would actually like to wait till May or June.

20070306095935AAVlgMZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I try and talk to him???	So me and my ex broke up about two months ago. He said half of him still loved me but half just wanted to be friends and I was like fine lets break up then. I know where I'm not wanted. But he said we would still be friends. And we were for the next few days but then he told me something that really upset me, that he knew before Christmas break that we weren't going to work. Well two weeks before Christmas break was the first and only time doing things together. And yet he told me even during and after Christmas break that he still loved me. He basically used me. Two weeks after he got what he wanted he knew "us" wasn't meant to be. It was both of our first time we are both in high school. After I told him he used me he got really upset. I told him I was sorry and shouldn't have told him that but that it is what I think happened. Since then he doesnt look at me, or talk to me unless I ask him a direct question. Should I try and talk to him to ask him if thats why he won't be my friend?

But anyways, today in class we were watching a movie and I had my head down while I was watching it, and he pulled a chair and leaned on my desk for most of the movie.    The in the next class, this girl that sits next to me said something, and so he was explaining it and she said "yanno what, Idc" (she was kidding) so he turns to me and starts retelling his story. Then he asked me if he had returned a pen he borrowed and I said yes, then he asked to borow another. So a few minutes later, he turns around and smiles. He was selling candy for a club, and asked if I wanted to buy one..but I didn't..So now..it's almost the end of class. He returns the pen and another person returns one of my pens and he said "Alot of people borrow pens from you, you're like an angel." Then he just loks at me for a second and says "Did it hurt?" lol..I knew--

20061229154147AAPpvF4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Are Asian women the new standard of beauty in America?	I've been notcing recently that Asian women have really been popular with men of all backrounds. I no longer hear men talking about blonds, Latina's, or mixed girls any more, its all about Asian girls now. Why is that? Personally I think its because Asian women tend to be more feminine and have a great combination of beauty and personality. Asian women usually are in good shape where as the majority of women of other races are now obese. Asian women also work hard, age well, are respectful, very cute, appreciative, and carry themselves with class. American women these days are so masculine and nasty, they are basically men.

20070109103103AAhMJcc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it time for me to turn my chase into aloof?	Okay, so there is this girl I have been dating (im 25, she's 24). We've hung out 5 or six times (usually once a week) before then we got to know eachother online alot (I didn't meet her online though). Finally got my first kiss from her (yessss!) on the last one. The only thing is that I can't read her all that well. She tells me that she likes me and is interested, but is pretty low key about it. Understandable, we are still learning about one another. She doesn't give me too much to work with, because she wants to be chased a bit and leave a bit of mystery (it works well). I played the ball into her court a bit, and I'm pretty sure she has the upper hand. Should I turn a little bit more aloof to get her to chase me a bit more? I have to be the one to suggest our plans and ask her to do things (Gosh!). I think I should just become a little unavailable for a little bit. What impact will this have on her interest?

This boy smiles at me like I am everything he has always wanted crambed into one. He practically cried when I said I might have to move. He even got into a fight trying to protect me.

I suffer from depression and I have a 2 yr old child. My husband thinks that I rejected him for the last 2 yrs. He has tried to tell me but in the state of mind I was in I didn't think to much about it. Anyone who deals with this may understand-the medicine and just your state of mind isn't right. You just sit there some times like a bump on a log.  He began to talk to a married girl at work and they really clicked.  He gets attatched easily. They e-mailed and he spoke alot about this problem and how it is killing him and he has had his heart broke all of the time.  Then one day she tried to kiss him. he did stop it and told me about and I did freak out. He told me he would no longer speak to her-LIE. He continued to speak to her and he continued to act strange at home and distant. Then we had a BIG fight about her and the next day he thought we were done and she tried to kiss him again this time he did not stop right away. I love my husband & want things to work but now he won't kiss

In the moment i said i did but confessed to him the next day that i did not. he now wont talk to me and i really miss the friendship. i am so so so sorry about what has happened i have been apologising ever since but still no reply. i courier over a elmo and a heart felt apology letter, (he may be on leave so not sure if he has got it yet.)

20070126004240AA1spWO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it really that hard for a girl to choose between two guys?	There is a girl I met and we became friends.  We never wanted a relationship with each other and were content as friends.        One day we were having lunch and we began to talk, and just at that moment it hit us that we both really liked each other.  We started to spend more time together over the next couple of weeks and our feelings developed.  We had the friendship behind us and got along very well.  Problem is she had a friend in another state that she needed to see if their were feelings between her and him.  She went over New Years to find out if she did or didnt have romantic feelings.  She came back even more confused and says she does not want a relationship with me or him.      We still hang out and I have told her exactly how I feel.  She has trouble telling me her feelings but says she cares for me.  I have never felt for anyone like I do for her and I'm confused as what to do.  Walk away or hang around?  Am I being played?  Is it that hard of a decision for girls to make?

20070208111706AAc6sQN	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you know when people are jealous (hating) on you?	do they talk about you all of the time, are they competitive, are they mean to you, do they backstab you, do they copy off of you, do they try to steal whatever good things you have, do they pick on you, or all of the above? or are most people passive toward the person(s) they are jealous of-meaning do they treat them like they treat everyone else and hide the way that they really feel?  how do people usually act when they are jealous?  how can you tell?

20070214140759AAemfkT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I cope with the pain of ending my most loving relationship?	My friend separated from her husband and filed for divorce.  We fell in love, which was the first time that I have been in love in all my years of dating. I have loved and have been love separately, but I have never really experienced mutual love before. The separation was very tough on my friend and it led to depression. Unavoidably, I have been out of the country while she went through these difficult times. I am still away and have just discovered from her that her heart is very sick, and that medical treatment would be very costly.  She is in a joint medical insurance with her husband, which she will lose if the divorce is finalized. She is left with no other option than to call off the divorce. This has been very devastating news for me.  Can you please suggest best ways of coping with this situation.
20070214150243AAsbIIB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do?	My husband and I have been married for eight years. The last couple of years have been hell on wheels. We have been through infidelty and physical fighting, we argue just about every other day. Recently, my husband was snooping in on a phone conversation between me and my girlfriend and apparently he did not like what he heard. He accused me of cheating and after a heated argument he asked for a divorce. I left the house and returned the next day. But, I met someone knew. Who is very nice. But, now my husband has been nice to me as well and has not mentioned anything about what happened before Valentines Day. I just don't know if I should bring it up about what he asked and let this other guy go. Or kick my husband to the curb. If you were me what should I do. P.S. I am not seeing the other guy. I just had a conversation with him over a friends house which is what me and my friend was talking about over the phone. What would you do?

20070225220710AAEIXjP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any Advice?	I really like one of my guy friends he's 20 years old. We talked about dating but he said that he didn't want to ruin the relationship. Well, he text me everyday to ask how my day is going, how my job going, and looks at me all the time when I see him. We're suppose to be really good friends, but when i ask him to find me a guy to date he tells me hes going to do it but then he don't do it. I have talked to one of his friends, and he tried to get us to date but we didn't want to date, but when it comes to other guys he don't want me to talk to any of homeys. When I even talk about another guy or ask for advice on what should i do, he just pretty much ignore what I say. He won't tell me how he really feels which makes me think there's no feelings there, but when I know he gets jealous over certain things it makes me think he has feelings. Why is he giving mixed signals?
20070227162019AApTzu1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im soo confused about boys-please help?	OK well me and my best friend who is a guy (that I have liked since 5th grade *im in 8th grade*) likes me and I like him. Recently, we had highschool cheerleading tryouts. I had to do a cheer all by myself infront of the whole school and the cheer ended with a split. I was really nervous at the time and I kind of stumbled to the side but still accomplished the split. The immature jerks of guys in my school started up this nasty rumor that I farted when I when down into the split. (the guy I like was absent that day) and so when he came back to school the next day all of those boys told him this and I guess he beleved them because he wont even talk to me. When I try to talk to him he quickly looks away and talks to my best friend. What is going on? It was a stupid immature rumor and I dont know if he will ever talk to me again! I REALLY like him!!! PLEASE HELP!!!

20070302142627AAGdVvp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is he too sexually experienced?	the guy that i am with now is honesly the type of man that i put together in my head. when i imagine a man or build my dream guy i see him. i feel so fortunate to have this type of love but his sexual past bothers me. tell me your honest opinions please. i myself dont have alot of experience but am trying new things now that i am with him.  this is special to me, but i think it is the same ol thing to him. i get upset sometimes and jealous because he seems to enjoy sex and often speaks of his sexual past as if he is reliving these events as we talk about sex. somehow sexual conversations we have turn into him making the conversation a subject in refernece to his sexual past all together. it makes me feel unhappy and unappreciated and i also feel that nothing we do is special. nothing i do is special although it is to me. i think that if he was completely into our sexlife, he wouldnt turn discussions about us into his general sexual experience. am i correct in feeling this way?

Girl in my group at college english class always chats me up in class, always approaches me, laughes really hard at my jokes at all times.

Instead of saying "what are you doing" she says "im going to probbaly go home, i cant afford to eat out with gas." shes complained about financial problems before, so its not some excuse but I still felt shafted and walked of

20070410165310AAqdQBj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I have a crush on this guy?	I have liked him for awhile and he is very sweet when he likes me. He has liked me on and off. We went off once but he told me he wasn't ready for a relationship at the moment. He is in my english class and throught the period I just stare at him. He doesn't talk to me much anymore but that is because I pick on him sometimes. I am going to go camping with him for 5 days and I want to tell him my feelings about him. I want to show him that he means a lot to me and that I want to be more than friends. I am just afraid that he wont feel the same way and my chances of becoming friends with him will be ruined. What should I do to let him know how I feel and if he doesn't feel the same way I could live with being friends?

What does it mean when you are talking to two girls and one says in front of the other girl: 'she fancies you' and giggles?  Are they just being childish or joking? Or is there a reason behind this?

20070424145351AAA50GW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend stuff again...?	ok so like 2 weeks ago i posted a question on here.      Im with a guy that my parents hate. I am 17 and so is he. My parents dont like him because they found out that i loved him and decided to give myself to him. This killed my dad and he hasnt liked him partially because of that. The other thing is that for a long time we fighted about a lot of things. Typical teenage stuff. My parents think that because im smart i need to be above "teenage stuff" and so they pretty much booted him to the curb even though i didnt want to.   My parents said that i couldnt see him and have stuck to that for a while(6 months)But we are still dating kind of in secret. Any ideas on what i can do?
20070426211808AAkLs0c	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I suspect him?	Okay, so things have been going fine between my boyfriend, Charlie, and I until recently. He was talking to one of our classmates, and they ended up in an agrument about this girl he used to like, Vicki. He was all defending her because our classmate, Melanie, was saying that Vicki is a bad editor. Okay, so Vicki is the editor of our school's newspaper, and Melanie is co editor or something. Melanie is mad that Vic changed her layout without telling her. Then Charlie said that Melanie is stupid for talking sh** behind ppl's back, esp. with Vic, since Vic worked SO  HARD ON IT. I was like sitting right there! Why am I suspicious? Well, Charlie used to like me and Vic at the same time, and I never really trust him after I found out that he flirts majorly with her. I forgave him but, he defended  her sooooooooooo passionately right in front of my face!!! What does that mean?! he knows that i get jealous... so why is doing that? Just caught up in the moment cause he never really liked Mel?

He also brings up personal topics aside from work related stuff. People we know in common, etc. I notice that his voice gets softer too. Also, when we speak, he never breaks his gaze - his eye contact is kind of intense.      Should I ask him out? I just hope I dont get rejected.

20070829091401AAiRDjC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long Distance relationship... help!?	I got into a relationship this summer by pure chance with a  great guy, i was reluctant to start dating him and said no the first time, but gave in after a month of hanging out. We saw each other nearly everyday and we both just left for school over the weekend. I didnt think i was this attached but I find myself really sad and crying a lot over it. This is no fun at all. I really miss him, but I'm worried he'll leave me if I confess this to him. I said to him last night that it really sucked and i dont want to hold him back from anything and he said 'yea i know what you mean' and then 'there are a lot of pretty girls here but i dont want to mess this up, if you werent as fun and cool as you were it would be different, and some college girls arent worth messing this potentially really good thing up' im not sure what to take of that. im always his away message end, so hes thinking about me i suppose, and its stated that we're together on the college sites.. should i be worried?

20070712202822AAT9Ja5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone shed some light?	We were supposed to get together to talk tonight. I asked if we could - he had readily suggested tonight. He came in to my office at 4:30 (had made sure he had gotten in before I left) sought me out, made sure he had my number because he has just changed phones and said he would call me after 5. He was smiling and happy. Sounds good right? Except - he never called. That's a lot of work for someone who doesn't want to see me... so I know he wants to spend time with me. But there are these issues of committment that keep rearing their ugly head. Maybe tonight is one of those nights, maybe something happened that he couldn't get out of. The problem is we are only still  just friends and that friendship is only slowly beginning to grow - eve though he has said he loves me. To have these kind of issues so early...does that mean he has real feelings? What does it take to get past this?

My boyfriend who was living with me, left one day with no note and moved back to his home town.  Since I've had no contact with him, I'm having trouble accepting it because I don't understand what were his reasons for leaving.

20090227042241AAZFu7o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it possible to remain in an abusive relationship and maintain happiness and good self-esteem?	One of my good friends has been married for twelve years to a man who has beat her, psychologically terrorized her, and financially exploited her.      My friend claims that "The alternative (leaving) would be worse" because she wouldn't have a place to live.  But she also claims that her husband has the problem, not her, so therefore she is happy in herself and still has high self-esteem.  Otherwords, she "doesn't let him bring me down."      I hate to play the devil's advocate, but if she really thought highly of herself, why would she tolerate her husband's behavior?  Is it possible to remain in an abusive relationship and be happy?      **Please, no "she must like it cr*p" from anyone.  Trust me, she does not like it.**

Poco despues le dije que continuaramos, a lo cual me dijo que ya estaba muy cansada, pero le contesté que podiamos seguirle, cuando empecé a querer metérselo pues mi pajarito ya no quiso despertar con nada, parecia carro chrysler descompuesto, no quiso prender.    Pues nos fuimos a comer, cuando ya estabamos comiendo, que despierta el méndigo pajaro, me dio tanta rabia que le di una cachetada.
20070702171650AA1QUdZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it all in my head?	I always thought this guy in one of my classes was cute. He seemed very shy so him and I never really talked. He once asked me if I needed help carrying a chair down the stairs. Anyway, after the summer I would always see him around school and I would always feel as if he was looking at me. One time I was on the bus and heard him and some girl (im assuming he was seeing her at the time) talking and then when I got up it was dead silent on the bus and I felt as if they were staring at me. Maybe he was staring and she was mad? So yeah is it all in my head or does this guy like me? He was single after and I still felt like he was looking at me. I just don't want to go up and ask him and feel like a moron if I'm wrong.
20070709232943AAEMpB9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I apprach this super-hot guy?	I've liked this guy for a long time. He's real hot. I've never spoken to him, but I know his name, address, car he drives, and sport he plays. Did I mention he's really hot? I don't really "stalk" him, I just casually walk on the sidewalk in front of his house a lot, it's not far from my school. Hey, i like walking: i get a tan, i get some exercise, and i get to look at him. Sometimes he's out there with his mommy doing garden work, and he smiles at me and my friend. I wanna talk to him, but he's kinda intimidating, and usually I only spit game at ugly guys, ones I'm not really interested in. It's easier to talk to ugly guys. But I like this one. Sometimes I watch him practise his sport too-there's a little trail that goes by the field/court thing and i can get a real good view. How should I approach him? I notice he has no window coverings and leaves his window open a lot... should I hop right in? Or would that be too much? (ps we're 19 and 20)
20070715111155AAycSZ5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I blow it with him?	OK, I've gone on 2 dates with this guy and they were awesome, we have only kissed so far. Our Daughters go to the same school and play together, so we see each other often.  I was waiting to pick up my Daughter from camp and her bus was late so I had time to kill. I found out there was a basketball game in the gym so I went to watch and kill time. I look at the players (girls) and I see his Daughters, then remembered he told me that had a game Sat. So I turn to my right and see him.  I sent him a text that said "LOL! Look to ur left." And watched him turn and see me.  He smiled, but looked suprised or irritated, or both still not sure.  I went over and sat next to him and to say hi and talk to him.  We talked about the game, my Daughter's camp, etc. I jokingly said "I'm not stalking you, I'm waiting for Rachelle to get back from camp, but her bus is late."  The game ended and I said I had to go, but don't remember saying goodbye. I felt like a fool and wonder if I blew it with him. ??

20090227035604AAHDg85	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend of 1 year cheated on me?	I kind of knew that he was nosing around. I never really took it seriously, because he had that type of attitude.       I'm very angry because yesterday I found out that he had cheated on me, on more then 5 occasions.       When I actually found out that he was cheating, I saw his Myspace page. It had a girl, in year 8, saying "I love you" and "I loved hugging you yesterday...Your so hot!"       I was amazed. He is in grade 10, and that girl is in grade 8.    Our school only goes from year 7, to grade 10.       That's practically pedophile in my school.      I'm thinking of making up rumors saying that I lost my virginity to his best friend, (I'm not a slut, I'm still a virgin) - to really hurt him.      Or going out with his best friend. Or doing something along those lines.      Please help, I'm so angry right now.

He's from the UK as an international student at my school in California.  Since he's been here he has become a huge part of my life (lived at my house during christmas break with my family, we live together now in our own place, and he is friends with most of my friends).  Well, he and I both are on facebook and he get's messages and notes from people from his home. One of them is a girl who sounds really fun and like I think I would get along with her. Now I should have asked before hand but I messaged her today and we are getting along very well via email. I should have asked but I knew he was going to say no. Well, I told him that it had gone over well and now he is really mad at me and thinks it was completely unappropriate. If you have to scold me in your answer, please be nice, I already feel terrible.

I think its because the other day she seemed like she wanted to talk to me, but i had to leave, so i couldnt, so i think that is y she is mad at me. But i dont think she really likes me like a bf just like a friend she talks to sometimes, so im not sure y she would care then. do u think she might like me, or is it something else?

20090227042140AAWkQcH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I worry about my fiance and her myspace?	She doesn't get on it much but she always has messages never comments. I brought up the issues, via text mind you, If she would be willing to give me her myspace information. Due to previous events I have wondered if she has had something to hide but never anything very crucial i guess. Sometimes I have wondered if she was talking to someone else but brushed it off. Anyways she said she would but she's afraid I would talk to other people posing as her. She follows this text with Would I give my stuff to her ((as if I wouldn't)) So I immediantly gave her the info. Only to get a reply saying. Wow ok it was just a suspicion. I ask her if my point was proven that I have nothing to hide. Then she quits texting. Maybe she went to sleep? maybe she didn't want to give the info? She didn't get on myspace... Anyways opinions? views? comments?

20090227042847AAH2Bdr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	WIFE TEENAGE BOYFRIEND THE BEST LIAR?	For 30 years i been searching for you. I just want to tell you how sorry I am for not coming back to marry you. We were then 17 years old and due to circumstances, we separated. I promised myself that I will only come back to you when I succeed. And I will never die with my eyes closed if I do not tell you how sorry I am for leaving you. I cried for 3 days and nights just thinking of you and I needed you so much. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, this is a true story of a man who lost his so-called lover 30 years ago and finally found her last year in April 2008. Obviously they were overjoyed to recall old times, which is definitely alright if they met decently, with respects to their partners. Bear in mind, the man was my wife's former teenage lover and I think he is really good with his words and my wife taken in by all this " " " ". Would you believe any of these words? have you ever come across such a sentimental guy who would keep his love for his teenage gf even after he is happily married to a very supportive wife? And told his former teenage gf that he married his wife out of convenient sake and there's practically no love at all between them? Frankly, I get very sick even describing all these to you readers. What you think? What would you do?

Our sexual life is very satisfactory, though we can't find new positions for love making due to our heights differences. We are trying some new things now a days, so can anyone tell me about a web page where I could find some useful information for us? or any suggestions of couples like us about other than missionary, doggy and me on top?...sorry if this is too explicit but I wish that only mature adults will answer.

20090227043646AAbNGS9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP>  WHY NO SOCIAL LIFE?	I am a junior in college and also work part time.  I live on campus and I have no social life.  I am very confidented that I am attractive but my confidence level in communicating with females is low.  I've never been the type to approach a female to get her number, but I do believe in trying to become friends with a female.   Tonight, I went to the movie theaters(by myself) to see Friday 13th.  THere were only three other people in to see this movie who took a seat in front of me.  They happen to be student at the same University that I go to.  We had a little conversation and I went to get popcorn and they ask to bring them some back, jokingly.  Long story short, I asked for their information after the movie and they gave me a number but no name and then left out.  I later texted the number and found out that they gave me a number to a guys phone.  I'm feeling a little down right now because I have no social life and it seems like no matter what I do to try obtain one, it never works.  I try to go to parties, but even at parties i dont know how to behave.  I walk around, not knowing if I should ask a girl to dance or just walk behind someone whos dancing and start dancing with them.           I'm starting to feel really unattractive.      My confidence in obtaining relationships and friendships are decreasing.       Though it sounds vain, I'm tempted to place pictures of my muscles and body on facebook and myspace like other guys on campus do that get response.  But what do you suggest for me to do?  Would you change anything that I do?

20090227043714AAo2nCx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Im still in Love with my ExGirlfriend & I want her to come back to me for good instead of coming & going.?	We dated 2 years and she broke up with me right after Halloween. She said that she just wanted to be single for a while because she was tired of being tied down and everytime she does something with her mama I would call to much... I just kept checking on to make sure they was ok and how long it would be before she was coming over.. I mean from the 1st day we started dating we only went no more than 4 days without seeing each other the whole 2 years we dated... Well besides the last week or 2 we dated.. She wouldnt come to the house as much and I could just tell by the way she was acting & the sound of her voice that something wasnt right so I asked her what was wrong. She said that she just wanted to have sometime to herself for a while, she was tired of being tied down. She is 19 and I am 23. I know she is young and doesnt want to getting married right now hell I Dont want to get married right now. But About 2 monthes ago she started dating some guy she met. Well Valentines Day she called me and asked me what I Was doing and if she could come to my house bc she was upset bc her and her new bf got into a fight bout something. Well of course I said yeah I would be happy for her to come bc I hadnt seen her in about a month. The last time I saw her was when they had just started dating. They had been dating for like a month when she come to my house to get some of her stuff, Some of it, she didnt get all of it and she still hasnt brought me none of my stuff from her house... Well we ended up having sex and after that we kind of started texting each other a lil more than we had the past month. Well Valentines Day she come to my house that night around 9 bc she got into a fight with her bf about something. She told me that all he wanted to do was what he wanted to do. He never did anything she wanted to do. He has never took her out to eat or to a movie. The only place he has took her is fast food joints. All he got her for V-day was a $1.59 rose from a Gas Station... He has a job and all so he makes money hes just selfesh. She told me that she thinks he is playing her, only with her for one thing but she doesnt want to believe it bc she said some days Hes straight but most days hes an asshole and all he wants to do is sit on his *** & smoke weed. She is the type of person that is active. She loves outdoors... She asked him the other day just to walk through the woods to see what they could find bc its an old farm where he lives and he said No I dont feel like it.. He never wants to do anything she wants to do.. I asked her if he made her happy and she said No... I said well why are you with him she said" I dont know im stupid I guess" her exact words.... Well this past week and a half we have seen each other a good bit. We spent time together Valentines day night, the next day and she even stayed with me Monday night. She come to my house that tuesday after I got off of work and we rode around for like 3 hours just talking... She was talking like she did when we was dating... Like planning stuff for us to do and talked about us getting married and having kids..... Hell I thought she was coming back bc she told me and her friends that she was about to break up with him bc she was tired of his crap.. well that was 4 days ago and she still hasnt broke up with him... Last Weds we planned on going to the movies and out to eat and then we was gonna drink a few... My family was having a cookout that sunday and she was like I wanna go, I was like ok thats fine... Well that thursday when I got home after work I called her and said what u doing she said nothing im with Chris, her Bf... I was like oh ok so I take it your not coming to my house tonight and she said yeah in a few hours... Well she text me like 2 hours after I called her and told me that she was really sorry for not coming to my house like she said she was gonna do.... Well the next day she text me and asked me if I was at work I said yeah.. We text a few time back n forth and then I asked her if she was coming to my house that night... Well a few mins went by no response... So Bout 20 mins later I sent it again... Still no response so about an hour after I sent it I said Nevermind.... Well we didnt talk for 4 days and then 2 nights ago she come to my house bc they had got into a fight... I told her when she got there that I missed her alot and she said I Miss you to and I said no you dont she said.. Im Here Aint I... Everytime she has come to my house besides 2 nights ago we have had sex.... They dont tell each other I Love You or anything like when they get off the phone...

My husband and i just got married a little over a month ago and we are already having problems. 1-i want sex more than he does. 2-i want more emotionally than hes giving. 3- i cant make him understand what i need. 4-he wont tell me what he needs. I've been reading different things online trying to get some ideas on what i can/should do. One option was basically playing mind games. Back off and make him think that you have more important things to do or that you are an independant woman that can make herself happy without him. Which is fine but i dont want to play mind games. I want him to understand what i want so he wont feel so horrible and get so mad at me when i try to explain or ask him for things. one problem we have is that he is a nurse and works at nite and is a night person and i need my 8 hrs before work. i cant fall asleep without him and i'm trying to get use to the fact that i have to fall asleep without him but...

20070619155323AAun6dr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I go? How can I turn this in my favor?	I like this girl, and we're great friends. We've been great friends for a long time. Recently I've begun to like her as more as a friend. She knows this, but she also recently started dating someone else (before she found out I liked her as more than friends). Yeah it sucks.       So now she's going to be bringing him to a mutual friend's birthday party. I've also been invited by the mutual friend. Well now I don't even want to go to the party. She asked me if things would be weird. I told her no, it wont be weird, even if it is, it's my problem to deal with and not hers- so for her not to worry about how I feel. I also told her I'm jealous.(which I am)       Truth is, it'll be extremely weird  for me and I'll just leave the party alone and depressed.       I'm just wondering if you guys think it's even worth going. Not just that, but is there any way to turn the situation in my favor? Thanks folks.

20070628204101AAFciwS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I have a problem attracting black women? Or getting them to notice me?	I thought I would ask here because I have known a few women I would really like to get to know better. I have talked to them a few times and have alot in common but cant seem to get anything other than a friend vibe. I asked one of these women out for a date once and she laughed and said "you white boys are stiff, someone needs to put you on point" I don't know what that meant. Since I was unsure if it was an insult I did not ask. I have never seen a black woman date a white man, is there some issue I don't know about, or are most not attracted to white guys?

20070705200855AAJM5Ow	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My son  (16) & I have a very unique bond, we talk openly about everything!  Sex, Drugs etc etc.  ok or wrong?	My Son and I talk OPENLY about everything that happens in our lives,  I'm 44, he's 16,  we have always had a very special close bond, some people think we talk openly about too many subjects, but I think, that is good, so we can have an open honest communication with eachother...   I have 3 kids, and I've never been married, as I don't believe in marriage,  but I wanted kids and I have got 3 Great kids,  he is my only son, and we have our disagreements, we choose our battles and our wars, but we always come out of our wars closer than before,  we talk openly about sex, drugs, yes, every subject we can talk openly about....    my  younger bf came over after work, he's 28, my son met him for the first time, and he's cool with it,  he knows his mom is a Horny, and I LOVE Sex!   Why do some people think it is wrong for him and I to have open discussions?  It is better to know what is going on, than not to know..... I keep a good supply of condoms on hand, for the both of us... It's okay!

20070708133013AAh3N1B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a guy be too perfect and it's a turnoff to girls?	I was wondering this if its true.      Are girls turned off if a guy is too perfect. I mean nobody is perfect, but like has a lot going for, etc..       I just dated a girl, and after about three weeks she told me that we should't see each other anymore cause she felt just so insecure dating me cause she felt I could have any girl that I wanted and would just leave her. This happened to me once before as well. Just about me: I graduated from an ivy league school, speak 3 foreign languages, work at a top wall street firm. I have also been told I am very attractive, and of course have a very friendly personality. I do not think I am cocky at all, and no one has every told I come across that way. So this girl basically told me that she feels like I would just walk away from her at a whim for a "better girl". Is this true, and if so what can I do to stop this?
20070708214555AA22QL1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl question i need help?	There is a girl that I’m attracted to and she told me she is very attracted, to the point she has vivid dreams about me and can't stop thinking about me. she said there has been times where we would be sitting next to each other and all she could think of is me kissing her(i didn't kiss her, it was a thought in her mind).The only problem is she has a bf and a child with him (the child isn't the problem). She told me that she loves still loves him, but she said, she isn't attracted to him anymore, they don't talk anymore and have nothing in common. she doesn't spend anytime with eachother, because of having nothing in common and nothing to talk about. I don't want to be a home wrecker. We hang out and have lots of fun together, and we talk a lot. we have a lot in common and we can talk about anything. She is a good friend too. I have not told her how i feel about her. i want to, but i don't wan to make it any more though for her. what should i do?
20070709233916AAUf62g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, can you date a girl for 2+ years and claim that you never loved her?	My boyfriend dumped me out of the blue after almost two and a half years together. He was a wonderful guy who always wrote multiple poems about how much he liked me, left me cute notes, and constantly told me that he loved me. We were like childhood best friends together, always playing silly and goofy kid games, making fun of each other, and laughing. He is now going off to school to become a youth minister and claims that he never loved me like a girlfriend, just a sister/best friend, and that he only went out with me because he thought I was funny and attractive, but he never liked me like a girlfriend. I find this hard and very confusing to believe. He has been the closest, best friend I have ever had, and it leaves me heart broken that he says he never loved me. Guys, is this rational, or is he just going through a weird phase?

20070809142918AA91LN5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Writing on the wall?	Girlfriend of 5 months said she loved me after 2 months, but it was only to me in private. She has never said it to me in front of her two young kids since she "didn't want to confuse them" b/c she is not finished her divorce yet. She said her kids seeing us kiss and sleeping in the same bed together is good enough and I disagree. I think it would confuse the kids less if they heard her say it since otherwise she is just sleeping in the same bed with an arbitrary guy and not with someone she loves. Anyway, two months ago she said she needed space and was specific in how - so I gave her that space. She has not said she loves me over these past two months since the time she requested space. (I have not said it either over the past two months). She still rarely makes comments like "we'll have to do that in December" and references to future things but nothing major and these confuse me. Does a woman ever come back loving stronger after needing more space and getting it? Or are things over

Je meurs d'envie (malgré ma grande timidité)de reprendre contact avec elle pour lui proposer de boire un verre tous les 2       Est ce que vous le feriez vous ? Ca ne vous choquerai pas qu'une personne ne vous connaissant que tres peu vous propose ca ?   La meilleure facon : le mail ou le telephone ?      Merci pour vos avis

20081109091927AANmPQN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whys he so rude even though he knows that i like him?	theres a senior on my swim team that i have liked since the beginning of the school year. his names nick and he knows that i like him a lot because of one of my loud mouthed friends. im a sophomore btw.   alot of his friends and the guys he hang out with like me for some wierd reason but he wont even talk to me. yesterday was regionals for swimming and i did really good in one of my races, i got my best time by a lot. everyone on my team ran and gave me a huge hug after my race , except for him. i walked by him and smiled and he just stared at me and looked away. i dont think the problem is that im ugly or fat (im 5 9 and 130 lbs) and heres my picture.  http://s332.photobucket.com/albums/m329/...    i started crying at the swim meet because i told him good job after his race and he barely even looked at me and murmered 'thanks'.    hes very very hot and i see him staring at me a lot but i dont know if its just b/c he thinks im staring at him a lot (which i do kinda b/c i really like him but i try not too). everyone says hes pretty shy around girls but idk.    ive basicaly given up in getting him to like me b/c i know he doesnt like me but i just dont know why! im not loud or mean and im nice to everyone and im smart in school. why is he so compelled to be mean when he knows that it must hurt me b/c i like him so much?

20081014163102AAIF9L6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've always been there for him, should i stop?	I've known this guy for going on 5 years. we live on complete opposite sides of the country, but through it all, i've always been there for him. this past year we became very close, we were together for a while, him flying here, then me flying out to visit him...but we found out that a girl he had a one-nighter with is now pregnant and claiming him to be the father. for a while, we wernt talking because of issues my family had with him, and drama along those lines. Hes currently in iraq, and has been since July, we began talking again in late july, and i've sent him 2 care packages since his deployment. after both packages, i recieved emails thanking me for the little goodies i put in the boxes. But it seems to me that though before we found out about the baby, we had talked about getting married and such, now, (though hes decided not to be with the babys mother), he doesnt seem to have the same interest he used to. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesnt. i havent talked to him in about 3 weeks or so, but when we were able to talk, he would tell me how much he misses me, and cant wait for us to be together...and so on and so forth. What i guess is confusing me the most is that he calls his parents (duh), but also calls his ex-fiance, but i guess cant seem to find the time to call me? He ended things with his ex, and his mother (whom i talk to pretty much every day) reassured me that theres nothing going on between them, but it still makes me wonder WHY hes not trying to contact me. I emailed him about a week ago, and know for a fact that hes read the email, and replied to other peoples, but not yet replied to mine. all in all, i guess my question here is that since i've been there for him through all of his military career, and sent him numerous christmas, easter, and birthday boxes, should i still send him the little halloween box i made up for him? its nothing big, i got him a pumpkin halloween bag and filled it with candy. but im torn between sending it, and seeming like im trying to push things between us, or seeming almost desperate... or not sending it, and feeling bad that i missed a "holiday".         some insight here?
20080305101543AAFCbIG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Moving across country for a guy?	4 years ago, i was on a cruise, and met this absolutly amazing guy. he lives in new york, i live in chicago. hes 5 years older than me, and thats why we've had a hard time having a title for our relationship. we're not "together" because of the fact that im still a minor and in highschool. theres been alot thats happened between us. i havent seen him since the cruise, but ive talked to him ever since. hes a wonderful guy with a good head on his shoulders. hes in the military, and right now working on opening his own buisness. in the past four years, we've had our on and off times, and for a while, i thought it was because he didnt feel the way i felt about him. but in more recent months, we've been talking more, and ive really been able to get a sense of who he is. he works about 100hrs a week, so hes really busy, and we dont get to talk as much as we'd like, but when we get a chance to, we do.
20081116193929AAgP52C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it strange that I, as a guy, never want to have oral sex?	I know it's not something everyone wants to talk about. If you're grossed out or offended by this, just don't read or answer. I don't know about all of you but I don't think I ever want to have oral sex. First of all, it's pretty gross. After all, pee comes out of there. It's also kind of slutty and I don't want to think of the woman I spend my life with in that type of way. I just don't really feel comfortable with it. I notice that I'm not like a lot of guys I know. They can talk about their experiences with it openly and act like they just won an award or something. I sat next to this one druggie in high school in history class and I was disgusted when he was talking about how he got head the other night. It's just not something I want to do, giving or receiving. Apparently a lot of men like it and the women who don't like it anyways because they want to 'please' their man. Do you think it's weird that I don't like it?

20080430131753AArX7Ak	Family & Relationships;Family	Comment faire?	Ma grande soeur (40 ans bient?t) est celibataire et a la garde de son fils de 7 ans. Elle a un sale caractère et se vexe pour un rien, d'ailleurs elle vient de quitter la maison de mes parents (qui la logeaient depuis sa dernière rupture) sur un coup de gueule, entrainant son fils avec elle. Elle n'a pas de boul?t et a un besoin affectif immense car seule elle est perdue et tombe dans la depression. Je me demande d'ailleurs si elle n'est pas bipolaire.    Je voudrais l'aider mais elle fuit dès qu'on veut lui parler ou la mettre devant ses responsabilités. Je voudrais lui dire que tout ?a va mal finir, qu'elle se met en danger ainsi que son fils mais quand j'ai commencé à lui en parler la semaine dernière elle a fuit et on n'a plus de nouvelles. Je ne vais quand meme pas faire un signalement à dass. Mes parents se demandent s'il ne faut pas la mettre sous tutelle.   Je crois qu'il n'y a pas vraiment de solution mais s'il arrive un malheur, je m'en voudrais bcp.

20081119094644AAeMJmD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just prefer younger women, so why is that such a problem for older ladies to deal with?	I am a 45 year old guy and a little over a year ago I split from my long term girlfriend who was 42 at the time. In the past year I have dated women as young as 23 and as old as 50 and I have to say that now that I'm looking to settle down again into a long term relationship that women past the age of 40 just don't do it for me. Something about their skin changes and often, especially if they are mothers the spark just seems to have gone out of them and sex with younger childless women is just so much better as well.   I have decided to go after women age 35 or younger.    A woman of 41 who I had dated a few times wanted to know why I didn't want to take things further with her and rather than give her the usual BS I told her straight that she was too old for me. She was furious and has been bad mouthing me all over the place ever since saying I'm totally shallow and so on. Some guys have said you can't dismiss a woman on account of her age but most guys know what I mean. Anyway regardless of her campaign against me I am now dating a lovely 31 year old.       Now I'm not saying that all women over 40 are washed up and some men may be happy with them but for me I need something with a little less wear and tear. Its all down to personal choice so whats the harm in going after what you really want?

20070521005123AAnSEPf	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I suspecting or is it happening to him?	Im 18 and my brother is 21 and we are very close to each other. Yesterday afternoon he came home after a big soccer match and told me about his team's victory. I congratulated him and after lunch I slept on the couch and asked him to massage my feet as usual. He sat at the rear of the couch as usual and took my feet and started massaging softly and talked about the match and all his achievements in it. My feet was resting on his lap as usual but i felt something was hard over there and just looked at his lap area and I saw a big bulge over there!!!...it was unusual for him to erect when he massages my feet but this time it was bulged.

Pour apprendre la valeur d'un mois, demande à la mère qui a mis un enfant au monde trop t?t.      Pour apprendre la valeur d'une semaine, demande à l'éditeur d'un journal hebdomadaire.        Pour apprendre la valeur d'une heure, demande aux fiancés qui attendent de se revoir.        Pour apprendre la valeur d'une minute, demande à celui qui a raté son train, son bus ou son avion.        Pour apprendre la valeur d'une seconde, demande à celui qui a perdu quelqu'un dans un accident.        Pour apprendre la valeur d'une milliseconde, demande à celui qui a gagné une médaille d'argent aux Jeux Olympiques.        Le temps n'attend personne.    Rassemble chaque instant qu'il te reste et il sera de grande valeur. Partage-les avec une personne de choix et ils deviendront encore plus précieux.        La source de ce poème est inconnue

J’aimerais semer tant de fleurs en vos jardins,   Que l’on s’y promène… Souhaitiez-vous prendre ma main !

Mon doux rêve est-il fou ? ou rêvé-je ma folie ?   Deux rivières différentes s’écoulant d’un même lit,   Heureuses de nourrir leurs terres fertiles et tendres,   Et qu’un être bienveillant aime les comprendre…      très douce journée à vous !      p.s. : j'espère que mes poèmes, déjà, ne suscitent pas votre ennui...

Nos terres br?lées, aux ocres, couleurs de Sienne,   Rena?tront des crues, limons de tous nos chagrins…      Au bout de mes doigts, je veux ta peau qui palpite,   Veuilles-tu, dans mes bras, seulement trembler de joie,   Que mon regard flambe dans tes yeux qui crépitent,   Prends ma main, fort, sourions de croiser nos doigts…         belle journée à vous...

20080321053943AAcm35O	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is that they courts won't enforce my ex-wife to pay her child support?	She is a year behind. Never paid a penny. I have been to the DA for Non-support. Its been over 6 months since I have been to them. I have had 3 court appearances for this and she has not shown up for either.       Now, I have had others even women tell me they are not going to do anything because she is the mother. They have even said to me that if it was me (the father) that had to pay I would have been picked up by now for not paying.       I believe in our justice system. I try not to play the if it was me or its because she is the mother.       I know there are many deadbeats out there fathers and mothers alike. I do not depend on child support to live off of but would like to have the extras for the kids. Because of her our budget is extremely tight.       What is your opinion about mother having to pay child support but refusing to do so? Or the courts doing very little if any anything about deadbeats?

On s'aimait tellement qu'on s'est pascé au bout de 2 ans et demie. Mais le PACS à tout changé chez lui car il est devenu stressé par la peur que ses parents découvre notre "mariage". De ce fait, il est devenu invivable, agressif et donc, on a rompu le PACS au bout de 8 mois. Il m'a demandé à ce qu'on se sépare car il veut" être célibataire". Deux mois aprés, il m'a demandé de le rejoindre ( autre pays, autre langue) mais refuse que l'on vive ensemble, qu'on soit de nouveau ensemble et de dire à ses Amis et à sa famille que je suis avec lui.   Mon probléme est que tous les jours il vient chez moi , continu à  coucher avec moi, m'invite à toutes ses sorties mais refuse catégoriquement de dire qu'il est avec moi, qu'il me voit et suis dans la même ville, car "nous ne sommes que de simple Ami".

She recently was diagnosed with Bipolar.  The prblem is that ever since I have known her she is always goign to the hospital for drugs.  I haven't talked to her in a couple of months well at least not person to person and everytime she asks for a ride to the hospital I tell her I can't and make up an excuse.  I don't have time to sit around in a hospital to wait for them to tell her she is fine.  I know she just goes for the drugs and that is also part of the reason that I don't take her.  She calls me during the middle of my classes and knows I can't leave them.  I knwo she just wants to drag me down with her, she has even said that she is jealous of her brother because he is doing so well.  Last time I tried to call her some one answered the phone and hung up on me three times so I decided nto to call back.  I have bee trying to tell her if she wants to talk...

20080620063552AAK85pi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do you hope to get out of life? What does life mean to you personally?	I hope to be remembered as someone who cared and tried to make a difference in a small way. The only things I want to get out life are the chance to see the joy in a child's eyes at Christmas, or to watch a crippled child take their first steps and see the smile on their face, or to watch a Special Olympian cross the finish line and not worry wether they won or not. These things can't be measured by gold or power. They can't be bought. They must be lived. That to me is life, and a life worth living.
20081029103129AAs6UEv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I suck in bed, how can i make it better. ?	Ok maybe I don't totally suck, but!  my boyfriend just informed that he doesn't dig it when I switch gears when I'm in the Girl On Top position. Here is how he put it       "whenever you switch gears you lose all rhythm it's you're having a seizure or a white guy on a dance floor, we'll be going good for a while and then you just switch it up and I can't get in to it"       Ouch....aside from some hurt feelings, i need to know what to do. I don't want him to always do the work, but I also don't want to look like a fool on top of him

20080501091634AAI5hZP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does behaviour like this mean?	I like this girl and yesterday in class, we seemed to catch eyes a lot, about 10 times in one hour, when i looked over sometimes she was looking at me and quickly looked away, but other times we both appeared to glance at eachother at the same time. she also sat with her body and crossed legs pointed at me.      Could these signs mean that she likes me, thats what it would seem but also could it be that she is not interested or creeped out by me, or worried that i like her when she doesn't like me back      I don't see why she would like me as i am shy and don't say much in class, i have also never spoken to her much except giving eachother a smile when we pass and a 1 hour long conversation on MSN, i am also a bit out of her league,      I also think she is much more attractive than me but i have heard other people say she is fat and that she looks like a rat

I'm decently handsome, my wardrobe is mildly below average in terms of conformity to brand or style but i definately don't look like a hobo. I drive a Subaru Legacy kept in great condition. I have a job working fulltime at a tabacco plant. Yet I can't seem to land a date if my life depended on it. I always get treated by women or women I know in a condescending, "let's just be friend's" way. I initiate the idea of dating women I know and I REGULARLY get brushed off or turned down, all the while being accused of not having the balls to ask. (So why'd I ask in the first place). The point is, every excuse has been used towards me by virtually the same women. Either I'm too forward or too vague, this or that. I'm even getting the impression I'm being sabatoged from them and singled out as non-dating material for ridiculous reasons. My question is... do girls really do this? Just never give someone the time of day to feel better about themselves? Are they really that picky and immature? Hel
20081215110540AAZGCe2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I meet Mormon boys my age?	I'm 14, and I'm homeschooled. I am a Christian, but the boys that I'm around (who are supposedly Christians) are dumb and do stupid things and curse all the time. It really irritates me.      It seems like Mormon people are usually so much more serious about their religion and actually follow what it says instead of doing whatever they want. I would really like to meet some LDS boys that are my age, but I am probably not allowed to go to Mormon church. It's not that I only like Mormons or anything like that, but it seems like they're usually very nice, sweet, and down-to-earth. Would a Mormon even be friends with a non-Mormon Protestant person like me?      If anyone could help I would really appreciate it, and I hope this question doesn't sound superficial or offensive.      Thanks. :)

20080106162209AARG5JZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!!! Is it too soon to be worried in this relationship??	I am 21 yrs old. Ive been seeing a girl for three months (I never met her before this). I asked her after 2 weeks to be my gf and she told me she gets scared because she had a long on and off bad relationship in the past. She told me its hard for her to open up. She did say she liked me and wanted something out of it with me but said she wants to take everything very slow. She said this after about two weeks and Ive been seeing her for three months now and she hasnt brought it up again. It seems like she is not trying nearly as hard in the relationship as me. One day she will call me and text me or ask me to hang out then the next day she will back off and not respond to a call or text for days. Were on Christmas break now (we live far away so we cant see each other for 3 weeks) and she has become distant again and I honestly think that if I just stopped talking to her completely that she wont even make an effort to talk to me. Is it too soon to be worried and is she just scared??

We used to be friends then one day he told me that me and him's more than just bestfriends/super duper bestfriends. So that means he likes me more than besfriends but less than love. One day he asked me to lick his penis otherwise he wont talk to me forever. So I had to accept. And he said that he'll love me. Then It was time, i went to his house and i said do it in the garage, so we went to his garage, he closed the door and turned on the light. I heard this sound, it was made by a zipper. Then I turned to him and said to him, no matter what i wont do it. He said "Come On just once" And then i just realised that he took out his penis and i accidentally saw his penis. So i turned away from him. Then we just broke up just because I didn't lick his penis. He said whenever i lick his penis, will be friends again. So should I lick his penis?

20080129075020AAXdkxb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Y'a-t-il une tra?trise plus bénéfique qu'avoir une ma?tresse?	Ma femme, surtout lorsqu'elle est la mère de mes enfants, c'est un amour complet. C'est tout en un. C'est la c?toyer tout le temps. Ne jamais avoir marre d'elle. C'est vivre en permanence sa joie, son chagrin, sa mauvaise humeur, sa maladie. C'est en un seul mot, une partie de soi-même. Toutefois, une ma?tresse, c'est le pilier essentiel pour que la vie conjugale avec mon adorable femme dure longtemps. La ma?tresse, c'est la rose qui est éclot tout le temps. Elle n'a pas le droit de se laisser aller, ni même de tomber malade. A part ses problèmes financiers, tous les autres problèmes de la vie restent en dehors de la relation. Une ma?tresse c'est la beauté permanente, c'est le parfum le plus attirant, c'est le lit où tout est permis. Une ma?tresse, c'est le défoulement absolu et c'est l'essence qu'on a besoin pour mener à merveille sa vie conjugale à la maison. Néanmoins, une m?tresse après avoir consenti la relation sexuelle, c'est un fardeau qu'on a besoin de s'en débarrasser le plus

At a weekend convention I recently reconnected with a lady I had met about 9 months ago. I think I'm starting to fancy her, but I know my friend does too. She knows we both like her. He knows that I know he likes her, but he doesn't know that I also want to take her out. I think he's had plenty of chances and he hasn't done any thing yet. I asked him for her phone number a few days ago to ask her a completely unrelated to dating question and I told him not to worry cuz that's all I wanted to do. Now I do want to ask her to the movies and I'm pretty sure she wants to go. I don't want my friend to feel betrayed, he's a good friend. I'm worried that she might not like that I asked her out after I told him I only wanted her number to ask her a "just friend question".    If you were him would you be mad?

20080307165345AAjiX9D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I NEED SOME SERIOUS answers!!! This guy's personality TOTALLY Changed!! Can you tell me what happened???	This guy friend came to my house (I've slept w/ him in the past) anyway, at first he would hardly look at me. Then he looked down & I asked him a question. When he looked back up, his eyes & my eyes met. It was like he was frozen. He didn't respond. I asked him again & it was like he was at a loss of words. After that, it was like he couldn't stop looking in my eyes. It was like if the conversation shifted, he would say my name to get me to look back at him. As he was leaving, he got real close to me, looked deep in my eyes, made a flirty remark & turned real quick. Then as he was getting in the truck, he made a joke (about my current b/f) smiled real big & turned quickly to get in the truck. He did all of this in front of my friend. She said it was the weirdiest thing she had ever seen. She said it was like he fell in love with me or something.  she said it was like he was hypnotized. What did I do to make him come on to me like that? Was he hypnotized with my beauty? What happened?

20080311135914AAoQOYP	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm Looking For Info About My Step- Daughter PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!?	Hi. I'm looking for my partners daughter whom he hasnt seen for about 6 years. Her name is Ashleigh Maree Geppert or she may be going by Ashleigh Maree Nicholson now. Her mothers name is sally Ann Nicholson who lives in Cowra NSW AUS last time we heard. Ashleigh lives with her maternal grandparents Gail and Harvey Nicholson in Young NSW AUS. Her birthday is May 4th 2001 and she was born in Young. Her grandparents refuse to let my partner see her  and through the hurt of trying for 2 years for part custody and be denied (because of work reasons) he has given up to save the hurt. If I could perhaphs show him some photo's of her or give him some information about her it might cheer him up a little. We also have a 8 month old son together who I  would like her meet hopefully. She goes to the HENNESSY CATHOLIC COLLEGE in Young and would be in either years 1 or 2. Please help me bring some light back to my partners life. Thank you in advance for anyone who can help!!!

It doesnt bug me at all. But right now I just need some time to get my head straight but after who knows!   We kept talking, than he had to go. My mom was watching my msn when he said: "See you tomorrow(L)"  I didnt think much of it; its an msn heart, big deal. But my mom said he probaly likes me.      I really like him alot, but I dont know if he likes me at all.   How can I know for sure if he likes me or not?

20080331114028AAGKTx9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question about strip clubs?	I just posted about my bf and strip clubs some who answered did not see a question. The question is what really goes on there and is it true that couples really do go there together? and do I have a right to be mad?      His friend invited us to go for his birthday I wanted to go but my bf didn't want me to. I got mad b/c he didn't have a good reason. He said because its not normal for a guy to bring his gf and women to be there besides the dancers. I said Ive heard about women going and if I said I wanted to go, whats the issue, why not just let me?   So i took it as him not wanting me to see what really goes on there. I took it as him planning on being up to no good. I mean what is there to hide, especially if I was invited!!!   Now I'm taking offense and I don't trust him. Now its at the point to if he wants to go I am dumping his a*s with the quickness.   Is this an overreaction? I was thinking if I react this way he may do it behind my back, but thats a risk I'm going to take.
20080401040124AAwn595	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This girl gave up on me or what?	It was Tuesday night and i called her to let her know that i m going to take her to movies, but did not say the day. The same day i talked to her, she told me that on wednesday she has a farwell party. At the end of our conversation, she told me that to call her to let her know. So when wednesday night reaches i did not feel like calling her since i taught she might be in a party and she might be tired. So i waited until Thursday and called her at night. But she did not pick up her phone. I called one more time after waiting 10 minutes but she did not pick up.      I felt like i and her matched and i liked her. I know now that i should have called her wednesday night but i did not want to make her tired talking on the phone.             After this i called her and left message on the phone. on the next day, i got call from her and i asked her if i can take her dinner.  she said i will call you back to let me know.

20080402141956AAlN44P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Girlfriend And Her Ex Boyfriend Issues..?	Hello, a 2-3 weeks ago, my girlfriend (which we have been dating for 3+ years) started once again talking/hanging out with her ex boyfriend.  This ironically started after he broke up with his girlfriend.  Anyways, that past few weeks my girlfriend has been talking to me less and less and to him more and more.  She insists to me that they are just friends, but somewhere deep down I know that she still feels something for him.  I have no problem when she tells me she is hanging out with him, but the other night I caught her in a lie in which she was spending time with him but didn't mention anything about it and even lied to her sister about it.  She said she didn't want to tell me because she knew I get mad when in the past I haven't gotten upset over her spending time with him.  Am I over reacting or is there something more to this?      Thank you...

EXPERT OPINION PLEASE!?	we've been together for 4 years and i never reallly fully trusted him... ever since we start going out my world basically revolved around him and i became obsessive, possesive and that was never my plan. but it seems like, this addiction is going strong and wrong... i come to realize that, this is making me miserable and as well as my bf... although, i love him so well that it scares me just the thought of not being together. we never had on and off relationships. i thought our relationship was going strong but i just realized that its going downhill - he never cheated and i never cheated. its me, that is wrong. i am so sick of being the person who check up on him all the time, i want to feel the freedom even if i dont want to. i mean, i choose him than my own freedom (WHICH SUCKS i know) but its him that is not happy & tonight, he said so many hurtful things to me and he said he doesnt feel bad making me cry... and this feelings sucks. i am pathetic..... should i let it go? and ...

We are together for 5 yrs & lived together for almost all that time. I relocated for job purposes, she said she'd follow me but didn't and moved home instead. I did take her for granted when we lived together. I desperately missed her, and asked her to marry me at Xmas, she initiailly agreed and then went back on the decision. I then moved to her hometown which she initially was in favour of but then freaked out over.When living apart she had time to think and went to a therapist to help her with our rel. who is telling her that she needs an "emotional boundary" from me. She wanted space initially but I was so cut up over the whole thing that I could not give it. We used to meet up and things were going fine but she went to see her therapist last week and did not answer my calls when I rang her afterwards. I'm now finally going to give her some space, as much from my mental sanity as her own. I'm going to a therapist too who is telling me I need to make me happy first. She does love me

I truly just want to hang out as friends but I need some suggestions of what we could do or where we could go that wont seem like a date. I'm open to anything. Thanks!
20081124162548AAvGxi4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are good songs about being best friends with a guy, but now you wish there was more?	So I've been best friends with this guy for awhile, and he recently moved away. But before that we kinda had a small "thing" but I stopped it because I didn't want anything to happen since he was moving. But now I think I made a mistake because he's all i think about and i miss him a lot. So I just want to know if there are any good songs that kind of relate to my problem. Thanks!!
20081124163335AAx3Il8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't tell when a guy is flirting?	They can be so misleading sometimes. Also I get my hopes up too easily :(. Here's the story.. I like this guy in 2 of my classes. Sometimes he'll just say my name in class and when I look up at him, he'll be smiling. He has also done the playful teasing thing to me. I think I catch him staring from time to time. I know he notices me, that's not the problem here. The problem is that if he flirts one day, he'll pretend I don't exist for the next few days. What does all this mean? Is it flirting, yes or no? And does he like me, yes or no?
20081124163504AA19q2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need a ladies opinion! How does a guy get out of the friend zone? 10 points ?	So I am a 19 year old. Im athletic, sweet, romantic, caring. First off idk if im attractive enough. My friend is so beautiful and amazing and i dont know if im good enough for her. Anyways when we first met 3 years ago we use to flirt all the time. I thought we would wind up together. Out of the blue she started dating this guy so we just ended up becoming really good friends.

She is very important in my life. Anyways on that same day my mother met my boyfriend and she likes him a lot. A couple of days later i told my bf and he was shocked. But we both know what to do. He asked me to call my mother and he apologized to her for what he did to me- he was worried she might not ever like him.    Another issue is my bf of 4 months- his past girll cheated on him so he is very insecure. He does not like my friends. The other night i went to park my car in the back at 1am and he was leaving as well- the next day he was like where did u go after i left. Or he immidiately introduces me to people as his girlfriedn. Or I was hangin with my girl at a football game and i saw him at his job- i said hi and sat next to him. However the next day he was like in a snotty voice what did u do after i left. I don't know if these are somthg i should be worried about.

20061102121502AAFYTo6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is Simon interested in me or is he just flirting with me?	I have always found Simon attractive but it was more of a "recognizing beauty" feeling than "wanting to date him" feeling. I have never actaully bothered about him because we move in different social circles because of difference of race.       Late August, he begun raising his voice whenever I walked into a room and consequently, I noticed him. Lately, we have been looking at each other. He would sit at a bench facing my direction and then talk to his boys. Sometimes our eyes would catch. His looks are not shy looks, they are sorta assertive. I know there is no one behind me because I usually sit at the back row seats of the lecture theatres.    But i dont get him; when I am far, he talks really loudly but when i sit or stand behind him, he keeps quiet. His best friend usually talks to me but Simon always keeps quiet instead of competing for my attention. He is generally a sweet guy to everyone. I dont know whether he is interested in me or whether he is just playing my emotions?

Hey, I've been having sex now for nearly a year, but not once have I reached orgasm during intercourse. I know it is a common fact that men orgasm before a woman and that it takes women much longer, but I am curious to see what an orgasm inside is like rather than one on the clitoris.

I am worried about what the future with my boyfriend will be like. We have been together for three years.  I am becomming concerned with his lack of life skills. He can't cook. When he is hungry he just eats half a loaf of bread.  He has serious issues with hygeine. He does shower daily but doesn't feel the need to brush his teeth before he goes out. (he does do it before bed though.) His version of washing dishes is to rinse them under the water and give them a wipe with the sponge I use for cleaning the floor. He also constantly makes plans involving me and his family without informing them and I am left to intrude on their family gatherings.  He has four older sisters and is pampered and adored by his family as he is the only boy. They have always done everything for him. I am tired of cleaning up his mess and nagging him to do it. My brother has suggest I just leave him to do it himself. So i did. But the fact is the mess and problems stay there till I fix it. Can I change him?

With my job, and life, it seems like every time one problem ends, another begins.      Whether it be problems with doing my stressful, unchallenging job,   problems with not getting the positions that I deserve and want,    fights with co-workers,    almost being fired,   the fear of being fired,   the fact that guys are never interested in me,    that I'm now in love with someone that's NEVER going to love me,    vicious rumors being spread about me,    or being yelled at...   and crying at work...      It never ends.      I HATE having drama and turmoil be the main focus of my thoughts.   I'm a nice person... I get taken advantage of, and it's easy for people to pick on me, because I'm not good at defending myself... That causes more problems.

Currently we've done everything but. Now my problem is I dont want it to slow down and neither does she... but we really should slow down. We're at the point where we tell each other we love one another, but the thing is she still doesnt want to commit to labeling us with the words boyfriend/girlfriend, she says every relationship shes labeled has turned out bad, and she wants this one to last a very long time. But the thing is Im worried we're going to go too far and later feel like we should have waited... but like I said we both want too, and feel ready... Now dont get me wrong we spend alot of time talking and just cuddling, and just enjoying one anothers company. Just still our physical relationship is moving fast, should we slow down?

20070520204307AALMYjy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies (mainly around teenage) -- is anyone actually attracted to this type of personality?	I'm 19, in college, and would just like to know what kind of personalities you are attracted to in guys... I mean, it seems as if the types of guy around my age that most girls like to date are drunken extroverted slops that treat girls like crap. I have been told I'm good looking, but I would consider myself very prude. I don't smoke, drink, or party, and have never had a girlfriend, and have actual goals in life that I work very hard on pursuing. I'm short and extremely thin from XC (5'5 1/2", 105 lbs) which doesn't work in my favor, but I'm not interested in trying to become something I'm clearly not. In other words, I don't want to drink and party to gain girls' attention. This is why I was wondering if there is anyone out there that looks for guys like this, because all the girls that seem nice go for the obnoxious drunk guys. Thanks in advance for responses.

I’m too much of a chicken. and he is kindof going out with someone but not really...    but... like complicated with someone/   am i too young to be in love, (age 13) should i ask him out??? should i tell him i love him.

20080302012420AAZxOdP	Family & Relationships;Weddings	AiUTO iO E iL MiO RAGAZZO SiAMO iN CRiSi....?	una settimana fa ho parlato chiaramente al mio uomo e gli ho detto che le cose dovevano cambiare assolutamente perche` io non sono felice. lui e` troppo pigro e non fa nulla per casa, non cura molto neanche la sua igiene personale e io sono quella che cucina, lava, stira e sta dietro ai bambini, che amo da morire ma che sono suoi. non usciamo mai insieme perche` a lui non va mai di fare niente e la maggior parte delle volte e` nervoso. quando gli ho parlato lui si e` messo a piangere e mi ha chiesto scusa, mi ha detto che si rendeva conto della situazione e che sarebbe cambiato in positivo perche` non vuole perdermi. ma dopo qualche giorno tutto e` tornato come prima...a questo punto io penso che la cosa migliore sia separarci...la verita` pero` e` che non voglio lasciare i bambini e per gli ultimi sei mesi sono stata con il mio fidanzato solo per loro. e` terribile pensare che non li vedro` piu`, ma io ho solo 19 anni e anche se staro` malissimo penso che questa sia l'unica soluzione.
20080211095105AApifUV	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Non credevo di esserne capace..?	Pensavo che non lo avrei mai tradito. Andava così bene tra noi due, poi parto e arriva lui. Bello e pieno di cose dolci da dirmi. Mi sono presa una cotta in un secondo..e l'ho tradito. Ma l'altro non ha cancellato quello che provavo per il primo, l'ha offuscato per un po'.. ora torno a casa. e alla realtà. Uno mi manca e per l'altro mi sento in colpa. Provo qualcosa per tutti e due..è possibile? ma soprattutto.. devo essere, come sono sempre stata finora, sincera con il primo? questo non me lo sarei chiesto mai. Avrei subito confessato una cosa del genere (che credevo d non essere capace di fare) ma il fatto (e non è una scusa) è che lui sta passando un momento difficile. Mamma in ospedale e amici stronzi, moto dal meccanico. "Mi sembra di star perdendo tutto quello a cui tengo.. sei l'unica in grado di farmi sorridere adesso" ha detto.. aiuto..

Anche lui ha la ragazza. Poi però negli ultimi mesi qualcosa è cambiato: lui mi dice che è confuso... in poche parole credo di piacergli. Dice che non vuole rovinare la mia storia di tre anni e tanto meno la sua. Io un po' ci sono rimasta male perchè in questa amicizia ci credevo. . . non so che fare ora. Credo proprio di non farmi più sentire anche se non è giusto buttare via un'amicizia (o forse adesso non lo è più dato che gli interesso?) così. NOn voglio perderlo ma mi tocca?? aiutatemi, cosa dovrei fare secondo voi? io per ora non mi faccio viva.... già è confuso, se mi faccio sentire è peggio.

20080315110333AAasXfQ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Si sta stancanco di me...o sono io stanca di lui!????	E' un periodo che noto un atteggiamento strano nel mio ragazzo.   All'inizio sembra tutto eccitato, tutto convinto, poi, piano, piano sembra quasi che finga e che si affanni a raggiungere l'orgasmo.    In un primo momento ho pensato si stesse stancando di me.   Ma negarlo c'è il fatto che è lui che si avvicina 1-2 volte ogni giorno per fare l'amore...se fosse uno stanco, eviterebbe.   Si sa che la sessualità femminile è MOLTO delicata. BAsta una minima distrazione per smontare ore di preliminari ed infatti questo pensiero fisso mi sta rovinando tutti i momenti d'amore con lui, xkè non faccio ke stare attenta al suo atteggiamento, dimenticandomi quello che sto facendo in quel momento!! Così alla fine sono io ke sto cercando di evitare qualsiasi contatto x evitare quella situazione di imbarazzo.   Da qui la seconda domanda: ma non è ke sono io che mi sono stancata di lui!?   Lo so che mi direte: pensa a fare l'amore e basta...ma spero di ricevere anche risposte più profonde..

20071207021653AAOCxZq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Puis-je lui refaire confiance et reconstruire une amitié?	Je vous explique la situation pour que vous puissiez mieux comprendre. Mon ami est sorti pendant 2 ans avec une fille, il l'a quitté et donc 6 mois après nous nous sommes rencontrés. Cette ex était toujours présente(même amis), donc je suis devenue amie avec elle. Cependant au bout de 2 ans avec mon ami(dont 1 de vie commune), lors d'une soirée(où j'étais biens?r!), cette ex, lui a refait une grande déclaration d'amour. Allant même voir les parents de mon mec pour leur dire qu'elle l'aimait encore et qu'elle voulait le récupérer. 1 an après nous nous sommes séparés avec mon ami. Vous imaginez bien qu'elle a tout fait pour le récupérer.   Avec mon ami, nous sommes revenus ensemble et bien évidemment, cette ex est toujours présente lors de nos sorties. Je ne sais pas si, 3 ans après, je peux lui refaire confiance, être copine avec ?a après ce qu'elle m'a fait.    Merci de me donner votre avis et bonne journée!

20080413095005AA1Rq4V	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Barzelletta bellissima, SORRISO ASSICURATO?	FISCHI PER FIASCHI   Una coppia americana partecipò ad una breve vacanza in Germania.    Durante le frequenti passeggiate la signora Smith scoprì una graziosa casetta ai bordi del bosco. La scelse per trascorrervi le future vacanze estive.   Saputo che il proprietario era un sacerdote protestante, gli chiese di mostrarle la villetta. La casa sembrò alla coppia un sogno: la posizione era ottima, era arredata con gusto ed era provvista di tutti i conforts. Perciò stipularono subito il contratto di affitto.   Quando ritornarono negli Stati Uniti discussero molto come utilizzare i locali, ma ad un certo punto la signora Smith ricordò di non aver visto il W.C.   Decise perciò di scrivere al pastore per avere ulteriori informazioni.

20070621060442AAHsOiV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know if I want him and if I should risk getting rejected?	I have little experience in love so I don't know what to expect. I got to know this guy through my friend. He's kind, funny in the intelligent way, good looking. We've gotten really close but we are just good friends. He told me a long time ago he only wants to stay as friends. Anyway, I feel happy and comfortable around him. We take efforts to understand each other. But I don't feel that crazy in love thing like that back in high school. I just like to be with him. I care a lot for him. He told me the same. Recently I feel like if I don't risk talking to him taking it further we will drift apart soon even as good friends. But I also feel he is already drifting further. I am to blame partly because I keep doing the wrong things like praising other guys. On the other hand, I think our chemistry is not enough -I have a weird sense of humor that sometimes he doesn't get. I am not good enough a listener. I don't know what to do. I think I want him badly. Please help

I dont really know if he cheated he says he didnt but i think she thinks he did therefor they broke up. anyways she gave him a a choice  to either continue working on their relationship or to never talk again. for the past two weeks theyve been talking everyday and they seem like they are getting back on track yet he doesnt want to give her a final say. when she says ok im done he tells her something to give her hope.. yet he admited to still be talking to the other girls wich he says are only friends. I have ran out of words and i feel like she wants me to also give her hope but i dont have a good feeling.. i would hate for her to get hurt more. Obviously he is playing with her  telling her the more he thinks about it the more he is confused about his choice. but he doesnt want to loose her lol what a ******

20080408085035AAdh3PF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Essre usati (tradimento)?	Difficile dirlo in poche parole: 35 anni io 34 lei, 8 anni che stavamo insieme. Lei ha sempre avuto una malattia che si è risolta in parte negli anni con la chirurgia estetica. Facilmente non è in grado di concepire. Ci amiamo (o così mi ha fatto credere) Suo padre caccia di casa la moglie, Lei ,la sorella e il fratello. I suoi genitori non gli danno neanche i soldi per laurearsi. A un certo punto una notte scappa di casa, corre da mè e mi dice che dobbiamo iniziare a convivere. Io come sempre gli stò vicino, faccio il giro delle banche per il mutuo (nonostante la depressione che è saltata fuori da qualche mese, causa incertezza lavorativa) Poi un giorno io le dico che avevo bisogno di fare un giro per capire come risolvere questa depressione. Lei dopo meno di una settimana mi dice che ha un'altro. Che lo ha conosciuto una settimana prima, che non devo seguirla e che non posso avere chiarimenti. Io penso che sia un'invenzione invece da conoscenti emerge che c'èra già da diversi mesi.

Purtroppo non ricordo la data di nascita di una mia carissima amica, con la quale non ho amici in comune abitando in regioni diverse.

Potranno darmi la data di nascita o c'è qualche problema di privacy?   Altrimenti come potrei fare?

20080426105013AAuK0y5	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Morire di solitudine?	Scusatemi ho un peso nel petto e la necessità di sfogarmi con qualcuno, oggi se ne è andato uno dei miei "bimbi",si 86 anni. Sapevo che sarebbe accaduto presto, di per se fà parte della vita ma lui aveva preso questa decisione, voleva morire. Sono incazzatissima,perchè si è spento piano piano nella totale indifferenza dei 2 figli,posso affermarlo, uno lo devo vedere ancora adesso e l'altro, pensionato, c'era ogni tanto giusto per il tempo necessario di una cena o un pranzo che ormai non veniva più consumata.Mi ero permessa di dirglielo "suo padre ha bisogno della vostra presenza ,cercate di alternarvi" Troppi impegni, questa la risposta.Due giorni fà l'ho spostato nel letto vicino alla finestra, non voleva andarci "troppa luce" mi aveva detto,gli risposi "così ti faccio ciao dal mio balcone", abito di fronte. Quando sono tornata la mia collega mi ha riferito che era stato tutto il pomeriggio con lo sguardo alla finestra, da torcicollo aveva specificato, ora non c'è più, ciao DANTE....

How would you feel if a friend told you he was still in love with you years after telling you the first time?   ...I think, I MIGHT still secretly be in love with my friend, when I told her last time, she made it clear I was one of her best friends and didn't want to loose that because relationships never last.      She has a boyfriend, who I think she'll end up getting Married to.      Should I tell her my feelings never changed?   (even though I told her I moved on...)      How do you think she will react?   ...I'll still want to be friends with her even if she's not interested, but I'd like to tell her if I know its not going to make thinks awkward at all.      ..I'm so confused >_>

20080504181100AAxByNg	Family & Relationships;Friends	Religione diversa: è un ostacolo?	Abitiamo lontani, ma ci sentiamo ogni giorno via sms o mail.   Da un incontro di lavoro è nato un bellissimo rapporto d'amicizia.   Ci siamo visti poche volte, ma siamo in perfetta sintonia... stessi gusti, stesso modo di vedere le cose... però... alcuni mesi fa mi confessa di essere testimone di Geova, seppur non praticante.   Da quel giorno, ogni volta che tentiamo di vederci, lui prima si esalta... parlandone di continuo... poi disdice per improvvisi impegni. E torna a cercarmi il giorno seguente come se nulla fosse e, passato del tempo, ripropone di vederci.      Io sono cattolica praticante, faccio politica, studio all'università, fumo sigarette e i miei sono divorziati.   Tutte cose che un testimone di Geova non tollera.      Come può essere nata un'amicizia se io rappresento tutto ciò che per lui è blasfemo?   Cosa non mi torna?   E' combattuto se frequentarmi o meno?      Voi che ne pensate?

Theres this guy i dated about a year ago he hurt me pretty badly(long story) but he recently said sorry for it he wrote me said he has changed he knew he messed up and really wanted to be friends( he wrote alot more than that). I never really got over him!!! Hes been dating this girl for about a month and half. He started dating her 2wks after he wrote me. He says(ive heard) hes in love with her. I dont talk to him cause whats the point?? I really cant be his friend. I sent him a text not from my phone but my friends phone saying that i love him and that i hope his happy. Ofcourse he had no idea who it was cause he didnt know the number. He kept calling and texting asking who it is. But my friend never answers. It was just something that i needed to do. Atleast he knows someone loves him and wishes him the best.
