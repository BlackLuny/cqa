They leveled the warehouse completely and no Osama. As a matter of fact no terrorist what so ever.

They are taught that, by their religion, those who die in the service of Islam have a special place in their heaven and are promised many heavenly delights.<br>  <br>  To us, that means they are basically brainwashed since they are raised from birth to believe Islam is the only way.<br>  <br>  ""<br>  Although sharing some similarities, the concept of heaven in Islam is different in many respects to that found in Judaism and Christianity. Chiefly, Heaven (Jannat) is described in physical terms, using jewellery, and food. The Islamic texts describes life for its immortal inhabitants, one that is happy — without hurt, sorrow, fear or shame — where every wish is fulfilled. Traditions relate that inhabitants will be of the same age (32 years for men as the same age when Jesus ascended), and of the same stature. Their life is one of bliss including: wearing costly robes, bracelets, perfumes; partaking in exquisite banquets, served in priceless vessels by immortal youths; reclining on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Other foods mentioned include meats, scented wine and clear drinks bringing neither drunkenness nor rousing quarreling. Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents, wives, and children (provided they were admitted to paradise) — conversing and recalling the past. Texts also relate "pure consorts" (houris), created in perfection, with whom carnal joys are shared — "a hundred times greater than earthly pleasure".<br>  <br>  ""<br>  <br>  So basically, the martyr enjoys all the comforts of heaven and carnal joys.

AA10199189	love it!<br>  <br>  journalism - the job in its broadest form entails gathering factual information about certain events or people etc which may have an influence upon some aspect of one's society, finding quotable sources, presenting one's facts in a clearly written way - including representative quotes from the opposing viewpoint (unless you are writing op-ed)<br>  and making it interesting, concise and topical.<br>  <br>  sometimes it can be dangerous - such as when one is working on an expose; sometimes it can be boring - such as when one is writing about golf tournaments;  sometimes an issue can alter one's entire viewpoint as one learns that what one had originally thought to be one way is really another.  but there is always something new and different.  many people think that newspapers are on the way out as everyone is rushing to be a blogger - but don't believe it.  for one thing, people like to sit down and read their paper in a leisurely way, some like to have it folded quite small so they can read it while on the subway, and one can't do that with a computer.<br>  <br>  and advertisers do not like to shell out the exorbitant amounts being aske for on-line ads, and are finding that it is more cost-effective to advertise in the paper.

The little boy and his father were living with the father's pregnant girlfriend and her child.  I am very uncomfortable with these live-in relationships where children are often exposed to unstable, undercommitted adult relationships and the problems that occur in them.  Too often children in these situations are exposed to a series of live-ins with whom they have no secure emotional attachment, where there is domestic violence, and exposure to adult sexuality.  Even when these situation are overt, the child's needs are often secondary to the adult's relationship needs  - and the child usually knows this on some level.  Childrens' problem solving is often rooted in the adult problem solving modeled around them.  I hate to blame the victim but the child is also the victim.  These tragedies do not surprise me.|`|un0C52G8aa	I would prefer to wait until all the fact are out before I make my judgments on this case.

This should be limited until someone is mature enough to be able to handle these things and know the difference.  <br>  <br>  If there are problems in the home, there should be counseling before something like this gets that bad.  <br>  <br>  One should not live with another, especially if kids are involved, until there is marriage and they all have counseling to be able to help blend together.  <br>  <br>  There could have been anger that this woman took his real mothers "place", or something like that.  <br>  <br>  I will pray for all involved and that this sort of thing does not happen again.

He already has several blog articles.|`|AA11570618	Our world has become a society filled with the need for instant gratification. Today, young people are bombarded with - and encouraged to - participate in sexual activities outside of marriage. Movie stars, celebrities, political leaders, religious principals, educators and others in authority demonstrate - daily - a disrespect for the sanctity of sex. The 'norm' today is 'bass-ackwards': we have sex first, become pregnant, and, then (if the mood strikes us) marry. <br>  I'm not a youngster, nor am I a very religious person. I'm a 65-year-old man who has been married four times. Each time, sex was part of the relationship prior to the marriage. Alcohol, drugs, and a cavalier attitude of "all for one, ME" prevailed in each instance. And every time the marriage ultimately failed. My first marriage ended in divorce when I was just 21 years old. <br>  If i had it to do all over again, I'd 'wait for marriage' for a number of reasons:<br>  a) Sex should be something incredibly private and exclusively special between two people. If you wait until after marriage, sex can become the new 'adventure' in your relationship, something wherein both partners can experiment and share their deepest intimacies;<br>  b) Sex before marriage poses the question, "How many others have their been?" And, that leads to concerns about sexually-transmitted diseases;<br>  c) I personally believe that by 'waiting' until marriage, it strengthens the marriage - and imposes less possibility for infidelity;<br>  d) Sex becomes the one pinnacle in a relationship, something that both partners know they've never shared with anyone else. That makes it extraordinarily special, private and exclusive.<br>  If I had it to do all over again, I'd 'wait for marriage'. Take it from someone who's "been there".     -RKO-   02/22/09
JSjBecVHaa	6) Because it's a waste of time. Overpaid actors patting themselves on the back and starving for more attention.|`|H8MGismEaa	The Academy Awards has become a soapbox of sorts. Boring. They need to shut up and act. Hollywood lost it's charm and gained a bad flavor. The stars of yesteryear would be appalled.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Toxic levels of self-absorption and earnest pomposity.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	I'm boycotting the oscars because of what they did during the president campaign, how the demos all wanted change, I think they should stick to acting and not try to sway peoples mind into doing what they think is best.|`|tguEmxVyaa	The Sanford and Son Marathon is on.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	Because so many actors are spoiled rich brats.|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	How about I haven't wanted to see any of the films and I could not care less.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	I really don't care what Hollywood does nor their ultra Liberal actors. I hope they strike and don't work for years. That would be great. Let's see if they have to live within the salary cap that will be set by our President soon. My life will go on quite well without Hollywood or movies.|`|AA11476439	1) They are boring<br>  2) It is more about issues than talent<br>  3) Too much glitz /not enough glamor<br>  4) Media coverage goes on for weeks before & weeks after|`|m4MpQ258aa	Too many arrogant people patting themselfs on the back.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	I don't feel like vomiting this evening
I1Hu4jmyaa	All bad, zero good.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	I think he has did a lot of things. Dats what I think.|`|tA5NXIZdaa	Why would you have to write a paper about obama??<br>  <br>  Its barely been a month with him in office how can he have done ANYTHING??<br>  <br>  Why couldnt your teacher tell you that in about 6 months or so?|`|R49w1Dr7aa	The bad thing he did is run for president<br>  The other bad thing is he was elected<br>  Can't think of any good...unless he quit smoking.|`|aqlnTbOSaa	He spent 36 billion a day so far!!!
My65doewaa	Obama rode race to the White House.  You can't engage in racism and end it at the same time..|`|dGiYVfw6aa	No. Actually some of his people have made statements that could cause divisiveness. The reverend that said "when white embraces what's right". One of his economic advisers said they have to make sure stimulus jobs "don't just go to white male construction workers". <br>  And the new attorney general just said "we are a nation of cowards because we don't want to talk about race". Like it or not, these kinds of statements are offensive to some white people. If we have to be careful not to offend minorities than we should get that same respect in return. Black people don't have to sit in the back of the bus anymore. Black people can go to any restaurant they want to. And now we have a black president and a black attorney general. Obama's people need to stop making statements that make it sound like white people are so bad. And please don't make is seem like only whites are racists. I have been told by other races that they didn't like me because I was white. So all races can be racist.  After all, Obama would not have won the election if a lot of whites didn't vote for him.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Unfortunately there will always be racism in the u.s., in the north there still calling people those damn yankees. And I'm a mother of 3 grown children and they to say things that are inappropriate, maybe another 100yrs from now.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	No but his choice for Attorney General Eric Holder, just set race relations back by decades simply by calling white US citizens cowards.|`|a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	I have to say I totally agree with Mark S. Obama hasn't ended racism in America at all. I don't think it will ever end no matter who is president.|`|JSjBecVHaa	No. His election is a good thing for race relations, but some old bigots need to die off, (both black and white ones), before racism will be on its way out.|`|VteSW8nBaa	For the entire primary campaign, even the (unbiased LOL) press praised him as "the first viable BLACK candidate.  Then, he was hailed as the first true BLACK candidate form one of the two mainstream parties. His election campaign was greeted with the media showing clip after clip of "we need to elect a BLACK president.  And his election was greeted with "the first BLACK president.  (The capitals are not to disparage his race.  I could not care less what race he is, if he were a good president, which I don't think he is.  I use the capitals to express the divisive racespeech used by the media and Obama supporters, who claim they want to end the divisiveness of racism.  BTW, I am niether black or white.)(BTW-until he proves he is a citizen of the US, we have no legitimate president. See the Constituion of the United States of America)<br>  <br>  Race is what we are.  Just as we can say "that blonde girl over there" to denote the person without it making aspersions about the person herself, we can use race (eg."which one is Dave?  The white guy or the black one") to denote a person without it describing his/her  personality.  If we make any decision based mainly or soley on a person's race, we are racist.  (We can't be colorblind.  That isn't possible. We can base our dicisions, as ML King Jr. said, on character instead of color (or sex, nationality, religion, etc. etc. etc.)).|`|Hlh90tClaa	No and he wont.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Mark S said it well and I agree with him

aGcRB3pyaa	I heard it was a mutual parting of the ways, which usually means he was fired.
IsGo50kqaa	Technically, the Korean War never ended as only an Armistice was signed - a treaty never followed.  Both sides are facing off across no-man's land but the mini war going on there from the 50s to 80s has all but ended.  Both sides co-operate on some DMZ issues.  Fearless Leader (my name - see Rocky and Bulllwinkle - for the schizo maniac leader of northern Korea) has once again threatened war and one can never trust a crazy person but, in the past, he would do this to raise the stakes so he could then get some limited gain.  He has an out-of-date military and Korea doesn't so I believe it to be more, umm, active diplomacy, from him.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	There is a "detente" in Korea. Whether the land breaks out in war again is up to the jerks in Northern Korea. <br>  The land has had a civil war in the 1950s and it came to a stop but with a great deal of tension between the North and the South. We call it a detente.|`|fFq68dJYaa	They have their local variant of cold war.|`|3LOLGaOMaa	not really...<br>  north korea says that they are "weaponized" so now south korea has been keeping their military near the border.<br>  North Korea was quoted saying they want “all out confrontational posture” meaning that North Korea wants a face to face meeting with South Korea, a hostile one, without warfare though. <br>  <br>  you could say that they are having a "cold war" not an offical one though. both are waiting to see what the other one does. <br>  <br>  but it is said that this will not lead to war at all because north korea wants to set up their ‘negotiating position’ with our new President.|`|CCl6Eexcaa	Yes, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) are still technically at war. The Korean War's start is June 25th 1950 on the day that NK mobilized armed forces and crossed the 38th parallel into SK. <br>  <br>  To end a war technically, the waring states need to sign a peace treaty. Saying who is surrendering and on what terms if any. This has not happened since the beginning of the war in 1950, thus the two nations are still technically at war, although there is not the daily military action that one associates with war time.<br>  <br>  This is because on July 27th 1953 the parties involved, China, NK, US, and SK, agreed to an armistice. An armistice is what people really mean when they talk about the cease-fire to the Korean War. It says that both sides will lay down their arms while/until/if a peace treaty is negotiated. The benefit is no more fighting and neither party has to surrender. However, the downside is that it means the parties are still at war and can act as warring states to an extent.<br>  <br>  North Korea on occasion threatens to disregard the armistice, when it's angry about one thing or another,  claiming that it is not even legitimate because SK never signed it; it was only signed by NK, US and China.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  p.s. That's an answer on one main level of the Korean War, if you want to talk about he Korean War as far as expanding US Hegemony, or as a proxy war, there are so many different avenues to explore.
