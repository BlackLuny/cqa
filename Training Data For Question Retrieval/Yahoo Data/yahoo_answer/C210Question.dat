I'm a 14-year-old girl and I've just started my course work for O-levels and I'm finding everything overwhelming at the moment. From home life to school life everything is just piling up and I'm extremely stressed. So I keep tiny bottles of whiskey and scotch in my dresser draw to help me sleep at night. I didn't really think anything of it because my grandma does this all the time! I never get REALLY drunk - tipsy, more like- and i feel a little bit calmer once I've had a drink, even if it's just a few sips. I was tested for anemia this morning and i was wondering whether the alcohol could have been detected in my blood sample? I had a few swigs of whiskey last night (9:30 pm -ish)and another swig when i woke up (6:45 am) and i had my blood test at 9:15. How long does it take for alcohol to run out of your system? Or did i not drink enough for it to show?

I am going to Halloween Horror Nights this Friday with a bunch of friends and I really want my mom to come. Because all she does is stay home and clean all day, I want her to get out and have fun with me and my friends on Friday! My mom says she doesn't wanna go because shes afraid the dogs will destroy the house, but I told her they'll be fine. She says she used to go to HHN when she was young I dont get why she wont go now.   My friends told me if she says she doesn't wanna come then just stop asking her. I know their saying that because they dont want my mom hanging around but I dont give a **** what they say lol. I just want my mom to get out and have fun with me.   Any tips to change her mind?   
20081019033634AAWUQ4L	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Should I or shouldn't I give my son my dads name as his middle name?	Hi everyone. I have a little dilemma here. Im currently preggies and early next year we will be having a little baby boy. We currently have a girl. My husband and I were both raised by our dads coz our mothers abandoned us when we were young so our dads raised us. My husband's dad was a really good man and worked hard all his life but has recently died. We have decided to call our newborn son Caleb after my husbands dad. I was thinking that since my dad did the whole thing on raising me as well I would give my son the middle name Kon (Connor) after my dad. But the thing is my dad would and has done everything for me but he is not really a roll model. He is a typical old Greek man that wants his own way all the time, he always is right and everyone is wrong and has been know to be violent towards other people and once or twice been in trouble with the police for this, but really he is a gentle man that loves his grandchildren sooo much but usually talks without thinking first. I know he means well but other people could and do take him the wrong way. So my question is do you think I should give our son my dads name as my son's middle name considering the type of person he is. If my dad likes you he will be your best friend and do anything for you but if he doesn't like you then you wouldn't want to be on bad side. Im not sure if my dad really deserves the honor in my son carrying his name but it would be nice to name our one and only son after both our dads. What do you think?

Hey mummy's to be, i was wondering if anyone wanted to share any moments of absolute stupidity due to ''baby brain''... i experienced my first baby brain moment last week at the doctor's surgery when the receptionist asked if i had a mobile phone, i said yes and she said can i have it? And without even thinking i opened my bag, got my phone out and handed it to her. She just sat there staring at me with a blank look on her face for about a minute then she said ''no, your mobile phone number, not your actual phone''. At that point i was so embarassed my face had turned completely red and i just wanted to run and hide, i look back and laugh now but at the time it was so humiliating, she must have thought i was crazy!!
20081102013435AAQsKSe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Miscarriage mothers, am I alone?	Do you think it is ok for a woman who has had a miscarriage to consider herself- even refer to herself as a mother?      Its hard, because, sometimes I want to say "as a mother..." but I don't have much more behind me than 17 weeks gestation :(...yet i still feel liek a mother. I have had childcare experience.      Its just that- when someone asks for advice, they tend to only view info from other mother's as valid. I can say "I'm trained" but they'll say "Yes, but you don't have that mother's edge".      So, even if I never carried to term- is it still ok for me to say "I know what it means to have mother's love" even if I'm not certain whether or not I do? (You see, I loved my baby, but I never experience that whole "I have never known love until now" moment)

20081114075211AADw8pl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	12 week abortion, recovery time?	My girlfriend announced yesterday that she was having an abortion of a 3 month old baby. She only gave me an hours notice. She had the appointment for 9.30am and was out apparently by 4.30pm. Is this too quick to be out? She said she booked the appointment a week ago but not sure if I believe her.   Also she would surely need some recovery time? She got out of hospital yesterday and went to her Uni classes today! Surely she needs to stay in bed for a few days? I'm wondering if she really did have the abortion?   I need to add before some of you jump on my back. She kept it from me for month and never told until two days ago. I never had a say in the situation and she has split up with me because of this. So she has killed my baby and our loving relationship.   We had everything and we were so happy. She told me Monday night about the baby and that we were over. I made a 4 hour dash to go and see her Tuesday night to talk about things. She was stubborn and wouldn't budge and maintained that it was over. However,  a few hours later we spent the night together in bed, as well as touching the baby and feeling the love. She then has the abortion. I offered to help her in every way and after the abortion yesterday she seemed ok with me and much more relieved. Then today she tells me again it's over. This has destroyed me and I'm not sure I can get through it.
20081114083549AA1UsY4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How likely would twins be?	Twins are pretty common in my family. It seems to skip every other generation though. My father is a twin and he has three sets of twin cousins but I don't have one set of twins within my group of cousins.      On my mother's side there are also a fair amount of twins. My grandmother is one of them.      If I were to get pregnant would it be very likely that I'd have twins?

The hospital sent her home, and told her miscaraige is iminant, and to just put her feet up. these two hospitals are known for ignoring things like this.. but that aside, is this a normal practice, or is this hospital just ignoring this girl because they just don't care?? any suggestions on what to do?

20081121214942AAMqkAq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Having my first child alone. Help?	Not sure how to explain my situation, because if I did, we'd be here all day. well my name's Luna, I'm 26 years old, and I'm pregnant for the second time, but about to have my first child. I was pregnant for the first time three years ago, right before Hurricane Katrina went through Louisiana. My fiancee (at the time) and I were both from Louisiana, so he left me behind to go stay with his family and wait out the Hurricane with them. That was the last time I saw him alive. I lost the baby after that, and was told I could never have another baby and that I was infertile, so of course, after that, I just didn't worry about birth control. Two years after my fiancee died, I met my boyfriend, who is now currently my ex. I thought he was going to marry me. Well, he wasn't. When I found out that I was pregnant, I was already three months in. He ran away, claiming to be going to school, and hasn't been seen since. Well now I'm 22 weeks pregnant, all by myself, and expected to be having a little girl in March. I wanted to have a home (water) birth, but where I live (and I no longer live in Louisiana) there are hardly any midwives around, and I have no one who could be there and help me, except for my very unconcerned 13 year old sister that I'm currently raising. To add to the stress, I am a school 10th grade Biology teacher and I don't take leave until about 34 weeks, for the reason that I get hardly any time for maternity leave.      I suppose the question is, how am I going to be able to, as stress free as possible, bring a new baby into the world with no father and such low pay? How can I deal with all of this?

20070504091041AAHD4DF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Scelta difficile, cosa devo fare?	ciao a tutti, sono ormai alla 21 settimana di gravidanza e da pochi giorni ho avuto gli esiti della villocentesi : purtroppo la mia bambina ha una trisomia del cromosoma 2, anomalia non compatibile con la vita. Il medico mi ha detto che è megli interrompere la gravidanza visto che secondo lui ci sono poche speranze che la gestazione arrivi a termine e che la bambina nasca viva. Mi ha detto che è strano che sia arrivata a 21 settimane. ho fatto un'ecografia oggi pomeriggio e la bambina è ancora viva, si muove e il suo cuoricino batte forte. quindi io non ho il cuore di interrompere la gravidanza anche se tutti i dottori mi dicono che non arriverà mai a termine e che la bambina è destinata a morire entro poco. Voi cosa fareste al mio posto? andreste avanti ugualmente anche se è molto doloroso o interrompereste la gravidanza? aiutatemi vi prego     grazie

20070731020604AAsIjWp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Il parto: momento intimo o festa in famiglia?	Avevo già fatto questa domanda poco tempo fa, la ripeto per leggere altre risposte: secondo voi la nascita di un figlio dev'essere un momento che i genitori devono vivere da soli, in intimità, o una festa familiare? Io e mio marito preferiremmo un momento intimo, perchè mi sentirei più tranquilla se amici e parenti aspettassero a casa invece di affollare l'ospedale, e perchè vorrei che io e mio figlio avessimo tempo di riprenderci prima di affrontare il tourbillon delle visite. Dicendo che non voglio nonni e zii in ospedale, non intendo tagliarli fuori, intendo solo dire che per i festeggiamenti c'è tempo. La mia idea magari sarebbe fare una festicciola al ritorno a casa, come si usa per esempio in Russia (lo so da un film che ho visto).

I notice when I look around that a lot of toddlers are still in diapers and their parents aren't even trying to potty-train. I understand each child is different, but some of these kids are too big to be wearing diapers.      My mom had both me and my sister potty trained before we were 14 months old. We were both walking completely before age one. I understand that might be a little extreme. But I think by two years old... a child should be potty trained.

I know I can't give my child the life they deserve. I'm a kid myself and my baby deserves better. What's best for him or her is more important than what I want. So I needed some advice on adoption. (Abortion is not an option at all. I hate it.)      If I want an open adoption, do the adoptive parents have to grant it if they want my child?    And should I change my mind, how far along can we be in the process before I can't keep him or her?      Any advice you can offer me is greatly appreciated.

20090309215430AASdeSv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Weird case of child abuse......?	okay well it all started with the 1 month a half old baby crying a lot.. then next thing we know the ambulance was at their house took the baby and took him to the e.r with his arm fractured and his ribs too...well they took the baby away from them..well the wierd thing is that they say they didnt do it .. and they are real loving parents and real protective over their baby.. but the case is really weird...   becasue the dad (my brother in law is the one who noticed the babys arm was broken) and they say that they did some research on this disease on babys that makes thri bones break alone... well i dont know what this disease is called... i just want to know if anyone knew anything about it.. or is it possible for the babys bones to just break alone .... the baby is in a foster home now.. and the other weird thing is that .. both the parents are nothing but 15 years old both... and this past weekend they were begging us to take them to the mall.. so that morning we took them to eat and then in the afternoon we took them to the mall which they didnt even seem like they miss their baby.. well kindof they did cuz they were talking about him.. but she bought herself some clothes.. who would be in the mood to buy their selves some clothes when they took their baby days before.... the family and my husband say they didnt do it... but i am the only one that suspects that they did . or i dont know....im not saying they did it because they are young ... becasue i have a 3 year old boy and i just turned 19 last year..  had him when i was 15 .. and i think i am a good mom.. i never beat my son.... what do ya'll think? could he have done it? but  they are so loving to that baby..? but sometimes they seem like they dont care .. also does anyone know about that disease?
20090309172752AA9pWxd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	At what age did you first have a birthday party for your child and invited his/her friends?	My daughter is turning five soon and i have been debating if i should invite some of her friends from pre-school or just keep it family again. My concern about inviting friends is that the parents will want to stay. We don't have a lot of money to work with, so i'm thinking more people will mean more cost. I know that i wouldn't leave my 5 year old at a strangers house ( i don't know any of the parents). So i'm thinking i will just keep it family again this year (though my daugher keeps pressing for her friends to come over). So when did you have your first party for your child where it wasn't just family? thanks (sorry this is so long)

20090309222714AAfpYze	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	So over my poor lil girl being sick :(....?	My almost 18 month old daughter just seems to be continually unwell, last week she had her 4th ear infection and as of yesterday has somehow picked up an upper respiratory infection (she hasn't even been to day care or around other kids in nearly 2 weeks), the dr's cant give her anymore antibiotics as she just finished a course and even if they wanted to i would be a bit unsure. I just dont know what i am doing wrong i feed her well her fav foods are banana's, blueberries, cheese, and vegie mash, i even give her infant vitamins. What else can i do? I have taken so much time off work ( i have been back for a year and have maybe worked 6 months out of the year) im terrified of losing my job, my partner seems to think i over react and that she could be in day care but i dont like her to go when she is unwell even if she isn't contagious as i think it is wrong to leave her in the care of others while she is unwell....i know this just sounds like a rant but i am so down in the dumps because of this and i feel awful for my poor baby girl....anyone got similar problems or solutions or even just some nice words to make my day a lil better :)
20090309181005AAMOJTs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I dont know what to do...help please?	Ok, so my brother Jake is 18.  I have trust issues, and Jake is pretty much the only guy I trust (besides my boyfriend). Anyways, Jake has this friend name Tyler, who is also 18.  I know Tyler is not a good kid.  Jake was a good kid until he started hanging out with Tyler. I think they may be doing drugs.        I went downstairs to Jakes room to tell him our mom was on the phone (my parents are in nevada, so we are home alone) and he sprayed something, then unlocked the door.  When he opened the door it was kind of smokey.  It smelled really bad, too.  Jake is always either in his room or at Tylers.  Tylers parents do not care what he does, so who knows what they do at Tylers house. Jake has told me that he goes out and parties and gets drunk, I'm pretty sure that at the parties he goes to, there are people there with drugs.      I don't know if these are good reasons or not, or if I am just paranoid or something.  And I don't even know if this makes sense, there are so many things going through my head right now.      My question is, what should I do.  I know I should tell someone, but I can't.  Jake is the only guy who has always been there for me, and I fear that if I tell someone I think he might be doing drugs, that our bond will go away.  Jake has helped me through so many things, and he is always looking out for me.  He trusts me, and I trust him.  I love him and don't want his future to be ruined (he's a senior).

Please tell me what to stay clear of and what i should look for.

My son will be 12 mo. 2 weeks approx. when my daughter is born in May. My husband is currently deployed so I need a stroller where I can lug them out comfortably and one that can fit in the trunk of my 05 honda civic (sedan) suggestions??      also the single i have we bought on sale at walmart, it was great for all of 2 weeks before the plastic pieces began to bend and now i hate taking it anywhere, so i need something durable, ill pay a little more...will not pay more than 300 though, in fact less than that is ideal, i know quality costs, but i can't spend more than i can afford. Thanks you all!!!!!

My gf is pregnant. Today my sister got sent to the office and ,ade a joke of it. I grounded her and took her phone, laptop, and grounded her for a month. She wasn't happy so she kicked my pregnant gf in the stomach hard. I want to take her to the Dr's but she is throwing stuff at me and screaming as well as cursing. She is 13. I know that is too old for a spanking but in her case it is not because she always acts like a toddler. She is out of control. I put her in timeout for 15 didn't phase her. She cursed I ignored it and when the 4 year old repeated it I gave him a light tap on him butt. She is doing whatever she wants. I tried talking to her and she hit me across the dace. She spanked her 9 year old brother for hitting her and spanked the 4 year old because he was being obnoxious and doing things that are NOT allowed in the house. Does she deserve a spanking? I have taken everything away. She refuses to go to the Dr's and if I get close to her she will scream and throw something. How should I spank her and with a hairbrush or spoon? Please help!!!

20090309200937AAig5WQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Please Help us name our second son! :)?	Ok...here is my dillemma. We have a son who is 16 months old. His name is Alijah Jose Martinez (Jose is my husbands name). We just found out we are having another boy in a few months and I don't want the second boy to feel left out because our first child got my husbands first name as his middle name. So, we are putting our fathers middle names as our new son's middle name(s) (we can't decide on who's father and we like the way the initials will look) so he can feel special too. I really like the name Alonzo, and it's growing on my husband. My dad's name is Craig Allen but I don't like Allen, but I do like Callen (with the C from Craig and the Allen put together) and my husband's dad's middle name is Elias. So our new son's name would be Alonzo Callen Elias Martinez. His initials would be ACE-M. Also, I need to know, what do you think of the name Alonzo??? I know there is a lot we are working from here, but I NEED some input!!! Please HELP!!

People sorta concider him a nerd...      - I feel unwanted. No one wants to be my partner in school projects. I end up going solo.       - I'm ugly. No one pays attention to me. I feel like wallpaper      - I've never recieved a compliment. (from guys or girls)       - Whenever I walk into the lunch room, i get this feeling. No one looks at me and asks me to sit with them. No one turns around to see me and smiles. I try to sit down with other people but i feel so awkward and no one looks/ talks to me      - I have the whole typical teenage body issue problems.       - I have NOOOOO social life. I RARELY go to see movies with friends. I never go to the mall with buddies. I dont hang out at the beach on sunny days. I do nothing and just surf the web.       - I've been at the same school since Kindergarten (** our school is K-12**) and so the people aren't going to change. I can't make new friends at another school. I have no friends at other school.       - I do noooo activites outside of school so i can't / dont have ANY friends outside of school      - I've thought of becoming bulimic.       - I try hide myself from everyone with baggy clothing because i think i'm fat (101 lbs....... 5'1)          and people tease me because they say I look like an ape. Even people in younger grades think i look like an ape.          Seriously. I need help. I need someone to give me advice on ANY of these points.       PLEASE PLEASE reply.

20090309214515AAANJyg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Catch-22 babysitting situation, are there any suggestions?	I'm currently watching two little boys. A ten-month-old and a three-year-old. My problem is with the three-year-old and only on certain days. See, the kid has a tendancy to scream when he's cranky, at the top of his lungs, when he doesn't want to do something. Usually I ignore him and he stops in one or two minutes at the most.       However, on certain days, my job is to watch the kids while the mother gets some sleep after having worked nights. So ignoring the screaming is not an option and none of the prescribed discipline - placing him in his room because he will still scream. again, usually if you ignore him, two minutes later he'll be playing quietly in said room and can come out to be with me and his brother -works  because he sits in the bedroom. But I can't just let him do what he wants because it usually involves being mean to his brother. The mother assured me that it's not my fault and that her son is just in a mood, but are there any suggestions how I can get him to be quiet.       I'm pretty sure that he's trying to wake his mother up.

20090309225524AAMJ0t7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How many times do you change your baby's diaper daily?	I asked this question because my brother's ex-girlfriend says she change her 3-month-old baby's diaper once a day just to "save money". She buys the diapers where there's like 40 in a pack and I asked her why didn't buy in bulk and she says it's too expensive. I know I cahange my baby's diaper way more than once a day, but my nephew can develop a rash down there and will mess up his clothes if she doesn't change his diaper more often. Plus my brother is fighting for sole custody because of this and rather have our mom or myself babysit my nephew when he's at work, not his ex. Holla back!

My ex got expelled from school recently and the night after it happened he called to tell, but the call was short and I haven't heard from him since. I've tried to texting him, but he never texted back and I'm too nervous to call. I don't know why, it's just every time I decide to call my stomach feels like it has butterflies, but in a bad way, and I never end up calling. I haven't heard from him since and I'm so sad.      I remember the night he ran away, I didn't see him for days and then he FINALLY called me and said he was perfectly fine and back home. He told me "everything is ok now. It's fixed. Nothing bad is ever gonna happen again". But then that following week he was taken away from me and sent to rehab for almost a month. When he got back, I was so happy, because we could finally be together (in a friend way), but then he got expelled. Now I have no contact with me.      I feel so bad, because I think I still really like him and I'm so worried for him and I think it's not fair to my current boyfriend, because I always find myself worrying and trying to get into contact with my ex more than him. Does that make me a bad person? Because I think I still like my ex. I miss him so much.      Have you ever been a situation like this? What do you think I should do? Keep texting him? I had this question all planned out in my head, now I forgot what I was originally gonna ask out of this...haha. But really, what should I do? I love my boyfriend, but I love my ex too. I need help.

How long can they abandon their child before you think they shouldn't be allowed back in the child life?  Or should they always be allowed in?       - Is it better for a child to know their biological parents, even when the parent hasn't been there for most of the childs life?  Or do you think it just messes things up?      Getting an overall opinion.  I'm sorta in the middle.  I WANT to say once a parent decides to not be around..no take backs.

20090309213116AAbnU85	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Can you help me out with this?	I am 19 and living at home and I like it but at the same time I could break my window and stab myself with a shard of glass right though the heart right about now.       I love my mom, she is nice and sweet and I like being around her.    BUT   All my friends are getting to be adults. They are moving out, two are getting married and here I am off in teenage land.       Right now, I feel like I need an L branded across my forehead. L for loser.          I don't get to stay out late because my mom is my ride places.    And my brother is in middle school and the disturbance of me coming in would make my mom angry.    She tries to make me go to bed at 11. Haha the joke about the drunken elf if funnier.   She makes me go to class.    She tells me if I can and can't go somewhere.         Not only that but she name calls and cuts me down.   And, this is the icing on the cake. She thinks that I trash talk about her behind her back. This is complaining about the stupid idiotic rules and restrictions I have.          An ex-co worker told me she is going to GIVE me her car as soon as she decides which new one she wants to buy. I told my mom this (via text) and she called me and was like "Why is she just giving it to you?" And I told her because I went up and asked if she had sold it yet and she had said no and I have asked a million times about it and when she does sell it she is just going to give it to me. My mom was like "Did you tell her you think I am a horrible mother and you want one so you can move out?"      Hello, I need a job.    I need health insurance.   And yes, I do need to move. I am NOT a child and I am tired of living a childs life.       1. How can I convince her that I do not trash talk her?    And that I complain about my rules all the time because I rather eat shyt and die than deal with them.       2. How can I make her see that EVERYONE is moving out because this is college, moving out is what you do?      3. How can I get her to loosen up?         I want to come and go as I please.    I want to be able to do whatever I want.    And living with a friend in an apartment will help me do that.
20090309213721AA8XEhc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this unreasonable at 19?	I am 19 and I live at home.    I do go to college.       I want to be able to stay out till whatever time I want to.   If it gets to a time that would be too late for me to be coming in, I want to be able to crash at a friends place.    I want to be able to hang out with whoever I want.    I want to be able to stay over at guys houses. Not like to have sex but like to crash. Like if its aguy friends house and I drink too much I won't drive or expect her to come get me but she'd have a problem with me staying.    Basically, I want to be a young adult and do as I please.    Repect her no coming in after certain hours by crashing other places.       Is this too unreasonable at 19?

20090309210514AAoKhCn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What's your advice? Just venting............?	Im 16, Female. Well, my father got locked up when I was 6, and every since then Ive been rebellious. I forgave him because if I didnt, I wouldnt even talk to him. He gets mad when my mother and I argue because when he was gone, she was the only one there to lash out at, so Im used to it. He came back home when I was 10 and expected things to be the same as when he left. I was a preteen and when I would get 'smart' with my mom, he would threathen, even hit me sometimes. He left again, and got his own apartment and moved out. That made me even more angry. Then he came trailing right back into our lives like nothing happened. My mother pisses me off cause she excepts it like nothingg. When I was 13, on my birthday, he went out and cheated on my mom with some woman he met on a bus stop. He called from her house and cursed both me/my mom out. Then the woman called and called my mom all types of names, and threatened her. The next thing you know, he's right back in my mother's house like nothing happened. He blamed it all on me. Ive called the cops on him several times, the cops always side with him. He's left the house numerous times, for days at a time. Comes back with no explanation. My mom doesnt want me to ask questions, she gets mad when I get mad. Im supposed to act like nothing happened. Recently, he left, came back at like 3AM, and they were downstairs yelling, I shut my door because I was sleep and had school the next morning. Then, he yelled, "I CANT LIVE HERE WITH THAT BIT*H!!", talking about me. I ignored him for two weeks, up until today. Now Im back to ignoring both of them. Im seriously disgusted with them. Im messing up in school, they dont let me go out and get out of this house. Im sick of her letting him tropple over her. They blame me for everything. Im not the stereotypical teen, I dont do any wrong except for maybe not cleaning my room, and getting smart sometimes. They criticize me for everything and they dont do any wrong in their book. Im just sick of living here, and I feel close to insanity because I feel emotionally abused. I cry almost every week, it's really taking a toll on me. =( I feel like when he leaves, its the same as when I was 6, no explanations, not knowing what happened to my own father. Its just so overwhelming, and Im supposed to act like nothings going on. I just told them not to say anything to me anymore.
20090309215301AAfsYwc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am 5 weeks pregnant and have been spotting for two days now!?	It started with really light brown discharge, then it turned into pink yesterday and today it's even darker! I feel that when sometimes (not everytime) i urinate it burns a little and then i see blood, only when i urinate. not other wise like it's not staining anything. I went to see my doc and she checked down there, she told me that the cervix is closed, which is a good thing, but she did see some fresh blood. What does that mean? they took a blood sample ton check my hcg levels n have called me back on Thursday to for another sample. I will be going for an ultrasound on wednesday.    My question is if the cervix is closed and i'm still bleeding what can it be? will i lose my baby?

20090309210057AAM5ug6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Sexual education being taught in schools?	Did they just stop teaching sex ed. in schools or what? Although, even if it was outlawed, where the heck is the 'birds and the bees' talk?  I've seen so many posts on this site from teenagers that have no idea about the reproductive system! It's as though they know nothing about how one actually gets pregnant in the first place, or even how their own bodies function. Do you know what I'm talkng about? I just read a post from the 'adolescent' section and this poor girl didn't know that when one has sex for the first time, the girls hymen tears and can bleed afterward. She had no idea, and thought it was her period, or maybe breakthrough bleeding and she was worried about being pregnant. I for one, think the birds and the bees talk should never be avoided, whether it be given by teacher or parent- the issue obviousely needs to be addressed. Your thoughts?

It's gotten to the point, on some days, where it's hard for me to bend over or even walk...but other days, it's just mild pain.  It's hard for me to sit down....most especially when i go to get up.  I guess i'm just worried that i'm not going to be able to walk because it seems like it's only getting worse and i really don't want to be put on bed rest by my third trimester.

It is unusual for me to have this much cm. this is about the same amt. of cm I get before my period and when I am most fertile. My husband and I had sex before I ovulated. and 2 days before that.   The cm I got today was half lotion like and the rest clear cm.    than my husband dropped me off at subway cause he had to get gas and we wanted food so I got my food and waited for him to come back to pick me up. as soon as I sat down I got this burning cramping sensation in my stomach I have never felt before. I had cramping yesterday and the day before but not this bad. I had to go home and rest.   Does this happen after ovulation??

Even before I fell pregnant, my OB/GYN said I'd have to deliver by cesarean because of previous extensive uterine surgery.  That operation was very tough to recover from, and apparently a C-section would be similar except with a baby to care for afterwards.

I hate going anywhere with a stroller and agree that they get in the way but it was early morning and my baby was sleeping. He then "forgot" to put in my order and after sitting for a half hour he laughs and says o yea you're still here. So I got angry, and complained and got free food. I didn't blow up though and say anything to the guy. But I was like he is totally treating me like this because I have a baby. its ridiculous. and its not like I'm those parents who feels entitled that they world bow down to them just because they push strollers around bigger than most peoples cars. I always try to be mindful or others.    and then at the grocery store I'm there in line waiting my children are quite waiting as well. And this 20 year old guy in front of me starts complaining about an expired coupon and trying to make the cashier take it. I was like you're kidding right? so I got angry and told the guy that if he wanted to save 50 cents on bread he should take back his dkny shirt and then come back and buy food he can afford. ANd to get the f off out of the line. Its just total disrespect towards mom nowadays.

She said my "fetus" was keeping my husband from being happy and he doesn't want to be with me anymore, keyed our car, etc. She is mentally insane, and I usually have some sympathy for the mentally ill, but being pregnant I can't deal with her bullshit anymore.

20090309221416AAHkwbc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Myths to make it a boy or girl?	ive heard alot of stupid wives tails about how to make your baby a boy or girl. things like if his sperm is warm its a boy if they are cold it will be a girl. eat this will be a boy and that will be a girl.      if you experience this then its a boy if you develop like that its a girl.      so what have you heard and are there any that a true?       im hoping for a boy im 8 weeks but im not fussed only cuz i got a bet with my partner.
20090309214531AA7c4Cg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are good exercises to do during pregnacy?	im 8 weeks today and want to do exercise so that i don't get fat. i lost 15 kg and have put 6ish of that back on since being pregnant.  i know im going to gain weight but i want to do what i can to minimise it plus i heard exercise can help with the labour and the fitter you are the less likely you are to have complications and the labour will be easier.      so i want to know what people have found to be the best exercises i go to the pool once a week and just make my heart rate rise and exercise my abs. but what else can i do i have heard people say you shouldn't do anything jolty which eliminates pretty much everything.       so what are the shoulds and shouldn'ts of exercising while pregnant?      also would yoga be good? will it help with anything?

20090309211905AAwO4yf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Breast implants and pregnancy?	I had breast augmentation in june of 2007, I am now wondering what will happen, if anything at all, if I was to get pregnant.  I have heard all kinds of remarks from people but nevre anyone who has been through a pregnancy after having the surgery.      When your milk comes in does it hurt worse?  Also does it make them look awful(i know it sounds vain but it was a 8k investment) I am more concerned with pain or having complications because of it.      I can not breast feed (couldnt for all three kiddos) due to a prolactin releasing brain tumor I had back in 2000, so I am aware of that already.      Any help or personal accounts appreciated, thanks a bunch!

20090309221128AAxs5mv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How did your man handle it?	pregnancy???? i am pregnant with my husbands child. we live together in my house and i pay all the bills. I have supported him for the past two years we were married. however, now that i am pregnant, he doesnt do anything. all he ever does his hang with his friends. He leaves me home at night by myself and comes as he pleases. His purchasing power is my platics btw, and he is 22 years old and i am 25.      Another thing he did that got me mad was he asked his parents to lend us money. i told him to take it back cause i worked hard in my life to be successful and i don't need to be helped out. I am just wondering, when my husband will start to take control of things.      ps, my mom wants me to kick him out. but my heart doesnt agree, i still love him and believe he will turn the corner, hopefully soon though.

I have some heart defects and so does my family so my doctor made an appt for me at a bigger hospital but then i was only 17 weeks and they were not able to tell if my baby had a hole in her heart.    is it because i am going to a bigger hospital is that why i will not have an ultrasound at my hospital? I have to go back to this other hospital and have another ultrasound the 17th this month.    do you only have 2 ultrasounds? i have asked my doctor when i had my first appt and they said that they would just wait and see if i needed one.
20090309204218AAafIke	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How much should I charge for a weekend babysitting job?	A few details about the job:      One toddler, from Friday night until Sunday night.     Both parents work and (I'm guessing) make fairly good money.    I usually charge $10/hour- I live in a pretty big city where many sitters charge $12/hr.   Also, I'm an experienced adult, not a teenager.      So anyway, I want to charge a fair flat rate for the weekend, not really charging for the times the child will be asleep.   Thanks for your input!

He is okay during the day about just taking sippy cups. But during the night he will cry and cry till he gets it. Its like his comfort, that and blankets. I feel so awful taking it away from him it breaks my heart. and he WILL not drink the milk at night from a sippy cup. Like today he had one 8oz. cup of milk and thats it so i figured i have to give him a bottle because he needs his milk.    So My question is, it is so bad to give him a night time bottle? I have heard that it messes up their teeth. Have anyone of you experienced that?

20090309211457AAt3Zwp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why do some parents feel that this is okay?	I took my kids to the playground in our neighborhood. There were all these little kids under the age of 5 unsupervised running around jumping off of slides. I was the only adult there. One little boy yelled and cussed at my son  just because my son wanted a turn  and I was like "we don't use that kind of language" "your not even supposed to be alone in the playground where is your mother?" Then I tried to get the kids to stop jumping of the slides, and running up the slides. I used to work as at a daycare but even I couldn't handle this type of situation. I left and took my kids to another playground because I felt that it wasn't my responsibility to watch other peoples kids.   Just the other day me and my husband were driving and we saw a little Girl probably 2 following another little boy (probably her brother)they were both barefooted and walking in the street by themselves. I love little kids but I get so dam frustrated when it is like 8pm and I see little kids  riding their bikes alone. These kids need to be home sleeping. Why don't these parents watch their kids?   **** when I used to work full time I was exhausted but I couldn't wait to get home and play with my kids, read to them. Now that I don't work I get to enjoy every minute with them:)

I have a 5 year old about to be 6 in april....we have always know that he is very smart child, however he is really amazing us sometimes. He started preschhol 1/2 day last year and kindergarden this year..when the y tested him at the begning of K he was past the level they wanted him to be at the end of the year. He can read things that are just amzing to us.......they read in K but very small words...He is reading everything, dish guide on Tv, Signs, posters. Yesterday my husband was putting gas in the fourwheeler with a plastic gas can....he read the words GASOLINE off the side, he read " Do not use near open flame" ect. And yes he comprehends it all. we were told he had ADHD but then the doc called back andsaid heis bored at school not ADHD. He can navigate a computer and internet almost better than us. He can use a DVD player, DVR, anything like that. He can tell you the specific name of almost all sharks and whales and fish...tell you what they eat, where they live, ect. he can easily read words like Octous, elephant...stuff like that without sounding it out...its like its alwasy on the tip of his tounge. He can add and subtract, know s all shapes including the harder ones like octogon, pentagon,hexagon....he wants to know how everything works.....he is a WHY child. Is this normal for his age?

20090309204745AA9e12B	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did Plan B pill work for me? How about for you?	I was no longer ovulating when I had protected (condom broke) sex with my boyfriend 7 days ago.  I took the Plan B pill 6 days ago and today I got my period on time.  It is a normal flow. The box said I may have changes in my cycle so i'm just wondering.  Does that mean that I am not pregnant and that it in fact, worked?       (By the way, I took a pregnancy test 4 days ago and it came out negative.)

20090309205943AAyP7oD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My nephew curses and hits his mom? Advice?	My nephew is 13yrs old. His parents has been divorced for about one year now. He has always been a troubled child though, in our eyes, b/c he was too spoiled. Right now, he's just out of control. He is hitting both his parents, yelling at them at the top of his tongue, cussing at them and calling them all day to just yell at them. He only behaves like this when his parents tell him "no" that he can't get something or he can't go somewhere. Even though the parents have repeatedly told them they can't afford the old lifestyle anymore, the boy doesn't care. My sis in law has asked for my advice. Now, I'm asking for yours. Now keep in mind, he is a 13yr boy, nearly as big as the mom and both parents had been so soft on him since he was born. Help!

20090309212509AAVqWTp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should i let him continue things this way with his daughter?Background info first.Holy novel, I know! Sorry!?	Long story short- I was 19 young and dumb. Met a guy who I knew was already involved with another woman(they weren't married but not that that makes a difference, It was still wrong). I was the other woman. I eventually fell in love with him. He did not want to leave his gf. I felt guilty for loving someone elses life partner after some time and decided to end it. A month later, he called me and asked to see me and like a dummy I said okay. I had already put it in my head that it was over, but as soon as I saw him, I fell weak for him again and we ended up sleeping together that day. Even right after sleeping with him I told him it did not feel right anymore and we agreed not to see each other anymore. Well, later I found out I was pregnant. I told him and his reaction was 'you're ruining my life' and said silly stuff like if its a girl, it's not mine.. All the things young guys say.. He did eventually get 'okay' with me having the baby although in the beginning he wanted me to get an abortion. I was not out to ruin his life with his girlfriend, but I could not abort a child. While I was pregnant, I got the opportunity to move to a different city and start fresh. I told him I was going to move and his reaction was 'no, you aren't really moving' like he didnt see a bunch of boxes around the house. Anyway, I did make plans to move on Sept 1 but on Aug 28, my daughter was born. He was not there when I was in labor but he did come to see her for an hour when I came home with her. I gave him my new phone number and address and he said he would keep in touch. That next week I moved out of the old town and never heard from him again. I called him plenty of times when I took my daughter for doc visits down that way to no avail. For about 3 years. But when she started school, I decided that she needed to have a local doc so I transfered her records here. I never lied to her about him and when she noticed she didn't have a dad like other kids, she asked me and I told her that he lived in a different town and she wanted to see him. I struggled with the fact that I did not want my daughter to resent me for not making a larger effort to contact her dad. But It was also as if I was putting him first instead because I didn't want to ruin his relationship because his gf still had no idea about me or our daughter. My mom and his gf's mom worked at the same place and they had family gettogethers. One year he was there and so were we. He hadn't seen her since she was two days old. She was almost 4 then. He said something like wow she's getting big. I know that was him trying to show interest, but I made a snide comment and walked passed him because I felt like I had done alot of the looking and searching for him and he never returned any of my calls. Cut to another almost 4 years. This past Nov. I found him on myspace. I messaged him and he asked if he could call. He wanted to meet our daughter and get to know her and prove to me that he wasn't the same person he was 8 years ago. And so he came to visit her at our home every weekend for a whole month. He gave me 100.00 although I didnt ask for it. The girlfriend he had had broken up with him the night we talked on the phone because she could not handle the fact that he had another child w/ someone else ( he had a vasectomy last year and has 2 other sons) and they would never have kids together. So the first month was good but when the girlfriend left him but would still call him and 'torture' him with their love, he said he was so depressed. He started not calling for weeks at the time and then He called a week before christmas asking to come down and give her christmas. He came on Christmas eve. We had gifts for my daughters brothers and even for him but he had nothing for Her. He said he wanted to take her to the mall to buy her presents. She told him she did not want his money. So, she didn't get christmas. THe calls from him after that were few and far between. She got really excited to know she had two brothers and that her dad was around, the more he didnt call, the more she wanted to call him. I let her call him. Even offered him our house number so that he could call her when the sitter is here with her while i work til 6 but he insists he doesnt mind calling my phone . But he rarely does. I used to call him the day after he said he was going to call her and didnt.. he would say he forgot or he was busy. Now he's saying that he has a life and that my daughter and I are just going to have to accept that he can't be there for her all that often. He finally did come to see her two weekends ago (first time since christmas eve) and we went to the mall and she finally got her christmas gifts. He mentioned that he and his girlfriend were working things out and that he wanted our daughter to get to know his gf. I didn't think the time was appropriate since she's still getting to know him only 3 months into it. He flipped out and told me that he knew I was jealous of him and h

20090309230548AA4XDA3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do you deal with a stubborn toddler when potty training?	My son is 25 months now and I cannot get him interested in potty training.  He is acting very stubborn about the whole situation.  He gets mad and throws a fit if I even suggest that he use the potty.  I've tried getting him interested in it by decorating it with stickers, watching potty training videos, singing songs about the potty, but still no go.  We tried role-playing with a stuffed animal and that seemed to have a *little* success because he sat on it, but it was short-lived and he never actually used the potty.        He is in pull-ups and he can take them off.  I've even put him in his big boy undies (that he picked out).  Still, he'll go in the floor before getting close to the potty.        I haven't tried to force him or chide him at all as I know that can be damaging and I've heard it wouldn't do any good anyway.        By the way, he is in daycare so I can't work with him throughout the day.  I've asked the daycare to work with him, also, but his teacher tells me he won't work with her, either.        Can anybody help me come up with a way to make him want to use the potty?  I have no idea how to proceed with him.  Thanks!!

20090309231130AA6GwLt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Have you been told you were going to miscarry, but didn't?	This is a bit long, I'll start from the beginning... I started bleeding lightly on friday immediately after sex. It had been a few weeks since the last time I had sex. The blood was a dark red color, and mucousy. It came and went all day on friday and saturday, accompanied by a little bit of cramping. This was a constant vaginal squeesing type of cramp, the kind I always get after sex. I called up the doc on Friday just to be sure I didn't need to get checked, and they said all should be fine, it was probably because I haven't had sex in a while. They let me know I would probably bleed/spot for a day or two, and then after the second day the spotting should turn into a brown discharge. My spotting did stop and turn into brown discharge on Sat.      AND THEN... Sunday I had some more bleeding, accompanied by the same exact cramping again, but this time I had a constant lower back ache. Throughout the day the bleeding got less and less mucousy and brighter and brighter red. Still very light though, I only had to use a panty liner, and changed it about every 2.5 hours or so. I never actually soaked through the liner, just changed it to feel clean. The whole day I felt like I was about to start my period at any moment, so I dragged my butt to the ER to see what was going on.      They checked for infection, came back with a small case of bacterial vaginosis. She checked my cervix and said it was closed. After these were done, I started bleeding a little bit more heavily. They drew blood, said my hormone levels were a bit low. They did an ultrasound and said the amniotic fluid level was low and that "it didn't look like a normal pregnancy at 7 weeks". Right after they did the transvaginal ultrasound I went to the restroom and passed some kind of tissue that was a little bit smaller than a quarter. I was convinced that it was my baby and at this point I broke down and started sobbing. The doc went over the results with me and told me that she saw the clot in the ultrasound and said that it was some kind of tissue from the uterus, not a part of the fetus. She said a miscarriage is about 90% likely. She gave me antibiotics for infection and said to follow up with my doc in 48 hours to check up on things again.      Well, today, the bleeding has been very minimal. It is still bright red in color, but is so minimal i used just a liner, and have barely soaked a total of one.  Since about 5 p.m. I've stopped bleeding all together, and just have a tint of blood left over on toilet paper after i use the restroom. I have been guzzling water down like crazy just in case of that 10% chance I still have the baby. Taking things easy, no cramps at all today! I did have a little lower back ache this morning, but went away by noon. I still have pregnancy symptoms so I just keep praying that everything is okay.       AND THEN... I got a call back from my doc I schedulded a follow-up appointment with just a few minutes before 5 p.m. She said that the on-call physician reviewed all my labs and the u/s. This doc said the ultrasound did not show an intrauterine pregnancy. I was a bit confused by this, I didn't quite know the right question to ask at that time. Anyway, during this conversation the lady basically said that the doc said i had ALREADY miscarried. Wheras the physician in the ER said I was definately still pregnant, but a miscarriage is likely. I'm confused, worried, and hopeful.      Has anyone else been told that they have miscarried, or that they are going to miscarry, but actually carried on with the pregnancy?

20090309230138AAXVCO8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could this pregnancy test be positive?	I took an at home PT about an hour ago. Out of all honesty i didn't take it expecting it to come out positive or anything like that. i found it sitting in my drawer from about a month ago and decided i mays well take it just to see,cause i was gonna throw it away anyway. so i took it and then looked at it 2 mins later and there is a very very faint line that reads positive. i just had my period last month on the 27th, so i am not due to get my period anytime soon.       I was also pregnant last august and had a miscarriage at the end of september. the test i took at the dr office was also very light ( but darker than this one) and they said it was because i was very early into my pregnancy.      so my question is - could this pregnancy test mean the same? could it mean i am pregnant and the line is so faint because i am just really early in my pregnancy? or is it because i took the test at the wrong time and am getting a false positive?      I dont really have any pregnancy symptoms.   The only ones i could think of are that i have been noticing that the area around my nipples look a little darker, but they are not sore.      any advise?      thanks in advance

20090309230337AAR6nEe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is it wrong to make my son sit to pee?	I have serious issues from my past, I was scared to have any children because I knew I couldnt handle my issues if i had a boy. My pregnancy wasnt planned but he's here, now 3 months old and no father. He's growing so fast and that potty training stage will be here before I know it. I dont want him to be made fun of, but I dont think i could handle him standing to pee.
20090309231950AAVYvbc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	When is the right time to tell my son why his dad isn't around?	After I told my boyfriend i was pregnant things started going down hill. He abused me not only physically but mentally as well. Three weeks before my son was born he broke it off, I was fine with it because i was tired of being treated like crap. He didnt like the fact that i was fine with it so he got worse. He called me every second of every day. He wouldnt stop thretening to kill me and take my son after he was born. He was there for the delivery but I havnt let him come near my baby since. My son is now 3months old and i cant stop thinking about when he's going to ask about his daddy, and what ill say. I dont want him to think I kept him from his father, i think i did the right thing but I just dont know.
20090309231243AAoXwrY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why is it so difficult to love someone when the parent neglects her child?	I am a sticky situation. I love this girl to death and I would do anything to be with her; I mean whatever it takes. However, the mom is being such a ***** with everything. She has these past issues and she constantly uses them against me. Even through the pain and suffering, I find myself always stressed and heartbroken because my love for my wife suffers due to her mother constant bickering. Is being too attached a bad thing or is space required when the relationship starts boiling up through parental neglect and verbal abuse.
