Hi, in my area early mornings in winter time may fall to 3° 0r 4° C, and during summer days it may climb to 27° or 28° C, while most of the year the daily temperature ranges from 10° to 22°...    I know that most manufacturers today recommend using 5W-30 all year round, but I've been told by in a good garage that 15W-40 would fit best my needs... I own a Ford Focus 1998.

What optical illusions does it cause toward the occurrence and possible increase of accidents? And by WHAT MEANS are these optical illusions created?   Until today I had not heard of "black ice" - although during the early hours of today there did occur an accident up our road claimed to be an example of black ice causing great confusion.      Could, would anyone tell in detail what this phenomenon is, and by what means it is so indiscernible, YET so especially dangerously treacherous???      Thank you!

20090227153403AAOr0Ss	Cars & Transportation;Aircraft	Lesser of two evils: Overpriced or Overcrowded? Your opinion.?	So I have recently heard that Toronto Pearson International Airport is increasing its passenger fee, and people are really angry about it. Some are saying that it is hundreds of dollars cheaper to drive to Buffalo. Well... I learned from a guest speaker that Pearson is actually coming close to its ultimate capacity (expected in about 4-6 years), and they're running out of room to expand.      So my question: Is it better to charge passengers more so that fewer people use the airport? Or is it better to allow all the passengers and airlines to use Pearson to the point that lines and delays become ridiculous?

20090227152159AAyBrnW	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	How to write a letter complaining to a car dealership?	My husband and I bought a used 2004 Ford F-150 from a car dealership in August of 2008.  We have had to take it back for three different repairs now and have only put 4,000 miles on the truck since we purchased it.  First the driver's side window dropped down in the door, which required a new wiring assembly, etc.  Because we purchased an extended warranty it cost $100 to fix.  Two months later the same thing happened but on the Passenger window, so yet again another $100.  Last week the front passenger brake caliper locked in place while I was going 60 mph on the freeway.  The warranty covered the brake pad and caliper but not the rotor even though it was ruined as a result of the brake caliper failing.  The total cost of repairs and rotor was $335.12.  Upon inspecting the truck we were told that the rear brakes were worn and in need of replacement, another $253.  We were given a verbal estimate that the total repairs were going to be $585.45, but when we picked up the truck it was $617.74.  I give up, I am annoyed that we have put such little mileage on this yet we have had to fork out so much in time and money to fix this thing.  And I would like advice on writing the letter complaining to the dealership.   Also, any advice on how to include the fact that the rear brakes shouldn't have been worn down after only 4,000 miles?

20090227152456AAaHtPL	Cars & Transportation;Safety	A FLOAT struck my vehicle.. problems... help?	so, there was this mardi gras parade with alot of floats, and as i was going home from work, i stopped at a stop light, and btw, i was the 3rd or 4th car to be at the stop light. and then there was this big truck and behind the truck, it pulled a big mardi gras trailer/float. and the trailer/float struck or hit into my left light signal. and the police went and did the report. but i noticed that the weird thing was, the officer never took any photos of the accident..      then few days later, i got the report. it says that "the guy that hit me made a right turn while it was clear and then he noticed that i was coming towards him NOT SLOWING DOWN. and witness stated that i was already making the turn when he hit me..."      major problem is that the witness was part of the family or related somehow, but she was in another car behind the trailer. and they lied. and also the police believed them and not us, there was no camera at the place where we got hit, and no other evidence. it was by a chevron gas station... the guy was white, and im asian. i was thinking, maybe the police sided with the guy who hit me, 1. cause they might be friend or so.. or 2. cause of race ethnicity.. the damage that they cause to my car is about 2100,,      so any advices on what i should do?      and im not just talking bout the money here, im just tryin to fix the problem, the insurance says that they cant do anything now cause the police has already done the report and stuff.... they even said if we go to court then we will definitely loose ...

One day it decided not to start, you turn the key and the engine cranks and cranks and cranks but it won't start.       - I've check the fuel pump, it's operating properly   - I've also put a anti-freeze solution for gas into the tank   - I've removed the pipe that pushes the gas into the fuel injector and it blew a lot of gas out with a lot of pressure.   - I've replaced the Spark plugs, spark plug lines, distributor and the distributor rotor.   - Checked fuses and relays, everything is corrected and nothing is burnt out.   - Replaced current computer with a new one.      It's getting a spark, that I know, I've checked the coil and made sure each spark plug fired before installing it into the engine block.       It's also getting plenty of fuel since there is a strong scent of gas when you check the engine oil dip-stick.       Please someone - make my day and help me solve this mystery! Thanks in advance!

So far i have replaced both calipers, master cylinder, brake booster and both front brake hoses, and previously replaced all but 2 brake lines. I bench bled the master and have bled all of the brakes numerous times with 2 people. I am stumped. The brake pedal is extremely hard when the truck is off but as soon as i start it up it goes to the floor. When i am test driving the back passenger side brake is the only one that locks up when i push the pedal to the floor. I have also tried bleeding out the abs valve and proportion valve. Any ideas would be great because i cant figure it out. Thinking maybe proportion valve because that is all that is left!!   HELP and Thanks

20090225102136AAoU9s4	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Mechanics WTF is up with never standing by timing with repairs?	My Mechanic tells me it's approximately 2 hrs to do the repairs to my car.       I drop it off I ask when I can pick it up. He says noon (which means 4 hours now instead of 2) I say I thought it was 2hrs, he says "well ya but in case we run into a glitch to be safe I will say 12" I say okay...3 hours go by so I call to check up.      I say well I guess you must have ran into a glitch? He says "no..no glitch just other things on the go." He'll call in a few minutes. Well an hour and 15 minutes goes by. No call. I call back, and at 12:15 (remember 12 noon at the latest IF he runs into a glitch) and now he says he is waiting on some part and the car is all apart.       I just tell him fine, I will just go about my day (had plans for the day so asked friend if they would just pick me up) Told him I would just get the car in the a.m. so I could stop waiting around and meet up with my friend. Is this the norm for mechanics? and if so WHY? Please insight guys...

Ich versuche gerade für mein Produkt die Verpackungsgr??en für den Transport zu optimieren.   Jetzt habe ich herausgefunden dass die Europlatte nicht in Schiffscontainer passt, das geht sich in der Breite um ein paar mm nicht aus.   Wie wird das denn gehandhabt? Wird beim Containertransport dann immer h?ndisch umgeladen?   Was ist vernünftiger: die Gr??e des überkartons an die Europalette anzupassen oder an die Innenma?e des Containers.   Das h?ndische Entladen in Europe wird ja recht teuer, in Asien ist das egal.   Mein überkarton ist im Moment: 470x530x380mm und wiegt 27,9 kg.   31,5 kg m?chte ich nicht überschreiten dass dann einzelne Kartons auch noch anders verschickt werden k?nnen, z.b. EMS.

I took the the AT SAT a while ago and barely got well qualified (86) and wasn't selected off the referral list that just passed (the states i picked were GA and FL), so this time i figured i should pick states that aren't so high in demand for a better chance at getting picked up. Any ideas?
20090225102034AAZlDqc	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What should i do ?????	Hi there, i ordered a Brand new Mercedes about 3 weeks ago. The car had to be ordered from the factory because of the extras and they had found a similar car to what i wanted already built but i had an extra 6 cd changer and Dab radio built in which i had not ordered on my car. Therefore the sales woman rang me and said they had found me a car but it had two extras which were a cd changer and DAB radio, she said they cost 500 but they will give them to me for free. Now the car has been delivered to the dealers and all the finance paper work has been signed and the 20,000 cash has been paid the sales person now says i still owe them 550 pounds before i can collect the car for the cd changer which i was told that it was going to be thrown in for free. They say i either pay it and have the car that is delivered or they have to order me a new one from factory and the prices have risen this week for the same vehicle and i would be subject to new prices if i decided to buy the one i ordered previously. What do i do now ? where do i stand ??? i never signed nothing to state that i had ordered a cd changer i have sorted all my insurance and everything on the car which i was supposed to collect on sunday. Could you please advice on where do i stand in this situation ? I really want the car on the 1st but i why should i pay the 550￡ which they told me i dont have to. what could i say to mercedes dealerhip ??       thanks

His lease is up in August, so we figured now is the time to start searching for possible vehicles. We really like both the 2009 Honda Fit and the Scion Xd. Yes, they're both a little silly looking, but we actually like it. So please don't tell me they're ugly or whatnot. What I would like to know is what you guys think about their overall performance, safety, price, and all that good stuff. We test drove a Scion Xd two days ago and we're going to test drive a Fit tonight. My boyfriend wants a manual, if that makes any difference.       Thanks for all of your help in advance! The feedback is appreciated :)
