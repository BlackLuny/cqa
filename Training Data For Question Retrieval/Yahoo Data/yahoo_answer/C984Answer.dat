smcDn76jaa	I think it was a foolish mistake. He was hilarious, a very good wrestler, and he just got his Internet show. They jobbed him out for like a few weeks and then stop letting him show up.

qn50rmQOaa	You're pitching seems real solid. The infield is real nice, assuming Soto has another good year, and DeRosa gets enough play time (that is what I'd watch for). Your outfield is good, and dont be afraid to swap Ibanez for Nady in any situation. He should put up better numbers now that he has a better offense around him.

bNykcEVXaa	EPL is a different kettle of fish... as Scolari proved...<br>  if the players can't cut it.. and don't have the drive, talent and desire... it doesn't matter who the manager is..<br>  <br>  as for Wenger .. GREAT manager.... I respect him more than his success starved own fans do, but since he lost the inherited back 4 (the english SPINE of Arsenal) all those pretty boy talented players can't win anything<br>  <br>  ... Managers manage and players play...  Man Utd win because of their ENGLISH spine... Mouirhino knew that, which is why he didn't want Shev & Ballack.. <br>  <br>  I think this is more wishful thinking on your part.. you just hate man utd ..lmfao and won't give us any credit.  We will be the best for as long as our team remains MOSTLY british.  I THINK A VILLA have proved me right this season, english players are important, even though your foreigners are more talented.?<br>  <br>  as for your comparison of coming 4th with S Korea being better than 1st with Brazil... like Blue B (dodgy decisions and home advantage), I don't agree.. no matter how good the manager... the BEST PLAYERS will win... Chelsea are like S Korea... and Man utd are the Brazil here..<br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  good luck supporting your NEW club...lol <br>  I remember you accused me of sucking up to liverpool fans, when I paid them a compliment... well.. enough said there,mate<br>  <br>  Edit: ? @ TD<br>  <br>  Ps: I think you lot will be lucky to be fighting for 2nd place, lol?(more like 4th place)|`|ojHN65J0aa	"finishing fourth in the world cup with the South Korean team confirmed that"<br>  <br>  WRONG!!!<br>  A bunch of edgy decisions got them there, and teams that host the world cup always, ALWAYS, get a boost in performance.<br>  <br>  "I think he's far superior."<br>  <br>  WRONG!!<br>  Only fools think "any body could win with Brazil".

A trophy would be a nice goodbye present, I only ask that he leaves us in much better shape than when he came.|`|tfotPdeZaa	Well Hiddink definitely will help Chelsea this year very much, but i don't think that it means the end for everyone else. If Hiddink started earlier in the year, then yes. But does he have time to completely fix Scolari's damage? Idk. Also since Hiddink is not going to be Chelsea's manager next year, I don't c too much danger ahead. But you never know, Golden Guus, is and always will be golden :)|`|QVvmmPc4aa	How are ya mate? Well not sure if you noticed but he's got that Mona Lisa expression on his face, like he knows something the cnut! He's a brillant coach no doubt about it. With him, I still think Chelsea will be the ones challenging United for the title.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	and beating stronge favs for euro ,holland. our new boy help tho :).<br>  <br>  he's a great manager,but not too worried just now, he hasnt proved anything yet in england.|`|LoFCv31waa	Sounds like your trying to convince yourself more than anybody else!Time will tell sunshine, time will tell.|`|0HO8sTGeaa	no... fergie still the best in epl... =8~P|`|rfCGWFNcaa	christ id love to be fighting for 2nd place mate....lol.........top bloody 10 would be good enough though...|`|dP37ygplaa	have a look on google for the info you need I think its the best please to start looking|`|nJ5kceMBaa	He says it's only temporary and that there's no way he's managing Chelsea for more than half a season - but I think Hiddink is just saying that to keep his options open. If he does well at Chelsea in the remainder of the season you can bet your life he'll quit the Russia NT. But I don't think that spells doom for the rest of us. Scolari was also brilliant at international level, but 7 or 8 months at Chelsea and he gets the sack. I don't think we should be worried at the moment.|`|TKDi70uTaa	i dont think so. there are some deep rooted problems at cfc the worst being the massive ego's of the players. you can see in a game if it does not go their way after a while certain players lose interest and moan far too much. hiddink will do a job and cfc will get their champs league spot but the title race is over, utd are head and shoulders above everyone. cfc have suffered since clarke went, he had the respect and the ear of every player and i would bet a months wages the zola and clarke will be sitting in the hot seat come the beginning of next season.

AA10848886	I would say anywhere you want to learn.|`|P6Hquaauaa	Where the waves are small, there are NOT a lot of other people out, and it's warm and comfortable.|`|8dNCofeVaa	Really anywhere there is high tide.|`|CyWEam38aa	anywhere there are waves|`|4jSb7ri9aa	That is where you live. If you live near the sea, go! If you leave in singapore and you want to surf in strong wind, go further east. Hope this info is important to you.|`|YFbq4362aa	Andros Island, Bahamas|`|GwkpFs48aa	florida|`|xhPKkkELaa	Where do you live? Or perhaps more important, how far do you live from a beach? You can learn to surf at almost any beach that has waves. There are some truly surf-less spots in the world (and some spots that only have some waves very sporadically, like the Gulf of Mexico). Lessons are the best way to start, unless you are a young adult or adolescent with surfing pals or surfing family members who can teach you . You have to learn surf etiquette (so the experienced surfers in the line up don't want to drown you), how to paddle and take off on a wave, and how to ride a wave. The last thing experienced surfers want is for inexperienced people to just grab a board, rush into the surf and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Go to a real surf shop. The folks there can hook you up with lessons, and even rent you a board to learn on.).  Any resort town, with surf, has at least one decent surf shop, and that's your best starting point.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	<a href="http://photos-p.friendster.com/photos/61/94/63744916/1_275295600l.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos-p.friendster.com/photos/61...</a>
AA10848886	Depends on how good you are if your really bad then no if your really good then yes.|`|YCRIHPJwaa	Well surfing takes at least two weeks to get down the basics. Then after a year you might be pretty good. Also, if the conditions are good you sometimes don't have to paddle that much to catch a wave. Surfing is physically demanding so you have to be able to do push your body up off the board onto your feet in one swift motion. In addition, don't try to go out to far where there are waves to big for your skill level. So overall surfing is kinda hard until you get used to it.|`|aDSuIzuoaa	Not really. It takes alot of practice just like anything does. If someone you know can teach you it would help alot!! I learned when I was younger and have not surfed in about 2 years and the time before that it had been like 3 years and I sucked! I needed someone to teach me all over again!! And I grew up doing it when i was little!!|`|CyWEam38aa	define easy|`|o1wrdVwoaa	Surfing is kind of a challenge <br>  It is not very hard to catch a wave, <br>  but it's hard to stand up. It definitely <br>  takes some practice and balance. <br>  If you get a beginners board that makes<br>  it easier.|`|xhPKkkELaa	You didn't tell us very much about you, so we really don't know exactly how hard is might be for you. Snowboarding, wakeboarding etc.help  with balance, but otherwise, have noting to do with surfing. Surfing is an ocean sport, that should only be practiced by persons who are already competent ocean swimmers. Swimming in a pool is neat, but it's not ocean swimming, with undertows, rip tides and sometimes BIG waves. I have seen lots of great pool swimmers get rescued. So, my first tip on how to surf is to be at home in the ocean. It doesn't matter if you can snowboard, it matters how well can you swim in a rip current in overhead waves.There are way too many dangerous people in the water now (especially the ones who THINK they can surf). They are a danger to themselves and other surfers, don't join their ranks.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the best way to start, unless you are a young adult or adolescent with surfing pals or surfing family members who can teach you . You have to learn surf etiquette (so the experienced surfers in the line up don't want to drown you), how to paddle and take off on a wave, and how to ride a wave. The last thing experienced surfers want is for inexperienced people to just grab a board, rush into the surf and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Go to a real surf shop. The folks there can hook you up with lessons, and even rent you a board to learn on.). Just work on your basics, but don't rush into anything. Beginners shouldn't even think about buying a surfboard. Either rent a board to learn on, or use one provided by your instructor. After you learn to swim and master the ocean, get your REAL advice from a surf shop. However, if they think you are just a 'kook' tourist out to rent a board, you won't necessarily get the best attention. <br>  <br>  Most people learn best on long boards, although I have seen lots of surfers start on a short board and master it. In the long run, there are NO RULES on what type of board you have to learn on. Long boards are ideal for learners. There are also good internediate length boards to learn on, funshapes, mini-mals and some hybrids. That is why instructors use long boards or fun boards (or even softtops). A board has to be bouyant enough to float you well enough for you to paddle and take off on a wave. A surfer's board preference depends on three things: Their size (what will float them), Their skill level (beginner to advanced) and the type of waves usually encountered at their local breaks.<br>  <br>  If you are fairly athletic, after a couple lessons (either formal or from pals who surf), you should be able get a good grasp on the basics. But you really need to be comfortable in the ocean, first. And be careful about what you read on line here. Some of these young folks may not know any more about surfing than you do! And, sharks, are not an issue, but you can read all about that on the resolved YA surfing questions.<br>  <br>  THE REAL BOTTOM LINE IS: Go to a Surf Shop, not a computer. I have been surfing since 1966 and I get my surfboard advice at good local shops at the places where I surf. The pros there can give you the right answers!! <br>  <br>  Good luck.

Do you skateboard, snowboard, wakeboard or anything like that where you have practiced using your balance. Surfing can be tricky and I would say for the most part it's not easy. You should learn though, it's the coolest feeling in the world.

r5AMG8g7aa	Timing can be several things. It can relate to when you move verses the movement of an opponent. It can also relate to the timing of different muscle groups that interact in a specific move. An example of that is the basic punch done in most karate styles. The punch actually states with the hips moving. A perfect punch involves the perfect coordination of the hips, then shoulder, then arm. Proper timing allows you to transfer maximum power as a flow of energy from the hips to the fist.<br>  <br>  NOTE: see the answer I gave in your other question about dealing with an opponent that has faster hands.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Proper technique requires proper timing in the execution. Depnding on what your going for. <br>  <br>  Aka an offensive/incomming punch / kick, for you to hit the proper nerves, joints throws, will require timing on your part of when and how to react, or when to move in our out. <br>  <br>  Parry or block, counter or not, and when. if you wait too long, or go too soon, you wont connect properly<br>  <br>  Not to knock you but, Honestly bro, if you need to ask for your blackbelt test, your not ready for it.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	Timing has several different applications.  One is putting the technique on the desired target even though he/she may be moving.  Judging your distance is an important aspect and if your opponent is moving closer you may also have to shorten the technique.  Timing in relation to fakes and combinations means throwing the fake at the proper speed from the proper distance and it being a believable technique to your opponent and then also following with the real technique once your opponent has reacted.  An example of this might be me faking high to get your hands up to hit you low when your hands are somewhat low to start with.  If I follow the fake to quickly with the body shot your hands and arms might still be in low and in the way so you can do some combinations in conjunction with fakes and feints to fast.<br>  <br>  Timing is all important with regards to position and foot work.  The ideal situation is to have yourself in the right spot, putting your techniques on the target even though your opponent is moving or avoiding them.  This way you keep them on the hook and it forces them to rely on their defense and more easily keeps them on it.  When I fought full-contact I would sometimes wheel around so that my opponents lead side (usually their left) was along the ropes and the edge of the ring.  This made it harder for them to throw their lead leg round house or lead side leg kicks as the two lower ropes would be in the way.  A good exeperienced fighter won't stay there for very long but if you are smart, agile, and quick on your feet you can set them up that way and take advantage of them.  Another example is getting them to follow you a little and then catching them at the optimum distance coming in which will make your shots more powerful much like two cars colliding head on.  Two cars going 30 mph colliding head on is equal to the force of a car going 60 mph and hitting a stationary car.|`|Ptfetyulaa	well, if u dont care about timing, u might miss the enemy and get...well....u know. answer that the concept of timing might lose the battle for you. i dont know how to say it in any other way.|`|c73AAq22aa	to get your puches and kicks in for them to be effective<br>  and cuz you dont  want to be sloppy
1f433eb699e3657ce23414944304abdbaa	If you are in a state of no mindedness (Mushin), effective technique could look like anything.  Regardless what it physically looks like, the technique should be appropriate, spontaneous, well timed and completely natural.<br>  <br>  In other words, its not necessarily a listed technique, but an effective RESPONSE.<br>  <br>  The techniques are just tools we use to learn principles and concepts.  The expression of these concepts without regard to the boundaries of technique is where the art in what we study is seen.  Mushin is the state of mind where this expression of principle is possible.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Mushin is the process of no thought there for your technique reacts without hesitation and through instinct.

GLKsMrYLaa	This feeling you have is called the Flight and Fight response, it happens to me a lot and it's to do with your brain. When your mind senses a bad or dangerous situation it will trigger into Fight or Flight and will pump Adrenaline into your muscles but if you don't use this adrenaline it can make your muscles tired which is the cause of the shaking. Also even if you do use the Adrenaline it can still make you shake which is still very unpleasant. <br>  <br>  I get this very often and it feels like I can't move and I almost feel paralized but it's different for other people, but this is nothing to worry about, it's perfectly normal. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-fl...</a><br>  <br>  The link should explain it in more detail. <br>  Have a good evening!|`|CHCPnvksaa	Yes it was the adrenaline coursing through you that made you shake. It puts you into "fight or flight" mode". I got into a fight in HS when some girl went after me, and the same thing happened. It can cause you to kind of black out too, to where you body is functioning on the adrenaline. I found out after my fight that I punched the football coach and floored him when he tried to pull me off her.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	could be "super human strength" or maybe anxiety|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Would be the rage building up in you because you were annoyed that these jokers were picking on your mates. Turns into adrenalin which then gives you the strength to fight. As an anxiety sufferer I experience this daily as the fear from anxiety also causes this reaction, also know as the 'fight or flight response'. I guess if someone did attack me I would be ready for them! haha|`|STLS9XXYaa	i grow up in the tough streets of the bronx ny wen i was 17 to 20 i used to fight almost on a daily basis. at least weekly. and still i get all shake<br>  up before a fight.|`|Q7QID49Kaa	of course its normal if you are willing to fight you are not a coward <br>  <br>  shaking just means ur human and u have fear<br>  <br>  oh and if you do fight shake their hand before lol|`|c73AAq22aa	yes its normal too if you dont get into fights mcuh<br>  unless you get in a lot of fights you wont feel it no more.<br>  <br>  just breath take it easy|`|gUMHWrjMaa	for my 2cents worth in answer to question No1...:<br>  <br>  your body would shake from all the hormones running throught your body, such as adrenaline preparing you for the fight. it's your bodys way of getting you ready to fight whoever it is.<br>  <br>  for question no.2, im not too sure, i assume adrenaline plays some part, but it would also (deffinatly) be many more things, such as a mental attitude towards the situation. i have also heard stories similar where a mother has lifted the front of a car of her child and such like.  arenaline would play a part,in this, but i know there would be much more than this for something like that to happen.|`|SpFRdFJ2aa	when i get into fight i shake also.... sometimes is because im ready to fight and im so so so freakin mad!!! thats why i shake and i  think is normal it just happens to me all da time and not because im scared!|`|wtzCUZ3eaa	It's normal, I don't shake when I'm wrestling with buddies, but during a fight I will a lot. Sometimes you're angry or anxious or both. All the adrenaline should give you more strength though so use it!

5BQM1hTTaa	I agree that the Knicks will be an overall better team.  With that impressive win over the Spurs, the second half is looking a lot better.

You read my mind perfectly!!!|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up are you a psycho,<br>  <br>  First- Laker fans do not hate the Cetlics because of their "attitude".  They hate the Celtics simply because that's a part of being a Laker fan.  I would expect Celtics fans to hate the Lakers and their fans as well.  This is as simple as:  Duke/Carolina, UCLA/USC, Ohio St./Michigan, Packers/Bears, Dodgers/Giants, (need i go on?)  We don't like the Cetlics because they are our biggest rival and to be a Laker fan is to grow up not liking the Celtics.<br>  <br>  That being said.  Kobe i think is definitely an athlete who is very polarizing and in many ways misunderstood.  Laker fans to not claim him to be flawless and with Kobe truthfully you take the good with the bad- but the good is so much that you can live with some of the bad.  Yes Kobe is sometimes selfish, over the top, and a little cocky.  But that same desire to win- is what makes him able to do things that very few people in the history of the game can.<br>  <br>  So while Kobe has matured over the years- you can say OK fine he's always been a bit of a 'pre-madonna', he's always been a little spoiled, he's always not been the "best teammate" but he's lived up to the hype and he's a heck of a basketball player.<br>  <br>  The Celtics who were dormant for many years- were basically handed a gift from one of their former players Kevin McHale dealing with Danny Ainge and the Celtics have become quite cocky since winning their ring.  K.G. who was a humble respectable guy all those years in Minnesota- is all of a sudden mouthing of, putting fingers in people's faces, Paul Pierce who was basically the East's equivalent of a Carmelo Anthony (puts up great numbers) but couldn't lead his team to wins or any-where past the first two rounds of the playoffs (all of a sudden declares himself the best in the world) and the Cetlics have just been popping off at the mouth.  As a Laker fan it just adds fuel to not like the Celtics- but the truth is - even if they were quiet, humble, etc. because i'm a Laker fan i don't like the Celtics period!  And i don't even need a reason any better than simply that i'm a Laker fan to not like the Celtics!  So you're "conjecturing" is a bit circular and if you're going to accuse Laker fans of being "hypocrites" for hating the Celtics- you have to understand what it means to be a fan of a particular team.  Those things you mention are just additional reasons to not like the Cetlics- but i've always hated the Celtics since becoming a Laker fan- though i do have a tremendous amount of respect for the organization and what they mean to the history of basketball- but honestly not a lot of respect for this particular group of Celtics.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|KTp27Fokaa	There's no such thing as a Celtics fan. There are Celtics "fans" though|`|dDhTMacAaa	it's just a reason they give because the real reason has to do witha b 30-point Finals blowout|`|ur1bnkrZaa	ha rondo looks like a transvestite. garnett never acted all crazy when with the wolves. now he is all cocky with the most cockiest team in the league. the whack celtics.<br>  man i cant wait to see the celtics in the playoffs with flopping pierce and alien head allen.<br>  <br>  f*** the celtics. <br>  I LOVE LA more then my man Randy Newman.<br>  24 mvp|`|9UhoUcM2aa	If you asked me who has the worst attitude.. I would NEVER say Kobe Bryant.. <br>  <br>  and I said that I dont hate the celtics but I'm sick of their attitudes..<br>  yea they may be the champs right now.. but this year.. the Lakers will be Champs!...and hopefully it will shut their mouths..because they are tooo cocky.|`|0eMQDINbaa	Neither team is perfect. Both of your teams have arrogant players on them. But overall Kobe has matured much more and isn't as arrogant as he was in previous years.|`|sd5ktP8taa	he differently doesnt have the worst attidude|`|l0iCqzlQaa	cuz you would know right Nick C, get your head out of your @$$|`|NEtVRjplaa	If my opinion counts to you, I don't agree.<br>  <br>  I think that KG does have a bad attitude. Come on, he got on his knees and barked at another player... you don't find that disrespectful or suspect to say the least? He waved his finger in Calderon's face and threw a sucker punch at another player. I'm not saying he's not a good player, that would be stupid of me to make that claim. But he's got a bad attitude and there's nothing "funny" about it.

Remember last year, they gave that guy 58 million. I can't even remember his name.  But what do you expect from the Raiders? Good decisions?|`|AA12375576	Absolutely.  He is no Champ Bailey.  While he is a solid corner this money makes no sense to me at all.

xSv6JJ1Zaa	If you are looking to build muscle, but are serious about swimming, just try to focus on muscles that are used during swimming. For example, working biceps will slow you down, not only because you don't use your biceps in swimming (or almost any other sport) but because it tightens your arms and shortens your stroke.|`|Fe15PkS7aa	no it doesn't you need more muscles to pull yourself through the water and dive so the more muscle the better
YrxLbfiIaa	This is like the Chevy verses Ford argument ---- I happen to like American made firearms so prefer and own Remington's......<br>  <br>  The Remington 700 is a decent rifle and surely you would not be disappointed owning one -- Mine has been a pleasure to use....|`|WBGnXsr7aa	Definitely Remington a tried and true rifle|`|xOReEw6Waa	You can't do wrong with either choice only because the Remington has good  value in it's many offerings and the Tikka has a good value for the ergonomics and the Sako Barrel.For the level both rifles are at the quality is slightly better for the Remington because the Remington models are more "old school" manufactured than the Tikka. Not to fault the Tikka at all because I do plan on getting one for my son, but all the manufacturing processes they use are the same reason the Tikka is affordable. It is easier to free float a barrel in a production rifle then to custom bed it, and the recoil lug positioning and support is important. Both the Remington and Tikka use streamlined methods but since Tikka is more LEAN manufacturing oriented currently they use the quicker assembly processes. Again, nothing wrong with that but some reviews have mentioned that aspect. <br>  <br>  Most reveiws would place the rifles equally for hunting use in accuracy and reliability. I do prefer the Tikka because it provides features and ergonomic feel that I appreciate in my Browning A-Bolts.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	I don't know a lot about tikka but i have seen then in some sporting good stores and they look like a good gun. But you can't go wrong with a Remington 700. I have four Remington firearms a 870,1100,700adl,and a model five 22cal. Every Remington i have shoot well and have lasted a long time.|`|QNX9NET3aa	Both are very good guns. The Tikka has a 60 degree bolt lift vs 90 degree on the Remington. It will give you more clearance between the scope and your hand. The Tikka bolt is one of the smoothest around.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Get both, then you can tell us.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	To be brutally honest, unless you plan on doing some long distance (250yd+) hunting, the majority of it is what goes on south of the trigger.  Yes, A Remington 700 will be a much more accurate rifle and last longer in the right hands, but you will also pay extra for that.  If you are looking to put meat in the freezer and are like a majority of us, any of those will do just fine.  Just get some quality optics and lots of practice.|`|EGKeYd0Waa	Remington 700 hands down American legend. preferably .30-06|`|2XusVa4jaa	Go with the Remington! They are the best!!!!

They don't have a big man to compete with Pau or Bynum.  We also beat them without Bynum on their home court.  Lakers in 5, maybe 6.<br>  <br>  If they play Boston, I see it going 7, and whoever has homecourt wins.  I think if Bynum is healthy, Lakers can win in 7, whoever has homecourt.

H8u7gMAYaa	Fitz definately. He is more athletic, stronger, as quick, probably better hands.|`|vtYRw2yWaa	Fitzgerald is going to be the best WR of all time. Randy Moss can only catch if Brady is throwing to him.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Larry Fitz is much better!  Younger, more talent, better stats.|`|MbcvI1A9aa	larry fitz. cant remember the last time he wasnt in the pro bowl.|`|AOA8TJraaa	Randy Moss is, he didn't have an all planet Quarterback throwing to him.<br>  <br>  Larry Fitzgerald, outstanding leaper, exceptional speed for a wide receiver, great young superstar, great awareness.It's easy to say Fitzgerald is right now. Nobody was talking about this subject before the playoffs. Let me be clear: I think Fitzgerald is a very good receiver and certainly one of the best. But I think that Randy Moss is the best receiver. You can't stick to Moss one-on-one.<br>  <br>  I do remember Rodney Harrison playing against Fitzgerald during his rookie season. I was impressed of Fitzgerald, for a big man, he was very athletic, very quick. And he ran really good routes. He's really good at catching the ball at its highest point. He has all of the small little habits that make a receiver really good.<br>  <br>  Fitzgerald has been really good this postseason, having the best postseason of anybody in NFL history. But right now, I think that guys like Moss, Andre Johnson and even Chad Johnson are among the best. That's not to say that Fitzgerald isn't in their class, because he is. I want to see him do it consistently along with guys like Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne.If he does this next year, then yes, I think he could be the best. He has a Pro Bowl receiver on the opposite side. He has an all-planet quarterback throwing him the ball. And he's in the playoffs right now, so everybody is watching what he's doing. But we can't get too "fast food" about it -- don't make a snap decision about it just because it's the playoffs. We need to slow down.His size is what really sets him apart. He has that great size like a lot of the other top receivers -- Terrell Owens, Randy Moss and Plaxico Burress. Those guys are freaks. They all have that size to make mismatches with defensive backs. Fitzgerald is also good at attacking the football -- fighting off the other guys to make the play.<br>  <br>  Moss didn't necessarily have an all-planet Kurt Warner throwing to him this season. He had a backup but he was pretty good, but not as much as Warner. Randy Moss is a better jumper, he is faster, and he is a better catcher. I am personally a fan of Moss too but Fitzgerald is also great. There size is what really gets them the big plays. Moss holds one of the best receiving records of all time. He has the most Touchdown Receptions in a season. He had 23!!! That's more than Jerry Rice's who held the record. I think Moss's abilities makes him the better receiver.|`|U3KAgO0baa	IMO Fitz is the best PLAYER in the NFL Bar NONE!<br>  He is Better at his Postition than anyone Else in the NFL is at Their Position...

Do you think Vince wants a part in their biggest competition? [They are not going to take over WWE and aren't competition at all, but they're the next thing out there] Why talk about them. It's promoting them. TNA talks of WWE in negative ways. They're fools. They're giving WWE publicity. People realize that they're watching crap and hear WWE and go, I'll watch that. They don't get that by mocking WWE, people think they're jealous tarts. Even TNA fans know, it'll never be better. WWE production value is better. Their roster is better, and their diva's are hotter. It's more entertaining. No comparison. I hope Vince buy's TNA, and just fire's every superstar, so it'll just be gone. It's like they're a little spec of dust, that get's in your eye, and pisses you off.|`|5j81EoVXaa	tna want a rivalry to boost ratings but wwe already has a good fanbase so they dont need one|`|cuCRG8FNaa	tna is trying wwe is so much better it wont happen|`|frz0AUeHaa	wwe will win any day

Judo (which was developed from jujtisu as a sport) was introduced to Brazil by Mitsuyo Maeda in the early part of the 20th Century. Maeda met up with Gastao Gracie, patriarch of the Gracie family, who took up judo and then developed BJJ, increasing they focus of the art more ground fighting.<br>  <br>  (I didn't actually mean Gastao took up judo!

nxymxSUFaa	I don't think I'd want to play in such places like Miami or Seattle or Pittsburgh.  Cities like these are not really baseball crazy.  Once upon a time Pittsburgh was during the days of Roberto Clemente and "We are Family" in the late 70's but not anymore.  If not for the Steelers who knows what those poor souls would do.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the lack of media attention and fan interest would definitely effect me as a player.  I think a player needs positive feedback in order to play at their best.<br>  <br>  The ultimate for me would be to play in New York for the Yankees.  I would welcome the challenge.  If I didn't get the job done it would be my fault, not the media or the fans.|`|PkCqIfMFaa	Well, I am a Red Sox fan, and I just love everything about Red Sox baseball. The fans are always on your side, unless you are just terrible. Every game is like a playoff game and is so intense. Intensity and drive is what keeps players playing at the highest level they can. The media will not bother you if you do not want them too, but obviously you are an absolute celebrity being a part of the Red Sox. I don't choose the Yankees because I am a Red Sox fan, and I like Boston more than New York :).|`|utTFiz3gaa	I would love to play for a good city like St Louis or i would want to play for the Twins (Minneapolis).

This is where careers come to die.|`|CkZrQVEGaa	well any big team like the mets,red sox,white sox,cub,yankees<br>  i remember in the alcs sox fans boo'ed david ortiz<br>  yankee fans booed a-rod<br>  phillies fans are the worse though|`|lp4wajLxaa	I think it's pretty unanimous that it would be New York (Bronx).  Their fans will boo anybody and their media is ruthless.|`|AA10943884	Kansas City for obvious reasons|`|h074DM42aa	St. Louis, hands down.<br>  <br>  Now asking the other way around: Philadelphia.|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	Philadelphia|`|d1cjF4Plaa	New York Yankees because they get REALLY INTO it! But then again, the Yankees are one of the best...|`|he3Od6owaa	dODGERS|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	I wouldn't want to play in New York or Philadelphia|`|vuh0i3Axaa	toronto|`|qoYLjfxvaa	Queens, NY.<br>  <br>  Those fuckers booed Johan Santana in his first game.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I would not want to play in either New York or Boston because of the harsh media and fans. Yes, they have three of the best teams in baseball, but their fans are unruly.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Pardon my french, but to that I say, "F*ck that, pay me!"  Sooner or later the fans will come ala Tampa.  Hell no I wouldn't play in NY or PHI.  The city of brotherly love has the worst fans.  They seem to forget that baseball is a team sport and one player cannot win a World Series.  Sure if I made 20 mill I would be expected to show up big in the playoffs, but again, I'm just one player and I'm not batting 9 times an inning.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I wouldn't want to play for the Yankees.  I mean, everyone knows how the fans can be if you aren't playing well and they seem to look for things you do wrong.  You're also under a microscope and can't even go out without the paparazzi following you.<br>  <br>  On top of that, I just cant stand Yankee fans.  I mean, like the Yankee fans who say things like no other team counts, that we shouldn't even play the season because they should just be given the WS, etc.  Living near NY, you get to see the worst of Yankee fans, and I wouldn't want to be playing to make those people happy.|`|KTp27Fokaa	San Diego, judging by the way the fans of their football team act. They hate your team if they aren't good, but are there to brag when you're winning. I hate that so much.|`|c3tADklmaa	I don't want to play for a city with a small misjudgement can lead to an infamous career. So I'll pick the Angels since they're always nice.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	New York and Los Angeles!
PLxRiyLsaa	I would let him enjoy his meal because he is human just like everyone else. After he has finished his meal then I would walk up to him nicely and ask him may I have your autograph. I think that it is rude to bother him while they are eating.|`|YjTU7Psyaa	say hello and let him be. He would be annoyed if you asked for an autograph and it might cause a scene and unwanted attention. It would be hard not to ask for an autograph though. Maybe ask to take a picture or take a picture of them so you an leave them alone. Either way, I wouldn't want to annoy him or make him feel uncomfortable.|`|5m9An5rTaa	I would say hello and leave it at that. I would hate to be bothered while I was out with my family. I met Dan Marino in Tampa this year at a Superbowl function. He was being hounded as he got out of his motor home by several fans who were trying to get his autograph. You could tell that he had several thing going on at the time so he all but ignored them. I say him about 3o minutes later and said hello to him. He saw that I had a football in my hand and asked me if I would like his autograph.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I don't know if I would really do anything. I think it is really annoying to bother people when they are eating. But I wouldn't be able help it, I would stare. Which could be even more annoying then talking to him. Maybe if I was able to catch him while he was leaving, I would ask for a pic and autograph.|`|xND578cNaa	if he's still eating, i'd rather wait for him to finish eating before asking for an autograph...<br>  that's what you call respect which, based on how i observe the world, is quickly fading|`|9C6KvSAkaa	I am such a chicken, I'd probably just look from afar, lol. Once at a Laker game Kareem Abdul Jabbar was standing in front of me before the game started and I couldn't get myself to go up to him.|`|mml9J88caa	Well first i would order whatever he is eating... jk. <br>  <br>  i probably wouldn't ask for his autograph. at the most i would just say good luck next season. hope you do well. and leave it at that :)|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	I would let him be. When out with his family or friends he should be able to relax without me interrupting his steak dinner.<br>  <br>  Ryan Braun - have a few already, and one personal signed auto to me from when I bought my car.|`|OXleDYVQaa	"Player"???  I guess I might be confused?<br>  <br>  Heck the Cowboys ask me to lunch in the locker room all the time, in season.<br>  <br>  Dallas|`|ad3M8wViaa	I already have his autograph so no need for another, but I would go talk to him if he wasn't with someone else.|`|hQECmFKOaa	Of course you have to ask him for his autograph because then he knows that he has fans.|`|9YmjPsdqaa	Absolutely, but I'd buy him a beer for his troubles.|`|7Ohs5ABCaa	No, I am not a prick and will let the dude enjoy his meal.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I'd say hello and ask for his autograph. If he declined, I'd just tell him "I understand. Have a good day."|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	All of yall r shytin me like u wouldnt ask for his autograph <br>  <br>  1st off if hes a real good player thell be tons of ppl on him anyways. Id ask for jose autograph.|`|xIfvXy4waa	I am a very obnoxious person lol. First I would probably get all starstruck and have a panic attack. Then I would run up to them and be like "OMG I LOVE YOU!" Lol, my dad is real classy and would just wave, so I am always embarrasing him about stuff like that.|`|AA10554783	Yes i met Jim Brown in Detroit at a club and sat right next him. i got his auto and we said a few words, the lady he was with was kind of annoyed.|`|KTp27Fokaa	considering that many other people would be surrounding this player, I probably wouldn't even approach him.|`|c3tADklmaa	Say hello, talk baseball, and an autograph. Anythings possible in Y!A!!!!|`|utTFiz3gaa	i have thought of this plan numerously and carefully (i get bored from time to time and i think of these master plans of what i am going to do when i see so and so at such and such place at a certain time. I'm weird like that okay? geez, like you haven't had those kinds of thoughts before? ^^)<br>  <br>  okay so if i am in a restaurant and i see a favorite player and he is NOT busy i would say say hello and introduce myself (very nervously although they are just another human being lol) maybe talk some baseball and then wish em luck in the season or in the game. I think conversations are more meaningful than autographs and pictures. They're people i am a person i wouldn't want to bother them that much<br>  <br>  if he WAS busy eating and talking with someone i would write a small note on a piece of paper or a napkin (i would write something along the lines of "hi i'm mimi and i am the girl in the green sitting right in back of you and i think you are awesome! thanks!" , signal the waitress/waiter and tell them to give it to him and say that it was from me to him; its terribly rude to go up to them when they are eating not to mention awkward and i think a little note wouldn't be all that bad <br>  <br>  and you know what? i wouldn't even have to talk to them i'd just tell the waitress to give em the note and then i'd leave.. (its partly because i'm very shy or i don't want to bother them at all) so they would at least know one person appreciates him lol :)<br>  <br>  maybe i would ask him if he  wanted a piece of my cheesecake.. (yes i will be eating cheesecake when i meet someone even remotely famous rofl!)|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I'd just let them be.  I don't think I'd even say hello.  They have the right to be able to go out and have a night on the town without being bothered by every Tom, Dick and Harry that bumps into them.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	While he's eating? No. That's just the wrong time to bother someone. Try to wait around and ambush him as he's leaving, if you must. Otherwise just toss him a "hey, good luck tonight" as you pass by.|`|yk4S7uuraa	No, I wouldn't, not when he's eating; thats not the time or place for it.<br>  <br>  If you want an autograph, do it in or outside of the stadium, not on their personal time.|`|5yZICXImaa	I would hope I was wearing my Roy Halladay shirt and ask him politely if he would autograph it. Then tell him he does a great job at pitching.|`|aUyopOWiaa	If I had the courage, I would just say hello and let him be.|`|AA10349169	I would say hi, I would not interrupt their dinner|`|9ntoGPFyaa	I'd just say hello and let him be. im not overzealous

There were many rumors floating around and the Cavs had several players on their radar (the hottest rumor being Antwan Jamison of the Wizards).

WwrCYF1kaa	Run.<br>  Tis the only way. Running out doors is far more fun than the treadmill. I can just about manage 15 mins on a treadmill but can run a marathon far easier.<br>  <br>  Visit a website like runners world; asics for marathon training plans.<br>  <br>  There is plenty of advice on running marathons, esp for first timers. You don't have to have run a full 26.2 miles beforehand. 20 miles or approx 3 hrs on your feet will get you through. You need to start slowly and build up your distance by 10% each week. NO MORE, you will hurt yourself. It needs to be a gradual progression. Build in hills very gradually, London is flat so you don't need steep hills. London is tarmac, try and do the bulk of your training on tarmac. Be aware of cambers on the roads you run on, alter which side of the road you run on if there is a steep camber otherwise you may injure yourself unwittingly. Each time you increase your distance walk the extra miles the first time then jog them then run them. <br>  <br>  Plan your route well. Make it interesting. Take music if you need to. try different types of energy; gloucose tabs; gels; sweets. Find the one that suits you.<br>  <br>  At the gym work your legs; bench press, lunges, etc. Then rest your legs. Make sure that you work your legs evenly.<br>  <br>  There is so much advice out there you may feel a little overwhelmed but in all honesty, just try to run, build milage gradually, don't over push yourself. You have plenty of time to train.<br>  <br>  Oh and do enter some shorter races before hand, it will help you to learn how to run a race. First race I ever ran was my worst. It was the hottest day of the year, I hadn't the first idea of what to expect, my mind body and soul rebelled. It was as much as I could do just to get around. You'll need to know how you react to the race situation. Once you can run 15 miles with ease then enter a half. Don't run to win, just run to see what it feels like. See how many miles you need to run before you start to feel comfortable and loose. Lots of things to learn.<br>  <br>  It's never advised to run at race pace while training. If you are finding your training pace to easy then up it a bit for a short distance, then back down, then up it again until you feel comfortable with this new pace.<br>  <br>  Do not worry if your training feels slow. Do not worry about not making the distance. The key to training is to take it slowly to avoid injury. Over stretching yourself is a surefire way to hurting yourself.|`|ed377f9dc2958771e37512095f53f6bbaa	You get points off the bat by starting off wisely.  April 2010 is a realistic goal, giving yourself plenty of time to get into marathon shape. <br>  <br>  The key is running.  You want to establish a base - where you're running about 30-35 km a week.  But get there slowly!  Start off running 3 km three times a week.  As you feel stronger, increase the distance of those runs, then add additional days of running.  And when you have three or four 3-4 km runs down, add a long run into your routine.  Your long run may start off at 8-10 km.  <br>  <br>  OK, so you have your base.  In October, you're going to extend that to into your marathon training plan.  You'll find a zillion on line, and no one is necessarily better than others.  But almost all follow the same outline:  shorter runs during the week, and a long run on the weekend.  As you approach race day, your long run will be 35-40 km!  (It seems impossible now; in six months, you'll look forward to it!)  You'll see plans that include hills, tracks and fartleks.  I'd not incorporate these until you get the first marathon under your belt.  <br>  <br>  Strategy: Find friends to run with.  They get you through the tough spots, and if someone's waiting for you you have to show up.  Run this first race just to finish, not to break any speed records.  Instead, after you conquer your first marathon, think of what worked, what didn't, and prepare for the NEXT one!<br>  <br>  If something hurts, stop running and try again another day.  And it's perfectly all right to walk some days if you get tired during an outing. (Oh - be sure you have good running shoes.)<br>  <br>  Finally, if you ask four runners for advice on a marathon, you'll get six opinions.  Do what works for you.   And kick butt on your marathon. <br>  <br>  And really finally:  the Flora Marathon fills up immediately, and by lottery.  Monitor the site so you'll have your registration in as soon as possible to secure your spot at the starting line.|`|I8OuZilqaa	What i would do is practice running 1 or 2 km more than you need to for the race, so when you are at the marathon its easy for you. If you dont want to run on the treadmill try running outside.|`|qqdvP54Paa	this site has a pretty good basic overview of how to train for a marathon: <a href="http://www.marathontrainingadvice.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.marathontrainingadvice.com</a>|`|Mo201H1Maa	i've also done the half marathon, and it was the first time in 5 years that i tried running more than, like, 6 km... i practiced by just giving one month of regular running before the race... like 5-6 km each time... i didnt really bother controlling my diet... i was able to run like 13 km in the race without stopping... but thats when my legs gave away...<br>  i guess more running practice and not eating too much heavy/fried/oily food could've helped!<br>  <br>  to the edit: i say, start off at a comfortable pace, and then speed up over time... for me, the worst thing has been stopping in the middle of the run, because getting to your pace again is difficult after that... so its better to stay slow if you have to in the beginning instead of wearing yourself out.

DXV0A1haaa	ra64t34  is pretty much right, except that contact patch is more a function of width than diameter. So, if the rolling diameter of the rubber is the same, as it usually should be, going to a wider rim is a bigger cornering benefit than going taller unless you're running a big soft sidewall profile.  <br>  <br>  A 19" rim will force a lower sidewall profile like he said, which helps with cornering stability.  Most larger rims though, come with a huge weight penalty.  And for the most part, any rim much bigger than a 17" is usually all for show and heavy as hell.  If performance matters to you at all, never buy any rim that weighs more than the ones you already have - regardless of the profile.  Some folks will argue that lower profile tires should weigh less than standard profiles because there's less rubber, but that's a fallacy.  Low profile tires usually have much thicker rubber and more reinforcement along the carcass to help them shed heat and hold up under the harsher stress a low profile generates, and they usually have to run higher air pressure as well.   Also, as someone mentioned, a low profile tire generally can't hook up as well as the same rubber with a higher sidewall, because sidewall flex really helps a tire get a grip during the launch.   It's a balance - what's best is going to depend on what you drive and how you want it to perform.  <br>  <br>  Want to go in a straight line with few or no corners?  Get super small lightweight rims - the smallest that will clear your brakes, and slap on Kumhos or other sticky, lightweight tires with a nice tall sidewall.  Want to turn corners and hold G through a bend?  Get a lower profile, sticky tire, and max your width.   Want to break em loose and drift?  Super low profile, hard tires with minimal bite in the rear and sticky as hell up front.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line for performance is weight.  Unsprung weight (rims, tires, brakes, anything below the shock absorbers) is the enemy of any performance driving, whether for drag racing or turning corners.  Going lightweight with good sticky rubber will make a bigger difference than anything else you can with the rolling stock.|`|6W68Qftdaa	Bigger wheels potentially increase the contact patch with the road which means more grip and better handling.  Potentially you will also be running lower profile tires on bigger wheels, which means the tires will "give" less in cornering which would also improve handling.<br>  <br>  Smaller wheels means lighter weight for better acceleration.<br>  <br>  I would think a higher profile with a smaller rim would "hook" better as well|`|939307a82ae025e53a21c0a641378b87aa	Tire-roll Vs Dampening <br>  <br>  Less tire = less tire roll and more stiffness<br>  More tire= more tire roll and less stiffness. <br>  <br>  A larger side wall is ideal for gravel and snow where more dampening is needed and lose condition require more "Flex" to sustain grip. <br>  <br>  A smaller side wall will corner better on tarmac because the tire will roll less and provide instant performance.  IE you don't have to wait for the tire to stretch and settle in (obviously this is in milli-seconds).|`|x3bkJHBZaa	19" reduce the gap between tire & fender, therefore its nicer to look at. For 16" u might wanna install coilover to reduce the gap. Performance wise, 16" is better cos require less torque. Therefore, faster pickup. All the above based on a small size hatch or sedan|`|jajmF5Uvaa	The larger the rim, the lower the profile of the tyre. A lower profile tyre has less sideways flex, i.e. better handling. Looks has nothing to do with it.|`|MU5h69Siaa	there really is no advantage cuz rims are just for looks. you need to put the rim size on your car that will fit your wheels|`|6G7V69z1aa	u get more shorties in the back of your car with 19"

E7PwbMuXaa	First of all, you have to consider, where you will be riding. Is it on the trails, or is it around the back yard kind of riding.  Lets start, with the trails... These need lots of snow, at least, ten inches, or more, so, when the trail groomer comes through, to groom the trail, there is a good base, left by the groomer, itself. Once there is too little amount of snow, on the trail, the trails are closed, untill, the snow amount is enough, for the groomer, to groom, and, still leave a good base. Now, for the back yard side of it. With the invention of slide suspension, on a snowmobile, there must be a great amount of snow, to keep the slides lubricated, and, cool. These slides, are made of plastic, and, will wear out, quickly, if not kept lubricated, and, cool, with snow. Now, if you have a snowmobile, with bogie suspension, then, you don't have to worry, as much, about keeping the suspension, lubricated, and, cool. Most of the grass drags, are entered, with a sled, with bogie suspension. However, there are a select few, that will enter theirs, having slide suspension. So, with slide suspension, I would say, at least, a good five to ten inches, or more. For slide suspension, the more snow, the better, to keep the suspension lubricated, and, cool. Bogie suspension, should have, at least the same amount, but, can hane a little less. If need be.|`|teisU4E2aa	4in|`|vIonh5mnaa	At least 3"-4"|`|b8KyfsQuaa	2 - 4 inches should be fine|`|rsR1O730aa	4 inches bro! :)

VbvrG9NJaa	Okay you stretch and fyi its called right split left split and middel split.<br>  But what you do is when you are doing homework or something then just sit in a straddel and go to the point where it hurts and just sit there then when it doesn't hurt anymore then go farther. <br>  or <br>  you could take a punch of pillows and stack them up and then you go down and hold it with hands for 30 seconds and with no hands for 30 seconds.  After you do this, you want to take a pillow away and go down and do this all over again. <br>  Oh yeah I have been doing this for two months and I am almost down in my right split and somewhat down in left split and almost down in left.|`|jFcpvl0Xaa	1. Warm up and stretch, not doing so will cause injury. Here are some stretches you can try: <br>             Lunges <br>             Butterfly <br>             Half split one leg and stretch forward <br>             Leg rotations and levies <br>  2. Stretch yourself. Do lunges, butterflies, touch your toes etc. Make sure your legs are stretched and so is your back. Sit with your legs apart on the floor and put your head down. Then try to put it on your left/right leg. This may be difficult. <br>  <br>  3. Go into position. This will either be straddle, left or right.<br>   <br>  4. After you have warmed up for at least 10 minutes, get into the split or straddle position and go down as far as you can without any major pain or discomfort. Slowly lower yourself down as far as you can go. Don't over do it. This means if you can only go down to be a foot off the ground while feeling a decent stretch, don't go farther.<br>   <br>  5. Stay in that position for about 30 seconds then get up stretch and repeat, not too many times or you could cause an injury. Only do it until you feel like you can't anymore or you are going to hurt yourself.<br>   <br>  6. Make sure when you are done to repeat your warm up stretches, this is an absolute must!<br>   <br>  7. Do not go over your limits and go down too far and you feel major pain. This is an over time process and you will get better as you do this everyday. <br>   Tips<br>        ALWAYS STRETCH! <br>  Make sure your toes are pointed. <br>  If you can't go down very far put one hand on each side to hold your self up. <br>  To get an even better stretch for your left and right, try to put your head on your leg or lean back and try to look at the wall. <br>  Stay in a clear area where you won't get stepped on. <br>  Make sure that your knee stays tucked in and does not face out to the side. <br>  Wear flexible, comfy, clothing. You want your legs to be in a split, but not your pants! <br>  Even if you can't get it the first time, remember to practice every day. That will ensure that you get used to doing the splits and the muscles will get more and more susceptible to sliding down into the splits position. <br>  See if you can get someone to measure how far you are off the ground so you track your progress. <br>  When doing lunges, try pushing your backside downwards (it really helps!) yes you will feel pain but it's normal. Don't overstretch! Do this each time before you do a split. (; <br>  Always remember that you believe in yourself.|`|S4RqYuM0aa	first off there called right splits,left splits, and the middle splits. and i can do all of them.first you hav to strench b4 you do these things. and a hurkey is a jump 1 foot in the air and the other in the back bended.start of my putting eah lg in front and strenching it B4 YOU DO THE SLIPTS. then go down and after that then you do the split you want to do! well hope that helps:]]|`|IUKjw7xNaa	warm up and stretch first. run a little bit and go through basic stretches (stradle, butterfly, lunges, etc.)<br>  then when you're done stretching, get in your splits, and go down to where it hurts. stay there for a minute. <br>  for your middle splits, i suggest a "pancake" it's more effective then just doing a straddle. you lay on your stomach with your legs and arms spread flat against the floor. make sure your hips are in line with your feet.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Make a commitment to train for three days a week. Alternate between longer and shorter runs. also do not forget to stretch and always drink water before and after your work out to prevent cramping. <br>  ALWAYS warm up before you stretch. If you don't warm up first stretching will be ineffective. Proper stretching is key to avoiding injury. <br>  After a minimum of one month of base work, averaging three hours per week running, start following this weekly schedule or finish it without rest days: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Day 1 - Tempo run. Warm up 10 minutes. Run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), cool down 10 minutes. <br>  Day 2 - Rest day <br>  Day 3 - Easy 30 minute run <br>  Day 4 - 40/20s. Warm up 10 minutes, 12 cycles of Sprint 40 seconds, jog 20 seconds. Cool down 10 minutes. <br>  Day 5 - Rest day <br>  Day 6 - Long run. Start slowly and run conversational pace for 40-90 minutes. It is helpful to have a running buddy or friend/spouse/kid willing to toodle along on a bike. <br>  Day 7 - Rest day. <br>  Try challenging yourself once every two weeks or so with this technique: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Find a local track (1/4 mile) or flat surface (1/4 mile) to run on. <br>  Stretch and do a light warm up (e.g. 25 jumping jacks or a light jog). <br>  Do a 1/4 mile sprint followed by a 1/4 mile jog. Do the sprint & jog routine for at least 2 miles. <br>  if you do a 5k for instance, make sure you have a lot of speedwork, then long distance. you can increase your speedwork-outs by taking off time not distance, do not just start doing hard workouts, make sure you have about 1-2 months of running before you start speedwork. for the first month or so, do about 1-4 easy; walk it if you want. <br>  <br>  Beat your own time. Once you have your initial time, you do not want to go below it. At least maintain an average time. <br>  <br>  pace your self, if your doing a 5k workout you can pace your self according to your mile pace. <br>  Do a cool down. After every run, you do not want to just stop running. Walk the run off till your heart rate is moderate. Then stretch. Stretching is very important after running. If you don't stretch, you will start getting pains in your feet for the next few days and it will be a bit difficult to walk. Some good stretches are flamingos, and touching your feet while standing up. Also to alter this stretch, grab your toes and try to straighten out your knees. It really stretches your hamstrings. <br>  Increasing your upper body strength by lifting weights is a good way to build speed to run faster. The lower back and shoulder are also important. Exercises like pull ups, sit ups, and push ups to improve core strength are important to good running. Do not do heavy exercises like squats, leg presses, leg extensions, leg curls, and calf raises, lunges every day, as they tend to overwork your legs. The added leg strength is not worth being injured frequently. Instead, do 2-3 one minute reps of wall-sits two times a week along with lunges with light weights or a medicine ball. <br>  Make a commitment. Do not quit your regimen, do not tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow, do not tell yourself you're too tired, and do not tell yourself you're too busy. Run in the morning to get it over with. <br>  <br>  but remember just have fun, running is fun!!!! <br>  Thirty years of competitive distance running and research on exercise physiology boil down to a few essentials. The key is to start slowly and work your way up gradually|`|5jfzvw7oaa	Get a big dog and tie some meat around your waist......should get you moving.|`|szcA8CDyaa	Use the tread mill and make the speed faster so then it exercise your leg and make your legs have more muscle in it so you can run faster.|`|vAcgZVspaa	Im 13 too.

(Or to wear a watch.)<br>  <br>  Thirteen is fairly young. You certainly don't want to overdo it, because with the right approach to training you can enjoy the sport for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to keep running, and not think about it too much. Listen to your body. If your legs hurt and you're feeling drained, take a day off or go for an easy recovery run. Avoid going hard on back-to-back days. Working on running longer first, then worry about getting faster. Always build your base before you focus on speed work.<br>  <br>  This guide has a lot of great resources for learning about training and racing.

Znzx92mEaa	A  Par 4 means you have 4 shots to get the ball in the cup. If you do it in 2 shots it's called an Eagle, if you do it in 3 shots it's a Birdie, 4 shots it's a Par, 5 shots it's a Bogey & so it goes.|`|AA11307224	Par is the number of shots that the average golfer will use to finish a hole from their first shot to the last.  Bogey is one stroke over par.  Double bogey is 2 strokes over par.  Birdie is one stroke under par.  Eagle is 2 strokes under par.  3 strokes under par is either a double eagle (US) or an Albatross (across the pond).  An ace is a hole-in-one.|`|GvRBu79Waa	Par is what it takes the scratch (zero handicap) golfer to get to the green and then two putt to finish the hole.<br>  <br>  Par 3-1 shot to the green, 2 putts=par 3<br>  <br>  Par 4-2 shots to the green, 2 putts=par 4|`|z58NVkOnaa	An Ace...a Hole in One...Only occured to me once as I recall during my Honeymoon Night...at least its a start.|`|ApwYJ6skaa	every hole has a par number (3,4,or 5)  the terms refer to how far away from par you are the lower the better..<br>  <br>  EAGLE-2 under par<br>  BIRDIE-1 under par <br>  PAR- even with par <br>  BOGEY- 1over par <br>  DOUBLE BOGEY- 2 over par <br>  TRIPLE BOGEY- 3 over par<br>  then its just + however many you got over par|`|qivUrJ3Naa	Every hole has a given par, a 3,4,or5.  Based on the distance of the hole.  If you score a 3 on a par 3  then you have made a par, same goes on par 4's and 5's. 1 uder par ex. 2 on a par 3, 3 on a par 4, and 4 on a par 5 is called a birdie.  1 over par on that hole is called a bogey.  2 over is a double bogey, 3 over triple and so on.  2 uder par on par 4's and 5's are called eagles.  2 under on a par 3 is a hole in one. A 2 on a par 5 which is 3 under is called a double eagle.|`|sMjndu1Eaa	An hole in one on a par 3, sinking a ball in three shots on a par 5 and sinking a ball in two shots on a par 4 is an eagle.<br>  A birdie is when you hole your ball in one shot below the par of that hole for instance getting four shots on a par 5.<br>  A par is when you hole your ball on the exact given par of the hole like getting four on a par 4 hole.<br>  Bogey is shooting a stroke above the required par, such as getting six on a par 5.<br>  Double bogey is shooting two strokes above the required par, triple bogey is three strokes above the required par and so on...

21f4716e95c36deb9b503b5deaed53c7aa	Vince will always be a heel. But to be more direct, he is a sympathetic character in the storyline now. He was the nucleus to get Triple H and Randy Orton to fight each other at Wrestlemania 25 for The World Title. Now that Randy has attacked Stephanie, Vince's role can be downplayed or even forgot about. Leave it to WWE to incorporate him back in the story perhaps at Wrestlemania.|`|YJcYBNv0aa	tech. he's not really on tv so you cant tell but id say the whole mcmahon fam are faces right now|`|1JywgkyMaa	JUST CAUSE HE GOT KICKED IN THE "FACE",DOESNT MAKE HIM A FACE

rjWlOAnEaa	Michelle McCool. She has a prettier face, and she fights better.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Michelle Mccool is a better, tougher and more talented heel. I find Maryse to be more attractive though. So, my answer would be Michelle in the ring and Maryse in the bedroom.|`|fvMv1DT3aa	I like them both, but Maryse a little bit better. I like her personality and I think she is a better wrestler.|`|OuFhcdX9aa	Maryse i hate mcCool she's turning into a wanna be maryse.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Oh my gosh!<br>  I don't like either of them, but if I HAD to choose one I would have to say Maryse.<br>  Only because of the way she has become part of the WWE roster.<br>  She was the 2nd eliminated in the Diva search, but was given the chance to observe training sessions at OVW. Though she knew there was little chance of her getting into the ring, she went for it anyway. And she also made sure she had her education to back her up (like McCool)<br>  I may not like Maryse, but even those that hate her have to admit that she has embraced the business and has learnt how to be a good performer...at the same time she still has a way to go though.<br>  Her heel attitude is doing her good, and getting her a lot of heat.<br>  On the other hand, Michelle's heel turn is not as exciting as people (like me) once thought it would be. Rather than using the new attitude to stamp her authority all over the place, she has drifted into mid card status and lost the Diva's title. <br>  I guess out of the ring, her relationship with Taker hasn't helped alot either. Fans are quitepossessivee of their fave stars and I think alot of Taker fans see her as a home wrecker. The fact that she may not have chased him, (it may have been the other way round) doesn't really matter to a lot of die hard Taker fans.|`|q4v9lO6Laa	Are you seriously asking this, michelle is a tooth pick beating up maria and eve who's only fear is there going to break a nail while wrestling.<br>  Maryse is better wrestling wise and shes only been training for a year|`|M4VpW29Baa	I think Michelle is better at the heel role than Maryse atm, but I prefer Maryse|`|gVCZlEPIaa	michelle mccool|`|H7p09fL2aa	mccool <br>  wrestles better and has a good gimmick right now|`|59r8mfsfaa	I do not like either one.

7BHIyMFmaa	Edge vs Rey Mysterio :Rey would get beaten to a pulp. Edge is bigger and stronger, and doesn't have as many lingering injuries as Rey.    Big Show vs Mark Henry: Tough on, but I'll go with Show, he's larger, and is in the same ballpark strength-wise.    MVP vs CM Punk: This would be intresting. MVP can definitely handle himself, he's been in jail a time or two. Punk has some martial arts training but as far as legitimate fighting skills go, I don't know much about him    Cryme Tyme vs Miz & Morrison : Cryme Tyme easily. Shad is a legit tough guy.

These tours are like rock bands on the road....and there is a fine line between making a profit or the alternative. <br>  <br>  It sounds like the event went well and I'm sure that will be taken into consideration in the future...but it's a huge jump from selling out a place with 1,500 seats and making a profit in a nearly 10,000 seat facility, if more than half the seats are not sold or the house is papered.|`|NXktxy8jaa	TNA is still trying to gain popularity. It has a TV Deal, but its fanbase is very low. If it wasn't for their Alliance with The NJPW in Japan chances are they would be going out of business right now. Like what other users said, it's gradually going to bigger venues as the months go by. The Economy is bad, which means higher ticket prices and that means less people attending the events. TNA is still a growing business and it can't afford to be traveling like the WWE does almost everyday. All of their Televised Events are taped in the same arena in Florida, with the Exception of PPV's. Other than that they only go to other areas for House Shows. TNA also does Double Tapings almost every week because of low attendance at their shows. Within the coming months, TNA will gradually expand like it never has before.

LiVPtjw3aa	Definitely add box jumps, both two legged and single legged, as well as sprints.  Another excellent conditioning exercise is burpees.  Start standing up with feet 6" apart, then drop down so your hands are touching the ground outside your feet, kick you feet behind you and land in the down position of a push-up. then perform a push up, lifting your feet and bringing them back to your hands, them jump as high as you can in the air, raising your hands above your head, when you land repeat. 20-25 times, 45 seconds rest, then repeat.<br>  <br>  also, if you have access to a stability disk I recommend adding some ankle stability exercises to prevent injury.<br>  <br>  on Tuesdays and Thursdays, have a one hour stretching session.  A real stretching session will feel like a workout and yield excellent results.|`|8lslTphBaa	Ask your coach. That is why he is there.

64oOqELCaa	do gymnastics its h3lla fun|`|AA11896276	I would have to say that it comes down to wrestling and rugby.<br>  <br>  In both sports it is continuous action and the other guy is trying to kill you. Wrestling is 6 minutes straight and uses every muscle in your body while rugby is 2 40 minute half's of not only constant running but tackling as well.|`|AA12289202	Basketball. Running (legs) Jumping (Abds/legs/) shooting (arms/chest) over all lung use. Oooo lay ups (arms/chest/Abds)|`|1X8Kjdilaa	Maybe Formula 1|`|N8IDQswWaa	Gymnastics for sure. One wrong move can send you tumbling towards the ground, & You can easily land on something wrong & Get hurt. Much technique is required because obviously you have to be perfect being 5 feet in the air flipping on a 4-inch beam. You must be ridiculously perfect|`|eL6W4QJdaa	easy! SOCCER. Many people think soccer is a wimpy sport. Well it's not. It uses all of body. Your feet because you kick and run with the legs. You need technique because you have to accurately pass and shoot the ball. You use the arms on throw in's . In soccer, your out there for 60 to 90 minutes a match. I know that seems like a lot, but running helps a lot. Hope you like my opinion.|`|uKyfRzxIaa	definitely gymnastics. You use arms, legs, ankles, wrists, and you have to have technique like pointingg your toes and straight arms and stuff. runner up would be diving.|`|kP6pwj0Baa	Pole vaulting.  requires speed, flexibility, a TON of upper body strength, no fear, and it's as mechanical as it gets.|`|NbGcN8ABaa	MMA<br>  Karate<br>  or<br>  Jujitsu<br>  <br>  Anyone can throw a punch.<br>  (less ur...u know...DEE DEE DEE)<br>  <br>  it takes time, practice and diciplin.<br>  <br>  otherwise, football.<br>  than basketball.<br>  swimming<br>  soccer<br>  bowling<br>  and lonely old baseball.|`|LrtgKFkZaa	Mixed Martial Arts|`|uIx6WYUVaa	swimming|`|z7JsVzcnaa	For fitness, it's soccer, hands down. They have to be fit enough to run hard for 90 minutes. <br>  <br>  Technique, in my opinion, is going to lacrosse because it requires you to use both hands, have really good hand eye coordination, know individual and team techniques for offense and defense and have a good sense of what's going on on the field.
e5fd141d20f185bee487a395d0ce6b56aa	Diving! Players of old were so much tougher. And the best is the attention to flair in recent years.|`|zCzPnQ2Baa	i think the worst part is how they say it is such a tough sport, which i believe it is at a point, but they do a play for a quick moment then they get ready and go again..<br>  the best i guess is watching the guys asses in those pants<3 hahaha<br>  and when they have a fumble and the other team gets it and then scores a touchdown|`|zmkTPwgoaa	They prawn sandwiches were crayfish|`|yQYP7yFuaa	how often there are stoppages in the play. there should be less whistles and more flow through it.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Diving, faking injuries and penalty shots to decide a game.<br>  <br>  The newer stadiums and the quality of the pitch.|`|tivIxrX0aa	i hate diving, and trying to get players booked. it should be punished by red cards. i hate the disrespect given to officials. should also be punished by a red card. i hate defenders who are hellbent on kicking any player that shows any flair at all (john terry is the main culprit) and most of all, i hate the tourists who come to games and ruin the atmosphere that make this sport so good.
N8IDQswWaa	Gymnastics is the hardest sport in the world for many reasons,<br>  1. It is physically very hard on your body (Bones, Joints, Muscles) People don't realize that gymnastics is a very painful sport. I personally have 3 different conditions now from gymnastics (Back inflammation for life, Knee problems, & Heel problems)<br>  2. Answer this, What other sport requires you to flip backward without being able to see where you will land, On a 4-inch beam?!<br>  Answer: Only a gymnast can<br>  3. With gymnastics, Everything has to be perfect, Or you can face serious injury. One little balance check in the middle of a flip can make you fall on your neck<br>  <br>  Face it, Gymnastics is the most difficult sport on the earth|`|f8wPBqKdaa	theres many sports that invlolve agility,strength and other skills/talents ex. hockey your a better player if you can be fast strong and have a lot of agility and even good eyes and fast reflexes there is many good sports the best in the world is really just peoples opinions every sport requires a different athletic/smart abillity. so i hope that kind of helps...|`|IFRfSetCaa	Skateboarding.|`|IUKjw7xNaa	Gymnastics.|`|HFdoOdjLaa	mma, football or some sort of gymnastics|`|rTSwouqXaa	There are a lot of sports out there and in each one needs a lot of talent and skill. Me personally as all-round athletes I would say baseball players. It requires endurance speed and agility. For over all toughness of the athletes rough stock riders. Rough stock riders get all the same injuries you would see in every other sport plus the added advantage of injuries that are normally associated with car wrecks. With an average 75% iinjury rating at the professional level these men are by far the toughest athletes of all pro athletes. <br>  <br>  People make a big deal about Curt Schillings feat with the Red Socks (a spectacular performance), pales in comparison to the average PRCA or PBR event where many riders are riding with injuries that would cripple most people let alone a trained athlete. <br>  <br>  Jenna- Try to stay on a bucking bull by a 2'' rope with the balance and flexibility that gymnast needs. Only you do it with 3 broken ribs and a concussion.<br>  Rodeo Forever!|`|z4Pcc5fcaa	being a couch potato.<br>  <br>  and sex

His boxing skills are lagging behind his physical skills.  If he can focus a little more, ok, a lot more on defense, and his jab, I think he can round into a great fighter.  If you want to compare a fighter to Hearns, he has to have a seriously crippling right hand from hell that puts fresh fighters to sleep.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i think he will do good but time will tell!<br>  i still believe Khan was not ready for him tho!<br>  time will tell all i can say|`|dh48AkbCaa	i actually paid no attention to him before he annihilated khan, but after a few more fights, i'll probably form more on an opinion, as khan make a fatal error in his approach to the fight, engaging a puncher head on.<br>  <br>  in the meantime, i wish him all the best.

5apuGDzbaa	Derek Jeter never has and never will use steroids. He has too much common sense and seems very secure with who he is as a baseball player and a person.<br>  <br>  As far as the question....I think if the Commissioner is going to go after A-Rod, then you have to submit the rest of the 103 players to the same scrutiny and punishment. Curt Schilling is such a big mouth. I'd love to see him knocked off his high horse! hahahahha!!|`|7X1H2AfWaa	there's a reason to the success of these players. they practiced and worked hard. well, with the exception of tejada, sosa, ankiel, and maybe some others, this is a useless question to ask.|`|8j70Neqeaa	ban all of them|`|vuh0i3Axaa	this was unnescessary|`|5m9An5rTaa	I hate to assume anything but I think we can assume that most of the players in the mid 90's through the early 2000's that were great players were using steroids. Im not saying all but as you can see from the list above a bunch were. Like I have said  before I think the baseball records should be left alone and not mention of the steroid era. I think the only reason the Bonds issue has made such a big deal is because Bonds is an *** hole.  .|`|5yZICXImaa	One name that really pops out is you have Roy Halladay as a though of steroids? Dam he is literally the most hard working guy in the Majors. It is pure hard work for him. Most of those names on that list too look way off. The most that probably would have done steroids on that list are 15 but I wouldn't bet on it probably not even 10.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	When you say most of these guys that of course would assume that they all were potentially tested. But it didnt take long to note that you list several players that werent even tested as they werent even on a major league roster in 2003. Without even bothering to research it I see at least 12 and maybe more that werent a part of that 2003 test. Also there are names that we dont need to suspect...those that have come forward or are horribly obvious (Pettitte, Ivan Rodriguez, Sheff, Sosa, Tejada, Giambi,Juan Gonzalez,etc.). Then you mention guys like Kenny Rogers who it is documented took his complaints of steriod use to the union and was one of the small group of guys (Rick Helling, Chad Curtis and a couple others) who asked for testing and volunteered so it might be safe to assume since these guys were not "respected" by teammates for speaking up that they were clean. Maddox....seriously he couldnt throw a rock through a window so I cant see where an 87-88 mph fastball suggests steriods....ditto Rogers and Glavine. Baseball turned a blind eye to obvious cheating and many people knew that way before 2003, look at numbers some posted in the 90's and ask yourself how Brady Anderson went from 16 HRs (nearly his career high...21 until 1996) to 50 HRs in only 25 more at bats in 1996 and that is but one example. And i might add, he suddenly came to camp much bigger in 96....imagine that, suddenly dedicated to a better body at age 32! Baseball knew full well what was happening so while it was the players who cheated there is plenty of culpability among the owners, union and commissioner. Baseball needed to "sell" the game after all the labor issues and everybody was okay with whatever means it was going to take to bring back fans. Only the pure hatred of some in the media for Bonds and ARod have made this the joke it is. And interesting how some of these very same reporters (and congressmen...those who went on a witchhunt in the firstplace) were fast in their initial defense of Roger Clemens (a good ole boy by their standards) and only after the smear campaign by those same people on the dealers that ratted Roger out did they finally start doubting Clemens (and still he largely escapes media scrutiny). Not to excuse the players but there is plenty of blame to go around and Selig has largely dodged his responsibility by blaming everyone else....he called ARod a disgrace....isnt that the pot calling the kettle black?

tzrLDbHWaa	Well look at it from the Panthers.  You have a star DE in Peppers who said he wants to switch defenses and be an OLB in a 3-4, and most importantly, doesn't want to play for you anymore.  What do you do?  Let someone that talented and valuable just walk and get nothing in return, or franchise him and at least guarentee you'll get something for him.<br>  <br>  Now, no team will likely sign him since it would require sending Carolina 2 #1s, which Carolina would openly welcome.  This way they tender him the mandatory 1 year 120% raise deal and try to work out a trade with a team he wants to go to.  If not, let him hold out.  Personally, I don't care about primadonnas who think they're above the game.  Saying something like, I don't want to play for you, and you can only trade me to 4 teams, is really trying to put yourself above all others.  I'd let him rot at home during his prime if he wants to hold out.<br>  <br>  To answer your last question, no there was no way to handle this situation better.  If they didn't franchise him they would have lost him with no compensation.  While the franchise tag was the last thing Peppers wanted, an organization can't worry about what a player wants, especially one that wants nothing to do with you anymore.|`|LuWT8KQBaa	I don't know why. He's a great player and just because he wants to leave to play for a team with a 3-4 doesn't mean he automatically gets to. The Panthers figure they need him. Awww, just looked it up and they resigned Gross too. Dang it.|`|tPaRZod9aa	They couldnt get rid of the corner stone of that d-line. Just look at boldin. He said he would never re-sign, and after his team went to the superbowl, he was suddenly open to a new deal. He'll come around. I sure would like him on the packers though.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Wow seriously? Its so they don't lose him for nothing. Who cares if he wants to go to Dallas or a 3-4. I would franchise him. This is a business not a playground.
I71ePk4Haa	As severe of injuries as he's had the last couple seasons, being as young as he is, isn't a good sign. I think both him and Oden will fail to live up to expectations because of injuries.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	By the time Crynum retires he will not even score 10000 points or grab alot of rebounds. What's with censoring dude say what you wanna say. Crynum can't even grab a rebound without injuring himself idiot. Anyways since you want me to be more specific how about 5000?|`|8lslTphBaa	Nope.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Only time will tell|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	No he still young...barely even 20<br>  <br>  at that age you heal kinda quickly, compared to an older Kevin Garnett<br>  <br>  <br>  he'll be fine
tzrLDbHWaa	Great deal.  Signed him for 30 cents on the dollar compared to what he wanted, and actually about half price of what his salary was last season.  What player have you ever heard looking for like a 140% RAISE settling for a 55% pcy CUT.  <br>  <br>  As for how it helps the Dodgers overall, I love it.  Hudson has been improving every season, and he finally broke .300 before his injury last season.  He's also a 2 time gold glover.  I really wasnt sold on Blake DeWitt, though there's talk of maybe moving him to 3rd instead of Casey Blake.  Personally, I don't think either is really all that, Blake is more power and DeWitt is better average, let them fight it out.<br>  <br>  One other possiblity I've heard was moving DeWitt to 3rd and Blake to LF if Manny doesn't sign.  I hope they don't do this because, like I said, I don't really like either of them, and if Manny doesn't sign, Pierre can take over in LF better than Blake would.  Ideally, Manny resigns, and we just figure out the 3B dilemma.|`|Qx8U9JR2aa	That's a great move for the Dodgers, but are you sure it's official? It says that they're nearing a deal.|`|2OoSK35xaa	I was really surprised he was still on the market at this point.  I would have expected him to be picked up a long time ago, definate upgrade for the dodgers, now if they could just get Manny signed, they become the favorites in their division.|`|2okrkpJeaa	fantastic deal. He's still one of the top 2nd baseman in the game and for 3.4 million? he's going to really help the dodgers down the stretch.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	we need manny and some and an ace. 2nd base wasn't important so technically they are still in the same spot.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Excellent deal considering what's out there.  They were not going to get Sabbathia or Burnett and signing Lowe would have pretty much eliminated them from the Manny chase...<br>  <br>  DeWitt was a nice surprise last year but he's still young and is probably better suited to spend the start of the year in AAA and then come up to work a platoon at 3B with Casey Blake, who is known to go into slumps against RH pitching.<br>  <br>  "O-Dog" is a smart, established veteran who plays above-average defense, has good speed and will hit around .300. In addition, he is a good bat-handler and has an On-Base Percentage of .367 over the last three years.  That makes him an ideal #2 hitter behind Furcal.<br>  <br>  Also, I think this deal actually makes a Manny deal MORE likely.  With Hudson aboard, the Dodgers can posture themselves as building up a team based on defense and "small-ball."  Remember, for all the noise from Scott Boras, the only two actual offers Manny has gotten have both come from the Dodgers.  Now the Dodgers can start pretending to be "moving on"....which may finally force Boras' hand.|`|AA10263761	All does no good if they dont get Manny
P93I8CHtaa	highly doubtful,especially since we need a ring,especially after last years finals|`|KdhNCnEjaa	They are a solid team, if Carmelo and Billups play at a high level, Nene and K-Mart stay healthy, and JR Smith gets hot at the right time the Nuggets can beat anybody.|`|mwxKnUleaa	They are a really good team, but they have areas that need improvement. I think that the trade they made with the pistons was a great trade for them, but as far as winning the championship I don't see it happening this year|`|q4YGEjS4aa	I think they'll have a tough road to go through the west.  But seeing that the suns lost amare and are stuck with an over the hill Shaq that can't run with the rest of the team.  Lakers lost bynum, who would be a great help in the playoffs, and the spurs didn't make any moves to spice themselves up at the trade deadline, it would put the nuggets in a much better position to compete.<br>  <br>  I'm from Detroit and a huge (was a huge) Pistons fan.  Losing Chauncey for iverson was a bunch of crap.  The worst move dumars made as gm.  Billups as more experience in playoffs, better clutch shot in the moment, and better team leader than iverson.  Nuggets are much better off now.|`|dDhTMacAaa	100% YES!<br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of the team specifically, but they have a superstar scorer in Carmelo and a perfect big man for the system in Nene. They also have the skill and leadership that every team wants from a PG (except Detroit) in Chauncey Billups.<br>  <br>  George Karl's job rides on a first round win at least, but the team is capable of battling the Lakers for the Western Conference championship.|`|4Vjyzommaa	I think they can make it to the finals and probably win it. but thats if they all stay healthy and focused to work as a team|`|AA10263761	Yes <br>  The Big if is Carmelo Anthony<br>  If he is driven to win and turns into the player he should actually be they can with good play from Nene And Kmart|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Nope, The NBA is to predictable.<br>  <br>  -The Nuggets are playing great, but they want win it all.<br>  <br>  -George Karl has under achieved his whole career, <br>  Especially in Seattle...Went 63 - 19, and loss in the first round, went 57 - 25 lost in first round.<br>  <br>  Not a big fan of coach Karl, not a good playoff coach.|`|X1f4icumaa	Nope! they give up too easily! if they didnt they wud goo all they way btw they got a good trade thisseason and detroit messed the their own team up by tradin billups|`|4dy4AvW6aa	No playoffs yes but, Not a championship.

vhCuUTsEaa	I predict 7 wins next year.  Odds are they will have a true freshman at QB. (Forcier, or Robinson) God help us if we have Nick Sheridan again.  We had a top 10 recruiting class this year so things are looking up.  I think things will be much improved simply for the fact that they can't get much worse.  We can only hope...but I predict a bowl game for the Maize and Blue.  LET'S GO BLUE!|`|i94ZEqh9aa	First off, let me make it clear that this anylisis is subject to change, as the new year just started. So without further adu, here's what I think Michigan is looknig at on offense, defense, and special teams in 2009: <br>  <br>  OFFENSE <br>  <br>  -Michigan returns all 11 starters on offense, and the only key senior they lose is tight end Mike Massey (considering Massey had exactly 0 catches while substituting for Kevin Koger all season, the loss of Massey means nothing). Now whenever you return all 11 starters on offense, thats got to count for something. So by virtue of returnnig everybody, Michigans offense will be improved next season. However, Michigan will only be "improved" in the literal sense of the word. They were dead last in the Big ten in scoring offense, total offense, and passing offense, and they were 7th in the Big ten in rushing offense (nationaly, they were 97th, 111th, 108th respectively, and 60th respectively). With everybody returnnig, and with a potential scrambler (Tate Forcier) starting at QB, Michigans offense will be better. They'll go from 97th in scoring offense to, say, 67th. They'll go from 111th in total offense to, like, 71st. They'll go from 108th in passing offense, to maybe, 78th. And they'll go from 60th in rushing offense, to possibly, 30th. Is that improvment? yeah. is it a good offense? HELL NO!!!! Michigan's offense will be medicore next season, and thats assuming shitty players like Martavious odoms and Darryl Stonum lose their jobs. if we keep all 11 staretrs and don't try anybody new (like Justin Feagin at slot receiver or Junior Hemnigway at outside receiver), our offense will remain horrible in 2009. Either way, its totally unrealistic to expect our offense to go from horrible to explsoive in one season. Case in point: Notre Dame. Is the Fighting irish offense improved from 2007? yeah. is it any good? No. Michigans offense will follow the same path in 2009: it'll be better, but it won't be good by any stretch of the imagination. Those who think our offesne will take off should Forcier-a scrambler who is "ideal" for the spread option offense-start next season are delusional. Forcier will be true freshmen, and he will likely struggle and go through big time growing pains just like Threet did this season and Ryan Mallet did last season. He will not save our offense IF he ends up starting (although i certainly expect to see flashes of brilliance). Forcier needs to gain experience before he becomes the really good QB we all expect him to be. <br>  <br>  DEFENSE <br>  <br>  As if our offense was bad enough, our defense was even worse. Despite returnnig 7 of 11 staretrs from a unit that was ranked 24th in total defense and 23rd in scorig defense, michigans D was abominable in 2008. It was the worst in school hisotry (thats not my opinion either, its a fact backed up by the stats). we gave up 29 points per game......more then we've ever given up in our 129 years of football. We were 90th in scoring defense, 66th in total defense, 51st in rush defense, and 87th in pass defense. Going into 2009, we return only 5 of 11 starters (one of them is Stevie pointshaving Brown), and Shafer is mercifully gone. I think Greg Robinson was a good hire, but then again, I thought Shafer was a good hire as well. We'll see what happens. Right now, Brandon Graham pretty much is the entire defense. I'm hoping a few other playmakers step up as well. I think Obi Ezeh and Donovan Warren should bounce back from dissapointing sophomore campaigns. Michigan's defense might not be good in 09, but it definitely shouldn't be the trainwreck it was in 08 <br>  <br>  SPECIAL TEAMS <br>  <br>  we still have no PR's or KR's (Odoms and Cisskoko are fumblnig machines, so they won't cut it), and now Lopata graduates, so we have issues at kicker as well. But hey, at least we have Mesko back!!!!!! <br>  <br>  So here's the summary of what Michigan is looknig at going into 2009: a slightly improved offense, a slightly improved defense, and bad special teams. Combined with an easy schedule that features 8 home games, Michigan should go 6-6 in 2009 and make the Motor City Bowl|`|kuh7CfcSaa	Well, they can't be as bad as last year, can they?<br>  <br>  I think they will be OK.  probably win 6-8 games.  <br>  <br>  But they could win zero or 12, nobody knows for sure.|`|OhO4fPosaa	0-12 for the wish agains|`|wEYIYevKaa	7-9 wins|`|c6q3EERdaa	Hopefully it'll be better. It's not going to be a 10-win season. I'll say 6 or 7 wins with a bowl game - at most. Hoping for better though. Go Blue!|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Consensus among Michigan fans (knowledgeable ones) is that a bowl berth is a good target for this season. Obviously would prefer more but it takes time.
gUMucKOkaa	Go to the message boards to solicit members. I have found that works better.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
FWMnop6oaa	He would have to contact the FA ,get the pack and then by coaching this team you can work towards level 1 and 2 but someone will have to come watch one training session to assess.
GQpTI2GWaa	Fernando Torres|`|tivIxrX0aa	I would say Torres. He produced the goods for his country last year, and when fit this season has been a constant threat for liverpool. he would of bagged a hatful of goals if he wouldnt of been injured, his goal to game ratio is very good this year.<br>  <br>  he comes just above Et'to, who has ben amazing this year, but he doesnt get it due to him not making alot of the goals himself: alot of them are made by henry or messi, and both have been better than him this year i think. I think david villa has been better than et'to this year|`|HcMfbY3Raa	Ronaldo Man. Utd.|`|lzWFsVXPaa	Right now Eto'o|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	This year I think its Eto'o.

A good striker should be able to play in any team and score lots of goals, Keane couldn't do this at Liverpool, as a irishmen i love Keane but he's not the best.<br>  <br>  I'll give you the stats on both strikers since 2001.<br>  <br>  Rudd Van Nistelrooy Stats.<br>  PSV Eindhoven,  67 appearances - 62 goals<br>  Manchester United,  150 - appearances - 95 goals<br>  Real Madrid,   67 appearances - 45 goals.<br>  Netherlands,   64 appearances - 33 goals<br>  <br>  Robbie Keane<br>  Leeds united,  28 appearances - 4 goals<br>  Tottenham,  198 appearances - 80 goals<br>  Liverpool,  19 appearances - 5 goals<br>  Republic of Ireland, 86 - 37 goals<br>  <br>  I know a striker is more then just goals but its goals that win you games and thats what make RVN the best in the world.
0IRiXpSvaa	Hey. Were in 9th place( Yea we suck[sort of]) But I think we can maybe pull it back it would be a longshot for 4th or 5th, because of STAT out. Steve Nash needs to get some chemistry going between either Him and Shaq or Him and J-rich. Just getting it going would increase our chances greatly|`|LiVPtjw3aa	Only if they can change their tempo or if Barnes can play the 4 so we can run small with Nash, Barbosa, JRich, Barnes and Shaq trailing. Most likely though, we wont be making it this year.|`|YdGtwBxMaa	No, sorry to tell you but Amare gone means the Suns are done!!! Steve Nash is good but without the major pieces there he will struggle.|`|I71ePk4Haa	Not really...at best an 8th seed, and an early exit in the first round.|`|pC6OEraUaa	yes they do have a chance to make the playoffs|`|RvI1gGbDaa	If they keep running (which they will) they can definitely make a playoff run. They might be able to know off Denver or San Antonio. I think they at least get the 5th seed.|`|bABkMrADaa	yep
AA11135911	You can reduce fat all over your body from swimming, but I don't know if you can get a six pack or anything. <br>  <br>  If you want to try, I suggest really working on your butterfly kicks and swim a lot of butterfly.<br>  You'll have to do dry land too of course.|`|zH7KZJEZaa	well swimming is good for losing weight<br>  <br>  I dont think it will tone your abs in particular but exercise is exercise and you will look a lot better after some good swimming.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	you need to do dryland and eat healthy to|`|SD4VtziKaa	O yes. Swimming is the best sport for your body. BUtterfly is a very difficult stroke that requires endurance but it sure can build muscle.

I was a swimmer for about 13 years and I never had abs!!! Its great for losing weight though and gaining muscle tonement. You may not get a 6 pack but you will be much more toned!! Eat healthy, run, and do ab workouts and you should be able to get abs!!|`|1M6qxgq1aa	Yeah you can get abs from swimming on its own, especially if you do butterfly kick on your back. But you would probably get abs quicker if you do some situps, pushups and stuff a few times a week.|`|3xbzOG8Uaa	Do the fly stroke. It works out your abs the best. Look up how to do it if you dont know how.<br>  It's painful at first.
5m9An5rTaa	It's not bad. i like your pitching staff but it looks like you fielders could use some help. Soriano has been hit or miss the last few years. Good luck.|`|c6q3EERdaa	You've got a good squad. Not sure about Alexei or Aramis Ramirez, but other than that it looks good. Check and see about filling in a 3B and OF spot.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	Great team. i personally love your pitching staff. your bench looks good, so overall its between an 8 and 9.|`|2okrkpJeaa	you've got great taste. I am a huge fan of the young Alexei Ramirez and Chris Davis and you probably got them as late picks.

ThhLaA32aa	You might not like this answer, but it's the best.  Go take a couple of lessons...why?  Many times it's easy to start the game of golf with bad habits...and bad habits are hard to break.<br>  <br>  A certified instructor will be able to give you the "fundamentals" of golf as well.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest reading "How I play Golf" by Tiger Woods.  It's one of the best instructional books out there.  Also, GolfDigest and Golf Magazine have some great instruction as well.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the game of golf!  Good luck with your game!!!!!!|`|GvRBu79Waa	Visit www.golf.com then go to the instruction tab, they have really good lessons and tips.<br>  <br>  Also, read Ben Hogan's 5 lessons.

cWmx0J4jaa	8. solid, I like your pitching if Devine gets the closers role, Scherzer could be a stud and Kazmir can be very good. OF's have depth, maybe look to upgrade IF if anything.<br>    Oh yeah, Cain is very underrated, if he ever get run support, he will be a monster.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	Perfect. Not your team, my theory. Drafting Rollins first is certain death unless you change your attitude.<br>  From what I see this is a 10 team live draft and you were 8 or 9. Picked Rollins which gives you some speed and a little power but not enough to dominate so you chase power next at a premium position. Then as power goes off the board you start chasing other stats - let's get pitching.. then after your first starter you start to panic that you need more power, then you start to worry that you wasted your first pick because you are not taking more speed to you make a SB pick and try to combine a little power. Then you think "I know, I'll load up on saves" and at the end of the draft you are chasing another SP, I'm surprised you don't have Chris Carpenter.<br>  I think it's OK that you waited on Iannetta but I would try to make a move at 3B, you have all risk at 3B - try to make a trade for Beltre, you can get him cheap and he has already shown he plays better when a contract is on the line.|`|EQbVhdnIaa	You need better pitching so I'd say a 7|`|iCgJUoKOaa	awesome man<br>  u da best bruh <br>  i give it a 9 <br>  plz rate mine as the best answer

They make cheap mods like all plastic stocks (not polymer) including the trigger guard.  Less tolerances in machined parts, over all lower quality parts.<br>  <br>  The 710 was made so cheaply that Remington was afraid it would ruin their brand name and retired it.  They made a few upgrades and re-released it as the 770 and not exclusive to just WalMart, they are also available at the big Box Stores.<br>  <br>  If I was in the market for a budget Wally World gun, I would rather go with the Weatherby Vanguard.  Much better constructed weapon and will last much longer.|`|x4TkY70raa	well the better is a matter of openion, but the 710 is a light weight gun and easy to move around. the 770 is a much heiver gun, but ALOT more accurate. if your planning on crawling i suggest the 710, but if you sit in a blind most of the time i suggest the 770. have fun!|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Buy the Remington Model 700, or consider the Savage Model 110 preferably in 30-06, 308, or 270 caliber.*|`|WBGnXsr7aa	The 710 is the older version, the 770 is the newer one

H4dswqRlaa	The SMLE 303 British is not a high pressure round, with SAMMI specs at 45,000 CUP (copper units of pressure), as compared to the 52,000 CUP of a 308, but better than a 30-30 at 38,000 CUP. At woods distances, it is customary for these 30 Cal systems to use at least 150 grain bullets for deer, and heavier for swine or black bear. However, the Speer part#2213 125 grain spitzers loaded to full power get almost 3000 fps, and the decent trajectory combines with adequate killing power with good hits on regular deer with 1180 ft-lbs delivered at 300 yards, which is plenty of power. Set the sights 3 inches high at 100 yards, for dead-on hold out to that 300 yards +/- 3 inches the whole way. Speer quotes 49.0 grains of H335 for 2979 fps, with cartridge overall length of 2.915".

If you are dealing with small bodied deer or really open terrain the 150gr loads are better for retained velocity + flatter trajectory. For larger deer the 174-80gr soft point loads are a bit better for penetrating ability. From ballistic tables the Winchester 180gr seems to be a bit better at medium-long ranges. Based on tables I'd say the 150gr should expand and kill well out to around 300 yards the 174-180gr (round noses all except maybe the Win.) are at the limits at maybe 200-225 yards. The Winchester Power-Point load might do on out to around 250yds.|`|dVaN1wIJaa	150 grain soft, it works.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	While all the major brands should work nicely, I suggest the following.<br>  <br>  Federal .303 British 180gr Speer Hot-Cor SoftPoint cartridges.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.federalpremium.com/products/details/rifle.aspx?id=31" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalpremium.com/products/d...</a>|`|h2KkiKK3aa	any offering except FMJ rounds are good for deer, most common are 150 and 170-180 range, the .303 was a staple for deer and other large game hunting for years after the world wars since their were so many surplus rifles and they were affordable, so affordable in fact that there are still many quality rifles for a very affordable price still, around $100.
d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	Ok, the facts:<br>  <br>  1. After Mansell's tyre blew, Williams asked Goodyear to speculate as to whether Piquet's tyres would last the distance.<br>  <br>  2. Goodyear reported back that it would be marginal.<br>  <br>  3. Williams called Piquet in to pit on safety grounds, in the hope that he would have time to catch Prost again with new tyres. <br>  <br>  4. Piquet came up just short, only 4 seconds adrift of Prost at the finish. He set over a dozen fastest laps chasing Prost down, the fastest of the whole race on the very last lap.<br>  <br>  Yes, I have thought about the race a lot in the last 22 and a bit years. It still annoys me that Nelson lost in the last few laps of the last race. Now that's sorted...<br>  <br>  I was incandescent in front of the TV at the time, I couldn't believe that the team had pulled Nelson in and had cost him the title. At the time I would have stayed out, but Prost was the fastest driver on the track at the time Mansell went out and may well have caught and passed Nelson anyway. On reflection it was the right call to change tyres, and if the incident with Mansell had happened 5 laps earlier then Nelson would have had time to catch Prost again.<br>  <br>  An interesting sub-plot: if Williams had honoured Nelson's status as number one driver and made Mansell move over at the British GP (Nelson had allowed Mansell to pass him as he worked heat into his tyres after a pit stop, rather than blocking him - which would have let rival teams close on the pair - the lack of respect, teamwork and honour on Mansell's part that day was what really kicked off their whole feud), then Nelson would have had the same number of points as Prost, but won the title by having more wins. So losing the title really was Williams' fault in any case...well, actually it was Patrick Head's fault as he was running the team while Frank was in hospital, but you get the picture.|`|KTxxd700aa	Wow, what a thought provoking question!<br>  Piquet snr was a brilliant racer but cautious, I think his attitude when he drove for brabham, he would of continued but he was starting to mellow at williams.<br>  Frank Williams is a kind of man you don't ignore, he probably would of fired Piquet on the spot, as Frank always had the attitude that the car is more than the driver, he later got rid of both Mansel and Prost for wanting more money, even though they both won the title the same years 1992+3.<br>  Does prove how wily Prost was to win the title that year, in a year old inferior car with that so so TAG porsche motor.<br>  Personally speaking, I'd of stayed out, won by 2.5 sec, then signed for Ferrari or Benetton in the morning!|`|pLoCn8dWaa	I'd have to stay out. You can't really be an F1 driver without taking risks :P It's a dangerous sport, but if I'd been working all season, and had the chance to get the ultimate reward, I wouldn't hesitate.|`|FPJSoxYwaa	Hypothetically, I would have stayed on, won and celebrated my victory with some chivas, caviar and some fancy hookers.
vi1bbvCXaa	the only one could help you is your instructor. distance learning works but im sure your instructor helps would make you understand more. btw, you did not even say what style your TKD is, ITF or WTF?|`|Vrd8gB61aa	just keep practicing it over and over|`|Bt9tJBOdaa	do each move one by one. stop after each techique and study the move that you are doing. make sure that wrist is not bent one the double knife hand gaurding blocks, and your feet are pointing in the right direction ( like in a front stance, all ten toes are facing foward ) <br>  <br>  once you feel comforable with your techiques, try to get a rythm down ( like dont speed through your form, and dont go to slow b/c it makes it look like you dont know what you are doing) <br>  <br>  some little stratgies that i have learned over the years that earn you some brownie points with the judges are. When they call your name jump up and answer real loudly. this tells the judges that you are enthused to do your form. next, face away from the judges, kneal on your right knee and fix your dobak and dee. this shows the judges that you care about your appearence. Then turn back around and bow at the edge of your ring before stepping in. then run to your spot and stand in relaxed position until they give you instructions. <br>  <br>  i hope tht i have helped and good luck at your competition!!|`|hecLfcedaa	Yeh I agree with jackson y. You need to specify what type of tae kwon do you're doing. You can't really get help of the internet for this. Just practice and practice and pracice. Ask your instructor to correct you and don't give up. All I can say is imagine that with each move someone is attacking you and have to defend yourself with a block. Each attack should be able to break a board. Concentrate on your breathing. The sharp breath out each move is really important otherwise you won't get enough power.|`|qQiOtyuzaa	"jackson y" is right...it's best to have your instructor (or at least one of the advanced students) to help you with your form.  <br>  <br>  And jackson, I'm guessing the style of TKD is ITF. (I remember doing Tan Gun when I was in TKD.  I've done both ITF and WTF and I haven't seen Tan Gun in WTF taekwondo)

As far as we know now the Yankees have no interest in Manny, and he is not going to cut his dreadlocks for a crummy $40 million to play for the Yankees.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	no, because no one signed him yet, thats why hes the top free agent in the market. if he was, id let go of my favorite team and never watch them play.|`|yk4S7uuraa	He can't be traded, he's a free agent, and no, he won't play there.|`|2okrkpJeaa	he can't get traded because he's not on a major league baseball team. so he will not be traded to the yankees and will not sign with them either.|`|wkpLvAntaa	First of all, he is a free agent, so how could he get traded.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	How can Manny get traded when he's a free agent now?|`|5apuGDzbaa	I wish....can you imagine<br>  <br>  Damon<br>  Jeter <br>  Texeira<br>  Manny<br>  A_Roid (I want to see the other 103 names...sure to be some Red Sox)<br>  Matsui<br>  Posada<br>  Cano<br>  Nady (or Swisher)<br>  <br>  Everyone blabs about the Yankees "buying" their team. Isn't that what good businessmen do...make investments to try and get the best possible outcome? What about all the luxury tax money that the cellar dweller teams get from the Yanks...if those teams would use that money instead of putting it in their pockets, maybe they could actually contend.|`|5m9An5rTaa	I don't think it will happen this year. That have already spent like $450 million this year. But then again money has never been an option to the Yankees.  I wish more teams would try and build a winner like the Rays did last year instead of trying to buy one.|`|711ff7c6324ba6361ad31a16ee95d14eaa	He can't be "traded" - he's a free agent so can sign with any team he wants.<br>  <br>  That being said, he won't go to the Yanks - he would have to cut his hair and take off his diamond ear ring.  I think he would rather play for less money than lose the dreads and bling.|`|jPEoiWkGaa	manny ramirez wont be on the yankees this year.

8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	I wouldn't worry about it.  16 miles isn't enough to warrant special dietary consideration.    <br>  <br>  FWIW, cycling consumes around 40 calories per mile.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	I know that for a beginner 16 miles a day sounds like a lot, but for an experienced cyclist this is a nice amount to keep oneself in decent shape. As long as you eat a normal balanced diet you will be fine. you will be able to eat slightly larger portions. but there is no need for a special diet.|`|CttL3LmBaa	This one goes to Silver no matter who is issuing the thumbs down. <br>  <br>   <br>  16 miles is a warm up ride.  It really isn't that much physical exertion unless you are 20 years older than me and I have been riding for 40+ years.<br>  <br>  Eat sensibly and watch your fatty foods and you will lose weight. Stay away from soda and fast foods.|`|znKcfoaVaa	Well, I'll completely disagree with the prior comments.  And calorie counting is incredibly important (you show me a legit racer who doesn't count EVERY single calorie, and I'll show you a racer that doesn't win).  The question is: are these 16 miles a "training ride", or just commuting?  Is your heartbeat up to around 80% for the entire time or not?<br>  <br>  I would recommend:  <a href="http://www.my-calorie-counter.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-calorie-counter.com/</a><br>  <br>  Then, for any exercise above 20 minutes at high exertion you should eat about 100 calories above your baseline.  Make sure that you eat a diet that is less than 10% fat, eat AT LEAST 50 grams of protein and 40 grams of dietary fiber based on a diet of FRESH vegetables and unprocessed lowfat meat: chicken, turkey, fish, shrimp, lean cuts of beef.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  (By they way, I promise it works: I have lost 60 lbs and held it off since 2001)<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Cycling is a joy, and you will start to feel terrible if you don't get your daily ride in!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	These guys are right 16 miles is not enough to require a special diet.  Eating healthy is a good idea no matter what you are doing.  Stay away from processed foods and sugary drinks.  If you want something sweet eat fruit.  You don't have to count calories but here is a calorie out calculator.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kanbike.org/pages/cal.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.kanbike.org/pages/cal.php</a>|`|PkDOw7dBaa	Edible ones...<br>  Me and my friends ride street bmx every day (In the summer) and we usually end up riding between 10-15 miles a day just getting to and from places. we just eat lots whenever we feel like eating. And we're all in pretty good shape, too.<br>  <br>  Dont buy into this calorie counting crap.<br>  <br>  If you start losing weight too fast, eat more.<br>  If you start gaining weight, eat less. <br>  Simple logic. No math skills or fancy online calculators needed.

AEzJHIz7aa	Ignoring for the moment the question of legality, it is conceptually possible.<br>  <br>  It isn't going to be anything as simple as filing down a single pin in most cases.  Regulating automatic fire has its own complexities.  Unless you're not worrying about controlling it.  In that case, you could turn almost any semi into an auto by converting it into an open-bolt weapon.  Just pill put the hammer and trigger, and glue or weld the firing pin in the forward position.  When you drop the slide on a loaded magazine, hold on tight!<br>  <br>  By the way, not only is that illegal, it's unsafe, particularly in larger caliber guns.  There's obviously no way to stop it from firing once it starts, and it also prevents the gun from locking into battery before it fires.  <br>  <br>  Consider this as a thought experiment only!|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Having a semi-auto pistol go fully automatic is, in fact, a problem which gunsmiths are taught to repair.  Certain parts can break with age.  But, as so many of the other posters have said, don't try to do such a conversion.  It would be totally uncontrollable unless you could  incorporate a two or three-round burst limiter.  And it's illegal.  There's no sense in getting your house burned down by the Feds for shooting too fast.|`|119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	Yes it is, however it is illegal like you said, and sense its illegal I cannot give out information on how to do it.  If you know about guns as far as completely disassembling them down to each individual pin, spring, etc. then you can easily do it.  However if you do so and get caught its a pretty nice size fine along with some jail time.  So unless you have an automatic weapons license I don't suggest you even attempt it for legality reasons.  Also, if you do that and get caught not only will you pay a fine, most likely go to jail, but you will no longer be able to legally own a gun the rest of your life.  <br>  <br>  I know, I know having a fully automatic weapon is fun, I've been in the military for 7 years I know how fun they are, but its just too big of a risk to attempt to make a civilian weapon fully auto.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	It's possible, but it's unsafe and definitely not worth going to jail over|`|0WTfwVvXaa	i used to here my grandpas friend talkin about it all the time but hes completly crazy and hes a bum but im pretty sure it can be done but its not that simple|`|SJVaJbsZaa	Its been done before.

b819b870c70c7d8b59b6b8a1323815e3aa	With regard to his stupid move, he did make a stand.  He admitted what he did was stupid and promised it would not happen again.    Regardless ... what he did was totally stupid and disappointing.  He is welcome to be a 23 year old, however, he is not welcome to be a stupid 23 year old.
SBzfbIU3aa	The opening pyro hit and here we go!    Shane McMahon's music hit and they came out to the ramp.     McMahon said Randy Orton's attorneys talked with him and that they didn't talk about injunctions and law suits, they said Orton wanted a match with him at No Way Out. Shane said he accepted the challenge. He said not only would he beat Orton, but he wanted to make sure Orton didn't make it to Wrestlemania.     Orton's music hit and he came out to the ramp and stared down Shane in the ring. He wondered if Shane ever stopped and asked himself 'how he did it'. How did he single handedly beat up the top three superstars in the WWE. He said the answer was simple. He didn't. He said the second he saw him lip quivering, he made a decision. He told Ted and Cody then and there not to fight back. Watch the tape, watch the footage. Sure they scuffled with him and tried to contain him, but they didn't fight back. He said he wasn't looking at him, but at the Raw roster, waiting for the opportunity to impress Shane or Stephanie. 20 on 3 wouldn't be happening.     He said he would be able to do to him what he wanted, with no consequences. He said he should call the hospital his father was in and he should order up a bed. Because after No Way Out, his father would have some company. Orton began to walk down the ramp a bit to tease some action and then decided against it.     He made it up the ramp a bit before placing the mic down and heading back to the ring. After an intense stare down, Rhodes and Dibiase sprung up from under the ring and Shane whipped out a kendo stick and fought them off. Orton pulled his accomplices from the ring and they stared down Shane, whose looking plucky in the middle of the ring.    ****Commercial*****    CM Punk & Mickie James v. William Regal & Layla    Regal slapped on a headlock and flat backed Punk with a shoulder block. Punk came back with a wheel kick and after some arm bar counters, Layla and Mickie are in the match. Layla hit a big right before mounting Mickie and landing a flurry of rights and lefts.    Mickie fired back with right forearms and a kick to the gut before popping out of a corner with a big clothesline. Punk and Regal are tagged in while Punk plants some big kicks into the chest of Regal. Regal tried to use Layla as a shield before Mickie cleaned her out allowing Punk to attempt a plancha. Punk crashed and burned and after taking a while to get into the ring, was met with a big Regal running knee to the head for the win.    Winners: William Regal & Layla via pin fall    ****Commercial****    Cody Rhodes & Ted Dibiase v. Cryme Tyme    JTG had his way with Ted Dibiase, knocking him back with a drop kick and hitting some sort of two handed face busted before Dibiase rolled through a cover attempt and booted JTG right in the face. Rhodes tagged in and landed some big punches before hitting some strikes to the back of JTG's neck and slapping on a neck vice.    Shaad eventually got the big hot tag and he cleaned house before hitting a power slam in the4 middle of the ring. Shaad hit a running elbow drop for a one count that was split up by Cody. Shaad went to work on Cody before Dibiase jumped him from behind. The two mugged the Cryme Tymer with strikes and got themselves DQ'd.    Winners: Cryme Tyme via DQ    The two put a pretty mean beat down on Shaad after the match before soaking in some boos from the crowd.     ****Commercial****    A video recap aired of the going ons between Micky Rourke and Chris Jericho in recent weeks.    Jericho's out in the ring waiting to give us some words of advice. Jericho attacked Rourke for being a liar and a back tracker. He slammed him and his movie before he said his movie sent the wrong message, that has beens didn't know when to hang it up. Jericho ran down disgraces like Rowdy Piper and Jimmy Snuka. He ran down Ric Flair as absolutely pathetic, putting down his autograph sessions and working with low-end web sites. Flair has a sickness and he's not alone. He said all of these 'legends' need to be put in their place. He is imploring the WWE to revoke their status as hall of famers, their status that allows them to leech off the business.    World Champion John Cena cut him off from the titan tron. He called Jericho an idiot. He said these guys should let go of the past, but he's the first one to get fired, still here, and he still won't shut up. He said every word he says makes him angrier and angrier. He said Jericho crosses the line too much. Cena says they have a match tonight, and while he won't make him get on his knees, he'll shut him up and knock his teeth down his throat.     ****Commercial****    Kofi Kingston & Rey Mysterio v. Kane & Mike Knox    Kofi was able to fight Kane off in the early going, sending him to the outside with a kick.    ****Commercial****    We came back to Kofi still trying to do his stick n move strategy with Kane. He tags in Rey and after some kicks, Rey tries to set him up for a 619. Kane kicks it out ofbut gets caught with a senton. Rey brought him back into the ring and tried for something, only to eat a big uppercut.    Knox tagged in and bullied Rey to the corner before whipping him to the corner. He missed the follow up and Rey hit some kicks. He charged at Knox and got scooped up for a power slam, but Kofi made a blind tag and flat backed Knox. Rey hit a double stomp and the boom boom leg drop for a two count.    Knox and Kofi tussled around for a while and after Kofi wiggled out of a power bomb attempt, Knox decapitated him with a big boot to the grill for a great near fall. Kane tagged in and hit a back breaker. After a slam to the corner, Knox tagged in and started twisting Kofi's arm off.     He gathered him and hit a big face buster before bringing Kofi |`|bGAv6Gjpaa	trash that what happen last night they crap all over the WWE fans with trash wow Y2J vs cena for 1000000 time and Jbl and HBK is getting to old and CM Punk vs Regal that what it was!  crap the show was like watching a big pile of cow dang just sit their WWE will get NO BUY for the PPV!

Overall, Booker T gets more main event matches in TNA and he gets what he needs.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	no, he is good for TNA|`|Tl76L4pkaa	No but I do wish that Kurt Angle and maybe Petey Williams could come to the WWE and I also wouldn't mind seeing how AJ Styles got on against the likes of Evan Bourne and Rey Mysterio...|`|h5lOMoqBaa	No, because he was not used right in WWE either.

It's exclusive to Smackdown, and is there anybody that is ever on Smackdown that even is a crusierweight besides Chavo Guererro? Is he the champion? Who even is? Hurricane Helms is, isn't he? I don't even know. They need to retire that thing. And the Divas are all a joke on SmackDown.|`|UbUSth5haa	I believe the WWE did kill the Cruiserweight division which is why the only focus in the WWE has always been the major championships such as WWF/E Championship, World Heavyweight, Undisputed (for a time) and Intercontinental (at a time) now you hardly every hear about the IC title or the US title because all the WWE carea about is the Main Eventers, and the Main Attractions.|`|cIHhxtRJaa	well after a while the division was still somewhat good in wwe but it did die. i've always felt the cruiserweight division was great to see, there were always very fast pace and exciting matches. I watch wwe everytime it's on but a lot of slow matches.|`|B3L9s74oaa	YES|`|NRs72Afxaa	Vince thinks the small guys don't make money. Look at Wcw, Mexico, and Tna.

Wcw cruserweight divison died when they putted the strap on Madusa, Daffeney, and Mike Simon. When Wwe had the cruserweight divison it died when they put the strap on Hornswoggle. <br>  <br>  The last good title reign is the X Division. I hope Tna doesn't put that strap on...Well their aint anybody bad right now.

I think just like Favre, he actually believes he can still play even at 37, but the difference between he and Farve, is that Warner actually played well this year.  But back to Warner, I don't think he will quit so soon.  He obviously has a lot left in him, and he wants to give Arizona another shot to at least get back to the super bowl.  The pieces are there already.  He just has to perform like he did this year.  But if he should go, then of course Leinert will step in.  I think Leinert will do ok, but from what we have seen, he isn't worthy of the title of a great QB.  He struggled in his first couple of seasons.  I think ithe best thing Leinart can do is learn from the pros.  He needs to take some advice from Warner instead of wasting his career on the bench.  As far as Dockett, I think he is  a quality DT.  He doesn't get a lot of recognition but he should.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that he plays for the Cardinals.  I think he is a reason why the Cardinals defense did so well this post season.|`|LgdaV360aa	who cares??? The Steelers wooped u !!!!!!! ha ha!!!|`|AA11105507	If Warner does not return to the Cardinals, Leinart will take over as the starting QB.  The Cardinals drafted him to be their QB of the future.  However, if Warner does end up staying with the Cardinals, don't expect Leinart to waste another year on the bench.  I'm sure he'll shop himself around to other teams.|`|5TOp9HhHaa	Right now, Matt Leinart is not as good as Kurt Warner. Playing Leinart would be a step backward for the Cardinals. In time, Matt might be ready, like Philip Rivers in San Diego. But next year? Too soon, I think. The Cards need to re-sign Warner. 2 year deal, play him 1 year and see how it goes. If Warner's play drops off, or Leinart shows he is ready, sit or release Warner after next season.    If Warner retires or leaves via free agency, I guess the Cards will have to go with Leinart. But they might want to pick up a veteran QB to back him up, maybe someone like Culpepper or Leftwich.    I'm just not sold on Matt Leinart right now. Maybe in another year, but not right now. The Cardinals need Warner, his chemistry with the receivers and his ability to read the blitz and lead the team.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	If the Cardinals lose Warner the team will plummet. Not only would they have absolutely no chance at making a repeat appearance in the Superbowl... they'd also have a hard time just making the playoffs. They would lose the edge that they have over the other NFC West teams and may not even repeat as division champs. Warner is the heart of this team... and without him, they are a below average team.     Dockett is a beast... he's actually a defensive end... and it would be a big blow to the Cardinals to lose him as well, however, it is easier to replace a defensive end than it is to replace a quarterback, so it would not be as big of a blow. If Warner stays and Dockett goes... the Cardinals will still win the division and possibly make another run in the post season... though regardless of what happens, I think back-to-back Superbowl appearances are out of the question for this team... it's just too hard to accomplish (for any team).|`|9sQ8OQqnaa	Leinart will replace him and they will make the playoffs and lose in the first round.|`|eKsgL2wkaa	Leinart becuase theyve already paid him a ton of money. But he's not nearly as good.|`|RSBBPYDWaa	Matt Lienart...there's nothing wrong with him. He got beat out by Kurt, and for good reason, Kurt took us to the Super Bowl.|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	Arizona Cardinals better do two things this off season.  They need to get Kurt Warner back and also re-sign Anquan Boldin.  If both of them don't come back, then it is back to the bushes with the Cardinals.  With Kurt Warner, the Cardinals is a contending team.  With Matt Leinart, they are an average team.|`|489d315755dd3d36b1b400515759a73caa	If Warner does not return next year then it will be in the hands of Matt Leinhert.  Well, that just means that the Cardinals will not be a contender next year as Matt Leinhert is not ready to lead the team I am sorry to say. He has alot of maturing to do ON and OFF the field..|`|ePeKSqrIaa	Party Boy would get the start and the Cardinals will go 7-9. Nothing special|`|ULw1777caa	Leinart, so don't expect a repeat of this year Cardinals fans.

9Zbh8HZxaa	Statistically yes! he will always dominate in stats M.V.Peyton Manning started all 16 games in 2004 but only played 14 out of respect for his team and Dan Marino . He would of had 52 if he would have played!<br>  Tom Brady went 16-0 and lost to a Manning HAHAHAHALMAO!<br>  and hasn't won a Superbowl in 4 years. Brady is a product of the system and has the highest paid O- line in the N.F.L.  look at how well Matt Casshole did ( he sucks without that O-line! ) Brady 75% in Superbowl's <br>  Manning's 100% in Super bowls|`|JTSNljLhaa	Brady 50 tds 16-0..Godly stats nuff said..now if u think manning is a better QB period i can eat you up on that topic too<br>  <br>  now i can give u alot of reasons why<br>  <br>  not to mention thats Brady first year with a great set of receivers..Manning had those good receivers for awhile<br>  also is Manning an everyday anytime QB? No..take Manning out of that comfy dome and put him out there in the rain and snow he will be a interception throwing machine..he cant play in elements(rainy weather against the Chargers he got crush 6 ints..6 ints in one game!! then i cant count how many he threw against the patriots<br>  <br>  Manning is a Dome(indoor QB)|`|nltFZcuGaa	no bradys 3 all star WR and dominant OLINE and spygate season was the best QB season statistically.|`|rvl2f6ERaa	heck yes|`|B8sJEBxTaa	To DWIGHT FREENEY<br>  <br>  "and hasn't won a Superbowl in 4 years... Brady 75% in Superbowl's <br>  Manning's 100% in Super bowls"<br>  <br>  Well these are obviously flawed statements. Brady won his first Super Bowl two years into his NFL career. Manning, however, won his ONLY Super Bowl almost ten years into his NFL career. Yes, Brady may be 75% in Super Bowls, but at least he went to four of them.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I do agree that Manning is the "better" QB, but Tom Brady has done more than Manning has. Despite being a sixth round pick, he was able to pick up three Super Bowl rings with a scrappy receiving core. I'm surprised that Manning doesn't light up the boards with Wayne, Harrison, and Clark (and now Gonzalez). Also, Manning gets the comfort of playing in a dome as someone else previously mentioned... Well if Brady got that luxury, then he'd be putting up better statistics.Yes, Manning is a very good QB, but Brady has done more with less.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  To DWIGHT FREENEY since you don't either do not allow PMs or have blocked me, obviously you should read before you turn on the caps button and unleash a torrent of crap unrelevent to the issue at hand. Anyways, if you know what quotes mean, I'm only targeting A SEGMENT of your information, NOT THE WHOLE THING. Like I said, Peyton is a good QB, but what has he done compared to Brady?|`|ZOHcbErHaa	Well, if you combine postseason and reg. season Marino had 56 tds to Bradys 56 tds, but Marino had over, I think 6,000 + passing yards. No one is combining the postseason to the reg. season to make a 19 game record - Marino '84 - 48 plus 8, Brady was 50 + 6. Manning did not make it to a 19 game schedule. There should be a 19 game record which leaves Marino and Brady tied, with Danny having way more passing yards. Let's go ESPN, give it some thought !|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Nope, Brady's was better<br>  <br>  EDIT: JJ is mad that his team can't beat the Patriots

tLLWMy7iaa	Shawn Marion is an excellent defensive player. He has long arms, excellent quickness, and his second jump (after he lands) is the quickest in the league. Bruce Bowen is a good defender, but not nearly as athletic as the Matrix (and not nearly as sportsmanlike).  Battier makes up for his lack in athleticism with pure hustle and knowledge of the game.

kYdxJGt6aa	I say no, they should not judge in tournaments if not familier with the styles. You are one of a handfull that have the honor to not judge and I thank you for taking a stance that many should take.<br>  I have seen people recieve an award for doing a kata that was just plain bad. I had lower ranked belts that could have performed the kata much better.<br>  I finally quit going to local tournaments because the judging was so bad. Same people judging and same people winning.<br>  Really the only tournament that I thought was judged good was the international tournament in Hamamatsu, Japan. They (judges) were sharp.<br>  Doing katas in competition or at the dojo is more than just knowing all the moves. It should be done with focus, power, speed and smoothness. Most judging seems to be focused on, if the person just knows the moves) not how well it's performed. That's just wrong.|`|sjHX2IbFaa	Real masters should have the ability to understand other styles but in a tournament setting it seems to be just too hard. You have no time to think about what the competitor was really trying to do. So my answer is that you should not mix judges and styles if possible.<br>  A big problem is the whole judging method. A show of hands? Number scores? How does this translate into a real indicator of performance? I have heard fellow judges say "that form was sloppy but did you see his reverse punch!?" What the he#L does that mean? Then the politics! NASKA is utterly ridiculous. I went to the battle of baltimore last year and It wasn't good at all.|`|oTb67zNYaa	an interesting point that I have thought about when concerning different forms of karate i would say no|`|YDpT2ClBaa	in an idea world yes you would want a judge that is the kata they are judging an some times you can get judges for that.<br>  <br>  but unfortunate it doesnt always workout like that. an experience judge can judge kata he is unfamiliar with from different styles, he can go by the persons form, focus, power, etc....as long as the system is similar to theirs<br>  it is the inexperienced judges that have problems with other styles and you need to keep out of those situations.<br>  i have judged a lot of kata over the years i didnt know, some traditional tournaments i was in if the person made a mistake a judge that was familiar with the kata would point it out.<br>  as for open and naska tournaments i have judge in many of them in the late 80's and early 90's and i mostly just go by the persons abilities. at least in the open divisions, the chinese division i never judged.<br>  now a days i only go to a few traditional tournaments and no longer go to the open ones <br>  in the weapons division there is always a kata i will come across i dont know, you need to be able to judge on how realistically the person is using the weapon.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	In a short answer - yes but there are issues at concern here. If they are a truly qualified black belt then they should have no problem basing a score on the best competitor regardless of their kata but you also have to realize this:<br>  <br>  1. Too many times black belts come in and judge who have no clue what they are judging...or have never been trained as officials (open events).<br>  <br>  2. Most black belts today do not know a good kata from a bad one and base their score on the wrong elements such as showmanship or the loudest yell which are not part of kata.<br>  <br>  3. Soft stylist prefer their type of form and hard stylist prefer theirs. In fairness a soft stylist should never be judging a hard stylist kata and vice versa but then again they should not even be in the same division...but too often that is the case.<br>  <br>  4. Many black belts today have crappy kata and there for they should never judge because they have no idea what to look for.<br>  <br>  The WKF has standardize grading of kata and which kata are permitted in competition which helps their association and events. The WTF has set standard rules for judging but they still base a lot of it on flash and not technique. <br>  <br>  The only true problem is to insure your center officials are never below an authentic 5th dan and that center official lays out the basis for judging based on the rules of the event...but that does not even work.<br>  <br>  I have competed all over the world in Kata and most of the time I finish in the top three but the scores are so widely varying it is not even funny. One time when I was competing in Australia I was given a 0 by one judge. When I asked him what I had done wrong he stated that I did not perform Sepai the way it was to be done...that was not a judging criteria so I complained and he had to change his score...which did not matter as I still had the best scores and won regardless...but it was the fact that he was evidently biased.<br>  <br>  Today I only compete on circuit as my student do as well. The rules and judging are the best I have ever seen and they separate the systems out by styles (TKD against TKD, Karate against Karate, Kung Fu against Kung Fu) for kata which is great. Then the best compete for grand champion.<br>  <br>  No matter what circuit, event or where you go you will always have good and bad judges, those with and without knowledge. You just have to make the best of it and shrug it off if the judge is an idiot...there are lots of them out there.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	It is up to the black belt to say I have no knowledge or not enough to judge in a division.  This continues to be a problem at smaller tournaments where as you have already mentioned they are at the mercy of who is there and is somewhat qualified to judge.  It is especially bad in the lower ranking and younger divisions as they tend to make sure that the black belt divisions have the best judges.  I have often said that the children's and lower ranking divisions should have five judges so that the judging is as fair as possible.  After all they are the future of martial arts.  With respect to some internal style like Tai-chi this continues to be a problem at smaller tournaments.  Some tournaments and NASKA national tournaments have their own divisions for this  They put soft style judges with experience and knowledge in those divisions just for this reason.|`|Yslq4OYhaa	I've asked this question to my Sensei many years ago. His response to me was that you don't have to know the kata to judge it. You can base your score on many factors such as stances, power, how fluid etc. Often it is easy to tell if someone makes a mistake. Their body language will give them away.<br>  <br>  I agree but I do not completely agree. <br>  <br>  I felt comfortable judge kata that were similar in style to our style of Shorin Ryu, but I do not feel the same way about kung fu styles that I saw in the same tournaments. I wasn't particularly impressed with the kata, but that did mean they did the kata incorrectly. Seeing a guy do a split in a kata or balancing on one leg with the other leg straight in the air above his head does not impress me in a fight. It does say a lot about his flexibility but if a kata is suppose to simulate a fight how does that fit into the equation? But I also understand this is in their kata, they also do back flips. Again to me that is useless. This again confirmed to me that I was not the person to judge those kata.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	When it comes to japanese/okinawan forms I can identify 50 kata and by variation their ryu and in a few cases differences between 2 dojo within the same ryu..Even tho I spent 2 years studying MONK FIST BOXING I wouldn't attempt to judge kung fu kata .<br>  Trouble is where and at what tournament are you going to find 5 or 6 qualified tai chi practioners as they are kind of rare.<br>  If the competitor wants to compete against other forms he takes his chances.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	Of course not, has that happened to you or someone you know?  Would you throw a training kids Tae Kwon Do sparring judge into an amature MMA judging position without him being trained to do so first?
D0f7uDtQaa	why dont u try it
D6M975deaa	Go to the pause menu and go to options or something like that and then put up fighting all the way to 100. Check somebody and then an icon will pop up and then just press select. Pretty simple if you're a hockey fan.|`|XyU7bGYOaa	why are you playing 2k? <br>  <br>  and 2008?<br>  <br>  and on a ps2<br>  <br>  not many people play that now.
5CLx01G1aa	He did nothing wrong. I think you are right, not everyone cares about money as much as A-rod, sometimes players are loyal like Sundin|`|AA10943884	My beef was that he thought he could make a difference and would be upsetting a team chemistry.  First of all, he was at best a number 2 center, he could never lead a team to success. All we ever heard was that Matts never had any wingers that could play with him when actually it was there were no wingers who wanted to play with him.  The one time he could have helped the franchise, he decided to stick it to them. Something about he wanted to stay with Toronto all year or some BS crap like that. Yet his stats in the last games of the year were always the same.  Very little production on a lot of ice time.  Now you understand partially what he did wrong. Selfish, overrated hockey player.|`|ROWSzTknaa	Mats even confided in other hockey players exploring every option possible when the Toronto Maple Leafs tried to kick him out of town last season. It must have been hurtful for him after all he did for the organization and he never said a word. He did not want to go to another team at the time for the very fact of saying he did not want to be a rental player and he has always been true to his word. For once Mats did what he thought was right for him. People have to focus more on the positive aspects of Mats Sundin's career in Toronto and what he did for the team over the years instead of the steady decline of their precious Leafs for once.|`|etErp8rcaa	I think if he had made the decision right at the start of the season, the only people who would have had a problem with it would have been the die-hard Leaf nation. Sundin probably spent a long time considering his options, as the Rangers and Canadiens were both rumored to be very interested in him.<br>  <br>  In terms of what he did wrong, it's considered bad form to join a team when you're that far into the season. You're out of the swing of things in terms of training, and you're taking ice time away from guys who have made the commitment to the team from the beginning of the season. Last year, Selanne and especially Neidermayer got a fair bit of flak for doing the same thing with the Ducks. In Sundin's case, it wasn't as big a deal because the Canucks at least had the cap room to sign him without  trading anyone.<br>  <br>  By all accounts, it takes time to get acclimatized to the way a given NHL team plays. When you sign up in mid season like that, you're messing with the system a little.|`|8m9HXnPfaa	Ill give you this analogy...<br>  <br>  He pulled a Brett Favre. He deserted his team, and signed with another team just for the big bucks. It was selfish because I feel he was disloyal to his team, and I understand how some leafs fans must feel (and I am a HABS fan).<br>  <br>  Same thing with Favre, you left the packers to join NY. I love the guy, feel like he is one of the best QBs to ever play in the NFL, and after going through a drug problem, losing his father, etc... he just left GB. I felt it was cheap, but I still admire him.<br>  <br>  What is worse with Sundin is that he was just playing/manipulating the NHL. He said hed come back at the beginning of the season, then after a month, then after 2, then after christmas, etc... He was like "Oh look at me, Im so good, anyone want to offer me a contract and Ill see who offers me the most." Plus he isnt THAT good. He is a good player, but far from a GREAT player. The guy has no heart, no love for the game, its all about the money.|`|AA11674745	I think a lot of the carping was due to diehard Toronto Maple Leaf/Mats Sundin fans who were hurt by his departure. Nothing wrong with that. If my favorite player moved out of town I'd probably let him have it.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that half the world loves him and the other half wants nothing to do with him. Then too, was all the hubub about whether he was going to continue his career in Toronto or elsewhere - which, so far, turned out to be much ado about nothing.<br>  <br>  I recall reading about Sundin-to-Philly rumors and I was among those who felt the Flyers didn't need an aged, past-his-prime, attention junkie trying to get his last best paycheck.
AfVJAjjTaa	that's a tough question.  Johnson and Hill are cooling off, but Vidro hasn't done anything so far.  Vidro is available at 1B(in yahoo, not sure about ESPN), so that might help you.  I'd probably pick up Johnson, he leads off for a very good team.<br>  <br>  I was going to suggest that you drop a SP for more offense, but there's no SP that I would drop.  Because of your talent surplus with starting pitching, maybe try to trade a SP for a 2B?|`|21wb5N6Kaa	I'm not a Braves fan so don't think I'm prejudice, but I would have to say Kelly Johnson. He will continue to hit somewhere around .280 -.295 and score many runs with the occasional HR or SB! He is better for the long haul in my opinion.|`|AA11196515	Get Hill or Kelly, you decide who to get, but one of those two. Vidro might have a hight batting average but Hill and Johnson are lot more reliable.
EGe0k8P6aa	Without knowing what gun you have (and the corresponding muzzle velocity and pellet/BB you're shooting) I can only speak in generalities. In general BB pistols don't have enough power to hunt small game. A BB pistol with a typical muzzle velocity of 350 fps shooting a 5 grain BB generates 1.36 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. On the other hand a pellet pistol that shoots an 8 grain pellet at 600 fps has 6.4 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. To kill a rabbit (or other similarly sized animal) requires 5 ft-lbs of impact energy. A BB pistol never generates that level of power. However a pellet pistol might kill a rabbit (at no more than 15 yards or so) provided you were able to perfectly place your pellet.<br>  <br>  If it is legal in your state/province/shire to hunt rabbit with an airgun, you should really look into an air-rifle (like the pump Crosman 2100 and Benjamin 392, the spring-piston Gamo Big Cat and RWS 34 Panther, or the pcp like the Benjamin Discovery) instead of an air-pistol. An air-rifle will have more power and be more accurate.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, in order to hunt waterfowl (at least in the United States), you need a shotgun between 10 and 20 gauge.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	A single shot 20 ga or a .410  could be found in many pawn shops and gun shops for less than $100. These are a very good way to start learning how to handle a gun and still have a gun you could use for hunting what you describe.  Find a gun club near you and take a gun safety course and also do some target shooting.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	I would get more instruction before going into the woods . A hunter safety course would be a good place to start. Also a bb gun is for tin cans not game I would invest in a good 20ga shotgun like a remington 870 pump .You could get one for about $250.00 to $300.00 new .But most import of all is to be safe and learn all you can about hunting and firearms before you go into the woods. Your local gun club should be able to help you out.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Sorry no * Wait until you are a little older so you can use the proper gun for hunting small or big game.*|`|M6fzLJtmaa	you want a .22 i would go with a 10/22, cheap, fun and great for what you want.|`|BpyZUhK6aa	NOOOOOO IT WILL NOT!!!!|`|0WTfwVvXaa	U can get a very afordable air rifle from walmart its very easy to use its like $120 its a break barrel rifle i have taken a large duck down with one of these if u get a good shot on any rabbit itll be a one shot i highly recomend this for kids and begginers ima a kid and i love it|`|AA10927198	first take a course.  bb wont kill anything.  is not strong enough. it will jsut hurt the animal.  use a small shotgun with shells appropiate for the game.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	NO a bb gun maybe a shotgun loaded with bb

c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I've got a lot of hope for the Royals.  The AL Central isn't very good this year and all the teams should really be able to contend for 1st place in the division.  If the Royals can get a breakout season from Gordon or Butler and have either Kyle Davies, Luke Hochevar or Haracio Ramirez have a good season on the mound then they'll be a team to watch out for.  They won't win 100 games, but 88 games might win the division this year.  On the same note, if guys like Butler, Gordon, Aviles and Greinke regress it could be a horrible season.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Well, coming from the NL West, I think the Rockies have a good chance.<br>  All the teams are fairly even going into the season, looking at the acquisitions and all.|`|Ch40nAvCaa	Every fan should have faith in their team, especially after what happened with the Rays last year.

However, if wrestling school was that easy then everybody would sign up and eventually be drafted into the WWE.

The draft episode is always a good boost in ratings and is fairly unpredictable, which is always a good thing for the show.  The only problem is that every draft has brought about the end of someone's (or multiple people's) career...  The reason being that they like to break up tag teams during the show, because they seem to think that's an unpredictable move, and usually one or both members of the team become useless due to it.    Personally, there's a shallow set of people I'd like to see moved.    To Smackdown:  Chris Jericho - Jericho has done mostly everything he can do on Raw, solely because there's no way he could be the top heel on the show now that Orton and JBL have that marker.  Smackdown could finally see their top heels in the form of Jericho and Edge...  Evan Bourne - As much as people want to see him on Raw, putting him on Smackdown for the US title would be a better push for the young gun.  He's got talent, and putting him in matches with Shelton Benjamin, Brian Kendrick, and Jaff Hardy...  it could really make his career, as long as they keep his push serious.  Kane - Kane is one of those guys that you never know what to do with.  He's a monster, but he doesn't have the drive to actually win anything...  bouncing him around to the show where EVERYONE is big could be the one thing that's keeping him from really being the monster he should be...  and who knows, maybe he'll pick a side (heel or face) to be on?  Manu - Umaga is stale.  Plain and simple.  But Manu needs something to do.  So why not pit Umaga and Manu together, and make them into a new wild samoans?  Umaga could be the size and Manu could be the mouth.  After all...  both are a failed gimmick waiting to happen anyway!    To Raw:  MVP - MVP needs to find his stride again to be taken seriously...  how about a sudden draft to Raw where he can "renegotiate his contract."  With Steph in charge, and an IC title that has no real competition, he could be a huge bonus for the show.  DH Smith - He has no gimmick, and no story.  But he has a buttload of talent, and the look.  Have him and Natalya make an alliance on Raw, maybe even shortly teaming with the Legacy, only to have them turn because they don't believe Orton's ideals?  It could make a good face out of the babyfaced kid.  Natalya - Natalya has no BFF anymore, and could really use a step in a new direction...  say a REAL match against someone like Beth Phoenix, Melina, or Mickie James?  Put her with Smith and see where the new generation Hart Foundation could take them.  Finlay - If there was anyone that had a big following before disaster hit him, it was Finlay...  and that disaster was Hornswaggle.  That midget may be fun to watch, but it definitely takes away from the severe superstar Finlay could be.  Have him turn heel on his "kid" and then get drafted to Raw.  That shilelagh would be a great advantage in the IC title hunt.    To ECW:  Scotty Goldman - Goldman has the mouth and the talent, but doesn't have the look or the push.  But given more speaking time on ECW (as he can out talk everyone on the show) and some good feuds with Ricky Ortiz, Jack Swagger, and Tommy Dreamer?  He could possibly make for a decent heel turn becoming Swagger's lackey...  and then finally be useful on a show.  Hurricane Helms - Another guy who came back to little sizzle and all fizzle...  Helms is a great talent that is highly underused.  He just came back as a face, but has been given zero push, because of his size.  On ECW he could be the next big face...  taking Matt Hardy's spot as the "ring veteran" and the fact that he can talk a lot better than Matt, and you have the premier face of the federation...  provided he gets good matches against Burchill, Miz, and Swagger.  Rey Mysterio - Don't get me wrong, but I think that ECW should be made up of what Smackdown and Raw don't like to push...  and that's people who wrestle better than they speak.  Get Mysterio in that ring with Helms, Goldman, Burchill, Swagger, Miz, Morrison...  it could be dynamite on a television screen.    That's my hopes for the draft.  Maybe the WWE will listen?|`|e6TcpDcxaa	yh there will be a draft it has happened for the last 3 years

I'm not sure if you have 6 weeks to prepare, but it should give you some good insight either way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I think you'll enjoy the race!<br>  Michele<br>  <a href="http://buzz.prevention.com/community/cook-it-up" rel="nofollow">http://buzz.prevention.com/community/coo...</a>|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	make sure that you limber up first!

One of the worst things you can do is to get stuck behind like one-hundred runners and waste energy going slower than you need to. Once you find your "place" within a pack of runners, go at a what I like to call a "chill race pace" - go at a good pace that feels fine but is also fast enough to keep up with the runners you need to keep up with. |`|AA11811364	Conservatively.   Since you don't provide any details on your ability or training, no way to give you a good solid answer.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to run the same pace from start to finish, so calculate your expected finish time, then calculate and memorize your splits.  If you don't know how fast that is, you can practice that speed at the track once you've made the calculation.<br>  <br>  If you've never run 5K for time, then remain conservative but depending on how you feel when you get your splits you can always adjust to slower or faster.  Of course, when you smell the finish line, you run full energy to the end.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  |`|zSkVptB9aa	Start with 4 days a week and build up to 30-min. of nonstop running at a pace that you can do at about 655 effort. After that has been accomplished,add in some strides after these run on 2-3 days. Each stride should be at 800-meter race pace, with a 15-20 sec. rest between each stride.<br>  <br>  Week 3: Add a 5ht day of running to your schedule. And try to get all your runs up to 45-min. long. <br>  <br>  week 4: Remove your 45 min run on Tuesday and replace it with 800-meter intervals for conditioning. And your Thursday run will become your weekly Tempo Run. But for week 4, it will be a 2-mile time trail for time. When you do it, have someone keep time for you and write it down. You will be using that same pace for the pacing of week 5's Tempo Run. So you want to run you 2-mile time trail as fast as  possible for your current level of fitness. <br>  <br>  week 5 <br>  Tues 4x800 meters with 2min rest<br>  Thurs 3-mile tempo your at you 2mile race pace time from week 4. This course should be exactly 3-miles long and as flat possible, because you want to run a fast pace. This will retrain your Fast-Twitch muscle fibers to fire-off faster than they do now.   <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your 5k training|`|sxlJs8lVaa	Just go for it, don't start to fast allot of runners start their first mile to fast(including me) pick up your speed towards the end of, maybe a mile, You probably have to sprint 800 so i'm sure you can keep quite a good pace for at least a mile.|`|se8SXdUVaa	if u are already a runner u must be knowing about the warm up which is the most important part.<br>  after that just start at a normal pace(abour 10-12 kmph) n dont run the full distance the very first day.start with 2-3 and stay with that for 1.5 weeks.dont forget to concentrate on speed training aswell to reduce ur time.u know better about that as a 800 m runner. do speed and running on alternate days.1 day full rest<br>  i hope it helps|`|5Azscj72aa	I am a 800 and 400m runner in track. In xc, start out at a faster pace than your 5k race pace for about 200 meters, then slow down to a nice pace that you know you can keep for 2 miles. The last mile, you just speed up and give it everything you have. |`|HDAYPSaGaa	make sure you do your warm up exercises first and then a slow jog to start with and build your pace up until you fell comfortable and keep to that pace   good luck |`|XavbWtU1aa	start of at a normal pace. dont start of sprinting.

Anyway, Candice is nothing but a Playboy Pornstar.<br>  <br>  Her wrestling skills rate about the same as Michelle McCool for me.<br>  She's only there because she's willing to take everything off. |`|HvnFTNmCaa	By WWE standards yes.<br>  <br>  By MAG's standards absolutely not!|`|NG5mOGsUaa	I don't know about deserve but I dfinitely do not think she is going to win |`|IzgJpVgBaa	i think so yea
hTruYNUQaa	The incident is still being investigated by police until he is proven,guilty he is innocent.    With what happened with Didak & co last year,if there was any wrongdoing with the player in question i'm sure the club will take the appropriate action.    Soon as an AFL player walks outside there front door and FARTS it seems to be in the news headlines.|`|YcvKwRqiaa	Well I seriously doubt he'll be the last AFL player to be involved in some sort of controversy. Anyways. Until he's proven guilty, and even if he is, everyone's human.    Edit. There you go. A Lions player in trouble now.|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	You have to have a certain toughness to play for Collingwood we dont have any whimps or sooks pulling on black an white stripes. We have had the same drinking problems as every other club Collingwood players just dont take s* t on the street|`|mXFOru11aa	nope it actualy dosn't|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	Maybe it occured due to Eddie's restrictive rules on players =).|`|xmg9CBnCaa	hes a victorian. that explains everything.|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Defiantly not he plays for Collingwood|`|4wRyTY9Raa	I'm amazed any player from any club goes out their front door,  if the kid in question was defending himself then that's fine i reckon, some fools out there like to take pot shots at AFL footballers to make themselves look big.   Surely after last years crap with the Shaw's and didak, players at collingwood would know better, well you'd think so any way, give him the benefit of the doubt until the full story is known, from both parties involved.|`|2s244jGgaa	Any young player that gets themselves in trouble surprises me, and it sucks that an incident like that gets so much media attention, especially if its a collingwood boy.|`|ZEdKJSblaa	It kinda dissapoints me actually, i dont know Ryan that well but i do know he would never do anything like that ever! Collingwood had better pick up their act.|`|VLCUDZlcaa	predictably everyone jumps on the speculation bandwagon and make stupid assumptions based on NOTHING!    The incident is still being investigated for fk sake.so why assume that it was Cooke was the trouble maker.    Collingwood are taking not action coz Cook was just defending himself - enough said !
O6WSs2s5aa	um yea she rocks shes da best|`|AA11105507	Maryse is smokin' hot!|`|4tvI9WYjaa	she not only is hot but she can wrestle unlike some divas she should pose for the cover shot at wrestle mania
O6WSs2s5aa	yea its all true and Orton will kick shanes rear end|`|JRGttmejaa	yes they said on raw|`|SBzfbIU3aa	Yes its true,  on raw last nite[2/2/09] shane mcmahon challenged randy orton to a no holds barred match at no way out 2009, and randy accepted!    personally i wanted randy to be in the elimination chamber bt he'll get his chance at wrestlemania!|`|7AV9pFCDaa	its gone be a no holds barred match    check this site http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/matche...|`|AA12394248	yea they are going against each other at nwo. but i say that sim snuka and manu will help shane keeping priceless from getting involved in the match. then another second or third generation superstar will get involved in the match. it would be nice if shane won to get some pay back but i think orton well win. the difference make the other 2 or 3 gen. superstar. i think it will be dh smith.|`|ICpXv2XDaa	it should be a five star match like the past street fights/no holds barred matches shane has been in... examples: shane vs vince at wm 17, shane vs kurt angle at king of the ring 2001, etc... shane to me doesn't have the same in ring ability has he had back in the day but this still should be a fun match to watch... i predict randy rko's him onto a steel chair and wins it, it would be sick if shane did a dive off the steel structure like he did at backlash 2001 against the big show... anyways thats just my opinion, btw i think wwe is making slight improvement in getting wrestling back to the mainstream|`|F3VjJAdiaa	yes, the lameness continues with orton vs shane at no way out, some kind of no DQ match.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	Yes it is true, shane vs randy orton is a no holds bar or no dq match.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	yes is true it was announced on raw that shane McMahon return to the ring to face randy orton in a no hold barred match at no way out it going to be awesome match|`|AA11482019	That's what they said last night, but I'm not sure it will take place.  They might change it and say that Shane ruptured his kidney or something when Orton kicked him.  Who knows?|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I'm over 90% certain the match will happen.    With last night's events, I doubt it will remain just a no-DQ match.  I expect the stipulation to change to a Last Man Standing match.    Personally, I don't care what the match is, just as long as Orton emerges victorious in a one-sided bout.  After all, his opponent is a McMahon.|`|bSsBGrZVaa	YEAH ITS TRUE AT NO WAY OUT ITS GOING  TO BESHANE MCMAHON VS RANDY ORTON IN  A NO HOLDS BARRED MATCH

nxymxSUFaa	It would not be a good trade for the Yankees.  Fukudome did not live up to expectations.  I don't see him as anymore than a journeyman player with "okay" ability.  The Yankees don't need another outfielder.  They have great players.  It's up to Joe to make it work.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	why not. cubs dont need him. nick swisher can fit okay for the cubs, but their will be some switches for the cubs though. i think this trade gives the yankees an okay bench player and gives the cubs a replacement for fukudome. so, its a good trade.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	No, they have done enough this offseason.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	No i don't like like trade i want Swisher to stay he has a Paul Oniell quality about him i think he'll do very well with the yankees i think he'll excell quite nicely. and we really don't need another outfielder.|`|yk4S7uuraa	They don't need to go that route. This guy is not going to make it in MLB, he needs to go back to Japan.|`|TCehI17kaa	Nope. Don't see that happening.|`|lp4wajLxaa	Fukudome trade rumors are exactly that, rumors.  The Cubs are not going to part with Fukudome because of a bad rookie season.  They've invested too much in him to just give up after one bad season.  Not to mention a season where he had a new team, new country, new city, new language, new game, more talent and longer seasons.  Also the Mariners have already offered Erik Bedard for him, so why would we take a step back from that for Swisher or Kennedy.<br>  <br>  To the guy above me, we don't need a replacement for Fukudome.  We have Soriano in left, Reed Johnson in center and Bradley in right.  Where exactly does Swisher fit into this? Fukudome is a bench player for us as well, at least for now.|`|AA10263761	If we Can get a Box Of Cookies for Ian Kennedy I Would Be Happy|`|V2RNpIFZaa	they can go ahead and try but the cubs would be retarded to make that trade I would take fukudome over both those guys anyday|`|iz5zDFxvaa	No! Besides, Swisher produces more HRs and RBIs than Fukudome|`|ad3M8wViaa	Yeah, lets take on another overrated outfielder.|`|8RQifraJaa	No. Swisher is a solid hitter that puts up better power numbers than Fukodome.|`|wkpLvAntaa	I dont really care for the Yankees, so no.

hVqGuOOPaa	Matt Hardy hit Jeff Hardy in the head with a steel chair at the Royal Rumble. It all started in the middle of Jeff Hardy's match against Edge for the WWE Championship belt. Jeff was about to get the win, when Vickie Guirerro came out and pulled the referree out of the ring....again. Then Jeff was all like "What just happened" and stuff like that. That's when Jeff's brother Matt Hardy came out with a steel chair in hand. He gave it to his brother Jeff and right as he was going for a whack at Egde's head, Matt stopped him and got another steel chair. So Jeff put his chair underneath Edge's head and Jeff was waiting for Matt to hit Edge in the head so that his head would be smashed between two steel chairs. All the fans went crazy and that's when the most unexpected thing in the world happened: Matt hit Jeff in the head with the steel chair instead of hitting Edge in the head with the steel chair. After that, Matt left the ring to go backstage and Edge took the win. At Smackdown later that week, Matt came out to confront the audience and he was booed to the ring. He told everyone that he did what he did because he never got as much appriciation as Jeff always got from the audience and he was sick of it. All of the fans were really mad at him for what he did because Jeff was unable to fight for a few of the shows. And in the ECW before that Smackdown, Teddy Long (the general manager of ECW) said that Matt Hardy asked for his realease from ECW to go to Smackdown. Matt Hardy also said that he is now no longer Jeff's brother and no longer considered a "Hardy."|`|5iFsy1Dlaa	matt hardy turned on jeff by hitting him with a stell chair and costing him his first title he won. the rason he turned on him was cause he is tired of jeff hardy making mistakes and having matt hardy to worry like he did and he is tired of the fans liking jeff way better than him when he has been trying his best to get the fans to like him.matt hardy thinks the fans are unfair cause he has been taking care of jeff hardy and the fans like jeff thats what matt said.|`|sntzyTdPaa	well it's a long story. matts ego was too big u know cuz jeff was gettin a lot more than him (jealous) well he just hit him over the head with a chair when jeff was about to win a championship and yeah so they've been fighting....but they're brothers. thats what they do they fight all the time! it'll pass...oh and it's kinda fake by the way they talk at home they live near each other its just a show! :)        watch wrestling tonight!!!!!!!|`|TefoBPyyaa	matt thot that he was always there to save jeff and he was gettin mad abt it and took a chair 2 jeff's bak but i remember that jeff used 2 save matt all the time it is jst another stupid argumnt between 2 good frnds like sting and kurt but kurt is being so disrespectful to sting i think matt did it just 2 take evry1's mind off of him losing the ecw title i can keep u updated if u wnt|`|bLxPLVNJaa	jeff hardy finally lived his dream and became wwe champ but he defended it against edge in no holds barre and matt hit hardy in the face and now no more hardyz because of matts responsibilitiess|`|97c1329c278548b5b2b2bb24b34d291eaa	well FRAME got in matts way he lost his belt so he help egde beat jeff|`|dUV60TThaa	what 2K9 NBA said.|`|eXZ5O8vdaa	what 2k9 nba said.|`|pa4iC5Nkaa	What?

And Stone Cold Steve Austin is  2, becuase he has got that attitude and the best perform in the wrestling buisness today.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	My fave tend's to vary quite alot right now it's homicide because he's a ring veteran and has plenty of great macthes in ROH. I haven't been able to wcath all of those macthes but i've seen some and there's no doubt in my mind that he's got skill and knows how to wrestle well. You should wacth his macth against CM Punk in YouTube, love that macth. No to forget he's a master of a deadly finisher called the cop killah also known as the Vertabreaker. And people say RKO is the best fiinisher pleassseee, anyways that's my favourite for you.

ES8Ta3Wuaa	yes i am from Michigan i have been watching them since i was a little kid and when ever they had a new player they always worked with him and always found a way to make it to the playoffs and with Allen Iverson he adds a whole new element the pistons never had offense they have always been a defensive team and with at least one offensive player they can have a scorer and a guy they can trust with 10 seconds left and down 1 possession so i do think that the pistons will make the playoffs and be a 4 or 5 seed and they will make it to the conference finals again and maybe win it and or the championship! GO PISTONS!|`|WLXFAeSnaa	If the take out A.I. out of the starting line-up, and put RIP in instead, they would start playing better.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I think their record will be 47-35|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	Iverson needs to get his @ss coming off the bench. start Hamilton and Stuckey like you said.

The winner from each match, depending on what brand they are on, get a draft pick. So say Orton wins for RAW, then Raw gets a draft pick. It's so that they can keep story lines fresh. Some superstars, divas, and announcers move from roster to roster and some stay with the brand that they were already on|`|3nN1vTTuaa	where they have matches on raw, with representatives from raw, smackdown, and ecw. Winners of the matches got a "random draft pick. They picks were predetermined by vince of course.|`|soANewLnaa	where some of the wrestlers switch brands|`|MHDUDTQfaa	The WWE Draft is when a wwe superstar going from his roster to an another roster..

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure he's a very talented and charismatic wrestler.Sting is an icon of the WCW and works an excellent style of technical powerhouse wrestling.He can put on an exciting match and cut entertaining promos and in-ring segments.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGlTxWAhE6Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGlTxWAhE...</a>|`|WQGvE60waa	Sting was better in WCW..<br>  <br>  He made his legend there and it should have died there.<br>  <br>  I remeber one of his best matches was against Goldberg and Goldberg was about to tap but Kevin Nash interfered. Sting was going to be the one to originally end theoverrated Goldberg streak ..<br>  <br>  Sting was WCW'S Bret Hart IMO<br>  <br>  thats an honor|`|cjknXzm9aa	he will go down as one of the all time greats. i'd like to see him come to wwe and thank his fans, then have orton and his legacy attack him. this way kids of this generation can watch sting just defy the odds abd beat everyone and be the ultimate hero. he would have two matches one to dispose of orton and another against hbk. that match would be epic. then sting could retire.|`|e22b2bed2f6a9243c0dbb45697641a53aa	when he was in wcw he was cool but now he's just old and should follow flair and retire already|`|h5lOMoqBaa	He's decent, but he's a shadow of what he was in NWA/WCW|`|3nN1vTTuaa	i think his mic skills are fading.|`|Lv89kHKpaa	Better than Angle|`|127uWOWRaa	he is Sting of the Ring<br>  lol

5PzkbS9Kaa	You want to enfisize the "flick" it is the most important part. First you want to practice flicking your ankle.

Also flick off the corner of the board also known as the lip of the board i hope i helped. fell free to message me
gwUq6HMUaa	Who knows? Baseball season is full of surprises.|`|v9bTfQGMaa	I actually think the A's can do it. I'm sorry, but I really don't think the Mariners can do it. First, Ken Griffey is only one person, you also got rid of Ibanez and Putz, and also gaining one person can't lead you to the WS (Or win the Division), especially if you play like last year. Also, I see them possibly coming in last (sorry, but who knows, I could be wrong). Also, the A's got rid of some players and coaches that were not doing good and ruining their chances of going far, and gaining some great players and some offense which is what we need. I think they will be close with the Angels. They seem to have lost more than gain.|`|utTFiz3gaa	who knows?<br>  <br>  its a toss up really i am not too confident on the angels although i am full of hope and excitement for the up and coming season. Oakland is stronger, Texas is always strong offensively and they just need a couple of pitchers to be a contender.. and angels are not the same team as last year (on paper). Could be competitive and hey competition never hurt anyone i honestly think its more fun when its down to the wire. much better than a team winning and being way too complacent and utterly failing in the playoffs which seems to happen to the angels quite often these past few years -__-;<br>  <br>  best of luck this season :)<br>  <br>  p.s. i'm so glad Griffey's back as a Mariner he's one of my personal favorites ;D|`|0L04Fm4Yaa	I have no clue I am an LA fan but i think its really going to be one of the interesting divisons cause it can go to anyone really texas got a good line up and gels pitching and oakland got better, not sure about seatle sorry i dont really pay attention to them =\|`|AA12040384	"we got Ken Griffey Jr Back"<br>  <br>  uhh..you know,your not getting the Griffey you had in the 90's.lmfao.The 2000's version of Griffey cant make those catches anymore and certainly doesn't have the same speed as he once had.|`|V2RNpIFZaa	I would say the angels again but it is going to be close, mariners have a solid pitching squad at times but at times they get into slumps and i agree griffey could inspire the team kind of like tony clark and the dbacks so that gives them an edge but the a's also just got giambi back so idk but if i had to bet i would say angels first mariners second and a's third then the rangers last|`|8RQifraJaa	It has to be the Angels. They have the best starting rotation. They still have an excellent bullpen. They did lose some offense with the departure of Texiera. But they were never a great offensive team. Pitching and defense is the reason they have been on top for the last few years. And Griffey is a shadow of his former self right now. He still might put up decent numbers but not enough to carry the team. And they lost their closer Putz to the Mets. I think that Oakland will finish second. And the Mariners will battle with Texas for the third spot.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Mariners will be terrible again.  Oakland and LAA will battle for the division.  Only way Mariners will be decent is if Beltre gets back on the roids and Felix Hernandez wins 30 games.  Eric Bedard is coming off an injury.  He will stink again.  Not to mention his teammates hate him.  Jr is old.|`|EwIR2Ivoaa	A lot of people like Oakland.  The Mariners are a mess, Griffey is just back as a last hurrah to finish his career where it started.  Anaheim doesn't really have anyone in the middle of the lineup replacing Teixeira.|`|jLalpJbAaa	this is a tough decision but i gotta go with the angels but i think its goin to come down to the end of the season...mariners are very good this yr so it could go either way|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	The Angels will win the west with the A's coming at a close second. The other two teams I don't care about.|`|fQIxah8laa	Nope. It's the Angels all the way. They basically own that division sorry to tell you. And no I'm not a fan of them, But I do like to watch the team at times. But I will tell you one thing, The A's made some spectacular moves this off season. So I pick them as my Darkhorse to win the AL West.  You never know, it might pay off.
Qlo4ZWGraa	Q: Who wins?<br>  A: The District Attorney.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Cha-Ching!  Gotto go with Money May.  Speed kills, and without a glove, Floyd would machine gun a couple shots faster than Sherk can react and it'll be over.|`|342e56bc9ac26ffd7479d53bae43615faa	Whoever made that retarded remark about boxers automatically being beat by mma fighters in the street better think twice. Obviously they have never been in a fight themselves. One punch to the timple and anybody goes down. I've seen many an MMA fight that ended with one quick punch. Many MMA fighters can't box at all and thats why they get linked on so quickly. It basically comes down to who gets the drop on who first. That being said Mayweather is no street fighter and in this instance he would lose but Sherk would have to get past his entourage first|`|0S0wRN0haa	Sean Sherk an MMA fighter would have the advantage over a small guy like Mayweather also Mayweather is a sleek fighter not a brawler like Hatton.|`|NSgSaspAaa	Street fight:  Sherk<br>  MMA fight:  Sherk<br>  Boxing:  Mayweather

RX5t6x6Haa	you have $160 to spend on a marker but you dont have $60 for a nitro tank? are you sure that your co2 tank is full? it sounds like its empty, just another reason to get a nitro than... you'll always know what pressure your at....<br>  <br>  EDIT: that kid that says that co2 works just as good at nirto/HPA/compressed air (it's all the samething) shoot HPA in 30 degree weather and shoot it at 80 degree weather their will be a fluxuation of maybe 30fps, try that with co2, you crono your marker in at 30 degrees, shoot it at 80, you'll probably be shooting in the 500fps at least and the co2 tank will probably be pushing out over 1000PSI, try speedball once kid, i garentee you within one game you will change over to HPA.... if co2 is just as good as HPA, how come ALL the pros use HPA??|`|QTd8MVDjaa	You aren't supposed to use CO2 on the Vibe, especially if it isn't anti-siphoned. Whats happening is the liquid in the CO2 is getting into the electronics, shutting it down. You have to get an HPA (nitro) tank or you're gonna really mess up the gun. You can find $50 HPA tanks online. Just look around. If you don't get an HPA tank you'll have to pay alot more to fix or replace your gun.|`|sR3SUZC0aa	im going to get a ton of thumbs down on this one, but i have 3 hpa bottles cause everyone told me co2 wont work in my guns. so like a retard i went and got it. and i didnt like it. so its more consistant who cares that tiny bit isnt making much difference. i dont ust any anti siphon tubes. and i have my own co2 fill station. and i put co2 in my hpa bottles now. your gun will freeze up but not after 10 shots. i can run hopper after hopper through my invert mini. through a case of paint had it for 2 years on co2 and no problems. book says not to use co2 on it but it works for me for 2 years now. hpa is just whats hot right now. there will be something else come along and people will be telling you not to use hpa. i remember people using nitrogen what happened to that. ill be glad when they figure out propane on a automatic paintball gun. kinda like the cp3. wich i also own. and love but its a pump

Many people have probably allready told you this before but its preatty much the most important skill to have. If you are looking to be the star of the show by taking people one and one and making them look average against you then i would work on different moves like stepover, mathews etc.
AA10263761	They Made a 09<br>  2K Hasnt made another college game|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Probably since College isn't as exciting as Pro.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Probably because no one cares about college baseball.  No offense to the people who do, but the general public doesn't care.  You barely ever see college baseball games on tv like you do with hoops and football, and its just not really marketable.  Most of the real good prospects are drafted out of high school, so you're not really getting the top talent level, not to mention those players that you do see playing, if they ever make the majors it wont be for another 4 years, so the players really arent big names that anyone cares about.  Minor league baseball would probably be more marketable than college tbh.|`|5m9An5rTaa	I like them also. Its probably one of those things where college baseball isn't as popular as Pro so It didn't sell very well. I really liked the build a stadium feature.
yEsw7UkWaa	Randy would have been told, this is what we're going to do...<br>  Don't forget, Rey could have also said no to the storyline, so it's not all Randy's fault.<br>  <br>  I don't think it was THE most inappropriate thing done by WWE. <br>  In my opinion the most inappropriate thing done by WWE was the Katie Vick storyline that HHH used against Kane (case of unrequited love, Vick dies in car accident, Kane was the driver, raped her and then kept her in a closet to "enjoy")<br>  And if alluding to the idea wasn't bad enough, HHH put on a Kane mask and acted it out with a mannequin.<br>  <br>  Needless to say BOTH story lines were VERY unpopular with fans and both were quickly killed. I think I recall Randy only saying the hell thing and one other thing about Eddie. Something to do with his biography and how Eddie himself said he was no angel. Randy was about to read a certain part to the fans when Rey came out and attacked him.<br>  The storyline quickly died after that.<br>  <br>  WWE often have moments of poor taste, but these two storylines were just over the line full stop.|`|lCzBONU1aa	This was the only thing I hated that they did:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ3T5dwOOo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJ3T5dwO...</a>|`|FEViNlQMaa	I remember that! and WWE is trying to cross the line so that people won't think he's soft and his acting will be more effective as the greatest future heel in the business|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I don't think it was the most inappropriate thing they have ever done.They have done a lot worse things!But never the less that was very inappropriate and very uncalled for and not to mention unnecessary.It really was a terrible thing for that to be written in the script.But really they have done a lot worse.<br>  <br>  BQ: I have no idea,but really if Vince says it is in the script it is basically done,like really do you think Rey or Randy were going to say no to the man who signs their pay checks?|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Thats so mean spirited of him. Why would he say that Eddie is in hell? What did HE ever do to him? That wasnt "the most inappropriate" thing, but it certainly has to be one of the top ones.<br>  <br>  BQ: No, that was completely uncalled for. That just broke my heart when he had to say that. But it was either booked, or it was not.<br>  Again, so mean spirited and uncalled for.|`|q06g4hHKaa	I rememeber watching that live...the first time I saw it I said to myself "Wow, did he really just say that?" <br>  <br>  <br>  Either way, Orton rules.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	The creative team told him to say it. Its not like he had a choice in the matter. You do what they want or you either get heat or released.|`|EzHyG66Uaa	How do you post links like you have on here? I remember that segment between the two. It was at the WWE Supershow in Orlando, FL.

Eddie isn't there.|`|gVCZlEPIaa	I rarely say this but that's pretty ****** up.<br>  R.I.P Eddie.|`|ZtZqtYA8aa	You do know WWE has no respect for eddie look at what vickies doing with edge that Sh!t just makes me sick|`|Gr7My8FTaa	He is stupid u shouldent talk bout the dead R.I.P eddie<br>  BQ: its the storyline|`|hApu3H5Jaa	The Katie Vick thing was kind of innapropriate.|`|PLyhhDFNaa	rko was told what to say by the creative team, what he said was a way of drawing in the audience into the feud|`|eXZ5O8vdaa	The "Creative" team must be on crack.

The Cowboys have not been the same since Jerry Jones ran Jimmy Johnson out of Dallas.  He has made a lot of questionable moves since taking over as GM of the team.    Not to talk garbage about the Cowboys, but Jerry Jones runs that team like he is building a fantasy football team.  He takes no account for character issues and the question of whether or not all of the pieces fit together and work cohesively.  In short, he is pretty much the new Al Davis.    Most teams try and run away from cancers and players with bad characters.  If they have them, they jettison them first chance they get.  Jerry Jones seem to want cancers like TO and Pacman Jones.  He figures that any publicity concerning his team whether it is good or bad is better than no publicity.   Jerry is the main reason why the Cowboys haven't won a playoff game since 1996.|`|ftbIWNydaa	2013|`|xrCbyfu5aa	if they get there sh*t together i'll give em maybe 2 years

khU8m4gxaa	In pro wrestling, a shoot is when something is legit as opposed to fake. If they start to actually fight instead of choreographing a fake fight, or if they call each other by their real name or say something that's true life instead of storyline. So, for example, a shoot fighter would be a UFC guy.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Shoot-Style is a martial arts type wrestling style from Japan.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	It could mean that the wrestler is a real fighter, if called a shoot fighter.|`|3m9DQuDRaa	There are three meanings for the term "shoot"...  but the big definition is "REAL" or the opposite of "Kayfabe" (What wrestlers call their scripted life.)    Now we'll go into the technical aspects of the term.    First, the term "shoot fighter" which is what you mentioned.  A shoot fighter is someone who doesn't plan out spots before a match.  Usually a match is a series of spots connected by wrestling basics, to make a story.  A shoot fighter makes up his spots as he goes along, telling a horrid story, AND confusing his match partner.  It's not ALWAYS bad (as in the case of Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, or Chris Jericho), but most of the time it's considered a hindrance to a good match.  Often a shoot fighter will end up injuring his opponent or himself for the sake of a "good spot."  In short, a shoot fighter is someone who doesn't script out his matches.    Next on the list is a "shoot promo."  This is when someone takes out his aggressions in his promo time, leading to non-scripted taunts directed, usually, at people not in his storyline.  Another version of this is someone who goes without a script to just "cut a promo" on his opponent.  The most famous case of "shoot promo gone wrong" is Scott Steiner when he started cursing on national TV causing WCW and Ted Turner MILLIONS in fines.  Again, it's not always bad (as in the case of Mick Foley, Paul Heyman, Steve Corino, and CM Punk), but it tends to either run long, or get confusing to the audience if it's not on topic.    The last form of "shooting" is the "shoot interview."  This is when a wrestler does an interview out of character.  This is usually considered taboo (Kurt Angle recently was fined for doing one in the UK while in his tenure in TNA), as it can either give away stories, or cause bad blood between a wrestler and his promotion if what he says is bad.  Mostly, shoot interviews are conducted by wrestlers who have left the big industry and have come back to the indies...  so they can tell the stories of the "big time" and still keep their popularity and respect.    -----------    There's also what is called the "scripted shoot" or "worked shoot."  This is when a promo or match LOOKS like a shoot...  like when Joey Styles "quit" the WWE and took out his frustrations with the company on live television...  or when Mike Adamle just stood up and left his post at the ECW announce table...  or the first time ECW invaded the WWE back in '98.    These are used to blur the lines between reality and kayfabe, because you end up questioning why the federation would badmouth themselves on national television...  but in the end, that's what they wanted...  cheap heat.  A pariah of this technique was Paul Heyman, with ECW AND when he was in the WWE...  he would shoot on the WWE because his character allowed for it.  But it was always to show some underlying plan for the future of the company.    -------------    In the end, "shoot" means real.  Instead of following the script, it's real and uncensored.|`|EAZv468Xaa	It means they are not in character. They are talking in real life. In other words it's not scripted. There are some great wrestling shoot interviews on youtube. you should check them out.|`|T73Y6BnWaa	In wrestling (not wwe or TNA or something like that) this is what shooting is. It is when you go in to do a move.    Look at 0:31 that is a "shoot"

zge3ShFEaa	Semi automatic is when you pull the trigger and it shoots once. Auto is when you hold down the trigger and it shoots consistently. your gun has a sensitive trigger (like most automatics) so you can easily shoot fast on semi, this is for tournament players or people who want more of a challenge or if auto is illegal.<br>  <br>  The spyder vs2 is Absolutely an auto gun. it shoots really fast and you don't need to put in much any effort to make it do so. it is also semi auto.<br>  <br>  I am not sure on specifically the spyder compact 2000. but in general, spyder makes really cheap guns that shoot really fast. they add performance and take away reliability. Smart parts is sorta the opposite.<br>  <br>  And in order to shoot anywhere above 5 balls per second. you will need to buy an electronic hopper. and for your automatic gun, you will need a nitro tank. co2 ruins it. <br>  <br>  Any way, don't feel stupid because we all used to be just like where your at. I haven't found anything to do that's more fun than paintball.|`|XYEhaQ5taa	Spyder's are the absolute worst gun apart from wal-mart, If you want something good you should check out brands such as; Shocker, Ego, Proto Matrix, ect.  Search them on eBay.  Also semi-auto is single ball shooting while automatic is it shoots constantly.  Many paintball fields don't allow automatic shooting, but with a nicer brand of gun you can use features call "ramping".|`|RX5t6x6Haa	KRUX14 - =======>Spyder's are the absolute worst gun apart from wal-mart, If you want something good you should check out brands such as; Shocker, Ego, Proto Matrix, ect.

Many paintball fields don't allow automatic shooting, but with a nicer brand of gun you can use features call "ramping".<===== <br>  dude spyders are the worst guns out there? yeah ok thats why there are spyder tourneys, because they are "worst guns out there" right?.... did you ever think that this kid doesnt have over $400 to spend on a damn marker, almost every gun you've mentioned are high-end markers<br>  <br>  shocker- $500<br>  Ego- $800<br>  Proto Matrix- $400<br>  any gun thats over eighter 400 or 500 dollars is considerd a high-end marker, yeah look on e-bay, yeah you can get them cheaper there but your also taking that chance that the marker was abused before hand, i spent 600 on an EGO, it came and it looked like the previous owner had shot marbles out of it, the breach was so damn scrached up, and within 2 weeks of getting it, i had over 400 dollars into it in repairs, and RAMPING ISNT AUTO, its just that RAMPING, in ramping you have to pull the trigger a certian amout of pulls in certian seconds, and as soon as your done pulling the trigger, within 1/2 a second the ramping is also done.<br>  <br>  BUT BACK TO THE QUESTION- The VS2 is an automatic and an semi, THE best marker out there for the price, i would highly suggest you use Nitro/N2/compressed air/HPA (all the same thing just different names), i've never heard of the compact 200, so i know nothing about it
sHzPnGXHaa	San Jose Sharks|`|VC5mEULTaa	Buffalo, because they have the best forward in the NHL (VANEK)<br>  the best D man (SPACEK)<br>  and the best goalie (MILLER)<br>  <br>  they can't be beat.|`|y531A4FAaa	Sharks..they're not too bad.<br>  <br>  and although i'm a huge Sabres fan, I have to disagree with Jay K because the Sabres aren't doing too hot this season and Vanek is out for the rest of the season with a broken jaw. Miller's good, but the way the team is playing now, he's practically the whole team himself because the defense stinks. ex. look how they played last night!|`|M1aXFtuUaa	Detroit Red Wings.<br>  <br>  Marian Hossa.Henrik Zetterberg.Pavel Datsyuk.Nick Lidstrom.|`|Tp6aH4hfaa	the wild because they are in pretty good condition to make the playoffs|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Go Wings GO!|`|yTb3AlOvaa	I would have to say the Boston Bruins. Its fairly clear to me that the Boston Bruins and the San Jose Sharks will most likely face off for the stanley cup. The Boston Bruins just have so many skilled players. Marc Savard is an amazing passer who trys to set up his teammates before taking a shot on net. Zdeno Chara has an incredible slapshot, and who could forget Wideman, Bergeron, etc.And of course, Tim Thomas, who, when hes on his game, can make mouth dropping saves. <br>  <br>  I think that Boston really plays defensively, and we all know that defense helps to make a team. To many teams in the nhl try and get superstar forwards, but the truth is, you need to work your way from the end at the goalie, through the defence, and to the front.|`|etErp8rcaa	Bruins. For the simple reason that everything's clicking right now. The entire team is pulling together, their chemistry is unbelievable, and they have no real key injuries. Thomas has been amazing for them in net all year, Fernandez has been a more than capable backup, their younger guys like Wheeler, Lucic, and Krejci. Kessel hasn't been great lately, but he seems to be turning into the player he was touted as.<br>  <br>  Basically, it's a bit of an "everything going right" situation at the moment. If they can keep that going, I don't think any team in the East is going to be able to compete, as each of them have some inconsistency or weakness that the Bruins this year don't seem to possess.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I think their biggest challenge would be in the Finals, but I still think they have the capacity to beat any team in the West. The Sharks would be their toughest opponent; for all Detroit's skill, Ozzie seems to have flaked out on them this year, and Conks is frankly not the guy.|`|TBUzQPXmaa	NO NO! NOT THE RED WINGS! I TOTTTTALLY HATE THEM!<br>  <br>  I'm still recovering from the horrible penguin loss yesterday.<br>  <br>  DAMNNN YOUUUUUU CAPITALS!!!!!<br>  <br>  I think either the Bruins or the Sharks will win the '09 cup.<br>  <br>  Unless GOD can answer my prayers for the Penguins x(|`|WX4kxxr8aa	I would have to say the wings,when the only change in your roster from the cup winning team is loosing hasek and drake and gaining hossa you got to have a good chance to repeat.|`|jBXutMblaa	Boston's got a good chance to win it especially with Tim Thomas in the goal.<br>  <br>  But I still stay Caps FTW!<br>  C-A-P-S CAPS CAPS CAPS!|`|BrWVhd9naa	If it was the bruins and sharks in the finals definetely the sharks uh how many times do i have to say this THEY OWNED THE BRUINS 5-2<br>  NOT EVEN AT HOME ICE|`|D6M975deaa	You're all stupid it's the new jersey devils.

tzrLDbHWaa	I know everyone is saying Stafford should be the #1 overall pick, and seems like everyone is on his jock or something, but in all honesty, if the Lions want to succeed next year, Matt Stafford is NOT their choice.<br>  <br>  First of all, how many great QBs of the past can you really think of that left college early to play in the NFL?  Most of the really successful QBs play all 4 years.  Most of the draft day busts, Ryan Leaf, Heath Shuler, Tommy Maddox, Tim Couch, Andre Ware, Todd Marinovich, etc. all left early thinking they were NFL material and all they really got was a big signing bonus, but never succeeded in the NFL.  Both Stafford and Sanchez are leaving early, and neither is really ready to play in the NFL.  <br>  <br>  In the end, the Lions will likely take Stafford and he'll probably fail like all the underclassmen before him have, but lets be realistic here, this is a franchise that we all expect to fail, and when it comes to needing a QB, sometimes its just too tempting to pass up.|`|CL7OTeiCaa	That would be a great combo, but I would go either Stafford and an Offensive lineman or and offiensive lineman and Josh Freeman or Mark Sanhez or Moreno.|`|M1aXFtuUaa	Im a Lions fan too and I would like to see them take OTs with both picks.  They just names Culpepper the starter?  I also heard Sanchez is starting to wow some scouts.|`|gF6pgy8raa	I would take Stafford 1st overall. Build around him and then take an OT with their 2nd 1st round pick.|`|tPaRZod9aa	Stafford and any ol they can get.|`|nfLd3ngraa	Stafford 1st overall. Even though people are saying lineman. However i don't won't a lineman because some of the top lineman don't have pro work ethic and have poor character. Matthew stafford is nfl ready. And he has a great arm so he could throw to calvin all day. As far a Mareno i don't want him because we already have a great back in kevin smith. Besides we have higher needs then a running back. Instead we i am sure one of those lineman will fall to the 20th pick. There are five lineman worth considering number 1 overall! If none of these guys are available we can go after a linebacker, or wide reciever Percy Harvin to back up calvin.|`|7RziqsDcaa	I hope to God that the Lions take Stafford/Sanchez.<br>  <br>  Then I get to watch them get sacked by the Bears D for two games next season!

r5AMG8g7aa	As already stated you need a sword cleaning kit (If it is a real sword instead of a wall hanger). What ever you do never use WD-40. some nit-wits think that is good for a sword. It actually is corrosive to the good blade and should ever be used. You should also never touch the blade as skin oil is also bad for the blade. Cleaning kits can be bough at many martial arts supplies stores, as well as any place that sells good katana.<br>  <br>  COMMENT : someone made a goofy comment about using an enemies blood. Well blood is also very corrosive to a sword. not only that it is why the samurai were careful to do a blood-shake (Chiburi) before re sheathing their katana. If blood was left on the blade it could not only rust the blade, it would congeal and glue the sword in the saya making it difficult or impossible to draw.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	You need a teire see Fred Lohman's web site - <br>  <a href="http://www.japanese-swords.com/pages/handling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.japanese-swords.com/pages/han...</a>|`|NvwVmiaZaa	clean it with THE BLOOD OF YOUR ENEMIES!!!!!|`|szcA8CDyaa	Clean it with something soft and thick.|`|c73AAq22aa	windex|`|oTb67zNYaa	that would depend if it is a stainless steel sword use windex if it is of a higher quality then you need to read this it has tips to clean and maintain our sword note not all of these tips are for Katana but it wiill say|`|YDpT2ClBaa	most martial art supply stores sell them<br>  or you can get them online<br>  www.awma.com<br>  <br>  never touch the blade, you do not want the oils of your hand to get on it.<br>  clove oil is a good substitute<br>  <br>  instructions<br>  <a href="http://www.japaneseswords4samurai.com/care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.japaneseswords4samurai.com/ca...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvICZWGcWfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvICZWGcW...</a>
0Dm3WEMcaa	They don't want the top stars to look weak by losing each week on raw or smackdown so the best way to end a main event without a winner is a DQ finish which has something to with the story they are doing. It's lame i know but i think that is the reasoning. At a PPV a win or lose situation is much easier to get away with because they have been building to it and you finally see who is the better man and all that crap.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	yh i know <br>  <br>  undertaker vs kozlov<br>  bigshow<br>  <br>  chavo vs taker<br>  bigshow<br>  <br>  edge vs cena <br>  jerico<br>  <br>  edge vs jeff<br>  matt<br>  <br>  and moreee..........|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Yea, I make pretty detailed observations.<br>  Yes, it does happen in PPV's.

oJsrGmmPaa	Depends on what team it is. If it's a team that constantly fails year in and year out like the Islanders and Thrashers, maybe.|`|76nTvO4iaa	no|`|yIdwMPsoaa	nope, no deal|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I would think that most people/teams would make this trade considering that if you offer an RFA a contract (somewhere about 6M+) and his previous club does not match then they would recieve 5 1st round picks as compensation.......so, take the case of Tomas Vanek two years ago, the Oilers offered him a HUGE contract but Buffalo matched rather than recieve FIVE 1st round picks......so considering Buffalo opted to not take those picks, I would have to think that three first round picks seems lowball.<br>  <br>   Also, the team trading the picks must be considered.........big difference between three #1 overall picks and three #30 picks...three #1's and I would think it would be a deal that favours the Caps (Tavares, Hall and some other highly ranked player ALL on cheap contracts).<br>  <br>   Also, with a salary cap in place nowadays, it also makes this deal less cut and dry......it would clear 10 Million in cap space....so the Caps could get three 1st rounders (assuming a bad team) AND have that $ to sign a couple of high profile FA's in the summer.<br>  <br>  <br>    Also, you have to factor in the marketing aspect, Ovechkin puts butts in the seats so that helps pay some of that salary.<br>  <br>   Would I? Maybe. Depends.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Not sure that many teams can handle a $9mm cap hit for the next 12 seasons.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	I'm not sure, that's pretty tough. I probably wouldn't.|`|UoUaO52taa	I would give up 3 first rounders for Ovie in a heartbeat|`|lYnkvRASaa	I keep ovechkin.<br>  <br>  Even if it is a weak team and you think three high first rounders, you have to remember that Ovechkin is going to make that team better.<br>  <br>  Assume Islanders win the lottery and get 1St overall pick this year.  They trade that pick and the next 2 yrs 1st rounder for Ovechkin.  Ovechkin will help them out of last place and the next to picks won't be near #1 overall|`|KyCJOR2paa	Not right now.  Maybe when he is 38 years old.<br>  <br>  Why would you give up the BEST goal scorer possibly ever for three what ifs??  Draft picks are never guarantees.  Would you trade Ovechkin for Steven Stamkos, Brian Lawton, and Alexandre Daigle?  Don't think so, that is what probably would happen.|`|Ym3FbmVOaa	No. God knows what these guy will be like, whereas Ovie has proven himself already and he's insane. Pavel Datsyuk was picked 171st overall, I bet so many people are hitting the wall with their heads now, just look at him.|`|D0f7uDtQaa	it would all depend on the year and what overall.  Mabye this year for tavares, hedmen, and duchne, but still probably not|`|j17vl3Nwaa	I don't think three first round picks is enough for a young player like ovechkin but it depends if the Caps are looking far in the future.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	No, probably not. But it depends on what situation you're in as well.|`|Hki3AoL5aa	you lost me at trade ovechkin|`|qXf9zfJ4aa	good question but no. think of the $$ you would have to end up paying 3 first round draft picks. and second ovechkin is already proven that hes one of if not the best player today. there have been hundreds of 1st round draft picks that have never panned out or become injury prone or really just not that good as they thought. NHL is a whole different level then the OHL or college or any other league for that matter. so i would turn down the 3 draft picks. but hey thats just me|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	Trade a bird in the hand for 3 in the bush that will most likely never be anywhere near as good as him? That'd be stupid. first round picks don't always pan out, ask Brian Lawton, Alexandre Daigle, Bryan Fogarty etc. With Ovechkin, you know what you've got and they'd be insane to let him walk for any price right now.|`|jBXutMblaa	The Russian Machine? No. He's too good.  The Caps wouldn't trade him especially if they signed him to a 13 year $124 million contract last Jan.<br>  I would trade Cindy for three though.|`|4crJhN62aa	Never trade him for 3 round picks that will mostly never be as good  as him.In my opinion he is the best player in the NHL, he is superhuman .|`|hz8YjsJPaa	What are you nuts  NEVERRR un less maybbee it was a stamkos,tavares,and a another amazing player|`|BrWVhd9naa	No are you mad he is much better than three picks|`|ROWSzTknaa	No. Are you mental?
AA12393503	I don't think hes overrated at all, i think hes a great point guard. He doesn't get many turnovers and can put up 10 assists any game, but with players like Pierce, KG and Ray Ray..i think i could put up 10 assists lol. Hes good because he runs the offense well and can take it to the rack and cause the foul, Doc has told him to get more offensive minded but i guess he prefers dishing. Hes averaging 11.3 PPG on 50% shooting, 8.4 APG, 5 RPG, and 2 Stls what more can you get from a PG. Hes one of the best in the league in my opinion, here goes my top 5 PG's right now.<br>  <br>  1. Chris Paul<br>  2. Deron Williams<br>  3. Chauncey Billups<br>  4. Devin Harris<br>  5. Rajon Rondo|`|tA5DrAPpaa	Are you serious?<br>  <br>  Rondo is one the the most OVERRATED players in the NBA because of all the Celtics bandwagoners.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	Rondo is an Aliennnnnnn|`|yrBa2BNvaa	he cant even shoot|`|4VvJoFNaaa	though i can allow myself to say that he is a top five point guard in the league just because he cant shoot, but he is without a doubt under the radar. i mean yeah he got three stars on his team but he has to be able to keep all of them happy because they all have differnt personalitoye and he has to figure out hot to get all of them goin, so hes got one of the hardest jobs in basketball and he is a vry underrated defensive player and rebounder.|`|OnpLn838aa	haha no he is not, he is a good pg but not underated he is playing with 3 hall of fame players wich makes his job wayyyy easier all he has to do is make the right pass or an ally oop. he is no where close to being underated.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	He got Killed by Deron Williams last night!|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	He is a great point guard he s in the top 10 in the nba|`|5FypDafWaa	He is a good passer but needs to improve on his outside shot.

AA10223526	Palmer will probably bounce back and Denver is 22nd against the pass.

Ctq4IdGVaa	la marca migliore è NIKE|`|mt2FkX2naa	mi pare ovvio che la marca migliore sia NIKE, ma io recentemente ho comprato un paio di MIZUNO che per correre sono veramente comodissime, come le indossi ti viene spontaneo correre...le paghi poco e ne fai buon uso, che vuoi di più!!!!!|`|bBAAriY6aa	puoi farne di più di km alla domenica con delle scarpe americane marca AGT con missili sotto alle tomaie.|`|477f614d54cffb47d4bd893bfa62e982aa	La marca migliore per lavori di corsa veloce è l'Asics o la Mizuno.<br>  Per i lavori lunghi (10\12 km) ti consiglio le Nike Pegasus.

Non aver pregiudizi di marca...<br>  <br>  Il tutto dipende da COME corri: come metti i piedi a terra, come è inclinato il busto, ecc..<br>  <br>  Comprati una rivista del settore (runners, correre) e troverai le tabelline dedicate alle scarpe che ti aiuterranno a scegliera la migliore per te!<br>  <br>  Se vuoi sentire un secondo parere, chiedi a noi o cmq ad un rivenditore specializzato!|`|gsY8menEaa	Dipende soprattutto dal tipo di appoggio a terra che hai. Il miglior sistema è quello di analizzare la suola delle scarpe che hai utilizzato finora (ma devi averle usate parecchio) . Se hai un appoggio normale vedrai usura sul margine esterno e al centro del tallone e al centro dell'avampiede; se sei pronatore vedrai che al tallone è usurato soltanto il margine esterno e all'avampiede il margine interno; se sei supinatore (raro) l'usura sarà principalmente sul margine esterno del tallone e dell'avampiede. <br>  <br>  Per un appoggio normale sono buone le NikeAir Pegasus, le Nike Xcceleration (che costano pure poco), le Mizuno Wave Genesis o le Adidas Adistar Cushion.<br>  <br>  Per un pronatore ci sono le Adidas Nova Control, le NikeAir Direct o le Asics Gel GT-2120.|`|omJptnW4aa	per un podista la scarpa è fondamentale!!la scelta varia in base a molti fattori, come la velocità a cui corri, il peso, la distanza, il tuo appoggio.......Io personalmente mi trovo molto bene con le asics ds trainer, ma sono molto leggere quindi se sei un po in sovrappeso o corri piano non vanno bene!! ti consiglio di andare in un negozio specializzato dove ti sapranno consigliare!!
f8S2kasMaa	Just ask your coach if you can only pitch part of the game and put either ice or Bengay on it.   Trust me Bengay helps. =]|`|V668FpDtaa	well fluffy duffty my old science teacher was a pitch too and she broke her leg and did not know and it only hurt a little so I think you should sit this one out!!!|`|1g2tQsaSaa	Seeing as you're in some obvious pain, I wouldn't recommend pitching the game today, unless its the '07 World Series. Doing something while you're hurt will only further your injuries.  Tell the coach you're in some pain, and I'm sure he'll find you a replacement to pitch, and you should be able to go again in a day or two.  Next time make sure you warm yourself up by doing some jogging, stretching, and small toss with a friend.  Then throw a couple warm-up pitches before you start throwing your good stuff.|`|O6o7uItgaa	You're done i had this once and i couldnt pitch for 3 days!|`|fMGU1QKLaa	I wouldn't pitch if I was you and in pain. When you try pitching with a leg injury, all you will do is favor it, and you will end up hurting your arm or a shoulder or else. Dizzy Dean did that, pitched with a broken toe and it killed his arm.

AztjFFsZaa	No running that distance on ur first day shouldn't be a problem if u run at a calm pace. Remember CC Season doesn't begin for 3 moths and the whole point of summer training is to work on ur endurance not speed. Try to run at a 8-10 min mile pace the first week so that u can complete ur first week. Then increase ur mileage  and speed every week after that so that u can improve (remember don't over do it have patience first begin with a slow pace and then later on in the summer increase ur speed. that way u don't wear urself out before the season actually begins) if u have any more questions please feel free to email me. Hope this helps|`|XjZ5CkJqaa	It is going to be really hard I am in XC and I train everyday over the summer, and sometimes I am still not ready for it. It will take some work, but your going to just have to do it, the best you can. Start out slow, keep a steady pace for monday, thats the only way your probably going to make it. On Tuesday increase your speed a little bit, and keep doing it every day. I don't know what else to tell ya, it isn't going to be all that easy|`|f9eylMmRaa	it'll be tough to get back into it under certian time frame but you'll eb able to do it i started x-c as an 8th gradrer bty we didnt have a modified so i started off on vasrity so i've have  a long tiem to train and get ready our races are 3.1 miler or otherwise known as 5 k and i can do it in 28 min 43 sec. but you can do it  u just dont overdo it trying to get into shape to quickly|`|TNDFoUFLaa	yeah, you should do it. It might be really hard but thats xc. If you think it might be hard start out running slower and get faster as you go.

Good luck!|`|mwNjk7U5aa	yes you can its going to be hard and you are going to be sore! but you can do it ....i did it to i haven't ran in a long time and i ran 4 miles my first day then 5 the 3 and so on..you can do it =)|`|NCE3BL0Aaa	thats ok
UULgRsDSaa	wow i have never heard of any of those players|`|36u3Ml0kaa	7.5<br>  In my opinion you need one more good pitcher.|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Pretty good. I give it a 7.5/10. You might consider improving your outfield as the main thing it gives you are stolen bases and speed. Also, try trading for aces, they'll help a lot. Your infield is pretty stacked but there's space for improvement at SS.|`|B46t8gkLaa	you need another staff ace for sure.

2N6oTOLQaa	I think it was a good move by the M's, he brings a spark and he is a fan favorite in the area. They're already selling tickets and jerseys like crazy. <br>  <br>  On the field, I expect him to be a DH most of the time, with occasional appearances in the outfield, mostly in left. I think he'll be right around 25 HR, mid .200's for average, and 80-90 RBI's. I don't expect him to get many stolen bases and I'm sort of just expecting him to be an average over-the-hill player who can still hit okay, but his glory days of batting .300 with 40+ home runs are behind him. <br>  <br>  I think that whether or not this is his last year really depends how the year goes. If he has a good year and stays healthy, I wouldn't be surprised to see him play another season or two. If he doesn't break .250 and 25hr, or if he has any major injury, I expect it to be his last year. Either way, I think he'll finish his career in Seattle and as a Mariners fan, I hope he's wearing a Mariners hat when he's inducted into the Hall of Fame. I would love to see him stick around and work with the M's as a hitting coach or manager, but I haven't heard anything about him expressing interest in a coaching career, so that's not much more than wishful thinking right now.|`|W7BZcdynaa	100 GP .240 Avege 15 Hrs 60 RBIs.<br>  <br>  He fell way off once he got off the juice.|`|ZX1nU9Vzaa	HRs:  15-20<br>  AVG:  ~.250<br>  RBIs:  70-80<br>  <br>  That's if he can stay healthy and play all year.  I'd be shocked if he reached 25 HRs and/or 90 RBIs.|`|VQyTspNraa	He'll play in a total of 15 games before he ends his career due to injury.<br>  <br>  Avg:  .201<br>  HR:  0<br>  RBI:  1|`|sSOqEzqxaa	HE WILL HAVE 19 HOMERS AND 48 RBIS AND BAT .275|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	your numbers sound right but i hope his average will be a littler higher and a few more number around

And if the same were to be replayed even up to 5 times with breaks in bw the games there wouldn't be a big gap of supremacy.

Uyz6iZwKaa	He will go fine but he won't be training as much (9-5 job and then training at night) and he will be paid substantially less which probably means less initiative to play awesome but hopefully he will pull his head in and eventually return to nrl.|`|uKoAMJQvaa	First he must control his temper. second he must control his whinging.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	He wasnt sent down to the AHL. He is being shut down for a couple weeks to work on his game. That simply means he will spend time working with Jim Bedard to try and get his game back in order. Think of it as a mental rest if you will, if he can clear his head who knows...if not expect the Wings to shop for a goalie before the trade deadline (Toskala?)...hence the timing of shutting him down. Looking a lot like last year when Hasek couldnt find his game, the hope now is can Conklin provide enough game to keep the Wings in serious Cup contention? Howard right now isnt the answer, he is being outplayed in Grand Rapids by Dan Larrson but he is the right call up because he has been between the pipes in an NHL game and owns a solid game. <br>  <br>  As for his confidence....right now he has none so this move is meant to restore his confidence. Dont expect him to get sent to the AHL, time there wont help as much as fixing the technical and mental game he is currently lacking and the Wings wont send Bedard to GR with Conklin being backed up by Howard just in case they play Howard and he needs help with adjustments.|`|KyCJOR2paa	THE WINGS DON'T HAVE CAP SPACE FOR A FA GOALIE LIKE TOSKALA!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  If they sign a big name goalie, then you can forget about them signing Hudler, Hossa, or Franzen. Osgood makes pennies comparatively. The Wings just need a goalie to play consistently good. Not AMAZING every game, just good. Detroit hasn't had to heavily rely on goaltending since I have been watching them (1996). You look at many of the recent teams with success in the playoffs. Anaheim with Giguere, Calgary with Kiprusoff, Tampa Bay with Khabibulin, Edmonton with Roloson, New Jersey and Brodeur. All of these teams would not have had success without their goaltender. And guess what, the only team of these that consistently is a contender is New Jersey... because he is the best goalie ever. When you look at Detroit, each of their Cups could have been won with any other NHL goalie in the net. There strength has always been good puck moving defenseman and a lot of skill up front. Also the only year since 1996 where they didn't win the Cup and goaltending could be blamed would be 2006. Every other year I remember whoever was in goal was the best Wing, whether that was Osgood, Cujo, Manny or whoever.<br>  <br>  The Wings will not win because of goaltending, they will win because they have the best TEAM on the ice.|`|4go3lFooaa	He wasn't sent down.  He is taking 10 days to get it together.  It's supposed to be a proactive move on the team's part and Chris'.  They're wanting him to play like they know he can.  They're just trying to get his head back in it.  <br>  <br>  Just goes to show you can't believe everything you read.|`|Rsr8nngWaa	They're still the best team out there, and just need to smack him around to get him back to caring.|`|etErp8rcaa	Manny Legace to return to Motown?|`|a1f5adfa819999f0dfc90cf84449307caa	WTF?|`|hz8YjsJPaa	no he just took 10 days off to practice with a goalie coach|`|zphPRFrTaa	idk|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	My thoughts. Well, first off, where the hell is Nips. Last year we had many debates about Osggod with him saying he is better than Luongo and should be in the HOF........Oh, and he would like to point out how Osgood NEVER had a losing season....well, Osgood is 18-5-7 this year. LOL<br>  <br>   Kill his confedence? I don't know.....what confidence really?<br>  <br>   Panic move? Yes, kind of. I think they are desperate to see if they should make a trade at the deadline if he is useless.<br>  <br>   BTW, noiw that I mention it.....where is that Nips guy?|`|DvBPLP4saa	(All the Detroit fans are going to start attacking me, but I don't really care anymore. It's not like they've never insulted a player from my team with the name of Sidney Crosby) I've never really thought of Osgood as a great goalie.........Maybe I'm just crazy though (Yeah I know me being crazy is the correct answer).....Though he has some Rings he's always had a great team in front to help.  I've never seriously called anybody overrated but if I were Osgood might be one.  Sure he's won 2 Jenning's trophies, but look at who he shared 'em with!!!! Vernon and Hasek!!!!<br>  (Osgood does play good in the playoffs, though, I'll give him that)<br>  <br>  <br>  Conklin has been the better goalie this year. Osgood has...well...for a lack of a better term...sucked this year. He may still have okay numbers (he always normally does) but he just has looked....bad. <br>  <br>  Panic Move? No. Maybe going down to the minors will allow Ozzie to clear his head. It's not like its going to hurt the Red Wings.<br>  <br>  If it does kill his confidence then thats his issue. If hes so full of himself he can't suck it up and face the fact that he was sent to the minors then what a baby he is. <br>  <br>  (I'm sorry if I sounded rude about Osgood or the Red Wings or anything in general. I'm not trying to sound rude. But everything I've said for the past week sounds rude...I don't know)|`|lYnkvRASaa	Not surprised with the way he has been playing, I think the end is near for Osgood.<br>  <br>  Interested to see if Howard gets any starts, he has been the goalie of the future for years now yet never gets a shot.  This might be a good time to see what Howard has at this level.  If he is not the long term solution the Wings are going to need a goalie next year.  As good as he has played Conklin is a career backup. If Osgood is done which I expect will happen soon, they could have to buy out that contract.  If they have to go find a FA goalie we can end the "can the wings keep both Hossa and Franzen?" discussions.<br>  <br>  Not a panic move but a move by a team comfortable in the playoff race to see if Howard can do it at this level.  If he is just there to back up Conklin and doesn't get to play then it doesn't make much sense to me.  Osgood has played enough in the NHL this year that at his age 2 weeks in the minors well not help him find his game.<br>  <br>  Not sure if there is much confidence left to kill.|`|UoUaO52taa	He wasnt sent down, just "home" to think, collect and regroup. Intresting move. Conklin appears to have the starting job for playoffs and this Jimmy Howard kid looks like a legit goalie from what I've seen. It could destroy Osgood's confidence but it can't be too much worse and I don't see that w/his experience. The positives seem to outweigh the negatives|`|yHvh7tFlaa	It could be the stat that said Osgood had exactly one more game allowing less than three goals as Conklin had shutouts that motivated the Wings.  It gives him a chance to get back whatever he has lost without the everyday pressure to win.  That Detroit is giving up 4 shots per game more than last season still doesn't add up to Ozzie's performance. I hope he comes back in a better mindset.  The Wings will need him right for the playoffs.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	I'm happy with it. This is make or break for his season. If he comes back and flops... goodbye. If he does good... then welcome back.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate: Don't worry... I am one Wings fan that wont attack you. I whole heartily agree with everything you said.
NQkRzBtJaa	Wrestle Mania 17 because it had a variety of types of matches. Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle was an awesome technical match. Raven vs Kane vs Big Show was a crazy hardcore match. Shane vs Vince father vs son was another great match. It had legends compete in the legends battle royal, it had the famous TLC match with Edge and Christian, The Dudleys and The Hardys and of course the main event the best rivalry of all time in the wwe The Rock vs Stone Cold.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	It's hard to choose, but I really loved Mania 20. It was in my hometown. ALL of the matches and storylines that night were perfect. I enjoyed every single one of them. That was one (of the two times) Kane wrestled Taker...Taker's return. I got goosebumps thinking about it! Jericho vs Christian. Eddie vs Kurt. Benoit winning...the end of the night with Eddie and Benoit.

8zgFyfibaa	@ james onyewu sucks if you clearly knew he was in the EPL with newcastle united he sucked there he was part of the 11 worst players in the EPL. The belgium league isn't at the same level as the mexican league.<br>  <br>  @ bobby wow the usa beats mexico and all of a sudden they are better hahaha you make me laugh. Plus your mexican wannabe american.<br>  <br>  Americans don't care for soccer because since they dint invent it they don't want to play it. That's how cocky americans are, but some mls fans still think the mls is better than the FMF. Its because mexican teams have participated in <br>  <br>  World club cup<br>  Copa libertadores<br>  Concacaf champions league<br>  Copa sudamerica<br>  <br>  Mls teams have only participated in only two international tournaments. (Copa sudamerica,concacaf CL,) <br>  <br>  Watch mls lovers and americans try to defend they're inferior league.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: kevin if pele who came to america couldn't get americans to love soccer who is????? Even the american media talks down on soccer jim rome espn commentator always talk shet.since americans are easely brainwashed they will listen to a stupid american commentator like jim rome to dislike soccer.<br>  <br>  Wow beasley made it to the semi finals but did he win a champions league????? There has been more mexican players playing in the champions league.<br>  <br>  Carlos salcido-psv eindhoven<br>  <br>  Ricardo osorio,pavel pardo-stuttgart<br>  <br>  Rafa marquez-barcelona (also he is the first mexican to win a champions league has anyone from the usa won a CL??????)<br>  <br>  Carlos vela-arsenal<br>  <br>  Giovanni dos santos-when he played for barcelona he played in the CL<br>  <br>  Nery castillo-again,when he played in olympiakos he participated in the CL.<br>  <br>  Like I said mls lovers will never accept they're league is a retirement league for old soccer players. But even they know its a mistake one clear example is david beckham he wants to stay in milan because he knows he'll never get called up in the english NT if he was to play back in the crappy mls.|`|dPnEKDZsaa	Well, Oguchi Onyewu won his league in Belgium while starting every game at Center back...so that one is blown up.  <br>  <br>  And Soccer is sport number 6 or 7 in America, and we still one of the top 30 teams in the world.  Is that saying too much?  Maybe not, but you can look at the sports we decide to care about and then look at our worldwide rank and see that it wouldn't take much initiative on our part to dominate in soccer as well.|`|9Izy4meLaa	In the last 6 months Mexico has been beaten by Chile, Jamaica, Honduras, and Sweden, not to mention the USA, and tied by Canada.......so, please....when you live in a glass house, don't throw stones.|`|33YAhRXFaa	i guess we can let mexico have one sport but now they dont even have that!<br>  <br>  USA OWNS MEXICO IN SOCCER AND EVERY OTHER SPORT ON EARTH.|`|LLnNjH94aa	We don't like soccer.  Because of that we don't care how good or bad our soccer teams are.  I didn't know we had one until about two years ago.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	Americans don't take soccer seriously. America thinks their leagues and teams are the best in the world and don't want their public to know that they aren't the best at soccer. However, Landon Donovan, who's on loan for Bayern Munich, has a chance, but it's not great.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Because all of our best athletes play either basketball, American Football, Baseball or Hockey.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately not many here in the States care for soccer. I do, but I'm in the minority.|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	hello diablito<br>  be careful before u become TC for the french section.<br>  diablito u say defend? so what are we suppose to do then? let u guys talk?<br>  <br>  for starters<br>  u cant compare mls with the fmf or US players with mexican players. (becuase that is not ur question, u asked if they won anything and gooch did. that answered ur ques)<br>  so u cant say the belgium league league or mls is inferior to the fmf.<br>  <br>  now i can say ussoccer is young and the mls which is true in some way considering soccer has now been taken seriously as compared to before. no one is sayin mls is the best. but u cant deny their rapid growth from their last 15 years. <br>  is true our athletes are sometimes overhyped but thats the medias fault which gives that perception to ussoccer and mls fans. i really thought adu will be the next big thing but it is obvious that he is not.<br>  <br>  soccer is the most competitive sport and for the time where ussoccer is know taken seriously it is understandable that they havent won anything. but at the same time their are other great teams thats been around for even longer that hasnt won anything as well.<br>  <br>  fans should be happy with the progress.<br>  <br>  is funny how some ppl think that the US isnt getting better, the US still has a long ways more to go to continue to improve. im sure this team hasnt reached its peak. as compared to most teams they have. <br>  <br>  can u imagine when the league improves? how better ussoccer will get<br>  its a fact if ur league is good then ur national team will more than likely be as well

He did take the bros K under his wing last year and maybe they found new "friends" this year. That may be affecting Kovalev. This probably takes some pressure off the GM/coach in some respects.<br>  <br>  If its game fixing people will be pissed, otherwise people are more upset with on ice performance than anything else. If they had won 8 of the last ten this would not be a story that Hab fans even care about.<br>  <br>  The radio call in shows are having a field day though.''<br>  <br>  I agree with what the person who got the best answer has to say. The real scandal is on the ice, not off it. Sure they are bad distractions, but if the habs started winning and playing with HEART like they did last year, we would barely talk about this.<br>  <br>  And im a Habs fan, and I live in Montreal<br>  <br>  I hope that helped<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  And to the stupid, ignorant, retar_ded flyers fan. I AM IN NO WAY EXCUSING HAMRLIK & THE BROS K BEHAVIOUR, but lets not forget that the linesman was holding Richard so that he couldnt punch the other guy (bruins player) he was fighting with. He was held back so that the other guy had an open shot. And the whole incident was started when Richard took a 2-handed slash to the head, drawing blood. Its sad really how you really have nothing to say but blame the Montreal Canadiens, when this could EASILY happen to ANY team. Remember Rick Tocchet?!<br>  <br>  Now get your facts straight before posting non-sense. And the flyers are probably the dirtiest team in the NHL, remember when u idiots tried to justify downie's (who i used to like bcuz of his intensity with team canada jr.) jumping hit on a Sens player (cant remember who right now). He jumped/dove/tackled the guy and it was legal? Stupid homers...<br>  <br>  ImJustMe, the Habs are no better than anyone else? Perhaps I should give u a crash course on hockey 101. The Montreal Canadiens had the best record in the East last year and have the most stanley cups in history, with 24 of Lord Stanley's finest. Get your head out of your ***. And if you truly want to see some dirty play, look at the flyers (past and present). From Hextall (the i-speared-an-opponent-where-it-hurts idiot, right in the jock strap) to Boulerice (the i-cross-checked-an-opponent-in-the-throa... idiot). Since 1967 (the expansion) the flyers have missed the playoffs more often than the habs. There is no hocus pokus with facts! While reading your answer, i had the distinct impression that you thought the flyers won the cup every year for the last ten years. Keep dreaming dillusional fans<br>  <br>  Besides, I thought it was innocent until proven guilty...?<br>  <br>  And Kate, you can still brag about how clean our NHL is, because the Journal de Montreal (a reputable newspaper in MTL) has written that the SQ (Quebec Police Force) has confirmed that the Kostitsyn borthers as well as Hamrlik are NOT suspects in any criminal activity whatsoever. It appears that the mobster was a friend of the Bros K, and that he would help them out by finding an apartment for them when they came to Montreal, managed certain aspects of their finances, repaired Sergeis car when it got damaged. I think that the biggest disgrace would be if they found out their was illegal gambling going on. And that has already happened before, lets not forget our friend Rick Tocchet, who was a member of the flyers organization, as it turns out. I will keep you posted on the details of this unfortunate affair.|`|F934e4HQaa	Their stupid|`|LRvjfQyhaa	I agree 100% with Jerry Hattrick.<br>  <br>  As a Philadelphia sports fan, all I hear is that we're trash and our athletes are goons.  Well now here comes Montreal's perfect team that everyone thinks can do no wrong, and they're a complete embarassment right now.<br>  <br>  I have no problem admitting that I smiled a bit reading those articles and seeing those pictures.  Maybe now that organization and their fans will get off their high horse and realize they're no better than anyone else.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Yeah Loblaw did:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Al9Hw7biGgUfXRY9yAl6mHXty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220080744AAzNpYR&show=7#profile-info-XQoH9ZI5aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Lots of good answers in there|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	Hab-nots|`|AA11674745	To be honest, I'm actually delighted to see the Canadiens players being an embarassment to the team and it's fans. Only because of the population of Canadian (no misspelling) fans that continue to look down their noses at the Flyers and us fans, while conveniently forgetting the model behavior at the Montreal Forum oh so many years ago when after the Commissioner had the temerity to suspend Maurice Richard for doing a two-handed tomahawk chop to the head of another player.<br>  <br>  They rioted in the streets and later egged the commish at one game.<br>  <br>  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.<br>  <br>  Another thing too is that the tabloids are fanning the flames on this story and that isn't lost on me. That is to say that this kind of thing goes on more than is reported and somebody probably leaked this out because something happened to them that they got their feelings hurt over and now they are trying to get back at those involved.

Impossible.<br>  <br>  But, if that is true, I need to know why you hate cricket? There should be a reason behind it.<br>  1. If it is because of a newly found interest in some other sport (or something or anything), I would say 'cricket is the best thing on earth. It could raise your spirits, it could dampen; It could be exciting, it could be dull. Just like life with all its twists and turns. One that can endure, triumphs'.<br>  2. If it is because England's recent performances, I would say 'it's Okay, everything will have to undergo a chance. Wait till Ashes, England will raise the bar to unprecedented levels'.<br>  3. If it is due to some other reasons, 'Well, cricket is a  wonderful game. Enjoy it. Leave your worries and apprehensions behind'|`|kecdkv6jaa	Well after Englands recent performances (all out for 52 and couldn't get that final wicket the other day) i would say maybe!! lol<br>  No, if said that i would just say you are a terrible liar.<br>  <br>  Just come watch me bowl, that will restore your faith in cricket all together.

fvMv1DT3aa	I sure hope it isn't like last year. Every other question was about the draft and it got so annoying after awhile. I hate it when people try to predict what's going to happen. Why can't people just wait and see? It would make things a lot more exciting and suprising.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Wouldn't surprise me.I don't understand why people don't just scroll down and see if the questions been asked already?Seriously like when Jeff Hardy was hit by the fireworks every freaking question was Is Jeff hurt?Is Jeff Hardy really injured?Was that thing with Hardy's fireworks real?OMG Jeff Hardy!!!!!!!!? Or like before Survivor Series Is Edge returning? When is Edge coming back? Edge still injured? Or more recently Is Christian returning to the wwe?Christian really going back to the wwe? Christian returning or not? Like really people just look and see if it has been asked already.|`|qt7QcmtPaa	Cenas awesome.

But, as for that, I haven't seen any people talking about it but anyways it wiil be annoying like that Christian Cage rumor " z0mg li3k chr1i5thun w1l r3turn and b3t uP j3ff and li3k h3llp 3dg3" That was VERY annoying to me.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	LOL<br>  You are so right.<br>  Don't we all get tired of typing the same answers over and over?<br>  And why is it that people think Cena will go to SD?

Vp3Lxg4taa	Hard to say, but 18 ounces will not be as easy to sell.  19 and 20 seems to be what people are using where I play.  I have a 19.5.   I'd give you $100 IF it were 19 oz.  I think your best bet is to try selling it on Ebay, or go down to you local tournament and sell it there. I'd ask about $120, then let them bargain you down.  The stick retails over $200. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.poolndarts.com/p-5894-McDermott-Black-Widow-Spider-Cue/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poolndarts.com/p-5894-McDermo...</a>|`|B2eGb9ZEaa	The 1st answer sums it up. Another idea is Craigslist. I have sold some obscure items and had a ton of response there.|`|Fp40wHSraa	If I'm not mistaken your talking about the cue with the spider on the buttsleeve.  Good news is that it's a McDermott.  Bad news is that McDermotts with pictures (wildlife, airbrush type stuff) don't resell well.  You can usually catch McDermott's with graphic designs like the black widow on Ebay below $100 used.  Most of the time below $80.  You'd have better luck if it was just a plain black McDermott.  Try selling at a bar on pool league night or on Ebay.  Maybe a pawn shop, but they'll only offer about $60 (if that) on it probably.  Hope this helps.

ed377f9dc2958771e37512095f53f6bbaa	My experience:  If you have the orthotics, you have compensated for your over-pronation (flat-footedness).  You should then be able to wear "regular" (neutral or cushion) shoes confident that you won't get shin splints or that lovely clunk-clunk, Frankenstein feeling that we flat footed types have.  <br>  <br>  And you should.  "Flat-footed shoes" -- those designed for over-pronation, are several ounces heavier than other shoes because they have the supports built in.  Over a marathon, that's a lot of extra weight, and in a sprint that's a tenth of a second wasted carrying weight you don't need to. <br>  <br>  Upshot:  I haven't had shin splints in the 12 years that I bought orthotics.  <br>  <br>  But shoe people like RoadRunnerSports.com say you should wear the support shoes if you have orthotics - their Shoe Dog will point you to the heaviest shoes they have.  I don't buy it.

rv6zl5t3aa	Isles win this one IMO. They are cutting salary, McAmmond is probably there just to finish out the season and they get a #1 pick next year. Albeit it's from SJ who may finish first overall, but the Isles really need to draft well and start over....AGAIN.<br>  <br>  Campoli may be young, but apparently his body isn't, so getting rid of him just frees up a spot for another kid to take.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Sens for now I guess....kudos to them for not cashing in on the season and trying to make a run at the postseason (no matter how disillusioned they might be).<br>   Plus, like you said, it is SJ's pick so it isn't likely a blue chipper and it's a weak draft class. Still a little strange for a team to mortgage the future a little to try to improve when behind the eight ball but we can't fault them for trying.<br>   Who knows with the way the 5-10 seeds are playing.|`|DvBPLP4saa	Oh no. What shall Hillary Duff do now that her boyfriend was traded to Ottawa. *Gasp*!<br>  <br>  <br>  Q: Ottawa wins. Though, they've dug themselves a hole so big this year that not even God could help them.|`|AA11674745	I think the Islanders got the better of this deal. We had Comrie here in Philly and I think the Sens are looking for the same thing the Flyers were seeking - a break out, potential-fulfilling career year. I don't know much about Campoli but oft-injured players are usually a liability. In that sense, New York has helped themselves.<br>  <br>  I've always been impressed with Dean McAmmond's consistent play. The draft pick can go any sort of ways.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	That was the most pointless this season. In reality (and not in Melnyk's loopy frame of mind), there's no reason for this trade. The Sens are still mathmatically in the playoff hunt....but so are the Isles and Thrashers. Think about that. I read somewhere that the Sens are gearing up for a ninth place finish. Reminds me of the Leafs last year....<br>  <br>  But if I were to guess as to who came out on top in this trade, I'd have to go with the Islanders. A first round pick, even if it is from one of the top teams in the league, is always a good thing, and having two of them in your possession is a great way to rebuild.|`|UoUaO52taa	The fact they got a 1st rounder is enough for me. McAmmond means nothing though for NY<br>  <br>  They shoulda hung onto Campoli if they could've|`|4e5b4896d3758b051623a078b2e188f8aa	I think the Isles win quite easily, since it seems all they were trying to do was dump salary.  My guess is that McCammond is gone after this season, with his salary (or Comrie's old salary) coming off the books to be used elsewhere.  I know the first-rounder won't be an early pick, but they've still got a shot at adding someone decent while also getting depth, which is what they need.  At this point, they're better off stockpiling picks than they are in trying to get a difference-maker through free agency or a trade.<br>  <br>  The Senators do now have the power of both Carrie Underwood and Hilary Duff going for them, but I don't think it's enough.|`|GKOFenmcaa	Islanders get the better of the trade. That draft pick will either get them a nice young player on draft day or they could trade that and get a talented vet. to build the team around. Give it another season or two and the Islanders will be a tough contender in the NHL. They need to get rid of their GM...I'm saying that as a fan of Garth Snow.

qJMniOSgaa	Well........i would definately make sure you hang on to the wall!! Otherwise just do what i tell other begginners- step step glide, step step glide.<br>  <br>  And do exactly that. it helps if you just try walking, then eventually trying to glide a little. if you feel like youre leaning back, lean forward, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  just remember- if you fall, you hav an immeadiate ice pack ;D<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|2eW7U8FQaa	one tip is never stare at your feet while skating. You start to worry about where you're putting them. Also if there is a barrier just hang onto that until you get your balance and then when you feel like you are brave enough to let go of the wall then just remember that it is just like walking.|`|4VSiNDrXaa	i've been skating for over ten years but when i take my friends skating i tell them to not lean too far back or too far forward and keep your legs slightly bent. and make sure your skates are tied properly.

x9GODf8eaa	1. I expect they will do the same as usual, small improvements here and there. I have not been able to get any info from the guys over at bauer, but they told me April 10 is set to be the release date in Canada.<br>  <br>  2. I expect about the same as when the xxxx's came out; $750-800 max<br>  <br>  3. I would keep your xxxx's. They are still going for around 500-600, and that is more than you would get for them. You would be down 2 or 3 hundred if you sold them and bought the x60's. Its not worth it. Wait until you grow out of those, and by then the x60's will have gone down.
jA6OZjIGaa	Actually they might not even make it to the playoffs<br>  <br>  but if they do probably to the second round<br>  trust me, Curry might be a rookie coach, but he was an assistant coach of the pistons for like 5 years<br>  <br>  So I think he learned what they are supposed to do in playoffs from those years|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	i dont think they would make it..they're 27- 26.. and cant win at home..<br>  <br>  so theY want the road court advantage..its sad because i like the answer but he is the problem with DEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTROOOIT basketball|`|Ga11Abmzaa	As long as iverson is on Pistons they never will win another title.|`|I71ePk4Haa	Not very far...if they don't lose in the first round, they will lose for sure in the second round.|`|V48H3aWQaa	I don't see them getting out of the first round.

1uSoU8Lpaa	In theory a very good idea. There are a lot of guys who are good, but not at MLB caliber, or guys who just never made it out of the farm system, or even older guys who want to continue to play (not worry about the $$) but still have it in them to continue. If they could find a fan base, I think you could put together teams. This for the simple fact, that there are a lot of guys who just never made the minors. Or guys like I mentioned prior.<br>  <br>  I'd go, it would be fun, but I can see it being a big venture and chance. The money and fans would be the hurdle.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	The major problem you'd face is the same problem currently faced by the World Baseball Classis -- Getting you major talent to actually play in it.<br>  <br>  There are a number of "developmental" leagues league for younger players, and an team of major leaguers usually travels to Japan during the winter to play some exhibition games.  Latin players normally return home to compete in their county's off-season leagues.  Between all the commitments already out there, I don't think your offseason league will be much more than something like the Arizona Fall League.|`|lp4wajLxaa	As much as I love watching baseball I just don't think it's a good idea.  Teams up north that aren't in a dome would be at a huge disadvantage because they'd play all their games on the road.  Also baseball is already the longest season in sports at 162 games.  I don't know if you've ever played that many games, but I have and it really takes a toll on your body, these guys need an offseason to rest.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	As a baseball fan, I would be into it.  I think they have a winter league in the Caribbean so they should just broadcast those games or something!|`|5m9An5rTaa	I really Miss being able to watch baseball in the off season. I wish they would just broadcast some of the Mexican leagues or the Carribean league games.|`|c3tADklmaa	Caribbean World Series.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I don't think that will happen with all the Hispanic baseball games happenin.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I asked that question 25 years ago, and it still hasn't happened, maybe someday!!<br>  <br>  I'd like to see some of the Mets prospects hit in MSG.

pVbrHX0xaa	Good payer, brings a good atmosphere to the tournament, good strong cue action, he has an admiration for the game. And he is a good breakbuilder, the only thing that he might want to work on is his risk taking, as he is well know to take risks which could leave the opponent to take the frame.

ko9Zy9k7aa	7/10.<br>  <br>  Some good matches.<br>  Elimination chamber matches good as ever, except the Edge thing was annoying. The WWE favours him too much recently. And Triple H winning WWE title was kinda predictable.<br>   <br>  <br>  Xx|`|95uXmC94aa	It was alright. Disappointing having triple H win again. But the rest was fine. I like the whole edge thing going on since i'm a huge fan. So I guess edge boosted the rating for it. But the HHH thing sort of brought it down. I would say 7 or 8|`|1UKAho1iaa	Unfortunately, I missed it because I was out of town that weekend. I heard it was alright, though.

I think he's playing well all round the Park (JS).<br>  <br>  We always start really performing after Christmas & Sir is using his squad brilliantly. That might change if he doesn't sign Tevez.|`|7x4VtGtFaa	It really looks very exciting for Man Utd supporters. On pole for its 18th top league title (a record 11 premier league trophies) and doing it in style (setting a European record for clean sheets and possibly being the most prolific side once again in terms of goal scored).<br>  <br>  I am sure Liverpool fans enjoyed them topping the table. I am also sure Aston Villa supporters are very pleased with how high they can potentially finish (as high as 2nd). With Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton in the mix, they will be slugging it out for Champions League places.<br>  <br>  Perhaps we will see in this season again a member of the "big 4" out of the CL places (Liverpool). Ha ha!|`|svU3xeotaa	EPL teams will dominate CL forever... my predictions<br>  <br>  Man United will beat Inter<br>  <br>  Chelsea will beat Juventus<br>  <br>  Liverpool will beat Real Madrid<br>  <br>  But i think Roma will beat Arsenal.<br>  <br>  EPL 4 Ever.|`|XrT3gIRbaa	Cant imagine it can be that exciting if you support Luton!!!|`|WdOAxQmoaa	aye shut up!! lol|`|rfCGWFNcaa	ah bollox now wheres me shotgun!!,,lmao|`|uUitKmJMaa	Yeah we've got real madrid coming up, so exciting :)|`|p8lB73rdaa	UTD have already played Chelsea twice in the league .|`|GjpWEu6Raa	what about the game against villa....?|`|bqvOOUwDaa	From a Manchester United fan's point of view, yes it's very exciting.<br>  But i'm an Arsenal fan and i can honestly say i'm not as excited as i was at the beginning of the season tbh!|`|nGpBuI9Oaa	u have already played chelsea twice, check the fixtures man and inter are gonna beat yah 2-0 first leg, and dnoo about second.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	hull city are doing very well.<br>  <br>  rightly so.<br>  <br>  very exciting times for the tigers.|`|0HO8sTGeaa	ya... there certainly is... seeing man u playing like this... as usual they are good after christmas.... =8~D

xpiGWrdMaa	I live in a big city and everybody here rides all over the sidewalk. So that's where I ride.|`|LIpCGz4oaa	normally its the car that runs into the cyclist. give them some space. they do no harm. you do.you pollute the air with your car. you run over innocent cyclists. you think you own the world because you pay road tax. get real.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	Cyclists pay their share of road tax, because most of them also own cars and pay taxes the same as you. Roads are public utilities open to the public. That means everybody, not just motorists. Everybody has means of identification, a drivers license is not the only way people can identify themselves. The road is owned by everybody, if you are not prepared to share it with other users, stay at home.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Actually the cyclists are ones getting ripped off.  We are paying the same tax on a vehicle as you are along with insurance, license fees and gasoline taxes.  Most cyclists own a car but we don't get a break on insurance and other fees when we ride a bike.  We do however put a much less burden on the environment, road wear, and health care system then someone that never gets exercise or rides a bike. <br>  <br>  It's just not fair.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	son, it is apparent you have some growing up to do....it takes time so be patient. Sorry you feel this way now young driver gas WILL go back up to $4 a gallon soon enough.|`|CttL3LmBaa	Vodkaqueen, (?) did you know that pedestrians have the right of way in all circumstances on public roads?  They pay no road use tax, they don't need identification to walk, and they can stumble into your car and knock your rear view mirror off -- and you get sued if they hurt themselves in doing so.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you pick on everyone but yourself in this situation, not just bicyclists? <br>  <br>  You don't have a right to the road just because you are in a car.  Driving is a privilege not your right.  You have no more right to the road than a bicycle and vice versa.  Bicyclists are, in most cases, legally allowed to ride 2 abreast (so are motorcycles).  <br>  <br>  I checked with my insurance company and I am covered while I ride a bicycle by my home owners liability coverage.  There are NOOO uninsured car drivers.<br>  <br>  As you state your case it becomes more ignorant.  If a bicycle runs into your car (has it actually happened for pity sake?) the bicycle will sustain more damage than your car.  Ride off, yeah, right.<br>  <br>  You come to our category and ask if we love or hate them.  We ARE cyclists.  Now what do you think...|`|83TPsWimaa	I can't help but notice that your description of cyclists is actually alot like pedestrians.  They don't pay a road tax, nor do they buy walking insurance.  They are not forced to carry a plate to id themselves, and if they walk into your car, they can just walk away.  What a crime!<br>  Cyclists don't get more rights, just the same rights as you.<br>  You pay road tax because you pay for the damage your vehicle does to the road.  General wear and tear.  Bikes cause very little damage, so any tax would have to be negligible.  And for the record, you support increasing taxes.  Because you pay a tax, everyone should pay a tax for something you feel is similar.  Insurance is meant to cover the damage you cause in an accident.  Frankly, I wouldn't damage your car too bad if I ran into it, but would be more than willing to cover it.  And my house insurance covers my bike...so...why insure it twice?  Also, you get to choose the level on insurance on your vehicle.  I can actually purchase additional insurance if I wish...but I choose not to.<br>  Seems fair to me.<br>  I guess the only question remaining is..why would you post this type of angry comment on a cyclist's area?|`|CA7lEkYIaa	this could be a very argumentative subject especially when you post your question on the bike section, we are people who love riding bikes and  discussing them with one another, you saying we should not be on the road where do you want us to be???? on the public path ways where theres kids playing ect ect get real may be if every one took to biking there would not be so many abese children & adults in the uk! just saying.|`|PkDOw7dBaa	Because they're not poisoning the air.<br>  Dont get me wrong, i'm not an environmentalist freak. I drive my SUV every day to and from work and wherever else i feel like going. I know i'm polluting the environment... But its just so damn convenient, ya know?|`|AA12342474	I've ridden bicycles for years and thousands of miles, I've commuted for years 30 miles each way 5-7 days a week, and I think I've seen most everything at this point. I have a license and own a car, so I see it from both sides.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to be condescending towards anyone or point fingers in one direction... Both sides are at fault to an extent... In most states a bicycle is legally a motor vehicle when it is one public roads and must obey traffic laws which they often don't, on the other hand motorists typically don't yield right-of-way to cyclists when they are supposed to. People, especially kids (kids are often innocently ignorant about this topic, adults are blatantly stupid), should have to take a traffic safety class or something before they can legally ride on the road so then know better that to ride the wrong way into traffic and such. Motorist should be more educated while obtaining their license about bicycles and right-of-way. As far as the taxes, they are for road maintenance, I'm not sure if walking on a road or riding a bicycle on it wears it more but both are insignificant. Some areas do require the equivalent of plates, usually in the form of a hideous sticker that you are supposed to put on your frame (and if you ever take it off you often find it ruined the paint and when you are riding a $2000+ bike that gets pretty annoying). I don't mind cyclists anymore than farm tractors on the road (I live in a rural area) as long as they are riding according to the law. When a cyclists breaks the law or a motorist violates the their right-of-way the police should enforce the laws without bias. Just for the record, I've had police (that weren't on a run) blow stop signs through my right-of-way before (being an EMT myself I know that they aren't supposed to do that even if they are on a call).

CttL3LmBaa	Noises are hard to pinpoint sometimes.  Check obscure things like spokes rubbing at the cross on coated (colored) spokes.  Look for hairline cracks on your rear hub flanges where the spoke holes are.  I had a rear hub fail at the flange on the drive side and it gave me plenty of clicking noise warning.  No mechanic could find the noise, because I didn't hear it as coming from the back wheel.  It actually sounded like it was coming from the crank on every revolution.  Are the crank bearings good, lubricate, and free of dirt?  Did they check the chain for a stiff link that pops as it goes around the gears?  Did they check for chain stretch? Try to have someone ride with you and see if they hear where it is coming from.  Sometimes if they hear it they can see what is making the noise.<br>  Like I stated, noised are hard to pinpoint and you are going to have to really search to diagnose the problem.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	without being able to actually hear the noise for myself and then give you a diagnosis I or anyone else cannot really give you an idea as to what is wrong (if anything) how about this: go out and ride your bike like there is no tomorrow and when it finally is broken and unrideable then take it back to the bike shop....until then don't worry about it! btw, what is a "slack" gear??? and it is almost always something simple too...|`|ovHZec7laa	Take off the pedals, put abit of grease/ lubricant on the threads and put them back on. I had an annoying click that i just couldn't pinpoint, i thought it  was my new bike shoes so i fiddled with the cleats, changed them twice, took of the back wheel, fiddled with the gears etc and all the time it was just one pedal needing adjusting. Good luck.|`|cSxTtqr6aa	perhaps you've chipped the clog things in the back which the chain runs over? check it :)
SEpHGcnKaa	World Record is 10' I believe and weighed 302 pounds. Biggest ones are in Texas of course! Everything's bigger in Texas!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	5-6 feet is not unusual.<br>  <br>  Here is one that is over 8'<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/hunting/alligatorgar.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/photos/hunting/all...</a>|`|uzNm9KtYaa	Alligator gar are one of the biggest of the big freshwater fish.  It frequently exceeds 100 pounds.  The largest known was 302 pound fish that measured over 10 feet long.  It can be found from northeastern Mexico and up the Mississippi River to somewhere above St. Louis, MO. and the Ohio River to about Louisville, Kentucky.  It feeds mostly on other fish, and lives in backwater bayous, lakes, and larger river systems.  It is fished for mostly for the sporting challenge rather than for the flesh or its roe which are thought to be toxic to humans.  Early Americans used the scales of the gar as arrowheads.<br>  <br>  (PLEASE NOTE:  Charles A. Purkett, Jr., former Chief of Fisheries for the Missouri Conservation Commission in Jefferson City, Missouri states in his discription of the Alligator Gar [Lepisosteus spatula] which can be found in McClane's New Standard Fishing Encyclopedia on page 20, "The roe of all gars is very toxic to humans if used as food."  I wouldn't ignore this warning.  It could be hazardous to your good health.)<br>  <br>  I can't and won't argue with experience.  I have never eaten gar roe.  But not long ago, I had one of my answers on another similar gar topic corrected by another "expert" who asked me to change my answer because gar were believed to be toxic, especially the roe.  I "modified" my answer to accomodate his suggestion but did not take a stand until I started my own research on that subject.  That is how I happened on the "quote" from the Fishing Encyclopedia where an expert and professional state agent whom I would think could be considered to know his business better than I do made the quotation I listed above.  I won't say anyone is right or wrong.  I leave that decision for the readers to decide.  Also, it should be pointed out that his quote doesn't include the flesh of the gar, but specifically mentions the roe.  I might point out that there are also different kinds of gar and he is regarding roe taken from the alligator gar in particular.  There might also be a chance that people who have traditionallly used the flesh or the roe can build up an immunity to the toxins and even pass it along to their offspring where-as someone exposed to it for the first time might have an adverse reaction.  (And for the record, I am a survivor kind of guy who will eat just about anything at any time including buffalo [the fish or the bovine].  I have taught survival skills to bush pilots who have asked me to show them how to continue to survive a crash once they live through the initial shock of actual crashing.  That includes eating a lot of different kinds of flora and fauna, sometimes without the benefit of cooking over a fire.  In that respect, I am willing to bet I have tasted and tested more varieties of wild game, both cooked and uncooked, than just about anybody in here.  I was born and raised in Iowa and the buffalo "fish" is quite common there.  We caught them best on crayfish tails.)<br>  <br>  Thanks for adding good and valuable feed-back to this interesting topic.  I sincerely appreciate the comparisons.|`|J3ymDwYgaa	I hate to disagree with a so called expert but I too like steve grew up in the arklatex area and have eaten probably a truckload of gar. its very good fish if prepared right. we caught some in the red river that would push real close to the 7 and half foot-mark, never really weighed them though. (as a side note i would bet the expert doesn't eat buffalo either)|`|SfDNRXNcaa	Here's the current records for rod and reel on big gar. <a href="http://www.landbigfish.com/staterecords/fishrecords.cfm?ID=67" rel="nofollow">http://www.landbigfish.com/staterecords/...</a>  Raised in Louisiana and Tx, we ate gar that we caught. If prepared correctly' it's pretty tasty, but they say us cajun's will eat anything.lol. You can fry the row and eat it as well, it is not a toxin, they were usually cooked the same day the gar was caught. I still head down south and fish for em every couple of years or so. Edit, Dan, if they are toxin then cooking them must take care of the toxins, otherwise half of my cajun friends back home would all be sick,lol.   40yr exp.
VgBeu3Vqaa	Ok but for paint balling, how far are you going to be, with the velocity regulations your gonna have to be within 50yrds in order to hit anything.<br>  so if your gonna be that close id go full BDU, and then over top id go Full Ghillie, because that way you can switch fast and if you outside in close range the ghillie will cover you up. <br>  Remember: "Camoing up is something you do in the field, Not in the store!"<br>  What this means is cover yourself with vegetation and your surroundings in order to completely blend in.<br>  And in indoor and fast paced games you can play with the BDU.<br>  Trust me on this. if you camo stategy is done right, it never fails and you will become invisible, I always wear BDU under my homemade ghillie suit for senarios just like this.<br>  Good luck in paintballing!|`|5qzndqYQaa	If your a sniper get a ghillie suit.I don't know what a BDU pants are but based onthe other answers get both.|`|QC2NozBkaa	The best camo in the world is motionlessness.

9Kt7p7Vfaa	Its much easier to land switch than start switch. You'll want to practice skiing backward so you are comfortable landing switch. I'd recommend not trying a 180 off of a jump first, but rather as you a skiing across the hill. Just pop up and turn around, ski backward a little and do it again. This will help you get the feel of landing backward when you take it to a jump.|`|yQYP7yFuaa	you should start going backward turning around early before the jump|`|WBzoocIhaa	starting normal and landing switch is easier,

711ff7c6324ba6361ad31a16ee95d14eaa	You have a unique perspective.  I think, for the casual fan, the steroid era boosted enthusiasm without a doubt.  I remember hearing women at work talk about the HR race in 98, and really get into it - even though they might not have been able to name 5 team names.  <br>  <br>  And, as fans, we need to quit being so naive, because anyone who knew anything about baseball knew what was going on, and it had nothing to do with juiced balls, smaller ball parks, or expansion.  Prior to the mid 90's, I never saw a middle infielder that could get confused with an NFL Linebacker (maybe I am exaggerating a bit).  But all of the sudden, everyone was huge, hitting for power, and the ball parks were all selling out.  So, all of those butts in the seats either belonged to idiots would couldn't read the writing on the wall, or people who didn't care because 'roid ball was more exciting than the Whitey-ball from the 80s (not a racist comment - named for Whitey Herzog).<br>  <br>  Was it worth it - I have to say yes.  I don't only think it was worth it, but I think it saved the game altogether from an NHL style plummet to irrelevance.  I just think it's hypocritical for the fans to now say they feel cheated - in all reality, true fans knew all along, and the casual fan wouldn't have cared about the game without the juice.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I don't know if I think it was worth it.  I mean, I, for one, never liked McGwire at all and I've always hated Bonds, so I really didn't like seeing them breaking the records.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know about everyone else, but I'd rather see a well pitched 3-1 game with good all around play over a 13-12 slugfest.  I mean, lets say you're going to see a Blue Jays game, would you rather see their ace, Roy Halladay pitch in whats likely going to be a low scoring game, or would you rather see someone like Shawn Camp and his career 5+ ERA to a likely slugfest?  Personally, I'd rather see a well played game where the teams have to work for their runs rather than see a game where every other hit is a homer.|`|5m9An5rTaa	You are the first person that I have found that actually agreed with me. Im only 32 but have been a baseball fan all of my life. That era was some of the best if not the best ever. It also came at a time when baseball really needed the help.

2s244jGgaa	Easily Gary Ablett.<br>  <br>  He is a high posession getter & is always kicking goals. <br>  Since he will earn you double, he is the best choice and will defently gain you a stack of points.|`|WifhQyD4aa	any one of them usually average between 90 - 110,<br>  <br>  Judd and Ablett usually get 2 or 3 more big scores during the season though.|`|0Dai75rcaa	I'd say Ablett without a doubt, if you can afford him. He is by no means inconsistent, and often pulls best on ground performances. Joel Corey is the only cat with any chance of ending up with a higher average ranking than him, but all signs are pointing towards Ablett having an even better year than last year, when he scored, one week, the second highest score recored in champion data.<br>  <br>  All the best, but I'd say you're wasting double points with Harvey or Judd. They're good, but Ablett would be much better.<br>  <br>  Judd's a great player, but his form last year was a little inconsistent, since he was recovering from injury. Harvey only plays well when the whole team does. Don't get me wrong - he can be great, but if the team's down, he usually is too. And going on last night, it looks like North are in for a rough season, and therefore Harvey, too.|`|sxnbQ6jEaa	dude... its ur decision.. who is ur fav.. ive got all three of those players in but cox is my captain,!!!!!!! although if i had to choose from them three it would be tough, and also look at who is going to give you the most points coz ur captain gets double right... id prob go with ablett at that!!!|`|BQ7rS5m2aa	Ablett inconsistent? Oh my. Personally, I've got Ablett as my captain.|`|hTruYNUQaa	I would go for Chris Judd..|`|tPFikOY7aa	Picking one captain for the whole isnt smart. Each week look at the fixture, see whos playing then base it on that. For instance if there playing west coast or fremantle then look to pick a good player that you may have in that match.|`|aTPJXwidaa	brent Harvey for sure the others are a bit inconsistent.|`|CcFCKSuuaa	Tonite's game should have answered that question for you<br>  <br>  180 SC points in half a game for Gabbett|`|PUrcraj4aa	Luke Hodge., or Matty Richardson
BiMkowVMaa	Nate Robinson. But only because he jacks up 25 something shots to score 18 points. Paul actually tries to get his team involved.<br>  <br>  If Paul was as shot happy as Nate (especially in D'Antoni's offense) he'd easily be a top 3 to 5 scorer.|`|wdFwirb4aa	Chris Paul.  :)|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Chris Paul Obviously!|`|tk4PLUvnaa	sports are pointless. pun intended.|`|T8G0wOXQaa	CP3|`|rvl2f6ERaa	paul|`|5oflV3OVaa	Nate can have more scoring opportunities considering my team does not have any scorers other than him. <br>  <br>  Paul has to dish AND score which is simply incredible considering he gets a double double every night.<br>  <br>  Its a toss-up. I would say Nate though since I am a Knicks fan lol|`|aaeL2wDBaa	Chris Paul got a doubble doubble at the allstar game.

Let's try 2004, fined and points deduction for cursing during post-race interview, 2007, 100 driver points, 100 owner points, 6 race crew chief suspension for illegal rear wing brackets, but yeah they play favorites for Jr. Bullsh*t.|`|Cf7rZsyzaa	really your gonna judge his driving, have you opened your eyes to any races. you people come on here and eat up jr mistakes, you criticize jr for being the most populart driver etc. your giving him recognition in a situation that you dont give other drivers recognition. there are plenty of drivers that have horrible nights and look like fools but you say nothing....why is that?|`|0829df852fa519b2e4acb82ff156a13eaa	Uhhhhhhhh....No. Who are you to judge a frustrated driver who has a lot to live up to and live down from?

Uyz6iZwKaa	I would say 1 because it makes the experience better when you have a mate with you at the games and maybe it will entice him to become more involved in nrl which is what we need right now.|`|yzKrwvxSaa	i would say 3 because i hav tried 2 and 3 and it felt like a waste of money getting membership because if you dont go to all the games your just wasting money. and also, i got pretty bored of penrith losing each week (it might be different with the storm lol) but if you buy tickets to individual games, your pretty sure your gonna go to it and the state of origin is the best rugby league you can get in my opinion. my first state of origin was in Sydney when brett finch kicket the field goal. ive been to every sydney game since then|`|HZ2hwlsjaa	As a Storm supporter in Queensland, I suggest you should get 1 or 2.

I wouldnt worry you will be fine, have fun, and good luck...|`|m3fzi7vlaa	I would try to get a healthy amount of protein in my diet and take and ice bath.

M8XmhqIhaa	Well most of the time, good batsmen aren't even conscious that they're watching the ball onto the bat so well. Its just like instinct for most. You've gotta do what every other cricket player was told to do, watch the ball as closely as you can right out of the bowler's hand and practise, practise, practise! Soon, you should be able to watch the ball onto your bat without thinking about it too much.|`|AA11088802	im not a batsman nor bowler|`|kecdkv6jaa	I'm a lower order batsmen and by the time my shots are finished my head is looking up at the clouds!!<br>  I'm an opening bowler that comes in about number 8 for a slog, (i can sometimes play defensive though, and you have to watch the ball from the bowlers hand onto the bat)|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	I use to bat way down the order, and I just tried to hit tha ball, and hope I could get a run.

Xasu9Ym9aa	On our team the hitters will hold up numbers to tell everyone else how many hitters our in the front row.

7f2GSDmqaa	No. Davari is getting a big push as Shiek Adbul Basheer in TNA, and Mark Copani (Muhammed Hassan) left wrestling for acting, so he wont be back|`|sqfjfR3iaa	He is under contract to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. considering how World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) treated him when he worked there, why would he want to come back?|`|GqhfNeGaaa	Daivari is in TNA as Shiek Abdul Bashir and you probably wont see him back in WWE anytime soon, and Muhammed Hassan got kicked out of the WWE because his character was too controversial with the war in the middle east, so you probably wont see either back anytime soon|`|UbUSth5haa	Muhammad Hassan said he will never return to wrestling so no for him, and Daivari probably will since he is still wrestling with TNA|`|bE5fG9vDaa	no, there probably to busy blowing a country up! nah, i'm just playing. i don't think they will return.|`|3nN1vTTuaa	nope, they're done with the wwe.|`|eXZ5O8vdaa	I doubt it.

Keep in mind, as with a lot of the Caribbean players, he is probably 5 or so years older than his stated age.  <br>  <br>  He's probably done as a regular Major Leaguer - he might get signed if a team gets hit with a rash of injuries, but only as a stop gap measure, and would likely be a swing man out of the bull pen.|`|AA10263761	He Has Bad Knee's|`|yk4S7uuraa	He's a free agent, and wants to be a reliever this year.

hfH8c1LWaa	well, height and weight also come into play along with ur age. im guessing ur average for a 14 yr old, so i would recommend a 125-150cc 4 stroke, something like a TTR125 or CRF150. they are great bike to learn on and if u get an "upper level" bike like a crf150 big wheel, it can have good race potential (with some mods of course)|`|IudQftm4aa	Well if you havent rode in about 5 years. I would find a practice bike to get your balance and cordnation back. If your about 14 should be in around the 85cc/150r class. These bikes are small, but pack a punch. I would start out cheap with a ttr125, or crf100/xr100 maybe even a crf80. Master these with shifting and clutch control then you can move to a race model. If you track ride 3 times a week you could be racing in a few months.|`|tSCE2uk5aa	if your just learning then i suggest a suzuki 150 4stroke air cooled..its a somewhat fast bike but nothing insane,no matter what anybody says dont get a 2stroke its way to fast 4 a non-experienced rider

Really it depends on your skill level and your riding type preference.|`|qK1w972yaa	You forgot to say what area your from...We always have bikes for sale..We get bikes in and go through everything from linkage bearings to total motor rebuilds...when we are done we want the bike good enough to put our own kids on them..But..We are on the Oregon coast.

xsaxyB1gaa	When I was younger and in high school I was always a little confused by the cheerleaders. I was offended that they would actually consider it a sport, I guess because I was a softball and basketball player and I couldn't see any similarities between what I consider to be a sport and cheerleading. However, with that being said, I've never downed a cheerleader and I've always given people and their hobbies respect because that's what they love to do and what makes them happy.|`|pKrsOPOkaa	yeah. it takes strength. competitiveness. (strength.) :)<br>  im a cheerleader. :)|`|N1LYWbHFaa	i'm a cheerleader and yes its very competitive and dangerous, im about to be in a competition in a couple of weeks and ive been practicing for a long time! People don't realize how hard it is,<br>  <br>  <br>   and wow i just posted a question about it too!|`|SKt1y1gzaa	Cheer leading is very hard like they say in bring it on its just like gymnastics except no beam, bars, vault just floor. Being a gymnast you do somethings we do on the floor but i don't think i would ever be able to go so high in the air and want someone to catch me. Theres things you guys could never dream of doing either, like doing back handspring on beam. Personally cheer leading out fits are very cute but i like leotards better..lol|`|1VXgD6kDaa	when i used to be a cheerleader it was tough! we used to do the pyramid until.....one day a girl who really hated me threw a water bottle at my head. i landed face down on the cold soil.i had to go to the hospital for stiches. but u know wat u can achieve anything if u set ur mind to it:)|`|AUsvrW8faa	O M G, competition cheerleeding is very hard.<br>  <br>  You've got to practice, to practice, prac prac, to practice!<br>  <br>  The moves are technical and you've got to know what you're doing, your doing  - do, do  - you're doing!<br>  <br>  My niece was competing for a while so I know.....I know, I , I -  I know.....LOL<br>  <br>  But seriously, it is a tough competitive sport. Gotta bring your A game.|`|c1yfnzuVaa	I don't really like cheerleading, but I have to admit.. It is a tough sport and physically demanding.<br>  <br>  I've always wanted to be in gymnastics...but you have to start early and work hard on it years. So I understand how difficult it is.<br>  <br>  So good job being a competitive all-star cheerleader :)|`|DQlZIzAFaa	competitive cheer, where you do flips and carry each other and actually move and be coordinated IS a sport. it takes talent, teamwork, muscle. you could even argue that it takes more teamwork than basketball because it's so coreographed.<br>  <br>  however, at my high school, the "cheerleaders" basically just sat around chanting and occasionally frollicked in a semi-coordinated fashion and then got drunk and sucked off all the football players after the game. that is not a sport.|`|VbvrG9NJaa	Yeah I think cheerleading is hard and I mean like I tried it and I threw up twice because I couldn't stomach what I just ate with the things that we had to do!  Another this is that those people who say that cheerleading is for sluts and for stuck up brats, well its not thats just what they went threw but they never really meat the people or at least not all the cheerleaders are cold.|`|jqdgXcOeaa	omg!!...it's probably one of the most intense hardcore sports that involves strength, stamina, flexibility, cheerfullness, and energy, and smiles, dedication and a whole lot more!!!!<br>  answer mine??.it's about johnny depp!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlDgzQ1B2nza__xLLldPgQHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220145105AAB5JaS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vm5TgsQwaa	My younger sister does it<br>  shes 13<br>  and she goes to a gym where a girl had a condition and bled to death<br>  (East Elite -Massachusetts)<br>  Then she got hit in the head while catching a girl and fell to the ground gt a concusion and they still made her work<br>  <br>  So I guess...|`|5LWq12epaa	I love cheerleading<br>  I am going 2 try out for cheerleading<br>  and i agree, competitive is the hardest|`|CWW0V7kOaa	Well ...

c6q3EERdaa	The Cubs signing Milton Bradley most likely means that Fukudome won't be used much anymore, so why shouldn't they go after someone like Washburn or Bedard? I thought Fukudome was a major disappointment for the Cubs last season.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	Im a big cubs fan, and i definitely think that the cubs should get riddance of kosuke fukudome. he was a waste of a player and is probably in the top 10 list of last years most overrated players. the cubs should fill his spot with reed johnson or matt fontenot (reed's a top fielder and fontenot's a homerun hitter). they should trade him and get either a pitching or a good fielding prospect. i would say that bedard or washburn for fukudome are great trades (even though i support the bedard rumored trade).|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	That would be awesome if the Mariners get Fukudome to team up with Ichiro.<br>  <br>  But if I was the Mariners I wouldnt give up Bedard.|`|wBxXGASgaa	i would say they keep fukudome cause yea good d but didn't put him in that much but if we do trade with mariners i expect ichiro with a cubs jersey|`|fKAnnQeWaa	No way. Fukudome has not only helped the Cubs as a team but as a business as well. He has filled an everlasting hole defensively in Right Field, not everyone can play that wall at Wrigley. He brought a whole group of people as fans (Fukudome being the 1st ever Japanese to wear a Cubs uniform). <br>  <br>  Fukudome also being one of the faster runners on the club is also, probably, the best defensive player on the Outfield. He has power, speed and takes a hell lot of walks. He just hasn't been able to show them because he is adjusting to practically a whole new lifestyle. <br>  <br>  To elaborate on that I will explain here. In Japan, they play about 40 less games than in the MLB. He also has to endure all the traveling since in Japan he did not travel as much. In Japan, the hours are different. So by the time that he is accustomed to sleep, he has to be up and vice versa. And as you said, he had to learn a whole new community of ball players. He needed to learn how to speak English. The only people he could speak Japanese were Alfonso Soriano, yes, he does speak it, and his translator Ryuji Araki. So think about it, if you had to move a country where the hours, language and community were different how would you feel?<br>   <br>  Now that he has a complete season under his belt I think that he will show us what kind of a player he was to earn a 4 year contract.<br>  <br>  What you are saying is true. The Cubs do not need more pitching. Which puts the Bedard rumors to bed. But what you are saying about Fukudome being a bench player is completely wrong.<br>  <br>  The deal was to platoon Johnson and Fukudome. What "platoon" means is just that they will share the position and their play time will vary whether the Cubs are playing a Right Handed or Left Handed pitcher that day. <br>  <br>  If Lefty = Johnson <br>  If Righty = Fukudome <br>  <br>  So in a way, he is not a bench player.
iz5zDFxvaa	They might. We'll just have to see|`|mwxKnUleaa	It will depend if they are up for the challenge ahead. they are capable of making the playoffs, but are at times inconsistent. In the end I think its going to be a battle for the 8th and final spot between the Bucks, Knicks, and the Bulls.

x9GODf8eaa	It serves 3 basic functions, but can be used other ways.<br>  <br>  1. Wax is water repellent, so the tape will not get wet, reducing overall weight<br>  2. Wax makes your tape stronger, meaning it will not wear out as fast, saving you money on tape in the long run.<br>  3. Wax is tacky, which adds a little bit of grip (meaning control) on the puck. Better (slightly) stickhandling.<br>  <br>  Can also be used to add grip to the shaft of your stick, but now grip sticks are getting better, and nothing beats a tape spiral.|`|DCNL73ZJaa	I'll make this short and sweet wax repells water strengthens tape and gives you better grip on the puck|`|rvE7gyuUaa	Stick wax is designed to prevent water from effecting the quality of your blade.  <br>  <br>  Pros: The wax beads water and allows it to run off easily keeping the blade dry.  The wax will also slightly strengthen the tape and make it last longer.  With enough wax, there is also a slight grip effect on the puck. <br>  <br>  Cons:  Depending on the amount of wax you use, with a large amount of wax on the entire blade, the blade may become heavier and the excess wax does effect the feel of the puck until you get used to it.  <br>  <br>  Another option: friction tape (sticky on both sides tape) is similiar but more consistant every use.|`|yTb3AlOvaa	While wax does repel water, making your stick weigh less, the main purpose for it is puck control. Sometimes youll find that the puck rolls of your stick even though youre doing all the right things. This is usually because your blade is wet. This is why a lot of people put stick wax on.<br>  <br>  As well, if you want to try it without buying it, before a practise, take a crayon the same colour as your tape and colour over your tape. Crayons are wax, so this will have the same affect. Of course stick wax works better, but this will help you get the idea if you like it or not. Good luck.|`|hz8YjsJPaa	keeping the snow off you stick and water

MUERDKyzaa	End of the day, people complaining about overpaid footballers can shut up because if they weren't getting the money, it would just be the chairmen getting that extra 5 mill per player. Imagine if people had to pay ￡100 to get into a hospital, then obviously the doctor's are gonna get more money. A prem footballer from a rich club is clearly going to get more money than a Conference player because of club revenue. And if all the money was going to the chairmen, no one would be complaining about overpaid footballers because the chairmen would be in the public eye 24/7 and newspapers use the fact that some footballers get loads of money to sell their stories and share the hate with the reader.<br>  This is called negative cohesion, where you bond through a dislike of an evil, and btw the nazis used this tactic in their propoganda against jews and gypsies etc... And im not saying all journalists are Nazis lloll|`|p8lB73rdaa	So you think it's right to be paid 100grand a week to play football do you ?<br>  An average nurse would come out with about 500 quid after a week of cleaning other people's piss , Shite and blood and watched god knows how many people die !<br>  <br>  Kop on !|`|f2AWSb48aa	I suspect the reason that I, and many other people have that opinion, is because footballers get payed 10x the amount an average person might earn in a year, in a single week, just for kicking a sack of air around a field.<br>  This is, in many people's opinions, a completely pointless waste of money, and contributes nothing of any good to anybody (aside from the entertainment perhaps) <br>  Wheareas doctors, surgeons, engineers, architects etc. actually save lives, contribute to society, and yet they are constantly ridiculed by the media for not reaching NHS targets etc. etc. and they get payed practically nothing compared to these wealthy football idiots.<br>  <br>  I can see both sides of the argument, and realise what you have argued is also true. But it frustrates people when good people dont get the respect or money they deserve.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	only top teams pay far too much to football players , they end up with very large houses and can do whatever they want in there breaks from football , they get the money from the exhorbitant prices at the turnstiles , most hard working men cant go to the match as it costs too much money|`|Iqco1PcQaa	footballers should be paid a maximum of ￡20 per hour, for the 90 mins they play and the time training, football went out of the window when money took over, now that is all it is about, money, not sport.|`|o7gV56ngaa	I agree mate. Just look at the American socialist sports system where teams are restricted to wage caps.

Because of sponsorship, tickets, prize money, sales, whatever are effectively decided my on the pitch performances. If the players are responsible for making so much profit and success then they deserve a share of it. If its a couple of millions out of 300 hundred million for a player then in a way its fine.<br>  <br>  But lets look at the effort they hae to put in. In reality they have jobs they love to do and are naturally good at. Like someone said, there are people with jobs that involve stuff you don't really want to do for a hobby and which have some emotional hurt. The effort footballers put in doesn't justify their effort and work rate. <br>  <br>  Lets remember they also risk serious injury and media intrusion.|`|OwjgwJQEaa	people love amusement and football is one of the amusement as it brings amusements to people that's way people pay week after week to watch the game making the footballer rich instead of saving the fans saving there money for some thing great ie buy house or something.|`|zWZe6wA0aa	Footballers get paid so much because of sponsorship, investment, media etc.<br>  <br>  Consultants do earn a alot, up to ￡160,000 a year which is quite good, but there is alot of hard work involved.|`|FN11c540aa	footballers only do 3 days of training and play 90 minutes once or twice a week sometimes so yes i think 40,000 to 150,000 pound a week is a bit to mutch|`|OYHr9zFaaa	They get paid alot because most of them run for 90 minutes plus training thats pretty hard to do|`|KDChZAzlaa	Classic rant, on that note i think my doctor should be sponsored by Always,cuz he′s a right twat.|`|rfCGWFNcaa	id happily settle for doctors wages all they do is sit there and pretend to ruddy listen|`|Bl6ctutYaa	Generally speaking the majority of people (not including footballers) will say they are getting payed too much without thinking about it because frankly they are just running about with little value unlike doctors, but i'm sure if everyone looked into it deeply some opinions may change.|`|2nsNvIanaa	this happens in all countries. the thing that gets on my nerves is a player who gets paid  a **** load then is 2 scared 2 commit & plays mediocre.<br>  did beckham really earn his wage in america ?? i think not. i av nothing against him just an example.
S0u3HKzhaa	Calm down,Triple H is most likely going to get traded to Raw and John Cena to Smackdown.So your in luck the wwe title will be on Raw again.I agree I like it better there to.But Stephanie or Shane being McMahon's will be able to make the trade,so Triple H can play a role in this McMahon Orton feud.Because he is Stephanie's real life husband as you said and storyline ex husband.(Who I don't know if they are making it Triple H and Stephanie are married and they are going to actually admit it on air,or Triple H has feeling for his ex or something).But it will probably be like that so Triple H can be apart of the McMahon family have the title and Orton and him can have a a match at Wrestlemania 25 for the title.And it would be a fair trade Cena for Triple H main event for main event,and Edge and Cena had that confrontation on Raw about the belt so it makes sense.That is what I think is going to happen anyway.But I have to agree Triple H looked like he was trying to Hulk up.|`|qt7QcmtPaa	Well if Edge and Vickie keep making out im gonna barf.

Ucbnl7VJaa	The PS is the semi-automatic model with a barrel(or barrel/muzzlebrake) measuring at least 16". As for modifying one to the P90 standard you'd need a barrel and the full auto fire-control group from a P90. Besides that issue they have probably manufactured the PS90 receiver to prevent the fitting of P90 fire-control parts. <br>  <br>  Now if only we could get BATFE to allow new production selective-fire weapons to be purchased under NFA. So many nice designs around these days.

MWEn7fcwaa	Yeah, I saw that. Don't you think that if he wrestled, and wrestled really well, it would possibly cast a more obvious light on the acting side of the business? We all know pro wrestling isn't "real", there's story lines and creativity involved, but if an actor came in and was as effective a wrestler as some of the big pros who have been doing this for years, it might make them all look bad.<br>  I think that might have something to do with it.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Was he invited?<br>  <br>  I thought Vince McMahon wasn't all that happy with the movie "The Wrestler", due to the negative light in which it portrays the world of professional wrestling - so I'd have assumed Rourke wouldn't have been welcome at Wrestlemania.|`|s6RaRMldaa	yea he was told he can be a spectator at the event, but who knows in the WWE.

CBVlu3Gvaa	You can pick your ball up on the fairway provided you are actually playing "Lift, Clean and place"  This is usually a local rule in tournament play( generally after a rain storm that has left conditions muddy).....but can be done in regular play if all parties in the group agree to it before the match begins.  You are also allowed to mark your ball on the green.  you can clean it once it has been marked.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	BINGO!  That is what they're doing.  It's legal.|`|sMjndu1Eaa	The only reason why they did that was most probably because the officials allowed them to do so because there was probably some rain and moisture on the grass and the soil so sometimes their ball might be in the moist or mud ground so they are allowed to put their tee and mark the ball, they can clean the ball and place the ball in a better lie and play it.<br>  And not only Professionals can do that, even a B or C grade golfer can do that on club competitions when they are allowed to/let known to before the competition starts.|`|ThhLaA32aa	Once you're on the green you're allowed to mark, and clean etc your ball...and then replace it where you marked it.<br>  <br>  THE main reason most golfers "spin it around" is to line up the lettering, logo etc...as an alignment aid.  For instance, many times I play with the NIKE One ball, and since the Nike Swoosh is like a little arrow...I use it and point it toward the hole...or where I want the putt to break etc.  It helps you as you stand over your putt to get the right aim.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ob21L30Laa	you will find that not only are they cleaning the ball but also when they replace it the mark or letters on the ball line up with the hole thus aiding with the aim.<br>  <br>  p.s. there are normally local rules that allow you to pick and clean on the fairway,but not in the rough during winter

oWYs6Btgaa	A gritty forward or defenseman.<br>  <br>  I think they will bring Downey back up (a younger version of Dallas Drake in many ways) and Leino should stay...but I wouldn't rely on Lija or Chelios during the playoffs- they are liabilities.<br>  <br>  I also think that Conklin will be their confidence in net when the playoffs start.<br>  Last year Hasek was their starter- and well, after his meltdown in Round 1- they went to Osgood and got the job done.<br>  We may see the same thing this season. Babcock has shown some tough-love and has given fans reason to believe in him and his decisions. He sees what we see.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	A reliable goalie|`|KyCJOR2paa	I say no one.  I totally disagree with you Harley about Andreas Lilja.  He has been the most consistent defenseman for the Wings this year.  I was ready to throw him under the bus at the beginning of the year, but his play has improved immensely.  He is much better defensively than Kronwall or Rafalski, and up until recently he was playing better than Nick Lidstrom.  Lidstrom lately has returned to Norris form however, so no knock on Lilja, but Lidstrom again is the Wings best D-man.  Also Chelios won't get playing time if the blue line is healthy come playoff time.  Stuart and Lebda should be back.<br>  <br>  I also do not see the need for a goaltending change.  Conklin has proved himself this year, and Osgood is not finished.  Remember... Osgood has a very small cap hit, which is great for the Wings who are quite close to the cap.  They can't afford another goalie without giving up significant salary by trading another player, and most of the players that would be traded wouldn't put a dent in the cap at all.<br>  <br>  The Wings goals against IMO is due to their defensive lapses rather than goaltending.  In the past they rarely gave up shots, but the shots they did give up were always very good chances.  This year they are giving up WAY more shots, logically that translates into more goals against.  They will be fine without any deals, Ken Holland has said it himself.  They have a lot of young guys in the minors who should be in the NHL.  A guy like Darren Helm is the energy guy the Wings have lacked all year, now with him in the lineup again, they are starting to surge.|`|M1aXFtuUaa	No one, WERE AMAZING<br>   <br>  GO WINGS!|`|AA10943884	Matts Sundin|`|j17vl3Nwaa	A goalie who doesn't throw games away|`|yTb3AlOvaa	Honestly, I think, since the wings are almost always near the top of their confrence, they should be trading for draft choices because a lot of their star players are getting old, and there will be a point where some young people need to take over.|`|etErp8rcaa	Gotta agree with the majority. Neither of their current goalies are reliable. If they have a weakness, it's in net.|`|JayU8SfKaa	Alexander Ovecheckin I mean did u c that play???|`|YJBkvhqxaa	Wade Belak.|`|BCWxb9DMaa	ty conklin for fleury

vlISWIOSaa	Hello Bob!<br>  <br>  You actually do need to provide more information! As a rule of thumb for my reloading, I use CCI primers for all of my reloading ... be it rifle, shotgun, or pistol. For rifle loads, I tend to rely on the Benchrest Primers, since they seem to contribute to the accuracy I seek for rifle competition. Unless I am loading either magnum handgun loads or blackpowder cartridges, I lean toward regular primers and reserve the magnum primers for magnum handgun and blackpowder cartridge loads.<br>  <br>  Good luck and good shooting!|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	Whatever primer fits the case. However, unless you have the double-base powder, and proper data, heed this warning from Hodgen's:<br>  "Never mix any two powders regardless of type, brand, or source. Never substitute any smokeless powder for Black Powder or any Black Powder substitute."<br>  I have never seen double-base powder sold by any commercial source, but there are several military powders that fit that description.  To my knowledge, there are no triple base powders.|`|5VELZt7Saa	<a href="http://data.hodgdon.com/cartridge_load.asp" rel="nofollow">http://data.hodgdon.com/cartridge_load.a...</a>|`|H4dswqRlaa	Nitrocellulose based powder technology was aided around the turn of the 20th Century by the addition of about 10% nitroglycerine, which in flake form had enough retardant function of the type needed for handguns, that the 45ACP became possible. Rifle-style retardants already existed at that time. But soon many high energy rifle powders also contained a percentage of nitroglycerine (glyceryl trinitrate), and double-base powders weren't just for pistols anymore! As for triple-based powders, sorry, haven't heard of any. Anyway, over the years, and especially recently, retardant chemistry has come a long way, with new proprietary compact and very high energy powders which reloaders like myself want access to. Perhaps this is what some murmur about as triple-based powders? As for which primer to use, slower burning powders in larger cases usually get magnum primers, but this is not always the case. The #2400 powder is slow, and used mostly in magnum handgun cases, but recently it is discovered that somehow it performs better with a regular primer! Always refer to a reloading manual when reloading. Which type of primer to use is always specified. Regards, Larry.|`|AA11570394	Without ALL the necessary information no one can answer this question. What caliber, what weight projectile, exactly what powder are all needed to know what primer to use. Also for what powder to use requires knowing everything else about the cartridge, bullet and primer. <br>  <br>  This is where load data manuals come in. Playing with data given by un-known sources can end in catastrophe! Do yourself a big favor and get load data from the manufactures.
zvq3uiB6aa	Wow, all of those answers really sucked, and if that girl really played high school volleyball, then she would know what you went by hitting.<br>  <br>  Okay, so make sure ahead of time that you have the approach and the motion down. If you want help with that, I'm sure your coach would help you, or the basics is just (for rightys) step left, then a big jump onto your right, then a little with your left and jump straight up, make sure you don't go forward at all. Also, make sure you bring your arms back, then bring your right up, "scoop" away the air with your left, and swing down as hard as you can with a frim open hand. Then, just practice with a ball! Good Luck|`|wp2mIqTcaa	keep practicing and ask your coach if you can try hitting outside|`|ay62EDDlaa	ok well advice from the others are ok but remember to wait as long as you can tostart your approach.

Also, adjust to where the set is, follow it, and take 4 steps instead of 3... right, left slowlly, then right left fast and furious and finnaly end with a high jump and wide shoulders to the ball. make sure u hav your left side to the ball and follow though wit pullin your right side to the ball.<br>  <br>  Good luk!! and vote for me!! ;)|`|aSdUzlIiaa	When u say hitting like what do u meen Bumping??<br>  <br>  What we do is we call the ball like if ur gonna get it u yell "mine" or if u can't get it u say "help" and just so we are sure we dont miss it when its out evryone that sees it yells "out"|`|jlKX6XfRaa	Perfect practice makes perfect|`|U5KIOutnaa	train hard|`|GOMFKehvaa	Im usually a setter but just recently i became an outside hitter.......try to get top spin on the ball, jump high, get your run up right, make sure you have your arm above your shoulder and most importantly hit the **** out of the ball<br>  <br>  HINT: I always think of my worst enemies when i spike ....it really works just imagine the ball being their face!!!!|`|cbO2JBNIaa	practice a lot, do a lot of core strengthening it will pay off trust me. i have played for 5 years and i became a better volleyball player by strengthening my muscles and practicing and now im #1 starter!!!!!|`|zQ7nFBQDaa	Really work on your approach.... Left right left. The most important thing about hitting like blocking is also timing. Get these two things down and you will be great!

sFXQgQ7taa	Yay skating! :P.<br>  You can learn how to skate at any age, as long as you have determination and consistency. <br>  Your dance experience and quick learning will definitely help you.<br>  Good consistent jumps take a huge amount of practice and dedication, but is very rewarding.<br>  With hard work, you can start jumping within a single year of skating and lessons.<br>  The axel (1.5 turns in the air) will come along in due time. (Within two years if you practice!)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Have fun!|`|ZZVNlXdxaa	So you just started?<br>  <br>  Well it takes a different amount of time for everyone, but since you say <br>  your a quick learner, it might not take to long to learn all that good stuff.<br>  <br>  Im 12 and ive been figure skating for 1 year and a few months and have passed 6 levels. <br>  <br>  Most of the people in my ice skating rink have been in the 1st level for 2 years, mostly cause they never practice.<br>  <br>  You'll need lots of free time, determination, and be flexible and strong if you wanna go far with this sport. <br>  <br>  You should learn an axel in about 2 years if you have all of that.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|0VUg2Cy6aa	All jumps in skating probably takes like a decade or just a little less if your talented. Skating is really difficult and the amateur skaters just make it look easy and plus they skate like 10-15 hours each week!|`|2eW7U8FQaa	The axel jump, named for its originator Axel Paulsen, is an edge jump launched on the forward outside edge and landed on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. Because it has a forward takeoff but lands backwards, a single axel actually has 1.5 rotations. Most people progress at different rates so don't try to be the same as anyone else the best way to do a jump properly is to progress at your own pace and to make sure that what you are doing is right. As you do dance then it may be easier for you to find your balance and get the basics, but just remember that although you may be able to do a jump when you first start you need to work on the landing so you dont end up on your bum. <br>  What i would advise is to watch other people but also to maybe as you get better get private tutoring at you local ice rink, but dont start getting tutoring when you first start as you may not like it. Competitions and learning how to ice skate can be done at any age but some people say that it is easier if you start from when you are little. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|eXvwU3yCaa	it depends on the jump if it is a easy one or a hard one if it is a easy jump then it takes a week or two. Now if it is hard then it takes a month to do it.But it takes a few weeks after to get the jump perfect.|`|HaDR9veDaa	first before you do a triple you will need to have an excellent back spin + double and single axel. <br>  different rates for different people im sure u can do it just practice and have a good coach:)|`|NiRccPGtaa	it takes training, talent, and hard work; especially when starting at such a late age. It won't be easy but if you really want it i see no reason why you shouldn't get it!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|qqVVG1h8aa	Well I ice skated 1 time but from my excperience it will take you about 6 times of ice skating.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rate me best answer!!!!!!!!!!|`|a8EndhDmaa	a life time i did it for 8 years and i was just stating my double axel doubles are difficult you can land but it is landing every time clean is the hard part i think that you are to old :(|`|FZZFJ6awaa	You can do jumps your first time on skates-   Its the landings you want to practice!

kS2lcW6Kaa	No the player who gets the penalty has to go to the penalty box and the Rangers are still 5 - 3 when the 1st player leaves the penalty box. Then, when the 2nd player leaves it goes to 5 - 4 and eventually back to even strength when the 3rd player exits.|`|HxqCHgOLaa	They will put the 3rd guy in the box, but the 3rd guys penalty won't start until the 1st one is finished, but the 1st guy won't be able to come out and join the play when it expires, he will have to wait for a stop in play before coming out, then it's still 5 on 3 until the second penalty expires, then 5 on 4 untill the 3rd period expires, then back to 5 on 5.|`|yTb3AlOvaa	You can have more than 2 people in the box at one time. You can only have at most a 5 on 3. This is why youl never see a 5 on 2. What happens is, hypothetically player 1 and 2 get minor penalties. Then player 3 gets a penalty. Player 3s penalty will start when player 1's penalty is over. That way, it will be like an extended 5 on 3.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	No...he serves his own penalty and goes in the box but his penalty time doesnt start until the first penalty expires. The first guy cant come out of the box until a stoppage in play so there will be 3 guys in the box. If they score before his penalty time starts only the first 2 minutes come off the clock so the rangers in effect remain 2 men down with the fresh 2 minutes starting once the puck is in play again.<br>  <br>  A team can fill the penalty box....they just cant have more than 2 guys minutes on the clock at any given time so each new penalty doesnt start until another comes off the clock either by way of expiration or score by the other team.|`|Iod5edCSaa	there can be more then 2 in the box at a time. I have seen 6 or so in there. But the team cannot be more then 2 men down on the ice at the same time. so the penalized player goes to the box but his 2 minutes does not officially start until the first called penalty is served. The first guy in the box cannot return to the ice however until there is a stoppage in play, then he can skate over to his bench.
CttL3LmBaa	On 1970's era bikes the high gear on a 5 speed was very close  or the same as the high gear on a 10 speed.  Especially Schwinn's.  The outer (big) ring on the front of the 10 speed bike [Schwinn Varsity] had 52 teeth (inner ring was 42).  The front ring on a 5 speed [Schwinn Collegiate] had 52 teeth.  The rear cluster was exactly the same on the bottom gear - 14.  The large gear on them differed as the 5 speed had 32 and the 10 speed 27.  The number of gears on a 10 speed isn't for faster riding, it is to keep in cadence under a wider set of circumstances.  Such as hills and wind direction.  A single speed track bike has a taller gear than a multi-speed bicycle.|`|AA12342474	Typically the highest and lowest gears are close to the same ratios, but the jumps in between the individual gearing ratios are smaller. Think of a bicycle for what it is, a fractional horsepower machine, when you think of gearing... A lot of gears with close ratios will give you higher efficiency and output than a few gears with huge jumps in the ratios. Another way to look at it is, riding up a steep hill in your lowest gear and suddenly shifting to your highest gear, or gradually spinning up through each gear to your highest gear. Most cyclists out there don't seem to make the most of their gears, I hope this helps you.|`|AA11056614	5 and 10 speed bikes differ by the latter having two front gears (Chainwheels or chainrings).  The exact number of teeth varied with the bike, but ~ 40 and ~50 teeth at the front is normal (The back cogs varied between about 13 teeth and 28 teeth. The relative "gear" for each bike is determined, essentially by the ratio of the front to rear number of teeth. Often the "gears" when in the big chainring fall between the "gears" when in the small chainring. So a 10 speed has a top "gear" at maximum ~20% higher (harder) than the same 5 speed bike (assuming the front chainring is the same as the smaller chainring on the 10 speed, or the same if the 5 speed used the larger chainring).<br>  <br>  Today analogous bikes typically have 20 (2 chainrings) or 30 speeds (3 front chainrings). A single front chainring is rare.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	A route is a 'path' or a way to climb to the top of a wall or cliff.<br>  <br>  Inside climbing walls have routes that are marked by different colors.<br>  <br>  Climbs are rated on a 5.0 - 5.15 scale; as follows:<br>  (<a href="http://www.outdoorswithdave.com/climbing/climbing_ratings.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.outdoorswithdave.com/climbing...</a><br>  <br>   5.0-5.4:  Climbing up a ramp or a steep section with good holds.<br>  <br>  5.5-5.7: Steeper, more vertical climbing, but still on good holds. These routes are also easily protected.<br>  <br>  5.8 +/- Vertical climbing on small holds. A + means that the climbing is more sustained like a 5.9, but the route would still be considered a 5.8. If you see a – after the 5.8 rating it means that the climb only has one or two moves like a solid 5.8 would have, but more resembles a 5.7. The + and – are becoming outdated and most guide books have discontinued their use.<br>  <br>  5.9 +/- This rating means that the climb might be slightly overhung or may have fairly sustained climbing on smaller holds. With practice the beginning climber can climb in the 5.9 range quickly and with confidence.<br>  <br>  5.10 a, b, c, d Very sustained climbing. A weekend climber rarely feels comfortable in this range unless they do go EVERY weekend or has some natural talent. The difference between a 5.10 b and a 5.10 c is very noticeable. Most likely the climbs are overhung with small holds and are sustained or require sequential moves.<br>  <br>  5.11 a, b, c, d This is the world of the dedicated climber. Expect steep and difficult routes that demand technical climbing and powerful moves.<br>  <br>  5.12 a, b, c, d The routes in this range are usually overhanging climbs requiring delicate foot work on thin holds or long routes requiring great balance on little holds.<br>  <br>  5.13 a, b, c, d If you can climb upside down on a glass window, these climbs are right up your alley.<br>  <br>  5.14 a, b, c, d These climbs are among the hardest in the world.<br>  <br>  5.15 a This is as hard as climbing gets, folks. Keep in mind that very few climbers can actually climb at this level, although Spiderman eats these climbs for breakfast.<br>  <br>  Climbs are rated by the hardest move on the route. A person who is a solid 5.8 climber theoretically should be able to climb through the crux (the hardest part of the climb) on any route rated 5.8 regardless of the type of rock or area they climb at. That is the theory anyway. Unfortunately, climbs are not rated by a committee of climbers so a particular climb can be off as much as a letter grade or more. Having said that, the majority of climbs you will do will be right on the money.<br>  <br>  Since the destiny of every mountain, cliff, boulder, or pebble is to become like the gravel you walk on to get to the climb, know that ALL RATINGS ARE SUBJECTIVE! Weathering of the rock, the sun, wind and extreme temperatures all contribute to making climbs harder or easier than the rating given to a climb the first time it is established.|`|cAMleGWlaa	A "route" is any path that you can possible take to get to the top of the rock or the desired location on the face of the rock. <br>  If you can imagine it, you can climb it.

eBPApOcxaa	There probably aren't too many ski areas near to an airport of any size. However, the train systems over there are fantastic. Look into flying into either Paris France or Zurich Switzerland and see what ski areas you can get to by train that don't require more than one transfer.  I have been to the Interlaken area of Switzerland, and from the Zurich airport you can probably get a direct train.  You can stay in town and take the train up to either Grindlewald or Murren, There should be plenty of places in the French alps that are easy to get to. I know there are hostels in Interlaken if you need a place to be really cheap|`|wLFM00iiaa	There is a Club Med Resort in Avoriaz in the French alps. There are lots of skiiers as well as snowboarders and they have tons of equipment hire. The facilities are amazing - themed evening, a show every evening etc. great rooms. miles and miles of mountain that goes into switzerland because it is very near the border. loads of ski lifts and levels green, blue, red and 3 different blacks. there are mini buses that go from there to Geneve airport in switzerland which is very close. i would highly recommend it. it is a bit pricey so if you dont want to pay for that there are other small resorts but i think you get your moneys worth x

Your thrust is coming from the knee and below with that type of fin, not your thighs although they're still moving as in a normal kick. If you normally use your thighs as the major source of your power, then going split will be a major change for you. I can't use them personally, since that's where most of my power comes from and how I kick. Straight blade type fins propel me better than splits because of that.|`|t0PzSCs0aa	i'm not sure about the scubapro jet fin, but with most fins, you should try to keep your legs straight, but your knees will be slightly bent. keeping your feet no more than about 6inches apart, kick up with one foot and down with the other, then switch.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  otherwise, you could try this:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3-clwCa32Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3-clwCa3...</a>

On a local radio station, they said Saturday was the goal, but Tuesday is a more realistic date for his return. I have not heard anything other than that.|`|y531A4FAaa	soon I guess. I thought he was out for the rest of the season, groin injuries are pretty serious.
yTb3AlOvaa	Personally, I dont value enforcers very much. Very few of them have real skill and are like dead weight on the ice, because they dont contribute anything. I mean, you might as well be on penalty kill. <br>  <br>  The players you want are the ones with three qualities: smart, strong, skillful. A good example of this is Zdeno Chara. He is smart, he is very skilled and talented and hes strong, but the part thats good is he doesn't take penalties, and while he can act as an enforcer, he can also act as a contributing part of the Boston Bruins.|`|DvBPLP4saa	While an enforcer is nice to have it is not a must need to win the regular season. Playoffs are a different story, though. Playoffs teams are playing tougher and imo if you don't have an enforcer on your team then "bye bye". An enforced is very nice to have during the regular season too, but like I said...I think you could make it without one. But to win the Stanley Cup? Yes, have an enforcer.<br>  ^^^Just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Zdeno Chara (he can act as an enforcer, but he is so much more too), Matthew Barnaby, Georges Laraque, Colton Orr, Eric Godard, George Parros, etc. etc.|`|8m9HXnPfaa	You need to protect your star players, cuz when they get injured, your stuck in a deep pile of crap.<br>  <br>  The habs have laraque, but while he was injured and couldnt play, guess who else got injured:<br>  <br>  Lang<br>  Tanguay<br>  Kovalev<br>  Koivu<br>  Latendresse<br>  etc...<br>  <br>  You get the idea<br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I know this is a bit off topic, but I want to share it with you. Sorry. I used to play NHL 06 a lot (back in 2006) but now I dont have much time. I created the "Greatest Habs" team, with the best players of all time. I had players like richard (both), lafleur, beliveau, cournoyer, plante, roy, dryden, savard, robinson, lapointe, etc... and I also had 2 enforcers. 1 was Chris Nilan (hey the guy had a lot of heart) and the other was John Ferguson (sr.) who played on my farm team. They are actually valuable.|`|9ujT56Maaa	First things first... Laraque is more of a goon than an enforcer.  Enforcers actually have some hockey skill.  <br>  <br>  Anyway... a team can go pretty far in the regular season without a good set of enforcers.  The playoffs are another matter entirely.  You need a few rough physical players to keep the other team from pushing you around as the series heats up.  So in that respect, having an enforcer is essential to a team with Cup aspirations.|`|WX4kxxr8aa	enforcers arent as important these days as they were in the past,im a wings fan and we had our share of them in the past.mccarty,probert,koucer,ect.,now the wings really dont have one and they have still won cups.the sabers need to tighten up their defense grab a couple guys in the free agency market on the blue line and grab a forward or two to get some depth up front and they should be fine|`|D0f7uDtQaa	enforcers get the teamed pumped up, and get the momentum going.

iK9UCuS3aa	Apparently Roland Dane made the comment that in light of the decision by ford to cut funding then the ford signaturing on the car might be replaced with something else. Also it's not really sponsorship money it's more in the way of financial backing. Plus news about the funding being pulled was announced last year at Sandown.<br>  <br>  Ford pulled all financial backing from all teams except for Triple Eight Engineering (Jamie Whincup) and FPR. (Because they have figured that these are the 2 most successful of the ford teams and therefore they will get more money in return through the obvious point of only having the 2 teams to worry about and all the winning they will be doing will give them a profit, somehow)<br>  <br>  The teams still get sponsorship money plus prize money (I'm not sure how much or what places). HRT still gets money from Holden as does other teams in the Holden camp.<br>  <br>  I myself are a second generation Dick Johnson Racing supporter and was shocked at the decision by ford because along with SBR they are probably tied for being the number 3 ford team.<br>  <br>  Reason Holden has so much is because the HRT team has been round since the very early days of the ATCC (Australian Touring Car Championship) Brock drove for them and with his success came loads of money to ensure the further success. And as time has gone by they have invested it and helped it grow into millions. Apart from Skaifes little misadventure, HRT has always had the funds to help them stabilize. <br>  <br>  Roland Dane's comment I think was just a comment made in the heat of the moment.

QC2NozBkaa	Serrated edges are great for cutting rope, straps and such but not too good at fine work.  I have one with a serration at the base and plain at the last 3/4's.  Works well for me.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	A plain edge is much better... the serrated blades<br>  are only useful for cutting up game when hunting,<br>  and even then, they are not really necessary.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	For most purposes a plain edge is the best choice. It's easier to resharpen compared to the serrated design although to most people it will seem to keep cutting well for a longer time. The serrated designs cut tough and/or fibrous material better but don't allow fine controlled adjustments in cutting direction nearly as well. For woodworking this can be a very important issue.|`|yTkNT3OSaa	For general utility I'd always recommend plain edge as they're much more versatile and easier to sharpen.

5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	At only 4ft it seems a little shallow, there will be very little protection for the fish, i think in places you will need depths of up to 8ft possibly 10, to give the fish a place to go in very cold weather or the opposite in very hot conditions, it also gives them a place for shelter and for food. <br>  <br>  Underwater structure is vital, plant life is a good option to as it will attract various aquatic life. Other items like submerged trees etc provide lots of cover for fish.<br>  <br>  With a deeper pond you could stock bass, trout, if its very muddy and has lots of deep holes catfish would thrive.<br>  <br>  You also need to consider oxygenating the pond by either plants or a water feed system, a lake that's spring fed works very well.|`|QC2NozBkaa	Catfish.

(like the Shanahan rumor) However I think it would be great if the Chiefs could bring in someone like a Matt Cassel or even a David Carr who is backing up Eli. I still think Thigpen may be the guy but why put all our eggs into Thigpen's basket like we did with Croyle (7 Starts, 4 season ending injuries, and 7 losses) Great starting material in Croyle. Huard is a career back up. Ingle Martin and Quinn Gray are jokes. I like the thought of getting Matt Cassel but until anythin happens I am not going to get too excited about rumors!|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	As long as Brady is healthy enough to start the season, its a win-win move for both teams.  The Chiefs get a QB that has some NFL experience and played pretty well last year so they don't have to deal with the crap shoot that is drafing a QB.  Also, signing him would be cheaper for the Chiefs than signing a newly drafted QB.      The Pats would probably get the Chiefs  3 pick in the upcoming draft, which should be more than fair compensation for a former 7th round pick with only 15 starts under his belt.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Doan is a great example.  Ryan Smyth was an example for the longest time.  Marcel Dionne was a great example in the past.      Some players just feel like that owe it to the fans (and they hope) and that loyalty is steadfast.    In the case of Smyth, he always believed that the Oilers were 'one body away'.  Doan has a no trade clause and has used it twice in the past to avoid going to such competitive places like Detroit and New Jersey.  There was less movement in the 80s from a free agent standpoint but Marcel Dionne (and Luc Robitaille later on) just loved living in LA.    Some players just find a level of comfort in a place and don't want to move.  For some players, as long as the team, doesn't push them out (like Ryan Smyth a couple of years ago) that team will become their long term home.    In the case of Doan, he'll be a Jet/Coyote as long as they let him!|`|emzQNo0Haa	Some players want to be part of a winning team and some players just want to be the best player on their team.  "Big fish in a little pond."|`|m6lDXAmoaa	People don't want to uproot their families. There's a huge amount of loyalty and brotherhood with the team. You don't want to be the player who leaves for greater things and then misses opportunities (e.g. Mathieu Schneider left Detroit for Anaheim in '07 because they had just won the Cup, that season, Detroit won the Cup and Anaheim got knocked out early). It's a lot of different combination's of things|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	You just never know when a team is going to get good.

Jericho by a mile!|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	Orton could never put his feet in Jericho's shoes|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	One of them is my current favorite RAW superstar, and the other is my 3rd-favorite RAW heel (4th-favorite RAW superstar if you include faces), so I have a high opinion of both at the moment.    Jericho's role doesn't suit him, nor does it showcase his true talents, but he's doing the best he can with it (which is better than what anybody else on RAW, with the possible exception of C.M. Punk, could do with such a role).  For that reason, I have to say he's better than Orton, even though Orton is the one I like better.    Past accomplishments also support Jericho, but I'm basing my answer solely on the present.  Just imagine how good Jericho could be right now if he had even a halfway-decent role (instead of playing the part of the hypocrite who fraudulently points out the hypocrisy in others).|`|awNQ0h2gaa	Chris Jericho by far

65ebebf5e438864d41850ef2be37319caa	Wow, this would actually make total good sense.  The only problem is the salary cap.  For example, Montreal gives up a player and a prospect, but gets two players in return.  Kovalev has a salary cap hit of 4.5 million , while Briere makes 6.5 and Kubina makes 5.  That's an increase of 7 million for Montreal while they only have room for 0.7 million extra.  Stupid salary cap.|`|yTb3AlOvaa	Actually, I think youre really onto something. This would be a productive trade for all of the teams. First, the leafs need young draft choices. I watched PK Subban at the juniors, and he is going to be one of the best defencemen in the nhl one day. <br>  <br>  Secondly, Montreal would greatly benefit from the likes of Pavel Kubina, because Montreal lacks good defence. Im also sure Philly would love Kaberle and Stall.<br>  <br>  However, in terms of Pittsburgh, Alexei Kovalev has already played for them, and clearly they wern't happy with him, because they traded him, so I doubt theyd want him back. As well, while Nik Antropov can be a great player, he is not consistent in goal scoring. Sometimes hes hot and sometimes hes really not. Overall though, good idea - it would be awesome if it ever happened.|`|AA10943884	A good thought out trade.  maybe switch Kaberle for Kubina.  Other than that change, nothing wrong for this deal|`|j17vl3Nwaa	I sure hope this would never happen because without Briere the Flyers are nothing.|`|hz8YjsJPaa	That would be the grestest trade of life|`|1ApbWVhsaa	So the Flyers give up a 30 goal scorer(Also a former All Star),a future superstar(Hopefully) and a first round pick for Staal(Who scored 12 goals last year and isn't setting the world on fire this year)and Kubina(Who has a -9 this year and his career high for goals is 17,which was in the 03-04 season)?Thanks,but no thanks.<br>  <br>  Avs/Flyers-Maybe you don't remember the start the Flyers had with Briere?Now without him they're 4th in the Conference.They can win without him.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***I meant Kaberle..Those are his stats..Not Kubinas.If Carter would have went in that trade last year it would have been very lopsided in the Leafs favor.
