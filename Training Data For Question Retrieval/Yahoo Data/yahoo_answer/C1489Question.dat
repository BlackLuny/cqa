I've been dating this guy for almost two years, and he's black, I'm white. My dad hates the fact that i date him, but i love him so much and he treats me better than anyone else ever has. We had to hide the fact that we were dating for the first couple months and even now dad tries to do anything possible to keep me away from him, including not letting me look at the college I want to go to just because my boyfriend goes there. I'm so sick and tired of it, and i've tried talking to him multiple times but it never works. I really love him and we plan on getting married eventually, and i'm scared my dad won't bless the marriage and that he'll make everything horrible. what should i do?
20090223163022AAYmN95	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How to warn immature parent that I will go to guidance if harassment doesn't stop?	It's a long and weird story... I'll give the short of it:      This boy is extremely misogynistic and immature. He started an extremely nasty rumor about me that his girlfriend (a supposed friend) told him. When I confronted the boy he denied all involvement (despite numerous sources pinpointing him) and had his dad call me. Well, the dad called and buttered me up and all that jazz and said his son would stick up for me with the rumor.      Yeah, right. It's 3 months later and I've heard even worse variations of the rumor all once again pinpointed to this boy. My friend called the dad and he buttered HER up and started talking about me like I was a liar and desperate lost girl. I'm so sick of the rumor, I'm afraid of talking to people in my grade because they'd probably heard it and I want taunting about it from the 'popular boys' to stop! I use to be the shy nice girl until it came up. I'm seventeen years old. The father is single and lives with his son and actually stayed on the phone with my friend and I for more than an hour each conversation because he talks and talks.      What can I say in a text message to this man that is strong and to-the-point??

I am just really confused on why he wont let me do this...      do you think I should just go behind his back and do it? I don't want him to think he can control me.

I'm 20 years old and I consider myself a person of chivalry, dignity, etiquette, well mannered, and absolute majesty. I am a guy and I am 100% straight. I have a roommate that constantly burps and farts, he does them loud constantly. He chews extremely loud like a dog or hog chews. He constantly plays his Rap-Crap music loud which overpowers all other sound. He likes to open the window as far as it can go so all the freezing air of the outside winter season enters the room. Last night I was on my laptop and he turned off the light. Right after he got into his bed he let out loud farts. I was absolutely disgusted and left the room to get away from his the piggish actions he did. Can anyone offer suggestions on how I can deal with all the disgusting things this pig does?

Dear Randall,       A new report released just hours ago reveals that U.S.-made white phosphorus artillery shells among other U.S. weapons were found throughout Gaza.

In light of this new finding, we are urging Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to immediately call for:      an investigation into Israel’s use of U.S. arms in Gaza    a suspension of U.S. military aid to Israel and    to urge the United Nations to impose an arms embargo on all parties in the conflict

20060910062003AAb5fvA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why can't religious people accept Macro-Evolution when they accept Micro-evolution?	It seems even the most hardcore apologists like Kent Hovind (spelling?) accept that micro-evolution takes place. For those that don't know, micro-evolution says that an animal, for example a bird, can grow a bigger beak if the environment favors this trait. So why is it that they can't accept that say a land animal could develop wings and go from one species to a totally different looking one? It seems to logically follow through to me.      P.S.

Va la mía:   Nosotros tuvimos varios perros de la raza pastor alemán, pero uno de ellos era especial: Fritz.  Cuando construimos cierta área de la casa, mi marido dejó un pedacito de tierra y le dijo: cuando te mueras, brother, te vamos a enterrar allí.   A?os después, un día que llegamos no lo encontrábamos y ?saben dónde se fue a echar porque estaba moribundo y allí murió?   Donde mi esposo le había dicho: ?cómo entendió él lo que era morirse y enterrarse?   ?No es maravilloso?      Además siempre defendía a mi hijo mayor. Desde que llegamos a dar la noticia del embarazo, el Fritz me besaba la barriga y siempre estaba a mis pies. En cuanto nació el ni?o dejó de hacerme caso. Y siempre lo defendía, de hecho, nos ladraba si pensaba que lo estábamos rega?ando...      ?Fritzito... te extra?amos, eras el Robert Redford de los perros!  ?Fuiste una linda bendición!

20090223165642AAqGFwM	Society & Culture;Languages	TRANSLATE THIS TO ITALIAN?	Guglielmo Marconi was an Italian inventor who is best known for his invention, the radio telegraph system. He was born near Bologna, Italy in 1874. He was baptized as a catholic and was a member of the Anglican Church. Marconi was educated in Bologna in the lab of Augusto Righi, in Florence at the Istituto Cavallero, and also in Livorno. As a child, Marconi did not do well in school. During his early years, Marconi had an interest in science and electricity. Marconi began to conduct experiments, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio, Italy. His goal was to use radio waves to create wireless telegraphy. Many others inventers had tried to accomplish this but none of them succeeded. In early 1896 at the age of 21, Marconi traveled to London, England, accompanied by his mother to seek support for his work. His work interested a man named William Preece. Preece introduced Marconi's ongoing work to the general public at two important London lectures. In June 1897, Marconi started seeing international attention. Marconi introduced a whole new way of communication to the world. On 16 March 1905, Marconi married Beatrice O'Brien. They had three daughters. In 1914 Marconi was made senator in the Italian senate. Marconi won many awards in honors including being inducted to the New Jersey hall of fame.

Abu Bakr as-Siddiq said, "Messenger of Allah! Are we not their brothers? We entered Islam as they entered Islam and we did jihad as they did jihad."

I included that third category for those who can only see these sorts of matters as either being black or white.        It seems to me that if the Bible talks about baptism, period, with no mention whatsoever of age, then the matter DOESN'T matter.  It is NON-BIBLICAL.  And I see no reason for asking further questions about it.  It would be like asking for special verses in the Bible wanting clarification about what kind of bread the five loaves were, or what kind of fish the 2 fishes were.      If you see baptism as being about actual sin and not original sin, then fine, but why not accept that others understand the Bible differently than you do, and baptize infants for the remission of original sin?

20090222142918AAP41kB	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	She thinks I'm gay, but I'm not?	Well, I recently found out a boyfriend of mine was cheating on me. My friend was super nice to help and listen to me, but she invited a friend, but that's okay. I just realized that my friend's friend is gay, which I have nothing against. But, I told her that I just don't have an interest for guys anymore. She obviously took it the wrong way, because I meant I don't feel like relationships because their all JERKS! Not because I have an interest for women.    She asked me to see a movie a couple days ago, and I love movies, and I'd go with anyone. But, it just got too awkward for me. She started putting her hands around my waists, and I am just so uncomfortable with this whole situation! Can you give me any advice to tell her that I'm not interested in her, but without hurting her feelings? I think she's a really nice person, but nothing more then that.

20090222151959AA3Dya2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The Holy Spirit—Third Person of Trinity or God’s Active Force?	While the consensus of the religious teaching of Christendom today may ascribe divinity to God’s holy spirit, such was not always the case. Note, for example, the words of Neander, of whom McClintock and Strong’s Cyclop?dia states: “Universally conceded to be by far the greatest of ecclesiastical historians.” Though himself a trinitarian, he wrote: “In A.D. 380, great indistinctness prevailed among the different parties respecting this dogma so that a contemporary could say, ‘Some of our theologians regard the holy spirit simply as a mode of divine operation; others as a creature of God; others as God himself; others again, say that they know not which of the opinions to accept from their reverence for Holy Writ, which says nothing upon the subject.’”       Is God’s Word ambiguous on the subject of the holy spirit? Does it fail to indicate clearly whether God’s holy spirit is God himself, a creature of God or a mode of divine operation?

This isn't about that.      I'm asking about anti-prejudice laws against gays.      Basically in some states their still isn't a law protecting gays from being fired from jobs for being homosexual. A gay man or lesbian could walk into work and be fired because "you are a homosexual". (If i understand correctly)       What is your opinion on this? Do you think homosexuals should have a law protecting them from losing their jobs? Do you have any statistics about this law?

20090222151109AAzwNqg	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Question for Muslims?	I found almost no Muslims in religion and spirituality, and a lot of trolls.  sorry this isn't really about Ramadaan.      I'm an atheist who was raised as an atheist, and I know little about any religion. As an exploration, and an attempt to understand others, I have recently taken an interest in religion. I started by studying Christianity, since it is very common where I live, but because of my new interest in religion, a Muslim friend of mine thought to introduce me to Islam.      Naturally, as an atheist, I asked about science, and where Islam stands on the big bang, evolution, etc. It turns out that, while my friend is a very devout Muslim, he likes science, and believes in it. He told me the Islamic creation story, and I found, not only that it does not contradict modern science, but that it in fact goes with it well. He quoted the Quran for me several times, but this one I found particularly striking:      "All that is in our sky was as smoke, and God said "come ye together, willingly or unwillingly.""      The solar system was once nothing but a cloud of ionized gas. It was, in fact "as smoke". This quote alone, I would have thought little of, but he mentioned at least ten off the top of his head that are just as scientifically sound.      The Christians say that scientific/religious contradictions are a test of their faith, as is their inability to fully understand the nature of god. According to my friend, in Islam, these things are considered detrimental to faith, and therefore, explanations of such things as the nature of god, and his plan, and his goals for us, as well as accurate scientific information, are provided in the Quran. Our daily lives have all the tests god wishes for us to pass in life without having to deal with scientific data that contradicts him, or a total lack of understanding of his true nature as added tests.      After a couple of our discussions, I was very interested to learn more about Islam, but I have barely begun. This all happened in the last week. I trust my friend, but I thought it might be beneficial to hear from more than one Muslim. First, are there any beliefs that Muslims must have that explicitly contradict known principles of science (evolution, the big bang, etc.). My second question is a bit more complicated;      My friend made Islam sound very rational, so much so that I, a completely godless soulless atheist who believes only in science, could understand everything he said. I haven't studied enough to know whether it is that rational or not but if we assume it is (since I assume most Muslims will make that claim); Part of every religion I really know much about is believing in the irrational. It is not normally part of human nature to have faith that way. However, many people have such a strong will to survive that it leads them to believe in irrational things because they can't handle knowing that death truly is the absolute termination of one's existence (which is what I believe). That fear of absolute death, I think, is what keeps atheism from sweeping the planet, and wiping out all belief in all gods. If Islam is something rational that provides eternal life, that meets everyone's needs. If Islam is such a thing, why does it not sweep the planet? If it can combine science and logic with eternal life, no one would ever be anything but a Muslim. As rational as my friend says Islam is, I take the existence of any other ideology, including atheism, as evidence that there is some kind of catch. If it is all that, why would anyone ever NOT be a Muslim? If there is irrationality, what is it? If not, why are there non-Muslims in the world?

20090222113602AAskS84	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan Section,  Philosophy of Durrod?	In all organized systems, there is a standard way of doing every thing and a defined consequence (award, reward or punishment) of doing that task is expected. Our religion, Islam,  a highly organized and logical system, provides us with a beautiful interlacing of our religious and worldly affairs, offering great compliance in all matters for our convenience, yet giving each issue it's due share of importance.      The great deal of ajar (reward) our Rab (Allah) promises us demanding only a small chunk of our time.   Zikr-e-Allah earns us great amounts of ajar in a matter of seconds, provided our intentions and sincerity play their part.      And remember your Lord within yourself humbly and fearing and in a voice not loud in the morning and the evening and be not of the heedless ones.   Quran [7:205]      O you who believe! remember Allah, remembering frequently, And glorify Him morning and evening.   Quran [33:41-42]      Allah`s beloved is Muhammad (SAW), so logically thinking, praising Muhammad (SAW) shall earn us lots of ajar too. The way prescribed by Allah to praise Muhammad (SAW) is to send blessings to him (SAW) that is durood, and the reward promised by Allah for this is great. Allah says in the Holy Book;       Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation.   Quran [33:56]      Allah sends His Salah on the Prophet, and also His angels (do so). O you who believe! Send your Salah on him, and greet him with Taslim   Quran [33:56] Translated by Ibne Kathir      Al-Bukhari said: "Abu Al-`Aliyah said: "Allah's Salah is His praising him before the angels, and the Salah of the angels is their supplication.'' Ibn `Abbas said: "They send blessings.'' Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi said: "This was narrated from Sufyan Ath-Thawri and other scholars, who said: `The Salah of the Lord is mercy, and the Salah of the angels is their seeking forgiveness. There are Mutawatir Hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah commanding us to send blessings on him and how we should say Salah upon him. We will mention as many of them as we can, if Allah wills, and Allah is the One Whose help we seek. In his Tafsir of this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Ka`b bin `Ujrah said, "It was said, `O Messenger of Allah, with regard to sending Salam upon you, we know about this, but how about Salah' He said: (Say: "O Allah, send Your Salah upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your Salah upon the family of Ibrahim, verily You are the Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious. O Allah, send Your blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibrahim, verily You are Most Praiseworthy, Most Glorious.'') This Hadith has been recorded by the Group in their books with different chains of narration.   Tafsir Ibne Kathir, Tafseer of Surah 33, Verse 56      I noted the way Allah addresses His people in general in the Quran, He talks in a very loving manner, Just like parents who offer various incentives to their children for doing every task they are asked to do, even though the task is beneficial for children themselves. Usual way of instruction, by Allah is "do this so that you get success". For example;      Those who believe and do not mix up their faith with iniquity, those are they who shall have the security and they are those who go aright.   Quran [6:82]      The ones who believe in truth are being promised security. But notice the way Allah is talking about His beloved messenger (SAW). He says send blessings on Muhammad (SAW), not because it is for our own good, but also because Allah Himself does so, also His angels.      It is not a normal Quranic order. It is something more than that, Alot more. Sending blessings on Muhammad (SAW) makes us, the ordinary mistake-makers humans, do an act that Allah Himself does. This is why I think of this ajar to be beyond the limits of description.      Ever thought about the point that why does Allah offer so much for sending durood to Prophet Muhammad (SAW), Durood, a few words of Arabic about Muhammad (SAW) and his blessed progeny? Why does Allah want so many blessings to be sent to Muhammad (SAW)? Do Muhammad (SAW) and his Ahlulbayt need our prayers to help them (SAW) to paradise? Is he (SAW) dependant on us, the sinners of today, for his Salvation, or attaining a status which none but He (SAW) deserves?      Certainly no. It is us who need to send durood on Muhammad (SAW) and his family for our own good.      Consider someone who you don't know, not at all. One day he comes to you and says salaam to you. Second day he comes again and says salaam again. Third, fourth, fifth, Sixth day.... he continues to greet you while you two walk past one another in a fraction of a second. You wil very soon start considering him among one of your acquaintances if he keeps this practice up. You will be there to help him out if possible whenever he needs it. I know I would because he would

At some stage in the evolutionary history of humans, our ancestors would have stopped eating the placenta as this is a common practice for placental mammals but not humans. I don’t think there is any culture in the world that encourages humans to eat the placenta after birth, even though I just learned that some Asian countries have beauty products made from human placentas. Also, some cultures place a lot of spiritual significance on the placenta and have rituals and ceremonies… http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-birth...  But I was just wondering, since the bible is a pretty old book, does it mention anything about the human placenta and what the proper thing for a Christian to do with it is?

20090222120209AAKJSwr	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	So can someone explain this to me?	I constantly hear about how people who are "racist" need to travel and get more experience and learn different cultures and they wont be that way. Well the opposite happend to me, so I dont agree with that comment. My family was very racist and I could never figure out why.  I just knew I never wanted to be that way. I never had a dislike for anyone when I was a child, until I was about 20 years old.  I tried learning and speaking Spanish to the people that worked at hotels I traveled to with my family.  I always made friends with the black and asian people in my school.  I had friends of all races.  Now I wouldnt consider myself a racist person now, I just have more dislike for people after traveling.  For instance, I have seen what hispanics have done to parts of Southern Florida and it angered me.  The more I traveled the more dislike I got for certain people.  I still have friends of all races and colors but I still feel the way I do.  So I am well traveled, lived in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago and Orlando.  So I am very experienced, so why do you think that happend to me?

20090222111635AA2SdOh	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it wrong to refuse to pay service charge on principle?	I am hardly a tight tipper. When I feel the service deserves a tip, it's often more than the UK national average (about 10%). In groups of friends, I tend to pick up the difference between what I think the service deserves and what friends have collected - there have been times when I've tipped ￡5 and four or five friends have tipped ￡2 between them.      However, I think that a restaurant first assuming I want to pay their waiter something extra, then adding 10-15% to my bill - often only noted in small print - is insolent. Is it wrong to refuse to pay the service charge on principle?

This group never ceases to show their ignorance and hypocrisy.

20090222155546AADvcJk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If God is smart enough to give us the ten commandments, why didn't he clarify abortion for us?	Why didn't he clarify the right and wrongs of birth control, abortion, and condoms, because it sure is confusing the heck out of us.  If god is mad for our actions, then when I die I will be the first to ask, "How the heck was i suppose to know?"      P.S.  I am an atheist and I believe that aborting is wrong because as soon as someone's chances of living a life of happiness our created (conception)  then that person has the right to pursuit of happiness, (birth, and life)  So if your one of those people who say you couldn't take care of your child and abortion was your only choice,  then don't take the risk by having sex!  Unless you can take care of the baby.  And men, you need to take responsibility for your child!  You helped make it,  don't blame women for abortion.

Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 7, Book 70, Number 573:   Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:   When Allah's Apostle was on his death-bed and in the house there were some people among whom was 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet said, "Come, let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray." 'Umar said, "The Prophet is seriously ill and you have the Qur'an; so the Book of Allah is enough for us." The people present in the house differed and quarrelled. Some said "Go near so that the Prophet may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray," while the others said as Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before the Prophet, Allah's Apostle said, "Go away!" Narrated 'Ubaidullah: Ibn 'Abbas used to say, "It was very unfortunate that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.       http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...       Book 013, Number 4015:   Sa'id b. Jubair reported from Ibn Abbas that he said: Thursday, and what about Thursday? Then tears began to flow until I saw them on his cheeks as it they were the strings of pearls. He (the narrator) said that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Bring me a shoulder blade and ink-pot (or tablet and inkpot), so that I write for you a document (by following which) you would never go astray. They said: Allah's Messenger (may peace upon him) is in the state of unconsciousness.    http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...        http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...        http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...

Of the 124,000 Prophets' that Allah (swt) sent, what evidence is there that they left everything for their followers as Sadaqah (Charity)? If they did, then why did the Prophet (saaws)'s wives not give all their possessions to the Islamic State? After all, Ahl'ul Sunnah consider the wives to be Ahlul'bayt. Sadaqah is haram on the Ahlul'bayt, this being the case why did they hold on to their possessions?

Salaam'alaykum waRathmatullahi waBarakatuh      To my knowledge and in my opinion, Islam is a message to all of mankind~~in teaching all about Allah(SWT), our Creator. We, as Muslims should struggle against our own selfish desires, as everything is and should be for the sake of Allah(SWT). Islam defends the interest of all humanity~      And yet~~for a majority of the time here in ramadan section there is nothing but bickering between the sects of Islam~~tit for tat situations that do nothing except promote a more negative attitude in the minds of those who are already bent on bashing Islam!!!!!      Should we not be teaching those who do not know or understand the real message of Islam?      Is not ignorance the bane of the Muslim Ummah today?

The father works various odd jobs--working for a landscaper during the day and a pizzeria at night, and he has no health benefits.  They live in government subsidized housing, receive food stamps, receive government assistant to help with utilities, purchase used clothes at a thrift store, and take their kids to the inner city hospital emergency for free (taxpayer funded) routine medical care.  The entire family is obese from eating hamburger helper, McDonalds, and tons of cheap junk food.  They still manage to come up with the money for beer and cigarettes, satellite TV, and a car payment for a new car.      Are you okay with your tax dollars going to support and perpetuate this lifestyle?

My hobbie is the military, i've always loved it, but over the past couple of years, i don't think it makes me happy anymore. I don't know if it was the Iraq war or the massive explosion in anti-war protests, but it's become increasingly difficult to enjoy such a hobbie, without being hated by people, its even made me quite an enemy among some.      I do like to talk about what way and how we would strike say, North Korea and Iran, not that i'm supporting such things, just that because its my hobbie, i think its interesting about how we would do it. I support nuclear weapons and i understand the importance of nuclear deterrance, but this obviously brings me in direct confflict with a lot of people. I love spy novels and secret service stuff, and when people find out about that, they go ballistic saying "there were no WMD's!" almost threatening me, out of nowhere. I support our troops regardless of which war there in, yet out of nowhere i'm accussed of "wanting to bomb civilans! that i'm a murderer!" I supported "The Surge", why? well, military stuff is my hobbie, and i think about the best military way forward and i thought it was this, which turned out to be correct. Once when i was being heckled in a conversation about military stuff by an anti-war protester, i turned around to them and said, "Shut up! leave me alone, i'm not a murderer, i don't want to bomb civilans, and nar do our troops, they are not told to bomb civilans, and there isn't and never has been such an F'n plicy!" But almost immediatly after saying this, i'm accused of wanting to make love to George Bush, and i'm like "Eh! Where the hell is this coming from"    Your thoughts and views?

20090222141153AAq3tpU	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	8th grade gay marriage persuasive essay.. good?	After the legalizations in Massachusetts and, most recently, California, gay marriage has been a growing trend in the United States. In the 8 months since the legalization, more and more gay couples have been rushing to California to tie the knot. However, California and Massachusetts are not the first to make an effort to strengthen the bonds of homosexual couples some European countries including Denmark, Holland, some Scandinavian countries, and others have legalized same-sex marriage and have found the results positive. Gay marriage has been a contradictory issue since gay men and women began requesting marriage licenses. However, gays are denied their rights to marriage licenses, which is denying then their rights as American citizens. Gays should be treated equally to heterosexuals and granted their rights to marry the person they love, whether they are the same or opposite gender.     Although the idea of a same-sex wedding hasn’t been legal long enough for statistics to be developed on children of same-sex marriages’ developmental upbringing, or that they are harmed by their environment, many people seem to think that they will be less healthy or normal if the couple that raises them are homosexual. People believe that the children will grow up to be gay, or different from any normally raised child, if they don’t grow up in a “normal” family. The results of studies testing these ideas are quite contrary to the popular belief of heterosexual couples. In fact, the studies show that children raised by gay couples seem to be more adjusted than the “normally” raised ones. The argument that children raised in homosexual households will grow up to be gay is completely illegitimate. In a study of over 300 children of homosexual parents, there have been no indications that there are any disturbances in the development of the child’s sexual identity, or the lifestyle that the child will live later in life. In reality, most children raised by heterosexuals are not raised in normal households. With divorce also becoming popular we have families with three kids and only one parent. There is no doubt that homosexuals want to have children, and not only is the ban of gay marriage denying their rights to be married, but also denying them their rights to have a two-parent family with children. Some also say that marriage is between a man and a woman for procreation purposes, and that gays cannot naturally produce children. If this were the case then wouldn’t the state prohibit marriage between heterosexuals when one, or both, are sterile? If the purpose of marriage is, in fact, for procreation then who’s to say that post-menopausal women should have the right to marry? Children in foster care and orphanages are also a problem, so why not kill two birds with one stone and give gays their rights and orphans or unwanted children a home and a family that loves them?    Another argument against gay marriage is that it is against religion. Whose religion? Some religions, such as Buddhism, actually celebrate gay marriage. The fact that gay marriages are illegal goes against not only the gays’ rights, but their rights also. And the fact that people are bringing the bible into their arguments also means that other religions religious rights are being infringed. The bible has no standing in American law, this was made clear by the first amendment of the United States constitution, and no one has any right or authority to set rules based on something they take as a moral injunction stated by the bible. The Christian and catholic religions cannot speak for all religions, and the United Stated government is allowing them to do just that. The main purpose of our government is to preserve the rights of the citizens, and at this, our government has failed. Homosexuals are not the only people being denied their rights, but also the members of certain religions that support same-sex marriages. Along with this, people also say that gay marriage would force churches that have an objection to perform gay marriage to perform same-sex weddings. There is no law stating that any church would be required to marry any couple, heterosexual or otherwise, that they do not wish to. Gay marriage would not change the churches right to refuse to sanctify any marriage that they do not wish to. It would only give churches the opportunity to legally wed gay couples if they would like to.    None of the arguments above are valid. So now, let us examine the true reasons that people oppose the marriage of homosexual couples. Most people just are not comfortable with the idea. For years now, society has promoted the idea that two men or two women being married is wrong. This is mostly because of the arguments mentioned previously. However, none of those objections make sense! So neither does the idea that gay marriage is wrong. Being uncomfortable with a proposal is not a valid reason to oppose it. It is selfish to infringe other human beings’ rights for your

Back when I was younger, like everyone else I used terms like "that's gay"  or  "what a gay" to describe something/someone annoying, displeasing, etc despite the fact it/they were in no way connected to homosexuality. Now I've grown out of the childish view that there is something wrong with being gay, however I still find myself using these terms to describe these things out of habit, and on reflecting on saying feel guilty, as I'm effectively insulting homosexuals by drawing a comparison between them and what i'm describing.      so, my question is      how can i break the habit of using these terms to describe things I don't like?

20090222133957AAO4lAO	Society & Culture;Languages	Anyone translate this in english for me?	Post psucos dies Hercules ad oppidum. Stymphalum iter fecit; imperaverat enim ei Eurystheus ut aves Stymphalides interficeret. Hae aves rostra aenea habebant, et carne hominum vescebantur. Ille postquam ad locum pervenit, lacum vidit; in hoc autem lacu, qui non procul erat ab oppido, aves habitabant. Nulla tamen appropinquandi facultas dabatur; lacus enim non ex aqua, sed e limo constitit. Hercules igitur neque pedibus neque lintre progredi potuit. *** magnam partem diei frustra consumpsissit, hoc conatu destitit et ad Minervam se contulit, ut auxilium ab ea peteret. Illa ei crotala dedit quae ipse Volcanus (qui ab fabris maxime colebatur) ex aere fecerat. *** Hercules his crotalis crepitum acerrimum fecisset, aves perterritae avolaverunt. Ille autem, dum avolant, magnum numerum earum sagittis transfixit.

20090222141128AAs1n6s	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Your opinion of my grocery store problem would be greatly appreciated; please tell me what to do.....?	My sister and I like to go grocery shopping on weekend mornings. She is handicapped and I have noticed that one of the kids that take the baskets from the parking lot has looked at her and laughed about her. This has happened a few times within the last few months. My sister is a very intelligent person who has a good job but she lives with this very serious handicap. Last week I contacted a man in the district office. I spoke to him on the phone, but never did get his last name or his title. He seemed very sympathetic and angry about this and promised me that he would speak with this kid and it would never happen again. Well, it happened yesterday morning when we came out of the store. I was amazed and shocked because it was obvious that this kid was never spoken to about this.  I described this kid as best as I could since I do not know his name. Looking back on it now, it did not seem as if the man in the district office was taking down his description very well.  I don't know where to go from here.  Shall I contact this same man again or try to find out who his boss is.  Please do not tell me to shop in another store as this would only be running away from the problem.  Please give me your opinion as to why this is still happening and what I should do.  Thank you.
