mKVFIklaaa	Both of the previous answers are incorrect, and you are right: Too low an engine temperature can cause premature wear.  First, run the car from cold for five minutes only & check if water's circulating through the radiator - if it is, then your thermostat is faulty and needs replacement.  If not, then the thermostat's still probably faulty, but just opening too soon - I think the usual temperature should be around 85-95 degrees celcius.  Finally, be aware that it may be the temperature sender faulty: The only real way to check is to use a test rig with the temperature sender suspended in a flask of hot water in the engine bay, checking the temperature gauge against a thermometer.|`|AA11900069	What he said!

3ljjKpCDaa	To be honest, I would stick to a diesel, as there is a great difference between and LPG and a Diesel. LPG vans/cars are often far more expensive than the average petrol/diesel car, but they will pay for themselves in a few years, due to the lower costs of fuel. Another problem with LPG cars/vans is that many fuel stations do NOT sell LPG, as it is not a fuel that is used by the majority, only by the minority. A diesel car/van is much cheaper, it may have a higher running cost, but I would still go for it, with my experience as a mechanic, I have seen far more LPG cars come in for repairs than diesels. You are paying less for quality, rather than more for quantity (higher MPG).|`|cK35Umeeaa	Unless you live or work near a supply of LPG, stick to diesel.  If you do, dual fuel.|`|PyZbYO0gaa	bio fuel is the new thing i would recommend sticking to your car cause by 2012 gas price will be $10-$18 very high people might not even use cars anymore but did you heard about the mayan calender ending in 2012 that fricken scary it like when sun  turns mad then we all die but i dont noe yet lets just see.|`|mKVFIklaaa	The problem is here that fuel prices are an unknown quantity: The government agreed not to raise duty on LPG as a vehicle fuel when it was first sold, but that agreement has now lapsed, they could decide to up the duty on LPG tomorrow to match that on petrol or diesel. However, there doesn't seem to be any signs of this happening in the imediate future.  Assuming the duty on LPG doesn't change, LPG is your best bet - just check availability locally.  If you're buying new, biodiesel is out of the question - you'll immediately invalidate your manufacturer's warranty. The reason for this is that you'd be using fuel of unknown quality, as opposed to standardised forecourt fuel. You can check with your vehicle maker, I guarantee they'll tell you the same.  The alternative is to buy a three or four year old vehicle & run on 50% diesel & 50% unused vegetable oil (straight off the supermarket shelf) - or have a used vehicle converted to use biodiesel - again, getting this can be a problem & usually involves a 'two tank' system, where you have to switch between fuels in the vehicle.  Email me if you need any further info.|`|Gjxnve6uaa	LPG no good for you do you know how much space it takes up?  LPG prices set to rocket any way    go diesel and use bio fuel|`|z8m4eEJxaa	you will get more milage with a diesel car but it is geting very expensive in price. also the diesel motor is alot more reliable. if u get a car thats made for lpg from factory thats the way to go as well. but if you convert it you will have alot of problems in the long run such as head gaskets and change of gas bottles every so many years. id stick with the diesel van unless you but a brand new stright lpg from factory. you will also get more milage if its from factory than converted later on. hope this helped.|`|AA11900069	Run your diesel on processed cooking-oil, it is waaaaayy cheaper|`|GEBTQCTBaa	Best advice I can give you is to stick with diesel.  You can then fita two tank system and run it on new vegetable oil at 90per litre (currently).  If you do the conversion yourself then the kit costs around 600.  If you get a mechanic to do it it will cost around 1,300.  if you want to use waste vegeable oil then you need to be careful, a kit for cleaning it will cost around 600 but then your cost per litre drops with every litre that you recycle.  If you want more info then e-mail me.

I pretty much started out with the old 80's 5 series BMW which was a 2.8 and handled like a dog on lino. That series of the car was the one which started all the "it'll kill you it doesn't handle we're all going to die!" stuff. By the time the newer 5 and then your E30 came along everything was very well sorted. Let's face it, it's not going to be a rocket ship either, with that 1.6 motor kicking out less than 100 bhp even in top tune, so you won't be tail sliding around Tesco, supposing you CAN insure it. Not without booting the life out of it, that is. Don't get me wrong here, I think it's an excellent first car - and whatever car you get you're going to drive sensibly and live..... right?

Companies usually make front wheel drive vehicles as they are cheaper and easier to produce. Unless you are planning at cutting through corners at 40 mph, a RWD car is not necessarily dangerous. I wrecked a FWD 2004 Accord because I was an inexperienced driver and caught some understeer going into a turn. Front wheel drive can be really dangerous in some situations. Also owned a RWD BMW 528e and I remember it handled like a dream. Happy driving.|`|I1HVIGUhaa	the e30 on the road is fine, if you're not a yob. they don't have too much power, but that being said, if you're dumb, like with any other car, they will bite you. I've owned several, and they've all been SO much fun. I raced them as well, and it was like an elephant on ice skates. They don't handle that well out of the box, but with weight reduction, suspension and body stiffening, and a hefty dose of extra power, they're pretty entertaining. They're a perfectly fine first car. they're fun to drive, and you won't break the bank if you wreck it doing something foolish. They're fun, no worries. Get one and you'll be hooked.

AA12102248	Depends on the people putting the exhaust together, if it's a simple huge rear box attached to a good system, then it will be fine. If someone has put a big bore all the way through, the likely hood is that there will be not enough back pressure, so at low revs it will be down on power, but at the top end it might be slightly better (might). Big bore is not usually a good way to go as most road engines aren't designed to run with little back pressure, so performance will drop as will fuel economy, all you will get is lots of noise and less oomph. |`|mKVFIklaaa	It's not that simple: Exhaust design is very complicated, and most modern engines require a degree of back pressure to function correctly.  It isn't a matter of extracting exhaust gases quickly, as without remapping injection systems, it normally results in a drop in power.  As an illustration, try running a car with no exhaust at all - if the first answer was correct, that would produce the best performance.  Doesn't go very well, does it?|`|AA12121752	No - a free-er flowing unit will boost performance - just if you start with a gutless engine you will just have a slightly less gutless engine.  |`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	No, larger exhaust will not take away any power, even on a stock "crappy boy racer ". Increasing exhaust pipe diameter from the header back, or at least the cat back, will generally increase HP, especially on a modified engine. Getting rid of exhaust gases faster improves performance.|`|AA11900069	As well as considering bore, there is an ideal 'tuned-length' for an exhaust - vary much from this and power and torque will suffer.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	On it's own, yes it would take away some power to balance it out you would also need to change the air filter (to let more air in!). You would also have to adjust (remap) the cars engine management system & tune the engine correctly. Only after all that is done will you see an increase in power (as well as noise!).

If there IS a mid-range driver, then another 'cross-over' capacitor of a different value of mH (milli-Humphrys') is used to leave the mid-range part of the signal with the mid-range driver, and send the high treble notes to the tweeter.       If you have bought good quality 6x9's, they will have these in the speakers already.

jh0iGkdeaa	1. Buy a car that is tested in real life situations to have a small CO2 emissions, for instance, Top Gear tested the Toyota Prius and a BMW M3. The M3 had a smaller amount of CO2 emission.    2. Don't put the air conditioning on. It uses more fuel, unless you are doing more than 50. If you have the aircon on under 50 it uses more fuel than if you have the windows open, however if you have the windows open above 50 it reduces the aerodynamics of the car and so therefore uses more fuel, so ti is more efficient to have the aircon on.    3. Drive in lower gears and change gears earlier, that way less fuel i used reving the car    4. Make sure the car is balanced properly    5. Make sure the wheels are pumped up at the correct pressure.    6.Carry as little weight as possible. Just imagine you are Lewis Hamilton and you have just lost last weeks race because Massa is a ****. Imagine you have to beat him,  so to get the best speed, you need less weight. Get in that frame of mind and loose some weight.    7. Don't drive fast. It wastes more fuel and is illegal above 70.    8.

Old ones, properly maintained, can produce less CO2 and pollution.      It is pointless anyway.  China had bicycles ten years ago.  It is getting scooters now, smelly, fumey scooters, that turn the air black.  It is also starting to get cars.  And about fifteen years from now will have a couple of hundred million cars in use.

Drive within the cars and you own limits .    |`|jOljnsulaa	When accelerating, do so slowly.  Change up the gears at low revs instead of flooring the throttle.    When braking, don't get to your destination then slam on the brakes, take your foor of the accelerator and let the speed bleed off, changing down the gears as needed which is also aid braking because the engine will do the braking for you.    Keep your tyre pressures at their correct, manufacturer recommended levels.    Don't always fill the car up with petrol each time.  All that extra weight to carry around means extra fuel to reach the speeds you're after as well as extra braking needed to slow you down.    The car has a optimum speed which you should try to keep to where possible.  A test in Europe where top speeds are higher shows that increasing your speed from 70mph to 80mph increases fuel use by 8%!|`|6f7687e3ebb22b17ddcc35392ca6fd7eaa	Environmental impact.............????

So if you want to reduce the 'environmental impact' of your car - plant more trees. Trees like Co2, it helps them to grow and flourish - and plants in general will all absorb Co2 from the atmosphere.

Go for the quickest, easiest route.  Find a door the same colour in a breakers yard.   Many yards have a list of all the cars and colours on a computer, so you can start by phoning them, and they should tell you "Yes, we have two blue ones" or "We have a silver and a red one".  They may not be able to tell you the EXACT shade of paint, and your car may have been available in pale blue, medium and dark blue, for instance.        Unless they supply you with the key, you will need to get your own door lock fitted, and of course, your own cars' interior door trim.  Make sure the glass is tinted the same shade!  If you have green tints, and the door has brown or grey, you can have your own glass moved over into the new one.         It can be very cost-effective to simply change the door, and could be a done-deal inside of an hour, rather than you putting the car in for paint.  |`|qOR2nxd0aa	you will have to get rid of the rust and respray the area. go to an auto parts shop and get some rust converter which reacts with the rust to stop it getting worse .if it is bad you may have to use body filler and buy a can of touch up paint. you can get D.I.Y sheets which should help|`|yFMv9VNEaa	Agree with the door replacement, easier than treating.

AA11900069	The garage should have checked the head for flatness, and if it needed it, sent it for skimming, which costs around 30 to 40 pounds for a four cylinder head.       What caused the original fail?  36,000 should be nothing to an engine!  Was it driver error in running with not enough coolant, or did a hose or the radiator fail?  Maybe the fan didn't kick in?

You are at university, yet you haven't got your head around the BASIC fact that you MUST to be insured FOR THE CAR that you are driving, EVERY TIME you get behind the wheel.       How would you have compensated the owner of a valuable car, say a 70,000 pound new Mercedes, if you had hit it?   Let alone if you had injured someone in an accident.           You CAN get insurance which allows you Third Party cover in any car, but that is the privilege of experienced drivers, with full no-claims-discount, and an excellent relationship with their insurer.

And don't make that same mistake again!  |`|n4tFjt90aa	You don't say where you are but most of your answers seem to be UK based. If your in UK it seems you got good advice from them.     If your in USA - This is what I would do.    A. You said you have car insurance on your car that you drive, just not insured as a driver on uncle's car. If this is true (you own a car and have car insurance in your name on that car) you can fight the points, by providing proof of insurance at the time of the incident via your own personal car insurance.  Generally most US policies, cover you as a driver while driving someone else's vehicle. So technically you did have insurance at the time.    B. If you get a letter from state or court regarding the driving without insurance - get a copy of your dec page from your personal car insurance, and take it to court with you to show the judge that you were covered by your own personal car insurance at the time while driving uncle's car.  This rule may vary state to state, but its a general rule of thumb.    C. Check with agent/company to verify that you are covered by your policy while driving another vehicle.  "Hi Agent Jane, Im going to be visiting family over the weekend, and I was wondering if I happen to use Uncle Bob's car while Im there, will my car insurance cover me while I am driving his car"  Agent Jane will look up your policy and say Yes or No. Most likely her answer will be yes. Unless you live in some weird state or have a very specific policy.    D. If you do "not" own a car of your own, but drive regularly, you can take out a policy called a "non-owner's"policy. Basically this is for people who do regularly drive, but do not own a car to take out auto insurance. Depending on your age, and MVR, it could be as little as $300/year and up. The non-owner policy will cover you in any car you drive no matter who it belongs too, as long as your policy is paid and current.

You could probably also drop a V4 Corsair/Transit engine in if you could find one, but it'd be pretty pointless as they weren't much cop. Look at a later Sierra DOHC injection engine or better still a Zetec. There's more work involved (especially with the Zetec) but infinitely worth the effort. Don't forget to upgrade the brakes and suspension too.  For a better idea try visiting somewhere like Retro-Rides ( http://retrorides.proboards86.com/index.... ) for inspiration and help/ideas as there's a few Cortina owners on there, most with brilliantly modified examples.
kUdGfQzxaa	In term of reliability, i will go for 2003 Audi S8|`|O9SfLmgqaa	wow, two ends of the spectrum but for me, no question the audi would be my choice. The boxster is really small and you can really throw it around but unless it's the "S" version, is actually underpowered. Build quality and materials are top shelf. Probably can't drive it year round, unless you live in So Cal or Fl. Two seater, not even sure a set of golf clubs will fit. did I mention how small it is ?    The Audi for a large car drives a lot smaller than it's size thanks to alum panels etc. IF you like gadgets, look no further . It has the 330hp (360hp?) v8 which is a marvel and would walk away from the boxter with four adults AND golf clubs on the road. It's a low number production car so not every tom, dick and harry are driving them. Build quality is even better than the Porsche. Both cars are expensive to repair. The S8 was probably over $80k out the door and someone else has taken the depreciation.

What are you talking about?    Spark-plugs?  Follow the leads from the distributor to the plugs in each of the cylinders, and using the right tool, (the spark-plug wrench appropriate for that plug) slowly, carefully remove them.  Only do them one at a time, or you could confuse the HT leads that you take off the engine, which is not a good thing to do!       Using a feeler gauge, check and if you need to, adjust, the spark-plug gap for the new plugs.  Clean the throat around the hole with a rag, and put a tiny drop of oil on the threads of the new plug before fitting it.  Do not over-tighten it!  Best use a torque wrench set to the correct value from your car handbook.  Replace lead, and do the next one.      Look at the plugs you remove.  They tell you a lot about the engine condition.  Check the widely-published chart of photos of spark plugs (it should be in your handbook or manual) to see what the plugs are saying about the engine.  In short, they should not be burnt out, oily, or cracked.  A light biscuit colour is ideal.       Please explain what Welsh plugs are, if they aren't spark-plugs!

Prius''s and pedestrians come together very often!|`|AA10613104	I love the prius to use as an example of deceptive marketing playing on the "GREEN".  They are slow, dont handle great, and are expensive to repair due to the use of braking power to generate electricity.  The prius should be applauded for their innovations, however, the prius is the most "un-green" vehicle mass produced.  The reason is parts are manufactured in many countries, then shipped, and assembled in another before being re-sold in yet another.  The carbon footprint of manufacturing is estimated at 3 times that of a regular car.  Also, the batteries, like all batteries contain led and mercury, which pose a massive threat to the enviroment if not correctly and expensively disposed of.  I remember reading one well acredited article which actually credited the hummer of leaving less carbon footprint throughout average expected lifespans.  There are cars which are cheaper and greener to produce, which actually yeild more mpg.  The VW Rabbit p/u's from the early 80's got 50mpg in the deisel version, mind you this was 25 years ago using archaic technology compared to hybrids.  It is a scam.|`|GDxXxh46aa	Being energy conscious is VERY AMERICAN.  You are thinking of many generations of American's yet to come. Every gallon of gas we save now is a gallon for your great-grandkids.  Believe me, they are not making anymore oil, we can only search and drill for this limited resource. We don't want to be known as the generation that used up all the oil.  I have read estimates that the world has 70 years left of oil.  If we all drove a Hybrid it could be hundreds of years more oil.    Don't stop with the Prius, go all out, insulate your house, buy compact florescent bulbs for all fixtures, install low flow 1.6 gpf toilets, and 1gpm faucet aerators, turn down your thermostat, carpool, be creative.    I had a Cadillac (supposedly a very American auto that averaged 15 mpg or less) I parked it and got a Prius Feb 2008.  I love every inch of that Prius and haven't driven the Cadillac since.  Average 50+ mpg when I drive 50 to 55 mph, and I average 42 to 45 mpg when I drive 75 mph or more.  It is not slow, remember it has two engines and they both kick in when needed.  It can easily do 100 (not that I would ever do that). It has tons of room and handles extremely well.    There are many negative rumors about the Prius. Don't believe any of them. They are typical Internet propaganda. We all need to, and will be driving Hybrids in the next 5 to 10 years until some other technology that is better takes over.  When GM, Ford, & Chrysler can match the Prius for mpg and quality, I will get one of those.  |`|zp1q4AWNaa	NOOO!|`|iEXAhnAQaa	why would it make you not a good american|`|k8lYHG2Taa	definately.  prius' are the worst excuse for a car that exists.

So while the Prius costs marginally more to produce that most vehicles because of its battery, you easily make up for it in the energy and pollution you save driving the car. See cited source for detail.    Besides, you appear to have bought the car used (you're keeping a produced car in service) and Toyota recycles the Prius batteries, which very seldom need replacing in the real world (even in cases of Prius Taxis, which logged over 200,000 miles on a single battery).    As to whether or not you're a good American, look at it this way. If you bought an "American" Hummer (which was probably assembled in Mexico with parts imported from China), then look at your estimated fuel savings over a period of time adjusted for expected inflation (from cited article):    5 Years  $14,540  Gas up to $7/gal  10 Years  $43,785  Gas up to $14/gal  15 Years  $102,608  Gas up to $28/gal    That's a lot of coin that's not going into oil sheiks' pockets by not buying American. More than the cost of the Hummer, in fact!    It's like the bumper stickers say: "My Prius Starves Terrorists". What's more American than that?|`|mji0BxJjaa	don't worry about it, that green stuff is so stupid

g5M9Vhlnaa	Wow, "insomniac" must be my clone.  Can't agree more.  I'll NEVER buy a new car.  It just doesn't make any sense.  A car is just a means to get from point A to point B.  Like "insomniac", I also drive old Mercedes cars.  My 24-year-old Mercedes 300SD diesel has almost 658,000 miles on it, and I'm still driving it 5 days a week.  I have no desire whatsoever to own a new car.  What I have does the job it was made for, and that's alright by me.    I also have a 1983 Mercedes 240D, which I bought 10 years ago for $2200 cash, with 245K miles, and if I sold it today, I could still sell it for that same price.  It now has 368K miles.  Why buy a new car when something old and reliable will do the same job?      Again, referring back to "insomniac", there's no need to risk your credit, buying a new car, being stuck with car payments, and running the risk of something happening (job loss, freak accident resulting in medical bills, etc.), when you can save your money for a few weeks, and pay cash for a cheap, old car.    I would give anything to be your age again, knowing what I know now.  I used to have a desire for nice, big, fancy, expensive high-class cars, and I wasted a lot of money on them.  Today, I have nothing to show for all those dollars I squandered when I was younger.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	The local Hyundai dealer is selling brand new 2007 models for 50% of MSRP.  Get one of those..|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello    The first thing to remember is if you buy brand new from dealership the car will loose 4K-7K plus, depending on what you buy as soon as your name goes on the Log Book.  This is because with another name on the Log Book it can only be sold as 2nd hand, even with 0 or delivery mileage only.  If you are talking that new look for one like that yourself as it will include warranties and not require a MOT for 3 years from date of registration.  Most people working at a dealership will be a sales person so you can go and ask.    Remember if you go for Hire Purchase work out  (take a calculator with you) the total amount to be repaid  Typical is for a 10k car is 19K.  Worked out at  316  for 5 years. ( 316 X 60 months = 1896) and this amount will be paid even if you try to pay off early and the interest will be paid first so after the 29th  month you will start to pay for the car.  However if you find one that has a higher deposit but o% interest like I did when I bought my bike (HONDA U.K) were doing a 0% but had to be paid in 10 months,  That was years ago though.  So look around, ask questions and work out total repayment amounts.    Andy C |`|a5D9QTo3aa	Depends what you can afford if you can afford monthly payments of 2-300$ go for it talk to a sales person but if at any time you are unsure stop. Dont let them talk you into a quick sale. The way salesmen make money is selling cars they will say anything they can to get you into a car. Even if they dont think you can make the payments.|`|A0thHwpbaa	Unless you are able to pay the full price in cash, you are probably going to need a co-signer for a loan; that is, the person who will take over the payments if you default. Will your parents be willing to co-sign?     As for talking to the salesman at the dealership, just remember, he wants your money and will say just about anything to get it. Test drive different models if you are looking for new cars (again, you may need your parent there) and don't make any snap decisions. Always think it over, overnight. The car will be there then next day, believe me.     The best thing you can do is check out Consumer Reports.com. It costs $5 a month and it will give you invaluable information about new and used cars and their repair records.

Do you want to work to pay loans on a car, or work to OWN a house, which is rising in value?  |`|jFrzBCeuaa	It will never hurt to ask. I just bought a Jeep off a dealer lot and my payment is only $198. My dad did co-sign for be in order to get a great interest rate. I did my research though! A lot of car lots will not carry anything less than $10,000. I searched on the internet to find what good lots carried a car that I wanted in my price range. I also called my credit union to see what the rates were (I already had a loan with them so they game a specific rate but they can give you a ball park). The dealer will try to give you some outragiously high rate at first.  Buying a car can really help built your credit for when you do buy a house in the future. I think it is a very good idea. I  do advise that you sell your car first. I made the mistake of thinking my car would sell fast... I have been stuck with 2 payment for 2 months. 
AA11900069	I have heard about these from a break-down truck guy, who says they call it the "Engine F****d Light", as if you see it, that is pretty much what you are looking at.        Make sure your coolant system has good hoses, the right mix of water:anti-freeze, a fresh thermostat (that won't stick in the "shut" position causing an over-heat) every three years, and go remove the leads on your electrical fan connections, clean them up, and grease them.  Critical overheats very commonly happen from the electric fan not kicking-in when it should, due to corrosion on these terminals, or from a thermostat which is stuck-shut.          If you are changing your coolant (every three years at most) take the time to flush the entire coolant system with a hose, for a good hour, to remove silt from the radiator.  Keep the cabin heater controls in the 'ON' position whilst you do all this.  |`|de292ad47a31aedcb683cf279d2cb997aa	If it has a temperature lamp it can work in one of two ways.    1.

sgYkoEjcaa	If the clutch uses a manual adjustable cable, set it so the clutch and brake pedals are around the same height. You'll see 2 locknuts on the cable at the gearbox end, one 10mm and the other 13mm.    If the cable uses a self adjusting mechanism this can be identified by crawling under the car (on stands or ramps) and you'll see a thick plastic section on the cable clipped to the subframe in the centre of the car just forward of the steering rack.     The chances are if this has gradually got worse the cable has probably stretched or the self adjust mechanism (if it has one) has gone wrong.    The only other problem these cars suffer from is the splines on the gearbox input shaft corrode if not greased and the clutch disc will stick leading to the same gearchange faults.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	well on a Nissan forum I can say your clutch is not releasing either because the hydraulic parts are leaking or if cable operated it is not adjusted properly|`|AA11900069	Is it the cable, or is it a hydraulic system?

23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	The engine speed varies according to the load that it put on it. When idling from cold the engine's fuel/air mix is normally much richer than it is at normal operating temperature - hence the faster speed.     When you switch on the electrical accessories you are putting a greater load on the alternator.   The electrical load (measured in watts) means the alternator has to have mechanical power (horsepower) delivered to it, this creates more drag on the engine and so it slows down.   The system in your car is incapable of detecting the extra demand on the engine so it cannot compensate by speeding it up. The only way that can happen is when you put your foot down.    Your car must be old technology if it has an automatic choke. Modern vehicles with fuel injection do not have carburettors so they don't have a choke.   The engine management system used on fuel injection engines (based on a small computer) regulates the fuel/air mixture to take into account the engine load, air temperature and driver's demands. It does this by very precisely controlling the amount of petrol that is injected rather than by the much cruder method of controlling the air, which is what a choke did.   This means that the variation in engine speed of a modern EMS engine is a lot less than that of older ones.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	    Your first response was right on from Gingerann.  If I can, let me try to explain it     to you in a somewhat different way.     When you wake up in the morning, don't you need a few minutes      to get yourself going to a faster speed. If I woke you right out of      sleep and asked you to make coffee,  cook breakfast, wash the      dishes from the night before, and brush your teeth at the same      time, you would probably attempt to do this but once you realized      how overwhelming it was, you would slow down on one or more     of your events... Well, the car feels the same way....It's ready to     get rolling right off the start, but once you hit it with all of those     needs, it begins to slow down to adjust to the demand.     Now if you want, you could always buy a $ 200.00  battery and     a high output alternator or, just give it a moment to warm up with     what it has as original equipment. Give it a few minutes before you     hit it with all these demands and I assure you , your components     will last longer.       Just my two cents here.|`|AA11900069	Your car doesn't have a huge reserve of capacity...  I have cars which have large alternators, which carry a lot of muscle, so when you put the heated rear window on, the headlights, and use the electric windows, they just don't affect the revs of the engine.

Also, the engine will rev less when an electrical item is turned on because you are drawing power away from the system.

If they have to stay outside, I always make sure the block heater is plugged in. Most of the time, I'll park them in the garage, that way the interior stays warm too. A warmer diesel engine is a lot easier to start because diesels rely on compression alone to run and diesel fuel burns easier when it is warm. Glow plugs are not plugged in at all, they are activated when the ignition is turned to the "on" position.

Il s'agit d'une installation qui fonctionne selon le principe du va et vient. Bien s?r nous pouvons y transporter de la marchandise ou des passagers. Mais quand l'on parle du tlphrique qui transporte des voyageurs, il faut remonter en 1908. Le premier a t construit en Suisse par Feldman. C'tait un appareil trs audacieux : le tlphrique  voyageurs du Wetterhorn sans pyl?nes de ligne et avec une pente impressionnante. Malheureusement, l'insuccs conomique et la premire guerre mondiale ont conduit  l'abandon complet du projet.

You will come across something or other that you will then be able to pay cash for, and call it your own and not be beholden to anybody (especially parents).  Then you can start spending the $300 each month on insurance and fuel.  But, ultimately it is up to you.  We have all been in position where the money is burning hole in our pockets, and want to jump at the opportunity.    Personally, my first self-bought car was an old beat up, dented, rusted pontiac that had an old tired engine in it.  I bought it (20 years ago) as car  2, just so that I could learn to work on cars.  My other car was a 280Zx turbo, computer controlled, and very little I could do.  While I was learning to rebuilt motor, transmission, and differential (cone type posi screws suck!), I learned that my old hoopty was in fact a 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge.

crNMC0BDaa	Se a seguradora do veculo causador do acidente for acionada, ela arcar com os prejuzos causados ao seu veculo, sem nenhum custo adicional para voc, contudo, para que isso aconte?a, no B.O tem que estar bem caracterizado que a culpabilidade do acidente foi do outro veculo, preferencialmente que ele mesmo fa?a a ocorrncia polcial.    Para os danos totais no seu veculo:  No seguro de veculos, existe uma cobertura de RCF-V, que cobre danos contra terceiros. A seguradora s responde pelos danos pacificamente se o segurado assumir a responsabilidade pelo acidente, caso contrrio, ela poder se negar ao pagamento, baseada no contrato.    Quanto aos danos a objetos no interior do veculo:  Objetos fixos como som e caixas tem fcil comprova??o de que os danos decorreram do acidente, logo, passveis tambm de ressarcimento.   Objetos diversos, mesmo danificados, s?o passveis de anlise de nexo causal e bem mais difcil de ressarcimento dos prejuzos, dada a dificuldade em comprovar que os danos realmente foram causados pelo impacto do veculo.  Isso voc provavelmente n?o v receber.    No caso do prejuzo do seu carro ser absorvido pela seguradora do veculo causador do acidente atravs da cobertura de RCF-V, n?o h nenhum pagamento pra ser feito por voc. A franquia n?o se aplica nesse caso.     N?o se preocupe com rela??o  seguradora querer fugir  responsabilidade. Seus direitos est?o assegurados, se e somente se, o causador do acidente assumir a culpa e preencher tambm um aviso de sinistro do carro dele, contando como foi o ocorrido e deixando bem claro que ele foi o culpado. Se a descri??o que ele fizer do acidente for vaga sem configurar a culpabilidade, neste caso tambm a seguradora pode se omitir ao pagamento.    Por enquanto, providencie os avisos de sinistros, que podem ser feitos online (depende da seguradora) ou v diretamente  sucursal da mesma (depende da cidade em que voc se encontre).

Se o antigo era 175/70, eu colocaria um 175/60 r14 para ficar numa medida semelhante. N?o estou fazendo nenhum clculo, apenas dando uma sugest?o de cabe?a.  Mas, se voc quiser calcular certinho, considere que:    no caso do seu pneu atual, 175  a largura da banda de rodagem, no caso 175mm, ou 17,5cm. o 70 em seguida  a porcentagem da altura em rela??o a banda de rodagem. Ou seja, desses 175mm, a altura tem 70% dela. Ou seja, +- 122mm de altura da roda  banda de rodagem. A, se voc considerar a distancia do centro da roda at o pneu e, dessa divisa at a banda de rodagem (esses 122cm que citei) voc pode ter uma medida mais precisa de que pneu usar.  Fa?a a medi??o de quantos CM v?o do centro da roda 13 at a divisa com o pneu, e em seguida, voc soma isso com a altura obtida da porcentagem da banda de rodagem. Ent?o voc ter a altura total do seu conjunto "roda/pneu". Feito isso,  s medir do centro da roda 14 at a divisa com o pneu e ver quanto falta pra igualar  medida da "roda/pneu" da roda 13. A vai ser a medida do pneu que voce precisa, lembrando que a banda de rodagem deve ser a MESMA. Ou seja, voc ter que conseguir um pneu 175, com uma porcentagem proporcional ao que falta para a altura se igualar  do conjunto 13... Eu CHUTO que o 60 sirva, que daria mais ou menos 105mm, talvez o 65 com 113mm... Um dos dois, NUNCA o 70 pois a roda 14  maior, consequentemente ficar mais alto. E, tambm n?o mude a largura do pneu pois isso tambm influi um pouco no jeito do carro andar, ok?    Espero ter ajudado!    []s!|`|n0RZXzSCaa	O que o colega BOSS.302 falou sobre a dimens?o do pneu est certissimo.     Com rela??o a modifica??o da velocidade realmente altera, pois quanto mais voce aumentar o diametro do pneu mais veloz ir andar e consequentemente seu velocimetro ir marcar uma diferen?a de velocidade entre a real e a marcada no velocimetro menor. Por exemplo, se com o pneu que est usando est marcando uma velocidade de 60 Km/h e na realidade voce est a 54 Km/h, quando aumentar os pneus essa diferen?a vai diminuir.    Com rela??o ao consumo, o aumento  mais significativo quando voce aumenta a banda de rolagem. Por exemplo, tira o seu pneu 175/70 e coloca um pneu 205/50.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	175  a medida da largura do pneu.  70  a altura em rela??o ao solo.

O esquema a seguir  o seguinte: alinhe o pist?o da frente (o mais prximo de quem abre a tampa do motor), em sua subida mxima, com o cachimbo do distribuidor apontado para a vela correspondente a esse pist?o. Preste aten??o em uma coisa: esse pist?o poder estar prestes a receber a centelha da vela (este  o ponto que buscamos) ou ir recuar para a admiss?o de combustvel (este ponto n?o nos interessa). No primeiro caso haver uma vlvula se abrindo (admiss?o) e no segundo ambas estar?o fechadas (explos?o). Ent?o, isso ir depender da posi??o em que est?o as vlvulas.    Desta forma, alinhe a polia das vlvulas, de sorte que as vlvulas deste cilindro estejam ambas fechadas. Nesse ponto, geralmente existem marca??es nas pe?as do motor, como na polia das vlvulas e no virabrequim, aproveite dessas marca??es para manter esses pontos o mais alinhados possvel com alguma marca??o do corpo do motor (nessa posi??o fica mais evidente que uma risca de uma polia deve se sincronizar com marquinhas da carca?a do motor, mantenha-as alinhadas). Depois de colocada a correia,  necessrio um ajuste de ponto usando-se uma luz estroboscpica e girando-se o distribuidor.|`|0WLj6OKsaa	O palio 98 utiliza ferramentas especiais para sincronizar o virabrequim (1 ferramenta), o comando (1ferramenta) e tensionar a correia (1 ferramenta).

Sem as ferramentas e se arriscando a tentar pelo mtodo prtico j mencionado por outro colega,  fria.

GDUOJQeMaa	Audi owns Lamborghini but they're still making they're own cars in Italy although Gallardo shares parts with R8.|`|d0B3geJNaa	audi owns lamborghini, and audi is owned by vw. but all three are very different. they dont use the same parts like company's like GM and Ford.|`|cpQU51teaa	they're made in Italy as always, though they incorporate many designs, technologies from audi|`|qxTXr4Gxaa	VW owns Lamborghini, Audi, Seat, Skoda, and Bentley|`|kOCtAVXwaa	VW Audi Porsche Lamborghini.     Look at my user name, as it will tell you my specialty.    Audi builds the Lamborghini now.  They purchased it from almost running out of business, for a very small amount around 5-10 years ago.  Something in the range of less than 50 million, which is cheap.    They than redesigned the whole vehicle line-up.  Out with the countach and diablo, and in with the murcielago and gallardo.  They use a similar drivetrain to the Audi R8, in which the gearbox sits ahead of the engine, and drives power off a transfer case to the rear.  The output on the front goes directly to the front differential.    Ever since Audi took over, the quality and build really made Lamborghini a "drivers" car.  Comforts and all...    The engine used in the gallardo is a similar engine block to the Audi S8.  I believe with the displacement on the Lambo actually being a bit smaller.      VW will eventually take over the world, since they build better cars than everyone else.  Porsche has VW parts and symbols all over them, and I could care less, since the quality is perfect on all the cars, VW or Lamborghini.    Now that is the best answer.  Any questions on these, please email me.|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	Yes have you just noticed that now? The Lamborghini Gallardo has the same look inside as the Audi R8. Here's a link.

nAzbLdBCaa	There are several ships in trials or limited duty.  The Surface Effects ships use an airfoil type hull between two hulls.  Catamaran style.  There are three HSV ships that are relatively small 300+ ft. These are also catamaran style the can run for 4 hours at near 55 MPH and cruise at 35MPH for 5000 + miles. the surface effects ships are larger , but slower.   EDIT....... Hover Craft are relatively small, and sit low to the water, they all have a flexible "skirt' that  skims over the water and holds the air, which is generated by large fans, in so that it "lifts" the boat,  which is then relatively fast, but doesn't fit your discription......

Yes one needs to be confident, but also mature enough to take constructive criticism and apply it.  One also studies as much as possible about one's weapon system, opposing weapons systems and ways to defeat them.  The overachiever part comes from:  A- being selected for an officer training program. About 1 in 3 of applicants are outright rejected.  Getting past this hurdle then  B- being selected for pilot training.  1 in 5-6 applicants don't even get selected to go.  Once there you're facing  C- extensive competition for a very few fighter positions.  Normally out of a class of 30-40 students MAYBE 3-4 fighter platforms come down.  Standards are EXTREMELY high:  if you aren't clearly crushing your academics and flying evals-you will NOT get a fighter.  This is also on top of a very demanding program with a 30-40% washout rate.  At this point, you've devoted anywhere from 2 (OTS-SUPT) to 5 (ROTC/Academy-SUPT) to just getting to a fighter.|`|mR5ZtjqWaa	if they live to an old age, then yes, overachievers.  why?  they're flying against other good pilots.

BgwTxzEFaa	Well, you should contact your insurance company and notify them (dont file a claim until you have an estimate, just let them know you were in an accident and MIGHT file a claim)..  You should then bring your car to a shop and get it checked out for an estimate (and piece of mind).  You will have a deductible, and sometimes, the deductible is higher than the repairs.  So, get the estimate, and if it is more than your deductible file the claim with your insurance company.    You will pay the deductible, the insurance will pay the difference.      Your insurance company will handle dealing with his insurance company.    However, if the pain persists, or gets worse, you should contact an attorney.|`|PFa39j3Uaa	As long as there was an accident report filed by the police stating you weren't at fault, the driver at fault is responsible for repairs to your car.

I've been rear-ended twice and it's not fun.  Hope everything works out for you.|`|l1dAq3pOaa	Above all things, DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING!  1. Get an attorney.  2. Go to a doctor.  3.

8RrNrjFPaa	talk to someone who specializes in off-road gear, they will know where to get one, and body lifts are great they are easy to do and cheaper than suspension lifts, also suspension lifts often blow out c/v joints, which gets very expensive. Also body lifts are great for offroading.  The most important thing in offroading is axle clearance, you only get that by putting on bigger tires. A suspension lift will not help any more than a suspension lift. Believe me I have plenty of experience of roading, I have done more things in my stock Montero and lifted Tacoma, than many people have done in there lifted trucks/suvs. I have gone through 4' deep saltwater creeks, mudpuddles that I couldn't measure the depth, and done rock crawling, on inclines that some rockcrawlers wouldn't brave.|`|2fedb93811e7991f74469d7c9556b4c6aa	dont get a body lift there dumb does nothing to susupenion so , get a suspension lift there 1000x better then a body lift unles your not goin to take it off road then get a body lift but then there would be no point putting taller tires on just for street and no offroading.|`|04928c1724d54ac70cc015c3d16566baaa	go to a hardware store and buy a solid oak 2'' diameter dowel, buy a 2" pvc pipe.  put the dowel inside the pvc pipe, cut the length for whatever height you want to raise it to.  Drill a 7/16" hole through the center of the dowell, return to the hardware store and buy nuts and bolts long enough to go through everything plus about 2".  Remove the original bolts, one at a time, jack the body off the frame until the spacers you made will fit between the body and frame. stick the bolt through then let the jack down.  Be careful buying the bolts, make sure you get the good strong ones.  Also the bolts are probably of different lengths. Also be aware of the different lengths for your steering shaft and clutch linkage.  You've just saved youself about $1,000.00 dollars.
TJ1HMKL1aa	i would turn the eq on the amp little lower than middle 3/4 up on gain and bass boost 3/4 should slam but not too sure on the eq every amps different so just till it sounds right but boost and gain will be fine at 3/4 no higher maybe a little on boost|`|dRozk0cCaa	i usually start of from the amp than to the headunit

I'd look at the linkage if your sure about how to start it.  Maybe a cable got lose.
AA11151305	As long as exhaust gas is being formed, the turbo will spool and create boost, with or without an intake system.  Most race cars delete the intake and run straight turbo inlet.    Chances are, since you removed the factory piping you also removed your factory sensors that control your fuel flow and air ratio.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	A close friend had a similar problem with a Rover 75 - someone jumped on the roof -  and to replace the sunroof (it was damaged inside as well as on top) cost au$3100.00    They are not inexpensive to repair. Maybe you should consider trying a breakers/wrecking yard to find one.|`|4biGrjPkaa	Theres a structural opinion that once the roof gets kinked the car is an automatic write off, especially amongst insurers/insurance approved repair centres.     But if you know anyone who is handy with a drill and a spot welder, you should be able to repair this fairly cheaply.     Find the same model (same colour if poss) in a breakers yard.    purchase 1 x roof (just cut it off at the pillars)    drill out the spot welds    remove roof skin.    carefully remove roof skin from your car  (you need to remove the front and back screen)    spot weld new roof in place    paint.    Sounds easy doesnt it? No it isn't! But it can be done, all in for around 300 if you have the right tools and expertise.    Personally I think the garage were right, to pay someone to do it would be worth more than the car, but if you can do it yourself its worth having a go.    Top of range Rover 45 2.0 V6 Connoisseur Steptronic 4dr  2000 (W ) with 80,000 miles is worth 1000, so I doubt spending any more than 500 would be classed as an economical repair.    hope this helps|`|BTGaBAS4aa	About 300or 400 this is a rough estimate as i have not seen the damage.you could try paintless dent removal a good pdr man should be able to help you.

You should replace it soon as you can as it will seriously affect the tire wear on the wheel with the broken shock.|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	Yes, Yes and yes. The shocks dampen the force of bumps, which are substantial to a heavy vehicle.

Get it fixed to be on the safe side.|`|5XS8KvUxaa	For s short period of time it wont be to much damage. But over a long time it wiil wear your tires horribly. So for a short time 1 or 2 months no bigy after tht you could be doing some damage HOPE I HELPED|`|1YE6qIdkaa	It is important to replace. A bad shock can be a safety issue if let go for too long. The initial problems you will have as it loses it's ability to function properly is a rougher or bouncier ride. This is the result of the tire bouncing which in turn causes irregular tire wear and loss of tire contact with the ground. The car may become unstable as a result of the tire losing contact with the road which may result in an accident. I would recommend having a reputable shop inspect them and give you an estimate. I would replace it if it is bad as soon as possible.

u0PHhZOSaa	depending on where you live, both atvs specially blasters and dirt bikes are fun. but if you live where its cold like Maine i would go for the blaster, easer to drive in snow and safer but if you live in a state where it nice year round like Florida then choose what you like.

That being said, if you are close to the age for you to start driving, it think its very responsible to be thinking about getting a car. And if you have 2grand saved up, major kudos to you! I purchased a 91 accord with under 50,000 mi for around that price from a little old lady that took wonderful care of it. I love my Honda! I went from a 2004 grand am that blew a head gasket (which I am still paying on!) to this and I am never looking back! My next car will surely be a Honda too!     1. >$30 to fill up my tank (which goes over 400 mi on full)   2. Cheaper maintenance (an much less needed than american cars, parts last longer...)  3. Very reliable  4. The older the car, the cheaper the insurance (only spending 2K on the car means you wont have yo worry about comprehensive coverage)  + I think its a cost effective car for a young student such as yourself.    I bought my own car to lean on as well (my mom had a HUGE van) it worked out well, I think. Plus statistically, you'll probably end up crashing it anyway. Even if you don't get this car stick to a cheap (Non-American car) just something that gets the job done is all you need for your first auto.
N2RUBUEjaa	I'm 16 and also getting my car soon, but my dad also says he can't get an expensive car.

I suggest a '90 or so Chevy S-10 or Ford Ranger, you can toss all sorts of stuff in the bed (including your tuba), have fire painted on the fenders, chrome tail-pipe tip, and a squirrel tail on the radio antenna and not lose too much when you wreck it. If you live long enough to make it through high school, maybe then dad will buy you a newer vehicle.|`|X6C6kZKKaa	honda accord coupe 08-09. a friend had one they are good on gas and almost never break down. good choice. also depends on how good you take care of it. and maintain.|`|77UuUUrcaa	if you pack alot of equipment for band and soccer i wouldnt recommend a civic since they're rather small, go with a bigger car... the scion tc although is a good car is also very small... so depending on how much you need to carry around may depend on what car you want to get - be careful with the audi's (i own one) because their turbo engine likes to eat up oil ... i would go with a honda accord or a lancer

gKRLXuXvaa	Its not the timing belt. The 4 cylinder 2.3L engine has a chain belt for the timing. That is more than likely the belt that drives the alternator, the AC unit. If its squeaking or making noise, you can always tighten it, or maybe its old and you need a new one. If you have 25k miles on it, you probably need a new one. The cold makes everything contract so it loosens the belt a bit. good luck|`|ZvAenLOMaa	its your timing belt.  and you could have an oil leak, the oil leaking is drying the belt and its making a loud squeak noise. once it heats up does it go away?  or is it continous? it could be that its cracked and it just needs to be replaced, but its a lot more common when you just changed your oil and you spilled some on the belt, oil leak or other scenarios.    you might wanna change that belt, it shouldnt be too expensive, make sure you dont have a leak though.    good luck

There is NEVER any reason to sacrifice your daugther's school work.  If she needs to be punished for inappropriate behaviour you take away a social aspect of her life, like X-box or her cell phone or ground her from going out with her friends.

6lpwsY9kaa	As a proud Trans Am owner, there a couple of modifications i would make.    As far as the interior goes, i would definatly add some led's and stuff for lighting purposes. The color is up to you to choose, depending on the color of the car.     An example can be found here...    http://www.car-neons.co.uk/neonpik.jpg    I would also definatly put in a good audio system. JL Audio for subs (would definatly have to have at least two 12") and Premier for the head unit...amps would be your choice.    As far as the body of the car goes, i would definatly look for a WS-6 hood...    As far as the paint goes, ive always been a fan of black. On this year, DONT EVEN consider putting on the firebird emblam in the paint scheme. That logo/decal is more or less meant for the 70's and 80's models.    If you go with the black color, definatly tint the windows. It gives it a kind of stealth look.    As far as rims goes, any size will do but they would have to be black and look somewhat to this...    http://www.allfordmustangs.com/forums/at...      Dont do any neon on the outside though...    As far as mufflers go, definatly do Flowmax...    You mainly dont want to alter the outside of the car too much because the firebirds, trans ams and camaros have a look all their own.    It all depends on how much you are willing to put into the car...    Hope this helps...

If it's a Formula or Trans-Am, upgrade the engine to LT4 standards via head/cam/intake swap. I would consider 17 or 18 inch wheels, a true dual exhaust, and maybe some stiffer springs and shocks. For the interior, just some white faced gauges and an upgraded stereo if your car doesn't have the Monsoon factory system. Please refrain from any wings or tacky body kits.

I am sure he would charge you a small fee - I charge between $300-1000 depending on the price of the car.

However, in order to attend an auction you must possess a valid dealer's license.  Otherwise, you can't even get in.  A private dealer's license stipulates that you must buy and sell at least six cars a year, and there's a fee to get one.  If you're just looking to buy one car, your best bet might be to ask your friend's dad if you can go along the next time he goes to an auction and offer him the price of the car plus a little extra for his help.  That way you don't have to go through the process of getting a license.|`|sCLqPSUfaa	Most decent auctions are dealer only auctions.    There are some auctions that are open to the public but honestly, if you dont not know what you are doing, you might not be getting the "deal" you think you are.    You might just be getting an education instead.    If you dont know cars, auctions, auctioneers and sellers  you might just be buying yourself some trouble.    That said, you could get some decent deals even if you dont know about all of the above. The less you know, the greater the chance that you will pay more than you should or buy something with problems you didnt know about.    Look at it like a gamble because in some ways, thats exactly what it is.    Ask yourself...why is the seller willing to sell that car for that price ?  He got it for a good bit less, or it has problems he doesnt want to deal with.|`|jWAqoO7uaa	Hi,Compcrasher86    There is a website for Government & Police Auction Cars and   You can get a Free Step-by-Step Auction Guide there.

You might want to take this class during cooler weather because they have you ride with full protective gear. I had a friend do it in the summer & she nearly passed out from the heat, gloves, jacket, etc.    I don't know your size build so it's hard to say what you can handle.|`|2fedb93811e7991f74469d7c9556b4c6aa	just go get your permit and learn on your own|`|klLrz7Mlaa	this is amazing  http://www.real-wishes.com|`|OLkdquXAaa	yeah... i can ride that and im 13.. been riding since 4 though so idk..|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Get your priorites straight.  1 Lwearn to ride, you've done most of that,  2: but and register abike, @@ 6"3 you're plenty big enogh for a 600 if not to big.

zlPAVkUBaa	If you have the defroster on, the A/C is running, so there will be water from condensation dripping out where you would normally see water in the summertime form the A/C running.    The car is 28 years old, it is probably tired, so there will be smoke, especially on startup.     Keep driving it.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Is the puddle of water you saw clear water?  If it is, then maybe it is from the air conditioning/heater use which is normal.  If it is coolant, then there is a leak somewhere.  It is also normal for cars to steam from the exhaust when first started, especially if it is cold outside.  Check to make sure the fluids are all full, and keep an eye on it.  If they stay full, you have nothing to worry about.    Cheers

aDcor92Maa	Itn would depend how much you are willing to spend. The best subwoofer ive seen was the JL audio 12w7     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078ffTYmz...    But this list i made might help you.   ======================================...  Good brands, including but not limited to: Alpine, Rockford Fosgate, Kicker, JL Audio, Soundstream, ARC Audio, Cadence, Diamond Audio, Focal, Dayton (subs), Precision Power, some MTX, Pioneer Premier; old school brands: Lanzar, Hifonics, and Phoenix Gold.    Mediocre brands (brands that are good for the money, but there is better): Quantum Audio, Sony ES line, Memphis, JBL (in my opinion), Pioneer, Kenwood.    Generic brands, not limited to, but including Pyramid, Boss, Lanzar (except old school Lanzars), HiFonics (again except old school, series VIII and earlier), Legacy, American Pro, Powerbass, MA Audio, Dual, Lightning Audio, Visionik, Volfenhag, Jensen, American Legacy, Audiobahn, Sony Explod line, VR3, JVC, Pyle. Any thing at Wal-Mart, or an auto parts store.  ======================================...    If you are looking to save money, go with brands that are in the mediocre area, such as Memphis Audio.|`|dRozk0cCaa	alpine, kicker, mtx    check out circuit right now they're going out of business and they got amps and subwoofers 40 % off so you'll get great brands for cheap over there. for your car i would go with the L5 enclosure with kicker 500.1 amp with a 4 gauge amp kit and if you have a stock radio you'll need rca converters or if you have an aftermarket radio don't worry about the converter|`|Srs4Oalfaa	pioneer premier 12's are super loud for the price... look for them on ebay tsw1207d2 or tsw3001d2|`|JqVK95MWaa	Your best bet is to go to a car audio shop and look around before you buy. Ask questions right now do to the slow economy you can get good deals on car stereo systems.PLus usually comes with free installation.You can get a deck or car indash stereo like alpine or kenwood with the same component subs you should only need one sub like a ten inch sub.Also you are going to have to replace your stock speakers.with separate tweeters and mids.All that said now you need something to push the sound out to make it sound loud or to your taste.This are called sound amplifiers.Normally the hole system sound best when its all one brand like all alpine or all kenwood or all pioneer,blaupunkd,clarion,jvc etc,etc.All these should run you about $500 or less stick with this price theres alot unscrupulus sales guys that will want to sell you something you dont need.if they say it cant be done go to the next car audio place.depending where you live at in california like los angeles and bakersfield you can go to car audion pros this guys can give you a good deal for  about $250 but you need to look around and negociate with people. good luck

R1vZHRIDaa	Obtain as many secondary qualifications as you possibly can as secondary school is compulsory and so are the subjects your school does. While you are still at secondary school it is best and most advisable that you begin flying lessons in order to obtain your PPL license. This is the very first license you should obtain and after gaining your PPL you should continue to gain many other licenses and ratings:   Private Pilot License.  Instrument Rating;  Commercial License;  Multi-Engine license/add-on;  Certified Flight Instructor (CFI);  Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII);  Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI);  Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI).  There are quite a lot widely available. The first one you will do, PPL, you can start the lessons at a minimum age 14 years old, go solo at a minimum age 16 years old and obtain license at 17 years old. From there your instructor can advise you what to do next and from then on.  After secondary school, go on to tertiary education (Known as A-level in the UK, short for Additional Level). You can choose 4 or 5 courses to take for one year. For the second and final year you will drop one course. Preferably you want to be looking at taking Mathematics, Physics, A Language and a subject you enjoy. (If youre doing 5 subjects which is very rare choose something else useful e.g. Geography, Engineering or most of all English).  For the second year as I stated you drop one subject. It is very advised that you drop the subject you enjoy as the other subjects are your main priorities. If you gain all of these then move onto university, choose any course you like, preferably the course that you are best at as airlines don't mind which degree you have as long as you have one (However it is sometimes possible to become a pilot without a degree but is unlikely). Remember that during all these stages and levels of education continue with your flying and gaining more ratings and try to log as many hours as you possibly can. This is very important when it comes to decision time.   Airlines say that a degree isnt required, which is partly true but the competition is extremely high and candidates with a degree are head and shoulders above the candidates who dont have a degree. For university it is best that you choose to do a 4-year degree of the subject that you excel at the most. So, the subject you get best at A-Level, carry it on to degree level as airlines don't mind which degree you have obtained but as long as you have one (although a degree isn't a necessity). Or you could do a combinational degree as I did; I did Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics and Spanish at A-Level and carried Mathematics and Spanish on to degree level. The choice is yours on which subject to do.  Also, if you really want to become a pilot then you will be a better candidate if you have logged hours in a light aircraft. It is advisable that you log a bare minimum of 600 hours but really try to excel that target.  So, while youre still at secondary school I suggest you begin taking flying lessons to obtain a PPL (Private Pilot License). Minimum ages are:  Begin lessons: 14  Go solo: 16  Obtain license: 17  Once you have obtained this you should log as many hours as you possibly can before entering university as you will be struggling financially unless youre rich.  So by the age of 22 you could have all your GCSE's, 4 A/S levels. 3 A levels, a degree and a PPL license.  With this you are an almost perfect candidate and stand an extremely strong chance of becoming a pilot. This is the way I did it so I like to think it would help other people as well.    For training for a PPL on a Cessna 150M here are the costs:  45 hours flying C150 - 5,175  Landing fees (estimate) - 300  Training items - 175  Annual membership varies for each school but mine is 99.50  Radio-telephony test fee - 55  Total - 5,804    GROUND STUDIES:  Ground school (when required) 25 per hour  Written exams - 30 each  IMC test - 65  Radiotelephony test - 65  PPL skill test - 130  Class 2 medical examination - 140    If you want to do it in a better plane such as a Tobago TB10 then add 21 for every hour you take.    Self hire for these aircraft are approximately 95 per hour including landing fee    Class 1 Medical examination  Study books (7 books at approx $30 each)  Instrument Rating  Radiotelephony equipment and test fee  Landing fees (varies on size of airport)  Ground studies and tuition  Written examination fee  PPL Skill test  IMC test  The only clothing you need is a highly visible vest (bright green or yellow)  Membership  Total cost approx 5500  I apologize that I dont know which country your from so I cant exchange the prices myself.  The prices vary with which aircraft you learn in.|`|0Th3lvynaa	If you do your training in a regular flight school and not in college then it will cost you about $30,000+.  Once you get done with all your rating you should start flight instructing to build your hours and make some cash.  You will have to build quite a few hours before the airlines hire you.  I remember that in 2007 some airlines started hiring pilots with 250 hours total time.  But now there are so many pilots out there without jobs that the airline minimums went way up.  It will get better eventually.|`|hPFRNbW7aa	That guy above me is crazy, you want to be a pilot? your going to be poor your whole life... id say upwards of 60,000 and 10 years to pay it off.....its not going to happen....Join the marines!|`|RskPXtibaa	pilotguy u really discouraged that guy  think the positive side not the negative side    u can spend frm 30000 to 80000 USD

Here's my top 3:    1. 1984-1986 Mustang SVO          - This has got to be one of the most fun cars I've ever driven. It's got a 2.3T in it with a 5-speed. With a few simple mods (boost controller, air filter, exhaust, front mount intercooler, etc.) these cars don't have too much trouble taking on a New Edge GT. The Mustang SVO is one of the best handling Mustangs off all time, it's also quicker in than a 5.0 and can still get 25 mpg.    2. New Edge (1999-2004) GT         - You can find one for around $7k, but it might have some pretty high miles. For this you can do a CAI (cold air intake), exhaust, tuner, and some gears.    3. 1987-1993 Mustang GT (5.0)         - These cars are pretty quick from the factory, and the 5.0 is an amazing motor with plenty of potential. The mods for this are pretty much the same as the New Edge GT. Once you get more money you can start going into do heads, cam, etc.    I would stay away from the SN-95 (1994-1998) GT's as their heads/cam/intake are really holding their performance back. They aren't that fast, and IMO they don't look as good as a clean Fox Body or New Edge. I'm not sure about the 5.0 that was in the early SN-95's though.     And to Steve H, before you recommend a Camaro, learn how to spell it right.

One reason may be due to how the display works.  There are different ways that caps are made to turn on and off the voltmeter on the cap.  Some of them include only turning on if there is a major change in voltage and another that is turning off when the voltage is too low.      What is the display reading when the display is on, what voltage is it reading?  Also, what model cap are you using?    The cap will be working fine it is simply the display that may be malfunctioning or turning off.

wqeAeSVYaa	There is usually a jack insertion divot in the rail that runs just inside of the rocker panel.  It is often behind the front wheel or in front of the back wheel.  You can look for a picture in your owners manual.  This part of the rocker is a structural part that can support the weight of the vehicle while you are jacking up the car, however it is usually mean for the factory jack in your trunk.      When using a floor jack, I usually get a spare piece of wood and wedge it between the floor jack and the rocker so that the jack doesn't end up damaging the car.    Then you can raise the car slowly making sure that it is stable.  If you jack the car in the wrong place such as the rocker molding, or the floor board, you will run the risk of damaging your car, as neither of these places can support the weight of you car.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Juat isiode the body rail is a pad lower than the res tof the body, behind the front wheel,in front of the rear, some have marks, or a slot in the body seam, Nascar race cars weigh and measure the center balance point to pick up both wheels at once.

I would check it out mechanically tho first, ask for log books, how often they changed the oil etc.    If it all looks good I would definitely buy it!    I'd make an offer a little less than 2,000 tho.|`|c7YlgvD5aa	ep    Not a bad deal,but that's a lot of miles and could breakdown on the way home. You really need to have it checked out by transmission mechanic and have a compression check done on the motor. I don't know what you want to use it for but you do not want to drive to fast or use the passing gear very much at all. If you do it will die on you and you will have lost your money. so don't be in a hurry and if the mechanics give a sort of thumbs up, It will be a good deal.

2bqmotqlaa	you have a real problem   dont stall it because you are hurting the engine badly  unplug it from the battery and it does not do harm to the motor|`|WM1Umaysaa	stall it|`|QxJVD1Flaa	More info please. you try to turn off ignition keys and it's still working. Is it still running right now?     Disconnecting the batterry won't shut the motor off.    Stalling the motor (if you have manual tranny won't harm the engine) people stall all the time.    I would reccomend you disconnecting spark plugs (careful! they may shock, but it's not going to hurt you) try using rubber gloves.

One guy even installed stick on Ford emblems and chrome trim strips over EVERY SQUARE INCH OF HIS TRUCK!!, no lie, not to mention the add on running lights on the step bars and the windshield visor and cab louvers, it is laughably hideous.  He paints the undercarriage and brake drums and rotors with silver spray paint.  He loves it though, different strokes for different folks.  It really is up to you.

XQvWjkrSaa	Basically, these are the steps most follow.  Of course it completely depends on the condition of your truck.  How dirty it is, are there light swirls, heavy scratches, oxidation, etc.  These all will contribute to what processes and chemicals you will need to utilize.    Step 1 - Wash (use a grit guard [http://www.detailinggurus.com/grit_guard...  Step 2 - Clay Bar (This is to remove all the bonded contaminants)  Step 3 - 1 or 2 stage polishing (If there are heavier defects like scratches, swirls or oxidation, you'll need a 2 stage polishing system.  SYSTEM ONE X3 is a great kit to start with)  Step 4 - Wash again (This removes all the polishing oils and dust that sometimes results from polishing)  Step 5 - Wax or Seal (http://www.detailinggurus.com/waxes-seal...

1YE6qIdkaa	Your best hope is to check the transmission fluid. If you're low on trans fluid it won't be pretty. See, your transmission is one big hunk of hydraulic machinery, and that fluid is not only there to lubricate the gears but some of it is also there for the hydraulics to kick gears up or down. With low fluid it may not be making the switch completely. If your tran fluid is low i would sincerely recommend finding different transportation to get more fluid. And the tran fluid may be low due to a leak. so if it is get it looked at. And if its full, you may have a bad fluid pump. either way, don't drive it for anything until you figure this out or you will be further down the hole. Good Luck!!!|`|AA10160243	Have you checked the transmission fluid?|`|2x5t9c82aa	I sorry it sound the tranmission a new tranmission cost for this car between $2,500 to $3,900 good luck|`|aBCm5bwHaa	try turning overdrive off, the button right under the rear defroster.

Slamming into gear from neutral isn't good for the transmission. If thats the only way you can do a burnout, then you shouldn't be doing them in your car.    Get yourself a RWD, so you can do real burnouts.|`|qjg0g5WMaa	well if you do there is the very real possibility that you could destroy the trans or drive axle if your trying to spin the tires why? but heres how rwd hold brake apply throttle til rear tire spins release as you want leave fwd set parking brake apply throttle but you wont be cool and you'll just tear your car up|`|BgwTxzEFaa	If you neutral drop your transmission at high enough RPM's to engage a burnout you are likely to severely damage your transmission and/or torque converter.    Just engage your ebrake and go for the gold.    If your car does not have enough horsepower to burn the tires without dropping the tranny, you really should not be attempting burnouts in it.|`|uomYVsiLaa	rwd or fwd?

Im pretty sure that its 2400 peak power, but if it is 2400 watts rms you want an amp that can put out a little more than that. If i was you i would look into getting an amp that can put out around 2500watts.|`|jfGeecrqaa	Dont listen to those answers. The best amp you can have for that sub is the JL 1000/1. Trust me, i had the exact same setup and it sounded great. If you dont believe me go ask your near by audio shop and the will tell you. Plus you know its good quality because it is made by JL. I think you could get it for about $250 online now because they have been out for about 2 years but it is still known as the best jl amp made. They used to be about a $1000 when itforst came out.

If ur bike hasnt been used much then all you need to do is ride it more and it should start up easier after you do about 50 hours because thats the same with most other bikes. Oh yea and dont rev it hard if it hasnt been ridden much just cruise around because the engine needs to wear itself in. I think its called "breaking it in" or something. If ur still having problems then just go see ur local dealer/maitenence place    good luck|`|R3Xh3NN7aa	...I think... you have to ride it more often so that it's used to starting and running.  Or because it's winter its just to cold to start. Next winter you should winterize the engine.  And you need to let it warm up before you put it into gear.   Hope this helps!!|`|4PTHcwb7aa	The engine might not be recieving fuel. Try changing the fuel filter. Then when you give it gas, the engine should run.

The questions that popped into my mind while reading your question had to do with what type of material the body parts of your Peugeot auto are made of and what type of finish was *originally* placed on its exterior to give it a *bright & shiny WHITE* colour.  Also, you state that the vehicle has a Diesel engine that powers it. O-o-e-e-u! Several years of operation under the "rather dirty" handling of Diesel fuel and exhaust heavy particles, *I* should think would *Jolly Well* tend to *SET a Dirtying-UP!" into the exterior of your *ORIGINALLY PURE--WHITE* vehicle.    Please don't be angry with me. I told you at the beginning that I didn't feel that *I* could give you any good advice from *my* quarter. But I *DO* wish you the *Best of Luck* in finding the right person (on your Island}) who can and *does* help you.  "Cheerio, Old Chap! Pip, pip!!|`|jxqNTr9Iaa	You can bring the colour back to a deep shine by getting it buffed by a professional valeter,this could cost upto 100 normally.    You could do the work yourself with t-cut,polish and wax and one hell of a lot of elbow grease and time.    Well I havent got any links to hand but ebay is a good place to start.    To spice it up,if you mean performancewise then increasing the fuel pressure to feed in more diesel.Lookswise then you can never go wrong with alloys and lowering it|`|vZMN82U8aa	well i admire your intentions, and yet i have to ask, surely you can find something better, like a 205gti to spend money on.    the diesel is and economy drive, its get up and go has gone. no street cred in 1.9litre diesels... street cred starts at 6 litres...     to paint it, youre looking atthe wrong side of 500 quid, you can probably find the plastics on ebay... and really speaking, you cant tweak the old diesel... its a slug. im sorry, but my wifes got one. its dissapointing.. and im afriad a total waste of time effort and money.     flog it, youll get a few hundred quid, at 60plus MPG you might get 350, then go buy something with a petrol engine.. and some style. like a golf, or a mk1 fiesta...|`|nRzNSAu2aa	in regards to the paint work you can either get it polished for about 60 or go for a repaint which will be anywhere from 1500 upwards. (more than the car is worth!)  as for getting modified bits try ebay, scrappys etc but every time you buy a bit you'll have to get it painted, to be honest you might as well leave it, money for old rope and all that...unless your loaded...but then you would have got a new car!
fKVF8fufaa	Well the next thing you have to do is check for spark. Just unhook the plug wire and stick in a spare (known to be good) plug. You could lay the plug on the engine to ground it, but, I believe that engine is painted, so, you may have to use a jumper wire to ground the plug . Crank it over and check for spark (best done in dim light), if there is no spark at least you will be on the right track, if there is spark you'll have to look elsewhere.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	How old is the bike and how old is the gas that was in it?  When you say you "cleaned the carbs" did you buy a carb kit to rebuild the carbs or did you mearly get a new gasket for the bowls?      When you took the spark plugs out, did the plugs appear wet or were they dry?  If dry the bike is not getting fuel or enough fuel mix.  If wet it is getting too much.    Did you at any time reset the floats or drop a float when you were cleaning the carbs.  Did you make sure you put every jet back exactly where it came from and snug them down?|`|1q6dsHRRaa	check for spark, then pray|`|yDK2vi1Daa	think you should also check if your cdi if its still working or not.coz even your battery are good it wont start|`|2FT7sVkbaa	when was the last time you checked the air filter?  when was the last time you cleaned the filter screen located inside the petcock of the gas tank?  when was the last time you checked the tightness of intake clamps?  what about the choke?   is it working?  you have a problem where the bike is starving for fuel, check the simple things first BEFORE you tear apart the carb.

But that is called power-braking, the burnout comes after you let off of the brake and leave tire marks. This is best if done after the tires start smoking, and always do it when people are around they love it. Especially the cops.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	Trade it in for a Caprice.

Mustang,Firebird,Camaro,Charger,Challe... etc,etc.    The trouble is that American cars are heavy with large cast iron V8 engines.Their suspension technology is not just dated but agricultural,usually consisting of rear leaf springs and live axles.They are great for drag racing but not good for rallying !!!    Why do you think the tend to use Japanese cars a lot for drifting !!!    Eurpoean and Japanese cars are much nore suited to drifting because by the very nature of the road network in Europe which tends to have been based on original ancient roads and consists of a lot of corners while in Japan,a small Island like the UK again the roads are narrow and twisty.Whereas the U.S has a lot of long straight wide highways.    Due to this road difference that U.S and Euro/Japanese cars tend to differ aswell.American cars having big unstressed V8 engines and automatic gearbox and expected to drive long distances on straight roads the aren't over concerned with handling and road holding whereas Euro/Japanese cars would be used for much shorter distances,on twistier roads and therefore have much more capacity for road holding,handling,cornering and general controlability.    Everyone knows about what sort of Jap car is good for drifting so I'd suggest something like a Ford Cortina/Capri/Granada would be smart though a Sierra would be even better.That or either an Opel Manta/Ascona or a BMW 5 series !!!|`|7L0zp7O6aa	It's a misconception that you need lots of power to drift.

fDDgFrtNaa	ok, so im assuming your truck is diesel if it has glowplugs. it has to be wildly cold for diesel to turn into gell. it may be the glowplugs..but im sort of doubtful because in extremely cold climates on diesels if you cranked the starter long enough(provided that it didnt burn up the starter or run the battery down) it would eventually heat the engine enough to make it turn over. it actually sounds as if your truck is having fuel pump issues. hope this helps u out. good luck|`|AA10562288	Where are you , what is the temp,is the truck diesel or gas ??

It saves on gas too, as you mentioned.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	No detrimental effects what so ever. Don't use when on slippery roads.

BgwTxzEFaa	Wheel Speed sensors at the wheels are for your ABS system, they monitor the revolution speeds of the wheel in relation to each other to check for loss of traction or skidding.  You will also have a sensor in the transmission that monitors the actual vehicle speed based on the RPM of the output shaft.|`|efa550f6673c521a6c47e67cc5153a8eaa	your car uses the vehicle speed sensor to determine the speed to display on the speedometer, it also uses it to determine vehicle speed versus wheel speed for the abs system, it also uses it as an input for the vsc traction control system. sounds like the vehicle speed sensor, which is usually located in the transmission housing near one of the output shafts has stopped working, it is basically a magnet that reads a tone ring causing an electrical pulse to the computer system of the car, it is also possible there is a broken wire involved.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Only one speed sensor is going to operate the speedometer - the other is for VSS or Antilock input - the dealer should know which one it is.|`|bvCkplELaa	Yeah the dealer is correct, two different sensors unrelated, what is your question?

It's not rear wheel drive, rear engine mount (manual transmission in your case), large displacement, or turbo'd. If you wanted it to be faster, you can make it faster. You won't find many vehicles that are fast from the factory these days unless you're dropping more than $70+K. If you want it, get it. The TC is a great looking car, economical and reliable (it is a Toyota after all) if you want to make it fast, you can do that too.  Don't let the haters get you down.    Cheers,  Ryan|`|BzRsPE4daa	a yahoo news article lists the scion tc  2 in the top 10 list of cars most likely to get you a speeding ticket. another reason why the insurance is higher on these than most cars.     don't lose sight of why you are buying a car or what you really need it for. the scion tc is a sporty car which has realistic everyday applications like driving to work safely. the automatic will sacrifice some of the punch but you'll still have enough power to pass and zip around on curvy back roads.     if people criticize the tc for not being a porsche than perhaps they should buy a porsche and keep quiet. secondly why does anyone need to go more than 120mph to get to work? keep the racing on the racetrack and help make it safe for those of us who are trying to drive responsibly.|`|Wb1Kwm99aa	It has a four cylinder naturally aspirated motor and its front wheel drive so yes it is pretty slow. I mean its not god awful slow.. It's quick not fast.     It is however a good starter car. You don't need a car that can go super fast, chances are you'd end up wrecking it. Get some experience first. Then move up to bigger and better things.|`|76c5c9015d959c8f878032174e785a4daa	Hey there,  No it is not. It is fairly quick to do 0 - 60 in 7.5 seconds with Manual Trans, and around 8 seconds with Auto. I own one and I think its quicker than my cousins 2001 Mazda Millennia S (2.3l V6 Supercharged). Its very reliable and reasonable on gas too. My average is around 29mpg with mix driving and speed averaging 65 mph. It sure is slow as compare to Mustang, Charger, and Subaru WRX STI but much faster and quicker than a Corolla, Civic (non SI), Mazda 3i, and costs around the same, actually cheaper than comparably equipped Civic. Hope this helps.
efqHlwyoaa	Unless you knew the owner, you know all the quirks and problems with that car, I'd generally advise staying away from a car with that many miles.    Cars nowadays can easily run 200K, but a poorly maintained can run into serious problems with less than 100K.    If you are not one to tinker with cars, you should stay away from cars that have that many miles.    130K is not a lot, but even well-taken care of cars are prone to run into problems with such high miles.|`|AtAAKDJUaa	as long as it's been taken care of, no.|`|G58hgBvEaa	Yes, anything over 100,000 is a lot for any car. Things wear out and down and it gets harder to keep in tact.|`|HVKfuhp3aa	It matters how well you keep up with the car. If you take care of it well (change oil, clean it up, etc.) it should run for quite a bit. It also depends on what type of car you have. If you want to sell the car, though, it may not look too good. It doesn't mean you'll get a bad price, just not as good.|`|QB03VABIaa	depends on what kind of car it is and how it was taken care of|`|LamVaAETaa	Depends.|`|AA12081834	Depends on the year, make and model...if regular maintenance  was performed...if buying or selling...what period of time the 130K was put on the car..the driving conditions..etc.etc.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	It depends on the car and how it was maintained    Ay!|`|3Q9HcfQsaa	not too bad|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	It would depend on how the engine was taken care of.

MV3tba21aa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - carquotes.sinfree.net|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Most of them have been driven hard, not-so-well maintained, and are mostly junk. That's not to say, with a lot of looking, you can find one in good shape but they were never good reliable, quality cars to begin with, and so your chances are slim. If you find one you like, I suggest that you get a qualified mechanic to look it over thoroughly BEFORE you buy. Also get a Carfax history report.|`|y93R1Na1aa	If it has a V8, the LS1 engine will be fine. Any wear parts (brakes, bearings, etc.) on the car will need replaced at some point; they tend not to hold up. You can blow up an auto trans if you or the previous owner drive it hard. The manuals will last forever; you may have to do the clutch. The interiors are cheap and tend to rattle.    If you are looking for a reliable daily driver, I would go elsewhere. Since you are looking at something sporty, a Grand Prix GTP or something along those lines would be cheaper and easier to maintain and more reliable. If you are looking for a car to beat on and have fun, the Camaro will hold up better than most cars people beat on. The parts are cheap. If you know how to wrench, there is not another that you can get down a 1/4 mile faster for less. Period.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	It's Camaro, and no, they are not a reliable car if you want it as a daily driver.

Reliability is marginal at best, but they sure are chick magnets.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	You don't buy a Camaro because it's reliable. You buy it because it's fast, fun to drive, looks good, and can be a classic. If you don't plan on doing some work on it yourself, then get something else.
GiOamMFzaa	Hi Apples. Seems like your cooling system needs a little colonic irrigation. Drain all the water out ( take the bottom hose off the radiator is the easiest way), dissolve a handful of washing soda in a gallon of hot water (wear gloves) & after reconnecting the hose put the soda in through the radiator filler cap. Top up with more warm water & take it out for a short spin. Drain the coolant again and watch what comes out, loads of yucky gunge usually. Flush the system with clean water & top up as normal.  The heater matrix is similar to a regular radiator, but on a smaller scale & can easily become partially blocked by dissolved solids. It only requires the equivalent of a spring clean. Best of luck.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be low on anti-freeze or the cooling system needs flushing. what about the fan, is it working? maybe the thermostat or the heater core is dirty. warm it up and feel the heater hoses. they both should feel hot.|`|912000dac9dc16add2d6670bdbe2720baa	Basically as the other 2 answers, if working while moving water/coolant is moving more---when you slow down--and fluid is low---no heating---ONLY check when engine is cool---so as to NOT get burned---most vehicles use 50/50 mixture ---but read your manual---for correct type of coolant---NOT just water. if problem persist---have the thermostat changed also--  rich .|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Possibly the coolant, but more likely the thermostat.  Check the fluid level in the reservoir.|`|fba450c791c2e5aa34640f936bd5aad7aa	needs coolant fast before you hurt the engine...dont put it in a hot and stopped engine,let the car cool down or leave it running while adding it.|`|5193f1efcd6be58503e419f249203831aa	Definitely LOW COOLANT!|`|UKNmZsU5aa	Yes, I think the coolant is low.

They're not worth "a lot", but they're at least double in price for a clean model since the year 2000, at least local to me, and that's saying a lot.    Are they ever going to be as vaunted as the early 70's gen II's? No, I doubt it - they're too underpowered and too common.

FgRUdQOBaa	Yes, of course people would, especially for short and intermediate distances., this has already been proven even with our embarrassingly mediocre transportation system.   However, maglev is not the answer, at least in the foreseeable future.   For a fraction of the cost per mile rail can be upgraded to true high speed rail, (as in Europe and Japan), while using most of the existing infrastructure.  These are capable of the same or nearly the same speeds as maglev, which can be well over 200 MPH.|`|2EVoNHHbaa	There was a serious proposal crafted several years ago to build one between Baltimore and Washington, DC.

Even if it's stolen.    If someone steals your vehicle and has an accident with it you are not legally responsible and the vehicle that was struck would have to file a claim  under their own policy    and that's no bull!!!!|`|kjAWsDwLaa	A claims manager once told me, "Insurance follows the car", so anyone driving the car with your permission is covered.

Many years ago I bought a pair of Cheng Shins that were virtual duplicates of the Dunlop K71, a discontinued tire.  Same tread design and same high center tread shape.

In additionm, the rear Marquis model was VERY loud.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Imitation tires, now that would be a first.    Dunlops are standard OEM tires on many makes and models, as are Bridgestone,  and on some imports Pirelli.    Whose name is on the tire is not as important as the right size of the tire, the correct tread pattern for the suspension.  If you buy decent tires you will have few problems, but for the most part stay away from bargain basement "Chen Shin" type tires  unless your inspection is coming due soon and you don't have the money to put decent tires on the bike, and the tread is not even there anymore.  Then and only then should you resort to bargain basement tires.

The battery has to be good in order for the starter motor to start spinning hard enough to make the drive gear kick out on the shaft.

mR5ZtjqWaa	history of the economy shows its hills and valleys, with hills peaking slightly higher with each valley.  In twenty years, we may be in a valley or heading there.     Still, I think airline industry would still be like today.  low cost, bad service, cramped, (unless you're rich etc. but with more efficient planes, running probably on a biofuel mix.  There will be lots of smaller regional airlines and less big airlines that serve destinations everywhere. Asian airlines will thrive, requiring 747s and A380s even on shorter domestic routes while north american airlines will all turn to using a low-cost operating scheme like jetblue, or ryanair. All in all, there would be a rise in ridership compared with today regardless. More planes will be in the air, airports will be bigger and "greener".    perhaps we might see the dawn of space tourism and the pioneers of hypersonic passenger flight by then as well. Nobody seems to even be bothering with supersonic commercial travel anymore. Concorde proved that the disadvantages outweighed the speed advantage. (And no matter how fast, still not faster than data through a fiber optic line)|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Domestic carriers will disappear, shrink routes, or raise prices.  The economic and environmental advantages of high-speed rail travel will displace them for most travel.   Domestic air travel will return to its status in the 50's-60s:  travel for the few who can afford it.  Small fuel-efficient biz jets (I agree, with the bio-fuel theory) will take the majority of immediate business traffic.  Business travelers are by far the bread and butter of current domestic traffic; thus expediting their demise/re-organization.  Long-haul, not much difference.  Still the most viable way to quickly hop the pond(s).  Too many potential environmental-fuel consumption impacts for hypersonic travel.  Supersonic commercial travel is dead-there is ZERO demand from travelers; and again it's not economically or environmentally savvy.  Freight travel will largely be accomplished via UAVs.  FedEx and UPS are currently funding serious studies to convert their main route to UAV operations.  Finally we all need to keep in mind, that if you told someone in the US in the early 1950's that airlines would replace domestic rail travel in 15 years they would've thought you insane.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Still as troubled as it is today.|`|Dzr2ZcdZaa	bigger... new inventions|`|yPBCY5X2aa	Same as today.

L0H4iVHWaa	well if the subs are 2 or 4ohm dvc theres a few options    if they are 2 ohm dvc:    wire them into a single 2 ohm load, and get an mono class-d amplifier that can put out 2000 watts x1 @ 2 ohms    if they are 4 ohm dvc    you have 2 options for this (go with my first one i say it is cheaper)    wire your subs into a single 1 ohm load, and get a mono class-d amplifier that puts out 2000 rms watts x 1 @ 1 ohm    OR    wire your subs into a single 4 ohm load, and get a mono class-d amplifier that puts out 2000 rms watts x 1 @ 4 ohm (this will be expensive to find an amp that puts out 2000 watts rms at 4 ohms)      and this is assuming those subs are 1000 rms watts a peice right? any of those options will put the full amount of rms watts those subs need to perform their best.|`|AA11318686	As long as your amp doesn't exceed either 1,000w per channel or 2,000w on a monoblock you should be fine with either a pair of Kicker zx1000.1 or a BXI2008D monoblock.

AA12265870	It doesn't have a vacuum pump.The vacuum hose should be somewhere at the rear of the intake manifold,probably left of the distributor.Trace all the vacuum hoses to see if their cracked,unhooked,or have transmission fluid in them.If the blazer is 4wd,there is a vacuum switch on the transfer case that goes bad and the engine vacuum sucks the fluid out of transfer case and distributes it throughout all the vacuum lines ruining all the soft rubber parts.Sounds like your not getting enough vacuum to the interior.Should be above 15 inches.
d9ECb7N8aa	Shades 4u, if your truck is truly a '95, then you have a TBI motor, not the Vortec.     Mileage depends on truck options (what is the axle ratio???).    Mileage will differ from truck to truck slightly, and even tire sizing and tread pattern will affect mileage.    I have a '97 1/2 ton 4wd, extended cab short bed. It has 3.73 gears, 265/75R16 all-terrain tire tread.   With the fiberglass camper shell (cab height), thick rubber bet mat, 4' tool box in bed full of crap, winch, full tank of fuel, and me (220lb) the truck weights 5900-6100lbs depending on scale.    With that weight running 65-70mph I can easily get 18-20mpg. I have gotten 22-23 a few times.   Running 75-80 (turning 2000rpm at 75) mileage drops to 16-18.     Combo town/freeway driving with approx 10min idle time during initial start of the day with block heater plugged in (truck has heavy frost in am) I have been getting 14mpg. Speeds range from 35-65 for approx 40 miles per day.    I know I could free up some mileage if I pulled the tool box to shed a few hundred pounds...|`|DV4xyeChaa	15 town 20 hyway....is what you can get...give take 1 mpg|`|lgjIwUftaa	i have a 1995 silverado 2wd and get 18 mpg with the truck all stock. 1996 was the first year for the vortec motor and they are supposed to be better.

I think your bigger concern should be fuel. I don't think fuel price will stay low for that long. Then you will be stuck with a large SUV and the gas bill to go with it.|`|WGdDu0dzaa	Brand new cars have very little profit in them. In spite of what the general public seems to think, the dealers cost on the vehicle is not tens of thousands below the sticker. The average is 5-7% and that is pretty much all they have to work with. The biggest "discounts" are in the form of factory rebates, and you are looking at a brand that doles out very little if any. The price will go up next year, not down.
AA11872632	YOU need a new cooling fan motor, in front of your radiator.  NOW!  The only reason you haven't boiled over is, it is winter time and cold winter air is cooling your radiator as you drive.    TEST the fan by adding 12 volts to it directly.  Does it spin fast?  or not?  I don't think this fan is belt driven...I have a 1990 Buick Century V6....electric fan!    TEST for head gasket problems by seeing air bubbles in your coolant expansion tank.  Or oily white mayonaise on oil cap or dipstick or LOTS of constant white steam/smoke out the exhaust pipe.  (GOOD ADVICE, Will.  I gave you a thumbs up!)|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 got enough 50/50 coolant/water mix  2 radiator been flushed  3 hoses ok? soft ones flatten out when hot [secret no one knows shhhh]  4 thermostate should be put   1  5 fan comming on or belt driven ok?|`|79022e34b048d2b4a3870d9ff8552c02aa	Sounds like the coolant level is low.Don't let it run hot for very long or you will be replacing a head gasket.|`|TZz1uPY2aa	Even new thermostats can be defective. Sometimes the cause can simply be the radiator cap. But it sounds like your head gasket needs replacing. Sometimes when they're ready to go(small hole). It won't effect the engine power ,so to speak,. But the temp will go up. It's kind of your engine telling you something is wrong and needs attention. I would do all of the above mentioned first. Because they are relatively cheap in comparison to headgasket replacing.|`|uP7hig0zaa	well  see i have  a 95  oldmobile cultless  which is my baby i traded  my 85 old  for  the car  which  my 85 ran  real good  but i am 19  years old  and  need something more  my style wheni got  it he said there was some problems  wrong with  it over heated and  it did  so  replaced my intake gasest and head gaset so  what it could be my blew in in the intake right by the water jacket u shold   go ahead  and replace   the head gaset to   hope this helps
RTBvQJHbaa	First off the pop is not going to be a strut....  They are using shocks in a tahoe, that could be your problem, it could also be just a break glazing issue that could be really easily fixed.  Or it could be a sway bar link broken another cheap fix, if you don't have break noise its probable one of those would be the cause of the pop, can't tell haven't looked at but best guess. Also if its making the noise from the rear or front ?????  Poping in front with out turning is more than likely a ball joint, if turning a tie rod end or two.  Mileage is a big part in this problem to if its got more then 60k it maybe the joint that can be a little bit of $$ most shops should give you a diagnosis for free of very cheap, and if you do your own work that would be the easy way out, if its the ball joint I recommend you have a shop do it they are generally pressed in on that truck, that would run a lot more to buy the tool then just paying to have it fixed.  Also don't go with the cheapest parts for suspension a good mid range mooge are great on those no matter the year.  Hope that cleared it up alittle.|`|DV4xyeChaa	back pop....maybe loose/worn strut ,,hope its not brakes..    gurgle...check coolant level..fill with 50/50  coolant/water mix.|`|27MZpZrBaa	The rattling or gurgling could be a lot of things.  Try to distinguish which it is.  Gurgling is going to be something in your coolant system.  I had the rattling problem when taking off, and it turned out to be the shielding on my catalytic converter, nothing to worry about.
daw140ceaa	You're looking for a high-pass filter.  Many head units, and most full-range amplifiers, have them built in.  Otherwise, you can install simple passive filters on your speaker wires.  These are usually called "bass blockers" and should be available at any car audio store.

daw140ceaa	There's no very good way to wire this, because your amplifier can't be used with a 2-ohm load in "bridged" mode.  2-ohm stable stereo amps are only 2-ohm stable in 2-channel mode; if you bridge them, you need to keep the impedance at 4 ohms or higher.    If I were wiring this sub/amp combo, I'd wire the voice coils in series for an 8-ohm load, and connect it to the amplifier in bridged mode.  An amplifier that's bridged to 8 ohms will typically produce the combined power of both channels at 4 ohms.  In other words, if the amp's rated at 50 watts per channel at 4 ohms, it should produce around 100 watts bridged to an 8-ohm load.  This is the simplest safe method of wiring this type of sub to a 2-channel amp.    Here's a wiring diagram:    http://mobile.jlaudio.com/graphics/Suppo...

FGlSULkxaa	Ultralights operate basically the same was as on airplane does. A power plant creates thrust, this thrust pushes or pull the aircraft through the air, as soon as enough speed is built up the airflow over/under the wings creates a lifting force great enough to overcome gravity and send the aircraft into the air. So basically an ultralight operates on the same principles as an airplane, however it must be under a certain weight to be classified as an ultralight, and you do not need a pilot certificate to fly one.|`|5656d5ab22b21df010a9c35d05e22c81aa	I would suggest that you visit this site https://www.eaa.org/ its a website dedicated to ultralights, homebuilts, and experimental aircraft.

daw140ceaa	More and more devices are combining cell phone and music functions, and that trend will probably continue.  Bluetooth head units are handy for both functions.  Many Bluetooth-enabled CD players can be used as hands-free phone kits, and will automatically mute the music when you get a call, and play the caller's voice through the vehicle's speakers.  If you have a phone that plays music, you can listen through the CD player without any wires.      Bluetooth functions are perfect for car audio, because you don't have to make any wired connections.  Your phone stays in your pocket or the glove box, but you can still listen to music or place/receive calls.

v77NR2WGaa	The car's manual should have this information on this or an sticker on the rear trunk that explains where to do it . It is commonly known that you use it on the middle part of the car under the frame(behind the front wheel or in front of the rear wheel ,they may have notches in the bottom of the car body that is your car jack lifting points.   Below is the picture page at autozone ,it shows with pictures where u put them
W8GMnYMZaa	I think...this is a guess but you can check it out.  There should be a button on the radio that says auxilary.  That should be it.|`|J4HEAO5kaa	that depends on if you have satellite radio or not.  If you don't there will be an AUX button.  If you do you will need to press the SAT button.

gEw83TRTaa	When you trade a car they get a 10-day payoff.  That will be the principle balance owed on the car, plus 10 days worth of interest.  That is the final number that will be calculated against the value of the car.  Just call your finance company and ask for a 10-day payoff.  Also get the perdiem rate.  That is the amount added to the loan for each day past 10.  SO if you dont get teh deal done for 13 days,  you will know exactly what is owed.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Simply call the lender and asked for the amount of the pay off - this is the figure that the salesman will get and it will be significantly less than the deferred payment total.|`|WGdDu0dzaa	Auto loans are "simple interest" that means that you only pay interest while you are using the money. You would only pay the 5440 if the loan went to full term. When you pay the note early, the interest stops at what you have already paid.

t2rUhyANaa	Models with one-piece cast wheels take tubeless tires, those with laced-up spoked wheels require tubes.|`|fKVF8fufaa	If the wheels are spoked it has a tube in there.
f1ffc65ad74f3fc378ca59f44fc53d42aa	I sounds like a hydraulic valve lifter. Check your oil level in the engine.  If it is not low, then you just might have a bad lifter. No reason to replace the whole engine.    However, if that tapping is a rod, then it will eventually break and could tear up the engine block.|`|d26cf5d0bc2ff44ed0bd39e786f279e6aa	Change oil and even run an additive like Lucas in it.  If the tapping gets louder, you're screwed.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s probably just the lifters. change the oil and put some additive in it.|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	We sell them for $2000, rebuilt with a good core. You may consider that those engines use chains for the timing, which will eventually stretch past the throw of the hydraulic tensioners. This can happen after very few or very many miles depending on your maintenance. The engine is likely tired by that point anyway, and could benefit from a rebuild.|`|5XS8KvUxaa	Try just changing you oil and letting it idle for a while and warm up it may just be your valves tapping becuase of thick oil sitting??? HOPE I HELPED

Check for corrosion on all the connections under the hood and dash.|`|ATBtH7eTaa	I had a problem like that a year ago with my 98 chrysler and I ended up taking it to a mechanic. Don't remember exactly what it was but the dude said it was something pretty simple and very easy to look over when you check on it yourself. Only cost me three hundred to fix.|`|vweoheAvaa	The only suggestion I have is that your car needs a maintenance check.
TsJoADGPaa	are you sure you have a wheel cover, or do you have actual full wheels? For a wheel cover, you just need to use something to pry evenly around the rim until it pops off. It may take a little force.    For actual wheels, there is usually a center cap covering the bolts, there should be a little notch for a screw driver or other tool to pop it off.|`|fuNlYxS9aa	if it has little plastic nuts on the covet then those need to be pulled off with a special tool that came with the car (check in the glove box) if not hten just pull it off
