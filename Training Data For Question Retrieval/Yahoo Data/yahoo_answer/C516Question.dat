20090220044425AABOnGF	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Do I have a problem with my knee?	Afew years ago I went to my GP about a clicking in my knee when I moved. (ie walking up stairs or getting up from sitting down) at the same, the GP laughed it away saying its normal and part of growth. Now however... the sound has increased by a large amount. Almost sounds like the crunching a crisp packet (if you know what I mean) it also "feels" unsupportive.      Its only happening in one knee, my left knee is fine. When riding a bike I have no problems pushing down with my left, but the right knee feels strange. no pain, but feels like something is there and feels unsupportive.      When I play football and run about I dont notice it, but anything that involes heavy pressure on the knee I can feel it.      Whats wrong?

At the two month mark for my back/chest, I could really see the results. But at the two month mark for my face, I didn't really see a difference. Could this be because I started supplementing with creatine and whey protein one month ago? I don't want to stop taking creatine, but if it's increasing my acne, I definitely will.

I have put on a bit of weight, so I'm starting the gym next week and I'm going to watch what I eat more carefully. BUT even when I was I slimmer (size 8, size 10) I had problems with my stomach. People have asked in the past if I'm pregnant! But I'm not and never have been! Do you think I could have IBS or be allergic to certain foods or do you think I could have something else?

20090220041346AA6zwAX	Health;Mental Health	Please help me...I am very stressed out and I need advice before I go over the edge?	Let me give you some background on myself. I am 17 and a senior in high school. I have roughly a 3.5 gpa and have been accepted to every college I have applied to and so far have recieve an offer of 10k scholarship to one and 14k to another-with others to come soon. Okay so I get migraines 2-3x's/wk and get dizziness which causes my eyes to go black for 2-secs to a few mins. It makes it difficult to go to school so I have missed about 38 days so far this year. We are trying to get home bound (teacher comes to the house, my sister got it for a whole year for getting pregnant) but they are giving a tough time about it. We should know by today, the doctor probably will sign it. I am about to break though. My mother and step-father were talking about kicking me out of the house because this is causing them so much stress. They said they can't deal with me. I am not much more welcome at my dad's house as he gives my sister everything she wants and I end up with the short end of the stick--it would be even moreso now that the baby is there and is 10 months old. My sister came home drunk, did drugs, got pregnant, and NO ONE ever threatened to kick her out. Why is it that I get sick by something that I can't control and they want to kick me out? I can't work at your traditional stand up place. I've tried it. I almost passed out several times. What should I do? I am very upset by this. I think it may have just been better I was never born because neither of my parents have ever seemed to want me and when things get bad they always threaten calling the cops or sending me away or something. I am a good student and a good kid. What did I do wrong?

20090220034422AAFwTc4	Health;Women's Health	A question for people who have experienced thyroid problems?	So for the past few months or so I have been having a lot of changes. At first I just thought that it had to do with my body readjusting itself since I recently had a baby (5 months ago). So little things I have been noticing is anxiety (nervousness), mild depression (my hubby goes away 4 days a week and we live in a basement apartment with one window. I thought these were little things that were contributing to the depression feeling), recently started feeling insomniac. I haven't been able to get to bed until anywhere between 12am and 2am for the past few months (my son sleeps anywhere from 8pm-10pm until around 7am to 9am), lots of hair loss in the shower and throughout the day (not bald spots or anything but definitely losing a lot more hair than EVER before), tiredness, and constipation (although lately I have been having terrible knotting in my stomach and having what seems to be like diarrhea sorry TMI). The past 2 weeks I have noticed this lump underneath my chin. When I put my head down it aggravates it...I can actually push my finger up under my chin and feel it, it is sore. I know that my thyroid is like the "adams apple" (although I am a woman lol) but the other day I decided to look up thyroid problems and I found that the symptoms of that are all of the ones that I am experiencing (except for the lump feeling...almost like a swollen gland that is very uncomfortable). Does this sound like a thyroid problem? Another thing I should add is that I am having the toughest time losing the baby weight. Although I do not eat well ALL the time, I have been exercising a lot and eating much healthier than usual. STILL no weight loss. This morning I started having this feeling of "growing pains" in my calves. I went to bed around 1am and woke up at 5:45am and haven't been able to go back to sleep since...because of the feeling in my legs. It is like I cannot stretch them enough. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY BODY? I AM going to make an appointment with the doctor but I just wanted to hear of some personal experiences. I feel like I have no control of what is going on!

Age: 17 years 5 months   Sex: Boy   Height: 5 feet 8   Weight: 143   According to the website I use my BMI is: 21.4   What does my BMI have to be at before I can start forming visible abs?   Right now I am part of a gym. I do dumbbell press with 25lbs, leg press with 540lbs, band row with 80lbs, leg lifts and leg crunches with the Roman Chair( http://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercis...  and I run a mile or 2 averaging 7-9 minutes a mile. I drink only water and sometimes milk, no soda. After every work out I have one or two scoops of my whey protein. I usually eat a banana and or chicken breasts after a work out. And I usually work out every other day(Depends on my work schedule).      I have been going to the gym doing these work outs, in variation, since Christmas. Though I have been working out in my room for over a year. I use to be doing 300 sit ups, tons of crunches, bicycle kicks, leg lifts on the floor. It didn't see that was doing anything for my abs. I was also using my 20lb dumbbells to work my arms and I did push ups.

20090220032509AAeoVyL	Health;Diet & Fitness	Losing 40 pounds in 3.5 months! By this June 4th :)...tips?	Ok, first off, please don't say I can't do this. Before,I simply adhered to a 1,600 calorie diet, NO WORKING OUT AT ALL, and I lost 25 pounds in just BARELY over 2 months. So considering that I am going to be consuming 1,300-1,400 and doing an hour of elliptical everyday until June 4th hits..I think it's manageable. My question is...what are some good tips? I normally rather lose weight slowly..but this is a once in a while thing..where I am going on a vacation..and need to slim down a tad quicker. I'm 198 right now and need to be down to 158...btw I am ABOUT 5'4 and 158, believe it or not, looks REALLY good on me...I don't look fat whatsoever..but that could have a lot to do with the fact that I am nearly a DD bra cup and have an hourglass figure with some HIPS.       Quickly, this is what I look like at 198::: http://s34.photobucket.com/albums/d115/d...             And this is what I look like at 172:: http://i286.photobucket.com/albums/ll93/...       I realize that pic is quite risque..but it's one of the only ones that I could find to project what body type/size we're dealing with here. As you can see, at 172, YES, I still have weight to lose..but I'm not as huge as you might have thought a girl of 5'4 would be. This is why I'm saying 158 is going to look decent, in the meantime, until I can reach my goal of 120 or something.

20090220032049AAt9nGh	Health;Dental	Dentistry expert - opinion about tooth extraction from hell!?	Around 3 weeks back I had a tooth extracted.  I ended up having close to 14 numbing needs, into the gum, tooth then directly into the bone.  Even with the happy-gas I could still feel everything (which was really painful).  My question is that after 3 weeks, it looks like the dentist removed part of my gum (the side) and although the hole in the gum is healing, I am extremely sensitive to hot and cold.  Is this normal as I thought the nerve would have been removed when the tooth was puled out.      I know I should go back to the dentist but I'm scared of needles and don't want this woman anywhere near me again LOL.  Your help would be appreciated.

20090203124338AAj9nEs	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Might I be lactose intolerant if (only) recently I've been having stomach pain/gas after drinking milk?	I've always drank a LOT of milk (I'm 20 now) and never had any problems. Lately I've been drinking it more than normal (2/3 pints a day, in one go) and I noticed afterwards I'd feel sort of bloated, sometimes with stomach pain from trapped gas.      Those are my only symptoms however, and nothing close to other symptoms normally related with lactose intolerance (e.g. nauseau/diarrhea).       Could this be the start of lactose intolerance, even though I'm almost 21 and never had problems before? Or can other things contribute to poor milk digestion in 'normal' people (malnutrition/ or just too much in one go!)?

I was in bed with my boyfriend last night and we were having a discussion about whether it was right for us to stay together or not and I started crying and the last thing I remember was being worried about us and then I went to sleep. I woke up at 4:33 in the morning and my underwear felt wet and then I looked and realised that I wet the bed and I can't understand why? The last time I wet the bed my age wasn't   even in double figures. It's been years. So why have I started last night so suddenly? Also, the right side of my abdomen really hurts, it's probably not connected but worth a try eh. Despite what happened last night me and my boyfriend are fine, it's a good job we've been together a long time otherwise it would've been really embarrassing.

Hey everyone, thank you for clicking on my question =)      My stats:   Age: 20   Height: 5"4   Weight: 9 1/2 stone   Occupation: University student   Current exercise activity: 10 hours a week (gym, cardio, cheerleading, dance and exercise classes).      My problem is that in the last few days I have had NO control what so ever over my eating habits.      My normal food diary:   Breakfast: smoothie; mango, raspberries, banana, oats, yoghurt, skimmed milk   snack: pear   lunch: salad and 2 oatcakes with peanut butter and honey   snack: yoghurt and honey   dinner: tomato and mozzarella salad   snack: hot chocolate      My current food diary:   smoothie;mango, raspberries, banana, oats, yoghurt, skimmed milk   pitta bread with honey and peanut butter   about 20 grapes and 7 slices of brie cheese   yoghurt with honey and banana   pitta bread with caramelized onion chutney and brie cheese   salad   packet of crisps   another smoothie,   porridge with 1 whole mango and yoghurt.      I just can't stop eating!    It definitely affects my mood and my confidence.   I went the other extreme recently and started to eat only small amounts to keep me not starving i.e      breakfast: 1 oatcake   lunch: cucumber and juice   dinner: half a pita bread and cottage cheese      it felt amazing eating like that but i can't seem to do it anymore.      I've been having family problems recently which could be a factor and also that at Uni we all sit in the kitchen constantly as it's our only communal area.      Please just give me some kind of motivational help or some kind of guidance please as right now i feel like a greedy, fat, useless monster :(         Thank you for your kind attention and I look forward to hearing your answers =)      xxxxxxxx

But this last week I've been always hungry. I'm 16, female, and my bmi is normal (19).       In the last week I've been eating between 2,000 and 4,000 calories everyday. Some days I don't exercise, but I aim for 1/2 hour per day.      Why am I always so hungry? Like today I've had 3,300 cal so far and I'm ready for a meal. Please some advice would be great.
20090220005614AAhFYvQ	Health;Diet & Fitness	18 year old trying to lose weight?	Alright so I'm a girl, just about to turn 18, and I weigh roughly 140 lbs. I have an hourglass figure, and unfortunately I have a little extra on my thighs, butt, lovehandles, and lower abs (basically my midsection). What can I do to try and slim down these areas? I'm dieting, I have around 4 small meals a day every 3 or so hours, and I just got a gym pass to 24 hour fitness and I exercise just about every other morning. What else can I do to boost the weight loss? For example, what exercises can I do at the gym, is there anything better I can do with the diet, etc. And please don't suggest any diet pills or anything to me, I've never taken diet pills and never plan to. My goal is to get back down to at the most 120 in the next 3 months, if that's even possible.  Thank you!
20090220012604AAteXEg	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Breast cancer? How possible is it?	So, I went last May to my Gyn to do some tests and she gave me a breast exam (since im pretty... uhm idk i just cant stand doing it). She felt a couple of lumps she said were ok nothing to worry about. Still I decided Id go check with an oncologist who told me they seemed to be ok but jus in case to do an ultrasound. I didnt do it because it was too expesive and he told me they were ok. My gma had lumps that werent cancer, my mom has none. I have another one or maybe its because my breasts are tender I am not sure but overall Id like to know how possible it is that they are bad lumps?      no mean answers plz
20090220021504AAaplDK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Does The Government Have The Cure For Cancer?	In my opinion I believe that the government actually does have the cure.  If you think about it look at how much money they are making from treatments, if we didn't have cancer there would be an economical crash.  We have been fighting the war on cancer for over 30 years, and look how far have we gotten with the billions of dollars given to cancer research; Not even one cure for any type of cancer.  In my opinion this is somewhat suspicious.  Many people think of these theories as conspiracies, but you must think outside of the box.   I am just wondering what other people are thinking regarding this subject.

20090220023050AAibFkP	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Am I Asthmatic or just paranoid?	I suspect that I might be asthmatic.I've been having this so-called breathing difficulties for quite a number of years (3 years to be exact) but these difficulties are not that regular just on/off especially when there's loads of dust involved.I was once diagnosed with upper respiratory problem (2 years ago) but after they gave me some medication, I was ok.      Recently,I was down with flu however the runny nose,itchy eyes/nose had stopped after taking some medication.But I still have excessive phlegm and I can't seem to breath properly.I will have shortness of breath when I'm walking too quickly or talking too fast. There is a feeling of pressure in my chest when I breathe and I could occasionally hear wheezing noises when I lie on my side.The clinic docter I went to just thought of it as normal flu, but something tells me that it's not.       Am I just being paranoid?   The thing is, I had never suffered from asthma during my childhood and now that I'm in my teens is it possible to just get asthma?

20090220031046AAxfbng	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	I've developed a rash on my inner thigh. What is it, and how can I make it leave?	It is NOT a chafing rash/heat rash/sweat rash.  I'm not a featherweight, and I live in a hot climate, so I'm familiar with those, and this is all new.  It's dry and itchy, and the area's raised up a bit.  It's only been there for a few days now, about 3-4 of them.  I DID get new panties from the store during this time (from a sealed package, not the 'pick up and buy' kind that anyone could have handled.) which were my normal size.  I've not gotten any other new clothes.  Normally, before the rash appeared, the skin there was overly dry.  I much preferred that to how it is now.  I've tried Gold Bond as well as products with salicylic (sp?) acid, like stridex pads and such.  The gold bond relieves the itch for about 5-10 minutes after application, but fades quickly.  From my online resources and research, I doubt heavily that it's jock itch or anything of that sort.  I also doubt it's an STD of any sort.  I'm in an exclusive relationship that I've been in for about 5 years, and I know my guy's loyal, AND clean, as am I (We've had tests done).  The onset was sudden.  The itch is terrible, and it's currently depriving me of sleep (Oh gold bond, why don't you kill the itch longer so I can rest).   Any information or ideas someone could give would be awesome.  I would go straight to a doctor, but as many people are right now, I am without health insurance, so it costs and arm and a leg, and I want it to be a last-resort effort for something that's not threatening my overall good health.  Thanks!

20090220055550AAOuEzu	Health;Mental Health	How do you change yourself without risking losing your friends?	For a long time, I have been a highly-sensitive person, let my emotions control me, lacked self-esteem and confidence. I've never had many friends in my life as my socialising skills aren't very high (the causes for them are private, yet genuine and understandable reasons for the way I am). I'm happy to say I have a few, true friends in my life whom I'm very close to.       In the early spring of 2008, during the aftermath of the most INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL experience I ever had to face, I came away with a huge, definate decision...if I'm going to survive in life and be happy, I NEED to toughen myself up!      Ever since then, I have been making a conscious effort to toughen myself up, both emotionally and physically. I fell in love with self-help books (they're very inspiring), enjoy doing self-hypnosis and have started attending all kinds of activities that allows me to socialise with other people and have began to make some new friends along the way.      To put this all into short....I am toughening myself up and finally taking control of my life.      So far, I have been making wonderful progress as I have already noticed the changes in my life, the way people act towards me and I can even FEEL the changes. Some people I have met along my way towards my new-self have said how much they admire me for my strength and confidence. I no longer feel so scared and needing to run to others for help. Quite the opposite, in fact. I've actually had people coming to ME for advice and help and I've been so proud that I can actually help my friends and other people for a change, as I have shared their experiences.      My family have also noticed my gradual change in the type of music I like to listen to, the movies I like to watch and even my change in thoughts towards certain situations.      Here is what is stopping me from reaching my goal to my new, confident-self.      Like I said before, I have a few, true friends in my life who care about me very much and have been there for me through the good and bad times. However, when they first met me, they got to know and like the OLD me, but what will they think about the new me?      What happens when I finally fulfill my dream, turn my life around and become the tougher, more confident person I've always wanted to be, only for my friends to not like the new me and leave me?       I want to fulfill my wish to become a stronger, more confident person, but I don't want to lose my friends.      How do you choose between your friends and yourself?      Thank you.

Whenever I do things simple like start to put my socks on or something, I always have to do them a certain way. Not in an OCD manor, but because I have like a voice in my head that tells me if I don't do it a certain way, something bad will happen.       I always have to put my contacts in left eye then right, wear the socks i am told to (told by myself) and stuff like this. When I was doing my homework recently, I wrote a word and i kept messing up the P. after seix or seven times of redoing it because my mind kept telling me it wasn't looking right, I snapped and shouted at myself to "shut up! it looks fine now leave me alone!".

I have a really strange gift, i cant really explain it all to you, because it would fill the enitire QS...but here goes, i somehow tapped into a nearly limitless energy source in my body, i can control how much i have and when i can use it and where i want to send it to in my body. It feels like an excited feeling (you know, the kind you get when your all hyped up?) its been proven to make me stronger, faster, more resiliant, and increases many of my other senses. But i cant hold it up for much more than 10-15 secs without getting tired. 3 years ago, I was playing soccer with my friends when i all of a sudden started to feel the feeling, it just came to me. So i continued to paly, but i had much much more energy than uusual and i was able to literaly turn it on or off, (it only appeared in my left hand) Now i am able to form it any where in my body and it feels much stronger. It takes my cramps away when i send it to the specified area. This part is even gonna sound weirder, i think i found a way to send it outside my body, i dont know how, but i think im able to send it out of my left hand ((where its the strongest) and actualy form a layer of it over my skin.

I know that all the parts of my life that I hate right now will begin to blossom once I get rid of this toxic vice.

He's also said that in the past, his girlfriends have told him similar things, that they didn't have problems with yeast infections before they were with him. He takes showers every day and generally keeps pretty clean. No, he doesn't cheat on me, so he's not getting it from another woman.      So can a man be the cause for a yeast infection in a woman?

I have a smallish cyst type thing on the vulva lips of my vagina, it is only about a couple of mm's and I have had it for nearly a year but i'm really paranoid. I went to the clinic a few months ago to get checked out... they told me that I was free from STIs and that the lump looked just like a small minor cyst and I shouldn't worry, but keep an eye on it and come back if it changed in any way. The cyst is quite small but noticeable, it's white and has stayed the same colour and size for a while... but i'm paranoid it's gonna get bigger or develop into cancer... However I think it would be too small to get it removed at the moment but I don't know if it will change! But if the Doctor said it was OK, surely I'm worrying about nothing...   But I just don't like it what should I do?       Ps... I will try natural remedies

Now also my right shoulder blade seems to have a constant tingly sensation kinda like when your leg falls asleep, and that is running up into top of shoulder and into arm and also down side of my back. SOMETIMES not always but when i take a deep breath under right shoulder blade kinda hurts. I have gone and had gallbladder ultrasound done and they said it was normal. I had an H-pylori test where they check for cancer causing bacteria and it was normal, and they also checked my liver, kidneys, sodium , red blood cells and white and all of this was normal. Oh and everytime i take deep breath or stretch my back seems to be always popping. I guess I am hoping for a little piece of mind before i go to dr again.

20090220072836AAfoWtu	Health;Mental Health	My 5 year old hears voices?? an update?	Yesterday I posted this about my daughter:When my daughter was 2 she would talk to her hands, and make them hit each other for not doing what they were suppose to do. This was strange since we don't hit her. There is no violence in my family at all. Over the past few years she has talked to people who weren't there. When asked who she's talking to she says "no one" A few months ago she started saying "God damn it" which we don't say... so I asked her "where did you hear that??" and she said "Shadow man said it" UGH sooo creepy. She also talked to Shadow man at my brothers house while she was staying the night with her cousin. And now, she's hitting her head saying "the people in my head won't stop talking I can't think" I wouldn't be so concerned if this were the first time she'd done something weird. But it's not. This has been going on and off since she was two. Not the voices but.. the oddness. I'm going to talk to her psychiatrist about it, but I just want to get other opinions. I feel like I've done something wrong as a parent. I'm hoping it's all been for attention, maybe I don't pay enough attention to her! Her teacher had to call me on the phone today telling me she was doing the head hitting and talking about the voices in class.. I feel so embarrassed and sad for her because all those kids were staring at her. Some websites say this is normal, for kids to hear voices. They grow out of it. But what about the people she sees and talks to? Could this be a game she plays with herself? She wasn't very socialized with other kids til she started school this year. Now I'm thinking that was a horrible mistake.      Now when she got home I asked her what happen, and she said with an angry face "That didn't happen!" I pressed on... She eventually said her work was too hard. But I talked to her teacher and told her what she said and her teacher says "It didn't seem like she was making it up, she was covering her ears screaming the people in my head won't be quiet and I can't think" she said that my daughter seems scared and really really frustrated. I asked if the other kids were mean about it and she said "OH no they kept telling her it will be ok , it's ok" So I'm relieved about that. Her Dr. said they want to give her an EEG and make sure she's not having seizures. They also said something about admitting her! I said NO WAY. she's not harmful to herself or anyone around her. I couldn't get my daughter to tell me what they were saying or who they were, she just kept denying that she heard anything. Her teacher says it didn't look like a seizure and she was "in her own world, in her own zone" after talking with her teacher I"m even more concerned about it. Why would she deny it now?? I told her she's not in trouble but mommy needs to know what's going on so I can fix it. I had to bribe her with quarters for her piggy bank for her to just tell me her school work was too hard. Her assignment was to draw a picture or write about whatever she wanted to. Should I be worried yet? I don't know if it was real or not. I can't get a straight answer from her

20090220070045AAuGGw8	Health;Mental Health	My personality changes on a daily basis. I don't even know who I am anymore. What should I do?	I have two wonderful parents and I've been fortunate to grow up in a good environment, but ever since I can remember, weird things go on in head.       For example my hobbies change on a daily basis - Today I could like horror movies and next week I could hate them so much that anyone who mentions a horror movie will get an evil look from me. Then the next week after that I might start liking them again.       My personality is also unpredictable. It is impossible to describe me because I change every day. I might be a freindly sociable person today but tommorow I could be the opposite. Same applies to my temper - I could go a few months without having any temper problems and out of nowhere, without warning, I could turn into a raging monster with a very short fuse for a few months.      Same applies to my choice of freinds at school. This week I'll probably only hang around with a really quiet person who doesn't talk over me and who lets me do all the talking. But a few days from now, I'll probably try to avoid him because he never talks much and I'll only hang out with talkative people. After a few days, I'll go back to hanging out with the quiet person.        Same applies to my favourite subjects at school, computer games, favourite sports, favourite music etc. Everything changes on a daily basis in an unpredictable fashion. There is not even a pattern to how the changes happen. Everything is like a roll of the dice.      For example, after I finish typing this question,I could decide that I hate yahoo answers, and anyone who uses it needs to get a life. That is how weird I am.

20090220061539AAQ2oDf	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Helping a teen get through a real rough week, Emotional and Physical Stress?	He's been going through a real rough week, and it just started getting bad on wednesday. It started when he woke up to feed his gerbil but he finds it laying dead, he's having a real hard time in school with the new math reviews and is overwhelmed with homework.He has 2 fillings at the dentist on sunday. He's been having growing pains since monday and they've been getting worse. He's almost grown a inch in the last month, from 5'2 1/2 to just about 5'3 and is 14 years old. He came home from school yesterday and had a pinched nerve in his neck from twisting it accidently in gym class when they were doing wrestling, then accidently injured his lower back and he said it was completely sore earlier today. The pinched nerve is supposed to go away in around 3 days, so right now he can't move his head right or left.He has a math test and a english test on monday, and told me he's probably going to fail the math since he's not ready.      I was with him earlier this evening and he fell asleep at around midnight. He's still there fast asleep, right behind me on the couch. I'm about to carry him off to his bed and let him sleep in. I'm going to have him stay home today from school. Definately not in the shape.      He's been completely choked since wednesday, I can really see he's been completely stressed and feels down on himself, has already let out some tears. I want to prevent anymore stress for him for this week, maybe have him go to school for next tuesday if he isn't ready for his tests.What would be the Best things I can do, to help him cope through this rough week for him and just comfort him until he's up and well again? I'm planning on helping him with his math when he feels like doing some (and yes we both suck at math)      Thanks!

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET.

Usually I'm a 'happy chap'. rainbows, lollipops all that crap, thinking about/loving masturbating/sex but sometimes I go through slumps, they may last anywhere from 2weeks - 3+months. Today (well since Dec) it was (has been) hot and humid, I've been suffering from prickly heat, even though I use soap and water and I clean myself thoroughly every day, which I think has caused me to be emotional but I'm not sure. Today I started crying at the weather report because it reported hot, humid days ahead, the thought of sex pisses me off to the point where I started idealizing suicide, I know it's bad to think of killing myself over something so trivial but then I start thinking of everything else and how it all seems so goddamn pointless. And I've been feeling more and more tired, usually it's the other way round where I can't sleep, I'll basically need less sleep. And part of me doesn't want to get out of bed. I'm an emotional wreck, I don't want to go to a counselor, every counselor I've seen has been so goddamned patronizing =_= BUT anyways I'm wondering if heat can cause .. well not Cause per se but encourage emotional instability?

20090220045749AAh4xfM	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Should I stop taking Prilosec?(Omeprazole)?	Hello,               2 days ago I woke up with a sore stomach, and I had a Rennies(antacid) to try to settle my stomach. I just ignored the pain and had breakfast as usual(bowl of cereal and a mango smoothie). Anyway so I went to college as usual and worked out and did my daily routine, but the stomach pain was lingering all day. Between the time I woke up I had about 6 rennies total. At about dinner time, the pain was still there in the background, but like and idiot I decided to order a chinese to spoil myself after a hard days work. Anyway so the chinese went down fairly well, I was really stuffed and I went to bed about 12:30. Before I nodded off to sleep, i could feel the stomach pains coming back but this time more pronounced. Anyway so I just ignored it went to sleep. At six in the morning I woke up with agonizing stomach pain, and really acidy heartburn, I ran to the bathroom because I could feel the acid coming up and I thought I was going to vomit. I didn't end up vomitting, but I felt like I either needed to get sick, or take a crap, but I couldn't do either. My stomach felt really bloated and in knots, and so i tried to force out a crap(sorry for the details), but I was ridicuously constipated and it took a lot of effort. So i stayed up for the next few hours in excrutiating pain and I went to see the doctor. I presummed I caught some sort of a stomach bug or virus or something. I told the doc about my symptoms(difficulty moving bowels, bloated, stomach aches, acid, heartburn), and she had me set on the bed and she felt my stomach. The doc concluded that I had gastritits and she persrcibed 14 pills of 20 mg omeprazole(or prilosec in  the states) and she said to take them for the next for days until it went away. Anway so I took 2 omeprazoles yesterday(one in the morning and one in the evening) because I was in horrible pain.....  and eventually by around 8pm all the pain went away, but I was left feeling nauseous....      Sorry im rambling here.... anyway so I woke up today... this was all yesterday... and I feel great. I do realize that I should avoid acidy foods for a while just to be safe. But should I take a omeprazole today, even tho im feeling fine?       The doctor handed me a leaflet about peptic ulcers.... and warned me that if it happend again I might have to consider getting checked out for stomach problems...      Anway I have 12 pills of Omeprzole left, I feel fine, and I will avoid acidy foods for a few days.... should I finish off the remaining pills(or some of them/ one a day), or should I just avoid foods that will upset my stomach for now, and just ease back into a regular eating habit.... or both...

I am not quite sure as too what is goin on with me, all I know is I am starting to panic real bad and I am holding it in so my kids wont see. I have been for about 4-5 years had a slight sensation, more of a just very faint pressure about 1-2 in down under right breast and it kinda flows around to side, well past couple of months it seems to be more burning sensation, and occasionally like i have a pin pokin me in side. Now also my right shoulder blade seems to have a constant tingly sensation kinda like when your leg falls asleep, and that is running up into top of shoulder and into arm and also down side of my back. SOMETIMES not always but when i take a deep breath under right shoulder blade kinda hurts. I have gone and had gallbladder ultrasound done and they said it was normal. I had an H-pylori test where they check for cancer causing bacteria and it was normal, and they also checked my liver, kidneys, sodium , red blood cells and white and all of this was normal. Oh and everytime i take deep breath or stretch my back seems to be always popping. I guess I am hoping for a little piece of mind before i go to dr again. Thanks so much

20090220061943AAeZKSM	Health;Diet & Fitness	Stretch marks on my calf muscles even though i exercise?	I'm 14 and i am 5 foot 7 tall and i weigh 120 pounds. The country i originate from are home to tall, well built people, hence my height and weight, so i'm not bothered about it. Plus the rest of my family are built like this too.       I play sports often and i go on my pedal machine at my gran's house everyday for 30 minutes. It's just one of those exercise machines that you sit on and pedal your legs, like a bike. I also eat healthily and drink a lot of water.       Anyway, yesterday i was examining the calf muscle area on my legs, and i noticed two, thin, fairly small silvery white lines and my right leg. I checked my other leg and sure enough, i had another similar line, just this time there was one and it was much more shorter. When i run my fingers over them, they are slightly indented into my skin.       I think they may be stretch marks, but i'm confused. I know stretch marks are a red colour at first, and then they fade into a silver colour, but why are there only three of them and they are very small, barely noticeable? They are slightly more obvious in natural light, but you can't see them in artificial light. I've never noticed them before. Now i have two conclusions as to why i have them, if they are stretch marks:       a) A growth spurt triggered the stretch marks a while ago. I'm tall for my age, and iv'e had huge growth spurts since i was a kid till i was 13 and a half. Iv'e stopped growing now, which may be why the marks have faded. Plus, my legs have always been much longer than the upper part of my body.   b) Muscle build in my calf muscles due to exercise. Since august last year, i took up another sport which involves a lot of footwork, and i started using the pedal machine everyday in january - perhaps a lot of leg exercise has muscled up my calfs, but the skin couldn't keep up and instead stretched?

I can't even take deep breathes, walk, sit normally, and do regular tasks without pain. I used to exercise every day 5 months ago but now i do it once every two weeks. Is it because i lost muscle mass? I tried to massage it with a vibrating/heating device, hand message and even a hot bath which did not help at all.

20090220050628AAbWDtK	Health;Diet & Fitness	Feel Stressed Post Weight Training - Maybe Maffetone instead?	I am considering switching from my current training using just free weights to something a bit less intense like Maffetone. I have trained for years a few days per week just with free weights but I have found that in the last couple of years I have felt tired and or feel stressed out a few hours following training with weights. The stressed out feeling often continues for a couple of days. I have experimented with cutting down on the intensity of my workouts and this seems to help quite a bit but recently I was shocked when I took a heart rate measurement after what I thought was a relatively easy set of shoulder press and had a heart rate of 150 bpm. I am 40 years old, a guy 10 years older than me done the same and his heart rate was only 105. I asked him what training he did most of the time and he told me that it was mainly aerobic runnning type stuff. After this, I think maybe I need to cut out the weight training and shift to something low intensity to build up some aerobic fitness.      Can anyone suggest a sensible training regime for me. I stumbled on a couple of articles by a guy called Maffetone which looked sensible but there was not information regarding how long to exercise and how many days per week?      Thanks

I am worried that she does not have the necessary nutrients she needs in order for her to grow (doctors have said that she will indeed grow quite a bit more). She has expressed her concern about her thighs, and wants to try and lose some 'weight' in that area thus the reason for exercise and a 'healthy' diet. However she has explained to me that she is always hungry, and is trying to 'control' her hunger. Does anybody have any suggestion as to whether i should pack some biscuits for her for snack time at school? In addition, is there a better method to help her lose her thigh weight without having her to feel the need to control her diet? Also is she doing enough exercise?

20090220063623AAPeFm9	Health;Mental Health	Is there such a thing as compulsive grooming?	I have this terrible OCD problem where I constantly feel the need to groom. If I am not rubbing the mole on my cheek, I am biting at my nails or searching my hair for split ends. I even lay in bed at night and thing about the need to groom. If I get a pimple on my face, I scratch at it until it scabs over, and then I scratch at the scab constantly until it somehow manages a moment to heal. Is there anyone else that has these sort of problems? I am finding some information on the internet about it, but I would like to hear what other people have obsessed over.
20090220063702AA5F8K1	Health;Women's Health	My period is very light this month. Anyone know what would cause this?	I have a normal. It's usually every 28 days. It typically lasts 4 days. The first day it is light, then the second & third it is heavy and the fourth it is very light. Well, I got it this Tuesday and today is Friday, which is the fourth day. It has been pretty much light flow the entire time. The blood was a little dark in color on Wednesday, but other than that, just light red. The flow is very light. Although I've been changing my 'protection' whenever I go to the restroom, I've only actually needed to change it once per day. Could I be going through the change of life? (I'm 29.) What could cause this to happen?      I also wanted to mention that I am not on birth control pills, or medication. My husband and I use VCF vaginal insert contraceptives.

20090220064847AAo2Uvt	Health;Women's Health	This may sound like a stupid question...?	Well... I lost my virginity at 16, but I wasn't in a relationship with the guy. BUT he was my best friend, and we loved eachother as friends, and decided that we wanted to lose it with one another because we knew the other one was clean and all that. Is that wrong? I've never known how to feel about it, and I'm now 17 and a half, and I haven't had sex sinse because I still worry that I'm too young. Although in the UK most people have lost it by and around 16 anyway. But I'm in a relationship with a boy at the moment who's almost 18, he's a virgin, and would never pressurise me into anything, but I know it will come with the relationship if we fall in love. I'm not a christian and so I have no fixed "rules" so to speak, and I was just wondering if I could get some honest opinion.

Here is my problem: I can go two day without getting sick, but by the end of the second day I'm extremely bloated in the belly area & it really hurts.  I've tried baths/ showers, over the counter meds, doctor prescribed meds, walking & other similar things; nothing has worked. In addition, the scale usually tells me that I've gained 10 - 15 lbs in those few days! I know that doesn't seem possible, but that's what it reads. I tried to put on my regular pants this morning & they don't come anywhere close to fitting!  That just throws me back into the bulimia routine. What can I do?  I want to get better, but can't handle the weight gain. I fear I will just keep gaining until I am over weight again. How do I get the pain & bloating to go down in the tummy?

20090220072719AA9gcJw	Health;Other - Health	Is taking ex-lax tablets once a week really all that bad?	Every Tuesday night i pop two ex-lax pills. I've been doing this for a good couple months. I'm not irregular. I go at least once a day if not more. I eat plenty of fiber. I do it because i'm trying to maintain my weight. Every Wednesday of every week i weigh myself and i take the laxatives the night before because i don't want a false reading. My digestive tract seems to be doing just fine. I take a regular strength laxative so i never get any painful cramping and i'm not on the toilet all day because of it. I take it because i don't want some built up poo to add to my weight. My boyfriend the other night started telling me that it's dangerous and i've become dependent on them. But like i said i have no problem going on my own. Why don't i just wait for it to happen naturally and then weigh myself? Because i like to get it done first thing in the morning before i eat or drink. I mean, c'mon how bad could it be? I have MS and am currently on a medication that has been shown to cause an incurable fatal brain infection. What's some whacked out bowels?
