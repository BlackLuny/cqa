20090128212112AACtabA	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I requested Mormon missionaries to come to my house, but it has a strong odor of cigarette smoke, what to do?	I'm a 17 year old female and interested in the LDS church. My parents are Christians though they haven't been to church in years. They are fine with my interest in the Mormon religion and accept the fact that missionaries will soon be coming to my door.      The thing is that I'm embarrassed to let ANYONE into my house due to the fact that my parents chain-smoke inside; doors closed and everything.   I know that Morons are against tobacco so I don't want to let them inside and smell the smoke, but I also don't want to come inside as rude. It also is a little cold here too.      What can I do? Would you feel it was rude just to close the door behind me and speak with them outside?

20090128213400AAb2iOa	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	I am going to be bold here and well, here it goes?	Guys, I am a Black male (well 50 percent Japanese too) that has officially decided that he loves White girls. I have been with Black girls, Mixed Girls, and Hispanic girls. I would love to be with an Asian girl but so far, I will say that White girls make good lovers.      This is what I look like     http://i468.photobucket.com/albums/rr49/...       and the girl I am with currently is a Blonde girl (yea I know here come the stereotypes) who is intelligent. Now, I cannot post her pics on here because most of the pics she sent me, well, they would probably get my account suspended if I posted them on here.      Most Hispanic girls I was with were conceited and really got mad when things did not go their way,       BUT YA KNOW PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE. We are all the same color and all have the same taste.         I like White girls and I am a Black male saying this so here are my questions         1. Will I get shot if I said this in real life?      2. Is it irregular for a Black male to like White girls?      3. Is a Black male turning his back on his type if he likes White girls more than Spanish girls and Black girls?      A cousin of mines in the Bronx told me this, I decided to not even talk to him anymore.

He would have to do something really special to convince us he is the real deal, so what kind of magic tricks would he come up with?   Would he turn the sky green?   Would he fly like Superman?

20090128213412AAETNaH	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why's my boyfriend so abusive?	I've been with my boyfriend for 8 months now. I am gay, white and 20, and he is biracial (black/white), and 27, 28 in a couple of weeks. I've always had a thing for biracial men, and he is really hot and macho as well. I moved into his house 2 months ago.      The thing is though, for the last 3 or so weeks, he's been abusing me every now and then.      One example is the other day we went to the shops to get a new computer, and I was talking to the cashier guy, just friendly. But he overreacyed, and got jealous. When we got home he punched me on the face. He said if he ever saw me "flirting" (which I wasn't doing), with another man, he would kill me.      Also, a few days ago, he was in the shower, and I was getting a drink. I accidentally dropped the cup, and I tried to clean the floor before he'd realized. But next thing I saw him standing there stark naked and dripping wet. He told me if everything wasn't clean in 10 minutes, including the water on the floor from him dripping, he would belt me.      I don't mean to be racist, but is it because he is biracial,and thinks he can control me? Or because he's 8 years older than me? Both, or something else? I don't understand. I've met his parents, black father and white mother, and they're lovely.

Well, I have recently been spending alot of time, with a man who is 19 years older than me. He is 37, and I am 18.      I like him very much, and he likes me. We are still seeing other people, ans are not together.   He just broke up with his gf two days ago, and has been very sad about it. I have been talking to him everynight on the computer, just so he has some one to talk to. When we are together any other time, we have lots of fun.   I know that he has feelings for me, but I was just wondering, if you saw this large of an age difference what would you think.   I know that society frowns upon this, but I honetly don't care.   If when he feels comfortable dating again, if we went out. What would you think.   I am just asking to know, what regular people think about this large age difference.      If you are going to make rude comments, then don't bother answering.
20090128221109AAPdKWC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I wish I could like guys again?	I'm bi...and I love women, don't get me wrong. I think we're beautiful and sensual people with lovely minds and bodies. I thought I was straight for so long - despite having girl crushes at my all-girls high school, I still liked boys too - and when I got to college, I was looking for a boyfriend. I had a whole daydream of the new boyfriend I would find...so yeah, guess how shocked I was when I fell for a girl. Since then my life has not been the same. It didn't work out between us, 'cuz I have issues, and she doesn't go to the same school anymore and I miss her and I can't get myself to like ANYONE - boy or girl. I've had crushes on boys and girls, but only mini-ones, nothing compared to  what her.       I feel like my life is ruined. I know it's not, but it just feels so lonely and weird. I almost wish I never met her...I just wanna like guys again (since they actually like me) and stop liking her because there's point and it's driving me crazy!

20090128222151AAf91zQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Help Christians, I'm having trouble understanding the concept of grace vs. works?	To illustrate my dilemma, I'll tell the story of two people I knew.      The first person is a proclaimed non believer.  However he is also a fine man. An eye surgeon who gives up his time to go less fortunate countries and remove cataracts and blindness from people who cannot afford it. He carried out his work for free. Ho died a few years ago but his legacy carries on.      The second person is a woman. Several years ago she abducted a thirteen year old school girl, to give to her boy friend for his birthday.      For the next two days the two of them tortured the little girl and carried out unspeakable acts upon her. They finished her off  by stabbed her multiple times and then carried out more acts upon her.      While she was in jail, she was never a model prisoner until she was dying. A christian preached to her and she became born again. She then told everyone how god had forgiven her and she was saved. She then died.      Both these people are real and known to me.      So is the woman in heaven and man gone the other way      Thanks

20090128222517AA2vuWz	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why are the British people mean towards others?	THE UK GOVERNMENT KILLED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN WITH OUT ANY REMORSE?   i am a US citizen. My ex wife is British citizen. I have two children. Several years ago, my ex wife's father passed away in the UK, and SHE WENT TO THE UK to mourn her father's death. She went back with my children with a return plane ticket for her and my children. My ex-wife stayed in the UK for over a year, and I thought she would come back to the USA. She did not and instead filed for divorce in the UK and got remarried. Her plan was to leave me for her boyfriend back in the UK when her father passed away because our marriage was an arranged marriage. I went through the USA children's affair and got legal representative . My ex wife would battle me with everything and she would do everything to prevent me from seeing my children. Las summer, the judge said there may be a possibility that the children can come to the United States to only visit, but my ex wife was adament against that. She got a cascaff involved in the case. The official UK male bashing organization against men. After battle the UK courts for 5 years, the UK judge rendered an order stating that I can never see my children again and I can not speak with them over the phone. He also said I can not appeal this decision. The basis of this decision is that the mother has manipulated my children to tell a UK CAFCASS social worker that they never want to see me again, and the judge complied with this. My son is 10 years old and my daughter is 7 years old. My ex wife married a fundamental muslim who is brainwashing my children, the UK courts just relinquished my of all human fundalmental rights as a father, and I feel my country the United States has betrayed me and has not done enough.      I pleas need help and I am in immense grieving pain. I feel as though the UK courts told me to think of my children as being dead because they wont let me call my children.       I never did anything to hurt my children and prior to this I had visited them several times through a court order and I was extra gentle and kind with my children , so this social report is fabricated with lies and deceit.      I need help from any American's that can help me bring back two American citizen children back home and unit them to there very sad father.      I am deeply hurting that I have not been able to get out of bed the last 48 hours. I am feeling really depressed , betrayed, hurt, and lied to. I do not know what to do and how can a judge do such a thing.      I m going to post this everyday until someone can help me...Ive called the media, an attorney, the district attorney's office, and left a message with my congress man. I am not giving up and I hope maybe someone reading this will give me good advice to get my children back      TO ALL WOMEN THAT HATE MEN OR SOMEHOW RELATE THIS STORY TO WHAT EVER EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT PROMPTS YOU TO LEAVE VERY HURTFUL AND NEGATIVE POSTS....I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE NEVER TO TAKE AWAY MY CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHER..MY INTENTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN..I STILL STAND BY THIS... BUT THE EX WIFE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFE AND WILL LIE AND DECIET ABOUT EVERYTHING...SHE IS TELLING MY CHILDREN THAT I AM NOT THE FATHER AND HER NEW HUSBAND IS THE FATHER....I JUST WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY ON MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY...MY CHILDREN ARE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN TO MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER IS LOSING HIS SIGHT AND I JUST WANT HIS TO SEE HIS GRANDCHILDREN BEFORE HE LOSES HIS SIGHT...      PLEASE ..I NEED HELP...AND FYI..I NEVER HIT MY EX WIFE OR DID ANYTHING ELSE...SHE LEFT ON HER OWN ACCORD...   16 minutes ago - 3 days left to answer.    Additional Details   0 seconds ago      I never hit my children...during the last 5 years that i visited my kids in the Uk ...we were starting to develop a relationship and i felt to ask the evil UK courts if my children can come to the united states to visit me....the judge orginally agreed with it...Remind you this happen last summer in 2008..I left and returned back to the USA ....while back home , my ex wife got a social worker involved and the social worker interviewed my children and submitted a report to the judge that stated my children hated me and hated the united states, the children were scared of me and did not want to see me any more....      i was shocked because when i left in the summer, my children were said i was leaving..      what happen my ex brainwashed my children to say that stuff to the social worker and she wrote it..and the social worker recommended that i never see the kids again...the judge agreed with the social worker and thus giving me a death sentence of never to never see my kids again

20090128220707AAJzhNq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: Do you believe someone when they tell you that they are a Christian?	In a conversation with someone you don't know well, if the person says that he is Christian, do you assume he is telling the truth, or that he is one of those who 'professes with his mouth to be Christian, but denies the fact with his deeds'?      I would have to fall into the group of people who is skeptical when someone claims to be a Christian, and has to wait for the person to *prove* it with their actions. And personally, I'd rather be the other way around, but this is just how it is for now.       So, what about with you?      Also, do you think there is a 'right' and 'wrong' concerning this matter?

So i want to buy my girlfriend something for Valentines day that will get her a break from the everyday, like a mini vacation, we are both in high school, so it cant be anything elaborate, i need it within reason, something so that she can get away from it all for like a day.

I have looked up many pictures of people kissing the Blarney Stone at the Blarney Castle, and everyone is laying down with their head hanging over a ledge, upside no less, and they kiss the stone.  It appears as though you can just walk up and touch/kiss it because it looks like it is just a huge wall.

20090128220756AAczSu3	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it rude to take someone up on their offer?	My question is about etiquacy or good manners. I often say to someone "Call me if you need anything", but common sense tells you not to call me if you need just anything. However, my current boss keeps offering me very nice insider bonuses. I've only worked for her for about 6 months, we get along great, and apparently she has great connections. I was looking at new I-Pods, she told me her brother works for the company and can get a discount. I need a book, she works for a company that gives her a discount. Now im sick, and she said if I need a prescription called in to just let her know because her dads a doctor. Ive never taken her up on her offers before, I dont want her to feel like Im mooching off of her. But is it bad manners to always decline when someone is trying to be helpful? Or would it be rude to actually take her up on this last offer? All perspectives are greatly appreciated... Thanks!

20090128221916AAw8uFh	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I'm gay and I love my best friend, WHAT SHOULD I DO?	I've been best friends with him for about 8 years now, and he doesn't know that i'm gay. I want to tell him so badly that i'm gay, to see if something will maybe happen if he knows im gay, but im afraid he wont want to be friends anymore. Sometimes I find us flirting together, and we share a bond that nobody really understands, and we've even kissed before. I'm getting mixed messages because he tells me he loves me all the time, but sometimes he seems somewhat homophobic and he has had a few girlfriends in the past. I'm starting to think he might not be comfortable with his own sexuality.This friendship is starting to cause me alot of pain, because i'm not sure if were more than just friends, and I don't wanna try anything funny because I don't want to lose him as a friend. I'm starting to debate on whether I should just tell him im gay, and if something happens it happens, and if he stops being friends with me...well then i guess he wasn't that great of a friend after all. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

20090225155054AAWzc3h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pagans; do you or anyone you know believe this?	When I was Pagan (Wiccan specifically), I knew more than a few other Pagans of various religions and paths that believed that we created the gods that have been worshiped throughout history. That instead of god(s) creating man or the gods just always having been here that people dreamed them up and years of believing in them, worshiping them, retelling their stories, etc. had, essentially, breathed them into life.       Does anyone else believe this or something similar? I'm just a tad curious. Feel free to answer if you aren't Pagan, I just never knew anyone other than Pagans who held this belief other than seeing something similar on a Jethro Tull album when I was a kid - "In the beginning, Man created God; and in the image of man..." - it was on the Aqualung album and I don't have any idea what Ian Anderson's religion is.

20090128231411AAP4Uvr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Repentance has nothing at all to do with the Crucifixion. Why do believers tie it to the Cross?	John the Baptist's baptism was called the "Baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins." That phrase indicates that repentance... and his baptism could forgive sins (and of course the water in Baptism is symbolic of that kind of cleansing)      And Christ himself was asking people to "Repent," just like John.      But this was all going on long before the Crucifixion, which means that the Baptism and the Repentance they were talking about had nothing at all to do with the Crucifixion.       So why do "believers" make the connection between believing that Christ died for our sins to Baptism and Repentance when both Jesus and John made no such connection?      (The above question is from the Enigma e-book if you want to see the complete context.  http://gospelenigma.com  )

One day my neighbor and I were enjoying ourselves with beer and peanuts out on my back patio....All of a sudden a big cloud of white smoke with the most disgusting foul smell came over the fence. We both hit the back lawn with our guts wrenching and nausea. I finally got composed and hopped up to the fence just in time to see the Asian Father using a propane torch to burn the hair off some type of animal. As my eyes stopped watering and cleared up, I saw it was a long haired dog, type unknown. The head was off of it and the BBQ skewer was already through it's body...I was totally disgusted. My friend and I called the local authorities (SPCA) and they intern responded and confiscated the semi burned up dog. Was I wrong in doing this....should I accept this custom??

(We're all on good terms and I speak to them on myspace every now and then.) I have lots of friends I'm more comfortable with back home, but I rarely get to hang out with them in person. In school I say hi to everyone and everybody generally likes me (I don't know anyone that hates my guts), so it's not a social problem, altho I admit that I can be shy.      But now I'm mostly chillin' by myself on the weekends and such, which I'm finding that I enjoy. I enjoy writing (my dream/hobby), surfing the internet, playing the guitar, watching movies, and listening to music in peace--things that are done alone mostly. I know that I could easily be social by drinking and smoking like everyone else does, as it is the college thing, but that would feel fake. And besides, I'm too focused on school to party, and I'm not close to anyone that's in my school to go to a party like that, (to me everyone is an accuaintance) not like I really care if I don't go.      Wherever I go, I always get "you should go out more" or "stop being a hermit". Lately it's gotten worse. People I just don't click with tell me I should go do stuff with them, and one girl even shoved pot in my face and tried to get me to smell it. And it pisses me off. If a true friend or lover crosses my path, I will never walk out on them. I give people chances, and I don't judge others before getting to know them. But for now I'm not afraid to stand alone.        I don't know, I guess I'm just different...or am I weird?

I really feel like I was born into the wrong family, it's killing me. I'm puerto rican and I absolutely LOVE being puerto rican. I am so proud of it, and I love the culture, and I love the exotic features that go with being a puerto rican.      My family on the other hand, it's like they're soo ashamed of it. I've never seen anything like it. They try to hide it. Worst of all, they make me feel awkward if I ever want to show it off (which is not very often, but for example, I put the flag in my window and they took it down)      My parents were both born in PR, speak fluent spanish, but never taught me or my brother how to speak spanish, or dance to spanish music. My dad even dropped a few letters on his last name so its no longer a spanish last name, and my parents also made sure to give me the most americanized first name they could. My brother indentifies himself as being white, he's called himself white on so many occasions. He's also very racist against other spanish people, he only likes spanish people who look and identify themselves as being white, otherwise he doesn't like them.      It's not like they would have experienced EXTREME racism, my parents both have light skin, straight hair, blue/green eyes, and it's not like were illegal immigrants anyway, puerto ricans are US citizens.      It makes me HATE them with a passion. I hate looking at them most of the time. I know I wrote a lot, but I just don't know what to do about it, I try to ignore it, but like I said, it really kills me inside.       No joke answers please <3

20090128230623AAGCd51	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is it wrong to trust people?	I am a very trusting person and I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and it usually ends up coming back and biting me in the butt.  Hard.  For example my co-worker who I worked closely with, I trained her to be a co-manager and we got along great.  I made a poor choice at work and she told the boss and I got fired.  I didn't ask her to keep it quiet because nothing bad came from it, the situation was fixed right after I corrected myself, so I figured we would keep it between us.  I was wrong.  A similar thing has happened in the past.        In a management position, I feel that the best way to get people to respond to you is for you to have trust in them to do what is expected of them.    I put trust in people because that's the only way I know how to be but why am I being penalized for it?  Is it wrong to trust people to treat you as you would them?
20090128223703AAbIvgJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A deciphering of Daniel's 4 beast question?	I have been wondering for the longest time what the 4 beasts in Daniel represent and I think I have cracked the code.      Mind you all the empires speak for empires not immediately after Daniel as many scholars have thought like Persians,Alexander the great and Rome but they speak more generally for empires of all time.      The first empire/beast the lion with wings that stands up like a man ...is empire through kingship.We know that from Neolithic times there have been chiefs and kings that ruled the people of the world,be it the Near east,Africa,Far East or the New world. World over the empires had one characteristic and that was a sovereign ruler (some even  with divine status).So the lion represents the rule from above by kings, however the fact that the lion stands like a man is a direct indication that rule from above would be replaced by rule from below.      This is directly linked to the second empire/beast the bear that raised itself up on one side.It represents the common man, ever since the 18th century the world was beginning to change with people becoming emancipated from serfdom,slavery and generally monarchy.Through the American revolution and the French revolution people became more and more determined to rule by their own choice and not decree. In the 19th century the revolutions of 1830,1848 and unification of European states speaks of that trend carrying on. Affairs began to be dictated from below not above by the plebiscite. The best example is the Russian revolution of 1917 and follow on decolonisation of the 3rd world through socialist revolutions and populism.      The 4th beast is where we are now, it represents a synchronisation or globalisation of the world.One could argue this began in earnest during Napoleon's conquest of Europe but especially after his defeat of by a coalition of leaders in Europe who saw to internationalise politics at the Congress of Vienna(1815), but the full effect was not seen till the League of Nations and the United Nations. Moreover the 4th beast is represented as a leopard having spots and four heads and 4 wings on one body this is exactly the world we live in now. Benelux lead to the EU(a politically united Europe), OECD,G8,OPEC, ASEAN are just a few examples of economic power blocs not to mention others like the Arab league..anyway main point is this is a global trend to a cosmopolitan empire of many individual identities unified under one common purpose.      We are yet to enter into the 4th empire but my guess is it will be more unified and monolithic than its predecessor.It could really be the one world government..it just looks inevitable.Though I think it's still a century away.      What do you think of this?

When asked if they thought that the apocalypse would occur in 2012         Yes i do. It has to do with the mayan calendar and the way the stars are aligning on the calender. It was also one of the very many predictions made by the late great Nostradamus (who had the very date when someone would dig up his grave enscribed on his skull after his death). He also said that there would be great wars, polictical issues, and natural disasters leading up to this. But anyway, the way the stars are aligning hasnt happened for millions of years. Last time they formed exactly like this, millions and millions of years ago. And exactly what happened? Nothing big, just wiped out almost every species. So yes i do believe that we all die in 2012.

In our American society there seems to be an obsession with activity, we are always running to and from never giving a moment to relax, slow down, and enjoy life!      I know this is a generalization, but I think is an observation that largely holds true.  Why is it that so many feel the need to be constantly busy?  Certainly there is more to life than running around mindlessly, going to work, buying things, sleeping, then getting up and doing it again ad infinitum!

20090128230320AA8mXEg	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is this descrimination in school?	In kindergarden going into the first grade my little 6 year old brother is going into this private schools where most people are white and although he has brown/blonde hair he is still latino. In the middle of the year my parents had a conference with his teachers about him and they pretty much tolled him that he wasn't keeping up with the group, that he was too shy( because he didn't talk much in class), and was slow at reading. So my parents got him a tutor which was a 1 grade teacher from another school. They meet for about 4 hours a week and in about a month he started reading really well. We were already scared that they would kick him out of the school, because the year before that they had already kick another latino boy out of the school and to be frank I knew this little kid and he was by far the most energetic, smart, and fun kid in his class but even through that they still kicked him out. My parents and the little kids parents were friends so it was pretty hard for us to hear that this little boy was not going to attend the school anymore. Anyway my mother got a call this morning requesting her to meet with the kindergarden principle and she got pretty scared. After school when my mom when to pick up my little brother she spoke with the teachers and they pretty much tolled her that they taught my little brother was getting better but my mother keep asking "but theirs got to be something else to it because the principle wants to meet with me", so they tolled my mom that the principle would tell her...   Thats at the point we are in right now.   now some things to consider-   1. reading isnt a requirement to get into the first grade   2. My little brother is reading and he has had multiple test that the school requested and he passed them.   such like - psychological and some others I don't remember.   3. Isnt it a little too late in the school year to tell someone that their not doing well.   4. He's really smart in math, he's bilingual and he can say the alphabet backwards (in a song)   4. Isnt it the teachers duty to teach every child in the classroom and if someone is falling behind, then to help them.    Example: As a doctor would you let a patient die, if he wasn't making progress.       PLease respond and give me perspectives

But the other night I was at my boyfriends place. We had just come home and were chilling on the couch. As I do sometimes, I put my legs on his lap. I was wearing brown high heeled knee high boots that night. He started rubbing my leg, unzipped them and took them off for me. At first I blushed at little because I had on these white socks with a pink heel and toe but he just smiled, took them off and chucked them aside. We've been going out for 8 months and this is the first time hes done it. Im probably being paranoid but have others experienced anything similar with their bf's?

20061023014731AAoW9mc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Love and marriage?	Love is life for man and love is everything in this world. It is love that shines brilliantly in every individual. But man, not being able to comprehend the significance of love attributes physical relationship to it. The love of a mother towards her child is affection. The love that exists between wife and husband is infatuation. The love that exists among friends and relations is attachment. The love towards material objects is desire. Love in totality, directed towards God is known as devotion. (Sri Sathya Sai Baba, Guru Poornima Discourse, Aug. 3, 1999)          Marriage means your whole life, a whole lifetime together, not just a few days, or a few weeks, or a few years. (Golden Age, pp. 140-143)

I've never donated blood before, but there's a blood drive going on at my school and I want to give it a shot.  I tried today, but while I was answering all the health questions, I guess I got so nervous that I broke out in a cold sweat and started feeling really sick.  I had to put my head down for a while until I felt better so I could finish answering them.        I hadn't eaten anything all day, but I wasn't feeling all that hungry, and didn't even have hunger shakes yet.  I know that's an important thing to do before you give blood, but I'm wondering if maybe it was the finger prick they do beforehand that made me feel so woozy, or if it was the blood-pressure machine?        Does anyone have any tips that'll keep me from feeling and looking totally sick before I give blood?  I really want to do it, and I don't have any diseases or anything, so I know that's not a problem.  Is it just that I hadn't eaten enough that day?

Does this sound like the hardship we all go through and about the middle east? The ground is cursed because of our first Parents.  Just think about it; we have thorns and thistles growing every where and God said it would happen and yet we all were blind and we could not see and we were death and could not hear to believe his words to our Parents.       A reading from the 3rd Chapter of Genesis: "Because you have done this, you shall be banned from all the animals and from all the wild creatures.  On your belly shall you crawl, and dirt shall you eat all the days of your life.  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; He will strike at your head, while you strike at his heel."      To the woman he said: "I will intensify the pangs of your childbearing; in pain shall you bring forth children.  Yet your urge shall be for your husband, and he shall be your master."      To the Man he said: "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat, "Cursed be the ground because of you!  In toll shall you eat its yield all the days of your life.  Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to you, as you eat of the plants of the field.  By the sweat of your face shall you get bread to eat.  Until you return to the ground, from which you were taken; For you are dirt, and to dirt you shall return."

Since Mohamad claimed to be the comforter...and said he got his comfort from his over 10 wives, including his best wife a 9 year old little girl Aisha, but his followers could only have 4 wives, and the wives could only have one husband who is muslim.

Jesus said to love your enemies, Mohamad said to destroy them and in one place to cut off their hands.    Mohamad said Jesus is the Messiah, and is returning how can Jesus be only a prophet? that is funny...is Mohamad returning? No      this question came from an answer in my question about who does Isaiah 53 talk of, one muslim answered saying....we dont read the bible and Mohamad is the comforter Jesus promised;      in past i would select a diverison of answers      now its simply all in the Bible and songs about the bible      God authored the bible   John 1:1 In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God and the Word was God   John 1:16 "And the Word became flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld the glory of the only begotten son."      i like other books and songs too, but the best is the bible      it's author is my best friend   and Acts 29 is my life...it isnt written in the bible...it is a continuation and i sing for Jesus wherever i go, and new souls come to Jesus too!      its the most exciting life       and once I had all the world had to offer and i was going to commit suicide, which would have been the sadest ending to any book because as the bile says i would have been in hell weeping forever for rejecting the salvation and love of Jesus. Matthew 24      as a Jew and it is summed up in my last question or 2 questions ago from the prophecy of Isaiah 53      Help! Isaiah 53 Who is the prophecied one to be rejected and lays down his life as a lamb to forgive sins?   Who do you think this Scripture is talking about????      I am born Jewish and given a copy of our Tenach for my Bar Mitzvah   I AM TOLD I CAN BE AN ATHEIST AND STILL JEWISH, OR believe as some Orthodox Jewish do that Rabbi Schneerson was the Messiah, and still be Jewish, yet if I believe as my Yiddish Bubbie/grandma from Boston does that Yeshua/God is salvation/Yesus from the GReek=Jesus is the Messiah then I change and am not Jewish anymore= I change from having a Jewish mom to having a gentile mom?      Isaiah written 700 Bc/e before the coming of the gentiles Messiah Cristos/Christ from the GReek meaning the anointed one   Isaiah 42:1 says he will be a light to the gentiles.      Who could this be....   Isaiah 52:13 says "He will be exalted and made very high"    14 He was marred more than any man   Kings will believe in him   Isaiah 53 Who has believed the report of the Lord? He will show His arm unto us   He will be despised and rejected    He will lay down his life as a lamb, to make atonement for our sins   he will die with the wicked and be burried with the rich   He will see his seed and prosper (last verse of Isaiah chapter 53)      JEWISH ONCE SAID IT WAS THE MESSIAH   today in true form they mostly say it is Israel... when did Israel reject and despise itself, get marred more than any man, lay down its life innocent for its own sins, die with the wicked and get burried with the rich, see it's own seed spiritually and prosper after dying?      MUSLIMS say that Jesus is the Messiah, born of a virgin, lived sinless, and rose to heaven...that he didnt ever die, another took his place on the cross...making his mother crying at the cross...over the wrong person dilusional? and as she said "Behold my savior and my God." John's gospel....   MUSLIMS SAY that the Jewish people tampered and changed the bible (yet why would they PUT THIS IN ABOUT HIM DYING FOR THEIR SINS?..AND not remove it rather than put this in, as it is so obviously pointing to......would those who despise and reject add this? the one that Muslims say is the Messiah coming back to earth=clue it is not Mohamad)      ATHEISTS could you predict what will happen in 700 years... like this?      "Unto us a child is born a son is given, and he is mighty God, wonderful in counsel, the everlasting father and the prince of peace." Isaiah 9:6         MOSES SAID "Without the shedding of blood (blood sacrifice innocent for our guilt) there is no forgiveness of sins." Leviticus 17:11      some say Judaism accepted the Messiah, and those that didnt made a new religon, rejecting Moses and the Messiah and making their own rules for forgiveness of sins...prayers, alms and whatever       the reason for this was the completion and fulfiment of Jeremeiah 31:30 and following verses   "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, NOT LIKE THE ONE I MADE WITH MOSES, AND you shall be m

20090128204537AAULIjk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians only please?	I say Christian only because I want the thoughts of people who follow Christianity :)      I believe in God, I have been introduced to Christianity by my fiancees family. I love the religion, I can't say I'm converted, but I want to say that so you understand I mean no disrespect or "harm" by my questions, I just have a very inquisitive mind.      I just read an article about scientists that did experiments on sheep (I am including a link, but this wasn't the exact article I read).  They altered some factors in the womb on pregnant sheep, for example testosterone levels, and found that it changed the brain chemistry of these sheep, causing them to only try to mate with the same sex, and show no interest in the opposite sex. There were plenty of other things they did, but I'm not going to get too deep into that.       Basically my point and questions is this-If it can be proved that homosexuality is caused by abnormalities in the womb, then what does that say about homosexuals going to hell?  I mean, if it is truly something "wrong" with gay people can they still be condemned? To me that would be like saying people with Down Syndrome are just going to hell, and that is obviously unfair....Right? What are your thoughts?  Also, the article I read included the moral issues with this study, which the link I provided doesn't talk about-if you knew by a test at something like 12 weeks pregnant that there was a high probability that your child would be born gay, then that gives you the opportunity to abort...Now as a Christian, I know you don't believe in abortion, but you would also believe that your child was going to be condemned, so what are your thoughts on that?  (Please, please no rants on abortion either way)      Sorry to talk about so many controversial things, and I don't mean to offend anyone, I just want some thoughts on that. A big reason for my question is that I know someone I love in my family is gay, and every time my fiancees family starts talking about gays going to hell I want to scream because it really hurts me.      Thanks in advance.         Here is the link:         http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.S._study_o...        http://www.gazettetimes.com/articles/200...

20090129013543AArqXFt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How you can explain DNA with Darwin's evilution theory?	THE DEVICE IN YOUR BODY THAT CAN COPY A MILLION PAGES OF INFORMATION IN TWENTY MINUTES        http://www.harunyahya.com/books/science/...       It's long been known that cells multiply by division. During this process, the DNA found in the nucleus of each cell needs to be copied for each new "daughter" cell. During this process of replication, an amazing event takes place that requires consideration.       DNA's data bank, made up of three billion letters, is able to store massive amounts of information concerning the living organism. To write down all the information contained in DNA would require an encyclopaedia of approximately 1,000 volumes, with a total of a million pages. Therefore, the replication of DNA and the copying of a million-page encyclopaedia are comparable. But do you know how long this process of DNA replication takes?       Between 20 and 80 minutes!      Now, that means that the equivalent of one million pages of writing can be copied, with no mistakes or deficiencies, in a period of less than two hours—and sometimes, under a half hour.  No photocopier or any other technological device available today can complete this copying process faultlessly, in such a short period of time. And consider that no technological machines are carrying out this process, but cells that we cannot even see with the naked eye. Now ask yourself:      Who possesses the power and mind, will and knowledge to bring about this amazing organization? What realizes that the DNA must be copied when a cell divides? What brings about this replication in the fastest, most perfect way, and which allows for any mistakes to be fixed immediately?      Clearly, it's illogical and senseless to claim that this whole complex, faultless and perfect system came about as a result of coincidence. Bring together all of the atoms in the universe, under the proper conditions, and still you won't be able to create the system that carries out the replication of DNA in every living organism.      It is quite obvious that the One Who created this perfect system, Who has continued to create it for millions of years is God, the Possessor of infinite knowledge, consciousness, and power.

There are so many references to the Bible whereby Jesus and many others instruct us to look after them? What's stopping you from being a cheerful giver?      There shouldn't be anyone suffering from poverty because we have more than our basic needs living in western countries, especially.      We're Christians. We represent Him. We need deeds so that people may listen and see how distinct we are from the rest of the world; most importantly to serve God and the people. We're humliating Jesus's name when we only use words to profess His name. It's time we show compassion and love towards the needy. It may be physically and emotionally.      1. Being generous to Christian agencies. Tear Australia, Christian Blind Mission etc.   2. Two people in your life. Care and love them.   3. Think carefully about advancing the Kingdom of God through work/job. Be the best Christian at your occupation.   4.Think carefully about where you live. Not necessary to live in an expensive area.   5. Think about your country of origin. Be informed. Research.   6. Be Christian voters. Choose leaders who strive for justice.   7. Think about your church. Fundraising, Letters to the PM, hampers, settting up a free food stand for the poor, visting nursing homes.      There are so many ways. We're helping the poor and needy to serve God and His people. Nothing more, nothing less.      Don't be embarassed and say you've done nothig. Admit it and be active, again. We are blessed by God so much; that we should share willingly and compassionately. :)   Are you actively helping those less fortunate...?

According to the Christian bible( belief ) there was a big flood, before that there was no big ocean instead there was really large rivers.

(I think I need to warn people) Only if you are not weak minded (spiritually and intellectually) should one watch zeitgeist. If you are dumb you going to be confused.   One of the examples used in the movie is that Christian beliefs can be traced back to Egyptian beliefs and many others.   I found myself thinking about that. Why are there similar stories to Jesus’? Like Horus.  That got me thinking; in the Old Testament it predicts Jesus’ life.  So what makes the writers of the zeitgeists movie think that all those other accounts that is similar to Jesus’ life is nothing more than a prediction of Jesus’ life?    Are all the stories that are similar to Jesus’ life all just predictions like in the Old Testament? How can my theory be disproved?      Sinner the Agnostic

Then it went further, he said his mother was on borderline of telling my mother that we have had sexual relations before unless Josh follows her rules. Josh can only see me at School or Youth group from now on and never on weekends, never on sleep overs, no birthdays, nothing...   I've just been put on recently on anti-depressants and am already finding it hard without them... My father screams all the time and is doing it right now arguing with my mother... The school has gotten harder and more strict with rules, haircuts and everything else... I'm about to break, I can feel my chest getting tighter which means I'm on borderline panic attack... I'm shaking almost... And I don't know what to do, this is only going to get worse and worse and Josh won't be here to support me... The only thing I can think of right now is just running... and running... Now my parents are talking about Josh and my relationship...   All I could get out of Josh in his short time online was he's sorry... I believe he tried to come out to his mother telling her to back off from us, I knew that would be a bad idea. I should have told him sooner not to... ****, I need Josh right now my whole body is warm and shaking... my heart feels in my throat... and I can't see him again, for that support...

Now I'm not allowed contact to Josh and there goes my support, I should feel like ****... but all I see is... maybe there right...     I was just told to go do the dishes, I walk in and my fathers doing them and I say I was asked to do it. He told me he can trust himself to do it right and I can go off and do something else...    My friends 18th is coming up, I was asked not to get drunk by Josh... my mother yesterday before any of this came out, said I could... as long as I didn't come home drunk... I don't have Josh anymore, no matter what he says... we both know it's gone until we are much older, and I don't know how much will change then... CJU Forever, I hope...  Even my drama teacher said I was a rude selfish person and she won't put up with it... Maybe I am a jerk...  I care about people yes, I try and help people, always give up my time to solve their problems... But Josh, remember this... I told you when I first met you, everyone I've helped... every single one... Crashes, and it's all because of me...    "I'm like fire, beautiful and magical, I keep you warm and secure... but get to close and you get burned..."    I think I answered this question myself...

20090129021439AA6oVfc	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	What Mexican folklore is the scariest to you?	Being of Mexican ethnicity and living on the border, I guess I only know a little bit of Mexican Folklore stores. The ones that I am familiar with are:      La Llorana (The Crying Lady)- She threw her kids into the Rio Grande to please her male suitor and they drowned. He left her so she searches the waters of south texas and northern Mexico to find her kids and takes kids that are there after night fall.      El Chupacabra (The Goatsucker)- This is supposed to be like a hairless dog that sucks the blood out of goats and other livestock and farm animals and leaves no blood in the corpses, but leaves the corpses unmangled.      La Lachusa (The Owl)- This is supposed to be like a bird woman. It is supposed to be like the body of a giant owl with the head of a woman. And if you whistle at night she will whistle back and try to locate  you to scratch your eyes out.      Those are the only ones that I know of. Are there any that you know? If not, which is the scariest to you. To me, it La Llorona.

20090129024809AA7QkV9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are people singling out amputees?	While I understand having one or more less limbs is a truly horrible way to live, so is living with cancer, Aids, or living in extreme poverty........    If God were to heal amputees, why shouldn't He heal cancer, Aids etc. and remove people's poverty?    If He does one of these, He has to do the other, and can you imagine how things would turn out then?    For example, people will smoke and drink like hell, and if they get lung cancer, God will magically heal it. People will do all sorts of crazy stunts and if it leads to the loss of one limb, God will magically regrow it.    So there's no reason to care for your health, your limbs etc anymore because God is there to fix it 24/7. Get it?

I.e 19 and her, in her 30's?	We've known each other for 4 years, I eventually spilled my guts at the end of last year to her and she didnt reject me but she trivialised everything and she is in a long-term relationship...and so we ended very friendly like.. we saying I actually do love you and her hugging me saying I was a sweetheart. She is much older than me, it does sound like it doesnt it? Im 19 and she's in her early 30s. I know, but we are both mentally on the same level. Nways my question is about last night...please can you help decrypt this for me:      We are both debating coaches and had training last night...new year, new league etc etc.   Sooo I came into training a little late, she looks at me, and her eyes sort of lingered on what I was wearing, then she didnt look at me after that. I said hello to everyone I knew, but she was talking to another adjudicator (debating judge/coach term) and so I couldnt interrupt, after all I have immense respect for her. All I wanted was a friendly convo...like last year you know?       But she didnt even speak to me. Then she leaves half way through the training!! What on earth...why would she do that? Is it simply because she was "feeling ill" as someone told me...? Or is it becuase on that level (now that Im an adjudictor and not a "student") does she think we cant have a frienly platonic relationship? I mean I thought we got over it?      Im seeing her next week, what must I say? Any help would be soooo fantastic...please....      I was the one who said, "I know you cant admit anything...but have a good holiday"      and then she hugged me and said "your a sweetheart"      Then I ran after her and said "actually I do love you.."    and she looked at me and we both laughed and said nothing and I left. Just happy I had got it out and NOTHING COULD HAPPEN. And Ive tried to move on.

These aren't women looking to go home with other women, but making a scene to get the attention of men.

Just to start off I'm completely fine with LGBT people and do not have a problem at all with them.       ...Over the last couple of months one of my best friends became really close to this bi girl at her work. Should I mention she is 16 and the other girl is 18. They became so close that eventually me and all her other really good friends were in a way rejected and we dont really contact her anymore.       My (ex)best friend was the kind of girl who had never been into girls and was pretty innocent and very close to her family. On the other hand the other girl (the bi one) was quite the opposite. One of my other good friends who is till quite good friends with my (ex)best friend asked her why she lets the bi girls kiss her and she simply said "because I dont know what to do when she does it".       So my so called (ex) best friend who was really close to her family recently moved out of her family home because of a disbute with her family not liking the bi girl etc and is now pretty much completely disconnected from her family. The bi girl has really brought my friend away from her family. My friend now lives with the bi girl and is trying to receive funds from the govt to pay for school which is kind of strange since she came from a very wealthy family.       In a way I think the bi girl is selfish for letting my friend be disconnected from all her friends and take her away from her family like she did. The bi girl is quite mean to us and doesnt let my friend hang out with us.       ..They sleep in the same bed.

20090129010628AAxrd6R	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	At best, wasn't Jesus simply mistaken?	In Matthew 16:28, Jesus tells his disciples: "There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming into his kingdom."    Also, in Mark 13, Jesus speaks of the signs indicating of his imminent return, i.e. "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in diverse places, and there shall be famines and troubles" (Mark 13:8). Also, "And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory" (Mark 13:26). Then in Mark 13: 30, he says "Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done."     Two millenia later, we're still waiting... Note that he's not talking about the Resurrection, and these verses are widely quoted as signs of the apocalypse. How do Christians make sense of Jesus' non-return when he clearly said he'd return to Earth within a lifetime/generation?    Wasn't Jesus simply mistaken?

20090129014952AAK4jP7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Questions about Jesus Christ?	You know that Buddha and Mahavira DO NOT intention to create religion such as Buddhism and Jainism respectively. They just social protesters that created social organizations that are against the caste system of Brahmanism or Hinduism. They actually go to forests and jungles to meditate, where they asked if there are ways to salvation--they are tired of reincarnating, and tired of mere and severe social classifications in an Aryan society--where they also founded philosophies. During their time, they did not intend to create new religion, indeed, they are just philosophers that meditated and think thoroughly so much that they established great wall to philosophy of life. Their disciples then regarded them as supernatural being, Buddha and Mahavira became God, so new religion was established. Actually, they are just philosophers, and on their death, their philosophy was converted into divine words that finally sprang new religions, similar to Confucius.      Question is,      1. Is Jesus Christ was also a social protester like Buddha and Mahavira? We know that he is inclined away from the beliefs and traditions of the Jews that time, though he was a Jew. He do not want the attitude of the Pharisees and Sadducee, so He preached and preached that is against to syncretized Judaism. For example, He mentioned that some things that the Pharisees are doing is not based upon Moses' and Abraham's and other prophets' law.      Another, is He a social protester against Rome that time? I think no, because no Roman records mentioning Him still exists today. Maybe there were, but it did not manage to escape the fragmentation of time.      2. Throughout the Bible, Jesus did not command His disciples to create new religion and made Him as deity of the new founded religion. He does only said that spread the Word of God on every corners of the world. So is it reasonable that Jesus, actually is the founder of Christianity? Is it reliable if I say, St. Peter, regarded as first Pope, is the founder of Christianity? How?      3. Mahayana Buddhism told the existence of bodhisattvas. These are Buddhas (enlightened ones) that did not enjoy their nirvanas to go back to earth and save and help people to become Buddha too. If we apply Asian view into Christ's being, is ha a bodhisattva too?

I can't just stop dead in my tracks while I'm running and pull out my headphones, lol, that would just be awkward      I make eye-contact with him as I am running by... but I don't want to be too creepy and stare for too long.      I guess I'm a bit shy.      After my run, I was in the stretching room doing plank. When I was done, I looked up, and he was on the other side of the room, smiling at me. It seemed like he had probably been watching me do my plank the entire time.      I was a little flustered... I walked by him, I couldn't help but shift my eyes away, got a sip of water.. and then headed downstairs to the ladies locker.      I was just too shy to go up to him. Any advice on what to do, how, what to say, or even how to be more approachable?      Or am I doing it right and he should really just approach me (He's probably in his mid to late 20s, and I'm 20)

But also women. I don't know if I can be considered bi, because I've never really done more than kiss a girl, and it is more rarely that I am attracted to women. Although, I've had these 'rare cases' ever since I was in elementary school even!!      I'd like to know... How do I hit on a girl if I meet one that I'm attracted to? How to even know if she is open to that and won't be disgusted or something?      Help!
20090128234156AAIzs3V	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are most Americans intolerant towards that which is different?	I mean I cannot comprehend the sheer ignorance of most Americans in this country, and I see exactly why countries outside see us so cruelly.      Most Americans are ignorant of other religions, cultures, and traditions to the point that they are quite xenophobic. For a place that has different people of different backgrounds I would think we would not think so highly of the American culture only.      No culture is better than another, it is all subjective from different points of view. If you haven't lived it since birth, then how do you know how it's like if all you've ever known was one culture?      America has to be one of the most dis-respectable countries there is, and to impede on other countries affairs when it is committing the same heinous acts is moronic.      You will probably say how can I say that about the place I live in, well, not everything is peaches and I am not some blind conformist who will take in the good and dispose of the bad.      Yes, even your own country cannot be perfect.
20090128232125AAd6nSt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the Bible all about RIGHT and WRONG or BLACK and WHITE?	Is God about right and wrong only?      The Bible HAS MANY "grey" areas for humans to dwell in.God allowed Abraham to lie. God allowed a prostitute (without quitting her job) to spy for Him and to serve Him.      Jesus did not stone a prostitute although the Law says she MUST be stoned.      God allowed killings to happen in wars, even to kill women and children, for whatever reason there is.      Women are told not to be preachers in church in the Bible yet there ARE MANY female prophets, apostles in the Bible.      How can Christianity or God be simply black and white, or right and wrong?

Yeah I was sitting next to this girl, and she was playing footsie with me.  At first I thought she was just messing and playing around with me, so I was playing footsie with her back.  I than stopped, but she didn't, she continued to play with me.  I was a little freaked out, and didn't know what to do or say.  So I just simply got up and left the area.        What does this mean though?  Is she gay and is she attracted to me?  Why would a girl play footsie with another girl?  She's not my friend or anything, I only know her through a few classes that we have with each other.

I'm bi but I used to think I was gay and have been open about it the whole time and I think their hilarious. I have a personal belief that the best way to overcome prejudice is to poke fun at it and some of these jokes really are funny.          What do you call 50 lesbians and 50 government employees in one room?   100 people that don''t do d*ck!            What do you call a gay bar with no bar stools?   A fruit stand.         You see what I'm talking about, absolutely priceless and they don't offend me in the slightest. I think the funny thing about stereotypes is that often they really are true. I'm sorry but everybody knows a screaming Mary who cares more about his nails than his next meal. There is nothing wrong about embracing the things that make us unique and poking fun at each other from time to time.       Oh, and if you have any more one-liners that are in good taste please let me know.

20090128231848AAwsqVB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think...is a good way to approach this issue?	Not that I plan to make life changing decisions based on Y!A...but I do want your input! =)   Right now I am facing some really tough decisions...   My passion is international affairs...particularly in regards to the Middle East and Persian Gulf. However at this time I haven't even found an entry job that I could consider as a starting point. I would prefer to go to graduate school and learn a foreign language...but it is too much of a risk to take out loans and do an internship without the guarantee of a job. The economy is sooo bad...and I already know it will get much worse before its get better. I simply dont have the credentials to compete with people with 3 foreign languages, internships, and years or work experience.      I am considering the military due to the fact that I would be able to (hopefully) gain valuable work experience in international affairs.....and gain valuable insight into the inner workings of foreign relations. Of course...from the outside nothing is like what it seems. You are really there to serve them and not yourself. They may place you were they want you to be and not where your strength's lie.      The main problem is my family though. My parents would be devasted that they worked so hard to put me through college...only to lose me due to a war. Lets be realistic..even if we pull out of Iraq...we will still be in Afghanistan and God knows where else. The type of stress that would put on my parents I cannot imagine. Plus, I am their only child. I dont think I will ever meet the right person and get married..so definitely no children. I worry about who will take care of them if I am gone...      Sorry for the long post....what do you think?

20090129021822AAo2gh5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, why do you claim that you "know" God exists and claim that you have "faith" in the same breath?	Christians will often claim that they have faith.  Having faith in something means that you believe in something despite any factual evidence.  And then you also claim that you "know" God exists.  If you "know" something, it means you have factual evidence.  And if you have factual evidence, you don't have faith.      So you gotta make up your minds here.  It is either one of these:      1.  You have faith that God exists, meaning that you believe in your God while ignoring every other God out of pure ignorance.      or       2.  You "know" God exists, which inturn would make you liar.  And liars don't inherit heaven---according to your bible  XD

"No one is perfect, and we all sin, but we believe in Jesus, therefore we will be saved anyway."      But ironically though, they don't seem to think that homosexuals have the right to sin like they do.  They have some kind of special priviledge I guess.

Its all American. Don't get me wrong I am in touch, and proud of my African roots and heritage, but I have a much deeper connection with my American roots seeing how this is my country. And I have pride in that too. What do you think?

A guy in my school I like, but I do not know if I am imagining things or whatnot since I like him. I once tried to add him on Facebook once, but he declined me on Facebook, but he keeps showing positive signs in person like flirting. We returned from break back to school, and I saw him. I decided to look on his Facebook's status, and it read, "...is glad to see Tim (My name,and "maybe" who he was referring to) back at school." He does know my name. What do you think?
20090128232003AAguZaB	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	I need help with a serious issue, dealing with family matters Islamiclly?	Please not this is extremely serious and not for young children.       About 3 years ago I was on the computer and in the next room over my mom was laying on the couch. And (this hurts me to even type this) I herd my mother having phone sex. I am not going to use the term "overheard" because she didn't even care if I heard or not. I assumed I was going crazy literally, I wanted to seek help for myself. I thought it couldn't of been possible.      Well about 2 weeks later I heard in again, some situation. I'm on the computer and her well, yeah. It happens again.       So its been almost 3 years and I haven't told a soul, not even my own. And it's is obvious my mother is doing something with someone my family is all familiar with. And like any teen I was complaining and my dad asks me an hour ago, what is really bothering you? Why are you complaining about your mother so much? Mind you for the past 2 years she has barely spent longer then 3 days in the home, only when her car broke down and she still had friends pick her up. She stays out till all hours of the night and spends hundreds of dollars in casinos almost bi-weekly. And money is very tight in out current situation. We are basically poor. And I am afraid to ask my mom what is she going to cook because every time I do she practically attacks me. She hasn't cooks two days in a row for 2 years now.      Well so I told him, I said I herd her masturbating while on the phone. And he, being the best husband alive didn't believe me. He said, Islamically I'm going to need more proof. But I AM ENOUGH PROOF. I feel like its my fault now. He would literally cut off his digits with a spoon if she told him too. And now I think I just ruined my families life.       She is of course not here tonight and didn't answer his phone calls like always.    What can you guys tell me? Please help!   And yes we are supposed to be Muslim.

So my parents found out I'm bisexual, I got a lot of help (from fellow people on yahoo answers) and figured that instead of having to cover my tracks all the time I've just got to be open about it and accept that my parents know. Normally, I would deny to everyone and I tried for years to keep it quiet. I've accepted a long time ago that I was bisexual, but I guess I always just felt like my parents would be upset with me if they knew. Now that they do, the are perfectly accepting and I am very grateful for that. But where do I go from here? Should I talk to them or have them come to me with questions? I am not a big talker, and I really don't really want to have to talk about it with them, but I know that it is coming and I will have to have a big sit down talk with them, but is there any tips out there for making it easier? How can I open up a little more? What shouldn't I say?

20090128234744AAYEePY	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Teenagers get no respect? Age restrictions dumb.?	Ok, there are a few things i would like to say before we begin, first of all is that i am usually very laid back and calm, second is that i dont like it when people act like nothing is wrong when they do somthing they have been brainwashed is the "only way" ie a history teacher that dosent think about the other sides of the stories.      Now, knowing that is out of my system, i have a daily life segment for you to observe.      I today went to the mall, yes the mall- and the sole purpose of the trip was to buy fallout 3 from an EBGames store, because i have a gift card a friend got me this christmas- ok a while after but thats beside the point.      Anyways, i go in look around, search but it isnt there- so i stand in lineup behind several other gamer people, till i finally am summoned by a twenty-somthing woman behind the counter, hot yes but i was dedicated to getting my game! Focus.      Anyways she gave me that blank stare that all employees of gamestop and EB have to perfect before enrollment, the "i don't give a damn now hand over the bills and let us rob you" look.      Now, i ask her if they have fallout 3, for xbox (360)- yes we do, press pound to continue replies the sensless robot.      Okayyy? i reply, getting the blank stare again, i have a giftcard for EBgames, can i use it here? puzzled looks appearing on face now....      Okay, replies the now self aware dolt, i just need to see i.d confirming you are 17 years of age.      WHAT!!!!>!>!>?!?!?!? i almost blurt out, WTF is wrong with you? ITS A freaking game you stupid *&%*^!!!!!!!      Anyway, i just kinda put my wallet back in my pocket, frowned and walked out of the now forbidden untill im 17 zone.      Point being, im 16 and 1/2, i got my learners first try, my little brother under 13 bought games like this by himself, WHAT GIVES?!?!?!?      I know its to protect their asses but my thought process as i left the store went as follows:   1. create diversion and take game? No, too many innocents   2. Remove counter lady from equation, ohh look a house of knives, look at that replica battle axe, only 499.99!   3.  ask stranger to buy game for me, forget it- by now im gonna need more than a game to cheer me up.      See my point yet? Apparently people in U.S can enlist in military, die for their country, but not drink beer yet.      In canada however, well seeing as we only have a "peacekeeping force"   i figure gaming is next in line, but apparently i cant do that either.      The whole thing that i hated most was that the damn girl wasnt a guy, meaning that if i had come there before womens rights enacted, she would be beaten if she didn't give me the game, but no- she is fully entitled to "refuse sale of M rated games to any persons under 17 (or 18 depending on revenue of the day)      Also note that most guy employees would also give me that game, as i have been there on several occasions and delbt with guy employees who were "cool" for all intents, plus this method dosent reverse the time space continuum thing....      Okay, enough rambling you say. Fair enough- just i want to know why i cant buy a video game because its too violent, yet things on the news seem far more violent and evil to me.

He writes in a unknown language.Our family has only known about this a short time and we are trying our best to help him. we gave him books to read that might help him. He believes he is "obsessed."

I have read some books faster than I ever thought I could read to try to help him. What do I do when he's not actually possessed just obsessed????

20090129002629AATCdaD	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	My American History Teachers Rant ?	My American History Teacher in college is African American and he thinks Barack Obama is the overrated. I will paraphrase his 15 min speech. He said that to say we made history when he was elected is undeniable. But to say that it was impossible is ignorant. He said that for us as Americans to be so amazed and proud of ourselves that we elected a Black Man as president is dumb. To be an American citizen and to not feel or expect that any person of any race of any gender of any creed can succeed in life isnt truly filled with the American spirit. And I remind you he is a college history teacher. He said that to those who cried or those who felt validated or for those who were "proud" again to be Americans were never true Americans, they were people living in America. He also said although he is African American and he did vote for Obama, he did not cry or even cared too much. He compared those who cried when Obama was elected to that of a person crying when they turn on a faucet and water comes out or crying when a light turns on after you flip a switch. Why are you so surprised ?  That is how it is like with Obama being elected. Nothing special. I quote "Just like any other Presidential Inauguration."      Now being a Obama supporter and I admit I did get a little teary eyed when he won.  But I totally understand where he is coming from. Do you agree or disagree with his sentiments ?

20090129013037AA7YGfA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would you consider me a Christian? (Read on...)?	I was born into a Christian family (Actually Catholic, but it is still under the Christian faith) and attended a Christian elementary and junior high. I am just prefacing my question with this to make clear that I have indeed studied the bible, gone to chapel, and accepted Jesus into my heart. Now, I think that I may not be a Christian because I don't believe that Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation. I have always felt that this aspect of Christianity was cruel. The Bible clearly states that Jesus is the way, the truth, the light, and no one shall get to the father except through him and all who do not believe shall perish. I believe that Jesus existed, was a great man, died on the Christ, may have been the son of God, but is more the saviour for christians. To say that all non-Christians shall perish is so cruel because there are good people of all faiths (and even those who are non-religous). I refuse to believe this. If I am considered a Christian then I just have to say this: Jesus may be my way, but I truly believe that there are other ways in other faiths. I would like to think that Jesus would love people of all faiths, especially because many of them preach his same ideals.       Please no Zealots need to respond.

I have this friend who claims to be 100% lesbian and says she's not attracted to men at all. When her and I hang out together, she gets really huggy and cuddly with me. She's really touchy feely, she'll hold my hand and if we sit down to watch TV or a movie, she has no problem snuggling right up next to me. When I flirt with her, she gets all giggly and sweet. She blows me kisses, rubs my head, massages my shoulders, all that stuff. Anyway, so if all of the above isn't enough, it was by birthday yesterday and her and I and a bunch of other friends went out to party. She gave me my present and I said, hey so where's my birthday kiss. I expected a hey I'm gay, but not, she grabbed my face and laid one on me, right on my lips and lingered... no tongue. Another friend happened to take a pic of us at that exact moment. Well she got a hold of that pic, put it on her myspace as her default and in the caption, she said, 'If only I were straight.' So seriously, what does all that mean, is she really gay?
20090129023412AAuI0Ag	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do I ignore her because of her sexual advances, or do I tell her how I feel?	I've had a past with this girl, we met at a party and had physical intimacies...later she fell for a boy but played around with me. Stayed over at my house, cuddled and even kissed me. Ultimately she pursued the boy. I ignored her for a month and decided I wouldn't play the doormat. Later she started to call me, and finally I saw her last night at a masquerade benefit ball. I had some to drink and she came up to me and asked me to dance. We were grinding and she pulled me against her body and at some point she was kissing my neck. I reciprocated, and then she said she had something to tell me. She avoided telling me, and said she should tell me when she's sober. The dancing was intense. We sat down and she said that she was really attracted to me, that I was sexy and if she wasn't pursuing "this boy," she would definitely be chasing me. OH BURN! She was extremely intoxicated at this point, as was I and I brushed it off. She continued to kiss on me and grab me. She drank too much that night and I assisted her in the bathroom and she would grab my ankles or rub my arm up and down, I know she was drunk but how many times does it take for these behaviors not to be pawned off as drunkeness? There are 5+ different occasions that she has "gotten all up in my goodies!" She cuddled with me that night and put my arms around her, despite "this boy," laying right next to us. She payed him much less attention. I'm confused and I, despite her and my definite sexual attraction, I know I should drop her or try to be her friend. How exactly do two girls who are intensely attracted to each other stay friends? Or do they? Why does she hold me the way she does if she likes Him?

20090406153908AApjhAG	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Which carries more importance: a wedding or a funeral?	I think a funeral carries far more importance than a wedding because it  breaks things down on an individual level so you are celebrating what that person meant to you throughout his life and your experience with that person from the time you met him or her. A wedding is a bond between two people living in the same house, a bond of teamwork and interdependence which also carries importance, but personally I think a funeral is more important. Obviously a wedding is more enthusiastic to attend than the death of a loved one, but I think in the overall scheme of things death brings people closer together than any wedding because you are all united in the memory of that person whereas with a wedding some might personally know one or both mates and some might not but that relationship is vague as likely no one in attendence will know anything personal about how the marriage is going but at a funeral most attendees have their own personal intimate memories of the individual who has died because they had prior contact with the person. Without that prior contact it is like hearing a news report of someone who died but you have never seen or met so you aren't likely moved to tears because there was no personal attachment to the individual. Anyway I think a wedding although happier, carries less importance than a funeral, although I know both are important in their own ways. Some may disagree. That is fine. I just thought this would make interesting discussion. I been to funerals of people I barely knew or knew only one of the individuals and it was fun, but the funeral carries more emotional attachment as you celebrate what the person meant to you and I had a cousin-in-law, great-grandfather, and uncle die in the past 2 years between 2007-08.

20090128205904AAIDQ71	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist : What do you think about this :)?	This story is most likely an urban legend, but it is still encouraging.    There was a professor of philosophy there who was a deeply committed atheist. His primary goal for one required class was to spend the entire semester attempting to prove that God couldn't exist. His students were always afraid to argue with him because of his impeccable logic. For twenty years he had taught this class and NO ONE had ever had the courage to go against him. Sure, some had argued in class at times, but no one had ever *really gone against him* (you'll see what I mean later). Nobody would go against him because he had a reputation.      At the end of every semester, on the last day, he would say to the class of 300 students, "If there is anyone here who still believes in God, stand up!" In twenty years, nobody ever stood up. They knew what he was going to do next. He would say, "Because anyone who believes in God is a fool. If God existed, he could stop this piece of chalk from hitting the ground and breaking. Such a simple task to prove he is God, and yet he can't do it." And every year he would drop the chalk onto the tile floor of the classroom and it could shatter into a hundred pieces. All of the students could do nothing but stop and stare. Most of the students were convinced that God couldn't exist. Certainly, a number of Christians had slipped through, but for 20 years they had been too afraid to stand up.      Well, a few years ago there was a freshman who happened to enroll in the class. He was a Christian, and had heard the stories about this professor. He had to take the class because it was one of the required classes for his major. And he was afraid. But for three months that semester, he prayed every morning that he would have the courage to stand up no matter what the professor said or what the class thought. Nothing they said or did could ever shatter his faith, he hoped. Finally, the day came. The professor said, "If there is anyone here who still believes in God, stand up!" The professor, and the class of 300 people looked at him, shocked, as he stood up at the back of the room. The professor shouted, "YOU FOOL! If nothing I have said all semester has convinced you that God doesn't exist, then you are a fool! If God existed, he could keep this piece of chalk from breaking when it hit the ground!" He proceeded to drop the chalk, but as he did, it slipped out of his fingers, off his shirt cuff, onto the pleats of his pants, down his leg, and off his shoe. And as it hit the ground, it simply rolled away, UNBROKEN. The professor's jaw dropped as he stared at the chalk. He looked up at the young man and then ran out of the lecture hall. The young man who had stood up proceeded to walk to the front of the room and share his faith in Jesus for the next half hour. 300 students stayed and listened as he told of God's love for them and of his power through Jesus.          -- http://www.inspirationalarchive.com/text...

20090128210824AAg6nwO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists and other nonbelievers: does this move you like it did me? What do you feel when you read this?	Long ago, or maybe not so long ago, there was a tribe in a dark, cold cavern. The cave dwellers would huddle together and cry against the chill. Loud and long they wailed. It was all they did. It was all they knew to do. The sounds in the cave were mournful, but the people didn't know it, for they had never known joy. The spirit in the cave was death, but the people didn't know it, for they had never known life.       But then, one day, they heard a different voice. "I have heard your cries," it announced. "I have felt your chill and seen your darkness. I have come to help."       The cave people grew quiet. They had never heard this voice. hope sounded strange to their ears. "How can we know you have come to help?"       "Trust me," he answered. "I have what you need."       The cave people peered through the darkness at the figure of the stranger. He was stacking something, then stooping and stacking more.       "What are you doing?" one cried, nervous.       The stranger didn't answer.       "What are you making?" one shouted even louder.       Still no response.       "Tell us!" demanded a third.       The visitor stood and spoke in the direction of the voices. "I have what you need." With that he turned to the pile at his feet and lit it. Wood ignited, flames erupted, and light filled the cavern.       The cave people turned away in fear. "Put it out!" they cried. "It hurts to see it."       "Light always hurts before it helps," he answered. "Step closer. The pain will soon pass."       "Not I," declared a voice.       "Nor I," agreed a second.       "Only a fool would risk exposing his eyes to such light."       The stranger stood next to the fire. "Would you prefer the darkness? Would you prefer the cold? Don't consult your fears. Take a step of faith"       For a long time no one spoke. The people hovered in groups covering their eyes. The fire builder stood next to the fire. "It's warm here," he invited.       "He's right," one from behind him announced. "It's warmer." The stranger turned a saw a figure slowly stepping toward the fire. "I can open my eyes now," she proclaimed. "I can see."       "Come closer," invited the fire builder.       She did. She stepped into the ring of light.       "It's so warm!" she extended her hands and sighed as her chill began to pass.       "Come, everyone! Feel the warmth," she invited.       "Silence, woman!" cried one of the cave dwellers. "Dare you lead us into your folly? Leave us. Leave us and take your light with you."       She turned to the stranger. "Why won't they come?"       "They choose the chill, for though it's cold, it's what they know. They'd rather be cold than change."       "And live in the dark?"       "And live in the dark."       The now-warm woman stood silent. Looking first at the dark, then at the man.       "Will you leave the fire?" he asked.       She paused, then answered, "I cannot. I cannot bear the cold." Then she spoke again. "But nor can I bear the thought of my people in darkness."       "You don't have to," he responded, reaching into the fire and removing a stick. "Carry this to your people. Tell them the light is here, and the light is warm. Tell them the light is for all who desire it."       And so she took the small flame and stepped into the shadows.   ---  http://www.inspirationalarchive.com/text...

Being born sterile? Great, god wants you to adopt kids instead. What about Anorexia? It's considered a mental disease, so god MUST have given it to me? But what of how it makes me sin, is that my fault, or gods? Who's to blame for anorexia? God, who gave it to me; or myself, the actual sinner?

20090128210328AAmSqMv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Christians?	If these claims are true, wouldn't it be worth finding out for yourself for sure by asking God himself?      -There are additional writings from God's true prophets available to us.   -Jesus Christ visited another group of people and we can read his words.   -There is a Prophet of God, like Moses, on the earth today.   -There is one church on the earth today that was founded by and led by Christ himself.      Wouldn't those things be the most exciting pieces of news to true Christians since the Bible was canonized and translated???      Wouldn't any true and believing Christian hope that these claims were true, but find out for themselves?      There is one such church that makes these claims.  Isn't it the best news in hundreds of years for Christians if it is true???

Peter said, you are the Messiah, the son of the living God."   Jesus said unto him, "Blessed are you Peter, for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my father in heaven did."      who do you say Jesus is?      This same Peter, before Jesus death as predicted by Jesus, denied Jesus three times, stating "I do not know him" and went and wept bitterly.      Yet, later repented and forgiven,  filled with salvation in the Spirit of God,   "And preaching Peter led over 3,000 of the Jewish people to the Messiah."         To me once JESUS WAS A CUSS WORD   my Jewish mom had taught me, "David Jesus is a liar and a deciever, have nothing to do with him."      Yet later going into sin, from the hoplessness of  the religion that had rewritten itself rejecting Moses command for a blood sacrifice for sins Leviticus 17:11   I did not want a God that abandoned us 2000 years ago and left us with no prophets just the words "He will be exalted but first marred more than any man, and will lay down his life as a lamb to make atonement for our sins." "He will die with the wicked and be burried with the rich.  He will see his seed and prosper."   Isaiah 52:13-53:12      so I prayed as he asks   "Help me Jesus, I am sorry for my sins, come into my heart and be my best friend, amen."    Revelation 1:1 chapter 1 verse 1  speaking from heaven & 3:19&20 "I love you, and ask you to repent of your sins.  Behold i am at your heart's door knocking to come in, if you ask me in I will come in and fellowship with you and you with me."      WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF JESUS?  mine was a cuss word, now he is my Messiah, savior and best friend.
20090129021455AATR52g	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are you a person who has the Joy of the Lord, and willing to to speak up for the truth?	"The joy of the Lord is our strength." the Bible      the Messiah said if you suffer with me you will reign with me.   If they hated me they will hate you, but be of good courage, for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you, jump for joy for great is your reward in heaven.  Luke in the gospels      The Prophet Before    The Storm - Part I   An Interview With a Jew that came to the Messiah Nathanael And    A Profile In  Courage    With An After-Word Conclusion   By Michael James           "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city .... [And to the  Jews who rejected his messiahship, said Jesus] You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."              Each generation gives rise to men and women of unique courage and insight. More often than not, they are pilloried, ridiculed and sidelined as eccentrics or worse. Some of them suffer terribly at the hands of those they seek to help, and almost all of them die in poverty and obscurity, only to be remembered with veneration by future generations as prophets whose warnings and remonstrations fell on deaf ears.         We live in a world crowded by occultist soothsayers, New Age gurus, esoteric magicians, deceitful politicians, putative Antichrists and establishment "holy men" claiming to have the ear of God. While Madonna flirts with Kabbalism rejection of the Messiah for its spirit guides, as people scour Talmud for hidden revelations like that Jesus was an illigitimate son, movie stars sell their souls to Scientology, as millions of Europeans sink into the abyss of God-hating humanism, one can be forgiven for thinking we are living at the End of the Age.         He is the Watchman on the tower who warns of dangers to come, and yet the revellers in the courtyard mock him, for their ears are closed to the truth. He wanders the streets and takes each to task, yet in turn he is rewarded with abuse, physical assault, wicked and vicious insults, and false charges brought against him by those who rule from the latter day in unbelief. . Penniless and despised by unbelievers, he arises each day with an empty belly but filled with the strength of God to sustain him; and once again he takes his message to those who are wealthy in hubris but poor at heart: Jews who remain trapped in the belief against the Messiah?        That man is Brother Nathanael.         Mike: How did your family and friends react when you renounced the beliefs against the messiah and embraced the Messiah?        Br. Nathanael: My mother had a fit. First of all our rabbi told my mother I certainly must now have deep psychological problems, not "religious" problems, and should be addressed as such. After a few failed counselling sessions that my mother dragged me to, she finally realized that this was a "religious" problem.         So my mother and father took me to see some rabbis and my dad kept saying, "Our son knows the Bible better than the rabbis!" Finally, my mother gave up the battle but not without continually nagging me and trying to make me feel guilty for "abandoning our people". I kept on telling my mother through the year about Jesus being the Jewish Messiah, and one year before she died, 33 years later after I became a Christian, she came to faith in the Messiah.             Mike: Many people are aware that Jews against the Messiah in America are working assiduously to destroy the efforts of those that believe in the Messiah, but few are resisting the onslaught. How is your message treated in the streets?         Br. Nathanael: I went to the headquarters of the ACLU in Wall Street three times last summer. I had a huge sign that I was holding which read, "ACLU JEWS ARE ANTI-CHRIST!" The people of Wall Street were in an absolute state of shock.         The ACLU, (which by the way advocates for "free speech"), called the police on my eighth appearance. The eighth police division must have been paid off -- for they physically escorted me eight blocks away. But I came right back when I saw them going into a coffee shop.         Each time I was there in Wall Street, I was physically assaulted by Jews. And each time the police, (who are all over the place in Wall Street because of 9-11), took the side of the Jews. One Jewish man, very well dressed in a London Fog overcoat, threw a large cup of hot coffee all over me and my pristine white robe. The police came at me with their machine guns (all over the place in Wall Street), and while pinning me against the wall and screaming at me, the Jewish man who threw the coffee on me just stood there with a big smile on his face.         Mike: Christianity is perhaps the last bulwark between freedom

20090128210443AAvPlUQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where is the conflict between science & religion coming from? Has it sprung from fatal errors as einsten said?	To me they are dealing with different aspects of reality. Science deals with the logical, concrete, and objective and religion deals with the abstract, intuitive, and experiential. They should balance each other, not contradict.       I do not consider religions such as Christianity to be a thing you either literally believe in or you don’t.  I think that is missing the point of the role in which religious symbology plays in human psychology. They are archetypal myths, I mean myth in the highest sense of the word, in the way that Joseph Campbell or Carl Jung would use it. Myth as a structure in principle of our experience, a story that we tell to make sense of that aspect of reality that science cannot touch, because it’s too primordial   It says in the bible that the gates of the kingdom of heaven are pearls, implying that they are small as the hole in a pearl. You cannot get through them if you think that heaven is a place. Heaven is a state of mind, a state of consciousness.  Once we recognize that this role that Christ plays in the Christian story of ‘saving us’, is not to return us to paradise, it is to reveal that paradise was already present and that the fall was produced by our own fear and ignorance.  The fall symbolizes the human consciousness break from nature. Humans are at the point where they have full self awareness and awareness of their actions on the world around them. So, with that comes some responsibility. Mankind is still eating the forbidden fruit. We keep tearing up the planet to gain material wealth and building weapons out of fear. Our ignorance and sin is creating the majority of suffering. We have all the resources to create a perfect world. If we didn't choose to live out of fear and greed       What is it about science that is so contradicting to spirituality and vice versa? Why do so many christians reject evoulution and such and why do so many atheists reject sprituality?    God does not mean some magic man in the sky watching over, god is about realizing consciousness as an interconnected part of nature, coming to know your thoughts are never isloalated to your self, they are always existing in context of this greater whole, we call universe.

""Papa Don't Preach" is sung from the perspective of a teenage girl who admits to her father [...] that not only is she pregnant, but she plans to keep and raise the child. Typically for Madonna, the single caused some controversy because of its somewhat taboo subject matter. It was criticized by parents, religious groups, and women's organizations because it seemed to glorify teenage pregnancy."      Source:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Don%27...       What is your opinion on the subject matter?

20090129031746AAKpScW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people think "Christianity" is like all other religions?	Look at what separates them.      In all major religions,       islam,   jehovah's witnesses,   hinduism,   buddhism,   mormonism,   racism <-- (haha.. just jokin')   etc.      the followers strive to rid themselves of "sin" through various practices.    They may...   "pray in a prescribed way",   "do various good works",    "deny themselves legitimate sexual pleasure",   "follow dietary restrictions",    "lie on beds of nails" & other such things.      All so that they can elevate to a higher level of nirvana, reincarnation, etc.      The uniqueness of "Christianity" in Jesus Christ is shown in His statement, "The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins". There is no - other religion that allows a person to be completely free of paying for his/her own sin.        No other religious leader has ever made this claim. Jesus Christ alone can wash away every sin anyone has ever committed, be-cause of what He did on the cross. By paying the penalty for our sin, He can release us from the torture of guilt. We cannot do anything in the way of religious works to wash away our sins. Forgiveness is a free gift of God (Ephesians 2:8,9).      Christianity is completely different from every other religion. It stands alone at being unique from the rest.

20090129002558AALKGi3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have you ever thought perhaps heaven and hell are the same place, and only your attitude is different?	Since I take the whole thing as myth, I can afford to speculate.  But I'm not alone in this.  I believe it was Alex Comfort in "Tetrarch" who proposed the idea the first time I came across it.      Maybe heaven can be described as the place where Christians want to be and hell the same place when people who don't want to be there are forced into it.  As pointed out in another question just a minute ago, the idea of singing God's praises forever, no escape, does not have a lot of appeal for most of us.  It sounds hellishly boring.

20090128232706AAD6XQ8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Bible contradictions~~~if it's perfect, ?	Okay first off, I just want to say, I'm not taking a personal attack, I just need information, because I'm exploring all religions and getting my own view on them, and deciding myself which religion I'll follow. So here's my question. A lot of Christians' believe that the Bible is perfect, yet I myself just reading it can find a lot of contradictions, so if it's God's word, shouldn't it be perfect. And for those atheist that are going to say it's not God's word because he doesn't exist, I already have read LOTS of evidence to show he does exist. But Interestingly on my last question I asked if the Bible has been changed and some people seemed to agree whereas others disagreed, but if it has changed, and personally I think it has, how am I meant to follow a religion that's been changed over and over again. And i'll post up the contradictions I found by myself, when I have time.       peace be with you all      And please no inappropriate comments!

American accent is more comfortable for me, but I figured it would be cooler if I had an accent, so when I started college I just used the accent I grew up with.      Though, would you find it weird of someone if they could speak with both English/Aussie accent AND American?      I think some people find it strange when I fade in and out of American/NonAmerican accents.      I explain to them I grew up with the accent but I've been in America for about 9 years now so I've picked it up, I just like my natural accent better.      I get the feeling some people think it strange, and I know some people (like celebrities) just go off randomly and fake accents they never had/ never learned, and I don't want to feel like people think I'm some weirdo that just fakes having an accent.

20090128232744AAoXBbb	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is this guy bisexual, or actually straight?	I've been debating this with a few people about this guy's sexuality, I think he's around 25. He says he feels he's straight, but here's why I question it.      I says he's 100% into girls, but he can't get a date. He always says how girls he finds attractive just seem to not want him. He's not picky,  he actually has a wide range he likes. He just wants someone who at least is cute in her own way, and a good personality. He says it's extremely rare for a girl to like him, and when the few does, they're absolutely not his type.       He says it's not fair how other people can find what they desire, someone to be with, hold, touch, kiss, have companioship, all those things some take for granted, but he can't obtain it. He says that makes him feel incredibly lonely and desperate because he's all about that stuff and missing it.      Here's the thing. I've been noticing he's been hanging out with this emo looking dude a lot. This emo guy, as strange as it is, looks so feminine, and acts dainty, like he could be a girl, and a somewhat cute one as weird as that sounds. And I could have sworn I saw them kiss at this club the other day. So I said, dude your clearly not straight. He said he knows it seems like he's into guys, but he feels this emo guy was the closest thing to the kind of girl he was looking for, and that he would rather just be with an awesome girl, but since they don't seem interested, but this girly guy does, he settles for him, which to me is a weird replacement of what he claims to want. Is he Pansexual or something?      Your thoughts.

He's not my boyfriend or anything, we're not even technically dating, but I still think he might want to spend v-day together.      I read in Cosmo magazine, and friends have told me, that a girl should sort of play hard to get, but not too hard to get. This year I have no plans for v-day, but should I tell him that I do so I don't seem available to him 24/7? I just think that if I spend v-day with him, hardly knowing him, it seems like I'm a loser and I had no plans on v-day and that I'm not playing hard to get *at all* and that's not good.

I dated a girl for the first time and the relationship was over after 2 months. She was just too hard to be with, she actually got mad at me a couple of weeks ago for going to talk to my cousin at her bar. I told her that she could come with me, but she said that since we'd been hanging out so much she hadn't really studied so she should do that. I was totally fine with that and i went by myself. So later on that night, she sent me a text asking me where I was and I told her I was still at the bar with my cousin. She ignored that part, and asked me to come to her house anyway, and I told her that I could come later once we were done talking. My cousin's been with girls before, and I needed to vent so that's why I was there, and that's what I told her. But, once again the drama started...She went off on me and told me that I'm always somewhere else when I can be with her, so I responded that she was the one who didn't want to come and basically we argued through text for 30 minutes! There's more to it than that but it's way too long to put here. Really, I just want to know if it's like this with most girls, all the drama and the arguing...Or did I just pick the wrong one?

20090129032204AATOcIU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you take the bible literally?	If so, Have you ever truly done the math with Noah's Ark?   ChristianAnswers.net explains that as many as 50,000 animals (including creatures that may now be extinct) could have fit on board the ark.  Assuming that 50,000 animals can fit on the ark...was there room for food?       An elephant, giraffe, and a hippo combined will eat around 640lbs of greenery a day. You times that by 150 days.(Gen. 8:3-5) You will get a total of 96,000 pounds of greenery. Now times that by 2 (Gen.2) you will get 192,000 pounds. That is a lot of food to feed 6 animals.       Then you will have another problem...the carnivores. Do they eat stored meat (which can spoil in days) or extra animals? (Either way that is a lot of food) Then, what did the carnivores eat after the flood? The decomposing bodies, or the last remaining species from the Ark? If you say decomposing bodies then you have the problem with salmonella which would have killed any animal that would have eaten it.  So the animals would have a choice starve to death, eat the last remaining species, or get salmonella and die.  There shouldnt be any animals left after the flood due to starvation since the carnivors would have eaten the last remaining species.       Last problem...Did Noah travel across the world to find the animals?    Lewis and Clark took 3 years. It would take Noah a lot longer just to find and capture the animals and that is just in America alone. How did the animals get back to their habitat after the flood? If you say they gathered themselves then I say to you that there is not one animal on this planet that can swim 50 miles without drowning.    Do the math and question. Otherwise your blind faith will lead you right into a wall.
20090129030014AA2kFwq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do some Christians beleive the earth/humanity is 6000 years old?	Sincerely even remains of Jericho a biblical site prove that it existed as far back as 7,000 BC. Many Neolithic settlements like Jarmo and Catal Huyuk are also dated to 6,000BC at the very least.      Recently the theory of Anthropologists that North Americans came into the continent from Siberia about 13,000 years ago is put into question as some sites in Mexico show human sttlement as far back as 25,000 years, about 15,000 years earlier than expected. What is more scientists now beleive the Americas were as cosmopolitan then as they are now because people sailed to them along the sea ice that covered much of North Atlantic from Europe and others from Japan and the Far East.The movement from Siberia being only one of many complex migratory routes taken.      Australia was occupied about 50,000 years ago by African tribes moving across the Sinai,through the Indian subcontinent,Indochina and across current pacific islands like Phillipines and Indonesia which with lower sea levels then could be more easily crossed.      So what is with the 6,000 year magic figure? At the very least christians should accept that the human race is much older than we beleive it is.The bible even if taken literraly vindicates itself though other books.For example Numbers 14:33-34 and Ezekiel 4:5 say a day can correspond to a whole year if God sees fit.So why read Genesis years as 365 day years??      If Christians accept that a day to God is like 1000years, then it is equally likely that 365 days X 930(Adam years) is 339,450 years. At least this is scientifically sound.      Why are some christians so narrow minded?

As for STDs well they do full on now anyways so we can just stop the preggies)      2) Promote gay sex. (If somehow we brain wash the lads and ladies. Its Greek style or wait until you are 16 it maybe could work. If it didn't then still no pregnancies)      3) Installing the coil in teenies who are active. (this has been done in China after the first baby it is a medical option to have it. Its cost effective, doesn't have the same side effects as the pill and the guys can enjoy giving her the full load)      4) Curfew kids. This whole chav lifestyle of staying out late, boozing and getting into fights could be solved. If it is illegal for anyone under 18 to be out later than 6pm. We can't rely on adults because some are from problem families.       Any suggestions which would you chose? Modify? Mix n match?

20090128210240AA9sYG9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian humor? Or a thought for others?	A college student attended a philosophy class which held a discussion about God's existence. The professor presented the following logic: “Has anyone in this class ever heard God?” No one spoke. “Has anyone in this class ever touched God?” Again, no one spoke. “Has anyone in this class ever seen God?” When no one spoke for the third time, he said, “Then there is no God.”      One student thought for a second and then asked for permission to reply. Curious to hear this bold student's response, the professor agreed. The student stood up and asked the following: “Has anyone in this class ever heard our professor's brain?” Silence. “Has anyone in this class ever touched our professor's brain?” Absolute silence. “Has anyone in this class ever seen our professor's brain?” When no one in the class dared to speak, the student concluded, “Then, according to our professor's logic, it must be true that our professor has no brain!”

Because of this, they no more knew what was above the clouds than below the top layer of soil.  So heaven being above clouds and hell being below the surface made sense.    But do you understand that now that we know that the earth is round and inside the earth is a molten core and above the earth is our atmosphere, it makes no sense to continue to believe in hell and heaven???

I just wonder how many of you christians out there really stick to what your bible says.  Since you christians believe sex should only be committed for the sake of procreation ( no spilled seed is allowed), you should only be having sex when you want children ( in marriage of course).        Oh, and one thing more.  For those of you christians who's never been laid before marriage, is it because you're devoted to your bible, or is it because you've been rejected!

They are fine with my interest in the Mormon religion and accept the fact that missionaries will soon be coming to my door.    The thing is that I'm embarrassed to let ANYONE into my house due to the fact that my parents chain-smoke inside; doors closed and everything.   I know that Morons are against tobacco so I don't want to let them inside and smell the smoke, but I also don't want to come inside as rude. It also is a little cold here too.    What can I do?

I'm sure some of them think I'm the anti crist right now. I don't think I am lol. And they don't want anyone group to take over the world cause then the anti crist could use it. That's insane. and they think sex is a sin. They were talking about how evil in the world increasing is a sign of the anti crist and they mentioned gay people getting married. That's horrible. there the evil ones. Gay people are just living there lives and these maniacs think that they are evil signs of the anti crist. Can't these people see that it's insane and scary. You can't just say accept people and there beliefs. These people oppress women, gays, other religions and call people evil for doing things that feel good. and they almost took over the country!!!

I over heard attendees saying they will refrain from doing business with him. Talk about a bad impression. I came in late so I did not eat, but I was invited to lunch by a scout I gave my resume to, and he suggested sushi. don't get me wrong i like the taste of sushi but when i swallow it just stops half way and changes course. so does anyone have any tips of how to keep food you are not fond of down? By the way I am not limiting this topic limited to sushi. There were times when I interned , and I was exposed to eating cow lung which was an Indonesian delicacy.

She is paralyzed on her right side, can't talk very well, and has a poor short term memory. She spent her 16th birthday in a coma. And yes, i'm sure it helped people grow closer to God. But how in the world is this fair. No one even knows if she'll make a full recovery. And I want to keep my faith and be strong, but its just so hard, knowing that He did this to my best friend. If anyone has a good explanation, please share.

20090128221854AAdaHhN	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How does American Girl Get Accepted By Muslim Loves Family?	Hi I met a Muslim man four and a half months ago and he has informed me that he intends to marry me. We are both in our mid twenties. We live in opposite states and speak on the phone frequently. We have not had a traditional courtship or dates, which I know is the norm in Islam. He has told me that I am the only girl he has ever talked to on the phone or looked at. However he informed me that he needs his families approval or he cannot marry me and right now his sister is not accepting of me because she believes that "American women only want him for his family and money". I know she is protective but this feels unfair as he and I have not done anything other than talk. I am also upset because he asked for photos since it has been a while since I have seen him and he in turn sent them to her. The photos for the record are all G-Rated. I want to know how to win her over and show her that I have a good heart. I don't care about money. I only want to be with him. He informed me that she wants to fly here from Dubai and meet me or more like interview me to see what she thinks. I have been studying Islam and am prepared to convert but I am having trouble finding out how to greet her. Do I speak openly with her or give her a gift? Also I have a stud in my nose and is that something I should take out? Should I avoid too much makeup? Do we meet for lunch or tea? What would she most likely prefer? Help I am totally lost! I would appreciate any suggestions especially from Muslim men and women. Anything else you can add would be great. I only have the best intentions with him and I want her to know this.I will be heartbroken if she cannot see my true self. Thanks,

My girlfriend and I have been together for 15 months now, and have had AMAZING sex up until now...it's been a month. Now, before you call me whiney or fill me up with stories about how you haven't had sex in 5 years, in between this month of celibacy, our sexual encounters have been coming along less and less.       There is no doubt in my mind that she is still attracted and in love with me; in fact, I believe fully that our love continues to wax strong and we continue to grow as a couple and as individual persons. However, I went through a major change when I lost my job in october (i haven't been able to work since) I started to feel really down on myself, my confidence level was nearly gone, and i was so self-depricating. I know that was a major turn off to her; but now things have changed. I'm confident, even radiant and she's noticed. I've seen her watching me walk, we've gotten back to some cuddles and we're happier than we've been in a long time, but still when i bring up sex or come onto her, she shuts me down. totally and compleatly, no question about it, we won't be having sex.      is she having issues with her own confidence? is there anything I can do in this situation or do i just wait it out and hope that one morning, afternoon or evening she'll just roll over and decide it's time? Or do i continue to talk with her about it and let her know that i think she's beautiful? I'm so lost, and this is such sensative territory. I'm scared.

But doesn't it seem a bit pointless, to search endlessly (like some euthanasia patients do) for less painless alternatives when it really doesn't matter because you won't feel or remember the pain after you die and it's only a few seconds or minutes of pain anyway?
20090129033217AAX63kS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, I know you don't believe in hell but........?	Do you think for some people hell would be appropriate?       I worked in prison for many years, and some of the people I met were evil.       One guy set a child on fire just to see what happened. One woman abducted a child to give as a gift to her boyfriend. He then tortured her for two days before killing her.      Prison is not good enough for some of these people. They all get TV's in their cells and three square meals a day.      I think hell is a good concept.

20090129032911AACjM3z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christianity origins. "zeitgeist" again?	"I only got three responses when I first asked this ?" (  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  )      In many places all over the world, there are stories similar to the life of Jesus Christ.   (I think I need to warn people) Only if you are not weak minded (spiritually and intellectually) should one watch zeitgeist. If you are dumb you going to be confused.   One of the examples used in the movie is that Christian beliefs can be traced back to Egyptian beliefs and many others.   I found myself thinking about that. Why are there similar stories to Jesus’? Like Horus. That got me thinking; in the Old Testament it predicts Jesus’ life. So what makes the writers of the zeitgeists movie think that all those other accounts that is similar to Jesus’ life is nothing more than a prediction of Jesus’ life?    Are all the stories that are similar to Jesus’ life all just predictions like in the Old Testament? How can my theory be disproved?      Sinner the Agnostic
20090129032747AAZnefL	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Would you consider yourself a failure if you became overweight?	Overweight because of lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet. Why? Because you would feel like you lost control over your weight or because you feel like you are only attractive as a thinner person?      P.S. I am not saying that I would feel that way if I were to gain weight. I am not saying overweight people are failures either. But I know that someone people dread gaining weight above all else, and I want to delve deeper into the reasons for that. Is it a control issue, an issue of looking good or an issue of being healthy?
20090129032709AAgu6nU	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Who can we blame for stereotypes?	This is an honest question for EVERYONE, because stereotypes apply to everyone out there; whether its race, ethnic background, sexual orientation, religion (or lack of), clique, taste, hair color, in general.       Should we blame stereotypes on:    A) The media and/or people who constantly generalize and lump people into categories      or      B) People who perpetuate the stereotypes because they "live the stereotype", a "walking stereotype" because they believe it makes them more of a certain race/ethnicity/sexual orientation/attention seeking.
20090129033829AAZ5oU9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How would your religion and/or belief answer this question?	This question is for everyone of all religions, beliefs (even those with a lack of). How would, spiritually speaking, your religion/belief answer this question?       Which came first? The chicken or the egg?             (Sounds like a silly question at first, but it has a deeper meaning to it than you think). All perspectives are welcome (so long as you try and answer the question).

20090129034144AAhv5mj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you thing of Nostradamus?	I've heard that reading his book of prophecies can actually drive you mad. but if we take for granted that what he says can actually happen then why don't we try to prevent it? (i've heard that he predicted the jfk assassination and 9/11)    Others say that 'associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power'. Does that mean that we can't understand a prophecy until it has been fulfilled? or that we subconsciously connect events with prophecies? and if Nostradamus was just speaking generally then why don't we say the same about prophets during Jesus time? Do we tend to attribute world events to various prophecies out of guilt?

20090129035710AAcoXfc	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT: Really frustrated?	Here my problem. May be a bit of a rant but I need to get this frustration out. Asked this in another section but no answers yet. Besides the LGBT section rocks.      My sister has been very rud lately because of her stressful work. She recently turned 18 and still lives at home. I am 16 and she treats me like dirt most of the time. There's days where she wakes up and everything is fine and treats me like a sister should. My sister is at work and when she isn't she'll go out with her BF.      She barely does anything around the house and her room is always a mess. She leaves her junk around and I end up picking it up. I told Mum how unfair and annoying it is and she spoke to my sister and told her to pick up her mess. It took her 2 days to get around to it! Today she walked into my room after going to the beach and left some black stuff on the carpet by mistake from her dirty feet. Now I have 4 stains in my carpet and no one will help me. I don't know where the products are to clean it and Mum just keeps saying "Dad will do it tomorrow they'll come out." They're pitch black and spread in white carpet! Arg!      This has given me a massive headache. Mum's gotten really lazy and she just won't help me with these stupid problems. Too lazy to get it through my sisters head. I am so angry. Please help me handle my frustration better.
