20070126185155AAcI0iJ	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Weak Thumbs?	Over the past two years I've noticed a steady decline in the strength in both my thumbs, particularly in my left. I play guitar so this is especially as frustrating, because when I play barre chords (they require pressure from the thumb by pushing on the back of the fret board), I can only do it for a short period of time before I have to bow out due to the pain. Lately I've noticed even regular notes are hurting my thumb, which do not require much strength at all. I've noticed it starts hurting when I'm applying pressure and then releasing constantly.       The pain usually resides in the joint at the very bottom of my thum and palm. The tendons surrounding the joint sometimes hurt too. However, sometimes it feels my thumb itself is hurting as well.      I'm only 20 and I did go and see a doctor and physio and they both acted as if it's all in my head. This is incredibly frustrating as it is pushing me further and further way from enjoying my instrument.      Thanks to anyone who can answer.

Now when I was pregant with my first child I had the exterminators come to my apartment and spray for spiders.       Now the exterminator said that I did not have to leave the house or anything like that. So in the summer I would get my house sprayed about twice a week becasue I live by the water and the spiders are too much here. Getting my apartment sprayed twice a week got rid of the spiders good. So I have been getting my apartment sprayed like this for the past 3 years.       So I was pregnant and then I had 2 kids that were exposed to this. I was reading online the other day that this is VERY bad for pregnant women for there babies in their stomach and also for new born babies and babies that are young. It said that it can cause cancer like 7 times more than a baby that has not been exposed to pesticides. I started to worry. I am worrying for no reason?

20090202200937AAzjf4X	Health;Diet & Fitness	How to find meaning in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20081008145841AAeLEj7	Health;Mental Health	My son is in a life threatening depression, how can I get some major help for him?	My son will be 18 next month. He is likely the father of a baby girl born in Sept. (No money for paternity test at this time). He and the mother are not together but they promised we could all see her anytime. What they didn't say was it would always have to be in their house.    We asked to take the baby and mother (if she wanted to go) 8 blocks to my grandmothers and get a 5 generation picture and stay for 2 hours. They said "NO".  because it was "not healthy" but they had already told me they took her to school and let others hold her etc.  We pleaded with them to let my son bond with the baby, instead they sent a (very poorly written)certified letter (not a legal letter) telling us we are not allowed on the property.  I chose to honor their request to avoid complications and give them time to come to their senses in hope of having a relationship with the baby. (we were there when the baby was born) The mother is 16 and lives with her recently unemployed mother in an extremely filthy home. So bad if reported the baby would likely be taken away from them at least temporarily. We are not trying to hurt anyone though. We have given them many things as I wanted to help them and they told me I was a great friend. Now they have owed me $500 for 2 years and have stabbed us in the heart. They sent an email telling me they don't need anything we gave them so they put it all in the garage (which has no doors) and for me to pick it up (which of course I can't do without going on their property).  We may have to go to court to plead our case but we don't have the money to do so as my husband and I commute 2 hours each day for work.   My son has always had issues. He was severly injured when he was 3, he had skin grafs and high fevers and several surgeries. 4 teachers have told me he shows signs of a head injury such as motor skills and mental processing. Some people think he may be bi-polar. Of course I have spoke with the doctors about this and they say even if he does have problems there is nothing that can prove it was from his injury when he was 3 and that there would be no treatment. He has been defiant, he lies, steals, has been diagnosed as ADD and has been through a lifetime of counseling. He has been in placement by my request through a school for children in need of assistance for 1 1/2 yrs. I drove 2 1/2 hrs one way to see him every weekend. He came home only to get into trouble again. He then lived with his 26 yr old brother which he was excited about because he thought his brother was cool and he lived in town not in the country. His brother is a sargeant in the military and he kept my son for 2 yrs. I had him everyother weekend during that time. He ran away for a month and then called me and came to live here again.    Recently he got mad at his teacher in alternative school and poured milk all over her car. He had to clean it and I had to pay because he has had 3 jobs and lost all of them. last week he was caught stealing over the counter medicine and I found out he is taking 20 at a time to get high. I made him go to the police and fill out forms. They say they cannot do anything about it. He came home and my husband and mother had found marajana and more meds in his room. We live in my mothers home she will retire in renovating it for her, so she makes the rules and she kicked my son out. He then asualted my husband (his step dad)   I called the sherriff, police, a judge, the insurance company, mental department and hospital. I had the sherriff pick him up for a "wellness" check. None of them will do anything. It is my understanding that unless he slits his throat or mine or something deadly in front of the doctor nothing can be done. The doctor wouldn't even do a drug test on him.    With that said I am legally responsible for him but he is not allowed in the home I live in. Not only can I not help my son. I cannot see my first grandaughter either. I even wrote to Dr Phil and it has been a month and I have had no response. Today I took his books to school and was going to help him with legal aid about his daughter and an issue he has with losing his liscense and he took the bag of books, discovered that my mother also found his porno which I did not know he had and burned it. He told me he has no family anymore. The only reason he is going to school is because he has to in order to stay at the home he is currently in. I have prayed for him his whole life. Also as bad as he is the babies mother and other grandmother are just as bad. The mom has stolen and lied and the grandmother uses people all the time for money, cel phones, vehicles, food etc. I didn't understand that was what was going on until I had helped then too.  I want what is best for my grandaughter and son. Who can help? I am totally at a loss and stressed beyond explaination. Never ever would have believed all these things could happen in my life for my family. Very sad and frightening. He could be dead or in jail very very soon.

It dropped down to 96 later on and has now gone back up to 97. I am just concerned that I may be sick. Does a 97 degree body tempurature signal any infections or anything?

But ever since I've been diagnosed with GERD pretty much everything I love is a no-no. I love avocados, nachos, lemonade, chocolate and tomatoes, etc.   I don't drink alcohol, smoke or many caffeinated beverages. My doctor prescribed aciphex but I can't afford it right know.      I'm trying to lose weight and hoping  that helps stop the problem, but is there anything else I can do to alleviate the problem and still maybe eat some of my favorite foods,

20081006203415AAfO4z8	Health;Dental	How do you know if you have dry socket?	okay, i had an adult molar tooth pulled on friday, bc it was dead and was hurting me very badly. I am still in severe pain. Also, i feel something inside of it that feels hard and sharp, almost like a piece of  a bone or something. it looks like a red circle (in the socket) and the center of the circle is white. Also, along the sides are white as well. It feels like a canker sore on the edges of the inside (that is the best way to describe the pain).      Does this sound like dry socket? I am also afraid that now i may need the molar tooth directly above it, on the top jaw, pulled as well, as it is hurting very badly, or could this just be a side effect from having the lower molar extracted?      If it is dry socket, do i need to go back to the dentist, or will it heal okay,if i just deal with the pain! i am terrified of the dentist, so i have no idea how long an extracted tooth should hurt for!

I just cannot stop thinking about various questions I come up with, though. Yahoo Answers has been an outlet, but far from a cure. I have tried various mind numbing tasks such as counting sheep, or reading the phone book. No good. My mind seems to wonder while the more simple task carries on with little conscious effort. I have tried white noise, aroma therapy, even Tylenol PM.       Alcohol has worked in the past, but it is not something I want to make a nightly custom. Shy of somehow denying oxygen to my brain, how can I fall asleep faster?

20090108131552AAr3WD7	Health;Diet & Fitness	Only 37 calories in hot chocolate?	Hi, I've been watching really carefully what I'm putting into my body lately, like very carefully. I looked at hot chocolate and I've always thought it's a very unhealthy drink. But today I looked at the hot chocolate in my cupboard and saw per drink it's only 37 calories. Is this legit? I mean, that's very, very surprising considering how many calories are in chocolate. That's under 2% of what the GDA is. In fact most things are low in it, the highest being sugar which is 4.4% of the GDA which isn't too bad. Is hot chocolate actually not that bad? Can it be used as a chocolate substitute when I feel like chocolate? How are the calories so low?

20090203024122AA4U6sY	Health;Men's Health	Do my husband's symptoms indicate a prostate problem?	In the morning when I can hear him urinating, his stream stops and starts, and it sounds like a dribble, not the strong stream you would expect with a full bladder.  He said there is no pain.  I've heard this the last couple days in a row, but it may have been going on longer, I don't usually try to listen!      And this happened once, a few weeks ago:   He got up in the morning to urinate, I don't know exactly what happened but it sounded like he fell down in the bathroom, he may have just kind of lost his balance and fallen into the wall.  When he came out of the bathroom, he seemed really out of it and wouldn't answer questions, he walked into the bedroom door and was trying to leave.  I went over to him, and he lay down on floor for a few minutes.  He was in a cold sweat and said he felt nauseous.   After a few minutes, he got up and got back into bed.  After that he was fine, and that hasn't happened again.  I don't know if this one is related.      Are there other things that can cause a man's urine stream to be weak, or is it pretty much just the prostate?      Thanks!

I realize I toss around language a bit more hastily than I ought to but I fear that I am going to screw myself one of these days. Now the incident was today at school and we were split off into groups and I ended up with this pretentious little thing. So we eventually got into a power struggle over some philosophical thing (can't remember what exactly) and whenever I take a position I am unassailable, you should see me. She was like that too. Well no good could come of this and she eventually said "Listen I'm an honors student." To which I replied this little Gem "Yeah and I'm a psychopath but you don't see me bragging about that. Probably because neither one of those things is very good to mention to people and could certainly not improve ones own appearance." I think it's pretty clever but I admit it was dangerous and a really childish thing to say, I smoothed it over with that little bit on the end. How can I stop trying to earn respect through intimidation?

20090202215441AAqYRuM	Health;Diet & Fitness	Does this diet/exercise experiment sound healthy or dangerous?	I made this up, just to kind of mix a diet with and exercise routine as well as just "normal" eating. (Since I'm Omnivorous, it's kinda hard at time but it gives enough lee-way to not feel deprived.)    From 11am-3pm everyday, I can eat and drink anything I want (not so much to encourage binge eating, but enough time to let me eat a lunch if I have class or something.) Before and after that, I can only eat Fruits, Vegetables, and Seafood, To Drink, Protein water, Protein Shakes, and just plain water.    On the weekends, instead of being 11-3 for my eat anything drink anything time. I can eat and drink anything within the first 6 hours of being awake. (again not to encourage binge eating, just enough to have a breakfast and a lunch)    (Recently, I am discouraging myself from eating after 8... unless I'm starving... Then I'll have something small like an apple or something)    As for exercise, I walk/Jog 2 miles 4-5 days a week. (I haven't toned up enough to jog the hole way, but I'm getting there, at half a mile!)    For 1 to 2 days a week, I go to the gym to work out for about 45 minutes. 10 minutes is cardio, the rest is lifting light weight, just to burn the fat around my muscles, I'm not really aiming to gain muscle, just lose weight.    (BTW, the protein shake is lean body)    It's been 3 weeks, my Wii says that I have lost about 4 pounds. - I took a week off because I was sick... so about 2 pounds a week.    But does this sound like a healthy, or a dangerous, diet?

20090202202516AA1lQ5k	Health;Mental Health	Effects of acupuncture on depression?	My grandmother is 82 and has a rare disease I can't spell.  It behaves as though someone put dimensia and Parkinson's disease in a blender and then poured it inside your head.  It slows the neurons in your brain and slowly paralyzes the muscles behind your eyes so that they can't move, as well as extreme memory loss, loss of balance, and depression.  There is no cure but my grandmother has lost all hope and has given up on life, often telling us that she is ready to die.  I'm not looking for miracles but the medication she is on now is not helping her depression at all.  I want to know if anyone has tried acupuncture to treat their depressions, and what the specific effects were.  Like I said, I'm not looking for a miracle, I just want her to be slightly less miserable than she is now.

But these work! Normally when you sit on the couch all day and eat and watch tv you gain weight throughout the day right? Not me!      (this isn't just some weird phenomenon, right?         Just thought I'd share this info with everyone....      What's worked for you?

Las normas que rigen mi vida son muy diferentes a las de la mayoría de las personas. (no me jacto ni me siento superior, solo diferente) sucedió y ya.    Fue en  la escuela, fue mi primera vez  y creo que apenas estaba decidiendo inconcientemente si esta persona me gustaba o no.    Pero de cualquier modo me generó un malestar emocional y moral posterior. no creo haberle fallado a alguien más que a mí. ha pasado algún tiempo y no le he visto pero no dejo de pensar en eso, a veces como si hubiera ganado un trofeo por dejarme ser y otras como si hubiera perdido una guerra...     tiendo a la depresión y padezco soledad. esperaría cualquier opinión pero una muy objetiva me ayudaría...    parece que no es para tanto pero ?pueden ver el alcance?
