20090131111353AA5QLKw	Health;Diet & Fitness	Best method to loose weight?	Hey, I'm overweight (very much so- 250 lbs). I don't eat very often. I probably 't eat until 2 in the afternoon and if I remember I'll only eat like once a day sometimes. I'm in school again while I work as a nurse and I've tried everything I know to loose weight but it doesn't seem to work with me. I've tried the counting the calories and I'll lose weight but we all know that you just gain it back again. I work a lot and don't have time to exercise like I would like to . I just wanted to know if anyone else has ever weighed this much and been able to loose it and how did you do it? I'm really tired of being like this.

I've always just used tampons, and pads, so I'm new to these.       I know there are different sizes, but are some brands bigger than another brand? I know the keeper lasts for 10 years, but what about the others?       Are they easy to use?    I know this is kinda gross, but I have trouble with leaking during the night. I sleep with  tampons, pads, and a towel. Would  a menstrual cup leak during the night like the tampons do?       Any advice on these would be great. Thanks.

20090131112943AAziPL2	Health;Diet & Fitness	Watch Me Diet: What Are You Going to Eat During the Superbowl:-)?	Even though I don't follow football, I'm always psyched for Superbowl parties. The commercials! The yelling at the TV! The endless bowls of chips!  Here's how I'm going to ensure that I don't go overboard...      If I know I'm going to an event where the food will be fatty, salty and irresistible, I have a healthy snack right before I leave the house, like an apple with almond butter or a whole wheat pita with hummus. Yes, it's counterintuitive--the goal is to eat less and lose weight, after all--but if I'm not ravenous, it's much easier to have just a mini-plate of snacks, and not go back for seconds or thirds. And since I'm not much of a beer drinker, it's easy for me to say no to the suds. I also try to sit close to the TV and as far away from the buffet table as possible.

20090131130144AA92n7t	Health;Diet & Fitness	How to increase metabolic rate ?	Firstly, I'd like more than some simple wikipedia pastes.      Right, I'm not exactly what is wrong with me but I've developed an obsession with being skinnier. I'm not really fat to be honest, I know that, I just feel like I should be smaller. About two years ago I started this thing, I made a point to stop eating altogether. Since then I've gotten worse, I've gotten obsessed, like I feel like I am not supposed to be this size, after doing research I realised that starving yourself only makes you put on more weight - I'm trying to stay away from doing it all again. I just don't think I'd be able to stop thinking about my weight until I stop seeing fat! Last summer holidays, 2008, I started on an crazy regime, I swam every morning, constantly for half an hour to an hour, and ate healthily, I felt much better being skinny, if only my legs would be smaller, oh and I could've kept it going, I just got stressed one evening and I gave up altogether. So yeah, I'd appreciate it if you had any ideas on how to lose weight. Also, I do harmful things towards myself when I'm stressed, upset, angry, etc.         Thanks in advance :) x

I know how stupid this will be to nearly if not all of you, but maybe there is one that will see my call and be of the help I need. I have suffered from ana/mia since being in the ninth grade. It has never been like in the movies my will power fades, or the fear of what is happening to me becomes too real, and I force myself to be "healthy" but i binged out instead. This has been my life a week or so with ana, then mia takes over for a month. Then I go back to ana for a few days and get scared. Then just being a fat over eating ***** takes over. And you know when you eat, even if you are fat you don't shake. You are not cold. You can eat with people you love. You don't have to hide.   So anyways the fat ***** thing lasts the longest. sure sometimes I will do the healthy thing, but it just turns into ana. I have no ******* will power, sorry.   Well if the fat thing last the longest you can guess what my body looks like now, FAT. OBESE even. I am not seeing myself as fat, but really I am skinny, I am FAT.   Anyways point of the story is Last night I decided to give ana another go, and to honour her, make it official, I have decided to do a three day fast just like the commandments say I must. But I know where this will end. The fear is spreading again...so many thoughts, questions running through my head. 'What if I don't come back this time?' What if I starve myself, put myself through hell, and I end up back to where I am now, but worse, or even fatter?' I am a horrible person who doesn't deserve your help nor advice, but I am asking. I am hungry and I know during day three I will be very fatigued. What should I do. I don't know how to be healthy, so that is not an option. Ana Mia or Fat ***?   Please help me.

Then it ended the 27th in the morning around 9am. Then it came back the 30th and now today's the 31 and its 8:35 and my period is gone again. is it possible to have two periods. Did i have my period because its trying to regulate my body? Can someone help me? Oh and the doctor put me on birth control so that it regulates m period so that my husband and i could have a baby.                And i missed two days the first time i started and then i missed two again.

20090131173441AAcJ0hd	Health;Mental Health	Will the pain i feel & images ever go?	My husband & i have been married for 5 months and have been dating for 2 years.We got married with just the two of us when we went away together. Im a hairdresser in a major salon who works really hard and has to travel into the city where i grew up for my job, my job is like my run away place. We both could never get enough of each other then he became very distant with me now i know why, he had a one night stand last month and i only found out about it. He tells me he is crazy about me as he tells me everyday and writes songs about me. Our sex life is amazing, but i stopped the sex for now is that good? as the imagine of him inside someone else makes me sick to my stomach.I cant look at him with out crying and thinking of how he hurt me.He still treats me like im the only thing that matters to him, but right now i couldn't care.I grew up in foster care and now i feel i have nothing..again. My best friends are in NY where im from and i go to them when i can just to get away from it all. I was thinking of a divorce but maybe i should think about all this a little more. I wish i could make him feel the pain i am in. Should i end it or just stay & see how it goes?

At the end of the procedure, after I got a pair of lenses to fit my eyes well, I have 3 pairs of lenses. This is because the doctor ordered a next pair after I tried a pair out, until we found the perfect fit.      However the company is making me send back the 2 extra pairs I back. These extra pairs are perfectly usable for me. I know the company isn't gonna re-use them in any way. They just making me give it back cuz they want me to pay for more lenses, and they are really expensive.      What I want to know is if anyone knows where I can get some old rigid lenses, or something that looks identical to a hard contact lens, and send those back in place.      Really reaching here, does anyone have a brilliant idea?      I cant say I lost em, they just gonna charge me for them.

Over a course of 2 months my bf has been complaining of stomach aches, when he eats candy, sweets, milk etc.   But lately, he's been complaining of pains, and he even told me he thinks he has a hernia.   The weird thing is, when we fool around and when he ejaculates he complains of extreme pain, like a burning sensation, and he says it hurts to have an orgasm.   One time, about a week ago, i gave him oral sex, and when he ejaculated he said it really hurt, and he could not enjoy it.   He does not have an STD if that's what youre thinking, we've been tested. I'm just wondering if it's a hernia because often a sign of a hernia is Dyspareunia - a pain during or after sexual contact. And since a  hernia is a hole in the abdominal wall..could the reason that its hurting be that everytime he does ejaculate he feels extreme pressure?       Thanks for your help!

I've had this very painful, sharp, stabbing feeling in the lower part of my right rib cage for about 3 days. It hurts horribly whenever I move even the slightest bit, and I can feel it's definitely pressed further in than my left ribs. Normally, I've got two dimple type indentations at the bottom of both sides of my rib cage in the skin because my lower ribs poke out some. But recently, my right one seems to be pressed in more and hurts like bloody hell. Could it be serious growing pains? A gas bubble? Any suggestions on relieving the pain?

Sex: Female   Age: 15 yrs   Height: 5 feet 6 inches   Weight: 180 lbs      History:   Up until recently I used to eat very large portions, snack regularly before dinner and before bed. I didn't exercise very much; it was rare actually if i did. I drank at least 2 or 3 sodas a day, and I wasn't getting my daily values; I lacked many things.      Now:    I eat less, but still eat all 3 meals. I stopped drinking soda or any sort of sugary beverage or caffeine. I've only been drinking milk, or water. I stopped the snacking almost completely unless it was healthy snack. I exercise for at least 20 minutes every day and for my cardio I roller skate for about 95 minutes once a week.  I eat much more healthier food like fruits or veggies. I really don't eat any more cakes or chips.       So far in the past week I have lost about 3 pounds, and I hope to get my weight done to about 140-150 lbs.      Am I on my way to a healthy start? Is there anything else I should be doing?

However I also experience an increase in nightmares during sleep, which I normally never have.  Has anyone experienced this effect too? What could be the reason? Will this effect persist in the long term, or is it just temporary? Thanks. 
20081110081422AAVubcE	Health;Alternative Medicine	Which one is better: niacinamide (nicotinamide) or niacin (nicotinic acid)?	Niacin is available over-the-counter in 3 different forms. While I've been able to rule out the inositol hexanicotinate form because of its dubious health benefits, I am having a harder time choosing between plain niacin (nicotinic acid) and its amide form niacinamide (nicotinamide). While niacinamide does not cause a flush, some sites claim that only the flush-causing niacin really has heath benefits. However niacinamide is also reviewed very positively in other sites, and wikipedia even claims that it can have some positive effects on Alzheimer patients. If you have any more information that would tip the balance either way, please let me know. Thanks

20090225220613AAuNnUd	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Is it possible to have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome without swollen lymph nodes, fevers, or any tender points?	Cause I've been getting these strange since may 2007. It started about 2 months after I became sick with a extremely bad flu or some kind of intestinal illness. I do have floating stools also (steatorrhea). They tested the levels for Celiac disease before, and all was fine except for the AGA (Antigliadin Antibodies). They were slightly elevated. I'm not sexually active, so it's not an STD. My WBC count was slightly elevated before (like 10.9). Nothing too serious though, my doctor said. I've lost 14 pounds (more gradual than rapid though). I haven't been eating a lot lately, but I still eat. Plus, I never use to lose all this weight, even when I didn't eat that much when I was younger. I've been having a lack of appetite (but I've been like that off and on since I was young). My doctor said I should try a 2,000 calorie diet and see if I gain weight but so far, my clothes are still looser. I'm only 20  years old, female, and some days I feel like I'm about 80 (muscle cramps, shortness of breath, muscle aches, stabbing pains, cognitive problems, bowel and bladder issues, muscle weakness, fatigue, sleep problems, weight changes, joint pain, etc...)      I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (a connective tissue disorder on 4/3/08) so my doc think my symptoms could be coming from that. But I'm always wondering, why all of a sudden would these other symptoms start popping up out of the blue? It makes it even more strange that it started about 2 months after I got sick. What do you all think it could possibly be?       Thanks!

A few months ago I was just like any other young woman, going to to a great college, having fun with friends, going to parties, dating, loving life.

Is this what a normal period should feel like? Not that I am complaining, but I am soon about to get pregnant and I wanted to know if that was normal or if I should ask my doctor about it.

I just checked my pressure (we have a monitor at home) three times:   First Reading:   97/62 with 85 pulse      Second:   97/56 pulse 87      Third **:   84/60 pulse 80      It seems my dia is perfect, however systolic is extremely low. Maybe the third got really low because I was sitting at rest for 5 min prior to checking it? I often have spells where I get very dizzy, lose my vision because everything turns black, and extreme pressure when I stand up. But, that's normal, right? I have been getting that all my life, so has my sister. But what does my low systolic indicate?

I'm looking into some individual health care plans for myself, so I can get out of my own soon, hopefully. I was just wondering if my gynecologist visits would fall under "specialist care." I know my cardiologist will, but... The gynecology?      I mean, I suppose it would be, but I would see that as a basic care, myself - we gotta have it! I already know my birth control wouldn't be covered under the plans I'm looking at (I can't afford much), but that I can deal with. It's the actual visits that worry me.
20090131155759AAz8qWm	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	NyQuil Causes me to stop breathing?	I had a cold about a week ago and couldn't sleep, so I took a regular dose of NyQuil. After about forty five minutes it started kicking in and I went to bed, but as soon as I was starting to fall asleep I noticed that I wasn't breathing, so I woke up startled and had to intentionally breathe. So this happened a few more times and I finally decided to stay up because I didn't want to.. well maybe die?! :o I hope not. I have never had any other breathing problems like sleep apnea or anything. Also, no other drugs or alcohol were in my system. What is in the NyQuil that has this effect? Can I take a different brand of cold medicine next time?

She has dropped out of college and now works full time in retail. However all her work is pointless because she doesn't save her money, and just blows it on useless things like cab rides and dinners out on the town. She works all day, then goes out with her "friends" each night to binge drink. She has also began experimenting with hard drugs, which is very unlike her. She has told me that she is "tired of day-to-day life" and if she could find a "good" way of committing suicide, she would do it. I have tried talking with her about getting help, but she says she will only confide in me, and would never talk about it with a psychologist. She sees no future for herself, and doesn't want to continue living. I am really scared for her, but I don't know what to do.

She tells me she doesn't feel anything anymore, she is sad, doesn't appreciated life and she "hardly feels anymore for" me.

My love letters don't make her feel good anyone, she always talks down and because of all of this she isn't the woman I asked to marry me.  I told her I support her and I am there for her and I love her.  She doesn't talk to me, I carry the conversation, she doesn't like what she did like, she just isn't her.  She was very depressed when she left me to go back to NV on the 2nd of Sept.  I need help.  I want my fiancee BACK!
