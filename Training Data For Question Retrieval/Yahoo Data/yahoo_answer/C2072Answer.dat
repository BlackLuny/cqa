It's supposed to be about gaining knowledge and not a chat room.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	I disagree.  This is still an open format and persons need to be able to ask what ever they want without some on epolicing them as long as they do not break the rules.  Some person are just learning the system and may need time to develop other skill.  Who are we to be YA nazis and say what they can or cannot ask when in fact it is up to the answerer to do so if they choose.  Just my humble opinion.|`|sUKKnd6Raa	i agree with you ron =P|`|RCXUN9ctaa	your question is exactly the type of questions that are making yahoo answers ''garbage''|`|FMqEkEAqaa	anybody can ask anything they want to

Khzi78ciaa	Yes you could do that.    a) If you want to send an e-mail which is already sent then go to your "Sent" folder and open the mail. Just forward the mail.    b) If you want to send an e-mail and a copy to someone else also then you have to use CC or BCC options available.  When you are composing the e-mail if you cannot see CC or BCC boxes then click on show CC and BCC.  Type in the addresses in TO box to send e-mail to.  Type in the addresses in CC box if you want to send same e-mail as copies to someone else also.  Type in the addresses in BCC box if you want to send same e-mail as blind copies to someone else also.  By doing this you will just send one e-mail to multiple addresses.    Addresses in TO - Everyone in this box can see each others e-mail address including addresses in CC box but not addresses in BCC box.  Addresses in CC - Everyone in this box can see each others e-mail address including addresses in TO box but not addresses in BCC box.  Addresses in BCC - Everyone in this box can see e-mail addresses in TO and CC boxes but can't see addresses in BCC box itself.    All the best!

That is for sure. When and how? Only God (if he/she/it/they exist(s)) would know.    Yadda yadda yadda prophecies, yadda yadda yadda prophets, yadda yadda yadda visions, yadda yadda yadda meh.    Are you worried that the end of the world is near?   Why? If you believe in whatever "scriptures" you're reading, then you "know" that there will be very few survivors after "The great cataclysm". Or no survivors at all if the world is going to be completely annihilated.    If you're a religious person, then you know that if you die and have been "a good person" (accordingly to your religion), you'll go to "Paradise". I presume you're a good person. So, if you die, you'll go to paradise. No worries.    Now, if you survive, you'll have a hard time, with the food shortage and wars and whatnot. So why would you worry about surviving?    Now, if you're not a religious person, then you know that if you die, wether or not you've been a good person, you just die. You go nowhere. And you'll eventually die, so what's the fuss? If you survive, you'll still have to worry about food shortage and wars and whatnot and then die.    So, after all, we're all going to die.

xxS74ZsMaa	probably someone was offended and flagged ur question<br>  and maybe yahoo answers agreed and thought it was offensive|`|6fMkFzosaa	My question was removed as well and all I asked was who the hot Andrew Marc model was. <br>  <br>  I've heard there is someone going around flagging anything they don't like. It seems as though Yahoo would take more into consideration then a couple of flags. <br>  <br>  As for your question I think you are well within your right to ask.<br>  I suppose I could be considered fat. And I don't like it. Unfortunately some of us aren't lazy or over eaters. Some people just have a very hard time loosing body fat. If I go to gym every day and keep my calories to around 1200 every single day I can maintain. I work full time, I have three children. And I have several outside hobbies which makes it difficult to watch those calories even though I try very hard. I also make sure I get to the gym three times a week but I still hover right around 170. That said I am a very happy, outgoing, secure LIBERAL individual...lol. <br>  I hope I was able to answer both of your questions. Have a great day!|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	Well I'm a liberal (thank you VERY much 1st answer) and I am fat.  I don't mind being called fat- I am!  As long as it is not in a ridiculing way, I'm cool with it.  TOo be technical, the conservatives insured this result, I would know.<br>  <br>  And for some they have always been over weight and are still young (yet obease) and are trying to diet, or working on how because they never knew different.  To others ieating is an addiction like drugs, sex, getting high.  Others do it bc they are bored, and some are genetically screwed (beleive it or not.)  My family is naturallyy 20 lbs bigger, but I am too overweight (250lbs) but I am talll so I dont look too bigg, but anyways, I am dieting, but it takes time and effort.|`|IEZoHcysaa	It's not even worth of going into, you wouldn't understand.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	it's decided by the community for  betterment of our community|`|GrLIOUDgaa	Read the guidelines, it was insulting.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	You may not see it as so, but it is insulting to overweight people.  You are making a biased generalization with the "if they didn't like it, they would be thin".  Being overweight can be caused by many reasons including genetics, illness, food supply, stress, and lack of willpower.  Your generalization will imply to some, all overweight people basically have a mental defect or they would not be overweight.<br>  <br>  Now if you had asked "What are the reasons overweight people are overweight?", then you would be ok. Try to stay away from absolute generalizations.  All of them are going to be insulting to somebody.|`|spFmMOL2aa	well, it is a very na?ve question. only a youth would ask it. It's like saying if you don't want to grow old, just stay young. <br>  I know this is beyond your comprehension now, but as you get older, you'll remember this and say "oh yea".<br>  <br>  but they have been breaking in new yahoo workers at lower pay scales, and they have been deleting everything.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	The question comes off as rather thoughtless and inconsiderate.<br>  <br>  Most overweight people do not like being overweight, primarily for the rude words and actions directed at them. Many have tried to lose the weight, but they are discouraged by the lack of results and the (again) endless comments they endure|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Because stupid liberals want to censor everything everyone says.  Its too politically incorrect.  To call someone fat, homosexual etc.  Thank the liberals for that one..NWO here we come.

Your question is "Why is the sequence of my question in the wrong order?"  That is ALWAYS where the question goes.  Then you add details, which ALWAYS appear beneath the question.  It doesn't matter what other question you might ask. The question belongs in that first field you fill you when you first click on "ask".  There's no way anything else can appear before it.

7u77AiBjaa	Many people have asked questions about this issue (particularly during the last few weeks). This feature is frequently glitchy (going missing, sharp reductions in numbers, resetting to zero, and etc.), thus it's notoriously unreliable. There really is nothing that you can do about it and Yahoo will not help you personally. This could be a temporary (most likely) or permanent problem. You can't reset or modify the feature yourself beyond setting permissions. Personally, I pretend the feature doesn't exist, but I did check and I do have the same problem occurring.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can try the following to see it will help your problem, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  1) Refresh your Home or My Page several times.

It lasted about ten seconds. My only guess is that an open web page somehow checked for any open web mail, found Yahoo and hijacked my session - sending an email to all contacts then erasing them.<br>  <br>  Colour me unimpressed.

At the same time I want some privacy and I would care less about what they might think of me.  But again, it's better to keep it private.    ^__^|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I had mine open until about 6 months ago. When I left mine open, trolls would spam each of my questions and leave rude comments. They would also report every single question, when my questions obeyed the community guidelines. Now that I keep it private, it doesn't happen anymore.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	For many, they are 'stalked' on this site by some of the less friendly users, who try to report them for any tiny infraction of the rules that they can. To prevent this, many of the users hide their Q&A.     For others, they are 'trolls' (people that post inflammatory Q&A simply to incite the other users) and they keep their things private so people won't catch on to that fact.    It kind of makes it hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys, doesn't it?|`|FurFahkEaa	Because some people are nosy and try to find out too much about you. And i dont want trolls reading any personal feelings i may have expressed in previous questions|`|IsGo50kqaa	Many have low self esteem and are saddened when someone disagrees with them so they block anyone who does or form what amounts to a private club.  No big deal; its a free country(more or less).|`|CB15kchkaa	because some nasty people on here troll you. They follow you around by checking your Q and A's, and basically give you a hard time.    P.S. If someone has hidden their Q& A's, if you add them as a contact, then refresh the page, all will be revealed !|`|Tgqji3lLaa	Maybe they don't want creeps reading what they have said on a specific topic or asking personal questions.|`|9Zdt7E56aa	Because sometimes I give tiny personal details in my answers, I don't want anybody to see more than that one detail.|`|AA12196812	Because there are some vindictive weirdos on here. When they disagree with your opinion, they may start pursuing you personally. The most innocent things that they'd do in that case is just give you thumbs down and report your answers to all other questions.     But they might also try piecing your identity out of the bits that you inevitably disclose.|`|ljWqn7Zhaa	its so those bloody trolls cant 'track' you (go on every single one of your questions and fill it with mindless crap answers)|`|BO28Mn8haa	because sometimes we ask personal questions, that we'd rather people not look back on later. we asked them at the time for advice, and now we would like them in the past.     later|`|623ac02d466970adca4c822734aabb3faa	It must be to have more privacy. . . . ,|`|bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	Some of us hide our Q & A's because we might answer or ask questions on somewhat controversial topics where others may disagree with your point of view very greatly.  Examples include, animal rights, homosexuality, religion, the Israel/Gaza war, and more.    Sometimes those people who disagree, will go to the extent of reading every question and answer you have posted and then clicking the "report abuse" button on every one of your answers.  This results in a whole bunch of violations being accrued on your user account only because someone disagreed with one of your questions or answers.    Yahoo Answers has an automated system whereby, in some cases, you only need one abuse report to cause you to receive a violation.  In others, you may need more than one abuse report to receive a violation.  Yahoo Answers isn't clearly indicating how many abuse reports it takes to get a violation, nor how they review reports when an objection is raised.    Some individuals have posted very innocent questions or answers and still received violation notices which do not seem to have any rhyme or reason, and raising an objection to the fairness of the report does little good.  The response most people receive is that the violation stands as is.    If you choose, you can still keep your Q&A's available to be seen by your friends on your contacts list.

We miss you Razna :-( and wish to see you again :-)    edit : plz don't go|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	I don't think you can cancel it, Razna. You can close down everything in your network. Get rid of all your contacts and fans.   Eventually after a few months it will be canceled for you. But firstly, if that is what you want. Leave absolutely nothing which is evident of you - even make your avatar gray - That way, the system will discover at its' time that you no longer are part of it.    I am telling you what has been told to me. You can ask Yahoo yourself. I'd do that, preferably.  I'll miss you, but I have no right whatsoever in intervening with what you may feel is best for you to do.   Good Luck! I am one who's appreciated you, your answers, and your ability to write.  Sincerely, Grecia.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Only the YA team can DELETE your account. Closing your EMAIL ID deactivates the YA account, but you also lose everything attached to that email account. After 4 months, the YA profile WILL disappear. But ALL Q&A from that profile are still visible & searchable on site. IN VOTING or RESOLVED Q&A remain the property of Yahoo.    Blank out your avatar, nickname and 'About Me'.   Close links to 360, IM or email.   Delete open questions and answers.  Set Network and Q&A to private.   Then just leave.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Well, you could post something really scathing or hateful and then it would get suspended, but I don't know if you can acutally terminate your own account.  Do you mean you want to delete all your Q&A too?  Otherwise, just don't use it anymore is all I can think to do.    Edit:  I am very sorry......sorry to see you go.  =(|`|5l2kTANaaa	You cannot Razna.    I asked the same question before. Unless as stated before you ask stg so outrageous that your account get suspended. Your questions and answers will remain though...( still get BA for some of my first account lol !)

But I don't see the link between avoiding Yahoo Answers and taking better care of your computer.  Are you sure your not trying to exorcise it?  I strongly recommend a second opinion.    Edit: If what you have been told is that YA has a tracking device, the are partially wrong. Yahoo! has a tracking device so you will still have to accept cookies from Yahoo! if you keep your Yahoo mail account. Most malware programs will find this cookies and flag them as spyware but if you delete them they will come back next time you log into Yahoo! to check your e-mail. You can't opt out either because Yahoo! won't work.|`|bc7faa9e761703d136be8850a74f17b2aa	Would you please stay on?

You can have fun, but the functional part has to come first. Imagine questions where 50-100 people were having "fun" answering it. The asker would get nothing useful." (Author: Badhabyt - http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind... )    Essentially Yahoo! Answers is about asking and answering sensible questions.

6qsTmMQaaa	CARTOON AVATAR:    1. Go to your profile.    2. Click on the button near the top that says EDIT INFO.    3. You should see three boxes. All the way to the right, there should be a box that says "Use my Yahoo! Avatar", and then right beneath a button that says "Edit My Yahoo! Avatar".     4. Click it.    5. It will take you to the link.    OR...    Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage.

Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!    To get it to show up    1. Go to your profile    2. Click "Edit My Info"    3. You will be taken to a page where you will see three boxes.

CARTOON AVATAR:    1. Go to your profile.    2. Click on the button near the top that says EDIT INFO.    3. You should see three boxes. All the way to the right, there should be a box that says "Use my Yahoo! Avatar", and then right beneath a button that says "Edit My Yahoo! Avatar".     4. Click it.    5. It will take you to the link.    OR...    Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage. Make sure you're logged on. =)    PICTURE AVATAR:    You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient.    ~~~~    If you want to post a link to a picture, you need to copy and paste the link into the answer box, or the question box. However, due to the 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you post the question or answer.|`|gIszhbQNaa	If you mean an Avatar, listen to the two above me.

5KxklhJCaa	If you have an attorney generally you should follow their advice.<br>  Are you asking these questions of your attorney?<br>  Is your attorney able to answer your questions?<br>  If not perhaps you need to seek a more qualified attorney.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have not been released to work by the doctor then of course you shouldn't be going back to work yet. <br>  If the doctor has released you then he/she should be in contact with you and the caseworker and have you at MMI or have you on limited duty until you reach MMI. If the employer cannot offer limited duty that meets the doctor’s requirements then you stay on TPD and continue to draw the temporary benefits amount each week.<br>  As soon as you reach MMI a PPD percentage will be set and a settlement should be offered within 30 days of the date of the PPD being set. Once an offer is made your attorney will be able to negotiate for a larger settlement (within the states guidelines) and this is usually completed within another 30 days. The administrative judge will see you and review the settlement ask a few questions and generally if all the paperwork is in order your attorney will receive a check that day. In some states the attorney must hold the check in escrow for 3 days before you receive your funds. <br>  <br>  So once you are at MMI and your PPD is set, within 90 days (usually less) you generally have your money. All this can vary by state and the complexities of your particular case. <br>  <br>  If you are paying, even on contingency, an attorney to represent you they should be explaining this process and answering all of your questions. If they are not you need to seriously consider finding more suitable counsel.<br>  <br>  You can click on my profile and then e-mail me if I may be of assistance.

You've got a ways to go yet.  You need 119 MORE points to hit level 2.<br>  <br>  All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.

Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.<br>  <br>  Hints: <br>  <br>  answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)<br>  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)<br>  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)<br>  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)<br>  you also get a point a day for signing in<br>  <br>  each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|y6406A92aa	Levels are determine by how many points you earn by answering questions, voting for undecided questions, and getting Best Answers.<br>  <br>  Level 1. 1 - 249 points<br>  Level 2. 250 - 999 points<br>  Level 3. 1,000 - 2,499 points<br>  Level 4. 2,500 - 4,999 points<br>  Level 5. 5,000 - 9,999 points<br>  Level 6. 10,000 - 24,999 points<br>  Level 7. 25,000+|`|jAhFXjfdaa	Level 1. 1 - 249 points<br>  Level 2. 250 - 999 points<br>  Level 3. 1,000 - 2,499 points<br>  Level 4. 2,500 - 4,999 points<br>  Level 5. 5,000 - 9,999 points<br>  Level 6. 10,000 - 24,999 points<br>  Level 7. 25,000+<br>  <br>  Just my guide for future ones.|`|Gem96NQyaa	You don't have enough points.

Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail.
