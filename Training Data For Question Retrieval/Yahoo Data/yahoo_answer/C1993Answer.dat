xTioPxaVaa	You're going to have to go a little more than $50 bucks for a set of Tele replacement pickups if you want anything that's actually going to be an improvement over what you've already got in there.<br>  <br>  Seymour Duncan makes several replacement pickups for Tele, depending on whether you want a vintage or hot rodded sound.  But, they cost betwen $60 - $90.<br>  <br>  Joe Barden pickups are also very popular Tele replacements.  They're also very pricey, at about $160 each!<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to get the guitar and play it for a while.  Maybe the pickups in it will be acceptable to you.  <br>  <br>  I know that Saga guitars are not real expensive, and I always discourage people from putting a lot of money into an inexpesive guitar (you'll never recover it).  It's better to save your money and get a better guitar later on.<br>  <br>  True story...I was working part time in a music store in Killeen, TX many years ago.  This kid brought in a $200 Ibanez guitar.  He wanted me to do the following to it:<br>  <br>   - Install active pickups ($190)<br>   - Change out the tremelo to a true Floyd Rose  ($210)<br>   - Route a "monkey grip" in the body like the Steve Via guitars ($375)<br>   - Refret the neck with larger frets ($275)<br>  <br>  So...$650 into a $200 guitar?  I showed him a couple of guitars on the wall that would give him almost all of what he wanted for less money, but he was insistant.<br>  <br>  Something didn't smell right, so I asked how he was going to pay for it, and he whipped out a credit card.  I called to check on the card, found out it was his dad's and called him.  He hit the roof because his son told him he just wanted to get a set of strings at the store.<br>  <br>  The dad was there 10 minutes later, and the last thing I remember was the dad motioning for the son to come outside.  <br>  <br>  Neither were ever seen again.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|aIdOMU1caa	A great site for upgrade parts for these less expensive guitars is:<br>  <a href="http://store.guitarfetish.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://store.guitarfetish.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  They have their own brand of pickups (GFS) which sound really good for the money.<br>  <br>  SInce you didn't say what kind of music you play, I really can't suggest a particular set.
e7KoyoWsaa	there are a few different axim models, and they are getting a little out of date.  some have wifi, others just bluetooth.  take the model number and go to the pocket pc website.  look through the FAQ and see uif its possible.  if it is, there should be step by step instructions<br>  mind you, you will need to be within range of a wireless network.
o6BDapZjaa	You can call 1-800-MYiPhone to reach their technical care.|`|jkDawQVNaa	call your cell phone provider also turn off your phone for a while and see what happen make sure you didnt drop it on the floor or in water cause that can be it. and phones with alot of features like that tend to freeze alot. maker sure you have insurance on it<br>  !|`|gdzWemJaaa	Hold down the power button at the same time you hold onto the home button.  That will reboot it.  It should be good after that.  Otherwise, you may have a bad application on it.
0vsvd3YKaa	the ipod touch is great if you want to watch video. i too had a 2gen ipod nano, and then i got a 2gen ipod touch 16gb, and i don't regret it. it does so much more, and was definately worth the $$$. its thin, got a built in speaker that workes pretty well, its got wifi, games, etc.... no, i dont think the price will be going down anytime soon, considering it was released just 5 months ago. As for the internet browser, it workes magicaly :P it lookes the exact same as the browser on the iphone, and allows you to go on websites and look at them like you would on a computer screen. it workes really well! To use the internet, youtube, mail, and other wifi apps, you must have a wifi connection going in your house/appartment. So NO, you don't have to pay extra for the use of the browser, youtube, etc.. as long as you are in a wifi area (for example if you don't have wifi and you neighbor does, just steal their connection and use it :P). And for your last question, i would reccomend 16gb, as the space fills up pretty quickly, and with 8gb, you'll have room for maybe 1000 songs and 1 movie MAX. 16gb gives you more double the room for $100 more, and is a worthy investment.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|YNJsvtlQaa	Okay NOT AN iTouch, thats if you jailbroken it, and yes the iPod Touch 2g is one of the best investments i've ever made, i was gonna pick a xbox 360 over it, and i think they are about the same, because the ipod has over 2000 apps! which 1000 of them are FREE!  And it plays video like HD, or close to HD!!!!  The internet browser works with a WiFi connection!!!!! no paying for it, unless the wifi connection is yours, then your paying for it, and youtube, part of internet, free unless wifi is your, mail internet , but the gigs its all up to what your using them for i have a 16gb ipod touch 2g and it rules, i have about 4 movies on it 150 3 minute podcasts, and  12 TV shows, 400 songs, and 150 apps! and i have like 4 gigs of space left!!! Make that great decision, and DON'T jailbreak it, that voids the free 1 year warranty you get with every ipod you buy at a retail store, or the apple store online!! jailbreak = voided warranty and a slow ipod that has bugs, and viruses.

i5OVORXgaa	Pretty much same-oh same-oh... they both have the same min and max shutter speeds... I suggest you go to your local camera store and check both out... hold them in your hands, play with them, see which one you're more comfortable with.<br>  <br>  Here's a side-by-side comparison if you want to look further into it:<br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=canon_eos400d%2Cnikon_d60&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a>|`|W0AK2Lumaa	Either it depends on your len AND YOUR SKILLSs ...|`|pZGLhV2Waa	They are both fine. What matters is the lens you choose. The camera itself matter very little. For fast moving wildlife or anything for that matter you want the fastes lens you can afford. By fast I mean the largest aperture or (smallest F number). You will also want a telephoto lens. Either a 55-200 VR or 70-300mm should be good in bright day light. In low light they will be a little slow. Fast lenses cost a lot of money though so examine your budget. Professional wildlife photographer use lenses that cost thousands of dollars.
i5OVORXgaa	Nikon D40 or Canon Rebel XT are good for beginners.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I recommend Nikon D60. <br>  <br>  This camera is designed for newcomers to DSLRs and Nikon wants you to feel at home with this camera. The size and weight is just slightly more than a deluxe point-and-shoot with lots more options for those who want to take photography more seriously. <br>  <br>  Among the major reasons for buying this camera is its sharp pictures due to Nikon's lens technology which now includes a vibration reduction lens to keep your photos steady. The sensor cleaner is a big plus to keep those images clear. You have the option of using the camera on automatic or trying out many of Nikon's built-in options for editing your shots. <br>  <br>  $546.95 + Free Shipping<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6G/dp/B0012OGF6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236489369&sr=1-1&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digit...</a>|`|AA12114566	I am planning on buying a DSLR.

You can never go wrong with a Nikon D40!|`|IY9JolQ4aa	I'd say Nikon D40 or D60. I'm partial to Nikon, because i've had so many problems with Canon in the past. I own a d40 and it it is a great camera for the money. I'm buying a D300 this week though!!!

gyv0fMQZaa	It sounds like you're very caring about other people's feelings and you'd rather have harmony than conflict. Your problem is very reasonable and hopefully here are a few things that will help you out.<br>  <br>  SOLUTIONS:<br>  1. Make up a couple little white lies..."I'm sick so I'd rather not share my germs.", "I just downloaded some new sounds that I wanted to check out.", etc.<br>  <br>  2.  Plainly say "Sorry, I want to use it from now on."<br>  <br>  3. Buy a $10 alternative Mp3 player and offer it to beggars as a joke but also as a serious push-off.<br>  <br>  4. It might take a couple hours, but delete all of your music and just put little children songs on it.<br>  <br>  5. Say "No, Sorry."<br>  <br>  Just remember that it's your gift. You shouldn't have to not be able to enjoy your things. You're basically being a push-over and sometimes we have to be a little passive to get the point across. Your intentions are good, but unless you're risking getting bullied, don't give in to other temptations.|`|oq1jnmupaa	unless its an attractive girl, tell them to **** off. if theyre your close friends then they will understand. if you hardley know them, then they shouldnt be using it anyway. if its a girl u like, let her use it. but honestly, you can just be like, hell no, its mine and if u like it so much, get a job and buy one. you should listen to your music when you want to|`|507yKDS3aa	yeah i have the same problem! it is so annoying! just keep letting them use it and eventually they will realize that most of the apps on it are pointless and theyll stop asking you it worked for me at least. i actually started making money off letting peopel hold it. i got a dollar whenever anyone held it. it was awesome. lolz|`|1CFF1aYIaa	its because its the best ipod around.  i recently got one myself, and i havent brought it to school, i wouldnt dare.  just dont bring it to school, or wherever you go on ur bus.  or just say "no, get the eff away from me you friggin idiot" most of those kids probably arent even your friends. most of my friends have the touch's now too, and we only let people see them who are our good friends.|`|3z6lwCHuaa	They probably want to use it because it's a ipod touch and those are really cool, and there fun to play on. You can stop then by if they say if they can use it, so ''No, sorry" I'm listening to it. and just keep telling them no, eventually they'll stop asking.|`|wYDdcv0Baa	"NO" will probably be the best saying but it *can* result in a being victim of bullying... They want to try your iPod because it is a electronic. If you see some electronic that looks good, then you'll want to try it. And even if someone has iPod, that person will want to know what things are in your iPod.|`|BtIAB7duaa	u could just say no. if theyre your friends they will still talk to you. they just dont know how you feel because you are not telling them. leaving it in your pocket will only allow it to collect dust and then sooner or later you will get so mad and go over the top in anger. when really all you had to do was say the word.|`|MCczXQW3aa	If your busmates are your frineds they shoudl listen to what you have to say. If you tell them that u dont like ppl useing it or that you dont like sharing. Or just say no. you dont have to be rude just say like no sry i dont like people using my things.  <br>  hope this helps<br>  good luck|`|wDKq567gaa	Well what I would do is tell them that on of yall scratched it and that you dont trust anyone to use it anymore, this way your friends wont be mad for saying NO to them and they wont think of you as being an *** and will think that your somewhat reasonable. =D|`|aq0wOb6Waa	that always happens to me to so i just tell them that its about to die and that if you do anything on it besides listen to music it will die|`|I7jXyZoIaa	just be like nahh im listening to it right now, in a nice way. theyll get bored if it eventually. im gonna guess your in middle school, thats how kids always were bc i always had a nice phone|`|cb4RQXQfaa	tell them to get there own if they want to use it and they probably want it because they are soooooooooo jealous of you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|lIiUOwMNaa	dont let dem use it u dizzy blond|`|wcyYtKdZaa	BECAUSE YOU TOUCH YOURSELF AT NIGHT!!!!|`|Q7st7Uasaa	Bunch a cheap bastards, why don't you send them to Wal-Mart for the day.|`|l1jQohGqaa	tell them to **** off|`|HypqcnJaaa	"Forget" it at home one day. Or just say that you wanna listen to it. =D|`|ZpR57jbBaa	say no boy i'm listening to my jayum right now|`|3Rqq6WjDaa	Well it probably because they want to have something to do when there on the bus and since you have let them use it they are taking atvantage of you and using it whenever they want, just tell them politly no, or dont sit by them, but its yours and you are in control of it.|`|YSRXarooaa	I am not reading all of that. But don't be a pushover. Just say "leave me the f*ck alone and get your own ipod." Or else you will get it stolen by a stranger.|`|a1UkVGpHaa	Just say it's about to die or you wanna listen to it later and it doesn't have enough battery or like joke around and say get ur own.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Just tell them "no".<br>  It's not that hard. :P|`|IGAx1FgEaa	TELL THEM TO **** OFF!!!!!<br>  <br>  they probably want 2 use it cuz they don't have 1... DUH!<br>  u don't have 2 give it to them if you don't want 2.... that's why i don't take out my psp sometimes cuz they're some ppl that just keep naggin u and naggin u about seeing ur stuff... its annoying as hell, isn't it?!?!<br>  <br>  like i said, tell them 2 **** off or go 2 hell and leave ur cool ipod touch alone....|`|vMiX1lL7aa	my friends do that too and i just let them.. but they usually want to borrow it during class time so they can watch videos in maths usually. <br>  but you should just say no.<br>  dont worry its not that hard, i do it all the time :)|`|smFjFknKaa	because ipod touches rock,and maybe they like the music you listen to.but easiest thing to do is say Noo.|`|2is9mbLSaa	You don't get time to use it?<br>  Do you ride the bus all day??|`|7WcfzvPvaa	Just say no, or fill it with a bunch of songs no one likes!|`|KkjOXRRWaa	Just say NO.|`|AA12262567	I understand what you're coming from. I used to be jealous of other kids in high school who had iPods but I just got mine for my birthday in December. People think it's cool, as it will continue to be cool. I used to always want to play and touch them too but I never got a chance to really use one till I got my own. <br>  <br>  You should stand your ground and just refuse to let them use it, especially kids who have seen it before. They need to understand it's your's, not theirs, and it's your's to use. I understand if another kid is curious and somehow has never used one (which is rare now) to let them see, but unless that happens, just tell them no. You don't have to settle for not being able to listen to your music because you know they will ask to use it. <br>  <br>  Next time you're on the bus take it out as usual and if come to see others wanting to play with it, simply state no. If that doesn't get through their skulls, report them to your bus driver as they are constantly bothering you (harassment I suppose). I hope this helps you! Remember, say no!|`|uQZQTAAlaa	I have the same problem except I have a nano but even still we still have the exact issue having to do with our busmates. Anyway, just say no. Tell them "I really don't want you to use it anymore. If you want to use it buy your own." Or some along those lines. I know I deal with it too. Well I have the advantage of saying "I don't want germs from people's ears on my earphones." But since you have the ipod touch just be a man and tell them no. It's not that hard and if they resent you because you won't let them use your ipod touch then they're being really immature and ignore them.

hLkpuG9Xaa	Your description of your desires and needs point directly to getting a DSLR. A digital single lens reflex camera allows you to swap lenses, and has a much bigger sensor that captures greater detail than regular compact cameras. A DSLR will let you change all the settings you wish, but some cameras will do more than others.<br>  <br>  The main contenders (IMO) for getting a beginners camera are Canon, Nikon and Sony.<br>  <br>  Regardless whether you'll get one from any of these, the best choice would be to get a kit that contains two lenses, one being something like 18-55 (landscape-portrait) and 55-200(sports-action-wildlife). Many kits come with these, and you get a discount because of it. I would suggest saving up for a macro lens later, as these two will be good enough for now. <br>  <br>  The three cameras that are competitive in this beginner class are : Nikon D40, Canon XTi and Sony A300.<br>  <br>  Nikon D40: Light, compact, and user friendly. Many users say that nikons have the best ergonomics, but thats for you to find out. It has 6 megapixels, which is enough unless you're planning on printing higher than 8.5x11.<br>  <br>  Canon XTi: 10 megapixels, fairly light too. No live view. 3fps.<br>  <br>  Sony A300: 10 MP, bit heavy though. In body image stabilization. Live view, 3 fps.<br>  *Note, if you can live without live view, you can get the sony a200 which is exactly the same for about 50-100 bucks cheaper.*<br>  <br>  If you get any of these with an 18-55 and 55-200 kit lens. (Oh and by the way, the a300 comes with an 18-70 standard, therefore wider range.) the price should not be more than 800 dollars. You should have extra money left over for things like memory, cases or filters.<br>  <br>  There is a great trick you can do if you have both of these lenses for some EXTREME macro photography. Here is a link to a video tutorial. <a href="http://www.prophotolife.com/2008/07/31/quick-video-4-extreme-macro-photography-trick/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prophotolife.com/2008/07/31/q...</a><br>  <br>  Some things i would recommend before buying any camera would be to FEEL them in your hand. Go to a local electronic store and test them out. Go through the menus, feel the weight, the grip. This should be one of the major deciding factors. Because, who cares if you have an amazing camera if you don't like the way it feels in your hand. It has to match you.<br>  <br>  I have some links for deeper comparisons, done by other critics on these cameras.<br>  <br>  I wish you good luck, and i also recommend checking out the Canon Xs as well as a Nikon D60! or even D80. :)|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	go get those disposable kodaks they have at walmart, they give you quality films at an affordable price|`|sG6ZlGGRaa	canon rebel xs, or xsi<br>  nikon d40 or d60|`|AA10722993	Stick with Canon or Nikon.  You will have the biggest selection of lenses to choose from.   Then go to a good camera store where you can get a knowledgeable salesperson to help you look at some cameras in your price range.  Handle the cameras and see how easy it is to work the controls and use the menu.   Take some pictures and ask lots of questions.  Tell the salesperson what kind of pictures you want to take.   If you do this, you will find the perfect camera for YOU when you hold it in your hands.   <br>  <br>  You see, the perfect camera for me, might not be the perfect one for you.   I have the Canon Rebel XTi and it is a great camera for me!|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	for your purposes, there would not be enough difference between cameras in that price range to amount to a hill of beans.  From what I have seen, I like the Sony and the Olympus models, the lenses are a higher quality, even at the kit lens level.|`|c0e153120e16cf5881dd153a30d4ac3baa	You are talking about an SLR camera (as oppose to the compact camera) that would allow you to adjust your exposure and be able to change the Lens.<br>  <br>  I use Nikon D70s for more than 2 years now.  The learning process was slow because I was studying, but now after graduation, I find it easier to set the camera on manual mode and shoot.  There are newer versions of Nikon that are now available at the market but expensive (D700 is WOW!).<br>  <br>  Photography is an expensive hobby (editing software, lenses, filters, flashes, tripod...etc). Do a research before buying anything.  Join sites like flickr or photosig so you can find people who would offer you more help and tips on this matter.|`|i5OVORXgaa	The Nikon D40 and Canon Rebel XT are good starting cameras... save the rest of your money for lenses and other accessories that you might need.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	Recommend Nikon D60. <br>  This is as good as it gets folks! I got the 18-55 kit a week ago and have already ordered the 55-200 lens and the speedlight. I'm positive there are better cameras out there, but for the price, it's hard to see how this can be beat. I'm eagerly learning the manual modes to really be able to use all the creative freedom that this camera offers. I have only scratced the surface, but I'm blown away by how good the pic's look and how easy the camera makes taking "perfect" (to me anyway) shots. <br>  It's solid but not bulky, the menus are just plain easy to understand (with a help system), and the buttons seem to have ended up just about where your fingers expect them to be. <br>  If you are moving from a point-and-shoot to something more advanced, this is the one. <br>  <br>  Nikon D60 Digital SLR Camera with Accessory Kit<br>  KIT INCLUDES 9 PRODUCTS -- All Brand New Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties: <br>  <#1> Nikon D60 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm VR Zoom Lens<br>  <#2> Nikon AF-S 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens<br>  <#3> Transcend 8GB HC SecureDigital Class 6 (SDHC) Card<br>  <#4> Spare EN-EL9 Li-Ion Battery Pack<br>  <#5> Nikon SLR System Case<br>  <#6> USB 2.0 High Speed SecureDigital (SD) Card Reader<br>  <#7> Digital Image Recovery Software<br>  <#8> Memory Card Storage Wallet<br>  <#9> Microfiber Cleaning Cloth<br>  <br>  $749.95 + $18.95 shipping<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D60-Digital-55-200mm-Accessory/dp/B00154OS7Q/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236491174&sr=1-4&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D60-Digital-...</a><br>  <br>  Highly recommend,that you need.|`|qR4xcTfaaa	The D40x and D60 from Nikon are okay BUT:<br>  You should seriously look in to buying a new D80, it is much more solid than both D60 & D40, it is a PRO level camera and the price just dropped by 33%.<br>  With the D80 you can use *ALL* NIKON NIKKOR Auto Focus lenses, but with the D40x & D60 you can only use DX lenses. This will prevent you from upgrading in the future to a FX full frame cameras.<br>  <br>  Therefor you should definitely go with the D80 it is very user friendly you will be very happy with it as I am, I guaranty it. <br>  You can buy it on Ebay new with many accessories for less than $500.<br>  <br>  I recommend for you to start with a mid level lens, the lenses that come with the camera are low end;<br>  You must always remember - The LENS is the most important part of the picture, therefor you should invest in mid to high end lenses.<br>  Starting with 24-85mm F2.8/4.0 is a very good serious amateur lens for wide angle(or 24-120mm) this lens is great for Landscape, portrait and micro pictures. Also the 16-85mm. As for Tele Zoom I recommend the 80-200mm F2.8 ED even if you get it used from a good owner (new is almost $1000 or you can get the TOKINA model or TEMRON etc) this lens is great for wild life photography. with these 2 lenses you can not go wrong, the first lens also have a 1:2 Micro capability and since the D40 is a DX camera it will be 1:1.5, this will allow you to get very Very close to a flower or butterfly etc.<br>  The range will be 35-117mm and 117-290mm since they are FX lenses (which also gives you the opportunity in the future to upgrade to an FX camera and then 24mm will be 24mm etc) the GLASS in these lenses are the best of NIKON NIKKOR.

aaMo4KIsaa	Yes, but A TV antenna is a TV antenna, there is no difference between an HDTV/digital TV antenna and a conventional analog antenna. Don't waste your money on so called high-tech HDTV. Manufacturers and Retailers are taking advantage of the current, heightened Consumer interest in all things related to Digital-HDTV. However, a TV-Antenna does not discriminate between Analog TV and Digital / HDTV Signals, and the one you have shoud be just fine..<br>  <br>  Regards <br>  JS|`|aSTmFCiBaa	yes|`|w4I9oj2Maa	Yes, all TV sets need an antenna, but you can use your older antenna setup with no problems.|`|56731f6628f8c20e23546897ddcf525daa	yes

RyvKws7Laa	In terms of overall picture quality, Plasma trumps LCD.  LCD fanboys will tell you otherwise, but industry professionals will show you a multitude of consumer tests that prove otherwise.  Sorry to the LCD lovers, but its not the greatest technology known to mankind.<br>  <br>  Plasma will provide stronger color, blacks, and contrast.  It also handles fast motion better as it has near instantaneous refresh times (much like old CRT tube televisions).  Plasma is a bit softer in SD (think major motion films).  This isn't a good vs bad issue though, its personal taste more than anything else.  Also, the Plasma colors tend to have a bit more 'pop' to them.  Again this is purely a matter of taste.<br>  <br>  Plasmas myths - (1) they experience burn-in, (2) they don't work at high altitudes, and (3) they have short life spans.  The burn in issue is really no longer an issue.  Just condition the TV.  For the first 100-200 hours keep the contrast (picture) and brightness settings cranked way down.  Then go ahead an optimize.  For the high altitudes, its no longer an issue, you can own a Plasma in Denver, so you'll be fine.  As for the short life spans, the better Plasma models out there are good for 100,000 hours, which means if you ran it for 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, it would last for 34 years.  I think that's a respectable life for a TV.<br>  <br>  Plasma's though are made of glass.  So they are a glossy finish.  If you have to put the TV in a room with too much uncontrollable ambient light (you can't turn off lights, you can't close blinds) then glare might become an issue.<br>  <br>  LCD's are the everyman HDTV.  They are cost effective.  They are thinner and lighter than Plasmas (though the new Panasonic Plasmas are going to change that).  On the whole they will tend to draw less electricity than Plasmas, but the better Plasmas can give the LCDs a run for their money.<br>  <br>  LCDs have issues with fast motion.  They experience a motion blur.  This is a ghost trail behind the fast moving object.  Better LCDs try to counter act this with 120Hz or 240Hz refresh rates.  These still don't match Plasma (and CRT and DLP).  But they help move it in the right direction.  But you pay a price premium for those speedy refresh rates.<br>  <br>  LCDs are sharper in SD (think the evening news).  This isn't a good vs bad, its just personal taste.  LCDs have a bit more muted colors.  Again this isn't good vs bad, its personal taste.  LCDs are though a matte finish, so a stronger option for you if you're in a room where glare issues are a big concern.<br>  <br>  If you go Plasma stick with Panasonic Viera or Samsung.  You'll get the best bang for the buck from them.  The Panasonic Viera 50PZ80 or 50PZ800 are both solid options.  The Samsung PN50A550 or PN50A650 are both solid choices.<br>  <br>  If you go LCD, I would really try and stay with Samsung at that size.  You could look at the Sony XBR lineup too, but I think you'll get far more picture quality bang for buck with the Samsungs.  Specifically look at the Samsung LN50A550 or LN50A650 models.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	The #1 TV of all time: The Pioneer PRO-111FD.  It's a 50" plasma, but Pioneer recently announced they won't be in the plasma business for much longer, so they may be in high demand.  If you buy this TV and get it professionally calibrated (by an ISF technician, not Best Buy) you can't have a better TV for sports, movies, TV, etc.  The colors are perfect and the blacks are as deep as can be.<br>  <br>  Here's Cnet's "Best HDTVs" list:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/best-high-definition-tvs/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/best-high-defini...</a><br>  <br>  Most of them are plasma and almost all of them are over 50".  I am a cheapskate, so I went with the least expensive TV that received an "Excellent" rating, the Samsung PN50A550.  However, you may want to stick with LCD.  They're lower maintenance.<br>  <br>  If you want the best LCD for the price, I recommend the Samsung LN46A950 or the LN55A950.  The reason I think these are the best is because they are LED-backlit, meaning it alleviates the main criticism of LCD TVs--the issues rendering deep blacks.  The 46" is about $2,500 on Amazon and the 55" is closer to $4,000.  Expensive yes, but you asked for the best.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/compare.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=lcdtv&prda=LN55A950D1FXZA&prdb=LN46A950D1FXZA" rel="nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subty...</a><br>  <br>  Finding an ISF technician: <a href="http://www.imagingscience.com/isf-trained.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.imagingscience.com/isf-traine...</a>|`|8vfCRg7Caa	Samsung and Sony.

If he's a videophile, tell him your mother wants a new tv and ask him which is better.

FyPoeq7xaa	Here is the answer to a similar question that I asked:<br>  by esmelcio<br>   <br>  The way I see it, you won't be able to fix it without opening it. I think there may be three possible causes:<br>  <br>  1. your USB ports have a problem or the cable is broken<br>  * very unlikely if you ask me..<br>  - solution: try it on another computer, but if the problem is on the cable, I believe that you'll simply have to buy a new one<br>  <br>  2. the player got hit by something and the battery got disconnected from the circuit board<br>  * not likely since these batteries are usually connected with flexible wires and solder<br>  - solution: you should carefully open the player and check for any loose wires near the battery<br>  <br>  3. the battery is too empty for the charging circuit to recognize it<br>  * very likely, sometimes happens with nokia phones - a phone left disconnected for a long time will have its battery drop to almost 0V and somehow the phone won't know how to charge it<br>  - solution: disconnect the battery and check if it is empty with a multimeter, if so, give it a little help by directly connecting a transformer to it for 5 minutes - give it about 0.5 to 2V above rated battery voltage - for example if the battery is 2.4V give it 3V - don't forget to observe polarity<br>  <br>  4. the battery is old and has reached it's maximum charge/discharge cycle number<br>  * likely, but still unlikely for a battery that is 1 year old - most batteries last for anywhere from 300 to 800 cycles - this would mean charging your player everyday!<br>  - solution: you should try the same solution for point 3, you need to check that battery is really dead and won't accept any charge before going out and getting a new one<br>  <br>  NOTES:<br>  * before attempting anything, if the player is less than 1 year old send it in for a refund or a new player<br>  * if in the middle of the above steps you find out that the battery is fine, I believe that you'll have to assume the charging circuit of your player is somehow fried..<br>  * if you're not comfortable with electricity, electronics, wires and soldering you probably shouldn't mess with your player since you can: break it, fry it or both.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

One month you could use 300 minutes the next month 600, it doesn't matter just at long you pay those minutes at the end of the month. This is easier because you are not bound by a contract in which you have to use the service on average for 2 years and you have to select a plan. If you go over your minutes you would have to pay overage charges. You have to use those minutes within the month or you lose them.

RyvKws7Laa	The Sony is likely going to give you better picture quality.  There are some specific LG models (for certain sizes) that tend to deliver good picture quality, but overall Sony will be the safer bet.<br>  <br>  But the LG Jazz does seem to rate reasonably well.  It is one of the better options from LG for sure.  I would at least go and take a look at once in store to see if the image quality is satisfactory for you.  Make sure to have the store feed it both Standard Definition and High Definition.  It might not perform up to snuff on one or the other (be a little less demanding with SD though, its just not going to look as good on an LCD than it did on your old tube CRT, that's just the nature of the technology).<br>  <br>  I think considering your budget you're going to have to go with the LG Jazz.  I think they make a 32" that would fall within that budget.  I think the Sony X Series are much larger TVs for starters and would be at least 2x if not more like 3x your budget.  <br>  <br>  You could also consider the Sony W series.  They have a 32" that may fall within your budget.  I don't know if I would call it better than an LG Jazz or not.

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	It doesn't work that way, you have to connect optical cables from your devices to receiver for audio.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	"but it will leave the TV (regardless of the cable) as 2-channel audio."<br>  <br>  I dont think this is correct.<br>  <br>  The optical output from a TV is designed to feed 5.1 to a external receiver.<br>  <br>  If you are watching standard def - the optical feed is 2 channel. But all HDTV shows use Dolby Digital 5.1 as the sound standard.  So the optical output must be 5.1<br>  <br>  So to the original poster: run HDMI to the TV, use the TV speakers for casual TV watching.<br>  <br>  But running the optical to a Dolby Digital receiver gives you the option of firing up the 5.1 surround sound system for more serious TV/movie watching.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I am unaware of any TV that will pass multi-channel audio.  It might go in at 5.1 or 7.1, but it will leave the TV (regardless of the cable) as 2-channel audio.  That's why you must run any audio that you want to hear in surround through the receiver.  You are limited with your connection options.  Is digital coax an option on the DVD player or cable box?

The only two lenses that I use at gigs cost me more than $3000 and $2000 respectively. The camera was $5500. <br>  <br>  To shoot at gigs (and get good results) you need a very fast lens, something that will perform well in low light as flash and strobes are generally frowned on, even if you are shooting at the band's request. I'll get there early, when they are setting up the lighting and meter all the stage positions, set WB etc. <br>  <br>  For a low cost alternative you need to look at one of the P&S cameras that have a F2.8 or better zoom. Most of them are pretty noisy in low light so you aren't going to be blowing anything up to poster size.  Even those cameras are well above e150. Maybe you might want to think about eBay and a second-hand P&S.

It does have an Ipod which is perfect because now you no longer have to walk around with both a cell-phone and an Ipod. It has maps. If you own a mac computer like i do. It is perfect, because it syncs your calendars and Contacs. It even syncs safari's bookmarks to your phones safari. With 3g it has blazing speeds. Im 15 and i love this phone.

AA10775666	Your unlimited plan does not cover international texting - you'd be charged around 10 to 25 cents per each text you send or receive.|`|o6BDapZjaa	No; most carriers charge a fee to connect to another country's phone system, which is what you're doing if you connect to a phone that "lives" in another country.  <br>  <br>  If the phone is a U.S. phone that is "visiting" another country (for instance, your friend from the U.S. is visiting Canada), then you can text to that phone just as you always would because your U.S. company is talking to another U.S. company; how THAT company gets your message to the recipient is between them and the recipient, and doesn't involve you.|`|FfOAeWsNaa	no because you would need the international pllan|`|grRGlNWhaa	i dont think so.
o6BDapZjaa	You need to get your phone set up for MMS (picture messaging) on AT&T's system.  I'm presuming this is an unlocked phone that came from a company other than AT&T, even though the sim is from AT&T; that means it won't have AT&T settings (or any other settings) installed at the factory.  You'll need to give it some information like the servers it will use, gateway address, ports, etc.  Call AT&T from ANOTHER phone and get them to help you set up the phone to work with their system.  They may walk you through the process, or they may be able to send settings directly to your phone through a text message, but it can definitely be done; I know, because I do it all the time for T-Mobile customers with unlocked phones.

qR4xcTfaaa	Yes, Absolutely, the D lenses are better because they let you use the full capacity of Nikon 3D Matrix programing and they have the same level glass and better than the E lenses.<br>  <br>  I recommend for you to start with a mid level lens, the lenses that come with the camera are very low end, as you discovered; <br>  You must always remember - The LENS is the most important part of the picture, therefor you should invest in mid to high end lenses.<br>  Starting with 24-85mm F2.8/4.0 is a very good serious amateur lens for wide angle(or 24-120mm) this lens is great for Landscape, portrait and micro pictures. Also the 16-85mm. As for Tele Zoom I recommend the 80-200mm F2.8 ED even if you get it used from a good owner (new is almost $1000 or you can get the TOKINA model or TEMRON etc) this lens is great for wild life photography. with these 2 lenses you can not go wrong, the first lens also have a 1:2 Micro capability and since the D60 is a DX camera it will be 1:1.5, this will allow you to get very Very close to a flower or butterfly etc.<br>  The range will be 35-117mm and 117-290mm since they are FX lenses (which also gives you the opportunity in the future to upgrade to an FX camera and then 24mm will be 24mm etc) the GLASS in these lenses are the best of NIKON NIKKOR.

Fto3FH8Zaa	ok, in Halo 3, for games smaller than 6 people you simply speak into the mic, while larger, you have to press up on the d-pad, and that first sound means go ahead and speak, but if you don't say anything, there's a second sound meaning the channel has closed, it works that way becuase it saves bandwidth to keep games from lagging. and if your in a party, and have party speak on, only your party can hear you, but if not, in game, with party speak off, only your teamates can hear you, with the exception of proximity voice, which means if you are next to an online player that is part of the other team, you can hear that player as well.

This is to keep people from just leaving their mic on while they eat or yell at someone in their house.|`|wIM3vNtwaa	Pushing Up on Halo 3 tells the game you want to talk so it patches you through so everyone can hear you, as soon as you release it no one will hear you.<br>  <br>  In most games you do not have to push anything before you talk.

kDV56xIXaa	Wii Fit is not a good way to lose weight. Most of the mini games involve balance or stretching. There are a couple games that are considered "aerobics." Three of those games are "jogging" games. If you actually jog in place, your mii goes too fast in the game and you trip and fall. It is more like stepping in place. The other mini games are not very effective either. Wii Fit merely tracks your weight, but it barely helps you lose any.<br>  <br>  Mario Kart is a bad weight-losing game too. It is more like a regular video game, except the controller is the wii remote/steering wheel.<br>  <br>  If you are just looking to lose weight, then going on jogs and exercising daily is a better option. If you really feel you need to lose weight by playing a game, Active Life Outdoor Challenge for Wii is a better choice. Wii Fit focuses on just shifting your weight around on the balance board. Outdoor Challenge uses a mat where you jump around to play (like dance dance revolution), though it might be more of a kids game.<br>  <br>  I don't think eating a lot less or none at all will help either. It is unhealty for your body, and if you start eating again, you will gain the weight back very fast.|`|s9d8I0Uaaa	I dont agree with either of them. mario kart wii was fun for 3 days then it gets boring. wii fit doesnt work. its just easy stuff. if you want to lose weight, go on a diet, or workout. im not saying this to be mean.

RMmh0aimaa	TV's have a phosphorous coating on the back of the screen area which lights up when electrons hit is propelled from the element of the tube (the guns). This may very well be poisonous if you inhale it.<br>  <br>  However smashing TV's is unlikely to cause any toxic exposure as the stuff literally sticks to the back of the screen and does not float around inside the tube, therefore it shouldn't become airborne.<br>  <br>  If you blow up fluorescent tubes (lights) however you could be exposed to mercury poisoning, something which many people are unaware of. Mercury poisoning can lead to birth defects in newborn babies (as seen in some Chinese hospitals where mercury has contaminated underground water supplies) and other health complications. Fluorescent tubes should be disposed of correctly by an authorized company.|`|A1iDPPOeaa	The picture tube (CRT) has a vacuum inside, so it didn't explode, it imploded.  There are lead and other metals used in the manufacture of them, but nothing that would likely cause harm to you or your buddies in this instance.|`|akvrwpywaa	You shouldn't do that.  While it may be fun, CRT's are excellent TV's that are quickly becoming extinct.  It's like entering an old classic automobile into a demolition derby and sending it to the junkyard.<br>  But to answer your question, tube TV's use a Cathode Ray Tube to shoot electrons onto the phosphor-coated screen to create an image.  This CRT has a vacuum inside it, since any air molecules could bend the beams of electrons so they wouldn't travel in completely straight lines.  When air leaks in through a break, air will rush in, and the device implodes (opposite of explodes, in the sense that the pressure is much lower inside and quickly equalizes).  This often makes quite a loud noise and sends the rest of the glass flying inwards, just to be bounced back out.<br>  CRT televisions contain a number of heavy metals, mostly lead in the glass (so that you're not bombarded with the electrons being shot at the screen).  The inside of the screen is also coated with phosphors similar to those on the inside of a fluorescent light bulb; it's a whiteish powder.  As far as any gases or liquids or anything, there shouldn't be any (unless the implosion stirred up phosphor dust into the air which you may or may not have inhaled, but probably didn't if you were that far away).

Now if you're using Component cables (blue,green,red,   and red and white) use the red and white audio cables if you're using composite(yellow,red,white) again use the red and white audio cables. <br>  There shouldn't be a need for optical, unless thats what you've already been using for your ps3 audio and video to your tv

hzZpb931aa	Your a photographer without a camera? that a new one. Canon's are far from been the best camera.<br>  Read this (scroll down to Failures you'll see the Canons had the most.)<br>  <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/antarctica-2009-worked.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays...</a>|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Canon is one of the two makers of professional level DSLR's. The other being Nikon. Pentax, Sony and Olympus also make very nice cameras but they do not really make pro level cameras and lenses. You can't go wrong with a Canon. Obviously some models are better than others but all of them are great cameras. If this will be your first SLR's either the Rebel XS or XSi would be a good choice. Don't let people tell you that your pictures would be so much better if you bought the 50D or an even higher model. They wouldn't be. Aside from your skill the biggest determiner of image quality is the lens you use. Buying a high end camera and a cheap lens is not worth it. Better to buy the cheaper camera and high end lenses. Build your lens collection and learn how to use the camera properly. Remember it is not a point and shoot and really shouldn't be used as such. After you have spent a couple of years learning you can upgrade to a higher level camera.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Cannon makes a premium line of camera, and has by far some of the best lenses on the market.  The EOS is a high quality camera that will not disappoint you.  It is not the best cannon on the market (I can show you some pro cameras in the $15000 range) but for a "prosumer" camera it will more than meet your expectations.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I purchased the Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Standard Zoom Lens just over a month ago. It is by far the best camera I've ever had. The quality of the pictures is fantastic and the one lens does all is even better. <br>  <br>  I've had the Digital Rebel with multiple lenses which I loved but this is much better. Prior to that I had a Canon sure shot digital prior to that and a Minolta Maxxum 7000 film camera with multiple lenses before going digital. The 50D is a more professional camera with multiple functions and ease of use. I am still learning all its features. I bought an Aputure remote to go with it and I all ready had a Canon 430EX flash which works great as well. <br>  <br>  This is a great camera! <br>  <br>  I found best deal at Amazon.<br>  Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens<br>  List Price: $2,600.00  <br>  Price: $1,419.00 & free shipping  <br>  You Save: $1,181.00 (45%) <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50D-Digital-28-135mm-Standard/dp/B001EQ4BY0/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236488611&sr=1-5&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50D-Digital-...</a>

Voyager is nice. but after a while of having it the touch screen kinda starts bugging so whatever u want. Try getting a blackberry im getting the blackberry curve|`|qhMHGk8Uaa	The difference is the front screen the env2 is really small but it has regular numbers.  The voyager has a touch screen but overall it is kinda bulky.  So which ever you like more.

2f9dd364fde210fed1fb348be36d43ccaa	no u cant. the unlimited texting plan only applies to the texts u send inside the country. u get charged if u text abroad.|`|We5Ugh2eaa	yep that is right, you will be charged texting for international text.  they are 20 cents per message incoming and out going.
xGzq2Eueaa	you probably be able to buy a couple of games And a 12 month xbox live.|`|q6uyloYdaa	I'm not sure if you are selling this on craigslist or something or to Gamestop. But if you are selling it to gamestop all of that stuff should be plenty to get a 360. The Wii system itself is $200 in store credit and they always have trade-in deals going on, so yeah. If you're selling it on Craigslist, obviously you set your own price.
dZJZE4Wqaa	well if you trade with gamestop you get 180 dollars all those games you would probaly get 150 plus 40% the downloaded games and internet dont count cuz they delete it right away and you get 7 bucks for the gamecube controller and about 25 for the wii ones.so you will have enough to get a 360 and a game or 2 or maybe 4.|`|HiU8pyfjaa	400 at least enough for an xbox 360|`|4WK6cWxmaa	um probably about 400 but depends|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Honestly speaking if you already have so much with it I would just keep it and save for an Xbox instead. Otherwise its really just a much larger waste of money since you will never get the real worth of what you already have.

Check your AV cables and make sure your game disk is not damaged.<br>  <br>  Also if it is Error 68, it means your harddrive is dead.  replace it.|`|LnYr2dLfaa	Call: 1-800-4-MY-XBOX<br>  <br>  That's the Xbox support hotline. You can ask them to send you a box to send your 360 (with the Red Ring of Death) to MS to get it repaired for free.
j1FKHcPIaa	whatever it is its over priced
UmX58lC0aa	Lol|`|XCv8gQhDaa	i have encountered this many times while playing the problem is your disk tray while the xbox 360 is siting vertical the rotation of your CD creates centrifugal  force causing the CD to kinda tilt off to one side of the disk drive this causes the CD version of the ring of death the common fix for this is to set it up horizontal if that doesn't work send it in for a newer model of the Xbox 360 also don't get a used one because microsoft put a smaller heat-sink in the older Xbox 360s to accommodate the larger video card this causes system failure. Just my 2 cents i hope it helps you

AA10560304	A podcast is like a radio program except people can download a podcast to a portable media player (such as an iPod or other mp3 player) and listen to it at their convenience. Podcasts can be created by anyone with the right equipment (computer, internet connection, and audio recorder) and uploaded to a server on the internet where they can be found and downloaded by podcatchers (programs that can identify a podcast.) The podcatcher reads an rss feed to identify the podcast and download it to a computer.<br>  <br>  Podcasts can have only sound or sound and video. A video podcast is sometimes called a vidcast. A podcast with sound and pictures (but not moving) is called an enhanced podcast.<br>  <br>  Like the term broadcast, podcast can refer either to the content itself or to the method by which the content is syndicated; the latter is also called podcasting. A podcaster is the person who creates the content.<br>  <br>  A podcast is a special type of rss feed. It is a series of visual or sound and visual data files which are distributed over the internet by syndicated download, through Web feeds, to portable media players and personal computers. Though the same content may also be made available by direct download or streaming, a podcast is distinguished from most other digital media formats by its ability to be syndicated, subscribed to, and downloaded automatically when new content is added.<br>  <br>  The term is a portmanteau of the words "iPod" and "broadcast",the Apple iPod being the brand of portable media player for which the first podcasting scripts were developed (see history of podcasting). Such scripts allow podcasts to be automatically transferred from a personal computer to a mobile device after they are downloaded.<br>  <br>  As more devices other than iPods became able to synchronize with podcast feeds, a backronym developed where podcast stood for "Personal On Demand broadCAST.Though such a definition would create a misnomer, because podcasts are not available "on demand"; they are subscribed to and usually received at set intervals. Such a definition would more accurately describe a direct download or streaming media.

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	If I had the choice between a Pentax and a Canon of the same vintage, I would select the Pentax - especially if the light meter is more accurate.  Repairing the light meter can involve quite a bit of cash, at least $150, probably more.  <br>  <br>  I have had Pentax and Canons of that vintage, A1s and AE1s and I personally find that the Canon is far more difficult to use than the Pentax.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Are you using the same type of lens?  Just because it says something different does it have to be wrong?  How do the pictures come out?  Expose a roll of film in both and write down the settings and see if they work as they say.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Your Canon is an old camera and as such has probably had the battery that controls the light meter changed. I would first check that the battery is the appropriate one for your camera. The voltage of the battery will effect the light meter. If it is the wrong battery the light meter will be off. The good news is that it will be off by a certain consistent amount. You can compare it to your Pentax and see how much it is off. I included a link from Canon that says that the battery is (One 4G-13 6 V mercury oxide battery or 4LR44 alkaline battery). I have also included a link for the correct batteries. Replace the batteries and see what happens. If the meter is still not correct then it will have to be repaired. <br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camera/film/data/1976-1985/1976_ae1.html?lang=us&categ=srs&page=a&p=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.canon.com/camera-museum/camer...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.bothfull.com/fdsf.html?OVRAW=lr44%20batteries&OVKEY=lr44%20battery&OVMTC=standard&OVADID=4125126011&OVKWID=10564963511" rel="nofollow">http://store.bothfull.com/fdsf.html?OVRA...</a>

deqc17Mkaa	As long as someone didn't just take a PS3 such as the new 80gb model, the old 40gb model or the new 160gb and slap a 60gb hard drive in it they all play PS2 games. The easy way to tell if a system has any PS2 compatibility is how many USB ports it has on the front. If there's 4 USB ports, it has at least some PS2 compatibility, if it only has 2 USB ports, it has no compatibility with PS2 games. The thing to keep in mind is if your're looking for a 60gb console you won't be finding one new and you're probably going to have to buy it off eBay or similar online sites. Conversely if you're looking for a PlayStation 3 that plays PS2 games try looking for a 20gb PlayStation 3, it has the same amount of compatibility with PS2 games as the 60gb console, above 95% but lacks wireless Internet and has a smaller hard drive (which can be changed for a much larger hard drive by yourself without voiding the warranty). If you can live without wireless Internet it's a perfect option as the 20gb console can be found much cheaper as it isn't nearly as desired.|`|fLF2VM8uaa	Yeah, don't go by the number of GB of the system. People can swap out the hard drive and make any PS3 into one with a 60GB hard drive. Go by the number of USB ports. Any PS3 with 4 USB ports is backward compatable. <br>  <br>  BTW, there is no such thing as a yellow light of death. I have never heard this term before, and I troll the internet for PS3 information frequently.|`|B5DLEEPQaa	Yes they are backward compatible. btw, the 60gb model is no longer in production because they were likely to get the yellow light of death|`|DQ8Y2mIDaa	yes they are all the same you can play any ps1 or ps2 game on it and it has 4 usb ports not 2 it also has the big cell chips. but most of the 60gigs are bricked. they will all eventually get the ylod. that is also why the ps3s where so much at launch.<br>  <br>  dont listen to sheon hes a liar, first of all why would anyone go out and say theres no ylod, i got it last month! hes stupid and needs to get his facts straight. even people on youtube will show you its true.
ObEmnosWaa	if its under a year old and not physically damaged, call 1-800-801-1101 and explain the problem...they will send you a replacement phone for free. this is AT&T's warranty exchange number.<br>  <br>  if it is over a year old or cracked or physically damaged, then unfortunately you are out of luck...maybe you can upgrade, or check ebay for a phone to tide you over until you can upgrade. or maybe you got insurance on the phone when you purchased it? good time to use it.

3H19nUMRaa	DO NOT listen to the idiots above me who told you to blow dry your phone! that will only damage it worse. take the battery out and try not to use it for at least a week while your phone AIR dries out. trust me, you wouldnt want to fry your phone out. or you could take it to your local carrier store and see what they can do... good luck|`|kposhq84aa	well probably not because companies will not fix it for u since it's water damage.

Take the battery out and let the phone and battery air dry for at least a day.  Don't blow dry it, this can cause water to go farther into the phone and could cause heat damage problems.  After you're sure both pieces are dry, put the battery back and turn the phone on.<br>  <br>  This works 90% of the time.  Permanent water damaged is caused when the wiring system fires up, like when you turn the phone on.|`|5sTPhPGiaa	Take the battery out and place the phone in a bowl of dry white rice for a week.

Xxviy63Paa	Yes, you can, but it would be a silly thing to do. Currently there is only one type of OtherOS that works. (there is no "linux 5.0", I guess he meant YDL. Get PSUbuntu which is better: www.psubuntu.com)<br>  <br>  You can only create one 10gb "otheros" partition under XMB, so what you would do is make a dual-booting partition. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1) Reformat the HDD creating the 10gb OtherOS partition.<br>  <br>  2) download Ubuntu Gutsy or Hardy. Hardy is best if it's working good, which the site will say. Burn the .iso to a cd or dvd as required.<br>  <br>  3) Select System>Install OtherOS and follow the instructions. <br>  You will be asked whether you want to partition the hard drive automatically or manually. Automatic would make the whole thing into one Ubuntu partition, so choose manual. Check what it would do with automatic, though, and write down the size of the secondary(extended and swap) partitions. Set aside half the space for the first OS, then divide it into the primary partition, and extended and swap partitions the same size as they would have been under automatic. You'll probably be making partitions of about 4gb, 256mb and 512mb. Don't use less extended or swap, you need those to make up for ps3's limited system RAM.<br>  <br>  Then Ubuntu will install. You better have a usb hard drive or something, because the OS itself will use up almost all of that 4gb. <br>  <br>   Now, after Ubuntu installs, you will have an OS on half the OtherOS partition, and nothing on the other half. <br>  <br>  4) Go to "Install OtherOS" again, on the XMB, and this time tell the OS to install on the 5gb partition that is still empty.<br>  <br>  On pc's, Ubuntu installs a grub bootloader that allows you to choose which OS to choose when there's more than one. On ps3 the bootloader is called kboot. You may have to manually configure kboot to give you a choice, or it may simply be a matter of typing in the appropriate OS at the prompt. Read up on the specifics of kboot to see. I am certain it is possible. It's easiest to follow a trailblazer with linux.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a usb hard drive, this whole idea would be really pointless. Also, Ubuntu is great, but you might want to use one ubuntu-size distro and one small one like Puppy or Gentoo. Because 4gb is an awfully small install partition. I don't think YDL would fit on it at all.|`|4gyrvY7Jaa	Yes you can. Linux 5.0 is actually made specifically for the PS3. Just google it and do the procedure.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	yes, you can. google it and you can find all the answers you need

VJ1C5JsYaa	According to Microsoft the light turns red when:<br>  ? When there is too much current <br>  ? When the voltage is too high <br>  ? When the temperature is too high <br>  <br>  What do you normally have plugged into your xbox? Do you have an intercooler? Anything that you plug into your Xbox is taking power way from it. These things might not have been a problem for you before but now that your plugging more into it the power strain is to much and its not working.<br>  <br>  Also if I guessed right and you do have an intercooler I pray for you that it is not a nykos intercooler. If so I would advise you(and so would MS advise you) to take the intercooler off. They have been know to HELP CAUSE the RRoD. Intercoolers while they may cool down the system drastically reduce the amount of power that is going through the system. This is NOT good for the system and you will actually increase system problems by about 50%.
YiY9Yd2Jaa	It won't make any difference at all unless you have sufficient knowledge and the right lenses. Most entry level DLSR kits have lenses that are inferior to the quality of the lenses on high end P&S (Bridge) cameras that come equipped with something like a fast Leica lens. On a bright day the difference when in the hands of a skilled photographer is negligible between a good bridge camera and a DSLR with a middle of the line lens. <br>  <br>  Once you get into low light situations the DSLR is a far better option. Also for portraits the DSLR will allow you to use a lens that coupled with the much larger sensor will provide far superior depth of field control. This allows you to isolate the subject by blurring the background, a difficult thing to do with a P&S.<br>  <br>  There is no doubt that when used by a competent photographer a DSLR is a far superior camera, but if you just want to take snaps and get a reasonably good result each time - then a good P&S will probably suit you better.<br>  <br>  The down side of a DSLR is the money that you need to spend on lenses if you really are going for quality images. They are not cheap. The camera body is just the first purchase.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Karen,<br>  <br>  It all depends on what you want to do in photography.  If all you want to do is take snapshots for Myspace etc... then a point and shoot will be fine for your needs. Initially the Powershot would have more zoom features than the D40 with a 18-55 but the D40 would take better pictures in that MM range. <br>  DSLRs are pricey when compared to point and shoots, there is a compromise zone though... you can get the ADVANCED  type cameras that are way better than the standard point and shoot.  Then you can have the look without the cost.<br>  Another problem with standard point and shoots is lag time... meaning that they are known for the blurry shots.<br>  <br>  Below is a link to the Fuji camera... just for a reference of ADVANCED POINT AND SHOOT|`|pZGLhV2Waa	The biggest differences in the photo will be lower noise, more detail, better colors and a sharper image. This is for a couple of reasons. The sensor on a DSLR is up to 15 times larger than that of a point and shoot. Larger sensors have larger pixels which deliver lower noise and more detail than smaller sensors with smaller pixels. The same is true with film cameras. Larger film format will always deliver superior results. Also the optics or lenses of DSLR's are far superior than those of even the best point and shoots. Add to that better faster processors and the ability to manually choose the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO and a DSLR will always come out on top if you are willing to learn how to use it properly.|`|ZieA4fxraa	The 40D is a professional camera worth a couple of grand. The A400, by comparison is worth a couple of hundred. <br>  <br>  As for lenses, the bigger the diameter, the more light gets in, therefore a clearer photo.<br>  Also the better quality the lens, and the better the clarity, the better the photo.<br>  If you're getting into photography there's no way you should go with a cheap camera. The SLRs you can upgrade with better lenses, whereas once you have a compact you're stuck with it no matter what. <br>  Comparing an A400 with a D40 is like comparing a mini with a ferrari. Sure, the mini will get you there, but the ferrari will get you there in STYLE.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	It all depends on what you are doing with your camera and how much money you have.  If a point and shoot serves you well, don't spring for the additional cash.<br>  <br>  As for how much light can get through, Alix is telling me that a lens with a 58mm wide front glass will get more light thorough than the same lens with a 49mm wide front lens.  That is far from the truth.  The rear glass width would tell you more, that is where the f stops are concerned.  <br>  <br>  There is not a substantial difference between the 40D and the A400, but I think that perhaps the A400 is a more recent camera and would have more features.  <br>  <br>  Basically, I think you need to find out something about lenses first before you make some of your decisions.  The camera is only a small part of the photograph, the lens is the most important and insofar as Canon and Sony are concerned, I would go with Sony.

It does not produce audio.  The source of the audio is the components themselves (cable box, DVD player, gaming console).  You want to take the source of the audio and plug it into the speakers.  You never want to reroute the audio through your television.<br>  <br>  To do so you will need an audio/video receiver or home theater system (audio receiver only).  You take the component and plug your audio cables  (red and white) into the audio out and then the audio in on your receiver for the appropriate component (DVD in, Cable In, etc).  You then plug your speakers into your receiver.|`|AA10262868	www.tigerdirect.com
o6BDapZjaa	Bluetooth is a function of the phone, not of the network.  It's probably a question of which version of Bluetooth your phone has; the older one (v. 1.x) will only allow you to attach to a headset, whereas the newer ones (v. 2.x) will let you pair your device with any other Bluetooth-compatible device.<br>  <br>  You might want to consider getting the phone tools or suite for your particular brand of phone; you can usually download it from the manufacturer's web site for free.  With the appropriate USB cable (assuming your phone accepts one), you can attach your phone to a computer and manipulate files with the package.
QlROytniaa	All u need to do is call At&t and asked them for support. I have done that before and was easily fixed. No need for a new one.<br>  <br>   If u did  need a new one i am pretty sure they can migrate the info onto the new one if it is not damaged.
QoLL2ucGaa	No, you are not able to downloads songs for Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock.|`|EpvHhbByaa	No, GH3 for the wii will never get downloadable content.
LnYr2dLfaa	If you can access it then it should work. I remember when I was over at a friend's house he was playing an N64 emulator on his PS3 from his external hard drive. He said it was his secret and never told me how to do it.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	yes, i think you can|`|Xxviy63Paa	Yes, IF:<br>  <br>  the hard drive is formatted in Fat32 (not all Fat32 is the same, so it's best to let the ps3 format it)<br>  <br>  the hard drive is not passworded or encrypted, and the movies aren't on some secondary, secured partition<br>  <br>  the movies are in a ps3-compatible format (and codec). To avoid confusing yourself unnecessarily, learn the difference between formats and codecs.<br>  <br>  If your pc and ps3 are on a LAN, you can also use media streaming to do the same thing. You'll get perfect performance from a usb cable, though. Even a blu-ray movie won't exceed 280Mbps.|`|SVsaBrD9aa	Yes, but you will have to format the external hard drive first. Just follow the directions on this link.

LnYr2dLfaa	How did you get 2? The only way I can think of if they were transferred via SD Card, in which to erase them you either take out the SD Card or delete the SD Card's history in the Wii Settings.|`|3yNmclJgaa	You would need to softmod your Wii and then run the duplicate channel remover disc which can be obtained online.<br>  <br>  If you have a chipped Wii - your already sorted - you just need the duplicate channel remover.<br>  <br>  The reason you have them, is that you have updated from a game disc either not from the region you have on the console which is the usual problem.
VJ1C5JsYaa	Its not really something that can be fixed. This is normally caused by your internet connection re-establishing itself. When this happens you technically lose your connection for an extremely short amount of time. However in this time Xbox Live notices that you "disconnected" so it throws you out of the party and makes you have to reload the game. This normally happens just after your internet get connected and will normally happen less after your modem has been connected for a longer period of time.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	It does that to everyone.

LnYr2dLfaa	If the Rock Band game is for the PS2 then it should work, but not as well as the Singstar ones. As long as you have the connection to plug the microphones into (which you get from the Singstar games) and as long as the RB mic has the same connection as the SS ones.

YNJsvtlQaa	More than likely YES, because everything you buy off of itunes has some kind of lock, so that you can't put it on anything else.  They are pretty strict that way.  And if you delete it, you can't get it back, iTunes doesn't cover "deleting episode" in their "report a problem" to a song/episode/movie/app, sorry.|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	if you delete the episode you will have to pay to download it again<br>  the episode must reside on your computer not on flash drive
3yNmclJgaa	OK here is how to do it (there are two ways)<br>  <br>  1st way is to buy a PC dvd drive that can read the Wii discs as 99% cant.  They are specifically the LG models but you would have to do a google search for which models specifically.<br>  <br>  The 2nd way and probably the best way to go, is use the Disc Dumper application/channel on your Wii which will allow you to backup your legally owned discs to either SD card or a USB device.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|pksEGHCzaa	You can back them up but don't expect them to work when you copy it on a DVD again. The only for backed up games to work is to modify your Wii which you really shouldn't do. If you still want to know I guess its like anything else. Just put the disc into your computer and go to the files on the disc and copy them onto your computer.|`|jKc7aDCwaa	You can't just put the disc into a PC's DVD rom drive and back it up. There's only a few drives that can read Wii discs natively; everyone else who backs them up uses a homebrew application and sends them from the Wii itself since the Wii can read them. That, and the Wii needs to be modded in order to read the discs. <br>  <br>  And unfortunately, you can't go into detail on how to backup games on here because it's a violation of Yahoo's Terms of Service and it'll get reported for abuse. Not to mention backing up games is illegal per Nintendo's EULA, regardless of the DMCA fair use clause on backups.|`|xGzq2Eueaa	well u cant unless u get ur wii moded, burn the games on the computer and then put it on dvd but u need it hacked.

3CJAUyqPaa	Import directly? MiniDV tape based camcorders that do standard definition only. Your computer requires a firewire port. USB will not work. MovieMaker can't deal with HDV (at least, the XP version can't - the Vista version might - you can check that yourself - or if you are not running Vista, it does not matter). If your computer does not have a firewire port, hopefully it has an available expansion slot so you can add one. If you cannot or will not add one, then don't get a miniDV tape based camcorder.<br>  <br>  Flash memory or HDD? Probably none. Highly compressed MPEG2 files from standard def camcorders (including .mod) and .mov files from some pocket camcorders typically need to be converted with HandBrake, StreamClip or any number of other converters. MovieMaker cannot deal with MTS or M2TS AVCHD high definition files. In any case, the video data files copy from the camcorder to the computer over USB, then converted (if standard def) to a format MovieMaker can deal with - typically, but not limited to, .wmv or .avi. Remember, MovieMaker can't deal with AVCHD files.

oQya65FXaa	Since it is not just one game, there is most likely a problem with your disk-drive. It could be the laser or some other component. Try putting in a music CD, DVD Movie, or Blu-Ray Movie and see if it recognizes it. If it does, then I have no idea why the system won't recognize games (maybe you should clean them). If it doesn't recognizes the CD or DVD, then your disk drive is damaged and you need to send your PS3 to Sony for repairs.|`|AA10690306	I believe your BD drive has a common failure, it no longer recognizes which media you have in it.

I had the Gamecube version which got boring after maybe two weeks, and the DS version which took about a month to grow old. It depends on how long your patience is, and how much repetition you can take (a lot of the game time you spend will be picking fruit or fishing over and over again to make Bells). If you think that a month or so of playing a game is good value, then go for Animal Crossing, but remember that it is in real time, so if you want to take a break from it, chances are everyone will have moved away and your city will be overrun by weeds by the time you get back.<br>  Instead of Animal Crossing, you could play MySims (which is quite similar but longer lived) or Super Mario Galaxy.|`|F2O8IwrBaa	okay, first for me i play it for along time then get Board. but after a few minutes i remember A i know i want to see... then im back on.

Eau3vV2Baa	Program memory will not be affected by installing programs into storage memory in the device or expansion card. Program memory is only used for running programs.<br>  <br>  Some reasons why you are low in Program Memory. You think you closed the program, but in actuality, it is still running in the background. Unfortunately, Windows Mobile minimizes programs whenever you hit the 'x' button. Think of the 'x' button as the '_' button on the desktop/notebook computer when using Windows Mobile. Today screen plug-ins also chew up some Program Memory as well. The more you have on the Today screen, the more Program Memory it will take (depending on programs needs, etc).<br>  <br>  Some things you can do to free the Program Memory. You can go into System>Memory and check (I think-can't remember) 'running programs' tab. This is like Task Manager in Windows, but will display current programs running in background. Simply close the programs in this tab (this will actually close the program). Another method is to soft reset the device (this is similar to doing a restart on a desktop/notebook computer). I do this at least twice or three times a week to clear out the RAM (sometimes there are memory leaks, etc that can affect performance over time). There are utilities that help free up Program Memory in Windows Mobile (I personally use SKTools). There are other utilities that will allow better task management as well (I personally use SBSH iLauncher for this).<br>  <br>  HTH.

There was a lot of software issues not meshing well together and if I didn't work with technology on a daily basis or wasn't patient I would have thrown my phone out the window. Also, know that as soon as you do it, it will automatically void your 1 year manufacturer warranty.|`|z88IMXNFaa	The biggest downside is that you brick your phone.

SoUMckAfaa	Hi Vero,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately i've been in the same situation as you and have been looking for a free online mixer...most give you poor sound quality e.t.c and don't let you export to MP3. After much debate i ended up 'purchasing' an online one (<a href="http://www.makemusicbeatsonline.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.makemusicbeatsonline.com)</a> and it has actually been really helpful for me. It has a lot of high quality (192 kbps and higher) sounds and you can export it to MP3 once your done.<br>  <br>  If you can afford to shell out $30 - give it a go.

2btGvJexaa	Actually the GO phone tends to be the a little bit more as a contract plan without the contract. $20 a month is what every carrier except for Tmobile charges for unlimited texting, so its not a good deal or a bad deal...thats just the way it is. But when you do the math of paying a dollar a day on the days you use it your already at $30 a month, add $20 for texting that's $50. Then depending on how much you talk lets say 300 min, that's an extra $30..that's $100 a month. For that price you could sign up for the Sprint Simply Everything and never have to worry about any overages.. Then again you'd have to sign a contract. Hope this helps :]|`|5kYIteIHaa	They suck... you pay to much money... i suggest you get like Verizon and pay 50$ and you can get like a touch screen phone with like unlimited text and several mins.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Here in CA I see add on TV for the go phone at Radio Shack going for $29 for the phone
AA11510511	The answer to both your questions is no.  You have to give 28 days notice to end your contract with any network.<br>  <br>  To actually end your contract, you ( or the account holder) has to speak in person to the customer service department on your network.  This is the only way to end a contract.|`|ivOpNL8uaa	Well i don't understand why they are saying that because you  can my brother has done that a lot of times, they reallyshouldn'tt have a problem with it.|`|EImm4teRaa	I just canceled my contract over the phone and it was immediate.

legycdOFaa	The RRoD can appear at any time, depending on the nature of the fault. You can check your exact fault cause by following through the guide I've attached at the end of this post.<br>  <br>  Generally the RRoD is caused by the continuous heating up (expanding) and cooling (contracting) of the system board and attached components connected with shoddy solder and in the case of the heatsinks, bad mounting clamps.<br>  <br>  The best way and cheapest way (which does void your warranty) is to disassemble the 360, remove the motherboard, remove the heatsinks for the graphics chip and CPU, clean off the thermal paste and reapply some Artic Silver instead. Put the heatsinks back on and then after foil-wrapping the surrounding board areas for heat protection, slowly heat up the front and rear of the motherboard using a heat gun. This will allow the components to resettle with the heatsinks in place. Leave for 30 minutes to cool (it will take that long), then reassemble ;) There are guides for that all over the net, and youtube.<br>  <br>  I've fixed numerous 360's this way. You do need a heat gun (hairdryer isn't enough) and arctic silver (a few ￡) but you don't need new aftermarket heatsinks or anything else.<br>  <br>  What the towel trick does is try to deliberately overheat the box to get the components hot enough to resettle themselves. If it works, good for you, but it won't be as permanent a fix, not hot enoug ;)|`|XGFH2zRxaa	just wrap it in towels, wait 20 min and tada!!<br>  i told my friend that and it worked|`|9gdJNTajaa	I would listen to Yesh, buy the x-clamp exuipment.

But it is not water resistant and you would prob have to by certain casings to protect it from water. <br>  <br>  The Pentax Optio 30 and Olympus Stylus 1050 are waterproof cameras. But you have to be aware that they can only go down under water so far, and for a period of time. This is the same with all underwater resistant cameras.

TaxYLHbMaa	There are a few factors you will need to consider when you make a decision on the camera that you are looking at purchasing, primarily the best choice is usually what you have had luck with in the past, if you have had a particular model in the past which has been good, stick with it in the sense of the newer model available for the particular choices.<br>  <br>  If money is no object or factors less determined in the consideration buy a Sony or a canon, these two choices are best for the optical side of the choices available; these models have good optics in the optical zoom sides of things and equally good systems in place to drive the high end optics.<br>  <br>  Additionally another factor for consideration is the technology in general available , I would tend to point you in the direction of hdd or sd (hc) hybrid camera’s as a choice due to the amount of recording you can do without the worry of tapes additionally with this in consideration of a media to use , another factor for hard drive or SD (hc) is that you will not have to worry about battery consumption as much and generally they have less moving parts and things which drain batteries , and less wear on heads lasers and other things which tend to make lives of camera’s in general harder , another point is dv and mini DVD media have less room on the media , and usually have limited means to remove the media from the device.<br>  <br>  If you have a good budget of around $1000 look at the Canon HV20 HDV Camcorder (<a href="http://www.dvconfidential.com/non-video/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.dvconfidential.com/non-video/...</a> )<br>  Or the Sony Handycam HDR-SR12 (<a href="http://www.retrevo.com/samples/Camcorder..." rel="nofollow">http://www.retrevo.com/samples/Camcorder...</a> )<br>  <br>  If you have a budget of around $500 look at the <br>  <br>  <a href="http://camcorders.about.com/od/digitalca..." rel="nofollow">http://camcorders.about.com/od/digitalca...</a><br>  Panasonic SDR-H18 , Canon DC230 , Sony DVD308 , Sanyo Xacti E1<br>  <br>  JVC and other well known models should be considered if you are looking for cheaper models , but expect more problems possibly down the track , and Sony handy cams are a good choice for mid range budgets.<br>  <br>  Finally the best choices for the lower end would be the any of the svp T-series.

dnA6sAFqaa	Try using toothpaste. Put a little toothpaste on your finger and rub the toothpaste over the whole play side of the disc and then wipe away the excess toothpaste with a damp soft cloth - then rinse all toothpaste off with cold water and dry with soft cloth/towel.<br>  <br>  This is a fantastic method. I use it often for my daughter's DVDs and CDs and for my own computer discs (some of them quite old and scratched) and it works every time and takes very little time to do.

UK0HFbCyaa	Those toy like things are more trustworthy than people think. They work, and don't break as easily as people might think<br>  <br>  But they are far worse than regular digital cameras. I think you would be better off buying a real digital camera. Those range from 70 to 400 dollars depending on the type of camera (I'm assuming you want to buy a cheap digital camera, so I gave you the price range only of compact digital cameras)|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	You should be prepared to spend at least $100 for a fairly decent camera. Forget the toy you're looking at.|`|h5NP5HEwaa	I think not because it doesn't seem trustworthy, like what if it breaks down suddenly? Just get a normal digital camera , at least you can actually look at the pictures you took and not worry about the battery dying. Get a digital camera with lithium batteries, they don't die fast and are rechargeable.

oKh2CNYtaa	If you can afford it, the iPhone is getting good reviews.  On screen keyboard works very well.  It is, however, expensive.  Note that you can switch to an iPhone regardless of when you are in your plan (i.e. ok if you are still under contract).  However, it will switch your data contract to the iPhone plan, and you can not keep any business discounts.<br>  <br>  If the iPhone is too expensive or you really want no plan changes, you might consider the Treo smartphones and/or 8525.  <br>  <br>  The 8525 is a slider with a keyboard under the screen kinda like the sidekick.  It uses windows mobile, which does have a million options,  but may find confusing to use.  The 8525 is fast (3g data), expandable, has a big screen and reports say it has good sound quality.   Note that all that results in a somewhat large phone.<br>  <br>  The Treo is a bar type with either windows or palm os.  The Palm software is easier to use, but is getting a bit dated (it works fine, but isn't as "cool" looking)  The Treo keyboard works great.  It is somewhat smaller than the 8525.  <br>  <br>  The other two keyboard options are the blackjack and the blackberrys.  <br>  <br>  The blackjack has windows mobile and no touch screen.  Windows just doesn't work as well without a touch screen in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  The blackberrys are excellent email phones. If you want to link to corporate email servers they are the first choice.  But the OS is neither very very good like the iPhone or easily expandable like Palm and Windows.  Probably would not be my choice unless you want that corporate email link.<br>  <br>  Good Luck in finding your phone.

Io ho comprato Forza Motorsport 2 tre mesi fa e ogni giorno mi piace sempre di piu. E un gioco fantastico. La carriera praticamente e infinita, per completare tutte le gare comunque ci metti un bel po. E di un realismo stupefacente e la grafica non e da meno. I danni sono perfetti e anche dal punto di vista di sonorita e ottimo. E il miglior simulatore e credo che lo sai gia. Ho provato il live ed e famtastico. Adoro il fatto oltre a fare gare eccezzionali e divertenti parlando con gli altri, quello di fare soldi vendendo le mie auto all'asta. E un gioco fantastico che non puo mancare a uno che e appena appena appasionato di auto. Te lo consiglio, non rimarrai deluso. Ciao<br>  P.S. TOKYO HOTEL M_E_R_D_A. Beh sono un jazzista quindi questo e proprio inaccetabile per me!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4TW5Ngetaa	 "Fallout 3" (Bethesda Softworks).
