cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	I agree with your analogy, but their is one HUGE difference:  Global warming might be the largest economic scam in history.  People, especially researchers, on both sides of this issue are guilty.  If we decide that "climate change" is natural and is not a result of our activity, the federal money spigot would have to be shut off.  As studies begin to PROVE that the Earth's temps. are flatlining, and even beginning to cool, Liberals arguments are shifting to "Climate Change".  My belief is that many Leftists KNOW it's a scam, but it's also a way to change/legislate behavior.  Hybrid cars, energy subsidies, crappy lightbulbs, cap and trade policy, (which is more of an attack on capitalism than has anything to do with the environment), light rail systems that nobody use, the list goes on forever. I'm all for lessening our footprint on The Earth, but I hate the Activists shoving it down my throat based on lies.<br>  <br>  ***ADDED  -  Hey Elle sorry to bother you with my denial, but could you explain why global temps have flatlined for the last 7 years, even though greenhouse gas emissions are up?  This isn't fringe kook crap, it was on freakin ABC News last night.  Am I in denial that Geologists are predicting a period of global cooling?  I'm certainly not denying that all but the kookiest of you people, even the GREAT OBAMA, have stopped the "global warming" mantra, and started in on "climate change"!!!!  Yes the Earth's temps are changing, but NOBODY knows why, and the "Green" agenda is more about being anti-capitalist, and changing behavior than it is about the environment.|`|cDZJgM4jaa	There isn't a genetic factor to choice. Maybe people have inherited a certain temperament, but there is no genetic factor to whether or not someone is gay or believes a certain thing.<br>  <br>  The difference between thinking a gene exists that causes gayness and believing global warming exists is that global warming is a proven fact.

We all start our lives with our organs in the female orientation and our sexuality undergoes final modifications in the womb.  We all end up with a different mix of hormones and we all are different physically and genetically and then you have to mix in environmental factors.<br>  <br>  Note: I didn't say behavior wasn't a factor.  That is where environmental factors come in.  Clearly some people are born gay.  Other's probably learn it.    I would acknowledege  that the search for it might resemble the search for AGW.  When you look for something, there is an incentive to provide results to those that provided the research funds and they want to push an agenda.

Heat is energy but if there is too much of it, we have so expend our own energy to balance it out and keep our body cooler than the surrounding temperature. we do that by sweating. Heat also makes our cells less efficient and our blood has to do a lot more work to remove heat from our cells. along with providing energy to our cells, the blood circulation system also works as the cooling system.<br>  <br>  All these things start consuming a lot of our own energy and we start to feel tired and lazy.|`|5628ec20b00d1a53d79e14cda6f420f9aa	Heat is energy-  In this situation and in simplified terms - it is energy exerted on the human body, not by or for the body, causing it to slow down, exert greater energy to overcome it or be efficient.|`|z4V9kdR8aa	When it's hot outside, your body has to adjust by sweating more.

ZAi5w4aTaa	Chickens:  There are 3 types of chickens, dual purpose, meat, and layers.  As the name suggests, layers are the egg producers, but they will only lay eggs for about 2 years.  The problem with layers is that they produce almost no meat, they are very small and light birds, butchering them is almost pointless.  Dual purpose chickens will lay eggs, and produce some meat, but when butchered the will only weigh about 4 lbs max.  The chickens that I raise are White Rock's, they are a heavy meat bird, and it is a good idea that you are free ranging them, thats what I do with mine.  The heaviest bird I have raised was 13.1 lbs.  As for how long to keep your birds; layers can be keep until they stop laying, but as for the other two types I only keep White Rocks for 4 - 5 months tops, dual purpose a little longer.  But I would not suggest eating any bird kept longer then a year, the meat will be very tough.  <br>  <br>  Pigs:  For pigs, 3 years is about the max you want to have them before you get them slaughtered.  I made the mistake once of slaughtering some of mine when they were about 1.5 years old, there wasn't much meat.<br>  <br>  Cattle:  Normally, I slaughter my cattle when they are 3-4 years old, any older and the quality of the meat starts to degrade.  3 years is about the optimum age for any breed, except Charolais (Shar-Lay), they can be slaughtered when they are 2 years old; they are a very hearty breed of cattle, but they are also very expensive.<br>  <br>           I hope this helps, and good luck.<br>  **P S. if you are free ranging your chickens, you might have to really watch out for predators like foxes, coyotes, and wolves.  I have lost entire batches of chickens to these.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Andy gave a great answer. In general animals for food don't live a long life, the meat would be too tough. If you keep a chicken coupe, which I did most of my life you keep 2 types of chickens, laying and eating. You can eat older chickens that is what Coq au Vin is for. You take a tough old bird and cook it for a long time in wine. <br>  <br>  There is a great book I would like to recommend. Animal, Vegetable, Miracle by Barbara Kingslover. She was a suburbanite who moved to a farm to live off the land. It is a very entertaining book with lots of insight for anyone considering that type of move.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	For your non-egg laying chickens, you can start killing them after they are full grown which is in a few months.  For pigs, you usually butcher them after a year.  For cattle, it is best to wait three or four year when they are full grown.  Both sets of my grandparents were farmers and this is the time frames that they used.

It takes energy to create virtually everything and even if the product is produced without any energy needed, transporting it and all the associated things along the way (like putting it in shops, etc) make that product still have energy associated with it.<br>  <br>  Reuse is important in the cases that do work, and much better than throwing it away, whether that's in the regular bin or the recycle bin.<br>  <br>  And then recycle. Hopefully this is just a tiny amount after reducing and reusing. What you need to keep in mind is that recycling is best when there's no other option. We should all do it ni those cases. But the actual system of consumption that we've created makes recycling (almost) essential, as virtually all packaging is built for it. This is actually reinforcing our throwaway society, and the recycling that material still uses a lot of energy.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Start with Reduce and you will have less need to do either of the others.|`|5TKEtXERaa	The 3 R's are in order almost everywhere that talks about them.<br>  <br>  1.

REUSE  if something is already in existence and you find another use for it that makes you not have to produce something from virgin material or it prevents it from being thrown away (or even recycled which takes energy) then it is important<br>  <br>  3. RECYCLE  even though it is dead last by far it is urgent that we do this because combining the fact of preventing new production using virgin materials and preventing items from going to landfill is crucial|`|Homzf386aa	prevention is better than cure,so reduce is first chioce,when spernding not take place u are saving some amount so re use comes under that catogarey,nothing is waste in this world recycle comes under that tottaly  the three are like water food o2 for the man .every one should follow this like as theire national anthom.good luck from positve raj saravanan|`|215e8f63a273a9d5cbab203c741c8cecaa	They are each equally important.  Any two are pointless in absence of the other one.  They rely on one another's unique purposes to make their own worthwhile and efficient.  It is really best to view it as one action with three different steps.  When it is approached as three separate actions that have nothing to do with one another then they can actually become quite wasteful.|`|da54f9f0b9659eba1ca803ffad07da13aa	By reusing you are already reducing. Then recycle when finished. So I would say reusing would be the best solution.|`|pQfaHAbraa	I have observed that reuse and recycling are in many cases used as an excuse to waste more: from plastic forks, to plastic bags, and all kinds of trashy disposables. The best answer I have is that reuse is way the most important, and it is no wonder it is mentioned first. <br>  <br>  Let's remind ourselves and others that care, that:<br>  <br>  -- if you are going to wash that plastic fork to reuse it, you may as well wash a reusable one. <br>  <br>  --If you are going to recycle that plastic container, you still need to wash it to do so, so you may as well use a reusable one.<br>  <br>  --If you are thinking of reusing that plastic bottle, bear in mind some plastic leach toxins, so you are way better off using a safe reusable container instead.<br>  <br>  --If you are going to reuse that plastic bag to go shopping, you may as well have a reusable one, to show you are avoiding the waste altogether.<br>  <br>  --Remember all that plastic waste is hardly recyclable. A few kinds of  plastics can only be downcycled into lower grade junk, which means they will end up as toxic waste in a cycle or two anyways. Most plastics are not even downcyclable.<br>  <br>  By all means, recycle, or downcycle as much as possible, but focus on avoiding the trash in the first place. <br>  <br>  Reduce your use of things. Just take a moment when you bring things to your life, to consider whether you really need them.<br>  <br>  Reuse the things you have, but focus on reusing things that will not pollute after you are done with them, that yo can either compost or truly recycle once they are no longer usable.<br>  <br>  And Recycle.|`|3659d19b27793eea0c368e983435205eaa	It is best to do all three.Almost everything is recycled these days.cut back on what you do not really need. find secondary things that you can do with the used packaging.(butter containers for storage) etc.If you have kids you can find different things to make with all this stuff.Recycle all that you can.Recycling is always more  helpful to all of us and our kids.<br>  More on reuse: you can cut 1 gallon milk containers in 1/2 and use them for planters. decorate them with your kids.put a couple holes in the bottom for drainage and now you have an original and unique planter.what is leftover you recycle.<br>  Go to ask.com.

npBCankMaa	the laws of thermodynamics address this.  Every time you convert energy from one form to another, you lose energy.  Take electricity, it doesn't exist so we take energy in fuels and burn them to make heat, this is a chemical reaction in burning.  Burning loses energy.  Then the heat is used to make steam so we had heat and kinetic and potential energy in the form of high temp and press on the steam.  This loses energy.<br>  <br>  We take the steam and the turbines, which is a mechanical energy.  Finally, the mechanical Kenitec energy of the turbine spinning makes electricity, at another lose.  If you charge a battery to make chemical energy and use the battery to run a car, you reverse the chemical energy to make electricity and eventually make mechanical energy to run the car, more loses.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, we must use energy with as few steps as possible.  Burning natural gas to heat a house has only one step.  Burning natural gas to make electricity to run cars has 10 steps and we lose so much energy that it is nearly sinful.|`|n4ie8Hidaa	yes it is an good idea but who will listen at u everyone just laugh and go away!!|`|cHlkddonaa	your idea is very good, only problem is that various companies already manufacturing wind mills and other products based on that idea. you can watch a video of bicycle dynamo battery charger on this website<br>  www.urjaghar.com

This is because less energy is used to convert and existing structure than to build new.<br>  <br>  It will also be cheaper, however the headache will be bigger.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend, better insulation, radiant barrier, better windows and or window energy film. <br>  <br>  You may also want to look into the follwoing:<br>  ground source heat pumps<br>  radiant heating<br>  solar water heating<br>  inline tankless water heaters<br>  energy recovery ventilation<br>  traum walls<br>  thermal masses|`|Homzf386aa	it is up to ur financial power but building is better than converting one to green house
fwnqB0dTaa	They don't care what someone says about Climate Change.<br>  <br>  In their eyes, everyone who understands the science, and what is going on, whether they state it's going to happen in thousands of years, or in a decade, is an alarmist.<br>  <br>  I don't dispute there are alarmists out there, spouting rubbish about timescales, but they lump these in with proper Climatologists, who put forward the true story.|`|npBCankMaa	No, that would be called stereotyping or racial profiling, we are more mature and politically correct.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	Description of alarmist - American Heritage? Dictionary<br>  NOUN: A person who needlessly alarms or attempts to alarm others, as by inventing or spreading false or exaggerated rumors of impending danger or catastrophe. alarmism<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't think that there is an official definition regarding AGW but I will try to begin.  Since everyone is different, many characteristics are not shared by all.<br>  1. They believe that humans are a negative influence on the planet  <br>  2  They believe that governments provide viable solutions to most problems<br>  3 . They are generally well educated<br>  4.  They are generally on the political left (many of which consider themselves moderate)<br>  5.  They tend to readily believe in things such as acid rain is going to destroy the forest, CFCs is going to destroy the ozone, we are running out of resouces<br>  6.  They are generally young, idealistic, and want to save the planet<br>  7.  They tend to be over confident regarding the extent of their knowledge.<br>  8. From aaron, accentuate the negative effects and minimize the positive effects.<br>  9. Attribute bad things that have nothing to do with AGW <br>  10. They tend to lump other crises with AGW (i.e Katrina)<br>  11 From Bucket: They tend to want to go with the crowd and endlessly talk about concensus even when one doesn't exist.  it merely exists in their circles.<br>  12. They tend to make decisions based on emotion rather than reason.<br>  <br>  It is a good question.  Clearly my answer needs work.  I will try to edit it as addition thoughts come to mind.  <br>  <br>  Dawai is a poor example of an alarmist.  He doesn't fit well into these definitions. He is probably young but learning.  I expect his alarmism to end in 10 years or so.  Bucket on the otehr hand may need some help to have his alarmism exorcized.<br>  <br>  I should be careful what I wish for but will a question now be given to describe skeptics.  It should be good for a laugh.|`|aWTo9K22aa	The people who use this word think that anyone who raises any kind of alarm over anything is being irrational. They feel they are being more rational by being calm. Is it rational to be calm and patient if the problem is indeed real and immediate?|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Deniers consider anyone who thinks that global warming will have any negative effects 'alarmist'.|`|0hdo4WORaa	All I see is name calling on both sides, Where is the science?|`|fcc738a2832b685c939f31eb779b66a2aa	Well, one characteristic of alarmism is refusal to notice any beneficial effects of increased global temperatures or higher levels of CO2 -- like fewer people freezing to death and longer, better growing seasons, for example.  <br>  <br>  Another characteristic is the tendency to attribute to global warming effects that are not related or that should be reduced by warming.  For example global warming should theoretically cause wetter deserts, fewer droughts and fewer hurricanes because of more uniform temperatures and higher atmospheric moisture -- but deserts and hurricanes and droughts are typically attributed to global warming by alarmists.|`|zince8g1aa	"They believe that humans are a negative influence on the planet"<br>  <br>  That would be nearly the entire scientific community, with regards to global warming, which makes those who throw around the term "alarmist" look quite silly.  "Alarmist" implies there's little to worry about.  The science indicates otherwise.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_...</a><br>  <br>  Sample:<br>  <br>  Joint academies:  "2008-In preparation for the 34th G8 summit, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a declaration reiterating the position of the 2005 joint science academies’ statement, and reaffirming “that climate change is happening and that anthropogenic warming is influencing many physical and biological systems.” Among other actions, the declaration urges all nations to “(t)ake appropriate economic and policy measures to accelerate transition to a low carbon society and to encourage and effect changes in individual and national behaviour.”<br>  <br>  American Geophysical Union:<br>  <br>  "The Earth's climate is now clearly out of balance and is warming. Many components of the climate system—including the temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean, the extent of sea ice and mountain glaciers, the sea level, the distribution of precipitation, and the length of seasons—are now changing at rates and in patterns that are not natural and are best explained by the increased atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols generated by human activity during the 20th century. Global average surface temperatures increased on average by about 0.6°C over the period 1956–2006. As of 2006, eleven of the previous twelve years were warmer than any others since 1850. The observed rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice is expected to continue and lead to the disappearance of summertime ice within this century."<br>  <br>  "The Geological Society of America (GSA) supports the scientific conclusions that Earth’s climate is changing; the climate changes are due in part to human activities; and the probable consequences of the climate changes will be significant and blind to geopolitical boundaries. Furthermore, the potential implications of global climate change and the time scale over which such changes will likely occur require active, effective, long-term planning."<br>  <br>  "In February 2007, after the release of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, the Royal Meteorological Society issued an endorsement of the report. In addition to referring to the IPCC as “world’s best climate scientists”, they stated that climate change is happening as “the result of emissions since industrialization and we have already set in motion the next 50 years of global warming – what we do from now on will determine how worse it will get.”<br>  <br>  EDIT <br>  <br>  Jim,<br>  <br>  I find that contrarians who hang around the denialsphere tend to have quite a skewed view of both the science and the scientific community.  The denialsphere is a cult-like atmosphere - one that provides positive reinforcement for their beliefs.
