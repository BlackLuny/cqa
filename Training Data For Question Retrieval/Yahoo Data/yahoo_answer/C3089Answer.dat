nrTVlo8Eaa	This is a shame. Did they take your receipt along with the item? If not, then I would get a telephone number for Target's corporate office in Minneapolis MN and call their customer service department. Don't be impatient with the people on the phone, but don't take no for an answer.<br>  <br>  Even if they DID take your receipt, you still have the right to call the head office and ask for help. <br>  <br>  Basically they've stolen your merchandise and you have no way to prove it.<br>  <br>  If you read their return policy, you don't have to state a reason for your return and you followed all of the other rules too. It's not your problem that their UPC data base was incorrectly programmed. I bet if you were to take the same exact item off the shelf to one of their scanners that they locate on their aisles, you'll find that since then they've reprogrammed their database to reflect the correct description and price.<br>  <br>  Whatever you choose to do, I would do it as soon as you can. The longer you wait, the worse your case will be for getting at least a sincere apology from the head office.<br>  <br>  I looked at their corporate website, and their annual report for 2006 lists a Patricia Adams as Senior Vice President, Apparel Merchandising. They list a resource number that MIGHT be helpful: 1.800.440.0680<br>  <br>  It may not seem that at the store level that you are valued as a customer, but the people at the upper levels DO want to hear how their products and services are failing and where they can use some insight.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|U5dCFomCaa	ok.. well i was at h&m and i was just trying on clothes. the lady that worked in the fitting room told me stuff but i wasn't really paying attention because i was kind of already tired. so after i come out, i leave my clothes in the fitting room because i thought that's what she said. i was thinking, 'wtf? why would she want my clothes there?' i thought of bringing it but i thought she said not to so i didn't. then i come out then she said 'where are your clothes..?' and i got confused. then i pointed to the fitting room and left because my brother was leaving me and my sister. so after we left, i went to gap because my brother waned to look at their suits. we were in the store for like 5-7 minutes and then all of a sudden this guy came up to me. he told me was security for h&m and i was like 'OMG THAT STUPID LADY' i seriously wanted to throw rocks at her. dumb girl. so he asked me all this crap in front of everyone i was like wtf. my brother was like, "you can check her bag if you want" then he gave attitude like, "naww i ain't here to start sh!t or anything." unbelievable. stupid. i started despising h&m after that.|`|AA12058041	this happened to one of my daughters target i think does this on purpose my daughter vooiced her opinion nothing happened to her but i believe she called a district manager i dont think she got too far if you have in your newspaper write a letter to the editor let the public in your towne know what target does and how they treat their customers i always have felt you get customers back with honey not vinegar take it as a life experience and just know how unjust they are i know it would really anger me call and tell them you will stand across the street from then and have a sign on how target treats customers on a lagit return  it really angers yeah i know well good luck and dont shop there no more
qxrr69bnaa	If you're the addressee (person receiving the package), all you have to do is take your ID to the PO to get your package.  You don't need the notice that was left.  <br>  <br>  If someone will be home, you can have it redelivered.  You can go to the USPS website, www.usps.org, and in the Contact Us section, request a redelivery.<br>  <br>  There is no requirement that the USPS try to redeliver your package.
qxrr69bnaa	Unless you request it, the USPS will not attempt to redeliver your package.  What did you do with the notice that was left?  There is a section on it for redelivery.  If it is something that has to be signed for, someone must be home to sign for it.  You can put a note in your mail box for the mail carrier to redeliver the package.  Or you can go to the USPS website and request redelivery.<br>  <br>  You need to contact the USPS as soon as possible.  Packages can be held for as little as 5 days and as long as 10 days.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	It sounds like most likely it has been returned already.|`|0unqJPehaa	Call to make sure they will redeliver it first, I was left a notice for a package and was told they would redeliver it, they lied. I waited the next day, no one came and went down there and was told they don't redeliver.<br>  <br>  Anyway you can go here. <a href="https://redelivery.usps.com/duns/Redelivery.jsp" rel="nofollow">https://redelivery.usps.com/duns/Redeliv...</a>
AA10350396	I've done it.A few times. It works out pretty good, though you have to check and make sure about the option to substitute for items that are out of stock. If you don't click that option ( if your store offers it) then they will replace it with some of like type. You might be put off by that if you are particular abut the items. You may also find that sometimes you don't always get the sale prices on some items. I find some stores do not extend that to online purchases, though most do. <br>  <br>  Overall, I've been very happy with it. Kind of weird to have groceries delivered like back in the day. Plus they don't acdept tips ( so they say, but I'm sure if you tried to....)|`|AA11700955	Peapod is a great source.

EkBgpq8Laa	Without wishing to be patronising you need to tell them about your work experience and relate it to the job you are applying for! Presumably you have a job specification along with the application form.<br>  Read through it and basically explain how you can do what they are asking, relating to experiences you have had at work.<br>  if you havent worked you need to try and relate it to something else you have done at school/college or even at home.|`|uDPI8XTZaa	put yourself in their position, they want someone who likes doing that sort of stuff, so you'll be happy at work and if you enjoy doing something your usually good at it, say you've done it voluntarily or in your spare time, a few fibs wont hurt. good luck|`|jgP51MlRaa	They want to know if you've had any experience of being a text operator.  If not tell them why you think you would make a good text operator.<br>  <br>  If you have no experience, don't lie about it, just say your eager to learn, learn things quickly ans enjoy a new challenge.<br>  <br>  maj|`|d760aa17e6cd1c95f7f12a88a6d874ccaa	You need to show that you know about the job, I don't know what a text operator is. I would guess that you need a reasonable grasp of English, so check your spellings and grammar. Sell yourself tell them why you have applied, what you are good at, if you have any interests that may help in this type of work.|`|dxlGBE2Yaa	They are obviously wanting to hear about previous job experience in the same field, or some talent that would make you a good text operator such as good English grades, etc.<br>  <br>  The again, you could just say, <br>  "I wnt dis job 4 me ok!"<br>  Sorry...couldn't resist...good luck with the job Claire.  :)
