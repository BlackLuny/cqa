I usually skip a question if I don't have the answer. Is it an universal question that most ppl can relate to? Add details: this usually enlightends those who r too lazy to google anythin or use Wikipedia! Keep on trying and they will eventually anser yourquestions. I don't really see anything wrong with what you are asking!|`|67KsVV9qaa	ok tell me what is your question and email me your question on ranazaryab@yahoo.com|`|olaj2ZwOaa	Im sure if you ask silly questions your most likely to get answers
lV8i73unaa	Can you give the link to the question, please?    It might be easier for all of us to answer your question if we have all of the facts.    Have a great night!    *smile*    **EDIT:  I said nothing about reporting your question, nor had I planned on reporting it!  Where did that come from????  I simply wanted to see the question that you were referring to!!!!|`|e158WyFGaa	No,you cant it did the same thing to me =(|`|GJbziTG2aa	Yup.|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	yeaa|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	If their was something wrong with the question in the first place then more than likely it will be reported again!|`|xHI2QwOtaa	No, it is not still an open question. It means that the time to respond to the question is over, and you must now choose a best answer. Note the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button below me. Please click it.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	I haven't seen the "Question period expired" yet.  I'm not sure if this should be interpreted as the question is in voting, or if it's still open for new answers somehow.    If it's still open to new answers, you would be able to choose the best answer yourself.  There will be a button beside each answer that says Choose as Best Answer for this.  But if it's gone to voting, you have just the 1 vote, and other people could outvote your choice.  Here the button will read Vote as Best Answer.  Voting is open for 2 days, and if the question isn't resolved by 1 answer receiving more votes, or No Best Answer having the majority, it will stay in voting until someone breaks the tie.    You can find out how much longer the question is open or will stay in voting by looking for a grayed out time somewhere below the question.  It will say something along the lines of  "4 minutes ago - 3 days left to answer." if the question is open or "1 day ago - 1 day left for voting" OR "1 week ago (Tiebreaker)" if the question is in voting.    If the question was reposted by Yahoo! after you appealed, there's always a chance that it could be reported again.  But since you already won on appeal once, I don't imagine that another report on the same violation would be accepted.  If you received emails from Yahoo! about the overturn, I'd save them for a while just in case.  It wouldn't hurt to be able to send them back to Yahoo! should the question get reported again for the same thing.  Or someone might report it for a different reason if more than 1 type of violation applied.  From what you provided about the question, I would guess it might have been reported as Adult Content, which seems to me to be a stretch so it was overturned.  But if you posted more than just what you said here, there could be violations for chat, or you might have posted something insulting someone who gave an answer you didn't like.      It's hard to answer in more than just generalities without seeing the actual question.

5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	A yahoo address can only be deleted by deleting your yahoo account.      To delete your yahoo account click this link.   https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_use...                  Your yahoo account comes as a package and you can only delete the whole package that includes the following:          * Yahoo answers. (Your questions and answers will remain).                     * Flickr.      * Yahoo Mail.     * Yahoo notepad.     * My Yahoo.     * Any other yahoo program that needs your Yahoo ID and password.    Once a yahoo account is deleted it and its contents cannot be recovered.  IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE YAHOO ACCOUNT CHECK THAT ONLY THE ACCOUNT YOU WANT TO DELETE IS SIGNED IN.     This is a delete you yahoo account alternative. Leave the account dormant for 4 months and yahoo will automatically delete the account.

Click on that and it will take you to the first page of Home with the new incoming questions.<br>  <br>  You will notice the new incoming questions are not sorted by categories.  Just click on the questions you can answer.  You click on the Home link again when you are finished submitting your response.  <br>  <br>  You can scroll down to the bottom of the page to the link 'More Open Questions>'.

You can just click through each page and respond to  the questions you can answer.<br>  <br>  These questions are not catagorized and are listed as they enter the system.  The Catagories listing just makes it more interesting to answer the questions in an ordered way.

Some people are too embarrassed to ask someone they know, so they ask here.

b48445c1a66e4554906a1ff5ae5c340faa	the most common reason for yahoo messenger crashing on a click event (like double click or right click a name in your friends list, clicking in smileys, clicking on audibles etc), is due to a skin issue or an attempt to skin yahoo messenger... again the most common cause of this is when you are already running a program like Windows Blinds ( or the alienguise themes), XNeat or some other window / desktop enhancement program... any program that adds extra buttons, changes the colour of your windows, adds transparency or allows you to keep the window on top or change the look of the windows in anyway (not including standard XP themes)... sometimes you will get an error message, sometimes Yahoo Messenger will just automatically close. <br>  <br>  if you have Windows Blinds and want to disable themes on Yahoo! Messenger which will resolve the conflict we have an article about how to do that at <a href="http://www.wackyb.co.nz/Yahoo!_Messenger_and_Windows_Blinds/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wackyb.co.nz/Yahoo!_Messenger...</a><br>  basically it states to...<br>  right click on yahoo icon go to properties,<br>  then compatibility,(Tab)<br>  then check disable visual themes.<br>  Click Apply<br>  Click OK<br>  <br>  if that fails to work (it's dependant on Windows Blinds version and Yahoo Messenger version), then try...<br>  add Yahoo Messenger to your Per Applications.<br>  Right-click on the systray Icon of WindowBlinds > Configure WindowBlinds<br>  (under Settings, Click on the Category) Per Application > add Per application (button at the bottom of the window)<br>  > and then browse for your Yahoomessenger executable file. (yahoomessenger.exe)<br>  This should prevent Windowblinds from attempting to skin Yahoo Messenger and thus eliminate the chances of a clash with this program.<br>  under Total Exclusion<br>  select Ignore this application and do not skin it<br>  click OK<br>  <br>  <br>  or do a search on <a href="http://www.wackyb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wackyb.com</a> for window blinds as it's discussed there often :)<br>  <br>  if its not the above, next most common cause is Flash...<br>  make sure you have download and installed flash from Internet explorer (not any other browser)<br>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/...</a>|`|e439f103649ebdbc31c7d4a1d7358717aa	Hmm, try this.

THEN, go to your facebook and disable the messages that it's sending you.|`|DGIUaDLYaa	If you do not want the messages to come through you can go to mail options and block them. Or, you can create a new mail folder then set a filter (in mail options) just for email from that particular sender.

If your password falls into the wrong hands, someone can easily impersonate you while online, sign your name to online service agreements or contracts, engage in transactions, or change your account information. So, choose your password carefully and then keep it safe from others.<br>  <br>  A password is like a toothbrush: Choose a good one and don't share it. A Yahoo! password can be any length, and can contain spaces, symbols, or numbers. With so many options, you should be able to come up with a password that's easy for you to remember but impossible for someone else to figure out. A password is a secret that only you should know.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips for choosing a strong password — one that is difficult to guess. <br>  <br>  *  Choose a password you'll remember. It should be memorable for you (so that you don't have to write it down or leave it in the open), but difficult for others to guess. <br>  Avoid using a word. Avoid a complete word from a dictionary (English or otherwise) or a name. <br>  *  Use at least 7 characters. The more characters your password contains, the harder it is for someone to guess it. A long but simple password can be safer than a short, complex one — and often easier to remember. <br>  *  Use a combination of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and standard symbols (! @ # $ % ^ & *). Your Yahoo! password is case-sensitive, which means that a capital letter A is different from a lowercase a. <br>  *  Don't use personal information that someone could easily figure out. Avoid a password based on information easily obtained about you (like your birthday, your child or pet's name, phone number, license plate number, employer, school name, automobile brand, or street name). Don't use a password you already use for another account, such as your bank account PIN. And don't use your Yahoo! ID (or other user name) in any form (such as reversed, capitalized, or doubled). <br>  *  Avoid the obvious. Don't make it easy for attackers by repeating a digit or letter (like "111111" or "FFFFFF") or any other common sequence of characters (like "123456"). Stay away from obvious passwords such as "test" or "password." When you change your password, change several characters; don't just append a number like "2" to the end. And make sure anyone watching you enter your password can't guess it as you type (such as a password typed using a single hand, like "qwerty"). <br>  *  Put a new spin on a familiar phrase. Pick a favorite phrase or lyric for your password. To shorten it, substitute letters with a number or a standard symbol or remove vowels. For example, "fredsboy" can be made into "Fr3d$boy." Shorten "two tickets to paradise" to "2Tickets2Paradiz," or combine "cat" and "dog" into "cAt!Do8." <br>  *  If you use a password generator, be careful. Make sure you can identify and trust the creator of a password management or generator program. Never share any personal information unless you trust the company or person you're working with. Online password-generator programs can help you create a random password that is generally harder to crack but also more difficult to remember. You can find password generators in the Yahoo! Directory category for System Utilities.>> <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/Computers/Software/System_Utilities/">http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Econom...</a>|`|880e800410043475e376b12a4e787c07aa	nearer to sign out there is my account go  there will change password.... and do it....

Since your friend has unlimited texting, like I do, he won't be charged.    BTW ~ I have MSN and Yahoo! messages forwarded to my phone.

IdlaZQ8Jaa	I didn't answer your other question because it already has a great answer and I gave that answer a thumbs up.      first of all how can I find out if she likes me is the most over looked question in singles and dating-meaning that a ton of people just skipped it because it is the question that it is.     secondly- if you think she likes you, and you like her you just have to take a chance and hope for rejection. err hope you don't get rejected. Talk to her straight out and get to the point.  don't beat around the bush.|`|Q3WweuOCaa	So ask...I'll answer you.|`|7NG6OHZbaa	Well, sometimes there are questions that people don't know the answer to or don't find the question interesting.     Try asking questions that are more interesting and more simple.    She probably likes you if she tries to get your attention a lot or looks at you constantly. If that doesn't help try talking to her and if she is out going or a interesting kind person to talk to then go out with her!!    Hope this helps! ( I will be sure to keep a watchful eye of your questions and try my best to answer them.)|`|zdlzjZgeaa	wait. someone will give a serious answer eventually...|`|qJrTQaGAaa	Well to find out if a girl likes you.... if thats what your asking depends on if she seems to be acting dif around you or not ie blushing or something whenever you talk to her or she could be giving hints by like flirting or something  i guess it really depends on the girl but im sure you could find out by asking friends of hers or something but more than likely you could sense it or not|`|92qrkRVlaa	Because. They be bitchin'|`|yZ7G5Cpcaa	Honestly? Talk to the girl. Yeah, yeah, you've heard it, I know.    Seriously though, girls like being talked to about things of that nature. You may find it awkward but talking to her would definitely "get you on the board", if you know what I mean.    If you just flat out don't want to talk to her, you could read her body language when you're around her. If she looks at you for a second, looks away, then looks back at you, she's studying you and talking to her would be a good option. There are lots of things you could look for.    Common sense can come in handy if you don't feel like asking around anymore or reading up on any "sure-fire tricks". I know I wouldn't.|`|Um7mYM71aa	I "answered it".

Mail plus is needed for pop forwarding to use with outlook and other mail progs which have the read receipt option, but it costs 19.99$ a year for US accounts (free for UK accounts).     Note: even when using mail plus or any of the other mail progs, you do not have the guaranty that you get a read receipt because a recipient can opt out of sending such notices. Reason behind this: by denying a read receipt, you make sure that spammers don't know whether they hit a real mail address.

TYzNTT7caa	Of course a clipboard is one of those particle boards with a metal clip and a spring at the top. Coaches carry them at games to have a hard surface on which to write.    I think what you mean is a computer clipboard. It's an analogy. When you cut text or a picture by using "control X" the text is then held in memory until you replace it with other data. It is placed "on the clipboard," as it were.    On a computer you really can have only one item on a clipboard at one time. If you want to have multiple items available, you have to deposit them somewhere, like stack them up in a blank document in Microsoft Word. You can then copy the whole document in Word and send that to yourself, cutting and pasting the individual items as you need them later.    I'm not sure that I am answering your question.

7u77AiBjaa	The problem is that Yahoo! 360 is a beta (i.e. testing) service and some features do not work correctly. It's been this way since 2005. So, glitches/problems were likely and using the service is a risk for users. Modules have become more glitchy since Yahoo! announced that they would no longer fix 360-related bugs starting October 2007, as they prepared to transition the service to a universal profile system. This UPS has started as of October 16, 2008, but the 360 transition to that platform hasn't been completed yet.    Some people can only upload 1 or no pics, so consider yourself fortunate. You may still find people with 4 pics in the module though. Make sure that the image that you are using is a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB that's saved to your hard drive.    If you happen to have a red x in a spot, you can delete a remaining picture to possible get rid of that empty placeholder. But really, I recommend that you leave the module completely alone because it can cause other serious problems on your page like it making your Top Page very long - which may or may not be fixable. You can also lose more spots in the module. This has been a buggy module for a long time. Some people recommend that you keep trying to add the image and/or wait for the image to miraculously appear (which may work), but I'm warning you that messing with the module too much is a risky method.    Also, please note the 360 community guidelines (http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui... ) regarding mature content. The personal profile area is a public area, which can't be changed from that status. Adult images must be placed ONLY in the blog under mature content controls. IF you have been reported for adult images in that module or in the 360 background, then Yahoo could have removed those images. This inadvertently could have resulted in those spots being lost as well.      NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it prepares to migrate parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet.   - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.   - See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for more information on 360 glitches.   - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... .

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	How to fight spam and scams:     1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.    You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.    Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:  http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...     2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails. Forward spam to: spam@uce.gov, in the subject line enter something like "unsubscribe link results in more spam", "unwanted spam message", "no unsubscribe link" or something similar.    When the FTC gets your mail, they will look into the matter and when they find out who the spamming source is, they will take legal actions.     http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp...     3: Check Mailwasher, it helps to eliminate spam from your inbox...    Set up your email account(s) in MailWasher and hit the "Check Mail" button. It then downloads all new message headers and displays message details alongside each one (priority, subject, from, to, etc.). Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.    Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.    MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness. You can have email addressed to "undisclosed recipients" automatically deleted and bounced for example.    Note: the program is free but limited to one email account. MW Pro supports multiple mail accounts.    http://www.mailwasher.net/|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	There has been a huge increase in spam lately.  I have started to use a free programme Mail Washer rated 5 out of 5 by consumeractive magazine. It's worth a try to see if it helps you. It's not perfect but it certainly helps me. Download from http://www.mailwasher.net/

6LOvxLL5aa	Freecycle is a group of people in your area that list anything they have that is no longer needed or wanted. When you subscribe to the group you have access to whatever item they have listed. If interested you send a reply to them letting them know. If you are chosen, you then set up a day and time to pick up the item(s). Everything is completely free. It is a great way to get rid of things that you no longer have any use for and make great friends in the process. If you post items to be given same goes. They contact you and so forth.

c701e5c81d7445bdaf7c9f86b930b3a1aa	Its called Yahoo! MessEnger, Windows Live/MSN MessEnger, or AIM.    They are all free.      Yahoo! and Windows Live you can send text messages to phones at no charge to you, but it may charge the person who gets it IF they dont have texting on their phone plan.    I dont know about AIM and texting phones.

LtrCbddwaa	Yes, StoryMash is for real, tho you wont get rich until you happen to already have a huge following.  Most are earning only $5 a month. If money is your primary concern, then SM is not for you, but if you love reading and writing great stories, it's a ton of fun!|`|AevtOtzPaa	Most likely scam. Simply put, anything that is too good to be true is false.|`|g2Y9xui0aa	No dont waste time on story mash. There's no proof that it pays. I recommend you to try concentrating on survey sites that pays you. I'm earning on doing surveys and giving my opinions to the websites they show. Also i earn about $50-$100 a month.

QU37MZi7aa	i don't understand what you mean "lunch box" of yahoo messenger. if it won't open, try to restart your computer and click again to open the messenger for sign in. if problem persists, then the installation was not completely done or your messenger is corrupt. check it again esp the connection also.
e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	It doesn't work with Yahoo Mail Classic or New Yahoo Mail.    Mail plus is needed for pop forwarding to use with outlook and other mail progs which have the read receipt option, but it costs 19.99$ a year for US accounts (free for UK accounts).     Note: even when using mail plus or any of the other mail progs, you do not have the guaranty that you get a read receipt because a recipient can opt out of sending such notices. Reason behind this: by denying a read receipt, you make sure that spammers don't know whether they hit a real mail address.

It is a package deal with all of your other yahoo accounts (360, IM, YQA, email, etc... ).  Hope this helps!!!
OHs8yJiOaa	If the Virgin Mobile account is under her name and she's the one with the password for it, you're not going to be able to cut it off.    If it's getting automatically charged to your credit card or bank account, you can contact them and inform them to refuse any charges from Virgin Mobile.    Otherwise, it's a pay as you go phone, so she has to add fresh funds to it herself at least every three months or it will expire. If she wasn't carrying a balance on it, it could run out even faster than that. You can stop the funds coming from you, but you can't stop a pay as you go phone if someone else keeps paying for it.    Ultimately, you can stop paying for the phone yourself, but if it's her account and she pays every three months to keep it active, you can't cut it off any more than you can cut off anyone else's cell phone service and cell phone account.|`|QU37MZi7aa	go to the provider/carrier where you are paying the phone bill and tell them to cut off the service of the phone she is using. that's too simple.

97ffb82b060bf7e0520831377f161ebcaa	I'm not sure whats wrong with people. As if it really matters if your in the right catagory, no ones gonna die, and no ones life is going to be affected by it. If you read some of the outrageous questions that are pervy and gross, and they don't get reported for it, then no one obviously has a real sense of what is acceptable and what isn't.  I just think sometimes people have a power control issue, and they get a false sense of power by reporting people on a website because they are obviosly too lame to do it in reality. So basically, i would just ignore it when people start in on "abuse", becuase from what i can see, you haven't done anything wrong. Just tell people to get off their computer for once, and stop having a stick up their butt!|`|AA11591648	Well, that is Yahoo answers for you!

I just assumed when someone reports someone they remained anonymous because it says you do.  Maybe they're confusing you with someone else?  Try not to worry about it.

All you did was ask a question. I don't know how they felt that you were asking them personal information. Maybe you did get reported. But does that mean Yahoo tells the whole Answers Community that you were reported? I mean, if that is what happened, how else would they know? Or maybe it's just the people.

AA10197609	there are so many girls out there in the world.  is this girl really worth destroying your friendship over?  by the way, it sound a bit shallow, like you only like her looks.  just find someone else who isn't going out with one of your friends.  it may take a while, but she isn't the only girl out there.|`|AA11491159	if she dates your friend and not you then she doesnt like you enough to date you move on and like someone else|`|AA11591648	Well, you could do the bravest yet stupidest thing ever, tell him how you feel!    But it would be more sensible of you to wait and see how it works out. You know funny things happen in life, sometimes, patience is just all you need and everything comes to you!    I don't know if you will have to make your move but I reckon if you have to , then hang on a little for your best chance!    And anyway, you may ruin your friendship and find out she doesn't even like you one bit! My advise, be patient, Patience is a virtue!    Hope I helped a bit!|`|15804c9130646a9234f2bf116b9a926baa	If you're willing to lose your best friend, then date her.     But if you're better than that, and willing to sacrifice a relationship with a 'beautiful girl' that might not ever work out for a friendship that will probably last a lifetime, then don't date her.     It's all up to you.|`|e539dd585e16c89d76c7a8e5f65f3246aa	If this guy you say is your "best friend" then really she's completly off limits until they break up and you have a serious talk with your buddy. I mean afterall "bros before hoes" and I think your friend will be around longer than a girl.  And also it might be against her morals to date a ex's friend's. If your friend is O.K. with it and there seems not be a jealous factor, she's O.K. with it, and you won't feel guilty about it later then you should at least give it a try. But dont try to bring her around him, that would be disrespectful.

AA11070502	I give them the same answer that my parents gave me; "Read the assignment, the answer is in there." Nine times out of ten it was. Yes, school is out but some kids are in summer school and I am sure that the teachers are always available to assist with problems. They were when I went to school.  For all the people who endorse kids getting their homework done on line, I hope that you will be just as understanding in line at a store or fast food restaurant when the computers go down and that poor kid can't give you the correct change.|`|5e0039406d64b392a07df02cf5947b3daa	Because they wanna grow up and be stupid and lazy by letting other people always solve their problems|`|AA11501486	O.K. I'm not sure if you are aware of it, school is out. Maybe the kid just wanted to know. What ever it is why is of a concern to you? I don't mean to be rude, but if the kid is sitting on the computer asking strangers for help with his homework instead of his parents...maybe the problem isn't the people on here that are trying to help but the break down in his own family. When you went to school did you get A's all by yourself.If you did good for you, if not you probably asked Mom or Dad.Many kids today are by themselves after school or during the summer days. Give them a break..how about the fact that this kid asked for help with school work and not how to score with a girl. Give the kid a break and lightened up. there are huge issues with this world and your worried if someone helped a kid with an educational problem.|`|AA12200158	maybe you need homework help. its allowed, not aloud! at least these kids are learning so that they dont make grammer mistakes when they are older. ?|`|AA12223930	most kids just dont care if they cheat anymore. it will catch up with them after high school when they realize they dont know **** but that cute chick they cheated off of is a CEO|`|AA10220675	Sometimes the answerer's don't tell the truth and maybe the "kids" were teenagers pretending.|`|AA11591648	It is not called cheating. It is just making a research and ask for help! And what about when adults ask about sex in the Family and relationships category, shouldn't that be called infidelity? Or maybe even cheating instead of talking to their husbands and wives, so please, some married people ask questions that are unbearable, did you hear anybdy complain? No!    My points is that those kids are just looking for reference and maybe they just don't have good teachers or parents that are able to help them!     You wouldn't mind if they used Google or Wikipedia, would you? No you wouldn't!    Well, Y!A is just like google and Wiki except that the answers come from real people!    It is not cheating!

db6f6808f903a40bde29dc0e3d636c79aa	You have to ask yourself which is the greater good.  Should you protect your family OR live in peace with your neighbor or government?  The ideal would be to have both, however I believe the priority lies with protecting your family.  You also have to ask yourself which is the best way to crawl out from under occupation, there is a time for paperwork and politics, just as there is a time for aggression and war.      I feel that it is critical to balance your immediate desires with your future desires.  Do you think it is more valuable for your children (assuming you have kids now or will in the future) to strap explosives to their bodies to kill a handful of the enemy or would you rather raise them to be self respecting and wise and see them use their intellect to eventually squeeze the occupiers out of your country in the future?  There is a time and a place for war, but few sides truly prevail when it comes down to it.  That having been said I definitely believe there is a time when negotiation fails and swords must be drawn.      You also must ask yourself WHO is saying your actions are the actions of terrorists.  Political dissent has always existed in the United States, genuine dissent is healthy and what keeps officials in check, however few people possess the will and intelligence to preserve our nation's future.  If left to the pacifists or liberals we would be speaking German right now from World War II.      Yours is not an easy question, and I don't think you will ever be able to find an answer.

323b7d936476b2c932be584b6382b085aa	Le principe est simple. Pour viter de poser trop de questions.  Plus tu rponds, plus tu peux poser de questions.

c81f67ea390ccefd22165eecdb337d1aaa	Ce n'est pas dit que la rponse fournie en premier est la plus exacte et la plus complte, ou n'est peut-tre pas tout simplement la rponse attendue (?a dpend des questions), donc il est bon de laisser la possibilit aux gens de donner leur point de vue, mme si quelqu'un l'a dj fait auparavant.  D'autre part, ?a permet  celui qui a pos la question de se faire sa propre rponse. Et puis, ?a fait plaisir d'avoir plusieurs avis.  Combien de rponses attends tu pour ta question? Je suis sympa, je t'en fourni une supplmentaire.  Bonne journe.|`|aafe232de3be1bd5349711bcaf1af999aa	Peut etre dans l'espoir d'avoir de meilleures rponses.|`|AA11591648	c'est tout simplement une bug dans Yahoo

Je pense que tout comme le paradis, c'est un moyen de se rassurer et de se dire qu'il y a quelquechose aprs la mort. Sauf que contrairement   l'image du bien heureux au paradis, on s'immagine plut?t les fant?mes comme des ames en peine ou protgeant les tres aims.
