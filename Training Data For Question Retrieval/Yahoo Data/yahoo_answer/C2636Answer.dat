They'll give you dealer trade-in pricing.  You have to take it to them and they will appraise it and give you a trade price that will give them a profit when they re-sell the car (either on the lot or to another dealer).  You never get what the car is worth when trading in as the lot has to make a profit as well.

	Headers take more metal. They are not cheaper to produce.    They barely provide any extra power. Which has been dyno proven thousands of times.    Also, most times than not, the exhaust manifold is about as efficient as it can get. You can change the sound of the engine with headers, but that's about it.    Plus, why bother installing a multiple-pipe header, when a simple manifold will do the job?    You could just as well say every car should come with a ram-air hood. Just as useless.|`|	Agree with the above, plus there are heat considerations - a cast manifold doesn't radiate heat like a header can.  All a header is is a tubular manifold anyway... plus any flow characteristics are already impeded by a stock exhaust system which trades silence for flow.  Trucks are luxury cars these days after all.
02mCOpVOaa	Go to a specialist, people who tint cars for a living.  They'll give the answer you looking for.    Although, i think you can do it. Just search for the right tint screen.|`|AA11275863	Get ready to pay for tickets, in most states, if you do. The rear glass is darker than the front windows are legally allowed to be.
AA11264416	i wouldn't think so because a sound violation would be an ordinance ticket, ordinance tickets don't put points, but if you get pulled over the cop might check your exhaust, very unlikely but its a chance and if you have no cats then its illegal, not sure what he'd do if you don't have cats, maybe a "fix it" type ticket but not to sure, but i bet the camaro sounds bad a**, i looked at a 95 Z28 awhile back i was thinking about buying and it had to of been the loudest exhaust you could get, sounded like a nascar, didn't get the car though, i already get in enough trouble in my 98 chevy silverado 4x4 5.7L 350 lol|`|0Wvyh3EBaa	usually it is not a moving violation due to  the noise  not reflecting your driving behavior.

ywPADGDNaa	Don't know if your civic is Manual or Auto but you will get around 11,000 trade in for your civic. Depending on all that though. here is the site http://www.edmunds.com/used/2007/honda/c... try KBB.com they get more in depth. I just bought a used 2007 SI with 19k on the clock and payed 16,000. I talked them down from 21,000 since used cars have so much mark up on it. If I were in your position depending if you own it and your in no rush to get a SI. I would try to sell it private you will get about 2 grand more, just post on craigslist and maybe auto trader if you want to pay to post. But after about a month or so if you do not have any luck with that just trade it in. But stay firm with the trade in value because dealers will low ball your vehicle and drop the price on the car to make it seem like your getting a deal but in the end they win because they turn around and sell your trade for more money. So the money saved was really money lost, if that makes sense. I sell cars so I know. But just shop around and be patient trust me I spent a month finding my Civic and it worked out great because I ended up getting mine in perfect condition with clean car fax at trade in value. Oh and the Civic SI is very reliable I know a lot of people that have them so no worries. Good choice in car.|`|OCMrQVRxaa	keep ur it will b moor reliabil than the si

p9ZrhJBqaa	we are talking a bicycle right if the pedals are grinding from a crash more than likely he bent the pedal crank which can be replaced easy remove one or both pedals their are two nuts holding the crank to the center housing remove both  and replace with new crank reinstall  nuts and pedals if gears are grinding they are out of adjustment on the rear wheel is the gear shifter in the gear shifter housing is a Allen screw or two one is for the low gears the other is the high gears flip the bike upside down adjust Allen screws as you pedal the bike   until the gears shift smoothly as for the brake their are only4 things that can be wrong for it not to work 1 is broken cable 2 broken brake lever 3 broken or worn out brake pads 4 broken brake pad holder if the cables are broken buy new cables if the pad are worn out replace them most big stores like Fred Meyers have bike sections and sell brake pads  and cables any will do unlike cars bikes are not specific if the pads are good and the cables are not broken maybe you need to adjust them even bike brake pads wear and need adjusting   easy grab both pads and press against the wheels where the cable enters the brake pad holder loosen the nut there and take a pair of pliers and pull the cable tight then release the pad about a 1 quarter of an inch and re tighten the nut for the cable and your brake should  engage within that quarter of an  inch.  otherwise try finding a bike repair shop its cheaper to do it your self.  also you can try to ask the manufacture of the bike for a parts or installation   instructions or assembly instructions most will proved you one free of charge , that will give you the step by step installation guide for every part on the bike..  hope this helps   LR|`|s5XBUsQRaa	go buy a new bike|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	Well given the VERY limited explanation you gave...    I'd say your grinding in the pedal issue is probably the bearings or races are going out, both easy and cheap to replace.    As for the brakes, well, there's only SO MUCH that comprises the braking system on a bicycle, just look at it and see what's broken.
23JqybDCaa	Depends on the company sponsoring you.    If it's a small, no-name window tint company, then yeah, just wear their shirts and go to car shows.    If you get sponsored by a big name racing company, then you'll have to practice, race, and win.  They will install the parts for free.  After you race a few times, the parts won't be worth anything to them.  So yeah, you can probably keep them.  Depends on the contract.    HOWEVER...  If you sign with a big racing company, you will be under contract.  If you start losing races, they will drop you.  Also, they will try to keep your car.  They'll say something like, "Over 50% of the car has parts that we put on it. So technically, the car belongs to us."  Then next weekend you'll see someone else driving your car.    The key to getting sponsored is to have an education about racing.  Go to defensive driving school, get a certificate.  Go to racing school, get a diploma.  Go to races, win races.    Nobody will sign you just because you have a nice car.  There are lots of nice cars out there.  You have to stand out from the rest.  You have to make people want what you have.    Good luck!  Maybe we'll see you on TV one day.|`|OgvkF5mvaa	u can get discount depending how big the place is u can get free stuff like shirts and stuff like that if its sumthing huge like greddy and turbonetics they modd ur car and u have to take it to contest and shows stuff like that and if u win 1st place u keep like 75% of the check not a bad deal if u ask me

At the same time, there's no way your fuel economy could be cut in half without some other symptom from the engine.      The warning lights are supposed to light up when you turn the key to "on" before starting -- does the "check engine" light illuminate then?  Does it ever come on while driving?    Have you notice a deterioration in your engine's performance?  Does it always start immediately (cold and warm), idle smoothly, accelerate and cruise without any complaints?    Is there any chance you've been driving around with the emergency brake on?    Why do you say "some has gone down?"  Is it from looking at the gauge?  Does it happen every night?  Do you by any chance park on an incline?

Did you drop the transmission and look at it?  I doubt it's easily visible otherwise.    Honda had a big problem with the torque converters in Accords in recent years, and yours is probably included.  It's something you could replace yourself if you have a lot of technical experience.  But if the car is a daily driver, I would recommend calling your local dealership.  Honda used to replace them for little to no cost to the owners - maybe your dealership will be feeling generous.

c3e47027bea44693f335220367a34ee2aa	Go to a dealer.  Airbags are very tricky to replace.  If a small static charge fires, it can cause an airbag to explode.    The technicians at the dealer know how to replace them and what is needed.  ( as to whether a computer is needed also ).  Body shops often used parts from previously wrecked vehicles.    I would want my van fixed properly, that is why I would go to a dealer.  It would be my butt behind the wheel if an airbag is needed in a future crash.

Nx0KZfoCaa	right...easy one first.  Punto rear wipers run off the same pump as the front ones.  Usually if the pump is running but there's no water it can be one of 4 things.  1. empty washer bottle  2. blocked washer nozzles  3. blocked/knackered one-way valve  4. pipe come loose.    1 and 2 are obvious. 3 is in the engine bay...follow the tubing until u find it...they have a hole in the top.  water coming from that hole means a clogged/dead valve.  4 is usually a piece of pipe in the bootlid.  Open the boot and remove the plastic trim from the inside of the lid.  The piping there has a connector that commonly comes loose.    Ok...starting problem.    If the battery isn't charging at all then the battery is faulty.  Make sure all the car's electrics are off and put the battery on a trickle charge if possible....leave it for an hour or so and try it then.  If the car is turning over but not firing the problem is either fuel or spark.  If the starter motor clicks or whirrs then that's the problem.  Punto's do have a tendancy to seize starter motors.    Try my sources for more help.|`|ampkZtrXaa	Seriously, always avoid a FIAT. My honest advice is, get rid as soon as you can!|`|a485249c3bac339c7f0182433bb64119aa	1. Does the battery have any life in it at all?  If the answer is NO, then the battery itself is suspect, since a new battery should not lose all its charge in two months, unless something has been draining it, like a light left on for instance.  2. Charging time depends very much on the charger being used. A typical home charger [up to 5 or 6 amp] should charge a relatively small battery like the Punto's overnight. The charge rate should initially be fairly high, near the limit of the charger, and decline steadily as the battery stores charge. Is it known that the charger is working properly?  3. Try starting the car with a booster battery connected by jump leads; preferably fitted to another car which has its engine running while trying. Connect + to + first, then - to - , connecting to the Punto battery last. DO NOT CONNECT + TO - !!    Rear screen washer:  I am unfamiliar with the Punto but would expect the rear washer to use a different pump from the front one. Knowing the quality of Fiat electrics I would expect an electrical fault first, but it may not be. Can you hear the pump running when you try to use it? If you can, then clearly this is not the problem.    I hope something here helps you - good luck!

V8 in a Japanese SUV.    So, regardless of what you try to do with it, the stereotype is going to fit. You chose poorly.    And that "respect" you think you're getting, is only because your vehicle is stupidly large.  Other than that, there's nothing particularly unique, interesting, or otherwise respectable about it. It's bland. No different than any other SUV I see going down the road.    It's a soccer mom-mobile, plain and simple.    Want to look manly? Get a jeep. Take it off road, put some mud, dirt, and dents on it. Don't ask for options. Toss the CD player, leather seats, and all that gay crap. Don't keep it super clean. Treat it like a utility vehicle, like it's designed to be.    I wonder, if you've even taken the Armada offroad....    Bottom line: Manly men get dirty, work hard, and are rough.

skfHV92caa	What usually happens on those cars is the inner tie rod bushings wear out at the rack and pinion that causes this vibration.  Most people will tell you that you need to replace the inner tie rods, but you can purchase these quick bushings (from Oreilly's Auto Parts) that are easily installed without having to be pressed in.  With these bushings, you unbolt the inner tie rod from the rack (23MM bolt), remove the old bushing, install the new one, and bolt back in.  You will not have to have an alignment afterwards.  But if you replace the inner tie rod, be prepared to have an alignment down afterwards.  Hope this helps.  BTW, check to see if you have play in the steering wheel.|`|dQUISy3Haa	First balance the wheels and have the suspension checked.|`|DV4xyeChaa	first balance wheels...|`|5427036efac063a7732d113e0750bf0faa	At those speeds, it could be a tire/wheel or suspension problem. The inner tie rods would usually start shaking at about 20 mph and never quit until you got back below that speed. If the vibration goes away and then comes back at different speeds, that's usually a sign of a tire problem.    To check the inner tie rods is free and easy if you have a floor jack. Jack up one of the front wheels, and try turning (as in steering, not spinning) the wheels by hand. As you're doing this, watch the inner tie rods to see if they move around on the bolt that holds them to the rack. You could use the vehicle jack, but it isn't nearly as safe as a floor jack, so be careful if you try that. -- And always use jackstands if any part of your body might be under any part of the vehicle while on a jack.    If they move around, you need new inner tie rods or bushings. I personally prefer to replace the entire inner tie rod rather than just the bushings, but if I was going to replace just the bushings, I would use the Chrysler bushings that require pressing in. I would not use the aftermarket bushing kits that don't require pressing, I just don't trust them. Anytime the aftermarket makes something like that as a DIY thing, it just doesn't last as long as the correct replacement parts. Plus, it's a steering related part, so a little extra cost is well worth the knowledge that it's done correctly.     It will require an alignment after replacing the tie rod ends, and is advisable to get it aligned even if just replacing the bushings.     If the inner tie rods check out OK, then first get the tires balanced. If that doesn't fix the problem, then have the rest of the suspension checked out.
bB5ZPtvvaa	You are running perhaps 335hp at the crank,  not at the wheels,  and the 6 series is a relatively heavy car.  Stock modifications (intake, perofrmance chip and performance exhaust may provide a gain of 10 or 12% over stock - but again at the crank and little of that will be transmitted to the wheels.    Quite frankly this BMW like most BMW's requires forced induction to power up to a decent performance level.    A mild boost supercharger,  as a bolt on installation is available and has been specifically designed to run with stock engine components.  http://www.vf-engineering.com/index.php?...    this installation at 6p.s.i. will provide a gain over stock of approximately 40% in the range of 140hp....much of that will reach the wheels making this car the contender it should be.    Of course its not cheap-but power is expensive,  pay a little get a little or non-noticeable gain.    For the BMW in a lower boost installation a supercharger is always better than a turbo:  -makes the same power for equivalent level of boost  -lighter and runs cooler  -easier and generally cheaper to install  -delivers power earlier and in a more linear fashion.    regards|`|43DHFQnKaa	Your car like most BMW's is relatively slow from both the get-go and a "running start".    The only way you are going to enjoy real performance from this car is a supercharger or turbo charger (likely supercharger will be cheapest and best option).    Adding other mods like exhaust, intake will gain you little and if you open up the engine to do race cams or built out bottom end (pistons rods) you will end up at the same cost as a supercharger - less power.    cheers,  "m eater"|`|mZcClQthaa	6-Series tuning tips from the car tuning guide, we take a look at the best power mods for the 6-Series in our latest guide.    Available in standard form in the guise of the 6-Series 5.0 V10 Convertible SMG with power of upto 499bhp depending on the year, so this goes to show the tuning potential of the 6-Series 650i Sport .    From this you can increase the power from anywhere between 548.9bhp to 748.5bhp with mods ranging from a few subtle add ons to a full engine rebuild! And more in the case of most Turbo engines if you include an uprated turbo.    The lower powered 6-Series owners should think about an engine swap with the engine from the 499bhp 6-Series 5.0 V10 Convertible SMG. There is a handy guide on engine swaps on TorqueCarsAlready a popular choice for tuning up, especially the more powerful 6-Series. The most frequent modification we see on the 6-Series include sports exhausts, air intakes or induction kits and a fuel pressure boost valve.    The Car Reference CarRef guide recommend that on the 6-Seriess , you get a fast road cam. Internal engine modifications that should be high up on your list would be polishing and porting the head. Its also worth reading this guide on Porting and Polishing    The 6-Series comes in various power levels right up to 362bhp as per the 6-Series Convertible If you apply a few tuning mods to this model of 6-Series you will see power gains from anywhere between 398.2bhp to 506.8bhp. Any more than this and you will start to see unreliability appearing.    BMW put together a nice package but the turbo 6-Series owners have a real tuners dream. A remap and Intercooler will add a lot of power to the engine and in some cases you can double your power. The 6-Series has a healthy 362 bhp. On a turbo engine you can further increase the power from anywhere between 470.6 bhp to 687.8bhp with mods we have outlined above. Suspension improvements can dramatically increase the road holding and cornering of your 6-Series 650i Sport . To avoid other problems you should lower the car no more than 36mm.|`|b1ZQxbgxaa	Critics, on balance, report that the 6-Series' engine is powerful and smooth, and that its steering, suspension and braking systems work together to create a car that handles well -- for a sporty cruiser.|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	I'd would go to AC Schnitzer and have them give me mods.

AA10331789	Your lucky! The Gates website shows your model as not having an "interference" type engine that is damaged if your timing belt breaks. So once you make sure of that, you can just keep driving until the timing belt breaks.

My Grand Prix does the same thing every time there is an ice storm. On GM vehicles there is a metal piece about 3/8thx3/4th inch in size that is mounted on the wiper assembly that is supposed to move and is spring loaded. It is what catches on the tab to activate the spring loaded park mechanism. When the metal piece is frozen from rain freezing or lack of lubrication, it does not catch on the tab to park the blades and when the motor shuts off they will be in the upright position. I've sprayed mine down with penetrating oil and worked the metal piece back and forth until it was free again. Coat the complete metal piece with a light grease and if you are lucky it won't happen again for a couple of years. You will need to remove the wiper arms, the cowl under the arms and the plastic cover on the top of the wiper assembly to gain access to the metal piece which is frozen. Sometimes the tab needs to be repositioned if it was bent. Any dealer mechanic will probably be aware of this design flaw. You don't need to buy anything, just pay 1 to 1.5 hours labor.|`|Op8JYvlhaa	let your b/f take the car to the a dealership the sells that type of car, and they can tell you for sure.

I think with that small amount of gasoline it should be ok.  I would not take to dealer because it would void your warranty.|`|	That was a dumb move.....|`|	I'm not sure how much 73 pence or 17 pounds worth of diesel or gasoline is. (Sorry American computer keyboard, don't have the pound sign)    But guessing by the ratio of pence to pound, I'd say you'll be alright. A little petrol in the diesel won't cause any major damage. Just top off the tank as soon as you've used a few litres, and again when you've used a few more and that will dilute it faster.     As long as you don't make a habit of it, you shouldn't have a problem.
Bl9zcqxQaa	Not sure what sort of car you own, but some GM models have a pretty in-depth way of "clocking" the wipers.   You will need a repair manual to do it properly,   I have been working on them for 23 yrs, they still are hard to get clocked properly.   You nay want to just pay a technician to do it right.   Its not a bad motor, switch , etc, it just needs to be clocked on the wiper motor and your problem will be solved.  The most common vehicles are usually the montana, transports , grand prix, regals, etc.    Good luck|`|a8m3HdDHaa	Unbolt the crank from the motor turn it 180 degrees and bolt it back on.

That means you'll need safety jack stands or a professional vehicle lift to support the car when you take the wheels off. You also need wheel chocks to keep the car from rolling off the jack stands. If you don't want to do the job right, I advise you not to do it at all because once an accident happens it's too late.    http://www.extremehowto.com/xh/article.a...|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	What kind of car?

Then on the calipers you will see 2 bolts that are the same size and another 2 bolts that are the same size. The 2 bolts that are smaller and have a rubber dust cover around it is the ones you should open. Once you open them, the pads can easily be removed without taking the whole caliper of the spindle.|`|X2ED3OrRaa	You need to state what you are trying to take the caliper off.  Car, truck,lawn tractor,go cart, scooter..........................                 "BRILLIANT"!!!!|`|l2m6Zzhqaa	Best bet is go to an auto parts store (where you bought the brake pads would work) and buy the Chilton or Haynes manual for your vehicle. It will tell you what you need to do. It will also tell you most of the safety steps you should take. But I do agree you need to use wheel chocks and jack stands.. Don't just use the jack to hold the vehicle up because they aren't made for that and it could fail on you.

Only use the proper stuff, never use engine antifreeze or liquid de-icer.  Either of the latter can cause serious damage, both to your washer system and your paintwork.  Nip down to Halfords and get a big container for very little money, mix it according to instructions or even make it a little stronger than recommended.

A vehicle  accident is an event resulting in injury or damage that is unavoidable and unpreventable, an act of God. Conversely, a vehicle mishap is an event resulting in injury or damage that is avoidable and preventable. Most vehicle collisions are mishaps.

How fast do you expect it to go!!!???<br>  <br>  A larger exhaust will help the engine breath better on high end speeds. That's why you see headers on hot rods. You can put a bigger exhaust on any bike/car, but it wont do much good until you build the engine better, in some cases it hurts to do it. Engines require a certain amount of backpressure to operate at top effeciency, (too large an exhaust wont let back pressure build up, harming fuel economy, and even possibly burning valves and pistons). Who cares about sound? It's laughable to see a learners bike desperately trying to look and sound like a big bike. Sorry, but it just is, and I've got two 125cc bikes.

But if you just leave it on a public street, then the city/county has rules about getting a tag put on it and later hauling it away.<br>  <br>  Obviously remove anything from the car that could lead them back to you.  Finally, you have the right to use your own garage - and the recycler will be happy to have the car.<br>  <br>  You can try going through legal channels, but these things are sticky.

In my experience you have trouble changing gear when they need replacing.  Maybe it is your shoes, try differently soled ones.  Another thing is noise.  On my Honda Civic, if the stereo is too loud i am much more likely to stall it.|`|56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	If the clutch was worn it would be easier for you to start from a stop. The clutch would slip. This would keep the motor from stalling. It sounds like you need a mechanic to teach you to drive stick. I've taught many people and all it takes is to relax a person, let them know they will stall the car. Then explain you need to rev the motor more while releasing the clutch pedal. When revving the motor too much you will be "riding the clutch" which is not good because it will wear the clutch out faster. But... for learning it is expected for a while. Just be aware that you need to find a balance between stalling and jerking and not releasing the pedal fast enough. If you just can't get it go automatic transmission.|`|doeg7JSaaa	Most clutches have an automatic ratchet which keeps them adjusted, it may be getting worn but you can assist by every so often putting your toes underneath the clutch pedal and left it up quite sharply as high as it will go. You should hear a click as it re-adjusts and then you will feel more bite as you press the clutch pedal down. If this solves your problem be aware you will need a new clutch ratchet eventually. But hang on because if the ratchet is dying then the whole clutch may need replacing soon and its cheaper to do al in one go. |`|UZcUIfwIaa	If the car stalls then the cluch must be engaging.

AA10613104	its still a little early for diesels to have this problem, usually it must be below freezing for this to occur. I belive your truck isnt getting good fuel to start. It is very important to regularly change the fuel filters on diesels, these separate water and condensation from the fuel. When they are clogged, it results in hard starts. I suspect this is your problem. You can also plug in your truck, and the plug usually stick out of the lower gril, under the front bumper, or if you dont see it, open the hood and see if is pushed back behind the grill. good luck.|`|5DiFNjXWaa	Yes, diesels are known for having that problem, my uncle had the same problem. Go to a mechanics shop and they will help ya out.|`|DUnx53cOaa	No, you can't plug them in but, if equipped, you should have a block heater that can be plugged in. This keeps the engine warm to aid in starting. Consult your owners manual. As far as the glowplugs, they are energized when you turn the key to the "run" position. If they are faulty you will have fits trying to start it cold. Remove them and inspect. Any signs of burning at the tips or a ohm reading over 2ohms indicates a faulty plug. Check that you have power to the plugs w/ a test light during the energize cycle. You can also check them by disconecting them, attaching the testlight clip to the positive battery connector then the probe end to the terminal of each plug. The lamp should illuminate briefly then go out. Hope I've been of some help. |`|Z6ghljeGaa	Yes, that's a common problem with diesels, the plug's i've seen are a normal outlet plug that comes out of the grill,  If it was coiled up in there you would probably already know about it.  There may be another plug in that area for that type of plug to plug into.  <br>  <br>  Wow, I said plug alot.  <br>  <br>  Any way, a dealer ship would probably be able to explain this better and install one for you if you don't already have it.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if you bought the truck new but if it already has it it would say something like "cold weather package" on the invoice. 
fbxqLErlaa	In my mind there is only one way to answer the question.  Fire up your machine and head out into the snow.    I think it will be a blast.    I road my dirt bikes in the snow many years ago.  Total fun!!  If you get stuck, just start digging.  Good Luck and Have Fun!|`|u0PHhZOSaa	as long as you have good tires. wooly booger work awesome in deep snow on my 300ex and blasters let some pressure out of the tires so it grips more. alway keep the revs up too and park in packed areas.|`|Rb8vURwmaa	just make sure you don't go in sand with snow on it. i did it with my blaster and my 300ex and both got stuck. its amazing how snow and sand put together can suck up your tires.|`|Brc1Z54iaa	Mine did ok in about 5 to 6 inches.

I7NkFJo2aa	You can't broach going up the back of a wave under power unless you go too quick and fall over the front, and setting your boat on the back of a wave and going along at it's speed is pretty safe, the safest way to cross a bar entrance.  The safest speed downwind in storm conditions is one quarter the wave speed to avoid broaching.  Or better yet don't be out in storm conditions.....|`|AA10562288	You will NOT lose steerage way ......|`|U24VtSlZaa	nope, you'll maintain full control throughout.|`|AA11403649	no|`|EooU3QGnaa	A wave is a condition, not a position. Your possition is actually moving thru the water at the same rate the water is being condition to form a wave. So your steering is going to be effective till you crest the wave condition- which will remove your rudder/sterndrive from the water and start the breach process. Once back skieing down the face of the wave you can throttle up, and increase your speed thru the water to regain steerage and rescue the broach process.

myxbTq1laa	There are a number of things this could be.<br>  <br>  What kind of amp exactly?  2 channel? 4 channel? Is it bridgeable?<br>  <br>  1.  Do you have a crossover setting or crossovers on these at all?  If you are sending full range sound into the speakers, you are wasting current.  They should still make some good noise though.  You could by a cheap crossover resistor to put on the speakers, but most good amps will have this build in.  Make sure it is set to at most 120hz and below.  Good low bass is 80hz and lower.<br>  <br>  2.  You should go to a good car audio shop and have them help you with the wiring of the subs....bridging them will get you more power out of an amp that is built for 2 ohm loads.  I am not sure how to wire 4 subs into 2 wires.  My guess would be (4) 8 ohm speakers, bridged in a very particular manner will get your a 2 ohm load at the speaker inputs ( 2 channel amp).  I do remember wiring up (2) 8 ohm 12's to get 2 ohms, but I would seek an expert on this delicate wiring as you can blow your amp or subs pretty easily.<br>  <br>  3.  Check your power source - you will need a good amount of juice, 20A - 40A fuse - with a good size power wire (not sure exactly since I dont know your amp)  6 awg or 8 awg minmum and good ground to the car.<br>  <br>  4.  If you are wiring a 4 channel amp - 1 channel to each - definitely check your + and - and be consistent.  If your amp is bridgeable, you can get nearly 2x the power out of the amp in bridged mode.  Look up how to do this, but again you must have the right ohm speakers to do this and the right wiring configuration.<br>  <br>  5.  Check the gain of your amp - highest isn't always best.  Start by turning your gain all the way down on your amp.  Then max out your other speakers with the subs off.  Then slowly turn up the gain until your subs get slight distortion then turn them down.  This way you will not over power your subs and cause damage.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA12095518	you probably have them out of phase.  try switching the positive and negative wires on one of the subs and it should fix the problem.|`|YkMgGYt2aa	well 1000 watt is not that much...how many channels is it...if it is a four channel you still are drawing alot of power from the amp for 4 subs...i have 2 12 and i use a 2000 watt amp just for those 2 and i rattle the windows of cars behind mine...i would say u need a better amp and maybe try to get a cap to help hold some power....you can also try to bridge 2 subs and 2 subs together that might help|`|KfP7CIFqaa	it could be the amp cuz i had two 12 mtx's installed in my crx and it had some sound comming out of them but didnt hit hard and mym amp was shot...or it could be that your battery doesnt have enough juice to power them...good luck
5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	For a long time now, cars have had Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) systems installed as required by law I think. This is a way to use a portion of the vacuum in the intake manifold to suck a small amount of air from the crankcase through a spring loaded check valve, also called a PCV valve. The has to be a way for air to enter the crankcase, so they put a filtered vent into the crankcase, usually a valve cover. The "air breather" is the place the air enters the crankcase which prevents the crankcase from operating in a vacuum. In my 1968 Ford F-250, the breather is in the valve cover and is removable as this is also where you add oil. The filter is a coarse metal filter and never needs to be replaced, but could use cleaning with something like kerosene occasionally.My 1971 VW microbus takes air from the air cleaner through a connection downstream of the filter but before the entrance to the carburetor, so my VW does NOT have a breather like my 68 pickemup truck does.<br>  <br>  Edit: with this question in the "cars and transportation" topic, I am totally amazed that 6 answers before me misinterpreted the question and referred to animals and rockets.,..|`|EPOwJogRaa	any organism that respires using oxygen|`|hGGZZOYEaa	they allow the crankcase to relieve air psi |`|peW4sRXzaa	pretty much any living thhing that lives on the surface|`|5QvUa6Rkaa	Air Breather Is Thing That Is Not Under Water, Like You|`|MeOOUhHkaa	Things that breath air....|`|XEKvJzGaaa	Air breather is a term applied to engines that require outside air in order for their fuel to burn; most cars, airplanes, jets, small engines are some examples. A rocket engine is not an air breather. It carries it's own oxidizer (liquid oxygen) and has no need for external air. That's why they can operate in the vacuum of space.

And with all that is happening with the banking problems, getting a lien will be extremely difficult.  The more you put down on a vehicle, the less the loan will be and more than likely, the better chance you have of actually getting a loan.  Sure, dealerships want to sell their vehicles, especially their 08's because the 09's are being released.  But if the dealer can't get you financed, you won't get the vehicle.   Chances are your interest rates will be high.  The best way to get the best deal is let the dealer run your credit and see.  Get the bottom line of what they will sell you the vehicle for, get the interest rate they are charging, then work out a deal based on the cost of the vehicle, not on the payments!!  If approved for a loan, don't let them talk you into a payment, like you can afford 600.00 a month, because they will probably add in other things like a warranty and things you may not want.  Go by the actual bottom line of the vehicle period, then work out the payments.  Too many people buy into a payment and end up getting all sorts of stuff they don't want.  Buy the vehicle, not the payments.

Stay away from the Sears discount line and all of the no name discount tools.  MAC and Snap-On tools are true professional grade and you will pay for it up front but unless you tend to lose your tools, if you use them continuously and professionally they are worth it.  My favorite brand is Snap-On, simply because I believe they are the most comfortable to use, and when they are in your hands for hours every day that is a factor to consider.  However I still own and regularly use most of my 30+ year old Craftsman hand tools which were my initial professional tool set. |`|UZcUIfwIaa	You can't go far wrong with Halfords Professional.Damn sight cheaper than  the so called professionals like Snap On......|`|946109a893be7ef89b872c04100dd058aa	Craftsman, Snap-on.

Other than that, it's reputed to be reliable (thank goodness, working on Japanese cars is not a piece of cake) and gets good mileage considering it's lack of aerodynamics. Styling is subjective, but I guess it's a decent enough looking vehicle on the outside, but I don't like the interior one bit.    Lastly, Hondas are in my opinion way overpriced.

In Wisconsin, claims are to be made within 30 days of submitting the claim. This keeps insurance companies from holding your money for undetermined amounts of time. The longer they have it in the acct. the more interest they make. Check with the adjuster. They are the ones who cut the check. The claims specialist will just give you the run around.

891a1cd6411678e9a078da781ea37a4eaa	because its fun to drive fast and even if they only went 70 people could make them go faster|`|9740e5e8ead5b37471166c9abd4dfaa7aa	Not all places have specific speed limits. It would be next to impossible to have all roads in North America have the same speed limit. Driver training and respect for the law is what keeps our roads from looking like a scene from "The Road Warrior"|`|AA11021321	Even though in most places you cannot drive faster than 70 mph, there are rare circumstances where you would need to extra speed to evade a colllsion or something else.  If you're approaching an intersection and you notice something too late to stop, you could mash the gas and speed out of the situation.  Sometimes acceleration is the only way out of an emergency.|`|b0a84ec2997847ca3437776f040439b3aa	ok to add on what everybody else has said, a car that goes 70 on a clear day will need more power on a windy day as wind= more resistance also when going 70 on a freeway and ya reach a steep incline the extra power is needed to maintain the speed. another thing is that if cars were only made to go 70 then it would take awhile to reach 70 as thats all the power the car has to offer kinda like when i was younger and stupider and found out how fast my car was. the 0 to 80-85 was quick but the 85-130 was alot slower to reach as this was top speed and 100% power was needed to reach that speed|`|AA10346371	Because that's what people want.    If they made a car that would only go 70 MPH, nobody would buy it.  The company would lose money.     The same thing goes for motorcycles, ATVs, snowmobiles, jet skis, etc.    People want them to be fast and powerful.    Even the hybrid vehicles are getting powerful and fast, at the cost of fuel efficiency  Kind of defeats the point.

AkrMMcRIaa	Te recomiendo el Mazda, yo tengo uno y estoy muy contento con mi decisin. Ambos carros son buenos, las 2 compa?as ofrecen muy buena calidad, los servicios, garantas, etc. la diferencia estriba en el perfil de los autos, el Mazda es ms deportivo que el Toyota, en lo personal veo el Toyota como muy familiar o para una se?orita, en cambio el Mazda tiene una presencia distinta, su lnea es muy deportiva.    Por ello depender de ti de acuerdo a tus intereses o necesidades. El Mazda tiene ms potencia y tiene una suspensin ms deportiva comparado con el Toyota.    Otro detalle a tomar en cuenta es el equipamiento, son detalles que marca una buena diferencia respecto al confort en el uso diario.|`|62b3cf03a0cf71f9bb54402da6e5d021aa	El Toyota es muy ahorrativo, pero con una potencia muy mala, igual la suspensin.

Corre bien en carretera, las curvas no se sienten, ahorrativo.  Lo unica diferencia que extra?o del 3 es el quemacocos y el tablero luminoso, pero el espacio interior es enorme.  Toyota no lo conozco, pero la linea no me gusta mucho.|`|rBmMVhgNaa	Cmprate el Mazda. Su linea deportiva y potencia te van a convencer.  Toyota es confiable y mas ahorrador de gasolina, pero su lnea es mas conservadora.  Yo tengo un Mazda 3 modelo 2007 y estoy muy satisfecho con el auto.|`|9Cir0urNaa	yo t recomiendo el mazda 3 se ve muy moderno, muy deportivo :)

Lo mas probable es que sean los cables de bujias o en el peor de los casos la bobina. Los sintomas son inequvocos. Comienza por cambiarle los cables (son mas econmicos y puede ser que ah termine tu problema, de hecho debes cambiarlos cada 20 000 kms). Si la cosa sigue igual, lamento decirte que es tu bobina y no hay mas remedio que cambiarla (la original es cara, pero te va durar a?os. La pirata te dejar tirado al poco tiempo -ojo-).    Los chevys son buenos autos, pero este es un mal que los aqueja a todos. Ni hablar.    Saludos y suerte !
1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Hola.      Ese vehiculo es en realidad un Hynday, que es una marca buena a secas. En mxico no tuvo buena aceptacin por los estandares de calidad un tanto bajos. En cuanto al costo de las refacciones y servicios de mantenimiento no son lo ms economico que digamos, ya que los comercializa Daimler Chrysler de Mxico. Por ley tienen la obligacin de tener en existencia refacciones por los siguientes 10 a?os despues de que dejan de comercializar un auto, por ello no creo que debas de preocuparte.      Pero lo que si te debe preocupar es el porque realmente se dejo de vender en Mxico.      Te recomiendo que cheques bien toda la informacin antes de que te decidas a comprar.    Saludos|`|272638dcc75fe05e5e61f2deb36c1fb7aa	yo no le tenia fe y compre uno para un asistente ya tiene 100,000 km y sigue aguantando la carrilla jejeje

M8dmeAv6aa	Have you been to a Ford dealer? They can tell by the date of manufacture (DOM).|`|k55p1pKraa	Sorry to have to be the one to tell you it again , but your going to have to pull the tranny to see which clutch you have, the reason is they used both of the clutch on those trucks and they didn't keep record of the ones that has the 10" or the ones that have the 11" on them, You should be able to have the auto  parts store order both clutches , you may have to pay for one of them before they order it.|`|jfnJKxkAaa	You can use either, ones heavier duty for towing / hauling.    use the 11" for Over 8500 Pound Gross Vehicle Weight and the   10" for less than 8500.
oMAXAQA0aa	out of balance. Something is wrong. Could be as little as a wheel weight missing. Other things can cause this as well....bent or unbalanced driveshaft, flywheel, etc. The flywheel can be damaged if the previous starter somehow screwed up some of the flywheel teeth.  Crankshafts don't normally act up all of a sudden. But if your oil level is depleting, it can be a sign of serious internal motor problems. A bent crank will cause bearings to fail and leak.   Overheating...it sounds like you might have a broken head gasket. The water could be getting into the cylinders, causing them to misfire (vibration and loss of power).|`|i2V17yi4aa	if engine was apart then engine timeing issues  most likely its missfire by fuel injector if not then engine emission control managment(egr 02 evap) missfire most likely (coiles, spark plugs, wires) egnision/fuel injector|`|WKUGB4Hoaa	Take the car up to speed (shaking) and put it in neutral i.e. coast.  If the shuddering stops the problem is in you drive train.  If the shuddering is still present turn off the engine while coasting. Hey, don't lock the steering wheel!  Shuddering stops...check out engine timing etc.  If shuddering is present with engine off, in neutral and coasting then check you wheels for out of balance condition.  Don't forget to check your drive shaft for loose "U" joint mounts or missing parts.
B6NMzKaGaa	Not the battery,if the lights work and no clicking|`|i2V17yi4aa	i would put in neutral before start. no i dont think its your bat.    loose cable, clutch or starter might be the problem|`|2ef2c0e844e19038f6a979bb78073d8daa	Sounds like the battery.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	the deepest PULL on your battery is to start it  so lights - radio - horn - are all easy tasks - and give you no real clue    and  - cold is the worst killer of batteries    other problems that contribute - the v-belt to the alternator is off track/loose    the cables are loose to the battery    no clicking sound - the solenoid that engages the starter into place  may be defective (and cheaper than replacing a starter)    sounds like mechanic time to diagnose your problems    or if you have AAA or some road service - get a jump and drive to  an auto parts store that can check your battery out for you    all the best|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	I doubt it's your battery.  Put it in neutral and then try it, if still nothing I would check your connections to make sure they are secure on the battary and also on the starter.   If the connection's  are good probably the starter went and you'll have to replace it.|`|k55p1pKraa	It sound like your natural safety switch , like up around you clutch pedal and make sure you didn't knock off the plug to the switch. It will not start if it's unplugged or if the clutch pedal isn't pushing the switch in. This is why your car isn't starting .|`|a8e2a6233935dfca14c0f016f06538c9aa	the starter or the serpentine belt fell off|`|ecEC1Idxaa	Sounds like a clutch! I had this problem in a Probe.|`|4912e24c0a8da37575e0a7d0c1180604aa	maybe a loose cable , try tighting the cable if that doesn't work take it to auto  zone they will check it for free.|`|IwTDgULpaa	your battery is fine.maybe it could be a lot of things, maybe you need tune up.this will give you easy start when you turn engine on.could be alternator or your cable on your alternator is loose.the alternator takes over the battery after you start your engine.if you start your engine take the pos neg cable and your car will still be on and alternator does this.so either you need a tune up or change alternator if not then it could be your cat converter or o2 sensor problem.90k miles is it?|`|PjzJ9QQRaa	If the lights and radio all work, it is NOT the battery.  If the battery is low, but still semi charged(ie. lights and radio working), then it will at least try to start.  And you will easily be able to hear the battery losing power and not having enough oomph to get it started.    So, it sounds most likely that it would be the starter.  It may not have gone out, but it may be that a wire has come loose.  If you can't fix it, you will have to take it to a mechanic.  It may be an easy(and cheap) fix, doesn't sound like anything too major.|`|0pX43nKAaa	The best indicator of a dead battery(w/out tools) is the headlights. Are they bright and do they dim when you try to start it? My guess is no they don't dim, thus indicating probably a starter, starter relay or neutral safety switch.|`|0qGwCA1Baa	i had the same problem you need to take your terminals off the battery and take a knife and scrape the inside of the terminals that touch the battery post and then reconnect to battery and try this if nothing,try jumping vehicle if you get started remove the positive battery cable this will tell you if it stalls out its the alternator if i recall right...|`|YAJvT2hlaa	well check the syptom, if the lights work then your in good with the battery, now if the car is not cranking over when you try to start it then it could be the belt, or the starter or the alternator, either way your constant attempt is limited to a short amount of times to try and figure it out because each time you try to crank it and it doesn't crank over it draws power from your battery and slowly kills it and i believe you said that when you try to start it ( crank it over ) it doesn't make any noise then i would take the battery out charge  it and try it again ( i only say that because thats the cheapest thing to do) but before doing that feel on you fan belt and check to see if it is loose or  tight, if its loose then thats your problem if its tight then the next step is to have the starter or alternator checked  and most likely it would be that if it isn't the previous things that i mentioned, and if its not then your ignition needs to be replaced or the wiring needs to fixed.
TwjeEn6uaa	Open your  and get a flat head screwdriver.While pulling your door handle all the way up insert the screwdriver into the latch on the door and see if you can move the latch manually.If you can push the latch until there is an opening  facing the inside of the car.Release your hand from the door handle and close.9 out of ten times this works.If it does make sure you have it greased next time you take your car into a shop.It would not hurt either by spraying it with some wd40 before you move the latch.Hope this helps.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	that,s what it is, the cold weather. mine did that here the other morning. the latch don,t work as good when it,s cold. once the car is warmed up inside then they should work better.|`|2OPaqkLcaa	Spray some lubricant such as wd-40 around the latch mechanism and then manually exercise it a bit.|`|DiW4urVeaa	a 2007 should be under warranty take it to Ford

Insurance companies have different rates in every state. One that is cheapest in one state may not be the cheapest in another. It also depends on whether you just buy the minimum liability coverage required by your state, or if you buy collision and comprehensive, which varies in cost by the type of car. Here's an article with more about it:  http://www.leaseguide.com/cheapestcarins...    .|`|AA11908567	Everyone's cheapest is going to be different, you need to do quotes on comparsion websites.|`|Su0O55W8aa	It depends what type of insurance you are wanting!

x0TnuI6daa	The first and second complaint are possibly interrelated, the cause most likely being one of your auxiliary belts (air con, power steering and/or alternator belts) either requiring adjustment, or requiring replacement from age or wear and tear.    In regards to your bonnet latch, your bonnet cable is most likely stretched, allowing too much play to be effective in lacthing/unlatching your bonnet when pulled, if you can't get it opened yourself go to a dealer or mechanic and get it fixed right the first time :)|`|94d1acf25e2af629b7eb957530024002aa	First, you got to solve the last problem of opening the bonnet in order to have access to solve the first two    The cable releasing the bonnet latch is stretched/the mechanism is worn out/damaged. Park your car in open daylight, then try to fish that latch release cable with a hook (your may need a Vehicle Mechanic)    Lubricate the new pulley belt with water while the engine is idling. monitor if the noise disappear. Rev up the engine and check if the noise (you may need a Vehicle Mechanic if the noise remains). It can be alternator bearing running dried/lack of lubricant    The squeal when you back up car (you need a Vehicle Mechanic)
