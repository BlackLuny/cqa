20090128135731AAZyPP7	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Keyboard Problems. Please help?	Hi      I've been having this typing problem off and on for about a year now. When I type an email, a letter using word and even this question, my sentences are cut short and the cursor goes back to the beginning of the sentence.      Previously, I had problems with the keys sticking. I would have to type a single letter 4 times before it displays. Also when typing an email or chat message, some of the functions will open automatically without me clicking on it. For instance, the attach button will open up on it's own, or a new email will open up on it's own.       This problem may have to do with my keyboard, or maybe my computer is being invaded? How can I fix this on my own without having to pay $99 to HP? I can't understand them, and the phone delay is frustrating.      My computer is an HP Laptop. I have windows Vista.    It's even hard typing this answer question. I keep reverting to a previous paragraph which makes it impossible to type.

If I should raise the price, about how much should I charge for those 3-page sites?  How much would you pay for them?

I understand that WMP12 has support for the h.264 codec builtin, but I don't believe that the codec itself is causing it; I think it must be some default vibrance controls or something.

What are the chances of someone hacking into my old account when I already deleted that account almost 3 months ago?      I deleted my other yahoo account almost 3 months ago. I cant remember. Today I checked and the account is still there. Not only that I see someone has been using it when I looked at the point earned this week: it said 3. It may occur that I might have got points from a thumbs up for a best answer but I hardly did get best answer so it still looks dodgy. Should I contact yahoo now or keep my eyes peeled for more activity?   I am aware yahoo permanently gets rid of your account after 90 days. It feels like 90 days idk. but the points earned this week is really concerning me.

20090128140326AAtNiBS	Computers & Internet;Security	How to get rid of Malware on Laptop.?	I have a Windows HP Pavilion Laptop and it has recently been infected with a malware or virus of some sort. Here is what it is doing to my computer.      I turn on the computer and it goes to the screen with all the icons like it normally does. However, in a matter of 5 minutes, it suddenly goes to this blue screen and then the computer shuts down and restarts itself. This process continues and continues. I don't have much time to do anything on my computer, like a virus scan or system restore, because it keeps restarting.      I was wondering if someone can help me get rid of this virus and return my computer to normal. Thanks a lot and any help is appreciated.

I have a yellow output port in the back of my computer for attaching to the Television, as well as an S-Video and a monitor port all lined up.      I connected the yellow video output port to the TV and booted the computer. It showed the start up options and coding etc. However, when it finished the "starting windows" screen, the television went black and says "Video 1" in the corner as if nothing happened.      I then attached the Monitor back to the computer, and it showed the desktop on the monitor, but still a black screen on the Television.      How do I fix this problem? I want to be able to do things on my TV, My TV doesn't have an s-video input, so I can't try that option, or else I would.

20090225075357AAFkKLE	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Unmountable Boot Volume- Tech Question?	Hi,      I had the message "Unmountable Boot Volume" when loading Windows XP.  This happened last December.      I reformatted the disk and did  a scandisk and chkdisk.  i re-installed Windows XP.      Two months later, which is February, I have the same problem.      Now I have bought a new hard drive.      My question is, can I use the original hard drive as a back up unit after formatting it.?      Does a frequent "Unmountable Boot Volume" problem mean that the whole drive is unstable, or just the boot sector (whatever that really is).      If I use it as a backup drive, and NOT boot from it (a slave drive) then should this be okay?      Or shall I throw it in the bin?      Thanks.

When want to print email text, to use it later on as an attachment to my correspondence, it comes out in very small print, that nobody would bother to read it. The Yahoo help does not have the answer to such problem and there is nobody physically to be contacted from Yahoo to establish if there is an error on my or their side. The email looks properly until I got it on paper. Also sometimes the email from others are very extended, like whole message in 2-3 lines so cannot see the end until moving along the text. And I do not know the reasons nor cure to it.
