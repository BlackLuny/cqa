First, it is extremely unsightly and cannot be removed.    Secondly, it is completely unnecessary.  The tree will heal on its own.

Sounds like the relay that controls your heating coils or the igniter for the furnace if it is a gas fired unit. You need to have a electrician check all breakers for the heating unit, there should be one at the main panel in your house, usually rated for 60 amps and one on the unit that is also rated for 60 amps, check to see if either one is in 'tripped' mode, you can lightly touch it and if it is in the middle of the breaker, then it is tripped, if so, then turn it off and then back to on, see if the unit turns on? If they are not tripped, then it most likely is the relays or contact in the unit and you need a A/C-Heating contractor to come look at it. Your blower motor could be burned out also. A electrician can see if your getting power to the unit, after that, most states require a A/C tech to effect any repairs after that point. A two year old home usually still has a warranty, check to see if your covered, same for the A/C unit, read any manuals you find for your heating system also.|`|p8wEnCZDaa	Have you checked to make sure you set the thermastat to above the room temperature.

Some where there should be lighting instructions located on the unit. good luck.|`|BXyMOS2Daa	It sounds like you have a furnace that blows hot air, but you need to be more specific, there are a few different types of home heating. Is the "unit" a furnace or a boiler (a furnace heats air, a boiler heats water). Is it gas or electric or oil? If it's a boiler, do you have hot water radiators or steam radiators, and are they "baseboard" radiators or the old-fashioned big ones?    If you have gas or oil, you should be able to see if the furnace/boiler flame is lighting up. If not, make sure the pilot light is lit (the pilot light is a small flame that is always on, some furnaces don't have one and use electronic ignition instead). There should be instructions on the furnace door (sometimes just inside the door, so you have to open it) on how to check the pilot light, and how to re-light it if necessary. If the pilot light is lit, but you still don't get a bigger flame (like lighting a stove) when the heat is supposed to go on, call for a repair.     Your utility company probably has some "do it yourself" recommendations, so check their web site.

There could be some root rot in it.  Once the disease is there, it might be a little hard to destroy it.  Try the leaf cutting as suggested above.

As for my African Violet, I rarely water it and only when I can remember.  I used to water them regularly and had it placed near the window where there is enough sunlight but it didn't grow well.

jW8nfcA6aa	Get a stencil brush at the Hobby Shop.|`|X1jupF0paa	Do you have to spray it, it might be more effective to hand paint a clear enamel with the stencil|`|6oC80Fpraa	There is a spray adhesive made just for stencils.  It adheres the stencil to the object, but is low tack so it will come right off.    You also must have too much paint on your brush.  You should wipe off the paint onto a paper towel until your brush is almost dry.    Good luck
721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa	I've used them both and don't think one is better than the other as far as softening and controlling static. What it boils down to is which scent do you like better? After all you will be wearing it. At the moment I am using liquid Snuggle most of the time because I really like the smell. I like the liquid Purex smell as well. I noticed you said you were using that. Not sure if you use sheets or liquid but I can smell the liquid very well on our clothes.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	I use the regular Downy and i would recommend it! My clothes always smell fresh!|`|KncvAAdZaa	i think they all work the same|`|2sdOlbOxaa	I use all of them and right now I am obsessed with Snuggle - the green bottle.  OMG - I love the smell.  And the plus side they have it in the liquid fabric softener and the dryer sheets.
xNOloeJgaa	Don't bother.  I bought 2 several years ago.  One day I saw a mouse sitting right in front of one grooming itself.  Probably thought it was a radio.  Called the Mfg.  Set it back and they sent another one.  Same thing.  Now I use "sticky" traps baited with a "shelled" peanut.  Works great!!!|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	yeah my sister is addicted to the things...I don't know if they work so well...she gets spiders and ladybugs.

This could be in terms of their engagement eg do you want them to perform a song or a fully blown gig or do you want one member to turn up for a signing autograph session or all the band etc .    Its really not unusual for these kind of request to be taken up by the band or band members especially if you are doing it to raise money or if you have the funds to back it up.

Mice can get through a hole 1cm in diameter.  So block up all possible entrances including any airbricks.|`|IN48MUQRaa	Food is the worst idea.  You'll attract them and they will breed faster.    If you have pets, cover the food bowls or put them up high and feed your pets at short feeding intervals.  Prevent the mice from eating the pet food.  That is why they are in your house.    Once you remove their restaurant, they will (or should) move out.  Cover up trash cans too, if those are open.  Don't give the mice any excuse to stick around.

The electronic device did not keep them away. They just kept coming in. (Oh the droppings!) The cat could only catch so many. I picked up 1 box from heavenlyscentsofnature.com and put one pouch by the back door, one under the kitchen sink, one in the child's room and one in the main room. 24 hrs = Gone. No traps, no poison, no bodies.  So I keep them fresh and added one to each corner of the 2 car garage. Gone. I haven't had a mouse since. I was glad I tried it. I may work for you.

QuwtaH08aa	The heat and toxins from the cigarette would kill the seed.  The best thing would be a fully biodegradable filter; they are currently made of plastic and don't break down.  I wonder if the biodegradable plastic used in packaging (it's made of corn) could be made into a filter that didn't ignite?  One of the stipulations of tobacco companies production is that the cigarette butt must be self-extinguishing, so it would have to be flame retardant.      Even if the cigarette didn't kill the seed, most seeds have to have very specific conditions in which to grow, like being buried or have some sort of nutrient base, like animal poo (the animal eats the fruit and the seeds come out the other end) or like Matilija poppies and some Sumac require intense heat (forest fire) for the seeds to crack their tough outer coating and germinate.  Another factor is that not all seeds will grow everywhere, and widespread distribution of some seeds may cause dominating plants that kill native flora (like Kudzu in the South, and English Ivy in Oregon).  It's still a good idea to help the environment with cigarette butts instead of littering with them.  Good thinking!    Tobacco is actually harmful for some plants.  The plants in the tobacco family, like Tomato, Potato, and several flowering plants like Nicotiana, can get a leaf blight (disease) from coming in contact with cigarettes, butts, or even hands than have recently touched cigarettes.  If you have tomatoes, be very careful about where you smoke and deposit butts, and always wash your hands after smoking!|`|d0836e0785bb7c6faea2b62558249361aa	I think the heat from the smoke drawn through the filter would destroy the seed.    And if that wasn't enough, the chemicals caught in the filter didn't poison it.|`|AA12391712	Well Hey! If you disassociate the human angle (I must control EVERYTHING!!!) the butt is already seeded with enough microbes to recycle the whole kit and kaboodle in a decade or two.Don't see the "eyesore", see the habitat.  As for seeds in the filter being harmed, site the seeds in the outer parameter of the filter and some seeds don't sprout unless the come in contact with creosote.|`|zBKjUTyNaa	Oui Oui PeePee|`|C7SAdyC2aa	good thinking but you did not consider all the angles|`|MTbtsWtTaa	Or how about instead of littering (which is exactly what one does if they toss their spent cigarette butt on the ground), the butt is placed in a proper trash container or ashtray.      If it wasn't for picking up after fast-food eaters and cigarette smokers I'd be able to get a lot more work done.....|`|jcs8gis8aa	No, the butt is just a filter. And the white part (depending on the quality) is crushed leaves of the tobacco plant.
83afe7Dvaa	Last spring I seeded up some seeds that were 7 years old and all but 3 varieties came up! I ended up with 27 different kinds.    I didn't soak them, I just planted them into a seed flat with a light soil mix and misted them a few times a day and voila - they came up.     So give it a try, you may be surprised.|`|AA11027952	they should..i've never held on to seeds quite that long, make shure you pre-soak them for a couple hours first|`|03sLrNPCaa	Tomatoes are considered to be a long life seed good for four or five years if properly stored.

But as the other guy said, what have you got to lose.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Plant them and see what happens..What have you got to lose ?|`|97TgF0wmaa	you can find out for sure with a germination test. Slightly dampen a paper towel and place the sample seeds on it. Fold the barely damp paper towel it in half over the seeds. Enclose in plastic wrap or place inside a sealed plastic bag so it will stay damp. Label the package with seed name and date. Set the package in a relatively warm place (70 to 75 degrees) such as the top of your refrigerator or on a high shelf. Do not put it in direct sun. (Direct sun could cause it to overheat.) How Long to Wait: Check Seeds Often    The seeds should absorb water and swell. Check daily for germination and to make sure the paper towel is still just barely moist. Mist it lightly if it begins to dry out.    Depending on which specific plant you are testing, the seeds may begin to sprout in a day or two or may take several weeks to begin. Usually the majority will sprout within a few days of each other. When germination stops and no more seeds have sprouted for several days, you will know what approximate germination rate to expect from that batch of seeds.|`|EeFLajXxaa	What do you have to lose?

C7SAdyC2aa	here are five of them  Citronella grass is, of course, where companies get the citronella oil. This oil is put in candles and lanterns that can be burned in your yard to repel mosquitoes. Citronella grass is actually a tropic plant that grows to be six feet tall, so it might not be practical in the average suburban backyard.    Catnip  Catnip is an herb that is most commonly used to stuff in toys or feed to cats for their enjoyment. However, the oil from this plant has actually been found to be more than ten times better at repelling mosquitoes than DEET. Planting this plant near your patio or deck will help repel mosquitoes.    Rosemary  This garden herb also has an oil that repels mosquitoes. While they are attractive plants that both repel mosquitoes and can add interest to your cooking, they are truly tropical plants that are not hardy in cold climates. You can, however, grow rosemary in a pot and take it inside in the winter.    Marigolds  Marigolds have a particular smell that many insects and humans find objectionable. They are a good plant for repelling mosquitoes as well as insects that can attack vegetable plants and aphids. Marigolds are annuals with bright flowers that range from lemon yellow to dark oranges and reds.    Mosquito Plants  There are actually plants on the market that are simply called Mosquito plants. They are advertised as a plant that repels mosquitoes. There are different schools of thoughts on these plants. Some say they do nothing to repel mosquitoes, while other swear by them. More often than not, you can only find them through mail order and internet sales.    While all these plants repel mosquitoes in your yard, you can also make all-natural mosquito repellent from them. Simply crush the leaves or flowers to release the oils and put them in a quantity of alcohol or vodka. Once the mosquito repellent oils have infused the liquid, you can use it just as you would one of the more harmful chemical repellents.    Planting these plants that repel mosquitoes is a great choice for your yard. Not only is it an earth-friendly way of dealing with these pests, it will add beauty to your gardens, and will not jeopardize your health. These five plants that repel mosquitoes are great choices.|`|AA12391712	there is a scented leaf geranium that is purported to do that.|`|wLADk4OPaa	Yes  [lilium citronela]|`|k4T1Jgblaa	Yes.

D9x1QSgiaa	Everything you mentioned is great for KILLINg the mouse but you have to also consider two other factors:    1. The point of entry. Find out WHERE they are entering the house or the attic and fix it. I suggest that you make a very through inspection of the OUTSIDE of your house. Look for any crack or holes in the block walls. If you find something "suspicious" or wider than 1/4" I suggest that you purchase some insulating spray foam in an aerosol can (such as "Great Stuff") and seal it up completely. After you inspect the outside of the home...(including under the soffits and around the gutters) make an inspection of the basement from the inside.    2. Eliminate the food source: Mice and rats won't hang around unless they find a food source. Start with the kitchen. Only use garbage cans with lids. Use plastic bowl with lids (i.e. Tupperware type) to seal all dry foods, noodles and other "edibles" in your kitchen cabinets. Set mouse traps baiting with creamy peanut butter (mice LOVE it). Remove pet food from bowl before turning in for the night. (Mice LOVE dry dog and cat food) Concentrate traps in the litchen areas. Avoid using glue traps...(some mice can pull themselves off of it) be sure to check you garage or storage sheds for edible foods such as bags of dry pet food, corn on the cob, bird seed, or other food sources.    3. Be alert for mouse droppings. The are usually back, hard and oval shaped, no larger than 1/8" long.|`|TNM8TDnJaa	I work at home depot and a tip I heard was to plant mint plants around your house because mice can't stand the smell.

I know hedge apples work for spiders, roaches, and crickets. I have one in every room , 10 around the outside.

Rolling bottom basket out is all that is needed to access those.

Having just installed a new bathroom suite myself, I suggest that you put isolation valves on all the pipes and use flexi-hoses to connect to your taps and toilet supply. This way you can soon have the water supply turned on again and also it will help in the future if you can isolate each tap individually rather than having to turn off the whole house. This may be part of the building regs now anyway.

Sorry sweets.|`|83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	I wouldnt prune until their is any permanent damage, and the end of the drought and heat wave has finished. This will prevent any further, greater, die-back, from the point where it would have  been cut.  As there are plants with very fine shallow roots they can easily suffer during extended drought, and mulches, above ground, can conserve moisture - when there is some. See if yov can save any used dishwashing water etc, and give this to them, and then add a mulch.  Dont feed them until all is well, as fertiliser can dry roots out even more. If you can shade your plants, this may relieve them a bit too. With less leaves, they will lose less water, but I would really delay this.   For now, see what water can be recycled, if legal, mulch, shade, and wait it out. Use a fertiliser for acid loving plants, when they have over-come this major stress, they have been deeply watered, eg from rain. Trim dead parts off later.  Hope this helps. Good luck! Rob

AA11618602	It is a little late this year to get set up and going, even if you got the greenhouse tomorrow.     Still interested?   There are magazines like Greenhouse Pro  Grower Talks, etc.  that have for sale for lease greenhouses in the back of each magazine.     Be prepared to start cold, To buy heat, plastic coverings.  Turn on the water, spray out any lingering insects that are capable of overwintering.    Oh yes, in my state, Massachusetts the license to spray greenhouses is different than the license to spray farm fields!       I have learned to use beneficial insects more than pesticides, but some times , you will still need to clean up a prior mess!     I am not trying to be negative!

WcudvcLxaa	"Dracaena sanderiana and related species are popular houseplants, with numerous cultivars sold. It can survive in many indoor conditions, but indirect lighting is best as direct sunlight can cause the leaves to turn yellow and burn.    Although it grows better in soil, it often is sold with the roots in water. The water should be completely changed every two weeks. The water should be bottled water, soft tap water with very little fluoride, or even water from a filtered, established aquarium. It does best in bright, indirect lighting and temperatures above 15 C up to 25 C.    Often in large chain pet shops it will be sold in black slitted pots rooted in rockwool submerged, stating it is an aquatic plant. While it will live for months like this, it will eventually rot unless the sprouts are allowed to grow above the surface.    Yellow or brown leaf edges may be caused by too much direct light, crowded roots, or fluoridated or chlorinated water, the latter of which can be prevented by leaving tap water exposed to the air for a day before plant use. Salty or softened water can also cause this.    Twisted shapes can be produced by rotating the plant with respect to gravity and directed light sources. This is difficult to achieve for most home users, but not impossible with a lot of spare time and a lot of patience."  -wikiopedia

JoAfcy4Caa	Lollllllllllllll|`|jW8nfcA6aa	Cut rabbits and make lap joints. Coat it in 2 or 3 coats of Polyurethane. Back in the 1960's when Rustic stuff was popular some people did Resin coating which left a hard, smooth, seamless, see through top. If you are going to attach to a plywood subsurface you may want to run the bottom side of the planks through a plainer prior to cutting the rabbits and possibly a joiner( or hand plain ) the seam edges.|`|VUNTunxiaa	It would be easier to use a biscuit joiner than to cut and fit rabbits; gluing, then screwing the planks to the plywood substrate from the bottom will leave you with an unblemished surface (do not use drywall screws). I would recommend using some type of wood trim or molding around the perimeter, to keep the end grain from showing. That would also allow you to cut some strain relief grooves into the underside of the planks, to keep them from cupping.    Most Building, Health, and Plumbing Codes require that a counter top be "sanitary"; which translates to "Able to be kept clean & germ-free." Make sure that the sealer you use will meet this requirement. Remember, what you see on HGTV, especially on an International show, does not always represent construction that is Code Compliant.

bPrxRerMaa	If you don't need this outlet, it should be wired in series with the next closest outlet in the room. If you can find which circuit breaker controls these, turn off the power to them. Take the cover off the outlet preceding the one you want to disconnect. There should be two sets of wires. One feeding the outlet and one set going to the next outlet. Simply disconnect the wires that feed the outlet you are not wanting and pull them from the wall when you do the rock work for your door or just coil them up in the wall. Make sure you test the outlet you are dropping before you put the cover back on the first outlet to know it is disconnected. Bear in mind there might be another outlet following the one you want disconnected. You don't want to lose power to that one or others. Questions?

XpkhUBkGaa	Sorry for all the stupid and inane answers you've received. One would like to think that intelligence can be found within the confines of the answer section.    Your problem is a failing hot surface ignitor. Although the ignitor is glowing, it needs to draw about 3.25 - 3.5 amps to cause the main gas valve to open.

E5gaKzCsaa	Cast iron doesn't burn, so you must have burnt food onto it. Soak in hot water, scrub well with a green scrubby or even steel wool if the burned stuff is very  stubborn, then you'll have to re-season the pan. I do this by drying it off thoroughly as soon as it's clean, then setting the pan, with some cooking oil brushed generously on the whole inside, on a burner on low heat or in the oven at maybe 250F. Leave it to get good and warm, even hot but not hot enough to make the oil smoke, then mop the oil out with a paper towel. It might take a few times of cooking something with oil in it to fully restore the seasoning.

dXrHoLMCaa	go to a mobile home dealer... they have to buy them for the homes they set up as models.... they'll help.... it's usually a mobile home supply store where they sell the right size windows and doors and such for the homes....|`|E5gaKzCsaa	You don't buy the stairs, exactly, but you can buy pre-cut stringers, that's the notched part that the treads go on. Saves you a lot of figuring and cutting unless you've built enough stairs and have the tools to do that part easily. You just buy the stringer of the size you need, longer is better if you're not entirely sure because you can cut it down to custom fit, and then put whatever tread you want on it. They have them in wood, and I've also seen metal ones at Home Depot but only a few steps high. You can also just use plain 1x12 for a stringer, and buy metal brackets to fasten on to it to hold the treads. They may not be sold on-line. Call the store.

If the pipes are in the wall and have to be moved, you may have to tear out walls to get it done. It really all depends upon how easy it will be to get water and drain to the new location. Of course, then you will need to figure out what to do with the holes that are left from moving the water and drain lines.

An appliance repairman may be able to answer your questions over the phone too.|`|3W18HDxxaa	unplug it wait 3 Minuit's plug it back in, restart it|`|nEKTPaT6aa	Being a Kenmore branded Whirlpool, it's hard to tell if the bulletin applies. It's the only one that matches the symptom.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://secured.whirlpool.com/Service/SrvTechAdm.nsf/d12cd4888abce86285256a42005ea985/3976dc6fea92e1c385256fc4006611c9/$FILE/8178496.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://secured.whirlpool.com/Service/Sr...</a><br>  <br>  You'll probably have to paste it. This repair isn't a DIY. I would also cal Whirlpool customer service.|`|dGRq65eraa	You may have a stuck keypad on the dishwasher console which would require the touchpad being replaced.

Boil some water with a few habanero peppers for about 30 mins. Cool, strain and put it in a spray bottle. Spray your flowers and plants with it as often as you need to (depends on the growth, rain etc.). The pepper doesn't hurt the plants but it definitely discourages the critters.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	noting will stop them this time a year there starving,  you can simpley go buy some corn or a salt lick, and put far away from your flowers, and theyll eat that. <br>  <br>  <br>  but they tulips, and if they know your growing them, theres no stopping them, your just gonna have to hope they eat someone elses instead.|`|AA12314028	Go to your local barber or hair salon and ask for the hair that is on the floor.  Put it in old panty hose and hang around the flowers.  The human smell will keep them away.|`|AA10101297	I heard deer meat is very delicious

OS9ksvnoaa	Potrebbero piacerti i comodini in nichel satinato Brill (disegnati da Pinuccio Borgonovo) della ditta Flou: li trovi sul sito <a href="http://www.flou.it/comp01.asp?CACI=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.flou.it/comp01.asp?CACI=1</a><br>  <br>  Oppure ci sono i tavolini a due ripiani della serie Carlotta (disegnati da Antonio Citterio) della ditta Flexform, che possono essere utilizzati anche come comodini. C'è la versione tonda e quella quadrata, vedi sul sito <a href="http://www.flexform.it/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flexform.it/</a><br>  <br>  O magari preferisci lo spiritoso tavolino Rududù di Creativando: la struttura è in acciaio ma il piano tondo è in stratificato laminato (tranne una versione in acciaio inox lucido) con molte finiture a scelta (bellissimi quelli a specchio con la scritta "vivel'amour!", quello con la rosa o con la poesia). C'è anche la versione con il piano a forma di cuore rosso.

OS9ksvnoaa	Si, non è male. Costa anche poco.<br>  Ma non eri tu che volevi un comodino di design?<br>  Pensavo cercassi qualcosa di più esclusivo o almeno originale. Non ti piacevano quelli che ti ho consigliato nell'altra risposta? Troppo cari?<br>  Ciao e buona scelta!
